Also, since when do Daleks value the lives of other Daleks?  We've seen them execute each other before for being ""impure,"" what's changed?
But my biggest problem with the episode is Amy and Rory's divorce.  It's a spit in the face to fans of the show and the characters.  After seeing so much of their relationship develop over many seasons, I can't believe they would have gotten a divorce.

Turns out maybe my degree wasn't I expected and although I have quite an interest for some of areas e.g. GIS and databases (although I've only learned SPSS and access) what I really fancy is I.T. Everything about it.

So, I worked on a technical support (for the biggest telecomunication company in my country) call center (for a little while) where I configured networks (router configs, port forwarding, dhcp, IP-TV, windows/mac osx config/little Ubuntu tweaks (all of this I had learned before on my own)) and I left because there were some problems with my payments and tax discounts. I also fix computers at home, from hardware replacement to software related problems I solve almost anything.

I know HTML which I learned on my own but I never learned anything a little more advanced that I wish I could had like databases (SQL, oracle) and PHP.

I want to work in anything I.T. related, I'm not greedy, do you think I can get a job with what I've described to you? I'm a fast learner and working on a company in which I could learn the skills I stated before would be a-m-a-z-i-n-g.

Do you think there is any chance? Should I focus on GIS? 

TL;DR I want to work on IT but probably I don't have the neccessary qualifications

ps. if you want I can send you my CV in a PM.

Am moving to Bristol in a month and although I've played guitar for 6-7 years self taught I reached a plateau probably about 5 years ago.

*Apparently it was just 4OD being the usual high-quality streaming site we've come to expect. Although reports are mixed, many have said it works for them and there was a repeat shown on 4seven. Go try the 4od video if you're in the UK.*

**Original Post**

I thought I'd bring this up because I was about 16 minutes into watching it, (having already heard what I assume to be the ""distasteful"" joke Jack Whitehall made regarding her Maj), and the video suddenly breaks down to buffer like crazy. Figuring it was just 4od being, well, 4od, I refreshed the page and was treated to BFQotY 2011 instead.

The [link posted earlier](http://www.reddit.com/r/BritishTV/comments/15rym4/big_fat_quiz_of_the_year_2012/) in this subreddit has been blocked by C4 copyright for myself (and at least one other, judging by the thread comments) so has someone found an unofficial place to watch it and is willing to share? I'm pretty sure YouTube is going to be closely monitored for a while.

***If you could, upvote this for visibility? I really want to watch the remainder of BFQotY 2012 and I highly doubt C4 are going to broadcast a repeat tomorrow. If someone finds and posts a working link in the comments, it'll be easy for others to find too.*** 

*Super special awesome edit for the troglodyte in the comments that made a big thing about me not using the full name of the show anywhere in this post...*

Most hate in rivalry's are based around a teams supporters. The main reason why City fans would hate United fans would be because of the taunting and abuse the Utd fans would give the City fans about money, history etc.

I respect Tottenham Hotspur as a club. They have brought up good British talents such as Ledley King (who Henry said was the best player he ever played against) Gareth Bale, Jermain Defoe and Michael Carrick. I think all those players are/were great, especially 'the King' who I find to be one of the best defenders I've ever seen.

I love Villas-Boas and he seems like a very nice person, someone I will always admire. I wasn't a great big fan of 'Arry, but hey. The players you have and the football you play now is good, I'm not a fan of the chavvy players like Lennon, Walker, Defoe as people, but they are good English talents. Your club is nice and respectable, your not oil clubs, you don't play boring or dirty football, and you have a nice manager.

**I respect Spurs and don't mind them at all.**

But why do you have to hate Arsenal? All the Woolwich stuff happened **100 years ago** exactly, we moved to North London in 1913, were any of you alive in 1913? Spurs were trying desperately hard to move to Stratford not long ago, which would have see the end of the North London Derby, the most reliable derby in England, that never fails to disappoint these days. I for one would have hated that to happen, I love the derby, we should *all* love the derby, it's amazing. Do you not accept us as your local rivals? Do you not actually want a North London Derby?

We never over spend on players, we buy great talents and turn them into stars (even English ones these days!) We have a great history, and almost all of our players appear to be nice, genuine people.

On one hand, one might postulate that Time Lord existence is one of dualism: the mind/spirit and body are entirely separate. We could derive such an idea from watching the same Doctor, in his essence, regenerate while maintaining his identity as The Doctor.

That being said, we could respond by saying that, while The Doctor is able to regenerate, he is not able to *exist separate* from his body. He must always be instantiated in a body of some sort. Though he persists, he never exists outside of a body, thus perhaps suggesting that his mind and body, whichever body, are parts of an irreducible composite, neither of the two being reducible to each other, and neither of the two able to exist without the other.

However, we might also say that The Doctor exists as a successive entity, and with each regeneration, there is something of The Doctor himself retained. Although, supposing that there was an ""original"" from which all other successive regenerations proceeded is to suppose also that the original incarnation of The Doctor is his ""real"" form, and all successive regenerations are further and further removed from who he really is. This brings us back to the question regarding his essence: when born, was his first incarnation his ""real"" form, or just the first ""matter"" to which his ""form"" was married? And then, if after regeneration his matter and form are separated, thus dissolving his being, in his next regeneration can he really be called the same Doctor?

We performed almost the entire retinue of Hoops songs and demonstrated to the opposition what support is. Even when you're at rock bottom you have to cheer on the lads and we did that for most of the game.

Before the game I managed to get inside a Chelsea pub, they had a choice of individual cotton hand towels in a wicker basket or luxurious disposable three-ply hand tissues in the gents. We don't get that in the Springbok, where you dry your hands on your trousers.

3,000 had to wait outside the ground to get through 4 turnstiles. An experience that wound us all up and likely contributed to the energy of our support, along with the extortionate £60 entry fee.

We started the game quite strongly and didn't collapse back into our own half as I expected. Mackie had a chance at goal but seemed to lack the confidence to finish and their keeper made no mistake. Within 4 mins one of their players should have been sent off for a 2-footed studs-up foul on M’bia, but got away with it.

Most of the play was Chelsea taking shots on our goal from distance as our defensive players crowded them out of the box. SWP was having a bit of a poor game in the first half and passes out to him on the left wing were mostly too far forward for even his pace. SWP had come on for an injured Hoilett early on, so wasn't a starting 11 choice for Harry.

By half time I was feeling good about our performance; we'd shown character and a great work rate, taking all they could throw at us.

At half time the same arrogant twat with the mic that insulted us the last time we were at the Bridge did it again. This time he said that some old Chelsea player he'd just walked around the pitch - to prompted applause - had won more medals than QPR has in our entire history. Chelsea have amazingly poor tact and, as we all know, terrible PR. I've never heard any club employee speak to visitors like they do. They really can’t help themselves can they?

The second half saw a few very close calls, where Chelsea broke deeper into our penalty box and Lampard had a goal disallowed for off-side, then the tables changed and SWP did something he’s never done for QPR before and scored a goal in a league game.

Naturally the Rs fans went nuts. Grabbing random strangers and hugging them is only to be seen at a football game and at an ecstasy-induced rave party. At the Bridge yesterday, SWP provided the class A.

From then on I resumed the standing foetal position I’d not employed since the Man City game at the end of last season. That situation is not something you can understand unless you’ve experienced it.

Then, it happened. We won!  

Arrogant bald Chelsea twat with a mic: 0. The might Rs: 1.

Have it!

Ok now that's done let's get on with the transfer news;

* In one of those amazxing stories where the headline seems to contradict the content, [Edison cavani's](http://www.talksport.co.uk/sports-news/football/premier-league/transfer-rumours/130102/agent-claims-cavani-could-be-heading-premier-league-188391) agent claims he could go to the Premier League, but really he'll go to Spain...

* Schalke could be after our [Kevin de Bruyne](http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/transfer-merry-go-round-as-spurs-close-in-on-lewis-holtby-schalke-try-to-sign-chelseas-kevin-de-bruyne/)

* Another day another Brazillian as [Tasion](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2255957/Chelsea-sign-Taison-Metalist-Kharkiv.html) seems to have visited and spoke to representatives from Chelsea... Why we need another attacking midfielder I'm not sure, but the team sheet is going to look like one of my Football manager games from the 90's soon.

* [Wesley Sneijder](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2255959/Wesley-Sneijder-rejected-Arsenal-Chelsea.html) is available for free if you don't factor in his huge wages, which someone at Chelsea did apparently and decided not to sign him...

* [Inter](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4723560/Chelsea-transfers-Inter-Milan-eye-Frank-Lampard-Demba-Ba-signs.html) are coming in for Frank, they can fuck right off as far as I'm concerned.

* The latest news from our Ghanian namesakes; [Berekum Chelsea](http://www.ghanasoccernet.com/berekum-chelsea-decide-against-making-new-signings/) is that although they have sold a couple of players to Congo based teams, they'll be no more coming in, maybe they could borrow some of our attacking midfielders?

In July 2011, I secured a graduate position with a household name. I was tasked with setting up a social media presence and customer service system (i.e. dealing with customer service queries via social platforms). This was a new role and I was basically left to get on with it. So I did.

Now - it was a such a success that the workload has become so significant that I need two assistants. I was tasked with drawing up the specification and the interview test. I sat in on the interviews for these assistants whilst my manager 'conducted' them. I even marked the tests afterwards. I'll be responsible for directing their day to day activities, creating and delivering a training plan etc. but my manager will be responsible for things like lateness/absences. It sounds to me like they want me to do half of a managers job without actually calling me that or paying me the appropriate rate. Would you agree?

There's nothing in my contract/job description about training or supervising other people, just 'other duties as required by the business'. Am I getting screwed over? Bear in mind I'm still on the same wage I was when I started - and that's not particularly good, a couple thousand short of the UK average.

It is almost a throwaway plot device until we start to explore how it works. There is a lot of exposition in The Snowmen that suggests an important mechanism is at work.

The Doctor's Wife planted the seed that the Doctor wants to be able to talk with the TARDIS:

*DOCTOR: (stops) You did! (whirls around, happy) Look at us. Talking. Wouldn't it be amazing if we could always talk? Even when you're inside the box?*

Vastra says - Snow that has a low level telepathic field that responds to the thoughts and memories of the people around it. What if one of those ""people"" was a TARDIS? Stuck there for a long time while The Doctor mopes. Simean's childish creations are the best a human can achieve, but a TARDIS! Clara's origin may be in the thoughts of the Doctor's true constant companion, made real by exposure to the Snow.

And it is Snow that learns, Vastra goes on to tell us. ""Let's hope it is listening to the right people"". Well, the bitterness of a human is hardly on the scale of the conflicted longing creature that is the soul of the TARDIS, judging by The Doctor's Wife. Further wild speculation - the TARDIS may have also imprinted River during conception, explaining similarities in behaviour.

In Asylum of the Daleks we are treated to snow again. Everywhere. We don't see Oswin's body except in flashbacks she has. Is it that the personality of the Oswin Dalek is actually defined and corrupted by the Snow that had learned from the TARDIS earlier/elsewhere? Was Oswin ever really part of the Alaska crew?

Is the snow the mechanism of making the material girl? What if [Clara was born behind the clock tower of Big Ben](http://dailypop.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/child-regeneration.jpg), as she told the children? It was snowing then too.

Clearly the graveyard scene at the end doesn't show snow. But once the genetic hybrid exists, perhaps the snow isn't required any more?

I graduated in July and hence have been looking for work ever since. I must have applied to 200-300 jobs (without exaggerating). I'm tired of either not hearing anything, or being told 'you would be perfect for this job if you had *insert any kind of experience related skill*'. 

I just want a job. It seems like it's just a lottery at the moment to even get your CV/application looked at because of how many people apply to them. 

I don't even know why I'm posting. I guess I want advice on how to get a job? I'm just so tired of not getting anywhere...

""have arrived now in Romania. so here we go this is exactly what happened.""

""On the flight to Munich- and read the German papers Bild etc- looking for news about Holtby (front page story btw was Sylvie and Rafa splitting up)- read that he Holtby, had turned down Schalke's offer to double his wages and he would definitely not renew his contract. I was sitting in row 18 in the middle of the plane, and the steward says you can exit through the back door, so I turned around and to my astonishment, I saw the entire Schalke team had been sitting right behind me. they were on their way to Qatar btw, training camp etc. So I saw Holtby and thought I'll have a chat with him. Luckily we had to get a bus to the terminal, so i got in the bus went straight up to him, and told him I was a big big Tottenham fan, that I've just got back from the Reading game and that we've heard he might be coming to us. He smiled a bit and obviously didn't want to say anything, but Huntelaar- who was really nice, and friendly as the Dutch often are, just chipped in and said literally-""It's a done deal, all signed and sealed"". Holtby looked a bit embarassed, and then said ""well there'll be a statement in the next few days"". He speaks perfect English btw-'cos his mother's English, without the trace of a any German accent.and then we started to talk about Tottenham and WHL and AVB. The conversation went like this: he told me, he'd been over for the West Ham game, and he was really surprised at how poor West Ham were as they are in the top half of the table. I told him that they are a home team, and don't perform away. I said that WHL is an old fashioned stadium, and he said he thinks that it's great, the atmosphere is unbelievable, and that he loved being there.Then we talked about the team, and it was obvious that he'd seen every game, and how impressed he's been. I said that I'd been a bit sceptical about AVB, because I thought Harry was so great, and he seemed surprised, saying that he's a great young coach. I agreed with him and said I've been won over, and think we're playing some really good football, which he agreed with too, and really thinks we have a lot of very good players. We talked a bit about the PL in general, and about the Chelsea/QPR game, which we both laughed about. Altogether we spoke for around ten minutes.""

""I couldn't take any pictures 'cos the bus was so crowded, but I take it that people on here know who I am, and will trust me- but all in all. Expect him to arrive now or in the summer. I personally think it will be the summer, but everything today pointed towards him becoming a Spurs player. I got a great buzz from meeting him and Huntelaar- to whom I said. we've been waiting for you too, he laughed an said, you just keep waiting.""

My degree is in chemical engineering, graduated 2.5 years ago and have since worked in a mix of health and safety, administration and accounts.  At the moment I work part time as a health and safety consultant but not in London (where I live) and I'm not going to be needed for much longer, I'd like to find somewhere a bit closer to home and full time, although I'm happy to consider part time work as well.

I'm pretty open to most things, I'd love to find something related to engineering (I'd be looking at an MRes if I had the money) or something where I feel I am helping people.  However I'm also happy to work in any sort of admin, secretarial, accounts or such kind of role, I also do all the IT support for the company whom I do the H&amp;S for and would be comfortable in a support role (I've only offered support for windows networks but use linux at home so it's not an alien environment).  I've done small bits of a lot of different roles, mainly office based but I've done some time as a delivery driver too as I've always worked for small companies (with some temping work) so tended to do whatever needs doing.  I'm also open to bar or restaurant work, I'm well presented and friendly, have several years experience working behind a bar and in other customer service roles.  I have also worked in a shop (mountain sports) but while I am able to offer information and advice if I know the subject I can't sell someone something unless I believe it's the best thing for their needs - I am not a salesman.  I've done the usual season on a kids activity camp as well as volunteer work with a youth group (DofE and climbing) before uni and teaching climbing, kayaking and organising trips for both at uni.

Mostly though I'm intelligent, versatile, a very quick learner and generally do well at something quite varied in which I get to think and solve problems.  During my degree I obviously did a lot of group projects in which I usually took a research and analysing data role in these and was part of a team which won an international undergraduate competition in my final year (with a £10k prize fund).  I also find virtually everything really interesting, which is part of why I struggle so much to apply for jobs as almost everything seems appealing, unfortunately coupled with my inability to make decisions I don't know where to start.  I'm open to pretty much anything that doesn't involve a large amount of heavy lifting or dealing with bodily fluids.

If anyone has an opening that I might suit for I'd love to be considered, I can obviously forward my CV and anything else.  Alternatively I'm happy for any suggestions to help me find work, I'm just so useless at it - I wish you could do it in person, I feel I present so much better in person than I can do in writing!  I also waffle.  Oh and I'm a girl, 27, live in NW London, have a vehicle (small van) and generally happy to travel.",false,london_forhire,t5_2sdbo,null,null,default,[For Hire] Engineering graduate with varied experience,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/london_forhire/comments/15wzjj/for_hire_engineering_graduate_with_varied/

It's set before the Time War, although the exact timing hasn't been determined yet. Most importantly, it's set during a time when there are a great many Time Lords kicking about the universe. Each player plays as a Time Lord, traveling the universe in their own TARDIS. Players would have a great deal of choice in how they played the game– what chameleon circuit disguises they use, what upgrades they get for their TARDIS, what equipment and gear they use, what skills their character has, what they wear, what they look like, and how they play their character. Would you be be more like the Doctor, more like the Master– or would you be your own personality?

Anyway, tonight I was looking through the episodes I haven't watched in a while and thought, hey maybe I'll watch one from series 7! But even just looking at the titles and thinking about the Ponds' departure put a lump in my throat, and I thought ""No, I'm not ready for that yet..."" and then went about my business. It was a split second, but after a second I realized- I'm avoiding the newer episodes of a television show because I miss certain characters and knowing that they're gone makes me sad, sad enough to need a bit of a ""mourning period"" before I can watch their episodes again.

1. She's the essence of Time Lord. I outlined this in another thread, which is why I'm starting with it. The idea is that the essence of Time Lord got scattered across time and space, while being blasted through the Time Lock by the destruction of Gallifrey. Since she's not a proper Time Lord, regeneration doesn't work the way it should and instead causes her to simply come back to life in a different time. 

2. She is the spirit of Gallifrey herself. Like in the previous theory, she's scattered herself across the universe looking for a way to return. Clara's last words in both deaths urge the Doctor to remember... remember her the way she used to be, the way he (in his tenth incarnation) admitted he preferred to remember her. The 11th Doctor has shown us through Amy that nothing is truly lost if you can only remember it. Amy's memory was powerful enough to bring back the Doctor. What could the Doctor's memory be powerful enough to do? And how good or bad is the idea of bringing back Gallifrey?

3. She's another species entirely, and she's been sent through time to find the Doctor and search for clues that might help them stop the Time War ever happening. We know that two planets in the same system can have very similar inhabitants when Ten recalled having visited the Sense-sphere in the same system as the Ood-sphere. So it's entirely possible that the next planet over from Gallifrey has a species that also has a way to ""cheat death"" and come back to life (as before, coming back in a different time). Her urge to remember in this case is to remember some little detail from before the war that was overlooked by the Time Lords but that could have been essential in preventing the war, the destruction of Gallifrey, and the negative effects that surely must have had on Clara's home planet.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Crazy ideas about Clara I haven't seen yet,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/15xb7t/crazy_ideas_about_clara_i_havent_seen_yet/

I might. But that's my decision. I've been considering a Doctor Who tattoo for a little over a year now, and I still want to get it, so now I'm trying to figure out how to go about it.

I'm thinking about two quotes. The first is from The Girl in the Fireplace, which is one of my ultimate favorite episodes: ""One may tolerate a world of demons for the sake of an angel"". I'd probably get it on my left shoulderblade with a little tardis sitting next to it. Or something. This is why I would like some advice.

Secondly, there's another quote I'm thinking about. It's from ""The Family of Blood"": ""He's like fire and ice and rage. He's like the night, and the storm in the heart of the sun. He's ancient and forever. He burns at the center of time and he can see the turn of the universe. And... he's wonderful.""

My boyfriend thinks it's too long of a quote to throw on myself somewhere. But no matter how many times I've tried to choose a snippet of the quote, it just doesn't seem the same. But I'm not sure just how to encompass the whole quote and have it not look like a jumbled mess.

We (Missus, Labrador, Gecko, and Myself) are moving to Edinburgh in April. No reason other than we are stuck in a rut down here on the South Coast of England, and fancy a change.

So I just thought I'd pop in here and see what's what. 
We're currently looking for a rental property, and jobs. Can someone give some advice for what neighborhoods are not very nice, where we should avoid living? 
We currently pay near enough 800 quid a month for a little two bedroom bungalow, in a fairly working-class part of Bournemouth. We're looking to get something a little cheaper, really. Somewhere around the 650 mark, I think. What neighbourhoods do you think we should look at? We've got motorbikes, so transport isn't a major issue, but we'd like to be somewhere with fairly decent public transport links, so we can hit the town and still get home... I hear taxis are expensive.. more so than here?

Anyway, I am sure I'll be back with more questions soon enough.

Ooh, and I'm a postman, any other posties on here? 

Thanks!

Given the way the team is shaping up this could be the final piece in the jigsaw to turn us back into a truly competitive side (that is not to say that we have 'world class' in every position, but we have a solid first team with adequate cover and no makeshift solutions e.g. Shelvey up front).

I have punctuated my use of the colloquial '#10' since I am talking about the role in the team which is sometimes termed trequartista or playmaker, but the incumbent may not wear number 10 currently or, eventually, for Liverpool.

I read [this article](http://www.football-italia.net/25759/no-10-shirt-downsized) about the disappearance of the archetypal #10 from Italian football, or at least the disassociation with the shirt, and it got me thinking about who are the best in the world currently and who, realistically, Liverpool could acquire in the summer that would provide an apex to our midfield behind the front three.  An unearthed, or at least unpolished, gem maybe - one with all the credentials but without the stage?

Let's say, for arguments sake, this season we finish a respectable position in the league and gain access to the Europa League through league position or cup success - in line with expectations and not more not less.  We have money to spend akin to what was spent last summer but not Oligarch-riches.  We have a similar wage structure and so we won't be paying [Sneijder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Sneijder) £200k a week even if he's free and says he'll help out around the club shop when he's not playing.

The first player that comes to mind for me as a great find and a steal is [Cazorla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santi_Cazorla).  He's a versatile player and has the attributes to excel in that #10 role as he has shown for Arsenal this season.  But that's the benefit of hindsight had we known he was sitting around at Malaga on a sinking ship - now he's an Arsenal player and unobtainable.

The best option I can think of is [Jovetić](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevan_Joveti%C4%87).  I believe he'd be expensive - [Transfermarkt are talking about £22m](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/stevan-jovetic/profil/spieler_46104.html) and I've got little else to go on - but it doesn't appear FSG are unwilling to spend on the right players and he's potentially not *astronomically* expensive; Suarez-money?

There would obviously be [competition and he seems happy at Fiorentina](http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11866/8331729/Fiorentina-striker-Stevan-Jovetic-happy-that-club-kept-promises-made-this-year) who are riding high in Serie A at the moment but if they're pipped for Champions League football I don't see why he wouldn't see Liverpool as a good move, especially if we finish strongly and we can show the ambition to push on into the Champions League next season.

However, I do work with the bastard things and have somewhat come to terms with their madness, find below a guide on how to use a self-scan machine properly, as I find that most of the population are far too impatient to invest some brainpower when it comes to using them there is some information about how self-scan machines work as well. For those interested in the inner workings of such tortuous devices:


* This is the first and most important thing you should know, and will make your life as a self-scan customer much easier. **There is often a light near the scanner on the machine, if it is GREEN, you are good to scan your item. IF IT IS RED, THE SCANNER IS NOT ON, IT IS NOT READY TO SCAN YOUR ITEM YET.** Many, many facepalms have been had at people getting *furious* with the machine because they have not waited the second or so it takes for the light to go green, assumed the machine has scanned their item, put the item in the bagging area, confused the machine and made it come up with an error. **The machine makes a noise, the item comes up on screen, you put the item in the bagging area, the light goes green once it has been weighed.** *Only then should you scan the next item!*


* The 'bagging area' is a weighing scale. The machine knows the weight of *every item in the store* and so when you scan your item, it knows what weight to expect so that your not scanning a packet of crisps and putting a bottle of £60 Whiskey in the bagging area. This means that you should **never put your wallet, keys, other bags of shopping, child, pet or any other objects with discernible weight onto the bagging area!** Otherwise it will come up with an ""unexpected item in the bagging area"" warning and will waste your time.


* If you have a lot of shopping, so much so that it fills the bagging area, *wait for the light above the scanning pad to go green*, this is when the scale has agreed that the weight of the items matches the weight of the items scanned, you can now take your items off the bagging area and onto the floor so you can carry on filling your bags in the bagging area properly. **Never pile your items so high you form some sort of grocery based Jenga, this will only confuse the weight and further impede your supposedly speedy checkout experience.**

* **Items to generally avoid putting through self scan in general.** 

* Clothes (these are also security tagged, and always, ALWAYS go missed out on self scan due to busy colleagues, save yourself the hassle of being stopped by security on the door or having to come back to get the tags removed by just going to a manned checkout.)

* In store baked goods often fluctuate a few grams from the weight on the system as guidelines give a %10 discrepancy on the actual weights in regards to the guideline weights and this is enough to set off the system.

* DVDs, CDs and Games are often fussy with the machines and so are some electrical products.

Now to further break down this process, into an exact, step by step guide. Here is a breakdown of *exactly* how to use a self scan machine.


* **1.** You have amassed your shopping into a basket, or a trolley. You approach the self scan machine. Place your basket into the area provided next to the scanner, or if you have a trolley, place it near there so it does not get in the way of other customers.


* **2.** If you have your own bags, press the 'I have my own bags' button, and place your bags in the bagging area to be weighed. **The machine is expecting empty bags, so if you place already full bags into the bagging area, it will always request approval from the operator.** Wait for the screen to clear and the light just above the scanner to go green, then begin your fantastic foray into buying things. *If you do not have your own bags, you do not always have to even press the 'start' button, if you want to save that precious half a second, scanning your item immediately will skip this step.*


* **3.** Take your items, one at a time, and scan the black and white barcode across the scanner. **If you are buying vegetables** have a look on the product, sometimes fruit and veg will have barcodes, sometimes not. I've seen many people assume that these machines are psychic vessels of vegetable knowledge, *they are not*. Supermarkets identify fruit and veg through a number system called 'PLU coding', those little stickers you see on apples with a number on them? That's the PLU code. Most self scan machines have a section where you can pick what vegetable you are scanning in the 'look up fruit and veg' section, **place your fruit/veg item onto the scanning area, it is also a weight** and then press whatever fruit or veg you have, it will be weighed and then the machine will expect the said weight into the bagging area. Place it in! **Pro tip.** If you pick up an item with a strange sticker and number on the side, press the manual barcode entry button, put your item on the scanning scale and put the strange number in, it will often be the PLU code for the said item and will save you some bother.


* **4.** Put your item *straight into the bagging area*, do not give the item immediately to a child, or put it back into the trolley your packing into it. *It must be weighed*. So stick it in the bagging area and wait for the light above the scanner to go green. Then go nuts, do whatever you want with the item, throw it across the store for all I care, I'm not your dad (or the cleaner).


* **5.** Repeat 3 + 4 till all of your shopping is through the machine and your ready to pay.


* **6.** Press the finish button when you are done (or, if paying by cash, just put your money straight into the coin or note eater and it will save you that precious half a second.). Some machines have little coin funnels just below the scanner and **not** the ye' olde' individual coin slots on the machine itself. Many times I've seen people stand for *minutes* trying to figure out where to put their coins, what makes this even more baffling is that the machine is usually covered in stickers telling you where to put your money. *If you're paying by cash, skip straight to 7, if not, keep reading*. If you're **paying by card** press finish, and then press the card button *wait for the chip and pin machine to tell you to put your card in, if you put your card in before then it will waste your time and tell you to take it out and make you start all over from the payment screen.* Then put your card in the machine, now most machines will offer you cashback *on the touch screen of the machine* please do not zone out and stare forever into the pin machine waiting for it to prompt you to put your number in as this will usually lead to your transaction timing out and you wasting time, **wait for the cashback screen on the touch-screen, pressed your desired (if any amount) then you are ready to put your PIN number in.**.


* **7.** Take your shopping, go home and live your life and spare a thought for the poor bastard that has to spend their day dealing with these machines and the equally sordid customers that use them.

I shall be doing this every three days, with the two days break to allow my self to indulge in special features or if I wish to watch another TV show/film. 

After each review I shall submit my thoughts on the episode, maybe my favourite parts or even changes in my opinion. I shall also be visiting the classics (well it wouldn't be honouring who without it), and discussing those. I also invite everyone to start a discussion, as I love hearing different peoples interpretation and response to an episode.

I shall start with Series 1, Episode 1: Rose

Well I thought this was fantastic, I thought it was a great way for the show to be brought back after a long hiatus. I  particularly loved the mystery of the doctor in the view of the companion, rather than taking it from his point of view. It was reminiscent of An Unearthly Child in the way that there was a mystery to this character and the investigation the companion underwent. I thought the Autons were a great way to acknowledge the history behind it, they were a nice touch to classic fans yet an easy start for the Nu-vians. I found Christopher Eccleston's doctor brilliant, very alien which is how the doctor always should be.  One thing I really like is Clive's death and the mention of Wilson's death from the start . I believe the show doesn't take as many liberties now a day with just killing off guest characters, I mean if the aliens attack that's what's always going to happen. There are no bad aspects about this episode and it has an excellent re watch appeal to it so I'm going to award it:

Craig Owens 2 episodes are 2 of my favorites, because he's such a normal guy and he is both in awe of the doctor, and his mate.

I just started revising for exams when we start 2nd term. 

I just think I wouldn't mind having an average job. I don't need lots of money to be happy. I'd be fine being a cook or a teacher or just having a boring office job. Mainly because these aren't really mentally taxing. You don't have to memorise a ton of info and worry about what you'll be examined on. My whole life it's been study study study and spit out info during exam time.  

Someone said I should take a gap year and return Sept 2013 and get a job between the times. Maybe do something OTHER than study and I'll see that I want to go back to this degree. I'm afraid I'll probably still not want to come back to study lol. I did some odd jobs during summer like some DIY for pocket money. Painting, putting floorboards in, trimming gardens etc. It was awesome that these jobs don't require you to sweat your brains out.

I'm Kieran ""DreadKnight"" Ghataora and I'm currently streaming a lot of DotA 2 with my current UK team!

**About us:** We're all a bunch of students who have known eachother since DotA 1 and been playing together for about 3 years now and decided to recently step up the ante! We've recently been sponsored by Team eNigma after we started winning some minor tournaments like the UK DotA Cup.

Our aim is to start placing well in some international tournaments and gaining ground again in the competitive DotA scene. We're also going to be attending LANs such as epic10 in Feburary!

**The Stream:** This is my personal stream so some random stuff will go up on there, however the main content on the channel will be me streaming high skilled DotA scrims. I'll be streaming with comms up and everything so you can see exactly how we do what we do!

I'll try and be responsive as to whatever's in chat and we're all pretty friendly even if our humour might be a bit abrasive.

Hope you can join us! :)

She dies once in the Asylum, and again in 1800s London. A friend mentioned to me that he thought she could be River Song.

He was saying this, thinking of River Song before she gave the Doctor the rest of her regeneration energy. Obviously, this couldn't be, since she didn't immediately try to kill the Doctor on sight, and the only reason the Silence would have released her is if she was completely bent on killing the Doctor. She also had no knowledge whatsoever of the TARDIS, and every time she dies, she looks exactly the same, so she can't've regenerated.

But then I thought if it was River Song after the events of ""Silence in the Library."" River's consciousness, and the consciousnesses of the rest of her team, are saved in CAL. What if Clara landed on the Library, dying, and CAL took her, gave her a chance at life, and put all of those consciousnesses into that one body.

At any one moment, all of the different consciousnesses are battling for control. Hence, why she didn't recognize the TARDIS--one of the other consciousnesses was in control at the time.

Clara, then, could be an acronym for the names of the five consciousnesses. To be honest, I don't remember the names of the people on River's team at the Library. But it could be.

His chairman could decide that now is the time to cash in, before it falls any further. 

#2 It's the off-season in Brazil. So there can be no excuses of wanting to see the season out etc. South Americans are generally more likely to move to Europe in the January window than in the Summer IMO.

#3 (I've heard that..) His club, Internacionale, failed to qualify for the Copa Libertadores which is the South American version of the Champions League. That could mean that's he's less inclined to stay if true, and that they might need to trim their wage bill slightly. 

#4 We are obviously still interested and still need a striker. See VB quotes, the fact that we've not given up on him for about 2 years and the fact that we STILL need a striker. Defoe/Ade have been good, but it's evident that we are still lacking up front and need a player that suits the system more.

#5 Securing CL qualification. So far the VB project has been a great success, but can we risk falling at the final hurdle and not making 4th? It'd mean being set back (at least 1) year, possibly losing Bale and generally stuttering. Levy might see this as being a signing that would greatly lessen that risk.

#6 The AVB &amp; Sandro effect. It's a lot more attractive signing for a foreign club if the coach and the most popular player speak your native language

#7 Our partnership with them. If he goes anywhere, then it'll probably be to us as we have first refusal.

#8 Money talks. If we can get a bid accepted then I suspect we'd be able to offer him a wage that he wouldn't be able to refuse. 

#9 Tottenham are currently a very attractive prospect: 3rd place in one of the biggest leagues in the World, new coach, new ideas, new signings, positive quotes flying around everywhere. 

#10 No real rivals for the signature. No ""bigger"" clubs, or at least clubs with significantly bigger spending power, want him as far as I'm aware.

Responsibilities include:

* Helping to run the prediction league
* Checking the spam filter and dealing with posts that should have been let through (This may be a slight exaggeration. As in, there isn't any)
* Reminding me every so often that I still haven't done the spritesheet for the image flair
* Posting regularly

Benefits include:

* Being able to make your username green whenever you want
* All the ladies (or gents) will love you
* You also get access to the modmail which, I can assure you, is where all the cool kids hang out.


Basically, we would like someone to help out with some of the jobs, so if you'd like to do it, leave a comment below telling everyone why you should be a mod.

Every body is talking about wondering who may be showing up, and I've thought of the perfect story for it all.

**STORY:** So, as the universe is collapsing from another disaster (Daleks or Master, someone else can pick), Eleven is cleaning up the mess from foiling their latest plans. Preferably something that actually explains why nobody remembers the last major Dalek invasion of Earth. The Universe's walls had broken down and our Universe had collided with two others. (Rose &amp; Ten's, and another 'mystery' universe.) 

Over the previous episode, a mystery character has been helping Clara &amp; Eleven. And he remains to help Eleven clean up the mess, but warns the Eleven this will be the toughest fight he has had so far.  

Into the episode, a TARDIS appears with a fleet of Dalek &amp; Cybermen ships. An alternate version of Eleven, the Time Lord Victorious has gathered the Doctor's strongest enemies to destroy him after leaking through. In the battle, Eleven is mortally wounded, but fights off his regeneration. Victorious takes over his mind for a moment to poison his will. 

The mystery character refuses to let Clara intervene. When Eleven begins questioning how this character knew about what was going to happen and refused to let anyone do anything, with a snap of his fingers he reveals his TARDIS; and himself as the Thirteenth.

Thirteen has re-united the Doctor's companions; Amy, Rory, River, Jack, Martha, Mickey, &amp; Sarah Jane.  Another TARDIS appears, with Rose, Ten, and Nine. (Explained as in that Universe, Rose never existed, so Nine had never regenerated. Ten is his clone.) 

None of the Companions knows why Thirteen has gathered them all, and he won't tell them. But, basically, when Eleven finally is forced to regenerate, Victorious splits him among Universes. The version that remains with everyone else, as the walls are put back up, is The Valeyard. 

So, I have not worked out details, but simply put...

***TL;DR*** Eleven dies, Twelve is born, but corrupted into the Valeyard. 5 Doctors, all companions return. The four surviving Doctors send Valeyard back in time to face his demise against the Sixth &amp; Seventh Doctors.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,50th Anniversary Episode,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/15yy1d/50th_anniversary_episode/

**Spoilers for all the major plot points of new and old series.** 

&gt;Inspired by [this photoset](http://whatthefoucault.tumblr.com/post/39270688382/just-bringing-these-back-for-some-reason) and the Series 5 episode The Big Bang, here is a head!canon AU I dreamed up where, after the Doctor disappears into the crack in time during The Big Bang, history rewrites itself so the show is about a series of remarkable human women traveling the universe in a borrowed alien time machine that is passed down from mentor to student. Each new assistant eventually becomes the senior-most traveling companion and must select and train her replacement.
&gt;
&gt;**Classic Who:**
&gt;
&gt;* Susan Foreman is an orphaned alien runaway with no blood relations. She bequeaths the TARDIS to her two human teachers, Ian and Barbara, in gratitude for all they’ve taught her. As her departing wish, she tells them to pass it on to others with a childlike sense of curiosity and wonder.

&gt;* Barbara and Ian train Vicki and Stephen. Vicki and Stephen train Ben and Polly. Ben and Polly train Jamie. Jamie trains Victoria and then Zoe.
&gt;* Jamie McCrimmon and Zoe Heriot are apprehended by the Time Lords, who can not abide the idea of two uncivilized humans bouncing around space interfering in history unsupervised. Jamie argues that there are evils in the universe that must be fought, but his plea falls on deaf ears. The Time Lord judges decree that the humans’ memories will be erased. Having planned for this possibility, Zoe remotely activates the TARDIS’s “fast return” switch and sends the unoccupied time machine to an undisclosed destination beyond the Time Lords’ reach. Because the Time Lords have already started the process to erase Jamie and Zoe’s memories, the secret is lost forever.
&gt;* The empty TARDIS delivers itself to Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, whom Jamie had met previously and trusted. The Brig immediately hires a scientific advisor to study the machine: Dr. Liz Shaw. For a time Liz and the Brig battle alien threats on Earth using gadgets that Liz is able to backwards engineer from her studies of the TARDIS.
&gt;* Liz’s workload grows and the Brig insists on hiring her an assistant: Jo Grant. Though Jo is hardly a scientist, Liz is far more fond of the young girl that she admits.
&gt;* The episode “The Three Companions” features Liz Shaw teaming up with Jamie McCrimmon and Susan Foreman to save the Time Lord’s asses from a black hole.
&gt;* As reward, the Time Lords grant Liz the knowledge needed to get the TARDIS flying again. Liz and Jo take off on adventures in time and space.
&gt;* After Liz retires to Cambridge, Jo adopts reporter Sarah Jane Smith as her new traveling companion. Sarah Jane’s professionalism contrasts well with Jo’s hippy-ish enthusiasm and the two become fast friends.
&gt;* After Jo leaves to pursue her social and environmental interests, the friendly and unconventional Sarah Jane takes on proper military doctor Harry Sullivan and teaches him to be a bit more relaxed and open minded.
&gt;* After saying a fond farewell, Sarah Jane accidentally leave Harry in Aberdeen instead of Croydon when the TARDIS relays a summons that whisks Sarah Jane away to Gallifrey.
&gt;* Sarah Jane accidentally becomes President of Gallifrey for a day and a half while trying to unravel a deadly assassin’ plot.
&gt;* The thoroughly modern Sarah Jane meets the thoroughly uncivilized Leela and both learn a thing or two while traveling together.
&gt;* When Leela must embark on a quest for the Key of Time, the White Guardian assigns her an assistant: a recent young Time Lady graduate of aristocratic bearing named Romana. The instinctive Leela teaches a cerebral Romana the virtues of flying by the seat of one’s pants.
&gt;* Before departing for E-Space, Romana trains the lonely boy genius Adric to be her replacement.
&gt;* Adric adopts two surrogate older sisters, Nyssa and Tegan.
&gt;* Tegan trains Turlough. Turlough trains Peri. Though at first Turlough seems arrogant and slight untrustworthy, eventually his friendship with Peri reveals a warmth and hidden humor underneath. 
&gt;* Peri trains Mel. Mel trains Ace. Though at first Mel seems cheerful and harmless, through their travels together Ace comes to see that the analytical mind that made Mel a good computer programmer also makes her inclined towards scheming strategies and manipulation, sometimes at a terrible cost.
&gt;* When Ace is shot stepping out of her TARDIS onto the streets of San Francisco on New Year’s Eve 1999, her life is saved by the surgical expertise of Dr. Grace Holloway. Overjoyed to find herself alive, Ace kisses her surgeon on the lips, breaking one of the unspoken taboos that had previously governed the behavior between TARDIS traveling companions.

&gt;**Time War:**
&gt;
&gt;Time War breaks out on Gallifrey. In desperation, the Time Lords draft anyone who can fly a TARDIS to help in the war effort. Exiles like Susan Foreman and Romana are called home. Former agents like Jamie McCrimmon and Liz Shaw are forced back into service. Ex-Presidents, including Sarah Jane Smith are summoned. Associates like Leela, who married a Gallifreyan guardsman, are recruited. Ace and her companion, Grace, race to help as well. 

&gt;The Time War proved too terrible for any one human being to stop. It would take a truly wonderful and impossible sort of person to single-handedly stop the Time War, …and no such person exists. The former companions sacrifice themselves one by one to position Ace in control of The Moment, ready to set off the biggest bang in history.
&gt;
&gt;**New Who:**
&gt;
&gt;*(Cough… So, uh, fair warning: in this AU, New Who becomes very femslashy very quickly… which I find hilarious, to be honest.)*
&gt;
&gt;* As the conflict’s sole survivor, Grace Holloway emerges from the Time War emotionally scarred and changed forever. However, the friendship and optimism of a young London shop girl named Rose Tyler teaches her to live again.
&gt;* When Rose absorbs the time vortex energy at the heart of the TARDIS in order to save Grace from the Daleks, Grace kisses Rose on the lips, absorbing exactly half of the time energy, which is just enough so that Rose won’t die. Both women are changed by the experience and thereafter their relationship becomes more that between equals rather than mentor and pupil.
&gt;* When Grace is trapped in a parallel universe before Rose can tell her how she truly feels about her, Rose is heartbroken. She takes on a new companion, medical student Martha Jones, whom she insists is not replacing Grace. Martha is obviously smitten with Rose Tyler, but Rose is too traumatized by the way things ended with Grace to really notice. 
&gt;* When Rose is forced to stop traveling to take care of her family after they are traumatized by the Master, Martha declares that she is “getting out” and departs to start a new chapter traveling alone in the TARDIS.
&gt;* Martha quickly picks up a new companion, the irreverent Donna Noble, with whom she shares a refreshingly platonic, sibling relationship.
&gt;* When the walls of reality start to break down due to a plot by Davros to detonate a Reality Bomb, former companions team up and Rose and Grace are finally reunited. In order to foil Davros, Donna is forced to absorb the time vortex energy stored in Rose and Grace’s heads. This allows Rose and Grace to retire and live a normal human life in the parallel universe. However, the time vortex energy threatens to cook Donna’s brain.
&gt;* Donna manages to have a few more adventures even though she knows she’s doomed to die soon. Eventually she is unable to stave off the inevitable, though, and just after she stops the return of the Time Lords and saves her grandfather, the knowledge she absorbed overwhelms her human brain. 
&gt;* Donna sends the TARDIS to sit on a street corner somewhere collecting dust, ignored and forgotten and the wondrous story of the blue police box that was bequeathed to the plucky human race by the unearthly child, Susan Foreman, comes to an end.
&gt;* …until Amy Pond’s wedding reception, when Amy starts to remember an impossible, bow-tied man and history completely rewrites itself again.

As you can see we take in about £42bn a year from corporation tax. 

But from what I'm seeing basically no big company in the UK pays the actual rate we've set for corporation tax. They'll just funnel their profits out of the country using offshore consultancies and companies that they own until their UK profits show as basically nothing. They seem to pay a token amount of corporation tax which is entirely arbitrary and at their whim. 

So, what's the point? Why bother at all with corporation tax? 

Couldn't we just reduce it to something nominal like 2.5% (Because the public would never support 0%) and then become the tax haven on the edge of europe? 

66m people, educated workforce, English speaking, low corporation tax with access to the european market. 

What company wouldn't want to set up shop here? I think we'd see a rise in industry again for starters. 

I think there'd need to be limits, though. To stop everyone and their dog creating their own corporation and then paying 2.5% income tax you'd need to probably add an employee limit to unlock the 2.5% corporation tax rate.

So, upset by this, I sent back the jersey, having to pay for another one while waiting for a refund on the other. The next jersey arrived today, and again, I was so excited. I opened it, examined it, and all was well. No creases, no weird folds or anything. However, above the Samsung logo was about a 4-inch long, 2-inch wide white stain. I had no clue what it was, so I threw it in the wash after letting it soak a bit. 



Upon it's finishing in the wash, I turned it back right-side out only to find that pesky little stain staring me in the face again. Infuriated, I called the Chelsea mega store again, letting them really have what I thought. They offered an exchange if I send back this one, so I'm giving them one more opportunity to get it right. 



Has anyone else had this problem with getting jerseys from Chelsea? Are they usually this bad with their quality check? I'm paying a little over 130$ and I expect perfection. It's very disappointing to feel like the Chelsea merchandising organization doesn't really care much about me or the quality of their product.

She refers to the doctor as ""boy"" which can be a flirtatious way or it can be literal in the sense that the message is from someone that knew the doctor as a child. This reason is why people are probably saying it's the ""Tardis."" But maybe she's a time lady? Perhaps Clara is another result of Time Lords trying to escape the time-locked time war?

The reason I'm stuck in between these two uni's is because on the one hand, I'd love to be in Cambridge. I love the place, the atmosphere, and, let's face it, the reputation. On the other hand, I'm an avid jazz musician, and would hate to give that up (the jazz scene in London is considerably larger than in Cambridge). I'd like to be a researcher, and I'll probably stay in Academia all my life, or maybe research for a company. But I will not go into finance, business, or most things economically related. I hear however, that Imperial is really good at this, and I'm wondering whether or not it's reputation as a university is based a lot on this (but that won't help me).
I hope that someone can clear up any misconceptions a possible future Cambridge student would have...

Both sides will use this game as a chance to rest, rotate and test players.

QPR need to maintain a winning mentality. Building on Wednesday's unexpected and hard-fought win would put real belief into the QPR camp and maintain optimism among fans. A great performance from a product of the QPR youth system and life-long QPR supporter DJ Campbell would work wonders.

But what if everyone forgetting about him is what actually brings it all about? If everyone in the universe knows who The Doctor is (""the oncoming storm"" etc) then why would they have to ask ""Doctor who""?

The one missing is the Doctor's Mother.

Some clues
""Clever Boy"" = I've only ever been called a clever boy by my English mother and grandmother.  

We have met the Doctor's Mother before.  She is the women who comes to Wilfred in the End of Time.  She is the only person to convince the Doctor to take up arms (though it is through Wilfred).  So, the Dr's mother has a way w/ words.  And the last word I'd have used to get the Doctor to help me would be ""Pond.

The Doctor's Mother appeared to Wilfred on Television, and in other places and then vanished.  So she must have seen the end of the Time War coming and done things to help her son survive.

It's Smaller on the Outside = A time lord would be used to the many forms a Tardis could take, and I think a police box is probably the smallest version it could take.  Her twist on the saying makes sense for someone who has seen the inside of a Tardis before.

And Remember = Not sure but my guess is that we learn more of this phrase as she dies each time, and remember me to your father or something that will make the audience realize who she is.  This is a bit of stretch I know. 

Instant connection = We've seen this before w/ Rose and her Dad.  He instantly trusted her w/ his car.  And what does the Doctor instantly trust Clara w/ ... the Tardis.

Asylum of Daleks
Not converted due to her intelligence = The Doctor is always prized for this by the Daleks as well.  
We assume that she was able to hack into the Daleks systems because she was one, but what if she just knew the Daleks a lot better than the Doctor becuase she grew up fighting them.

* Tottenham left-back Benoit Assou-Ekotto is set to make a comeback after recovering from his knee injury.
* Scott Parker may also make his first start of the season and Gareth Bale is available following his one-match ban.

* The Sky Blues hope loan signing Leon Clarke is cleared to come in up front.

*****

**MATCH FACTS**

**Head to head**

* Tottenham hold a 42-26 winning record over Coventry after 90 league and cup matches.
* Spurs have won the last three, culminating in a 3-0 victory at Highfield Road in the second round of the League Cup in September 2003.
* Their most notable clash was in the 1987 FA Cup final at Wembley, when an unfortunate own goal from Gary Mabbutt in extra time, gave Sky Blues' managerial duo John Sillett and George Curtis the crowning glory of a 3-2 victory and the silverware for the first and only time. Spurs won both of the only other two FA Cup meetings, in the fifth round in 1981, and in third round in 2002.
Tottenham Hotspur
* Only two clubs have won the FA Cup more often than Tottenham's eight; Manchester United 11 and Arsenal 10. Only Coventry have beaten them in an FA Cup final.
* Spurs may not have lifted the trophy since 1991, but the North London side have been semi-finalists in two of the last three seasons.
* The White Hart Lane club have gone out to fellow Premier League sides in each of the last six seasons, subsequent to Championship Leicester in the third round in 2006, and although held to a goalless draw by Stevenage in the first match in last season's fifth round, have not succumbed to third tier opposition in 25 years since Port Vale in the fourth round in January 1988.
Coventry City
* This tie cannot help but evoke memories of Coventry's greatest day in their history 26 years ago, since when the best achieved has been two quarter-final appearances; 1998 and 2009.
* Mark Robins has taken the Sky Blues from one off the bottom in mid-September to the top half of the League One table. He will always be remembered for virtually saving Sir Alex Ferguson's job at Manchester United with a winning goal in a vital in a FA Cup third round tie at Nottingham Forest in January 1990. The Red Devils went on to win the cup from there, Ferguson's first piece of silverware at Old Trafford.
* Coventry are 52 places lower than Tottenham in the league standings, and are one of three third tier clubs trying to oust Premier League opposition, as they did in the fourth round in 2011 when, as a Championship side, they eliminating neighbours Birmingham City.

As we all know, the Doctor has been getting darker and darker.

The Time Lord Victorious, who 'won' the Time War, has seen the return of the Daleks, as well as wars and insurmountable odds, The Silence, The Cybermen, the deaths of the Ponds, etc.

He lived on a cloud atop Victorian London in isolation, occasionally visiting with the closest thing to friends he has.

The misery and loneliness of a Timelord is a powerful force, and may eventually lead him to become the Valeyard. The Valeyard was said to occur between his 12th and final incarnation.

Now. Assume for a moment that the Silence are correct, and, in some screwed up morality - right. They intend to stop the Doctor before the fall of the eleventh at the Fields of Trenzalore.

“On the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the eleventh, when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, a Question will be asked, a question that must never, ever be answered.”

I think the answer will be the answer to the ""time lock"", whether its the Doctors name or anything I don't much care. The Silence are attempting to kill the Doctor before the Eleventh (inadvertantly?) unlocks the Time War at his death on Trenzalore.

Here's an even more insane theory. Trenzalore is on Gallifrey.

Something to do with Clara allows a breach of the Time Lock. 

As she appears to be able to die and reappear in a different region of space and time, I don't see any reason she couldn't appear on Gallifrey, either before or during the Time War.

As the Doctor is chasing her 'signal', as it were, he would be left with an item that existed inside the Time War (ala the white point star).

The Doctor travels to Gallifrey to save Clara, and ends up at Trenzalore.

The Doctor, and Clara, at Trenzalore. When the Eleventh fell.

The Valeyard was obviously able to travel to Gallifreys past, as he was there during the time of the sixth Doctor, so either they will ignore his storyline entirely or at some point soon, the time lock will be broken.

Due to the release of the Time War, the twelfth witnesses the evil created by the release of the insane Time Lords, Daleks, and the other monstrosities of the Time War, and becomes the Valeyard... it'd make a hell of a moment for the 50th... ;)",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"Season 5, 6, 7 and 50th theory (spoilers)",37,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/160bh0/season_5_6_7_and_50th_theory_spoilers/

16 Corner now after some great work from @Knaughts88 who cuts inside and shoots but the keeper saves.

17 One way traffic at the moment. Coventry clear the corner and we have it on the half way line.

19 Chance! So close. A fantastic run from @GarethBale11 who beats 5 players and shoots across the keeper but it goes just wide.

23 Chance! @GarethBale11 cuts inside into the box and shoots right footed across goal but it goes wide.

25 Clint Dempsey takes a shot. Emmanuel Adebayor gets a block in.

-More on the goal; @clint_dempsey takes a shot inside the area it takes a deflection into @GarethBale11's path who taps in for 2-0

(Radio guy from City-Watford match just said City has now had their 8th corner, they're on for some sort of record...clearly, he didn't watch Spurs vs. Villa)

36 Corner to us now. @GarethBale11 to take it.

36 GOAL SPURS! 3-0 @clint_dempsey...we scored from a corner!!!

-More on the goal; @GarethBale11 takes the corner and @clint_dempsey rises at the back post to head in for 3-0

39 Steven Jennings takes a shot. Tom Huddlestone gets a block in.

40 Almost a chance for Coventry, a cross comes in from J.Clarke but @Knaughts88 defends it well from the on rushing Coventry attackers

40 Coventry force only their second corner of the game but Friedel isn't threatened at all by Moussa's inswinging delivery.

42 Coventry almost grab a goal! Suddenly Spurs are opened up and a slip from Naughton sees Leon Clarke with almost the penalty box to himself. However, he takes too long to set himself and the Spurs defender manages to clear the ball while lying on the floor.

44 Coventry are just beginning to exert a bit of pressure here. McSheffrey brings the ball forward and his delivery is cleared by Caulker for a corner. From the set-piece, Clarke brings the ball down and is set to pull the trigger only for the referee to pull it back for a suspected foul on Caulker.

45 Fantastic technique from @clint_dempsey as he controls on his thigh in the box, then flicks it over his head &amp; shoots but it goes over

HALF-TIME: Spurs 3 - Coventry 0

-Spurs legend Gary Mabbutt is on the pitch at half time and he gets a great reception as he talks about his time at the Club.

46 We're underway in the second half

46 Free-kick to Coventry 35 yards out and central to goal But it hits the wall and goes out for a throw.

48 Adebayor runs through on goal and looks set to put his side 4-0 up only to be eased off the ball by Edjenguele. The striker is claiming a foul but in reality, that was just a combination of very good defending from the Coventry man.

49 Sub for Coventry; Moussa comes off for Barton

51 Adebayor doing his part to convince Levy we need another striker...runs the ball straight out of play on a run

53 Excellent play once again by Bale who produces a gorgeous back hell that sets Assou-Ekotto away. The full-back collects the ball, jinks into the box and threads a ball for Huddlestone to strike only for it to be blocked by the defender.

56 The pattern of the second-half looks set. Tottenham a little lax in possession but still retaining a sense of control that is enough to stop Coventry in their tracks whenever they smell an opportunity. ""Forward!"" screams a Spurs fan. There's just no pleasing some, even at 3-0 up.

57 Chance! Sigurdsson is played in by @Knaughts88, he crosses but Coventry just about clear.

58 Spurs' best chance of the second half and yet again, it's come from a corner. Steven Caulker thunders in with a header and should really find the net but instead it flashes wide.

59 Free-kick to us now for a foul on @GarethBale11. It's three yards outside the Coventry box. @GarethBale11 stands over it...

60 Inches wide! @GarethBale11 strikes it side footed at goal but it goes just wide. Great effort.

61 Substitution: Connor Thomas in for James Bailey...if Thomas is anything like he is for me in FIFA13 managerial mode, he will boss the midfield and get 2 assists...we shall see

63 Shot from Coventry - it falls to Loen Clarke who takes a shot from 30 yards but it goes well wide.

64 Adebayor has really had a poor afternoon today. He's just halted another promising Tottenham break, with the impressive Edjenguele robbing him of the ball. He will be disappointed as he will have fancied getting on the scoresheet against Coventry today. Instead, he's looked rather leaden footed and off the pace.

66 Coventry win a corner and Edjenguele heads at the front post but @friedel_b saves and we clear the danger.

69 Chance! @GarethBale11 waltzes through the Coventry defence and shoots with the outside of his left but the keeper makes a great save.

70 We make our first sub and it's @GarethBale11 who comes off to a standing ovation and is replaced by @andros_townsend.

70 Coventry also make a sub as Jennings comes off for Fleck. (They've now put in half my FIFA13 managerial team)

72 The tempo has completely dropped now and no surprises that has happened after Gareth Bale has left the field. Coventry are still fighting hard but unfortunately, they just don't have the quality to make any inroads. Clint Dempsey has an ambitious effort that goes nowhere near.

79 Crickets...

79 Double substitution for us as Sigurdsson &amp; Scott Parker come off for @tom_carroll92 &amp; @mousadembele

83 Chance! @andros_townsend is played in by @clint_dempsey, he crosses with power and pace but Coventry clear.

84 Chance! @andros_townsend picks up the ball and runs at Adams, he cuts back onto his right foot and shoots, but it goes just wide

86 Free-kick to us now for a foul on Caulker who came marauding forwards from defence. 40 yards out, slightly left of goal.

86 @TomHuddlestone6 touches the free-kick to @clint_dempsey who shoots low and hard but it goes wide. Good effort.

88 Chance! We counter and work the ball to @andros_townsend who cuts inside onto his left and shoots inches wide!

90+1 The Coventry fans are jumping up and down, thinking they've grabbed a consolation through Gary McSheffrey but the flag was up for offside very early against him. Only two more minutes left here of added time.

Full time: Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 Coventry City. SPURS HAVE FAILED TO SCORE IN AN ENTIRE HALF AGAINST LOWLY COVENTRY CITY #AVBOUT!!!!!!

But I'm struggling to work out how it all works. First off, a blog is just a wesbite right? I'm not sure why it's called a blog. But how do you go about finding decent websites/blogs? I want to find some good, independent blogs. How do you subscribe to them? A lot of them seem to shun rss.

Does anyone consider themselves knowledgeable in this field? I want to find a couple of blogs to inspire me, and do some research and stuff, but atm I'm just finding it hard to locate any that I care for. I think reddit has almost ruined the internet for me. I struggle for to make much sense of the net outside of reddit these days.

How do I locate decent blogs relevant to my interests? Is there a network of them? I don't just want to look at what are basically online magazines with huge budgets.

Since then we’ve added [Triggertrap Mobile](http://tri.gg/mobile), a combination of hardware and mobile apps that lets you trigger your SLR camera from your smartphone in 14 different ways.

This is a fifth doctor serial where he is joined by companions Tegan, Nyssa and Adric. The first episode is the same as any first episode of a classic serial. It has a slow pace that's main purpose is to introduce the plot and characters of the episode. We know that something is in the caves, but what? Well the ending reveals it to be the cybermen after a 7 year absence. Now I do wish that the DVD didn't advertise their presence as I think it would have been much better for the reveal to be a shock, as it was on broadcast. As I already knew I found myself quite uninterested by the presence of androids and the whole mystery as to what was going on. Luckily I was engaged by the Adric and doctor plot in the episode. I hadn't seen any serials with Adric before so I was oblivious to what was so famously infuriating about him. I simply thought he was annoying. I could sympathise with his wishes to go back to his home planet, so he wasn't an off put of the episode. 

My main problem was the cybermen in this. They aren't cybermen. They don't sound robotic enough or devoid of emotion. The cyber leader frequently used the word excellent, which displays gratification. Without emotion they wouldn't be able to comprehend this word. Although I like the 80's design I was distracted at times by the fact I could see the actors mouth moving underneath the mask.

It was the cybermens intention that made this a great episode. The threat was an a level of great proportions, with the cybermen not only attempting to wipe out all life on earth but also the leaders of other civilisations. It makes them a truly formidable threat. 

Adrics death was truly the highlight of the episode. Apparently a despised character he truly redeemed himself with his heroic sacrifice. I felt the silent credits added more to the emotion of his departure. It was nice that the doctor and Adric solved their differences beforehand, it not only means they departed on good terms but also adds to the drama in the case that Adric expressed that he still wishes to travel with the doctor. A great end for the character. 

I would also like to express my fondness for the charachter of captain Briggs. I thought she provided great comic relief for the serial, always witty and sarcastic. I found myself ammused when ringway claims he had apprehended the prisoners and she responds with 'why can't you just say caught, why be so melodramatic'  

Tl;dr - great story with great plot, slightly slow start, fantastic redemption of charachter

Me and her engaged in a whovian discussion for a good 5 minutes. 

Then I left.

I couldn't get her out of my head though. I went to go pick up a pizza after I left and on my drive back to my house I was passing by the Walgreens. It was going to bug me till I asked her. I walked in and asked her to coffee so we could talk more about Doctor Who.

We're dating now, and she's the coolest girl I've ever met.

Edited: I am terrible with the English language despite it being my first one.

As you know were almost at **6,000** subscribers, making us one of the biggest individual football subreddits around! Were starting to grow and increase at an exciting rate and each day new, interesting, Good looking people are joining and sharing from around the world.

To celebrate Im going to be making a team photo style picture using Reddit aliens stood, sat on, holding up (creative things) around a BIG 6000. 

**'So how can we help?'**

Great question!

The reason I am asking now is because this may require some time to do and I want to make sure Its finished by time we hit 6000.

What I would like to do is create individual aliens that depict **YOU** the amazing users of this fantastic subreddit to give the picture a more personal feeling!

There are two ways you can do this..

1. Upload a photo of yourself to the comments or PM me it (wont be shown to anybody else).

OR (if like me you bare a striking resemblance to Ronaldo and are worried your fellow reds would be envious of your looks;)

2. Tell me how you want your alien to look! (mohawk, green skin, weight lifting, Garden Gnome, pixelated, such and such..) 

[**Example of Kazez2 request to be a chef**](http://i.imgur.com/kBscD.jpg) (Dont mind little mistakes on large copies as they are shrunk down a lot)

this will just give the photo that more personal feeling!

**Simple Request..**

Please no nudity, nothing offensive, nothing *too* difficult or crazy..

If you know Photoshop/vector/good at Graphics and would like to help PM me

**thanks for the compliments but please stop...I've said many times before YOU guys are the awesome ones, i like to make posts and such because YOU are all amazing, I in no way deserves this kind of praise, if you want to praise someone praise the mods for doing such a hard job day in and out, you wouldnt believe all the shit they deal with on a daily basis** 

**Update:** 40 mins in not one request..this might be easier than I thought

**Update:** Ok...so this has taken off

**Update:** Holy Mother...

**Update:** [Who wants a sneak peak at a **VERY** early concept of the setting? No aliens in yet..](http://imgur.com/iTL54)

(note - the episode was called silence in the library - though the obvious reason is that the library was silent, perhaps it has to do with the silence, some kind of hint - maybe because the first time the doctor meets river, she's in a space suit, a kind of foreshadowing? Or maybe there's something more, something we do not yet know about the library) The Doctor meets River, it's clear that while he does not know her, she knows him very well. It becomes clear that the Doctors future is River's past, and vice versa. When River whispers the Doctors name into his ear, it becomes clear to him too that, though he does not yet, a form of him trusts her as much as he trusts himself. Sort of like in the episode with Clara, he knows ""not why, only who."" That's the pattern with the people he meets, with his companions. . He knows them, and trusts them first, learning the ""why"" at a later point. It's the exact same pattern with River. First he trusts her, and he's slowly learning the ""why."" Why does he tell her his name? He says ""there is only one reason"" he could, but he never actually says what that reason is. We all just assume that it's marriage. But if that's the one reason, why does the Doctor bother asking River if she's married? He should already know the answer.

Still in season seven, the Doctor only just learning who she is, where she came from, he still doesn't fully know why she means so much to him. As with other companions in their early stages, he has yet to figure that out. That's one reason why he found it easy to flirt with Clara. Not only did she pull him out of solitude, but without River there as a constant reminder of how important she is to him, it can be easy for him to forget about her.

At some point in the future, the Doctor knows that it's his last time seeing River before she goes to the library. This point in time must be very far away from when the Doctor first meets her, because she exclaimed how young he looked. Where we are now in season seven, it's only about 300 years farther into the Doctors life. That's NOTHING for a Time Lord, he considered himself a child at 90. There's a lot of River-Doctor left before this moment, before he learns why he trusts her so much.

It's even possible that he only tells her his name at the Fields of Tranzelor, where he must answer for a (as of now) unknown reason. Maybe River only knows his name because he needed to tell her.

Regardless, at this point in the Doctors future, the Doctor and River's timelines begin to converge. He can't just not send her to the Library, he knows that, because that would prevent him from meeting her and learning how much she means to him.

He's had hundreds of years to think about how he can save her. He could've given her something to use to connect to the computer rather than herself, he could've thought of a billion different ways to keep her from dying. But he doesn't. Instead, he gives her his Sonic. With a neural relay built in, for that precise moment. Why? So that he would know where she was after sending her. He's tired of running, he didn't want to need to look for her, to hope that their timelines coincide.

I bet

that right after sending her to the library

the Doctor goes to the library

to find his sweetie

who was saved

who HE saved

The Doctor's ability to travel fearlessly through time and space is reliant entirely upon his trust in the TARDIS to bring him where he needs to be, even if it's not where he wants to go. After all, existing through all of time and space means the Time Vortex knows what the result of bringing The Doctor somewhere will be before it happens.

In ""The God Complex,"" The Doctor is given a room at the hotel because there is something he has complete faith in, what could The Doctor trust more than the Time Vortex/TARDIS? To further parallel the themes of that episode, the TARDIS abandoning The Doctor would do to him almost exactly what his abandonment would do to Amy.

Did that experience lead to him questioning his own faith? Is his vow of inaction a refusal to do the will of the TARDIS in retaliation for allowing his friends to die? To me, it gives a lot of context to the comments about the universe ""not caring"" and why the impossibility of Clara still being alive being the universe ""making a deal."" No doubt to try and win him back as the TARDIS is nowhere near being done with him.

      For a team of such lucrative wealth, such exorbitant wage fees and such lofty expectations, the Blues of London town, that majestic squad of both boisterous and skilled professionals known as “Chelsea FC” sure have made the year quite interesting. In a year where they have fired Roberto Di Matteo after he himself replaced Andre Villas Boas,  hired Rafa Benitez, crashed out of the Champions League, saw a return to form by Fernando Torres while blowing out teams by 4 goals and then lost to the worst team in the Premiership only to bounce back and win 5-1 a week later; it’s sure been something to write about.

    Lost in the high tension, high reward headlines of the team’s season however, Fernando Torres has silently rebuilt his form, started to contribute regularly and has become somewhat of an offensive talisman for the London club. Looking beyond Juan Mata’s midfield mastery, one in which he has become one of the best in the world in just 2 short years, you see how Torres has not only finally given Mata a capable Striker to link up with, but has made him better as a footballer as well. Lost in the prodigious talent of Beligan international, Eden Hazard is the fact that Fernando Torres has allowed Hazard to drive forward, create space and become every bit the offensive dynamo that people expected him to be. People started to draw towards Hazard and Torres made them pay dearly for it. However, when people got hip to the recent run of form that “El Nino” had displayed, Torres showed the maturity of a veteran Striker, pulling defenses while giving people like the aforementioned Mata and Hazard, along with Victor Moses and Oscar, more room to play the pitch and join the attack. 

    Sadly however, as is all things with their Russian oil magnate and his ownership, nothing good ever lasts. Torres has scored 14 goals this year and looked like he had finally regained the form that would make that $ 50 Million POUND contract worth it, and if anything, like a bargain. Rather than that though, Abramovich has fallen in love with yet another duo of Strikers, in Atletico Madrid’s Radamel Falcao and Newcastle’s Demba Ba. Falcao would prove to be too pricey and unable to be purchased, but just two days ago, Demba Ba was bought, brought in as yet another Striker, another offensive player to add to the litany of those who already walk the hallways at Stamford Bridge.

    While Ba had a marvelous debut and scored twice in a 5-1 rout of Southampton, one has to remember that this is a Southampton that is stuck in a relegation battle, fighting for their lives as they met get dropped from the Premier League for their quite horrendous run so far this campaign. It’s not like Ba was scoring twice against Manchester United. Regardless, while Ba played, Torres was placed in the stands, watching from afar as the man with 14 goals was reduced to nothing more than a spectator.

    Even Victor Moses, who was playing as the Second Striker, a man who hasn’t nearly produced in the same manner as the mercurial Fernando Torres, saw more playing time, Torres left to rot in the stands as the team celebrated the rout. Sadly, a rout like the one today will only give Ba more playing time, will only see to it that Victor Moses, who HAS come on as of late, become a more integral part of the team and a man who has scored 14 goals at the halfway-point of the campaign…rot in the stands.

    What raises the most consternation and the most bitterness from me however, is the fact that Torres was brought in from Liverpool and Chelsea was head-over-heels for him. They cheered wildly, the said it was a major coup. They proclaimed themselves champions and reveled in their purchase…and then they sat him behind Didier Drogba.

    Torres for all his warts, was never properly given time to develop within the Chelsea system while Drogba was there because he was made to sit behind the man from the Ivory Coast. With FEARLESS JOHN TERRY and Frank Lampard both part of the “Old Guard” along with Drogba, they weren’t going allow the new boy to get his shine at the expense of a man they had won Premier League titles with. So Torres sat, and in sitting, he lost some of his skill set and he lost some of that momentum he had built up.

    Anybody who plays soccer will tell you, repetition and playing time is what develops skill and develops class. You could have the most skill in the world, but if you don’t play regularly, you’ll start to lose what makes you one of the best. For examples, look at Wesley Sneijder at Inter, Kaka at Madrid or Nani in Manchester. Torres sadly, became the victim of politics, came off the bench and was put in the miserable situation of having a huge contract that demanded he score. When he was left without consistent playing time and limited opportunities to produce, he started to fail, and once he did, those boo-birds came raining down, the same hypocritical bastards that spent all transfer window praising him and shouting his praises.

    Funny thing happened, though. Torres won them that Champions League title last year. He single-handedly beat Barcelona. He scored a ridiculous goal that clinched it and played his ass off in that Semi-Final. The Chelsea boo-birds suddenly turned around and praised him. He won the trophy and he STAYED while Drogba fucked off to China or Russia, or whatever the fuck, Shanghai Shenhua, to be exact. When he did, those people who SCREAMED, “YOU’LL NEVER BE DROGBA” …started proclaiming him to be their boy, their man, their leader and their Striker. Fickle bastards.

    Even funnier is the fact that Chelsea signed Rafa Benitez, the man who initially managed Torres when he was at Liverpool and made him into the player it was. More truthfully, if it hadn’t been for Torres, Rafa Benitez would have been fired much sooner than he ended up  on the outs at Liverpool, and he never would have managed at either Inter Milan and now, Chelsea. Torres made Benitez by scoring as much as he did. Now, with Torres at Chelsea, Rafa decides to sit him because he has the big-time job and the Russian oil oligarch as a boss? Please. Where’s the loyalty?

   What’s necessary to note is that as soon as Torres was given time to play consistently and was given the full confidence of the coaching staff that he was going to be “The Man” at Striker, he regained his form to the tune of 14 goals in half a season. He looked motivated, he looked every bit the predatory poacher of the past, and while he may not be the same kid with blazing speed he was at Atletico or Liverpool because knee injuries have robbed him of that, he HAD CHANGED HIS GAME to accommodate your best two players on that squad in Juan Mata and Eden Hazard, linked up with them, built chemistry and made THEM better.

   To sit Torres and not even give him ANY playing time today, at all, with the fact that Rafa wouldn’t have this job if not for Fernando and the knowledge that he, and two others and they alone have made this team function, is utterly ridiculous. What will be more ridiculous is when they continue to sit him and he eventually loses all the momentum he had built back up, loses confidence once again and reverts back a bit.

   The boo-birds will come out, the chants will return and everyone will blame Torres for the team’s shortcomings. Until he scores another big goal. Until Demba Ba leaves for another team like his fellow African. Until Chelsea needs Fernando to step in and make yet another star turn. Until Chelsea needs Fernando to be the “good soldier” again. 

Like he did last year.

Like he does every year.

   And then? It’ll be the same chant we got earlier this month and earlier this year, with those goofs in blue chanting “FERNANDO TORRES, HE SCORES WHEN HE WANTS!”.

My family (my wife and daughter) and I are moving to Wales in February and I'd love to hear some input on where I can find some nice, reasonable housing. Let me just qualify that statement by saying that I have no idea what ""nice, reasonable housing"" is in Wales or how much it would cost.  Since we will only have my income for the first few months, I'm thinking we are looking at something between 500-600pcm and 2-3 bedrooms.

We need to stay within a 30min drive/train ride from Cardiff. I've been looking at some places in the Vale of Glamorgan, but I'm also open to Caerphilly and the surrounding areas. I'm somewhat familiar with south Wales, but am hoping to find out more information about schools, areas to avoid, etc. 

So, if you have any input on places where we should be looking, as well as tips on rent (how much should we expect for a ""nice, reasonable"" 2-3 bedroom semi-detached/detached/bungalow, etc.) I would love to hear it.

Hello /r/travel! I'm from San Francisco, California. I've never traveled an inch outside of the United States without my family present. I've always been a huge anglophile, but my parents have never been interested in traveling into Europe, but they have offered me this chance to follow my dreams of traveling in the UK. Although a silly dream, I one day would like to expatriate to the UK. However, as for now, traveling is good enough. I am current a high school Junior, who's currently planning his senior graduation trip for the summer of 2014.

**Location Options**

* **UK**: England and Scotland.
    * Cities to Visit: London, York, Chester, Oxford, Cambridge, Worcester, Lincoln, Bath, Brighton, Clovelly, Whitby, Staithes, Edinburgh, Glasgow. 

    *I will most likely remove some of these options if it doesn't fit into the schedule.*

    **Note**: If you have any more suggestions on towns and cities I should visit, I really enjoy towns/cities with cobblestone streets, picturesque port towns such as Staithes, and quaint villages with friendly people. Comments with genuinely beautiful cities/towns/villages with pictures are appreciated. 


**Attractions &amp; Things to Do**

* Visit a Castle. If so, which one?

* Eat and drink in a pub for the first time.

* Visit [Heady Beach and the seven sea cliffs.](http://i.imgur.com/XLKaK.jpg)

* Go on an adventure in the [Lake District](http://i.imgur.com/bOvWs.jpg)

* Gawk at [Platform 9 3/4](http://i.imgur.com/o2GD1.jpg)

* Visit the [Warner Bros. Harry Potter Studio Tour in London](http://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk)

* Possibly go to a concert of my favorite Irish or British artists. i.e. James Vincent McMorrow, Mumford and Sons, Ed Sheeran, Rachel Sermanni, Orla Gartland, Ben Howard, etc...

* Try Fish 'n' Chips.

* Visit [Shambles, York](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-XzIijnC2tJI/UE9803Qy-RI/AAAAAAAAcrM/iwqGHHrzyQg/the-shambles-14%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800)

    **Any more suggestions on things to do see/eat/visit would be extremely appreciated!**



**Budget**: $3000-$4000 including airfare. 

* *Question: Is this budget reasonable for how long I'll be staying there?*


**Timeframe**: 3 weeks to 5 weeks. 

* *Question: Is it reasonable to visit these cities/towns between 3-5 weeks? I know Clovelly is small and I'd be there for less than 2 days. So my question, would I manage to fit all these places in my itinerary?*


**Companions**: A fellow English redditor would most likely accompany me for at least a fourth of my travels.


**Accommodation**: Will most likely stay in the cheapest hostels when I'm traveling with friend stated above, but I'd like to couch surf when I'm alone. 

* *Question: How in advanced should I contact people when Couch Surfing?*



**Transportation**: I will most likely go with the BritRail Pass for England, Scotland, and Wales for 22 days.

* *Question: Would buying single tickets on National Rail be better? How so?*

**Food**: Of course I'd like to try eating at restaurants and pubs, but for most of the trip, I'd be fine with eating cucumbers, bread, and cheese from the grocery store. 

**Luggage** I'll be out and about a lot. I have no clue what to bring.

* *Questions: What is essential to bring to the UK? Should I pack extremely light into a 50L Backpack with a smaller day pack or is a suitcase just fine? I will be doing a bit of exploration when outside city centres and such.*",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,(x-post /r/travel) Looking for help/tips/recommendations on high school graduation trip to the UK.

I am 23 years old. 

My education level is high, I have twelve GCSE's with eleven of those grade A to C, including Maths and English.

I have four A levels in Law, Media Studies, Art and Design, and Music Technology. 

I have a Cert HE in Video and Film Production. 

I have a good knowledge of basic computer use, such as word processing, and power point. I also have a certain degree of self taught knowledge in photoshop.

My previous employment history is in retail, and I also have experience in bar work, youth work, and volunteer community work, including strong leadership and organisational skills. 

In my spare time, I like to make things such as costumes and props, which is what I might ultimately like to have a career in.

My friend and I started a business a couple of years a go and have recently had to cut things down due to work load on other projects, and people going away for placements etc.

It started as a website, [Student a2z](http://www.studenta2z.com) and quickly turned in to an events and promotions company. (Helped with Vodka Bay, Aztek, Big Night Out trips, Essence promotion, The Masquerade Ball and much more)

My part is basically maintaining the website, and we want the website to stay up until next year when we can get our team together again.

This is a very brief explanation of what is happening, but I am currently trying to create a ""Social"" area mainly aimed at freshers where they can turn to for help and advice, and other general things that may help students. You can find the [link here](http://www.studenta2z.com/canterbury/index.php/social).

I am just posting here to find out your opinions, if you think this is even necessary and if anyone would like to help out, join and so on.

Any feedback would be great. Our aim is basically to just make things easier for students in Canterbury; our motto being ""Helping out with the little things.""

&gt; Regarding image submissions, the image must contain content related to Chelsea.

There's currently two examples of posts that break the role on the front page currently, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/160olb/celery_found_this_in_rwtf_and_thought_it_may_be/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/160hhy/my_reaction_when_i_was_told_the_match_wasnt/). The amount of posts that either come close to breaking that rule, or break it outright seems to be on the rise and we're looking to gauge if there's any support for having the mods remove such posts outright. At present we try to leave a disapproving comment but their effectiveness is questionable, and we have no intention of allowing the place to be over-run by ""low-quality posts"". Another possibility is to force meme submissions to be made through self-posts. I feel it's too much ""easy karma"" for some submitters and if they can't gain anything from it, it could cut down on them.

Essentially what I'm trying to say is everyone is welcome, we like meeting new people, etc etc [insert pleasantry here]. 

As always, time and place are not set in stone so if another time/day or venue would suit the majority better, then it can always be changed. Of course, anyone is welcome to organise a meetup too - guidelines are in the sidebar.

He never just coasts through games, he always wants to have a huge impact and make his presence felt.

Anyways, this got me thinking. I think this is a perfect way to describe Lennon this year. You could say it's because of the different coaching styles of AVB and 'arry and how Lennon is being used differently, but I feel like under 'arry, there were matches that Lennon was on the pitch just to be on the pitch, and that's why he was so inconsistent (also injuries). Under AVB, Lennon has had a big impact on most matches and a HUGE impact on a few. I feel like his decision making is better, his confidence is higher, and he wants to be that game changing type player now and that's really why he's been so consistent all year...

In my opinion, his performances of late deserve a starting place in the team, but who should he replace? When Pilkington is on form, as he has been in most home games recently, he is great, and one of our most dangerous players, but all too often he is completely anonymous - West ham being an example of this. Interestingly he has scored all his goals this season at home. Against Posh though he played fantastically at the role fulfilled by Hoolahan normally - does Hoolahan deserve to loose his place? I reckon that he should start a match soonish at LM, replacing Pilkington, who i really think needs some competition not to become too complacent, and being dropped to the bench might just provide the kick up the arse that he sometimes needs. Hoolahan for me has been in our top 3 players of the season: literally all of our goals coming from open play are either assisted by him, or are assisted by someone who was passed to by him. I just don't think Bennett (or anyone else in the team for that matter) has the levels of creativity Wes possesses.

I'm currently applying for jobs in the sales/marketing and/or recruitment area which I want to enter. Below is my dilemma:

Should I mention that I own a small-time business in my CV? It's basically re-selling electronics for a small profit and I've been doing it for about 1 year, basically it acts as a part-time job through uni.

Here's why I think I should mention it:
- It sounds enterprising and stands out more than a typical student job.
- It shows genuine creativity to make money independently.

Here's why I think I shouldn't mention it: 
- It sounds small time, i.e. It has connotations of Dellboy and the 'off the lorry' type culture. To a corporate group, it may appear too raw and get taken as a joke.

As you can see, I'm hovering whether to put it or not. For what it's worth, I'd say my current CV is fairly plain, I have mentioned my academic successes and all the buzzwords, 'Hardworker, motivated' etc...I also have very little work experience with an office summer job if that helps.

Thanks!

Hardly any of this episode made any sense. Characters were introduced (who the heck was that old lady, and how could she appear like that?) with little to no reason behind their existence, characters randomly gained powers (Master can shoot lightning? What?), the strength of the Doctor was inconsistent (he survived a hugeass lightning bolt that killed one of his superiors, jumped out of a ship, etc) and characters would do things for no reason (I'm just gonna walk up to the Master and get shot by fricken' lightening. Great).

The whole thing seemed like a contrived excuse to pander to the fanbase and give a bit more of Gallifrey to the Whovians. It was nice to see Rose again, though.

Anyone else agree or have explanations for the things I've mentioned?

EDIT: Thanks for the conversation! You have proved that I am not, in fact crazy. When I watched the episode I thought that for sure I was missing something.

I have just started watching this series about maybe a month ago and I have just finished The end of time special and I have some questions that I am confused about.

Who was the woman that was talked to Wilfred throughout the special? She was one of the angels at the end behind the president time lord and the Doctor never told Wilfred who she was when he asked.

Also,this is a dull question but what did the Doctor mean when he said he once borrowed some money from a bloke named Jeffrey (Geoffrey?) Noble? 

Did the Master die?

Why did the Doctor go back in time and visit all of his companions? 
He visited Martha and Mickey but they were battling Sontarans so were they in the future? And also he visited Sarah Jane Smith (or rather her son) and this is also a stupid question but I though that she as dead due to the Daleks? Or did he travel back in time? Or did Sarah Jane Smith not die and I just missed a lot?

And my final question, what is up with the Oods? Why was there an Ood at the end saying that he will sing the Doctor a song and something about the story ending but the song lives on?

That's partially down to the inexperience of the full-backs, partially down to poor shielding from the midfield and partially down to the slowness of Carra and Coates, but it's also down to the way the CB's played it.

Coates (and Carra, but to a slightly lesser extent) is too *reactive* a defender, he says ""I'll stop you"" whereas Skagger's attitude is ""Fuck you, we're not even going to let you try."" Everyone focuses on the passing game, but pressing when we don't have the ball is just as important a means to an end as passing, and that goes for our defenders as much as anyone else. Robinson, Flanagan et al can be forgiven to some extent, but the central defenders *have* to shut attacks down before they get to the box. Granted, plenty of Mansfield's attacks came from set-pieces and the attitude and energy they showed in the second half would have put pressure on many defences, but the reactive nature of our back 4 allowed it to continue, and meant we'd win the ball in our own box and have very few options further up the pitch to send it to.

Coates, in some ways, seems like an ideal Rodgers defender, but in terms of his aggression from the back, is completely wrong. He's actually more suited to Benitez or Houllier , but that's another conversation; Rodgers needs defenders who'll win the ball further up the pitch, and at the moment he doesn't do that. Hopefully he'll learn, but today did a lot to win me over to Rodgers' side on this one. I don't want us to sell Seb yet because I believe he'll turn into a very good defender, but he'll have to go somewhere where he can improve his reading, aggression and ball-winning further up the pitch before he can become an option Rodgers wants to keep.

This is something I don't understand. Of course there is history. But I think the british really hate France. For instance, in France, it's not like we love the UK but we don't spend our time hating. But the british seem to really have HATRED for France.

For instance :

""France is the danger of Europe""

http://www.francetvinfo.fr/image/74rige9y9-34f5/570/745/1034177.jpg

""What France needs, France in Denial""

""France faces the future""

Because France wasn't retarded enough to send their men to die like dogs  :

Sounds vague, and probably shit. But it isn't, it's alright, and with proper development and funding it will be incredible.

You can watch the original series on YouTube to get a flavour of the characters and setup of the show. The pilot will pick up where this left off. Please have a watch and if you like, share or even donate to our Kickstarter to help fund the pilot.

We are just a young group of lads trying to get things going as we have a real opportunity with a major production company and we are very close to being legit.

Over the past few days it has become quite tedious to see every link mentioning Lampard posted and taken as gospel, regardless of their often wildly contradictory contents. I shan't be discussing the probability of Lampard (or Terry/Cole for that matter) being re-signed to a new deal. As many of you know I am privy to more information than most but there is no need to be a 'Chatty Cathy', I'd like to think that I've never steered you wrong though

On to business, let us begin with Frank Lampard. I wrote a detailed response the other day to a thread in /r/soccer [(found here)](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/15wtov/frank_lampards_agent_confirms_summer_exit_from/c7qka5b) regarding the situation as it stands. I get the impression many of you aren't totally familiar with the history behind this current impasse. We should begin roughly 4 years ago, as Jose Mourinho took charge at Inter Milan. At this stage, Lampard was at his peak and was continuing to set the example by which other midfielders were measured. His salary at the time was generous even relatively speaking but he wanted more. Through a series of media rumblings, 'quotes' and vague allusions made by both Frank and his agent, Steve Kutner, it became obvious that he was holding the threat of a move to Inter Milan over the head of the club. This situation resolved itself by a bumper deal for Frank taking his salary to £150k a week and the top of the Chelsea pay scale. Frank also lead the anti-AVB theatrics that plagued his reign. Whether one agrees or disagrees with AVB's methods, he was shown a complete lack of respect by Lampard and others which made his position untenable. A small detail for most fans but a terminal error in the eyes of the hierarchy of the club. Twice now he has essentially held the club to ransom, once to increase his salary and the other time to guarantee his standing at the club. These transgressions have not been forgotten, or forgiven and are seen as a dangerous symptom of the oft-mentioned player power that has been present at the club since Abramovich took charge. Unless something extraordinary comes to pass, the stance of the club is to no longer indulge the whims of the players, regardless of reputation or past glories. This is to say nothing of Frank's demands (I can't believe people took the £100k pay cut nonsense as truth) or the club's future plans with regards to a pay structure. Locking up £15m over two years on a 35 year old midfielder is terrible business, and before anyone cites Ryan Giggs or Paul Scholes do bear in mind that both of them took rolling deals at massively reduced pay to help out United when required, not start every game. They made their feelings clear and declared they would serve whatever role was needed until Fergie could do without them, respect is due for that

There is a lot more I could say about Lampard but I shall refrain. His agent and him have tried to work and angle and the club has basically called their bluff. If anything, it is the duo that is souring what is probably his last few months at the club, unlike Didier. I cite him as an example of the complete opposite, a man who served with unquestionable loyalty. I told you all here that he was leaving before it was announced, we had that discussion. However you should all know that had we not won the Champions League, he would have stayed on a rolling deal to 'do a Giggs/Scholes'. He left with everyone's blessings and reputation larger than ever, aided in no small part by the fairytale ending with his last kick of the ball for Chelsea. He knew when it could get no better and knowing when to walk away is an underrated aspect of a footballer's career and how we perceive it later on. All this negativity about the club is being fed to a voracious media from Frank's management and to be honest it leaves a sour taste in the mouth. The same media who slated us for having old players on big money are now demanding we give whatever it takes to keep a 35 year old until he's 37. Hypocrisy that should be admired for it's bravado

John Terry also pulled a 'Lampard' some time ago. He wanted a pay increase and threatened a move to City to get it, the same exact thing Wayne Rooney did. Now, he never came out and said he wanted to move but just like Rooney he kept silent and let the agents put the stories out there to pressurise his current club. He never went so far as putting in a transfer request but the intention was obvious. Again, the club relented and bowed to his demands but his card was marked. His situation has been dealt more blows after the Wayne Bridge/Vanessa Perroncal incident and the Anton Ferdinand case. He is now seen as a hinderance in terms of reputation to the club and is no longer untouchable as he was for so many years. He has another 18 months to go on his deal, do not expect him to be playing for Chelsea after that

Ashley Cole is the one that I disagree with (most), currently there is no replacement available in the marketplace nor is Ryan Bertrand anywhere close to his ability, attacking or defensively. I believe the issue here is down to length of contract and Ashley's desire to try his hand abroad. We can't do much about that, if Cole has said that he doesn't want a new deal then there is no point negotiating. I would love to see him stay though, more so than Lampard he is a crucial part of our team

I've waffled on long enough here, you can all believe whatever you wish, of course. This is the transition period that has been coming for some time, out go the ageing superstars on huge pay deals and in come younger, hungrier players on half the salary and who have resale value (Torres aside). Cole, Lampard and Terry earn a combined £450k roughly, over £20m a year in combined renumeration. The club feels the money could be better spent elsewhere while achieving a long standing aim of removing the power base of the players and allowing for a more stable management structure. I expect Benitez to oversee the dirty work as the fans dislike him anyway and he is due to leave in the Summer, a new manager can come in with almost a clean slate and shape the future

Apologies for the length.
My girlfriend works for an insurance broker as a HR Manager, dealing with recruitment, payroll, some light accounting and staff training. The place she works is a fairly small business, run and owned by a guy with no prior management experience or training. His friend owns an identical (but larger, more successful) company and gives him a corner of the office rent-free to ""copy"" his model. 
This guy has previously been writing himself cheques to cash from the business, using the business account to pay for things like his Dad's house insurance, lots of things like that. He's recently stopped after his accountant told him it was illegal, though he ignored my GF when she said the same. 
The business itself is mostly a call centre of around 12 employees, very high attrition rate and staff turnover due to the low pay, tedious work and horrible working conditions. There is one person assigned as a ""Team Leader"" that also works on the phones. The boss regularly (read: daily) shouts abuse at the staff, swearing, threatening, throwing things against walls, being physically intimidating (he's a big guy), firing people on the spot if they ""answer back"". He doesn't enforce any kind of disciplinary procedure or grievance process. 
There have been a few times where he has shouted abuse at my GF, swiped things off her desk onto the floor etc, then come back later and apologised for his behaviour. It's well-known throughout the office that he uses steroids to build mass, which a lot of people blam for his temper. 
Recently, he took time off over the Christmas period and is due back in a few days. In the meantime, my GF and the ""Team Leader"" have been left in charge of the office, leaving her working longer hours than she is paid for, often at short notice. The staff there (in many cases, unskilled and with behavioural issues) are so dejected due to the working conditions and in lieu of the ""Boss"" being around, are acting up and any attempts by my GF or her colleague to get the team working have fallen on deaf ears, having them ignored or flat out laughed at. The boss called my GF and her colleague this morning and spent around half an hour hurling abuse, calling them ""fucking useless"" and blaming her for the team's poor performance whilst he's been away. 
My question is this: bearing in mind my GF's job description (HR and recruitment) and her existing workload, what should we do about any ongoing harrassment or impending disciplinary action? It's not her job to manage the team, although she has been trying to help in her boss' absence, but she has no management experience. I see it as like shouting at the window cleaner because your carpet is dirty. 

It goes without saying that she is looking for another job, but we don't know how long that will take, and in the meantime she comes home close to tears because of how she's treated. Is this legal? What advice can you give to someone in her position? Is there any external body that can handle such an issue, bearing in mind she is the ""HR department""? I feel so angry about how she's being treated and would like to handle it legally.

Thanks in advance!

Celtic have renewed their interest in Portuguese winger Helder Barbosa, who first appeared on the club’s radar in 2010, ahead of the Parkhead side’s Champions League qualifier with Braga. The 25-year-old was the subject of interest from Celtic in the last transfer window, and could be the answer to Neil Lennon’s wish for a left-sided attacker.

Barbosa’s agent, Angelo Martins, confirmed the interest from the SPL champions, describing it as ‘stronger than before.’ The former Porto winger is into the last six months of his contract with the Portuguese side, and a move could be more of a possibility as Barbosa has found first-team opportunities hard to come by this term, making just eight starts, with six substitute appearances. It is thought Celtic may attempt to bring the midfielder in on a loan deal, but Braga may accept a cut-price fee.

Celtic are also rumoured to be tracking Nigerian pair Juwon Oshinawa, of Israeli side FC Ashdod and Uwa Echiejile, a team mate of Barbosa’s at Braga valued at around £2.5 million. Chief scout John Park has been tasked with sourcing left-sided players, and both Oshinawa and Echiejile could fit the bill.

Kayal waits for Norwich decision

Celtic midfielder Beram Kayal is reportedly waiting for Norwich City to make a decision on whether they want to bring the Israeli international to Carrow Road.

Those are the main rumors i can find that have gained some traction, and haven't just been reported by one site. In my opinion, obviously Hooper would be a dream transfer, but i can't see any reason why he would leave, he is in great form, and playing champions league football. Even if he did want to, Celtic would probably ask for ~10M, which would be stretching our budget to say the least.

I would love to see Toure come in, and think that out of those he is the most likely - With Hughton's penchant for relatively unknown foreign players (eg Tettey), and the fact that he does like french/french league players (eg. Tettey, Ben Arfa for Newcastle), as well as the fact that he would be fairly cheap, it certainly seems to make sense. I would bet on the striker we inevitably sign being someone completely new, who the papers haven't been going on about, like so many were during the summer - what do you guys think?

We do have Virgin cables coming into the flat, but don't want to pay subscription. I've heard a rumour that if we plug a Virgin box in, we can receive just the free-to-view channels?
Nothing obvious on the Virgin site about this (sorry if I've missed something obvious), I'm guessing they'd want to keep it quiet though...

If anyone knows anything more about this, or if any kind soul has a spare Virgin box for us to test out, that'd be fantastic! Happy to cover postage costs etc, obviously!

Still, if you don't know who Susan is, or what the Untempered Schism is, read no further.

I have heard many fans state that Susan Foreman is not a Time Lord, rather just a Gallifreyan. However, I've never seen any episode in which there is any distinction between the two. Any time the Doctor identifies his home planet he is recognized as a Time Lord, for example.

I know there have been books and other non-canon items that claimed she wasn't a Time Lord, but those, being non-canon, don't count. Even the official books can't be trusted as Russel Davies utterly destroyed the idea of genetic looms by showing the Master as a small child looking into the Untempered Schism. (One could argue that Davies blundered his way through canon (and scripts) during his run, but we are left with the canon he wrote). The implication is that Time Lords breed in the usual way, and it has been confirmed several times that the Doctor has had at least one child. So, in what canonical way can one support the position that Susan is not a Time Lord?

It is possible that she was simply a human that he adopted, but her use of telepathy suggests otherwise. Thoughts?",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Susan Foreman (Possible Spoilers),4,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/165fz6/susan_foreman_possible_spoilers/

I already have a design for it and have decided what materials to use (balsa wood), but I'd like some advice from any other artsy people here.

First of all, the doors. I would like them to open, but I'm not sure what the best way to do that is. The TARDIS I'll build will only be about as tall as the long side of a piece of paper, so I don't think that hinges will work very well - they'd be too large, I think. My other idea is to attach the doors using pins through the top and bottom and into one side of the door.

Secondly, the top light. I can't find any balsa wood dowels of the right size, so I'll have to carve a piece into a cylinder. However, the balsa wood I've been able to get isn't thick enough to use alone. Should I take a slightly small light, or glue two pieces together and have it probably be a little bit rougher?

Finally, painting. I don't have much wood to spare, so I want to ask before I get started building. It's normally better to paint before putting together, as that way you don't get extra paint on the sides and such. But I'm not sure how the wood glue will hold onto the acryllic paint I've got. Does anyone know how that will work?

Leeds United - Financial Analysis Update
Back in September 2012, we undertook a detailed review of the finances at Leeds United and made a number of comments and predictions. We can now revisit these in light of the latest accounts (to June 2012) that have been submitted, somewhat earlier than in previous years possibly due to greater efficiencies or perhaps because it means that further financial details regarding the takeover will not need to be disclosed until next year…

Headlines

- Group turnover decreased by 4% from £32.6m to £31.1m
- Gate receipts decreased by 10.6% from £12.7m to £11.3m
- Wages to turnover ratio increased from 51% to 57%
- Overall admin costs increased from £8.6m to £9.8m
- “Unknown” admin costs increased from £4.5m to £5.2m
- Shaun Harvey was paid £259k including pension payments and benefits
- Since administration, the club has spent £17.7m in cash on building works
- Yorkshire Radio, LU Pavilion, LU Media and Leeds City Holdings lost a combined £781k in 2011/12
- The combined losses of these companies now total £4.94m
- Yorkshire Radio and the Pavilion owe LUFC £3.7m; LUFC owes LCH and LU Media £600k
- Profits from player sales - £2.5m - were required to keep the club afloat
- Preference shares issued to Lutonville Holdings - apparently controlled by Ken Bates - incurred admin costs of £107k
- £4m was payable to Lutonville upon “change of control,” which occurred a year to the day after the £3.2m share issue
- Future income from two years of season tickets and five years of catering profits has been mortgaged
- Net debt increased by 297% - £3.89m - in 2011/12
- The new owners look set to inherit £19.4m worth of debt.

These accounts show the situation at Leeds United as at the end of June 2012 - the end of 2011/12 season, and the early days of takeover negotiations. The six months between this accounting period and GFH Capital’s takeover showed no alteration in the way the club was run under Ken Bates and Shaun Harvey, meaning that we can assume the trends shown in these accounts have continued in that time. It is clear by just looking around Elland Road on matchdays that gate receipts so far in 2012/13 must be even worse than for the same period in 2011/12, itself a 10% drop from the previous season.

Despite Ken Bates’s constant assurances that the club was being run “along proper business lines,” the accounts show that as the club made almost no effort to arrest the slide in attendances and consequent decreasing turnover, the only way the club could stay afloat was through player sales, loans, and eventually outside investment. The club now has potentially £19.4m of debt. The much heralded building works and off field improvements have so far cost the club nearly £18m, and yielded nothing by way of profit.

Despite this, Shaun Harvey still states in the directors’ report that “The growth on [sic] non-matchday revenue remains critical to our plans so the dependency of success on the field is reduced over a period of time.”

Given that the football side, by virtue of player transfers, has been required to keep the club afloat while the losses of the non-matchday side grow ever greater; and that non-matchday activities will need to earn around £20m to pay for the building works and the interest on loans associated with it before it can show a profit; that lack of investment on the pitch has brought us to a position where less than 20,000 people can be found to watch football at Elland Road; and that as a result gate receipts and turnover have taken a serious downturn; we remain totally convinced that Ken Bates and Shaun Harvey have had the wrong strategy for success at Leeds United.

Summary of Numbers
(Excluding Player Trading)


Rob Wilson’s Comments of 2011 accounts

In his independent assessment of the 2011 accounts, sports finance expert Rob Wilson commented that he would: “Expect to see investment in playing staff.” The 2012 accounts show that in reality LUFC made a net profit of £2.5m from player trading during 2011/12 and in cash terms received £3m from the transactions during the period.

Rob also advised that the club need to sell more tickets to attract better sponsorship, which could be achieved by investment in the team and improved relations with the fans. Perhaps the drop in gate receipts and commercial income in 2011/12, leading to an overall 4% drop in turnover, reflect the fact that none of this advice was taken by the management of the club during this period.

Turnover

Back in September 2012 we predicted a decrease of £2.5m in turnover from the 2011 numbers: this decrease was a prediction for the current season (to June 2013) rather than the 2012 accounting period covered here. We actually felt that the 2012 figure would be down by roughly £0.6m, so the larger £1.6m shortfall revealed in the 2012 accounts means that if anything our prediction for 2013 could be optimistic as crowds have fallen even further this season. Therefore, unless there is a dramatic turn-around in attendances during the remainder of this season, we still expect further bad news on the turnover for 2013 - although we now hold out some hope that the turn-around will happen under the new owners, with the offer of half season tickets a good start.

Wages to Turnover

This ratio has increased from 51% (in 2011) to 57% (in 2012), which is partially due to the £1.6m decrease in turnover, and partially due to the £1.3m increase in wages. In spite of this it will still remain one of the lowest ratios in the league.

The highest paid director – believed to be Shaun Harvey - was paid £226k, increased from £212k in 2011, with pension payments and benefits taking his remuneration up to £259k. As ever, “K W Bates did not receive any emoluments or benefits during the year,” meaning the remaining £86k of the total directors’ emoluments of £312k was split between Yvonne Allen and Peter Lorimer. As additional directors’ emoluments over and above Harvey’s only appeared on the accounts after Allen joined the board, we assume the majority of this was paid to her.

Other Costs

We commented in September that a 60% wages to turnover ratio was sustainable, which appears to contradict the current predicament as a 57% ratio has resulted in an operating loss (excluding player trading) of £2.2m. However, as we explained at the time, wages management was only part of the equation here and we can see that it appears that other costs have been allowed to get even more out of control by the previous management team.

Excluding wages, the other administrative costs of the business increased by 14% (£1.2m) from 2011 and now stand at £9.8m (£8.6m in 2011), on the reduced Turnover of £31.1m. We were of the belief that £8.6m was too high for administrative costs in 2011 and therefore still believe that, with better financial controls to keep administrative costs down, we could have posted a positive return for 2011/12 without resorting to player sales to cover these costs.

We cannot comment in too much detail on where we would make these cost savings as most of the exact costs are not disclosed to the public. An amount of £5.2m is “unknown” in the administrative costs for 2012 (up by £668k from £4.6m in 2011) – however, this figure will include any legal charges incurred by the club which, we are sure Shaun Harvey would agree, could be a significant area in which to find savings.

We can see that in profit terms the upgrading of facilities has impacted the bottom line by a further £325k (depreciation now stands at £1.2m in total for 2012) over the previous year, plus an additional £250k was paid for a 4 year option to purchase more land from Leeds City Council to further develop the East Stand. These areas could have provided further savings.

On top of that the cost of selling Preference Shares to Lutonville Holdings (a company that according to the accounts appears to be controlled by Ken Bates) was £107k, and additional accounting charges over and above the £53k last year of £59k were incurred in 2012 (taking the total paid to £112k in 2012 - £44k of this was directly related to Preference share monitoring).

Building Update

These latest accounts show that since administration the club has spent £17.7m in cash on “building future income that will benefit the club for years to come” (or buildings to you and I).

While we still await with great anticipation the cash delivery of this building strategy championed so often by Ken Bates, we can see that the club have received £8.4m in cash via net player trading (or selling the talent) to partially fund these buildings, with the remainder coming from the well publicised borrowing facilities (courtesy of Lutonville, Ticketus 2 LLP, Enterprise and whatever was left of the future Season Ticket sales cash).

We note in the Directors report that Shaun Harvey believes in Ken Bates’s investment strategy regarding the East Stand development, as he states that it “will deliver financial benefit to the club on both matchdays and non matchdays for years to come.” We would like Mr Harvey to expand on this statement and explain when he believes the investment will pay back the £17.7m already spent, plus the interest on the various loans, and the £800k premium and £151k expenses on the Preference Shares, all of which have been paid additionally in order to finance the building works. We are struggling to understand how or when the corporate facilities will generate the c£20m of additional income required to break-even.

Furthermore, we note that this strategy has seemingly been devised “so the dependency of success on the field is reduced over time,” which leaves us concerned that Ken Bates and Shaun Harvey did not share the fans’ desire to see us win every game and get back into the Premier League and Europe. It also leaves us wondering if football is in fact in the right business altogether for their aspirations?

We note that capital commitments have reduced from £6.5m in 2011 to just £132k, meaning that if no commitments have been made since this accounting period, GFH Capital are in a position to stop further development on the East Stand if they wish.

Cash

As we stated back in September, our belief was that the club needed to sell players, obtain further loans or seek outside investment (or a combination of all three) in order to continue as a going concern. The latest accounts support this statement in full as we can see that sale of players netted the club £3m in cash during the year, a further loan was taken out via Enterprise insurance for £1.5m and new investment has been found via GFH Capital!

Whether our cash problems are now solved remains to be seen but, based upon these accounts, we can see that GFHC have not inherited an easy situation and will need to invest cash of their own or the existing downwards trends will continue, in the short term at least.

The Group loans situation remains a cash drain on Leeds United, as the club is still owed a net amount of £3.1m from its sister companies, broken down as follows:

- Leeds United Centenary Pavilion Limited - £2.6m
- Yorkshire Radio Limited - £1.14m
- With Leeds United owing:
- Leeds City Holdings Limited - (£0.26m)
- Leeds United Media Limited – (£0.38m)

Debts
As GFH Capital look to complete their takeover we looked into the debt they will inherit from Ken Bates; given his pride in leaving us debt free the result was surprising. Assuming the new owners adopt a strategy that sees use promoted to the Premier League before the 2017/18 season the following debts will need to be settled:

- Preference Share payment to Lutonville £4.0m
- Ticketus 2 LLP Loan Repayment £2.3m
- Enterprise Loan repayment £1.7m
- Krato Loan Repayment £0.2m
- Payment to liquidators £4.8m
- Working Capital Shortfall £6.4mTOTAL DEBT £19.4m
In the five years since administration Ken Bates and Shaun Harvey have managed to accumulate debts amounting to around the same amount as those that put us into administration in the first place. We just hope that the creditors are more patient this time (and don’t include HMRC).

The preference share at £3.2m incurred £151k of additional administrative costs, with £4m payable to Lutonville Holdings upon “change of control” of the company. The accounts state that: “Significant influence is exerted over Lutonville Holdings Limited by virtue of its connection to Outro Limited which is wholly owned by Mr K W Bates.” These shares were issued to Lutonville exactly a year to the day before the “change of control” to GFH Capital and £4m is now payable to Lutonville; these accounts show that an injection of cash would be required to pay this.

The loan from Enterprise was taken at 7% interest in October 2012, with the takeover nearing completion. It seems strange that a loan could not be obtained from a bank at a better rate; or that GFH Capital were not willing to put more money in themselves, if they were confident of completing the takeover, in order to avoid this the large cost of this loan.

Overall net debt increased in 2011/12 by £3.89m, or 297%, from 2010/11. Future income from two years of season tickets sales, and five years of profits from catering, have been mortgaged to finance the running of the business.

Group Companies

The finances of the football club’s sister companies continue to be poor with losses for the year posted by all of them amounting to £781k - making the overall total losses of these companies £4.94m. This breaks down as follows:

- Yorkshire Radio Limited: £101k - taking their total losses to £1.66m
- Leeds United Centenary Pavilion Limited: £234k - taking their total losses to £431k
- Leeds United Media Limited: £23k - taking their total losses to £25k
- Leeds City Holdings Limited: £423k - taking their total losses to £2.83m
This period covered the second year of operation of the Pavilion, and its losses increased from £196k in 2011 to £234k in 2012. This does not include staff costs, as the accounts state the Pavilion has no employees.

While I don't want to see any of our players leave, I feel as if it would not be the end of the world and would open some excellent opportunities for the youth players. While I was impressed by Lopes against Watford, I don't think he is ready for the Premier League just yet. However I think Guidetti, Rekik, and Suarez should all get more of a chance in the first team. They all have immense talent and I think if given some responsibility they would step up to the plate. It just doesn't seem like Roberto is willing to give them a chance.

One of the things it apparently explained was ""why we insist on asking each other how we are even though it's clear we don't care about the answer"".


Except it references it without adding the actual answer, so after Googling just lead me back to the article, I thought I'd come here. Admittedly this might be a question more suited to Social or Language Historians, but maybe there are a few floating around.


Tl;dr -- Why is ""How are you?"" still such a common greeting when it's clear nobody ever cares about the answer?

Edit: To clarify, I understand the purpose of the phrase -- to serve as a greeting, a show of mutual respect, etc. What I'm really asking (apologies for an obviously poorly worded question) is **Why is ""How are you?"" *still* in use when it has been so clearly devalued as to mean effectively nothing?**

Does ""Hello"" not serve the same purpose?

Edit #2: I know I'm coming across as a misanthrope, which may or may not be the reality, but I think that mostly it's just that I didn't really think through what I wanted to say before posting. I really meant using ""How are you?"" in regards to people you don't know that well. Obviously, I want to know how people I actually know and like are.

Lloris is nowhere to be seen, but Sandro is guarding that area of the goal. He makes an attempt to clear the ball, but accidentally produces a thunderous kick right into the facking post, injuring himself severely. Ball goes into the back of the net. 1:2 Newcastle. 

Anyway, it's all good. In a splendid counter attack, which resulted in three of our players standing against one defender and the goalie, the ball gets to none other than Alessandro Del Piero, who place is it Henry-style at the far post. 2:2.

I decided, after watching more games on ESPN/online that I want Everton to be ""my team"". They don't seem to be the team that will win it every year, but a team that is competitive with any team in the league. I don't want to follow a team which simply buys players (I'm looking at you Man City), but rather a team with a good core. 

What I am asking, if you guys don't mind, is to help me learn the basics. I am ""researching them"", as in learning the history about the team, but what I need to know is more ""fan"" knowledge,  which player should I follow, who do I hate (not just teams but specific incidents with player?... such as Van Persie leaving Arsenal for Man U), things in that nature. Is there anything an Everton fan MUST know? 

Please, if someone can help me get started following Everton (not just by watching the games, because I have been doing that), I promise to never jump ship.  

EDIT: Thanks a ton for all the reply. Much knowledge has been gained from his post! One of the main reasons why I picked Everton (which was only reaffirmed from these posts) was Evertons general ""class"" of a culture. It seems as though Everton uses more smarts than money when it comes to success which is what I like. Finding diamonds in the ruff so to speak.

I'm researching various routes I can take next in my life and one potential option is to start a small plumbing company. There are a few reasons why this might be viable, including the fact that competition is very low for my area (from my research).

However I was wondering if there was any certification you HAD to get before you can start your own company. I've researched this quite a bit and I'm not 100% which ones are absolutely necessary and which are just certificates for useless things.

I am graduating this year from University and probably leaving with less life skills than when I joined. 

To help survive as a student I am freelancing as a photographer and videographer. Whilst this started small I have already secured quite a few jobs for 2013. 

I was wondering if anyone could fill me in on invoices, I have done my own but they are nothing special and essentially have my address, their address, what I have charged and how they can pay it (bank transfer). Is there anything else I should add? Does anyone know of any cheap/free online solutions to create and send out invoices and to keep everything in one place? 

In terms of Taxes can someone help me with what I need to keep etc.? So far during my working life I have yet to earn above the tax free allowance but with that becoming more of a reality I was wondering what I need to do. 

If there are any online tools or software that can help me keep on top of this then please do suggest it!

Half of the ratings are recorded automatically via statistics while the other half are alloted via site admins who can praise shite players of their team.

I then found out that the writers on whoscored write very detailed articles for some teams and players while completely neglecting others. Arsenal are one of them and so their players are getting the jump ratings. When an author is submitting an article for Cazorla, he will jump the rating even though the computer will be saying otherwise. 

So I'll get to the most hilarious thing I found out next by doing a comparison of the Chelsea squad rating vs Arsenal's rating. 

Here is the result I got :

- Top 2 players for Arsenal are rated Cazorla and Arteta. 

**Both of these players are rated higher than Mata, Hazard, Cahill, Cole, Cech, Oscar, heck every single player in the Chelsea squad.**

- Juan Mata is rated the highest Chelsea player with a very leniant score of 7.3 compared to Cazrola's 7.8 because of which he knocks Cristano Ronaldo out of the whoscored.com world 11 (wait, it gets even more hilarious). Juan Mata blows Cazorla out of the park for nearly every single statistic ranging from passing, offensive, defensive etc. He even has a 3x better record in Europe and details if I get into will take the entire text limit of this sub. In short another admin alloted rating to keep Cazorla on the front page of whoscored.com.

- Arteta is rated higher than Mata, Hazard, Oscar , Cech , Cole, Cahill.

**Lets face it, we would trade Arteta in a heart beat for any one of these players. Different player my arse, for someone who watches every single Arsenal and Chelsea match this is beyond hilarious**

BUT WAIT!! IT GETS EVEN BETTER

- Fernando Torres is rated Chelsea's third best player. This is of course the automative rating working. But what is this, Gibbs is rated better than Torres at 7.23. 

**Ladies and gentleman, Kieran Gibbs with 14 apps is currently better than every single player in the Chelsea squad bar Juan Mata and Eden Hazard. Who the fuck needs John Terry, Gary Cahill, Ivanovic, Cole when you can have Gibbs??. It is worth mentioning at this point that Ivanovic has 4 goals and 1 assist as a CB compared to the mystro Arteta with his 4 goals (pens) and 2 assists. I guess it might be because of Arsenal's superior defense??**

IT GETS EVEN BETTER!

- Theo Walcott. Rated above every single Chelsea player and barely loses to Eden Hazard by 0.04 of a rating. 

**Thats right ladies, Theo fucking Walcott is better than all our squad.**

Want me to stop? No I'll keep going

- Jack Wilshere is currently rated 7.11. 

**That is more than Ivanovic, Luiz, Cole, Terry, Cech, Oscar, Ramires, Lampard, Mikel, Moses and everyone else that comes within this package.**

- Next comes Diaby, rated at a hefty 7.07 

**Again better than Luiz, Cole, Terry, Cech, Oscar, Ramires, Lampard, Mikel, Moses and everyone else that comes within this package.**

- Next come Podolskil and Mertesacker both at 7.05.

**Again better than Luiz, Cole, Terry, Cech, Oscar, Ramires, Lampard, Mikel, Moses and everyone else that comes within this package.**

- And so comes Vermaelen. This brave defender gets a 6.94, thats bad you say? Thats better than

**Cech, Moses and many other players**

Did you know that Petr Cech is currently ranked at #14 in the Chelsea squad? The guy who has barely stepped a foot wrong and saved our arse while the rest of the team underperformed. Moses is rated at #16 and this is out of a squad of 26 which includes Piazon, Essien, Ake, Marin, Hilario, Meireles for gods sake.

Petr Cech is also rated exactly the same as their goal keeper. The amaingly incredible Champions League penalty shoot out winning Wojciech Szczesny, a shit head who wont get into the top 5 list of the league let alone be compared to Cech. 

So there you have it, the difference between admin alloted ratings while writing articles and automated rating. 

It is important to see where the cut off of automative voting starts for the Arsenal squad. From Vermaelen their automative voting takes over and after that all their players are rated below Chelsea's bottom lot. You still see Sagna contesting with Ramires and other such fuck uperys though.


Whoscored.com are a crap site. **They are provided stats by OPTASTATS and even if you are looking at stats to compare players you cannot take into account these abysmal ratings.**

Opta provides accurate stats which are then raped by Whoscored.com. So even to those people who like all these stats comparisons, you are an absolute joke for trusting these ratings. You should be taking the stats and comparing them depending on the player's position and role in the team. And if you are one of the rare Arsenal fans watching 90% games of Arsenal + a handful of Chelsea games you yourself would be laughing at this all and the over hype of your players.

Here is another example :

http://164.177.157.12/img/graphics/221.jpg

A comparison between Mata and Pienaar. Mata blows him out of the water in every category yet only gets a final rating advantage of 0.17. The difference between Mata and Cazorla's rating is a massive 0.49.

If you do the math then that means that if we assume that 

Juan Mata is statistically 2x the player that Pienaar is and compare the ratio difference to Cazorla's rating then that means that Cazorla would need to be statistically 5.76x the player Juan Mata is to get that big of a difference in his rating. Now he only beats Mata in a handful of meaningless stats which no one even bothers to record and are not even mentioned on whoscored itself, he also loses out on all the major ones which fans take into account so what is this shit head getting a rating for? 

He is just a shit, older, slower Juan Mata and that is what he will always be. This diver is so overhyped that Arse fans forget their own manager admitted Hazard being out of Arsenal's reach so he had to settle for Cazorla. A cheap man's Hazard then perhaps? 

Now there is a team of the year going on at /r/Soccer, just wait and watch what happens on it and laugh some more.

Now, I personally do not believe that Clara will be directly related to Rose in any significant way, but I've recently started re-watching series 1 and I noticed a possible connection that I don't believe has been brought up yet. 

Ignoring *Rose*, Rose's first official adventure with the Doctor is *The End of the World*, which features an audience gathering to watch the destruction of a planet (in this case, Earth). The first time we meet Oswin is in *Asylum of the Daleks*, which once again features an audience (the Parliment of Daleks) watching the destruction of a planet (The Asylum). 

Rose's next adventure is *The Unquiet Dead*, which features the Doctor and Rose traveling to the Victorian era, and has them facing a threat (The Gelth) that impersonates the dead (by possessing their bodies). The next time we see Clara/Oswin is during *The Snowmen*, which again, takes place in the Victorian era, and features a threat (the Great Intelligence) that at one point impersonates the dead (the first Governess). 

Finally, based on the trailer for Series 7 part 2, it would appear that the next instance of Clara that we will see will be in contemporary London. Rose's third adventure with the Doctor was *Aliens of London*, which takes Rose and the Doctor back to modern times. 

Again, I don't think they two will be directly related, but I do think it's interesting that Clara/Oswin's interactions with the Doctor so far can be argued to possibly mirror Rose's first three adventures as the Doctor's companion.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"Subtle Rose/Clara connection?

Frank McParland is Liverpool’s Director of Academy and Player Development. He is based at their academy in Kirkby, outside Liverpool, and has been with the club for nearly 20 years. McParland liaises with technical director Rodolfo Borrell and reserves coach Alex Inglethorpe as they target new recruits and assess which players are ready to move up through the ranks in the hope of impressing manager Brendan Rodgers

People often ask what makes a Liverpool player? Talent and ability is the obvious first point of attraction but we want a winning mentality, a strong character. Someone who puts their personality on a game.

Andre Wisdom has personality, Raheem Sterling has it - you know he is on the pitch. We heard about him when he was 14 and on the bench at QPR and even saw him on Soccer AM doing the Skills School, where he was brilliant.

We watched him in the England U15s set up, put the intelligence together and knew he was for us. We study players from the age of five. At that age you are looking for someone who stands out in terms of co-ordination, maybe he is very quick or very athletic. We invite mini clubs to come in so it also creates a feelgood factor with strong community spirit. The local clubs feel an affiliation with us.

Five-year-olds often all chase the ball together so we break that up and give them little training exercises. Even at five we are looking to see if they can play with right and left feet. 

Some may just be good at every sport they try. Raheem, for example, is also great at table tennis and that can give you an indication. We'll keep inviting different groups in of five, six, seven and eight-year-olds, inviting some back, and we go through thousands of players. Everton and Manchester United do the same. If you don't do it then when it comes to the time you can sign a player, at nine, you won't know who the best ones are and they could sign for other clubs.

The manager Brendan Rodgers and I have a regular monthly meeting and we speak three or four times a week. I always make sure I call him 'the boss'. It sets an example for the lads to follow and it’s something I’ve always done with Roy Evans, Gerard Houllier, Rafa Benitez, Roy Hodgson and Kenny Dalglish. 

To be manager of Liverpool Football Club is a massive role with huge responsibility and that should be reflected with respect. He is the boss and that's how players and staff should address him. The manager gives fantastic support to the young players, that’s evident with who has figured in the first team this season. We've had six academy players involved this season not including Raheem as he was involved last year.

If I want a player the manager and I go over it. He asks how he will fit in, watches a DVD of the player and then if we pursue it will spend an hour with the parents and with the boy. Young players at Liverpool are treated as one of our family, one of our own. We are their surrogate family if you like and it’s important we educate them, not just in football but in life.
Gone are the days when apprentices were cleaning boots or toilets and baths but there was an important side to those chores.

We make sure our lads visit Alder Hey Children’s Hospital not just at Christmas but monthly. We want them to empathise with the young children there and realise just how lucky they are to have the life they have. While we there, one of the organisers said that Conor Coady, one of our England U19 internationals, was one of the nicest people they have ever had visit the hospital because of how he helped out, got involved. That gives us a sense of pride that we are doing the right things.

We send the lads to the Liverpool Homeless shelters also to help out, not in their tracksuits; in their civvies. We don’t want anyone thinking they are anything other than normal teenagers. Some of the things we do, your average fan would laugh at. We have to teach the foreign lads how to shop, how to iron a shirt, work a washing machine. We even give them a small car maintenance course so they can change a tyre or spark plug.

We had one funny moment when one of the German lads came in and queried his wage slip. He said: 'Excuse me but I want to opt out of this tax thing. I have looked at may wage slip and they are taking too much money off me!' We had to point out that was a way of life here, sadly.

Generally, we're helping them grow up, train them for life. We don’t just want good footballers we want good, rounded men. As footballers’ careers improve they have to do less and less in life but if they don’t progress they need to know how to cope in the big wide world.

We are aware of people’s perceptions and the trappings for young players with money. We always tell them to make sure their first car is a small one and we bring the police in to talk to them about safe driving. Sadly, we’ve heard of it so many times of kids in cars speeding and getting involved in accidents. 

It happens so we have to make sure our lads get the right message. Phil Roscoe and Clive Cook do an unbelievable job looking after this aspect of their education.Before last night's NextGen Series game against Inter Milan - which we won 4-1, the lads put in a marvellous performance to go through to the knockout stages - we had a friendly match on Saturday morning at Kirkby between our Under 18s and reserves. 

Marc Pelosi, a German-born American left-sided midfield player who has been with us for about a year, and our Hungarian striker Krisztian Adorjan both did well. Rodolfo Borrell, who is very hands on, myself and Alex Inglethorpe had a discussion and both will play at St Helens on Tuesday.

The NextGen Series has been fantastic for us. The lads experience what it is like to go to the next level. You are travelling across Europe like the first team do. Spending time at airports, on planes, in hotels, coping with the downtime, playing top European teams such as Sporting Lisbon. It’s a brilliant learning curve. Even in the games you have different referees and formations to adjust to. For the likes of myself it allowed us to scout one or two players too.

One that was outstanding last year was Joao Texeira at Sporting. We knew when we saw him he was one for us and when we got the chance to sign him the manager backed me and we spent a considerable sum on him. The trouble was when we got to the medical his back was in a seriously bad way. We questioned going ahead with it but he was worth the risk. He was put in a back brace for six months and after some fantastic work by the physios he is starting to play again. He is going to be a top, top player.

The scale of this club was brought home to the players when we went to Singapore prior to Christmas. The support Liverpool has in the Far East is amazing. We took our U19s yet there were thousands at the airport to greet us. They even had banners with Adam Morgan's name on them. We played in a tournament and it was beamed on TV to 50 countries. You could see it was difficult for some of the lads to comprehend but it's all part of the education.

He demands energy, passion, pressing, passing and link-up play from his forwards. The attacking potential that is being lined up at the club is exciting. Just have a look at the options for the front 3 we currently have:

Sterling-Suarez-Sturridge

Sterling-Sturridge-Suarez

Sterling-Borini-Sturridge

Sterling-Borini-Suarez

Sterling-Suarez-Assaidi

Assaidi-Borini-Sturridge

Assaidi-Suarez-Sturridge 

Assaidi-Borini-Suarez

On top of that, we are chasing Tom Ince and Nathan Redmond. So arbitrarily plug either of those (or any other winger we're linked with) into either of the winger positions. Furthermore, Suarez has the capability to play the #10 role (IMO) and free up all 3 forward positions for Sterling, Sturridge, Assaidi and Ince/Redmond/whoever to compete for. 

The really exciting part is the fluidity LFC will have. Suarez, Sterling, Sturridge and Borini have all demonstrated that they are capable of playing any of the front 3 positions. We most recently saw it in our league match against Sunderland: Suarez dropped deep to receive the ball, Sterling made a run through the center, Suarez lifted it over the defence and Sterling finished with a casual lob. What this offers the squad is unlimited potential and versatility when it comes to selecting an XI or breaking down a defence. Of course there are certain limitations - Sterling's finishing capability, Borini's inability to beat a man 1v1 on the wing, Borini's lack of pure pace, etc. 

I think our absolute best formation would resemble one of these situations:

Sterling-Sturridge-Suarez

Lucas-Gerrard-Allen

or

Sterling-Borini-Sturridge

Lucas-Suarez(#10)-Gerrard

or

Sterling-Sturridge-Assaidi/Ince/Redmond

Lucas-Suarez(#10)-Gerrard

A bunch of people have asked about a Suarez, Borini, Sturridge combination. I feel this lineup obviously has a bit of potential and Rodgers will eventually experiment with it. What I like about having Sterling/Assaidi and Sturridge up top together is their pace. It allows the pitch to be stretched both horizontally and vertically. Also, I don't fancy Borini on the wing at all. Unless he drastically improves, he will never be a good wide player. That's the only reason I don't have a Sturridge, Borini, Suarez option in my post. That front 3 will force either Sturridge or Borini out of their ""natural"" position. The only example where I have them both in the squad is with Assaidi alongside them. That was more of a cup option than anything.

I imagine this wont get too much interest here, but let's see!

My 5 year old brother was born with Cerebral Palsy, and is now booked in for an operation in the USA in March.
We have done lots of fundraising, and have hit our initial target, which will cover the cost of the operation itself. More will be required for extensive physiotherapy, and potential additional operations.

So as a final fundraiser (and a celebration of where we have got to so far) we are holding a Fundraising Ball at The Majestic Hotel next month - the date is the 9th February.

Tickets are £30 per person, and this includes a 3 course dinner, along with a live band, dancing etc and then a charity auction and raffle.

Its a chance to get smartened up and have an awesome night!

Tickets are available now, and (to be 100% honest) we are struggling to sell all of the tickets. So it would be great if you (plus partners, friends, family etc) could all come along!

We've got a Facebook page here:
https://www.facebook.com/FindingFrasersFeetAppeal?fref=ts

And a JustGiving here:

Please get in touch if you have any questions or would like to buy tickets!
Thankyou!

(or is it something else? :p)

I'll start at the University of Sussex on the 21st and since I am new to the UK, I'm an exchange student from the Netherlands, and new to Brighton I need some advice. I might edit this some times if I come up with new questions and you all are free to give advice as you please.

My first question is really simple, what mobile phone provider is the best bang for pound? And what kind of places sell the sim cards of these providers? For instance, in the Netherlands I think I can buy sim cards at the supermarket, is this also the case in the UK? If not, where do I get one?    A bit related, where is the nearest supermarket? :p

My second question is about food. My brother will bring me by car, via the Eurotunnel, and will go home after a few days. However, what are some nice, cheap places we could enjoy a meal? 

Thirdly, how do the buses work? :$ In the Netherlands we recently implemented a system where you get a card, put money on that, and you can basically pay with that card for every single type of public transport. Is there such a card as well in the UK? I saw on buses.co.uk something about it, but it seems more something of a 3 month kind of deal. If anyone could elaborate on that, I'd appreciate it.

My last question so far is about gyms. Is the gym at the university of Sussex any good? Or do you guys recommend others? I am planning to stay in shape while being here and I dont mind looking around a few gyms to pick the best ones.

O and, what are some fun things to do/see while in Brighton? I've seen suggestions about the seaside and the wheel, any other fun stuff?

I also noticed on the buses.co.uk that there was a journey planner, thats great. However, which way do I need to get into the city of Brighton?

Getting a bit confused by the cheapest way to get a train to London (from Warrington - staying with relatives). 2 adults 2 kids, we would also like to use a tour bus service and go on the London eye. 

The trainline.com website is a bit confusing to me, basically I want to go in the morning on friday and come back on the saturday in the afternoon or evening. What is the best way of finding the cheapest tickets to do so. Also, where am I best booking tickets for the London eye and can anybody recommend a good tour bus service?

Sorry I did try honestly but I'm totally knackered now! Can you Brits help me out? :D

New Show Synopsis: 
Captains Jack Harkness and Malcom Reynolds wake up with amnesia in the cockpit of a ship, run by a sassy computer named B.U.B.S. (voiced by Donald Glover of COMMUNITY). They fly around the universe solving space crimes, and trying to uncover the truth of who put them there-and why-while also discovering their love for each other. It's Memento-meets-Sherlock-meets-Love Boat.

Name:
Oh Captain, My Captain

To be fair, they do state they have no affiliation to the DVLA and there is nothing illegal about what they do. That is why the most the DVLA can do is post a message that disassociates itself from it [here](http://www.dft.gov.uk/dvla/). Their list of services they provide vs what they say the DVLA **don't** is quite misleading though:

* Comprehensive application review and verification service - application checked for mistakes or omission

*The DVLA do this too.*

* Forms printed with your details and posted to you directly

*The DVLA do this when certain licences are due to expire. For other types of application this can be accomplished with a pen and a spare 5 minutes.*

* Customer support by phone, live chat and email

*The DVLA do this too.*

If they actually checked the forms thoroughly for people that'd be one thing but things get missed and the DVLA are returning the forms to applicants anyway, something that they'd do in the first place! Again, to be fair, their [disclaimer](https://drivinglicence.uk.com/disclaimer.php) states they're not promising they'll do anything right or that their information is accurate and up to date.

The problem lies in the fact the former gives condition damage but nothing towards traps, and the latter gives towards traps and not condition damage.

What I'm asking, generally towards rangers of the same style of gameplay I've adapted, what would the best trait spread be for this style of gameplay?

What can we do?

Another game, another horrid Torres performance. I've been hoping we'd sign two strikers in this window and offload Studge and Nando. Still got a few weeks left--everyone at the club must admit it's time. In 100~ minutes Demba Ba has shown what this team looks like with a real striker and it's immeasurably better than they look with Torres. 

We don't need Cavani or Falcao, just get someone to spot Ba some time (perhaps Schurrle who could play other positions as well or Remy, who I like but hasn't played much this season) and ship Torres on. Loan him to Atleti or QPR for all I care. Send him to America. 

I am so incredibly tired of watching his desperate, aimless and usually useless performances that I don't even care who we get, I just don't want to see THIS anymore.

As a Protestant I'm embarrassed by the way the Loyalists thought that setting fire to things and rioting is the way to get what you want. Like children throwing a tantrum.

As a Nationalist, would you have a problem with both flags being flown over the City Hall? Would you be so juvenile that you would be ""offended"" by a Union Jack? The Union Jack is flown Down in the South ffs.

**EDIT: Some Great responses here. Keep them coming.**

This post is just to clarify that there will be only **ONE** change to the rules, which will be highlighted in bold below:

-32 Entrants, all games before the quarter finals are best of 1, Quarter finals and onwards become best of 3.

-For the best of 3 format, with the final game being select hero vs select hero **both players can now pick the same hero**, just bare in mind that the selections are secret until the game starts, so players will not be able to do it purposefully.

-All games will be broadcasted by myself solo or myself with Rime, no games will run consecutively.

From the begginning of season 4, we saw the Doctor struggling with the concept of fate and time travel. In the first episode there was this big dillema about whether or not he could save Pompeia. On a similar level, in episode ""water of mars"" he fights with the same dillema and there is a change of attitude and decides to play-god and change the route of history but he seems to regret it later.

Now, in the end of ""The end of time"" we can see the Doctor hitting o Sontaran right before he was going to shoot at Martha and Mickey, and on exactly the next scene saving Sarah's son from being hit by a car.

What I believe, is he didn't appear at exact those two minutes at the right at the place time, just by coincedence but because knew what was going to happen. I think that he want to the future and he found out that Martha and Mickey were going to die at this day, at this place by a Sontaran and he decided to give them a second chance and change the route of history as a final departin gift. Exactly the same happened with Sarah's son.

Anyway. These are my thoughts. I am open to discussion.
