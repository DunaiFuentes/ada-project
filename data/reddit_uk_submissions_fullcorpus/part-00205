________________________________________________________________________

10 minutes hearts come down the left of Falkirk twice in a minute, the first shot by Hassanaoui saved and cleared before it comes back into Bauben who shows good feet but gets into the 6 yard box but hits the sidenetting.

15 minutes good possession and interplay by hearts but Falkirk stand firm. Hearts look to move the ball side to side but hearts put it out with a wayward pass.


19 minutes hearts win the ball high up the park through King who is fouled chance to get a free kick into the box. The ball is deflected behind for a corner. The corner is badly overhit and ends up going out on the far side.


22 Hearts dominating possession and playing slick passes in the middle third while under no pressure from Falkirk. They are finding it more difficult to repeat this further up the park. 

26 minutes GOAL HEARTS! McHattie 1-0

King and Buaben exchange passes, king bursts through the falkirk defence and slips a ball to McHattie up from left back on the overlap. McHattie drives it into the top corner.

29 Hearts are getting behind Falkirk now, this time through the right back who overlaps and bursts into the box, but his cut back is too close the ex hearts man MacDonald who gathers easily.

32 More good play from McHattie down the left who beats his man and puts a great ball into the box, which between goal keeper and defender falkirk manage to put behind for a corner.

37 GOAL HEARTS! El Hassnaoui  2-0
Great play by Walker who beats his man and gets to the byline. His cut back across the face of ball is begging to be turned and, and El Hassnaoui obliges with a simple finish.

39 minutes Falkirk look to respond, an attack down the Falkirk left is squeezed out, but falkirk recover the ball and a strike comes in from 30 yards out, but it is well wide.

40 minutes El Hasnoui is down off the ball holding his face.
Leahy and Ozturk booked after the usual handbags.
Looking at the replay it is an obvious and disgusting dive by El Hassnaoui . Runs into the Falkirk defender and falls down holding his face. Cynical and transparent attempt to get a fellow professional sent off for no reason.

The disgusting behaviour of El Hassnaoui has poisoned the atmosphere of the game. There is a spite and a bitterness in the exchanges, with tempers frayed on both sides. I hope El Hassnaoui can be retrospectively banned for that


45+2 Half time


45 2nd half kicks off

49 Double change for Falkirk, Cooper and Biabi for Smith and Grant

50 Good spell of Falkirk pressure, hearts unable to fully clear the ball from a cross from the left, Biabi the substitute is fouled on just outside the box. Free kick in a good position for falkirk. 

51 His fellow sub cooper takes it leftfooted. He gets it up and over the wall, keeps it on target, but it is a placed free kick without enought power to beat the keeper, and Alexander catches it and holds on well.

52 Alexander is closed down by Biabi inside his 6 yard box, but does a lovely, if risky bit of skill to get out of trouble.

54 Not to be out done Cooper gets the ball on the right and cuts in on his left foot for an inswinging shot, Alexander holds on. The tow subs have certainly added spark and appetite to the home side.

56 El Hassnaoui on the right of the box has two teammates in the middle to aim for, but his cross is well cut out.

58 Heavy tackle by Allston on Walker and he is rightly booked

61 a poor falkirk corner hits the first man Gomis, who bursts out to claim the loose ball, strongly blasting through a tackle before blatanlty clipping the legs of Cooper. He is booked and the free kick is a far better deliver, McCraken get his head to it, but can't direct it away from ALexander, who makes a comfortable save. He could perhaps have done better.

65 Falkirk well on top, heart can't get out of their own half for a good 3 minutes. Finally they break, and Shaughnessy takes one for the team by killing the break away with a foul on El Hassnaoui . Yellow card.
The free kcik comes to nothing, but a poor back pass puts Wakler clean through on goal. MacDonald makes the save 1-on-1, but it should be 3.

67 Sub hearts Keatings on,  Buaben off.

70 GOAL Falkirk Biabi.
The subs have added to falkirk's htreat no dount and it is Biabi who gets one back. Great play on the edge of the hearts box, and clever one tow touch move puts biabi in and he makes no mistake. 2-1

77 Yellow card Volks. A very heavy challenge trying to recover a ball he lost. The ref plays advantage, but Volks doe not escape. Booked at the next break in play.

81 Keatings has a chance to make the points safe for the jambos. The ball comes slightly behind him inside the box, but he has time to take a touch, set himself and pick his spot. But he puts it wide.

83  Falkirk have a free kick and are loading the box. Sheppard come son to replace Taiwo, perhaps to complicate the hearts marking. Hearts win the header and clear.

86 Walker is in the box bearing down on goal, he has 2 teammates in the box if he looks up, but he gets too greedy, comes to far, and loses the ball. It was a tap in if he puts the ball across goal, but he gave Falkirk a chance to recover and get a tackle in.

89 Free kick falkirk, great ball, flicked on Shaughnessy from 5 yards out gets onto the flick on and puts it over the bar! Sitter. Golden chance for 2-2, and he has wasted it.

90 3 minutes of injury time.

91 Hearts recover some composre, and get the foot on the ball. Thye pass and keep possesion and suddenly they've used up 1 out of 3 minutes with simple possession football.

93 Falkirk win a throw in level with the D They load the box, but it comes to nothing. Alexander gathers, and hearts eat up the seconds. They clear, and thats it.

3:04 In the K! First time in about ten years!

1:43: just left The Abbey. Now in CaVa!  Great to night.

12AM: now in Doctor Duncan! 

7:18 Now heading to Lady of Mann! 

6:55: will be five minutes late. Almost there!

5:45pm: I'll be wearing a red shirt, black leather jacket. I'm pretty easy to spot! We'll be waiting at the top of the escalator into Moorfields station. If you're going to be late, meet us in Lady of Mann. We'll be in there until at least 9pm. PM me for my mobile number if you'd like more info.

---

On 6th December, we're having our [seventeenth meetup](http://i.imgur.com/jbi7xJM.jpg). Fancy being a part of it?

We'll be waiting at Moorfields station just after you come out of the station and before you go down the escalator to the street ([At the top of here](http://i.imgur.com/gVuA3Yt.jpg)) and we usually wait there for around 15-20 minutes to allow anyone late to join us. From there, we head to Lady of Mann, which usually has enough seating to handle us all.

After that, check back on this post for updates.

**If you plan on getting there late and want to know where we are (or what we look like) send me a PM with your mobile number and I'll ~~send you cat facts~~ update you.**

I moved in a couple of days ago, I've got my name on a tenancy agreement from the new flat. I've also requested a copy of my birth certificate from the council where I was born and paid for that.

I'm less than 30 yo, I have some post bonds and between 10k and 20k EUR in a bank account in my home country, and I'm still receiving some passive income on it. My salary is around 28k~ GBP, but I expect it to sensibly increase in the next few years.

I'm currently spending &lt;500 GBP on rent (not sure how much I'm spending on food, I'll try to keep track and get an idea after the 1st month). I plan to save money: I don't need a car, and I don't even necessarily want a property for my own exclusive use (I'll just let a room if I'll get one). Also I might move again in the not too distant future (while working at the same company) and the job might require me to be abroad for weeks/months.

So, given my previous experience with a bank in my home country and my requirements, I'd like:

- A bank with a website that is not totally awful: I had an experience with a GWT (google web toolkit) bank site that wouldn't work at 2.00 or 3.00 AM (some weird nightly batch job blocked everything), had weird bugs forcing me to refill/resubmit forms and failed to generate printable pages (the print stylesheet was borked) on Chrome
- TOTP support (2 Factor Authentication, so that I could reuse the same mobile app I'm already using for other services)... it's not perfect, but I think it'd be more comfortable than the alternatives
- The Credit/Debit card they supply shouldn't force me to sign receipt to confirm the payment (as much as Chip&amp;PIN is insecure, I feel like writing my signature is even more so), and at the same time it should be relatively permissive, so when traveling abroad I woudln't risk getting my payments rejected (Ideally it'd be nice to be able to know in advance the CVM, Cardholder Verification Method used by their cards)

But aside from these details I have no clue about which kind of account (and supplied by which bank) would be best.

Near to where I'm living I have Barclays, Lloyds, Santander, Leeds, HSBC, NatWest, Handelsbanken and Halifax (not sure if other banks exist here in the UK, but having them at arm's length is kind of nice)

Any hints?

Thank you

PS: forgot to mention the bureacracy take on this... Later this month I'll have an interview to apply for my NI number, and for that I'd need a proof of residence.

[Before](http://i.imgur.com/sSmgF8X.jpg) and [after](http://imgur.com/a/T0p6A#2).

The after pictures are blurry (apologies - no camera but phone at school) but to give a better idea through description a-la-google:

My chin: [it has a lot of little tiny bumps like this girl has except in small patches from just under the side of my lip to the left of my chin just by my jaw. They look a bit like swollen sebaceous filaments](http://i614.photobucket.com/albums/tt223/brittanyfaith8182/myface222-1.jpg). I don't know what they are really and I can't find an answer :/

My forehead: probably the only pic that came out reasonably ok. [A bit like this google girl's forehead](http://i.imgur.com/bxDVKUr.jpg). Some rather flat red marks, some more bulbous pimples. These last for months and take a while to go away once I go back to London/wherever. The main thing I want to get rid of. Only happens around my T-zone.

My cheeks: these are a very strange mix between my chin and my forehead. Some pores seem to appear larger but when squeezed (I know I really shouldn't do that) the stuff that comes out isn't stringy like a normal sebaceous filament. It's thicker, yellow tinted and a bit more rectangular. The spots here are flatter as opposed to the slightly more bulbous ones on my forehead. Couldn't find a good pick for this.

Current routine 2-3x a week:
1) Wash face with just some water
2) put some mineral oil on my face. Rub it in for 1-2mins. Let it sit for around 2-3 mins. Wash off with water, wipe with clean towel/tissue. Repeat a 2nd time to get it all off.
3) put a medium layer of organic, unpasterised raw honey on my face. Build up slightly where I need it (T-zone, cheeks, chin). Leave on 45mins-1hour. Wash off with water.

The honey is generally pretty moisterising so I only use some (Lush Imperiaus facial moisteriser) if I feel I need it. I often do this routine before bed so no sunscreen. I try to remember sunscreen in the day though.

I wash my face with water in the morning and whenever I wash my hands, then dry with some clean tissue.

In London my skin was super dry but was extremely clear. I shower with medium temperature water out of habit because my face used to feel incredibly tight when I used hot water. Since getting here my skin feels less dry but a bit more oily (not qualifying as oily skin at all). I'm guessing it would be normal/combo but I'm not sure. My skin looks far better and less red afterwards but I can't get rid of the pimples.

The weather is about 10-20% more humid here and it's a bit sunnier.

Is there anything you guys would recommend that I'm not doing? Any thoughts on what my skin type is? I'd prefer to use natural exfoiliants if that is possible because chemicals feel a bit harsh on my skin at times but I'm open to trying new things.

**tl;dr:** moved to more humid part of England from London. Skin has been breaking out with pimples and other unknown things. Tried mineral oil+honey. Helps, but not a lot. Used to have dry skin, not sure anymore what kind.

I get the bus home on a regular basis. I live in the suburbs and the bus stop is on the otherside of the road from my close (although not truly directly opposite - the bus stop is slightly before). The road that the bus continues on is going up on a reasonably long hill and slowly bending to the right as it goes up and comes back down
     
My issue is somebody is repeatedly parking opposite the entrance to my close and directly past the bus stop. So if somebody is coming out of the close and turning left, the car is parked directly opposite them. Similarly the bus stops, and then has to drive on the other side of the road to pass   
     
My main concern is not legal action or that they are prosecuted but that they are practically begging for an accident to occur a few minutes away from my front door. They are parking opposite a junction, immediately after a bus stop  on a bend. I've tried to take pictures before but it is incredibly difficult to do so as I get in late and it is too dark to be able to see the scene fully. So does anybody have any suggestions?

I did everything correctly and played by the rules but people behind the desk would always twist my words to make it sound like I wasn't doing what I was doing, and would even become rude saying condescending things like ""What's so hard about that?"". But the thing is though, I needed the money, so I was patient for as long as I could.

I've been told about it ""You only have to put with some miserable grumpy twat for 10 minutes a fortnight"", but it's the constant fear of when they're going to give up and just sanction me for little to no reason because they're that desperate for points.

I tried going without, I tried applying for voluntary work, seeking an option to get me into the game and have a decent load of experience to put on my CV, but it feels like God is one step ahead of me and has decided to remove every useful volunteering (that's relevant) opportunity. And I've tried the volunteering websites, the only people who got back to never bothered to contact me again. And when working for free becomes as hard as getting a job, you know there's a fucking problem.

Anyway, I eventually signed back on, but it was a ball-ache, and my dad who's my appointee spend a bit of time with them too. I initially made the claim online, but I clearly said I wasn't free to be contacted the day I claimed or the day after, but they did phone me that day and then the day after, and when they left me a voice message this lady said in a really depressed mumbled tone something like ""We tried speaking to you twice and will take no further action"" along with the number to phone. That alone made me nervous about signing back on, she not only sounded like she was prepared to hang herself but what she said was kinda pushy, as if I was incompetent when I clearly said I was busy.

So I'm worried they're going to find some non-existent reason to sanction me before I even get my first payment. Universal Credit has apparently taken over the benefit system meaning they're monthly payments instead of fortnightly, is that true? If it is, then it's even more worrying because I'll have to mentally cry knowing I might end up doing 14 days of applying for jobs 35 hours a week and for them to go ""Argh shit, guys we'll get sanctioned ourselves if we don't sanction someone, I know, how about that guy with no self-confidence and low self-esteem, I'll pwn him.""",false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,null,null,self,"Signing back onto JSA, good idea?",2,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/2mf6da/signing_back_onto_jsa_good_idea/

Here's the story, I'm an American living and working in the UK. I live in a regular British suburban neighborhood with not a lot of crime besides occasional car break ins. Earlier tonight around 8 pm my wife and I are watching tv while she was feeding our newborns baby and I hear frantic knocking at our door. I have a friend who lives around the corner so I was thinking it might've been him coming to ask for a cigarette but the way the knocking was sounded fast and kind of weird. I go to the door, look through the peep hole and no one's there so I open the door and don't see anyone, then I look down and notice one of two pumpkins (not for Halloween but just Uncarved pumpkins for fall) we had by the door were gone.

I didn't think much of it and a few minutes later went upstairs to change my baby. While changing my baby I hear some commotion outside so I look out the window. There's a little neighborhood park across the street from my house and I see about 10 kids hanging out and smoking. I figure they were the ""pumpkin thieves"" so after I change my kid I spy on them out the window. I see one of them sneaking towards my house so I immediately go down the stairs and open my door and he's throwing the pumpkin in the middle of the road smashing it to bits. It was actually kind of funny but still. He sees me and immediately takes off. I tell the other kids to get the hell out of the park because I'm calling the police on them. A few of them get really mad about this and start calling me a ""fat american"" and on and on. I pull out my phone and tell them I'm calling the cops and they all start to split but not before one of them says ""well we'll be back to deal with you."" Or something along those lines.

Look, I know kids will be kids. When I was an idiot teenager I almost got arrested for throwing eggs at an italian resturant. Should I expect any retribution for threatening to call the cops on these punks? I'm not really worried but they seemed really really mad at me. Should I expect to have my tires slashed or a brick through my window tonight? I have terrible anxiety and now am still up worried I'm going to have to chase some kid down or call the cops. Should I expect anything or just say ""screw it"" and go to bed?

P.S. Sorry about the spelling/grammar my iPad froze like three times when I tried to write this and I'm a dumb american.

TL,DR: I'm an American living in the UK, some local kids were behaving badly and I threatened to call the cops on them and they vowed revenge.

Football has changed since the nasty football casual days. Rugby has a problem.
Also horse racing fans. Royal Ascot and the like. Drunk wankers. Plus its a cruel barbaric sport.

Anyway just my opinion. I don't just hate rich cunts. Cunts are cunts despite how much money they have.

I'm not as against Vlad as most, but he seems a fairly obvious choice, little playing time, unimpressive performances and we could still probably make up what we paid for him. 

Paulinho out because watching him makes me sad.

Lacazette is on fire, and young, to the point that I really can't see Lyon(?) selling him, it's optimistic.

Moreno because he impressed me in the WC and poch believes in him.

I will post pictures tomorrow, but basically the laptop I am offering is a 17"" Scan 3XS custom laptop with an i7-4700MQ, 780M graphics card, 8GB of RAM,2 750GB WD Black hard drives and a 17.3"" 1080p display. It is housed in a Clevo p170sm chassis.

As you can see here the cpu in this thing is amazing. It's better than a 4690k in passmark's benchmarks (http://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp[]=1923&amp;cmp[]=2284&amp;cmp[]=1782). This thing is brilliant for photo editing, which is what I used it for as well as gaming.

The 780m gpu performs near to a 760 desktop gpu in Fire Strike (http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-780M.88993.0.html), and as you can see here (www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-780m-770m-765m,3732-5.html) it can run Battlefield 4 at around 45 fps on ultra, 70fps on high.

Now onto the bad stuff :
- No Windows OS. I have wiped the hard drives and installed Ubuntu.

- Battery life - It actually isn't bad when you aren't gaming, I'd say 2.5 hours, but gaming maybe 30-40mins. But this is true of most gaming laptops anyway.

- Noisy - yes this thing is bloody noisy.

Pricing :

I'm willing to sell this thing quite cheap, bearing in mind that the gpu costs over £300 new (http://ebay.eu/1uqTMtp) and that the cpu costs from £120-160 depending on if you get it shipped from the us or here. Two refurb 750GB WD Scorpio Blacks are £40 each, and Vengeance 8GB RAM is about £60 new. So in total not including mobo, labour, case, power brick etc it's £560 new.

I think this would make a good thread of its own instead of being buried down here ... it's interesting that people are trying to reclaim the swastika and reconnect it with its ancient history :)*

She makes a good point. It piqued my interest and I googled 'hindu swastika.' I came across [this picture of a child with a bald head and it is tatooed on her scalp](http://www.dailytravelphotos.com/archive/2011/05/22/). Now, I'm all for expression of one's self through body art, dress, makeup and suchlike, but I do feel as though parading a young child around with no hair, who almost certainly has no choice in the matter to say 'this is my religion, this is who I am' is disrespectful to the child. I'm sure it was only a temporary thing and that of course her hair grew over it, and I am not naive enough not to understand that there are cultural and religious influences at play here, but fucking hell, THEY TATTOOED HER HEAD. I've never had a tat but I know it can be painful because I had my hand crushed to death when a friend had one on her upper arm (which was funny - she asked for and got a unicorn, but unfortunately strangers in pubs kept asking why she had the Lloyd's Bank horse tattoed on her arm), so what the chuffing fuck? Look how young she is.

In a similar vein, I'm sure there are still trainee child slavehouse geisha who have their toes broken in order to fit into the most ridiculously small shoes, and I don't agree with that tradition either. Beside apparently being more attractive to Asian men (at least, at the time - we're talking 1900s here), there are some nasty sexual deviances associated with this; I vaguely remember the details but feet horrify me so much that I don't care to recall them in full. Breaking people's bones for sexual kicks ain't high on my list of things to do though (unless it's an accident, in which case, oopsie). So this has turned into a bit of a rant about culture and aesthetics; sorry about that, but I will continue. 

I absolutely adore the henna decorated hands prior to and during Indian wedding ceremonies, and that's an aesthetic I can get behind. Yes, it lasts for an awfully long time, but it's neither permanent nor painful. 

I salute Saudi for finally allowing women to drive, but *not whilst wearing makeup* - you what? I don't leave the house without it. I assume that they believe their women are so vain that they'll cause car crashes through constant makeup checking in the mirror. Is there reliable data to confirm this? 

Many African tribes have traditionally had ear plugs and lip plates to signify status within the tribe; I have no issue with either, but fuck me, can you imagine the pain of accidentally falling asleep, rolling onto your side and catching your teeth on one of [these](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTuv29eKjQxpAyPn73-cKXZD2KaVDtXsn4frx6wDkvkqh851PcJ) mofos? Not very practical, are they? I'd get it caught on ALL the things and rip my lips off. 

Okay, it's late and I'm tired now, but I'd love to hear your views on different cultures, religions and their kooky (or sensible) aesthetic traditions. 

*I was disappointed to see several people question the reason for someone's faith in the sub here recently when they weren't asking for advice or a discussion about their beliefs. Some people find happiness in having faith or religion, and whilst I'm very much an athiest (which I can't spell at 2.30am, apparently), I don't think the pubreddit is the place to question things that make folks happy.

I would like to begin with saying that I am not a top of the class student. I am an above average or average student at the worst. With my major I will be entering the IT field and will be a data analyist here in the USA. I know that there is a pretty strong IT job field in the UK. 

Right now I am paying roughly $30,000 for my education including books, tuition, food, and housing. I know London is a very expensive city (and after living in Chicago, it sure as hell is too), but I am in love with the culture of this city. I have had friends go there and I have heard nothing but great things. Nothing is wrong with where I am staying now, but I have been wanting to sort of branch out and experience a new culture.

there is technology that has dimensions on the inside much larger than the outside.

Participants must have a delivery address in the UK.

We are using exactly the same method as last year, which worked very well - it might look a bit complicated if you haven't done this before, but I have given step by step instructions below - this method was designed so that each person only sends their address to one person, and not even the mods have a list of names and addresses.

Everyone who wants to participate posts a comment in this thread, then also sends a message to modmail with a secret password which they have made up ... after the closing date for the list, everyone is matched with a giftee and will be sent the username and secret password of that person ... then you register a disposable anonymous username and send a message directly to your giftee using their secret password, and the giftee sends you their name and address, then you choose a delightful gift for them and dispatch it by reindeer sleigh to arrive before Christmas.

The list of participants will be compiled here, and if you have any concerns about any of the participants knowing your address, you can message us and say please don't give [username] my password.

The general agreement is to spend between £5 and £10, but of course if you are fabulously wealthy you can spend more.

-----

I know this all looks slightly complicated, so please feel free to ask questions to clarify how it works, and here's a step by step instruction reference:

1) Post a comment in this thread to say that you wish to participate.

2) [Send a message to modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTheRedLion) to give us a secret santa password which you have made up.

3) After 28th November, we will send you the username and secret santa password of your Giftee.

4) Register a disposable anonymous username with reddit. Suggestion for username: something like RedLionSanta5376429

5) Using your anonymous username, send a private message to your Giftee with their secret santa password.

6) Your Giftee will send you their name and address.

7) Send delightful gift to Giftee.

I support a team called in the Conference South, life is good. We're finally picking up from a run of inconsistent form, all of our fans are in good spirits, chanting and bringing instruments to games. It's all good fun really.

However, our attendance still is pretty low, especially with a big team nearby. As a fan I'm trying my best to promote the club, but to have a real impact I'm considering having a chat with the club.


Q:

So Reddit, what are your thoughts on non-league football?

How would you encourage more people to come to your local team?

Any particular feedback I should bring to my local club to try and create more of an atmosphere?

How could your club make watching conference football a better experience?

I visited my GP a year ago and started off with BP, then after a few months of brief success I began noticing the effects were wearing off. He moved me on to Isotrex combined with BP; along with Antibiotics (name them all). 

Now after having brief success with both those regiments, and noticing the Isotrex left me with strange breakouts which I think were due to my skin being completely removed of all oil. I've been brought off Isotrex and BP, and been on Skinoren and Doxycyline 100mg for about 3 months. As an attempt by my GP to see if the more 'natural' cream/gel would be a less aggressive attempt at easing my acne.

I know Skinoren is less harsh due to the natural ingredients, but I have a lot of white heads, occasional cysts that hurt, bright red marks after spots have temporarily subsided still. Skinoren seemed to help for the first month but now it's winter (everyone here knows what damage UK winters can do for skin) and I'm constantly waking up to more and more red lumps and constant whiteheads which only makes my depression worse and makes me not want to go out of the house on weekends, thus causing more stress and depression.

I do not exfoliate anymore as I noticed when I was on Isotrex (isotretinoin) and when I did scrub off all oil my face would try to compensate by secreting even more few days after. Is this silly, should you always exfoliate, even just once a week or something, if you suffer from any kind of mild/severe acne?

I have a Ragdoll and a half Persian (4 and 5 years old) who I need to find forever homes for. I took on the cats when my brother and SIL emigrated to the UAE in July last year. We lived together in Stoke-on-Trent for 14 months and after a pretty shitty breakup, moving back in with my old man, and a job offer abroad, I've come to the realisation that moving them around the world with me isn't good for them, and that I need to find them forever homes with someone who will love them and give them the attention and affection they need and deserve.

http://www.preloved.co.uk/adverts/show/112047558/ragdoll-and-persian-need-a-nice-quiet-forever-home.html

&gt; ----
&gt; Oscar - White Ragdoll - ~4 years old. 
&gt; ----
&gt; Oscar is my boy. First off, we think the person who we had him off lied about his age, and he was actually a few weeks younger than what they said he was. The reason I bring this up, is because he still has some of the kitten traits and has not grew out of them (most namely suckling blankets/jumpers/bedding, etc).

&gt; I'm not 100% sure on the normal temperament of the Ragdolls, but I think him being taken away from his mom too young has affected him in a few peculiar ways. At the top of my head, one of the main things is that he actually acts like a dog. He begs, and has a very peculiar meow, which is almost a whine (and nothing like a traditional meow, I know ragdolls have a special meow, but his is different I swear). He's also been known to steal food, for instance the other night be broke into the margarine tub and had a good lick of the first few layers (so did the other cats).

&gt; Another trait of his, is that he only likes fuss on his terms (similar to most cats I guess), but he really has to be in the mood. If you stroke him when he doesn't want to be stroked, he'll give you a funny look and walk off. He'll then proceed to give you a death stare for disturbing him. Similar I guess to picking him up, he likes it, but only on his terms.

&gt; Having said all that, if you look at the pictures he's absolutely stunning. Whenever we go to the vets, all the nurses and vets fall in love with him. He likes being brushed for a few minutes, and then he has enough, he does however do a good job of keeping himself very kept and groomed. He doubles in size during the winter months (winter coat), and as a result does shed quiet a bit of fur, which brushing seems to help, but it's something that I need to use a lint/fur removing roll all the time.

&gt; He is extremely playful. He's sussed out the laser pointer (or he's just turned very lazy), but loves anything with cat nip in it. He rubs himself in it, and it looks like he tries to absorb it into his body. It really is funny to watch. He loves anything long and stringy and will play for hours. He also has a bit of a weird thing for long pieces of silicone, whenever we had building work done, he'd get a fold of it. He doesn't eat it or anything, just plays with it and flings it around, it's hilarious. He plays fetch, too. Which I guess for a cat is very weird.

&gt; In regards to his health, he has been de-fleed about 2 weeks ago, de-wormed about 3 months ago (will be doing this week or next). He's been microchipped, neutered, and has no other ailments or illness (that I'm aware of).

&gt; Both cats have had their first injections a few months ago however I was out of the country on business and was away for 3 weeks and when I go back it was too late for their 2nd injection, so I will get them done in the next week or two (the initial injection - I can then transfer the money to their new owners for their 2nd injections if necessary).

&gt; He is litter trained and has never had an accidents. He however does not understand how to cover his poo, and instead cleans/claws the side and the roof of the tray - Martini, the other cat, is known for getting sick of it, and will often go in after him and cover it up for him.

&gt; He's known for getting stuck in places. For instance, I've just moved back in with my dad and he manages to get on the garage roof by jumping on the fence, onto the gate, and from the gate to the garage. However, he's incapable of getting down, or backtrack his steps, so we have to do rescues every so often.

&gt;He really is a character, and needs someone who has the time, patience, and understanding that he deserves. He's such a lovely boy, and a great companion.

&gt; ----
&gt; Martini - Ginger/white half Persian - ~5 years old.
&gt; ----
&gt; Martini was the first cat my family got. We got her at a few months old, and she's grown into an absolutely beauty of a cat. She's an absolutely delight, and what Oscar lacks in affection to the owner, Martini certainly makes up for it. She sleeps with me every single night, and has been by my side through some really crappy times. She knows and actually cares (which I guess is weird for a cat), whereas Oscar doesn't so much. She's a great companion, and I'll definitely miss that.

&gt; Again, I'm not sure on the temperament or traits that Persians have, but Martini is a little diva. She will be outside for hours and will ignore your calls. Even when she's right in front of you, she'll out-right ignore you, just because. Once she's ready, she'll come in and be your best friend, like nothing has happened at all, even though you've been calling her for hours.

&gt; Martini, like Oscar, loves fuss, but only on her terms. However, her terms are pretty much all day/every day. She loves to be stroked, and petted, and could be scratched under her chin/ears for hours on end.

&gt; I think unlike full Persians she hasn't got such a squashed face where she looks funny, I think she's gorgeous with her half squashed face and wouldn't have her any other way.

&gt; She also doubles in size in the winter months, and also malts a fair bit. Brushing definitely helps, but some loose hairs still come off when you stroke her. A normal lint roller does the trick.

&gt; Martini is playful, but being the clan elder (as I like to call her) she's very much reserved and will only play when she's in the mood. However, when she does play, she does definitely play! She also loves the odd bit of catnip and goes wild with it. Long strings of fluff, or furry balls filled with cat nip, or mice, are her favourite.

&gt; In regards to her health, I understand ginger cats have problematic gums. She does have some black spots on her gums, but as far as I can tell, and from what the vets have said, she has good teeth and gums. I am however, keeping an eye on them as I know things like that can change really quickly. She doesn't have a problem eating both wet and dry food, so I'm assuming if she did have any gum/teeth issues, she'd be hesitant to eat the dry food. She has also been de-fleed, and had her first lot of injections which I'll start again this or next week. She has also been microchipped. The vet made a mistake and never sent her paperwork off, I'm currently in the process of putting that through and getting her registered. There is a microchip in place, though.

&gt; She is litter trained and hasn't had any accidents since having her. Unlike Oscar who doesn't understand that he can wee/poo outside, Martini would rather wait until she can go outside. She does it away from home, too.

&gt; She likes to explore, but doesn't go far at all. Neither cat goes too far and will come back 90% of the time you call them. If there's food involved then they'll most likely come back.

&gt; Both cats are indoor cats, and can happily be in doors all day, but they do need their outdoor time, too. Martini will do her business outdoors, whereas Oscar will look out/smell for any other cats in his garden and mark his territory as necessary.

&gt; ----
&gt; The family I'd like to rehome to:?
&gt; ----
&gt;Ideally I'd like them to go to somewhere, ideally a forever home, with someone who is settled, and has no intention of moving (for a few years - I don't think they like the new scenery/environment)?.

&gt; Ideally the new owners will be middle aged, with older kids. Neither cat handles being picked up/stroked constantly, so I wouldn't put them through going to a young family as I know they wouldn't like it at all (they lived with my ~3 year old niece, and I knew they didn't like it when she picked them up).

&gt; Somewhere away from busy/main roads. Oscar is not clever enough to understand roads, so somewhere quiet, secluded, is best, or somewhere residential with a quieter road, will also be fine.

&gt; All I really want for them to live the remainder of their lives being happy and content with their new owners and environment. They both have a lot to give, and I know they'll make someone else extremely happy, just like they've made me.

&gt; That's about all I can think of at the moment, I'm sure I'm missing out a million other things, but if there's anything else you'd like to know, then please get in touch. I do have an endless supply of picture of both cats (even when Oscar was a little kitten) which are adorable. So let me know if you need any more.

&gt; Both Oscar and Martini need to be rehomed together as they've been together since they were both very young and are the best of friends, and I wouldn't be able to sleep knowing that I've split them up.

&gt; I'm not entirely sure how they'd cope being with other animals, as they've only lived with each other. They did however learn to live with Mini (the 3rd cat) and they're all friends now, so I'm sure the same would happen again. In regards to dogs, I'm not entirely sure they'd be able to cope with a young excitable dog/breed, but maybe an older/more chilled dog, I think they'd learn to cope.


and here's an additional photo album of the cats:

You're more than welcome to PM me for my email or phone number. 

I will need to see the house of the person I'm rehoming them with, just so I can put my mind at ease. I do drive, I can do all of the travelling.

With the international break now is probably a good time to talk about the recent spout of downvoting that I've come across recently on /r/avfc. 

The downvote button is not a disagree button, I can't stress this enough. With the club in a poor fun of form, I have seen an increase in the level of downvoting. Obviously we all have our own opinions on what is going right or wrong at the club, but downvoting someone for opposing your opinion is not acceptable.

Discussion and a wide variety of opinions should be welcomed with open arms, it encourages healthy debate, with that comes increased activity in the sub and more subscribers. 

99% of the posters here are Villa fans and we all want the same thing for the club, which is to win things. This doesn't mean that we should treat fans of other clubs any differently, I'm aware that having a different United fan posting every week asking about how Cleverely is performing, can be frustrating. But posting things such as ""Pretty sure this is like the fourth time a United fan has come in here asking this..."" first of all doesn't add to any sort of discussion and secondly it gives a negative impression to fans of other clubs of this sub.

This is open for discussion I may be over reacting, or this could be the opinion of a lot of members of this community. Depending on the feedback given, we may start to moderate more heavily in regards to downvoting and negative commenting.

Background:
I am depressed by my acne, i'v tried nearly everything now. Antibiotics, different diets, only sleeping on my back, changing my pillow cases regularly, different DYI masks, different moisturisers  etc I'v had acne for about 7 years now. 

So recently my skin has been breaking out more than usually and I think it could be due to the cleanser or moisturiser i'v been using

Sebamed has a very good reputation so I decided to first replace the cleanser and see how that works out. Now the boots one is a foaming cleanser so I'm not sure if I should try  going for a different type of a cleanser or if foaming ones are ok.

**The family is partly bankrolled by the taxpayer.** They own huge portions of land around the country, including some of the most expensive land in London. They receive millions of pounds every year. The Queen's income is £40m - which she receives from profits from the Crown Estate. But the Crown Estate is partly funded by taxpayers. So while taxpayers invest, the Queen and family reap the profits.

**They are undermining our democracy.** They undemocratically involve themselves with politics. Prince Charles has sent multiple secret letters to government ministers and past PMs, but the public can never see them because the royals are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.

**The institution of the royal family has been directly responsible for countless unjust horrors and deaths in Britain and abroad for centuries.** From the oppression, intolerance, and execution of people in Britain for centuries, to the promulgation of imperialism and slavery across the former colonies.

The main two arguments that I hear for preserving the current system is that the royals bring in more money for the British economy than they take out, and that they are part of our historic tradition. Surely such investment of money and resources could do far more for our country if it were put into the NHS, education, small business investment? Does the notion of tradition truly justify glorifying an undemocratic, politically corrupt, unrepresentative, expensive, and historically-oppressive institution that emphasises the highly unequal nature of British society?

I also have a projector for sale on ebay, but if anyone wants to take it on here i would sell it for £280.

Flash forward a few scenes

The doctor and Clara are talking when suddenly, a knock echoed through the air, coming from the door that's lock with the writing ""DO NOT OPEN"" when there's nothing outside except darkness and barren sand

Edit: I actually forgot to continue.. My bad..

Anyways... Where was I? Oh right! 

So there was knocking on the door but yet there's no one outside (literally) meaning maybe there was some other creature or species that is probably around that the human (and timelord) eyes can't see.. 

There was a creature earlier in the story, the doctor never gave it a name but he figured that there's probably someone (or something) always around us even when we don't know it and that makes me think about that quote earlier about the only man on earth... The line never said that there were no other creatures or animals or any other species left but only that humanity only has one to represent it and that's the lone man.. So maybe there is something knocking on the door (or in some lines, calling the phone) and we could all probably guarantee it's not human or the wind.

Lately I've been watching classic who on netflix and hulu plus and... other sources. I've watched all of the dalek related episodes starting with the 4th doctor genesis of the daleks. I've got to see it was a very enjoyable experience (going all the way through capaldi's season!) It added a lot of canon and fluff for the stolen worlds arch and helped me flesh the universe out a lot. Though I learned hands down my least favorite doctor so far is 7. That rolling R kills me and he is dressed the most absurdly of all the doctors imo. Turns out I really liked 5 as well. From my 3 years or so of dr whovianism it looks like the series really peaked somewhere between 4 and 5. I must go deeper.

How do you get your fix? I've considered books, but again, I'm sure some suck and some are enough to blow my socks off, but I don't know which is what or who or why to pick one ;)

I passed my test on a GSF650 Bandit, which was fun to ride but felt heavy, compared to the other bigger bikes I've ridden. Which are: ER5, Versys 650, Suz Gladius. Though the Bandit was actually more fun to ride (in my opinion, and considering the Versys was ride only in a car park).

Whatever I get will need to cope with around 10k miles the first year I have it, going down to 6/7k a year til I replace it in 2/3 years. This is almost entirely commuting and 2-up touring miles.

I've looked at the likes of 8-10yr old VFR's, ZZR600's, Deauvilles, and the Bandit again. With insurance quotes going from £300 for the Deauville, to £750 for the ZZR, all fully comp and not MCE. But test such bikes is not exactly straight forward.

I hope someone can advise me. I rent a room in a shared house. My landlord lives abroad for most of the year and when he's in the UK he lives in the house with us, this is for about two months of the year. This is my first uncertainty - am I a tenant or a lodger? 

The landlord has a friend who calls in periodically to pick up the mail while he's away and to check the property. That's fine: it's infrequent and we know when he'll be coming. But he cut a key for a different friend this year and that friend has been coming a lot more frequently, at least once a week, to do various bits of admin and printing. She doesn't call ahead, just turns up and lets herself in (most recently tonight at 11.20pm!) and it's starting to irritate all of us. 

I'm not sure what our rights are. I know tenants have a right to privacy, but does anyone know exactly what this means and what the limits are? We only rent our rooms, not the house as a whole, and she's not trying to enter those.

I left the job market in 2009 to be a stay at home mother having only worked in dog grooming/handling and as a care worker within a residential retirement home. I went to Easton and Otley College in Norfolk and completed a National Diploma in Animal Management.

In the time away from working, I spent 2 years as a DJ and manager for an on-line radio station. I did on-line promotion, event organising, I interviewed prospective DJ's and did the administration, responding to emails and sending out speculative emails as well as writing the station's newsletter.

It was voluntary and I left only because my laptop could no longer run all the different software needed, but I treated it almost as a full-time job since by then, my daughter had started school for half days.

Since returning to the job market now that my daughter is in school full time, I have only managed to find one job, telefundraising, which I excelled at but had to leave after changes to work times as they no longer fit around my home life (working 11am to 8pm wasn't practical).

Now I'm desperately searching for work and having no luck (not even hearing back from Christmas Temp work). In the meantime I'm helping out a really small eSports organisation, helping them organise and form a League of Legends team, writing posts on forums and Reddit to find potential team members, as well as acting as the recruiter, informing them of expectations and answering queries before sending them to the Team Leader for trials.

I know my history isn't the best, my lack of driving license or qualifications is holding me back. I don't have the money to do any courses, but if anyone has any advice of think they may have an opening I could fit in, please, respond. Any little piece of information would be greatly appreciated.

I'll give you some info as to what I am thinking: I want to stay in a smaller city to get more of a feel of what England is like and not the commercial/sensationalized version a tourism company will give me. Liverpool sticks out to me. 1) I am an Everton fan and 2) Liverpool seems like a good balance of city/country feel (mind you. I have no idea if I'm correct. Just what my gut is telling me). I would visit London and Manchester while I'm there but I plan to have Liverpool be my ""hub"" (or ""homebase"" for those familiar with baseball). 

Basically, I want to get a small sample of what it's like to live in England. I don't want an itinerary or have some guide tell me where to be at what time. I want to be on my own watch and explore as much or as little as I want. Honestly, just spending all day at a local pub talking to people sounds way more appealing to me than the hustle and bustle of London. 

Would Liverpool provide this? Is there another place I could/should go? I might want to visit other European countries (Ireland mainly but possibly some of the continental nations) while I'm there so how easy/expensive is it to get around?

Going to some football (soccer) matches would be a must as well.

Sadly it's looking quite unlikely that I'll make the Brum meet on the 29th as I have other stuff that now has to come first (booking NYE/going to Portsmouth to see my mum who is over for two days from France/putting aside London money for when BFF is over at Christmas and doing the tourist/dinner/dancing thang/taking my former landlord to court and suchlike).*

So...knowing very little of Wales, I've come here to ask you locals questions about my homeland.

But its such a wide topic, I don't know where to start. So I'll ask a few very general questions, and ask you all to tell me some things you think I should know. Then I can hopefully get more specific.

1 - What would you like to tell me about Montgomeryshire?
2 - What are you most proud about being from Wales?
3 - What is the most ""Wales specific"" food or dish? Do you have a good recipe?
4 - Is there a movie that really captures the heart and soul of Wales?
5 - Is there a very ""Wales like"" piece of winter clothing (like a specific type of coat or hat) that is common there?
6 - What else? Tell me things.

So, sorry for these almost silly questions, but I'd really like to learn more from friendly Wales redditors instead of just relying on Wikipedia and the internet in general.

Thanks!

Here's some of the small things that I didn't notice before when I lived here, which really struck me as different when I came back;

* The grass is greener here. Not metaphorically, but literally. Everything is so verdant over here and the grass is such a vivid green. I love the crunching sound when I walk over it and it's really dense. In Australia and the US, the ground is pretty hard and dusty with patches of brownish-green grass.

* The TV is so good here. I didn't realise how much I've missed watching the morning BBC news. It's so factual and balanced and having no adverts is a godsend. In Australia, there's 5 minutes of adverts every 5 minutes and the ""news"" are mostly infomercials. Also, you can't beat a good bit of Jezza - even if you can't admit that you love to hate it.

* Everything is so cheap here. 90% of stuff in the supermarkets is between £1 and £3 - and this was in Waitrose. Two bags of 6 pack bagels for £2, punnet of pomegranate seeds for £2.15 and £1.20 for 2L of chocolate milk. When I went to Tesco, I was shocked when I was given a refund of £2.29 (on a shop that cost £21) on my receipt because if I shopped at a competitor, it would've been less. Nice bonus. And I love those futuristic scan as you shop thingies.

* The roads are really narrow, meaning most streets have staggered parking. Also, why does everyone drive these econobox manuals? Where I live, almost everyone drives a 4x4 or pick up truck.

* The rate of development is insane. I lived in Central London, and I don't recognise half the buildings on my street now. Most shops have been repurposed as either flats or chain stores. Even the town centre of my quaint hometown in Wales is being redeveloped.

* Why does everyone wear the same thing? The guys (15 to 25) wear light blue jeans, the macklemore haircut, overly plucked eyebrows and a hoodie with ""hype"" or ""obey"" branding. When I left, Superdry and adidas trackies were all the rage. If they're going somewhere fancy, then chinos, a PRL shirt and a peacoat is the go to thing. Girls still have that TOWIE look going on - even some of the sloaney born types that I know.

* British people are so genuine and easy to talk to. In Australia, friendships are more of a group thing and conversations are mostly small-talk about sport or consumerism. Although I was quite popular at school, I never really made any friendships that felt meaningful, and I was starting to wonder whether it was just me. Over here, I've had lots of really interesting conversations and it feels so good to be with my old friends again and we instantly picked up where we left off, almost as if I was never gone.

* British houses are so small. I didn't realise it at the time, but 4,000 sq ft houses with a double garage are the norm in Australia. My bedroom alone is larger than the open plan kitchen where I'm staying at a friends house, and has an ensuite with a walk in robe. Whilst prices themselves aren't too bad £400,000 for a small house in SE England, it's expensive for what you get on a square footage basis. In Australia, the entry price is much higher (at least £750,000) but you get a larger house within 10 miles of the city centre and next to the beach with great nearby amenities.

* I love the old, characterful buildings. I took it for granted when I lived here, but as I was on the road from the airport there were lots of old beautiful old buildings surrounded by gentle hills and wispy trees.

Moved into my new place that (unfortunately) does not have  garage of any kind, so the bike is off the road, up a track, tucked behind a hedge that is in no possible way visible from the public highway. Unless you knew the property was there, you wouldn't even be able to see the house!

Updating my change of address of course when asked I had to answer it is no longer garaged to keep the policy valid.

Monthly premium = almost doubled.

Could not believe it. I understand that not garaging a bike is significantly more risk for them than having it inside, but double my monthly premium and that stupid 30 quid admin charge? Really?

Why does everything have to be so ridiculously hard? Fortunately I wasn't in my own home last night because things would have been smashed, very possibly my iPhone, but instead I had a two minute fuckcuntwat scream whilst my poor family looked on helplessly.

The scam, fyi: 

I really appreciate your response to my email. Just to let you know that I'm satisfied with the condition of the item. I will like to purchase this item for Someone as an Birthday Gift so kindly withdraw the advert from Gumtree but i will not be able to look at the item or pick it up from your place because i am currently not in UK, I'm representing my company on an official trip.
(1) I will like to know why you are selling this item and do you have the receipt of the item.
(2) I will pay your asking price for the item and will also add an extra £40 to the money so as to cover the shipping and insurance charges.
(4) I will prefer the shipment to go through Royal Mail.
(5) And about the payment, My mode of payment will be through PayPal because it is fast for a safe,secure,reliable transaction and easy to send money online,So get back to me with your PayPal email address or send me a PayPal money request so that i can send out the payment and as soon as you received the payment you can make the shipment,But if you don't have a PayPal account you can quickly set-up one at (www.paypal.com/uk) it is easy and save and it's free also your reply will be appreciated by me if you get back to me asap.

Thanks hope to hear back from you soon.

It all seems all in good spirit until the host said something which got me thinking. They're thinking of treating female prisoners completely differently to their male counterparts. They're talking about building a new prison in Inverclyde because regular prison is too stressful for women. 

What comes with this new prison you ask? There's to be phones in each ""room"" (no longer to be called cell because it's ""traumatic""). Women would be allowed to talk to their children this way because they miss their children (implying more than their male counterparts) and families. They said that the children suffer more from lack of a mother in their life due to prison so they will have sleepover nights. 

This is where it became even more appalling. Usually there's two people invited on to the show both with differing views from each other's so as to have both sides represented but they only allowed those who were for this sort of idea. Of callers who were against such sexist treatment, they were simply outnumbered 4:1 with those who were against it not given a chance to defend their stance but those who did support it got more time. 

They also suggested that females suffered a traumatic event in their life that lead them to offending whereas men just offended for the sake of it. When asked about whether they're thinking of doing the same treatment for men, there was an abrupt no of an evasive nature. The two lady experts on the show felt that more women were in prison than men and found it unjust somehow. 

In a time where people are screaming a shouting about equality and whatnot, it's shocking to see this sort of thing aired and taken as a legitimate. Switch the genders here and you'd bet there'd be a riot. 

For the first time in my life, I've really begun to question certain equality movements due to discussions such as these being taken seriously. I don't know if the BBC are just that shitty but I doubt so because no one has seemed to make any noise whatsoever about this and the way the host acted as if this was justified . I shit you not, one of the lady experts then went on to say when asked about equality ""women are treated unfairly in society anyway"". These are the people who are doing researches ladies and gentlemen. Female prisoners will now basically be on holiday because ""they're different from men"". So they're only different in cases where it benefits them but as soon as it doesn't, it's considered sexist? 

I'm absolutely livid at the way discussions are held when it comes to inequality against men. So many feminists make noise over a shirt yet I bet I'll hear nothing of this on the 6 o'clock news. I just wanted to start a discussion and see if anyone else had caught this or what you think. 

As a men, I feel as if I'm just something to use and throw into the rubbish bin when I've been used for whatever purpose society has for me. Is this the sort of future I can expect for my sons?

Norwegian guy here who does not follow british football, and I have some questions for you!

Daehli is currently dominating on the Norwegian National Team, and has been for quite some time. I've always been watching the National Team, and i've seen every match he has played so far. My opinion is that he is the best player on the team (the team in general is not very strong atm, and completely lacking of big international stars, but we have regulars from Bundesliga, LaLiga, and other Championship clubs). He is creative, have very good ball control, AND he´s only 19 - wouldn't it be smart in every way to give him match practice (and keep him in the club)?

I´ve seen your couch say that he hasn't seen Daehli play enough (he has missed 2 practices in total so far), and that he has a hip injury (Daehli says the physiotherapist says he's fine, and he does not seem to be bothered by it on the National Team? 

What's going on here? I am probably biased, but I don't understand why he isn't allowed to play more. If i had the 63rd most talented player under 21 in my squad, I would put in an effort to keep him there and make him better.

You may not know it but the top speeds quoted in broadband ads only need to apply to 10% of customers. Our survey found that only one in ten people are aware of this rule.

We think providers are selling people short by advertising speeds only 10% of customers could get, so we're calling on the advertising watchdogs to change the rules - providers should show the speeds the majority of customers will actually get.

Seeking any advice that would be of great help to me to find out where I stand in this situation legally. 

I'll write this out in a TLDR format.

Live in London, UK.

Popular Vlogger posts video on YouTube seeking funding for his new App business in Jan 2014.

I miss out on the opportunity as the video was posted hours after I watched it.

I emailed the video owner expressing my interest in his new company and he offered me a 8% stake for 2000USD, this was a special exception to let me invest as all of the available stake had already been sold off.

This was all confirmed over gmail email and the funds were transferred to his account.

My stake hold was confirmed several times over email.

His gmail account is confirmed to be him, no phishing here guys.

Received no Companies House statement of my stakehold or any evidence DESPITE him promising to send.

Months pass, he stops responding to my emails.

He continues to post videos to his large Youtube community showcasing his new gadgets, cars, houses and wealth.



What are my options to contact him, do I have any legal backing to recover the money?

I have looked into all of the potential discounts available through insurance, but what I am looking to find out is which companies seem to be the best for new drivers? 
What type of vehicle would be best for my family situation?

Also, any tips or advice regarding the aforementioned situation would be appreciated.",false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,null,null,self,Looking for advice on current situation:,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/2mkf0q/looking_for_advice_on_current_situation/

http://i.imgur.com/eT3b1R7.png

We're clearly lacking depth in the Goalkeeper department, and whether we splash the cash to directly replace Mignolet, or buy a competent back-up to provide competition is up to Rodgers. But its clear we need another GK as Jones, isn't a good enough back up. Chelsea, United, Arsenal, City and even Spurs have two competent keepers. If I were Rodgers I'd look to sign Begovic, Romero, or a young German keeper.

The full backs are exciting, Manquillo and Moreno have unlimited potential- Manquillo could become a fantastic defensive full back, in the mold of player such as Juanfran Arbeloa, Azpilicueta etc. Just got to hope he doesn't stay with Atletico following this season. Wisdom is another with so much promise, he's got everything you want in a physical full back/centre back. Pace, strength, and looks to have improved his tactical awareness already at West Brom. Moreno has the potential to be an unbelievable wing back; his dribbling, crossing, and attacking movement is up there with the best in the league. His defensive lapses are worrying, but most of the worlds best wing backs aren't that great defensively ala Dani Alves, Baines, and Jordi Alba. Flanagan is going to be our versatile defensive sub for years, can never see him gaining a permanent starting spot but he shown how good he can be last season. Johnson and Enrique will both probably be gone next summer so it's pointless discussing as Johnsons contract is running out, and Enrique is either unfit or off-form lately. Only problem may be that Manquillo, Wisdom and Flanagan aren't the best offensively, which Rodgers seems to prefer in full backs, and may suit the 4-4-2 diamond formation better.

The Centre Backs are obviously controversial, I'd argue that our best centre back is Sakho, and that Lovren/Skrtel are far too similar to play together effectively (bad positioning, communication, organisation) and need a cool head next to them such as Toure or Sakho. I think due to his age, the price we paid for him and his potential to improve Lovren has to start alongside Sakho. I can see Toure leaving next summer, and Ilori to play for the senior team as a 3rd/4th centreback as I believe he has all the tools to be a very good centre back- pace, tactical awareness, and he can only improve especially in a system that relies on the individual defenders physical attributes. Coates, another I can see leaving following his loan spell. I don't think we need to buy a centre back, just some world class backroom staff to coach them.

The defensive midfield position is by far the weakest in the squad. Gerrard just physically can not play their anymore and mentally he honestly hasn't been the same since the end of last season. He needs to be used as a sub and in his natural position behind the striker. The other options at CDM currently are Lucas, who looks set to be leaving in January and Can/Allen. Can has so much potential but I don't think he'd benefit from playing as the deepest midfielder not allowing him to make box to box runs. Allen is a capable DM, but far better in a pure CM role. This is the position we most need to invest most in, in January at the latest if we want to make top 4. Carvalho, Bender, Kramer, Kondogbia, Krychowiak, De Jong or Cabaye could be bought and would completely transform the team.

The CM spot in this Diamond is pretty solid, with Henderson, Allen, Can, Gerrard, Rossiter all able to cover it. This system also gets the best out of Henderson and Allen who have both hit bad form lately.

The CAM/Wide Midfielder position is pretty solid, with Coutinho as inconsistent as he may be has so much potential and again benefits from the diamond. Lallana who may not live up to his price tag, but will definitely be a good option for the next few years, and Suso has the potential to be special, but may never realise his potential at Liverpool if the reports about him moving to AC Milan are true. 

The CF/CAM role, does not need improving slightly. This position suits Sterling the most, and his backups in Markovic (apparently really good just yet to show anything so far) and Ibe (very good, could be starting in a few years). 

The SS role occupied by Balotelli, is hard to comment on so far. Its clear Balotelli is a secondary striker, he always has been and he always will be one. The fact that Rodgers bought him and Lambert, both secondary strikers makes me believe Rodgers' plan this season is to use a 4-4-2 Diamond with Sturridge obviously leading the way. Balotelli is still an unknown quantity, but I hate to say as he comes from the same town as me but Lambert is simply not good enough to even be a backup striker for us. Also Luis Alberto imo is decent and would work well as a secondary striker if we gave him time to adapt to the Premier League. If we plan on using a 4-4-2 Diamond Balotelli must improve once next to Sturridge, and if not we may cut our losses on him and Lambert and revert to a one striker system. 

The ST position is one of our strongest, as Sturridge is one of our only World Class players and Origi has shown how he could be a future world class player for Belgium on international duty. I still believe in Borini as a solid back-up, and think he could potentially be a Dirk Kuyt type of sub- versatile and hard working.

TL;DR The 4-4-2 Diamond has to be used not just this season but the following seasons, it suits our full backs, CMs, and Forwards. Need a defensive coach/proven world class staff to discipline the defence, a goalkeeper, a cdm and maybe a replacement for Balotelli if it doesn't work out.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,"Why the weird 4-4-2 Diamond suits our squad, and should be used not just for this season, but the seasons following on from this one.",16,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2mkh64/why_the_weird_442_diamond_suits_our_squad_and/

Male with combination, mild acne prone skin.
I wanted to do something about it, so recently I ordered this:
Eucerin DermatoCLEAN Cleansing Gel, Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Controll 3-in-1 Daily Cleansing Lotion and Simple Clear Skin Oil Balancing Moisturiser.

No problem with the gel and the moisturiser, the first one is really gentle and doesn't leave my skin thight, the moisturiser helps with the dry parts (cheeks and nose mostly) without being too heavy on the forehead, where I get oilier at the end of the day.

The Neutrogena BHA, however, while leaving my skin matted and, I think, starting to purge it, also causes some midly red areas on my foreahead, a slight itch, and makes my oily parts oilier. I had a similar reaction to Baby Oil. I noticed that both share parfum, so I guess my skin doesn't really like it.

So, my question is: can anyone suggest a better, gentle exfoliator for oily/closed comedones skin? Bonus point if I can order it from Boots. Thank you!

I recently bought a flat just outside of London, but not being from the UK, I'm not exactly sure which would be the best place to buy furniture at.

Obviously Ikea is an option, and I'm sure a lot of things will be bought there, however, there's a couple of bits I don't want from Ikea, such as the bed and the sofa - arguably the most important parts.

Is there a good place you'd recommend to look at sofas and beds? I've checked out DFS, and it has some decent options for the sofas, but I didn't want to spend too much money. I know they have an eBay outlet, so that may help.

Would appreciate your help, if you know of any other nice places that might do clearance sales, have an outlet shop or just good deals for decent products. Hope I'm not asking too much!

Not sure if this is the best place to post this, it is a fundraiser link but just getting word out about what we are doing is vital for us as well and it would seem you folks would possibly be interested in our Documentary... 

Anywho I'm currently producing a short documentary about the Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team, based in Scotland, UK. 

The testimony of team members, past and present, including Cairngorm John tells the stories of the volunteers and their experiences in search and rescue. You can see a short teaser/test footage in the link below.

The film will celebrate the volunteer (unpaid) ethos behind today's rescue teams in the United Kingdom and show people what it means to help those that come to grief on the hills, we also want regular climbers and the Cairngorm mountains to be very much central characters in our cinematic portrait of the team. We're passionate about spreading the awareness of mountain safety and the work of our rescue teams with your support we can, so give us a like a share check out our teaser and let us know your thoughts.

We will be shooting this winter on 35mm film and should have the film finished some time in the spring where we will be submitting it to festivals, organising screenings as well as having a home on the British Mountaineering Councils TV website.

Cheers :D

We're UK based and our accountant (who is also pro-bitcoin) has had a chat with Barclays (who hold our business account(s)) about it, and they have given an unequivocal 'no' to using Bitpay and settling in GBP.

Their reasoning was that Bitcoin fails the KYC - Know Your Customer - regulations that are an aspect of the 'Money Laundering Regulations 2007' which can be found here;

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/2157/contents/made

We talked about USD, but again a no from Barclays, and then looked in to having a US-based bank account, but that also has problems as it would make us liable for sales tax in the US for US-originating sales (which is a PITA we'd rather not have to deal with).

Does anyone have any experience of this, or if it's just utter bollocks from their end? I think it's safe to assume that we'd rather not have yet another account at yet another bank (especially as 'repatriating' those funds in to the office accounts would be difficult) so any way to work with Barclays to get around this snag would be great...but they aren't seemingly willing to play ball.

My argument is that I already have winter experience on a motorbike and now my commute is even shorter!

I thought I should finally introduce myself on here.  I've been lurking for quite a while and finally decided to create an account for this page.  

I have been smoking sticks for a number of years but not really seriously.  Mostly only when I went to see the Old man on holiday.  Him and his boys are bid stogie smokers.  So about a year ago I quit the cigarettes and decided to take up stogies instead.  I've been picking up a few things here and there. This site has been pretty great for picking up useful info when needed.  So I thought I'd say Hi...Hi.  
I live up in North London and have been searching out decent places to smoke as I don't have any outside space in my flat.  Found a few but friends houses w/ balconies and gardens seem to work the best so far.  

I figure I'd add a few pics of my Humidor and my collection so far.  I usually try to pick up sticks from duty free places whenever I travel which has been good for my finances and also has given me a pretty wide range of things to smoke and try out.  

Hope you enjoy the pics...if the links work.  I'm kind of technologically inept.  

But anyway, hello, and it's nice to finally get on here and look forward to chatting and smoking it up with you BOTL &amp; SOFL.

I mean, there's the obvious times, where it's been snowing, or the roads are icy [which largely depends, as well, on the council's ability to salt/grit the roads]. But is there a cut off point where it's time to cover the bike up, and switch to public transport and/or carpool?

I've always thought we were rather sharp in that department but with his line of products at our clubs disposal I expect big things. 

In all seriousness, I just took a look at the telegraph thread on r/soccer and I think the Southampton folks made a great point that their club's recruiting and youth effort is much bigger than just one person. It's true, losing Paul Mitchell won't set them back years or anything. However, I also noticed a lot of stabs at Levy - I think the top comment even called it a panic move. It's understandable how this would be a tasty perspective to have. Spurs are not performing well with Southamptons former manager and now we are grasping at straws trying to raid So'ton for any possible support. That's fine, it's easy to read between the lines and see what you want to see. Maybe that's why I feel good about this decision from Levy, I'm just seeing what I want to see. 

What do we know? We know Levy is keen to overhaul our scouting network. We know Paul Mitchell was at least one of several key scouts at a successful Southampton. We know Southampton was and is a product of a great scout team and club structure. We know PM has a relationship with Poch, to what extent? I'm not sure.

What can we assume? We can assume PM comes on Poch's recommendation which is a good sign on multiple levels. We can assume It means we are giving Poch time and resources to get the squad he wants. We can assume that his status as ""not answerable to Baldini"" means PM will have a major part to play in transfer decisions, as well as direct access to Levy aka the money. We can assume he has been brought in to pass on his expertise and improve our overall scout structure, something we could definitely use. 

What does it all mean? Change is coming, but to what extent remains to be seen. Mitchell is highly respected from his work with MK and So'ton. It's going to be a fresh perspectives, which is important. While I'm hesitant to call Baldini a bust, it seems undeniable that our transfer decisions could use an injection of some new ideas. Before I wrap up, I'd like to get back to an earlier point from the Southampton side of things. Their team won't suffer this loss much but that's not the point. It's a team effort for Spurs as well and by all accounts we have added a great member to our team in Mitchell. 

Anyways it's the freakin international break and I figured I'd open up this for discussion! ",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,Paul Mitchell.,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2mmx8p/paul_mitchell/

Question, Is it a bit right for wealthy musicians who have the ability to pay clever tax accountants to allow their income not to be subjected to tax, to pressure governments to force struggling tax payers (who have to pay their share) into paying for their causes. 

Bono once stated that U2 pay 'a lot of tax'. Which to me would be like saying Starbucks contribution of 5 million pounds is also, 'a lot of tax', but may only represent 1% of annual profits. 

Geldof deflected a similar question on Sky News yesterday regarding band aid.

Last night they agreed to reduce it by £20 a month for the next three months, and they're calling him back in 10 days to discuss other, cheaper packages. 

I'm a bit irked with him for agreeing to another 12 months when I can get him a Sky package for £50 a month through topcashback and save him £600* over the next year (he knew I was looking at it, but sometimes just doesn't listen), but now that the bloody idiot has AGREED to another 12 months, it gives him less negotiating power with Virgin. All they're likely to do is say 'lose the sports and movies channels and we can reduce the bill further.'

I'm guessing this was verbal only... can I get the silly git out of this in any way please?

Bonus tip - many of the local numbers actually pass you through to a different automated menu system too. Bennetts for example has a voice recognition system for its 0800 number, but the 024 number has a much easier, clearer, dialtone system which gets you through to a rep in one selection.

I've been applying for temp work recently and have been surprised by the expectations of employers. We both know the score, I'm a student willing to do work for money to get some savings for university, and you're in need of staff temporarily during a busy period. I'm happy to do the job, even for such a tiny wage, and by it's definition, I'm only going to be working there a few months at best.

So why, when it comes to interviews, am I expected to act like humping boxes around a warehouse for a meager amount of money has been my lifelong ambition, and I not only have to be passionate about stacking, but beg for the privilege to trade away my hours for your spare change?

Obviously, sometimes you just have to play the game, but it's just demeaning. I'm willing and capable to work, they need workers. They're going to pay me minimum wage and the job is going to exist for a short amount of time. Can we just drop the pretense and get on with it, this isn't something I'm willing to beg for the privilege of.

I would have imagined that such houses would go to people in most need, who perhaps can't afford a deposit or the payments on a larger mortgage but need the extra space.

So, does anyone know if there are criteria you need to meet to qualify for one of these houses, or do they just go on a first-come first serve basis? If the latter is true then it kind of defeats the purpose if you ask me.

David Cameron said there is now *“a dangerous backdrop of instability and uncertainty”* that presents *""a real risk to the UK recovery""*, adding that the eurozone slowdown is already having an impact on British exports and manufacturing.

Cameron stressed that *retreating from the world or imposing extra tax and borrowing may seem easy solutions but they would instead prove only to be a repeat of the mistakes of the past*

He claimes that the G20 communique hammered out over the past few days endorsed Britain’s determination to use monetary policy to support growth and he would not waver on his policy of paying down government debt.

The emphasis on potential dangers, balancing some more hubristic ministerial accounts of the state of the UK economy, reflects David Cameron’s concern – underlined by conversations at the G20 – about the extent to which Britain can detach itself from gathering economic storms.

He said the G20 had taken fresh steps to clamp down on corporate tax avoidance, pointing out that 92 tax authorities were now cooperating by sharing information which would enable G20 countries to raise an extra $32bn in tax revenues.

*“This is not some arcane dry and dusty subject,”* Cameron said at his closing press conference. *“The more we can make sure big corporations pay their taxes properly, the less we have to tax hardworking people who I want to make sure can keep more of their own money so they can spend as they choose.”*

The Workers Union (TUC) general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “*Too many world leaders seem to think any jobs will do when they should be thinking about the security and quality of those jobs. The same story of casualisation, part-time work and insecurity in the labour market is spreading across the world.”*

This may be contentious I'm not sure, but just reflecting on series 6 (and 5 and 7) and I think one of the things that let it down was the whole River Song story line. This is nothing against Alex Kingston, or River's character *per se* (though she definitely got more annoying later on compared to Silence in the Library, partly due to Moffat writing women simply as catchphrases), and I'm not even talking about her arc really. The revelation of her being the Ponds' daughter was decent.

It's because Moffat cast the 11th Doctor's wife, **before** he cast the 11th Doctor. He's said that he originally wanted the 11th Doctor to be much older ([source](http://www.wired.com/2009/01/bbc-announces-m/)), but was won over by Matt. They're miscast as a couple. She may have worked with an older Doctor, she just doesn't really work with 11. I think Moffat tried to make her a bit more compatible later, partly why she's a bit different to her debut, but it's not really effective. It makes the whole wedding plot a bit silly.

At the end of series 6 it seems that the 11th Doctor marries River not because he wants to or because loves her...but because he *has* to, to save the universe. He does it to manipulate her into trusting him...I think (I'm still not exactly sure to be honest). Does that really sound like a believable or 'healthy' marriage? I'll leave you to decide......but the answer's no.    

It's poor writing, and I think it's the reason that many of your average Joe-public (and me) just couldn't get invested in their relationship, and ultimately, much of series 6. It's the result of poor writing, and miscasting River (though I emphasise, it's not really Alex's fault). Strangely it seems that the Doctor *does* develop feelings for her by the end of series 7 (""I thought it would hurt **me**""). Why? I don't know.

Thoughts?


Ps I actually do *like* series 6, it's possibly my favourite after 5 (and maybe 8, but 7 might be my least favourite). I even quite like tWoRS, even though it's all quite silly and doesn't really appeal to a wide audience as DW should. Matt is my favourite Doctor, I just think that his run and series 6 in particular was let down a bit by this aspect.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR. Don't like River being the Doctor's wife because they're poorly cast as a couple

&amp;nbsp;
*****
&amp;nbsp;

Edit: After some discussion and reflection I think it's accurate to say the reason their relationship doesn't work is because of poor/rushed writing and character development. I still think the casting is an important factor, and it's interesting that River was cast before 11. To be clear, I don't really dislike River, and her being Melody Pond is fine. I take issue with her being the Doctor's wife, I don't buy it. I prefer to think of her as 11's wife at most, though I'm not sure River sees it that way (based on how she was with 10, and ""I have pictures of all your faces"" yada yada).

I would like to hear from people who have knowledge about how broadband works and law.

I have received this message from TalkTalk

 

Dear Mrs XXXXXX
 
We're all talking, watching, streaming and downloading more than ever before, not just at home, but on the go as well. **That's why we're investing to speed up your totally unlimited broadband and boosting your call plans.** And all this comes with Britain's best savings features built into your package.
 
To meet these ever-changing needs, **we occasionally need to raise our prices.** Your line rental will go up to £16.70 a month from 17th December 2014 and the call connection charge will go up to 16p from 1st January 2015. You will still be saving £184 compared to BT*.

______________________________

It's a load of flannel presumably intended to act as a justification for the latest round of price rises.

I would be fascinated to hear from you people who have knowledge in broadband and law as to the precise details of TalkTalk's investment; how exactly speeds are going to rise within the constraints of existing technology; and how they are ""boosting our call plans"" other than by charging more for them.

________________________________


This is one answer I received from forum TalkTalk panel:

 Thanks for your post.  

 The investment goes towards fibre provisioning and new technologies such as our current trial in [York](https://sales.talktalk.co.uk/ultrafast/)
There are obvious instances where speeds just simply cant be increased such as rural areas, but the aim is to provide fastest speeds possible over ADSL/LLU and Fibre.

 

Regards.

5% goes into a workplace pension through salary sacrifice which is matched by my employer. The remainder goes into a Cash ISA where I'm accumulating an emergency fund before moving onto my next savings goal.

My dad realised the other day he'd been sitting on about £3000 worth of shares in SSE on my behalf which we're now working out what to do with.

Coincidentally I'm about £3k off my emergency fund goal. So by selling the shares I'd meet that goal and be able to move onto other things. And in any case I don't think at my current level of savings I should be fannying around with individual stocks, and instead should be looking to work towards investing in a fund.

Having said that the annual return on the shares themselves has been around 5% and if I sold I've be moving the money into a cash ISA with an annual return of only 1.75%.

1. If I do go back, I wouldn't need any work visa or anything like that would I?

3. With #3 in mind, how hard is it to get accepted into the University of Liverpool? And if I do get in, will they charge me International prices because I'm coming from America

Me and another are looking to buy a house/apartment in London. My friend has 50K in savings and I have 10K in savings.


Would it be as simple as, we both put in for the deposit, then we both pay the mortgage equally. When it comes to selling the house then we'd split the total we've both put in and work out the equity as a ratio of our input then split it that way. 


And when it comes to one of us moving out, we'd check if the other wants to buy the other out - if it's not possible both sell (above) and separately find new houses? 


We're pretty good friends and have good trust. Obviously neither of us want to make the arrangement unfair on the other. Any feedback would be appreciated, thanks.

I casually follow UK news because did a study abroad there once in college and generally like some of your TV shows. I catch Prime Minister's questions on CSPAN from time to time, and I like listening to the BBC late at night on public radio.

Lately it seems like there's such terrible news coming out of the UK. Three big ones come to mind:

* Large-scale pedophilia scandals (the one with the TV childrens show host and then the ring of pakistani men (?))
* Jihadi John and the problem of a ton of young men leaving the UK to fight for ISIS
* An article about Britain being poorer than the poorest states of the US: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/08/25/britain-is-poorer-than-any-us-state-yes-even-mississippi/

It just sounds like the UK is in decline in a bad way, and that things are pretty awful there. I know it's hard to separate your personal views of the country from some kind of objective view, but what do you think is the general public sentiment of the UK and its future?

Alternatively, can you give me 3-5 things/trends in the UK that are new/recent/current that people in general are excited about, feel proud of, sense as progress/optimistic/a step forward? I.e., what has the UK done recently that's pretty fantastic?

What's interesting that while the percentages go up a couple of steep hills, the tax paid and net income actually scales quite linearly.

I've not gone below 25,000 because there are so many specific tax breaks in that range (income support, tax credits, child benefits) that it becomes really variable how you are individually taxed.

Also, I've assumed a £196/month council tax because that is what I pay in extortionate Hampshire. Though on the higher income levels, council tax becomes a vanishingly small part of the total tax level.

I am worried about getting refused at the border and having my entry denied. I previously was in the UK for three and a half weeks, to visit family friends and my boyfriend, about a month and a half ago. I got through the border just fine. I am more concerned now since I will be staying for longer.

I will be staying with my boyfriend and his parents, and his parents will be sponsoring me throughout my stay. When they ask who I am staying with, do I answer 'family friends' or do I answer 'My boyfriends family'? I have full proof of bank statements from the parents earnings to prove they have sufficient funds for my stay, I also have copies of their passports to prove they are legitimate UK citizens.

The main reason for my visit to the UK is to visit UK gaming conventions, and I will have a full itinerary of the conventions I plan to visit, as well as any other sites I plan to visit throughout my stay. My boyfriend, although he is from, and currently lives in the UK, is not the main reason that I am visiting. I work in online gaming entertainment, and the main purpose of my visit is to gain information that will help me in my work when I return to the USA, as I am not planning to work in the UK. I do want meet people in the UK at gaming conventions and understand UK gaming culture to bring that home with me to improve my work.

As for returning home, because I work for myself, I have no contract from my employer stating when I will go back to work, because I choose my work hours, and I am able to take time off as and when I please. I have a dog back in the USA, along with living with my mom, I have to look after my 6 year old sister when she is out of the house. I will have a letter from my mom saying that she does need me back to help watch my sister while she is working.

I don't plan on mentioning my boyfriend, as that is not the main purpose of my visit, however if asked if I have one, I will answer honestly. I do have a return flight booked. I have already researched that as an American citizen, I can stay for 6 months within a 12 month period so I certainly wouldn't be outstaying my welcome. Should this be sufficient for me to be allowed into the UK or should I provide anything else? I am kind of terrified from all the horror stories I have read online and need some words of advice.

What I am basically asking is if I am at risk of being refused for having a boyfriend in the UK, even though he is not the main reason for my visit, and if having the ties I currently have to the USA will be deemed insufficient due to the nature of my work.",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,self,Concerned About UK IO/Being Denied Entry,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/2mowbn/concerned_about_uk_iobeing_denied_entry/

2 years ago we were known as a sacking club, we sacked our CL winning manager and in the end (even though he was interim) we let go of a Manager who won us the EL. 

But this season this habit of our owner has changed.  Let's be serious, if it was any other manager apart from Jose  last year he would have gotten the sack for having a trophy-less season. But it didn't happen, maybe this was already decided btw Mou and Roman that even though he may not win a trophy in his first season he would be given time. 

And now we are enjoying the  fruits and benefits of not sacking our Manager and giving him time. Now that Mouriniho has built his own type of side we are on the top once again. Imagine, if he was sacked at the start of the season, a new Manager would have come in and tried to make his own side and he would either succeed or fail-whatever and the cycle would have still kept going on and on.

I just moved to the UK (EU citizen/Italian, but been living in 25+ countries in the last 5yrs, so I've been basically off the radar of pretty much any government most of this time, beside some small earnings in UK, Australia and New Zealand).

Now, I've started working here by myself supplying restaurant with products from Italy.
This first two weeks (started basically on monday last week) I've had roughly 2k GBP in revenues and keep roughly the 25% in net profit.

How does it work in the UK for these circumstances? 
I have no NIN, but I will be living in the uk less than 4 or 5 months per year (rest of the time I'd be traveling around SE Asia).
Being a seasonal business, I will be trading for another 90 days and then leave the country. I don't think I will hit 10k in net profit.

My questions are : 
* Do I neet to get a business number through the Uk Gateway (just finished registering, offers me a ton of services to enroll for)
* I pay VAT in Italy (22%) and don't charge any VAT atm : should I register for VAT before hitting the VAT threesold?
* I have made invoices for the payment I have received (mostly cash and cheques) and I'm also keeping track of my expenses already.

My idea was : first test the market and demand, see if idea is viable, then worry about registering.

Artory is a collaboration between I-DAT (http://i-dat.org - part of the university, and who I work for), Elixel (http://www.elixel.co.uk/) and Plymouth Arts Centre (http://www.plymouthartscentre.org/). We're not a random marketing company, and this project has been born from research work we've doing around gathering audience feedback in new ways to enable arts groups to provide better for their audiences (something Plymouth desperately needs!)

Feel free to ask me anything about the project here, and if you would like to come along to the test day (and if you do, I'll give you a high five and thank you profusely for helping) just send me a Private Message and I'll get in contact with you to give you the details.",false,plymouth,t5_2sh6u,null,null,self,Free on Monday?

I have good knowledge of Java and algorithms in general. I've also worked while in college and have over one year of experience as a full stack PHP developer(mainly Magento and WordPress) at a local agency. I've toyed with many other programming languages and am eager to start my career in one.
