My only gripe is this: Please stop leaving John Mikel Obi out of your team.  We have 30 million talented attacking players, so it's tempting to throw as many as you can onto the pitch, but it's really important to have a defensive midfielder: **the defensive midfielder position is only the most important position in the game.**

No Chelsea fan or Real Madrid fan can stress just how true this is judging by the results of the Claude Makelele transfer: Real Madrid lost their La Liga title to Barcelona the next year, and of course, Chelsea won their first Premier League title in 50 years.

On the team, the only other player that can kind of start as a holding midfielder is Michael Essien, but I don't think many people prefer him in that position over Obi.  The only other possibility is a crappy double pivot with Ramires, but again, you're not going to have a true holding midfielder.

Steady, preferably non-commission based work, preferably around the SE3 area, but I am willing to travel. I am a dedicated worker and a fast learner and adapt my old skills to fit in with a new line of work. 


**My experience:** 
 I have, most recently, had experience in face-to-face sales/ fundraising, this experience has allowed me to develop great communication and people skills, the ability to work well under pressure, allowing myself to be better organised so as to work more efficiently and meet deadlines, how to deal professionally with difficult customers, and how to interact well with a variety of people and personalities.

I have been a volunteer teaching assistant for Southend Adult Community College, assisting for the Maths and Science departments, I would usually be assigned a student or two to shadow during a class, make sure they understood the lesson and help them when needed. If I was not required to shadow particular students I would be called over by students who needed help while the main tutor continued their class without interruption. 

I co-founded and supervised a successful collaborative group that focused on educated teens about minorities in an effort to decrease bullying rates, we did this through presentations, performances, sponsored comics in college/ school newspapers, workshops, and home made films (even performing a presentation to the staff of a school about equal opportunities and stereotyping in the workplace).

I was a prefect at school and a leading student representative of my college.


**My Skills** 
I have 15 A*-C GCSEs (Including, English literature/ language, Maths, and Science)
L2 BTEC in Business based ICT  L3 BTEC Applied Science.
4 AS-Levels - Chemistry, Physics, Psychology, and Maths.

I am trained in business based ICT on both PC and MAC format, I have experience using Opera PMS (for hotels), and 10 months of reception experience with an insurance company. 

Safety in the workplace (&amp; safe learner) training.


**About me:**
I am a dedicated, professional, well mannered, organised, level headed young man and I can keep calm and work well under pressure.
I am starting my undergraduate degree in Criminology and Psychological studies in October - this will be through a distance learning course and will not affect any hours I can work as I can be flexible with my studies.

Two legs, good!), he touches his long hair and exclaims ""I'm a girl!"" but then I think touches his adams apples and says, oh no, guess not. 

Just wanted to throw that out there, as this strongly supports that the Doctors **CAN** be a woman, and that he may not actually have any control over whether he is or not (just as he has no control over if he is a ginger). 

Edit: And just to clarify, I'm not saying the next Doctor will be a woman, should be a woman, or that I want it to be a woman.

Basically I'm a 22y/o apprentice and alternate between 1 week at college and 1 week at work and in october I will be working full time. My commute is Portsmouth -&gt; Bitterne, it's a 42mi round trip on the M27 or about the same if I avoid the M27.

As I'm pretty poor at the moment I wouldn't be able to drop £2-3k to do my full test, buy gear and get an old 600 however I'm thinking I could do my CBT, buy gear and get insured on an old 125 and do the non-motorway route.

Would this feel too long on a 125? Should I save up?

This is the first time I've applied to join a team so I'll make it short. First of all I would like to say a few good things about choosing ME for your team! :P
1) I have a good personality
2) I live in Essex (Shu'p) ;) Joking. Seriousely.
3) I have a decent mic and can use Skype or whatever.
4) I'm on most evenings, but since it's summer holidays GCSE stuff won't be in the way till september so I'll be on all evenings :P
5) I would say that I'm smart, and I can think up quick strategies as I have been playing RTS's all my life.

Now for the Dota stuff... :)
I can usually play the role of support. Well with windrunner, vengeful spirit etc. I can swap roles around and I know most mechanics of the game i.e pulling neutral creeps, drafting etc. 

Now, to be perfectly honest I wouldn't say I am the most profound Dota player but with the right team I can offer some great support and hopefully plenty of wins! (Public games are starting to annoy me &gt;.&lt;)

I hope you'd be interested in me as a team mate so if you need to contact me:
Steam - MTBJoe (or) joe_izatt
Skype - tigerpjs
Facebook?! - Joe Izatt &lt;- the one and only.

ALSO, I'd like to point out if your a team of 2 for instance, I have 2 friends who play Dota regularly also and we play evenings together. So I could also offer some other players if your stuck. Again this is the first time I've ever applied so forgive me if this is the wrong place... or something like that.

There seems to be a lot of hate towards Loyalism lately and it's totally understandable why. I'm not a Loyalist, I disagree with a lot of what Loyalism stands for, and I most certainly do not associate with the Orange Order or any of the unionist political parties. I'm a simple Unionist Libertarian who hates pretty much everyone's political view point in Northern Ireland equally.

So when I look at Northern Ireland I look upon a nation of equal idiots. Loyalism, Republicanism, Alliance politics, Christian Conservatism etc. are all the same to me. I'm not trying to act like some pseudo intellectual knob. I'm just suggesting that a more centered point of view is in order here.

I believe that, to and extent, Loyalism has a certain point in all of the anger coming from that end of NI politics. While I see it as wholly pointless to riot over such a matter I think that we can't look past the fact that the vast majority of people who don't support the Parades Commisions stupid idea to not let them walk past the shops and attended the parades - didn't riot. 

That removes the excuse that 'der aw rioters and supports it, so they don't matta!' crap. Most of them aren't rioters and most of them don't support the rioting. Most of them have something that is very important to them and not very important to you or me. That is the idea of culture to them - and while the snobs of this country scoff at such a thing, the reality of the situation exists that this is a culture and will remain that way. 

I'm not suggesting that we prop up Loyalist culture. It's not a tax payers responsibility to maintain any form of culture - it's a natural evolution. And that brings me onto my main point of the argument:

You won't get rid of Loyalism - it isn't going to go away no matter how many restrictions and no matter how many times you suggest they (being the groups) should be banned. I'm not suggesting we appease Loyalism but why not, for the love of keeping Northern Ireland somewhat normal - embrace it. OK, embrace it is a strong phrase but an acceptance of it's existence will, in my opinion, begin to prevent the anger that exists in Loyalism from coming out everytime the government makes a stupid decision. These are angry young people who aren't accepted by society and therefore release their anger through warped political views. Why not start accepting these people as part of society. 

And before anyone starts this nonsense of, ""oh we would but they won't join us in 'society'"" It's those very viewpoints that exclude these people from society as we know it. Excluded in what some call 'ghettos' from the normal. 

The pompus and supremacist shite I've been reading on here is part of the grand old problem with this country. It's only one thing and I'm not suggesting it's going to fix all our problems. I also don't expect you to agree with this opinion because you're reddit and probably won't - but that's fine, we can't all think the same or it'd be a really boring world. But instead of slaggin'/downvoting/being a general gobshite, you could instead actually invoke an actual discussion about this instead of the consistent hate.

At the moment I’m working towards my car licence and should have that before august but as soon as I pass my practical I am going to start learning to ride. My motivations are twofold:

1. I love motorbikes, have for as long as I can remember. I cycled to school every day for almost 6 years and just love being on two wheels. Learning to drive has taught me that cars just aren't the same; I really don't like the disconnected feeling from the environment, oh and they are very boring.

2. I really need a mode of transport for university, my house for next year is quite a distance from the campus and I have lots of hours because of my degree. The is a mix of twisty b-roads and huge hills on my commute, Sheffield gets very cold in the winter and snow is common for about a month of the year. The journey takes less than ten minutes in a car but parking is a nightmare, the are however loads of spots for bikes. I would also like to be able to use the motorbike to go home or visit my girlfriend on weekends, parents live close to Liverpool (about 70 miles away) and girlfriend is in Manchester (about 40 miles away).

My dad used to ride to work every day on a Cagiva Raptor 650 from about 2003 (not 100% sure on the year), but he stopped riding a few years ago and the raptor has been in the garage since then, the is something wrong with the electronics and the alarm goes off when the battery is connected, the local garage says they can fix it for £200-£300. He bought it second hand for about £2000 from an owner who had also left it standing for months at a time. I’m pretty sure he would sell it to me for about £500.

My mother hates the idea of a motorbike, the main reason I am learning to drive is to appease her that I have some experience in a car, I think she was hoping I would like the car more and decide to go with that instead. Good safety equipment is even more essential that normal because I’m pretty sure if I ever crashed I would end up losing any life I had left by her hands.

I have spoken to the local rider training centre and they will take me from knowing nothing to passing my test for about £700. I already understand the current laws with regard to licences so I don’t need that explained to me.

I can afford to spend about £2200 when all is said and done (insurance, kit, tax, mot and whatever else I need), but that’s going to be a real stretch as far as my budget goes so anything under this would be stellar.

Basically I want some advice on what I should do. I need to have this sorted before I go back to university in September.

Thanks for the help!

Who's recently and in the episode ""The Deadly Assassin"" I heard the master state that he was at the end of his 12th regeneration, the doctor replies with ""And that is the end of time lords"". I nearly shit myself so i looked it up on Wikipedia and i read this about halfway down the page.

It is first stated in The Deadly Assassin (1976) that a Time Lord can regenerate twelve times before dying (thirteen incarnations in all). There are exceptions to this rule, however; when a renegade Time Lord known as the Master finds himself at the end of his regenerative cycle, he takes possession of the body of another person to continue living (The Keeper of Traken, 1981), although he was using the Source of Traken to bind his mind to the body. It may be that the Time Lords also have the ability to circumvent the limit – in The Five Doctors (1983) the Master is offered a new cycle of regenerations by the High Council in exchange for his help. The fact that the Master is inhabiting a non-Gallifreyan body at the time implies that it is possible to grant them to a non-Gallifreyan, albeit one inhabited by a Time Lord mind (although River Song is shown to have the ability to regenerate due to altered DNA that has similarities to Time Lord DNA, a side effect of being conceived in a TARDIS). In ""The Sound of Drums"" (2007) the Master is revealed to have been granted a new body by the Time Lords during the Time War with at least one regeneration possible. Non-Gallifreyans are also seen to regenerate in Underworld (1978) and Mawdryn Undead (1983), but with adverse side effects. In Mawdryn Undead these appear to be the result of mishandling stolen technology, but in Underworld they are implied to be the inevitable result of limited technology that reinvigorates, rather than transforms, the subject's appearance (in this case, the Minyans, with whom the Time Lords shared much of their technology), thereby regenerating 'the body, not the soul'.

I am really wondering what is going to happen, because [SPOILER] Matt smith is the 12th doctor. John Hurt is taking the role of a past doctor (The doctor that participated the in great time war). But it has been confirmed that there is in fact going to be a doctor after Matt Smith.

We were suggested serviced apartments by the company and this comes to around 120 GBP per night, which adds up to a fair bit over the 6 weeks we're there.

I was hoping to tap some local knowledge regarding cheaper accommodation choices. We're a team of three and do not mind sharing a bedroom for the duration of the stay there. We are willing to stay in a town outside the Cambridge city center and drive in. *We got a few online quotes for 1000 GBP cars which we could use to drive in and out.*

We're a new organisation but as it stands in terms of games, our League of Legends team is being formed currently from a selection of Diamond 1/challenger players aiming for Dreamhack and LCS. We have picked up a top COD4 team to sponsor them for the District Prague LAN next month, their team consists of:
Germaine, mark, Luboshmir, caesiuM and Kex.
    For the people who have followed COD4 or played it, you will more than likely recognise all of their names as they have accomplished first place at over 10 LANs individually for different teams and a couple of 1st place as a unit. Players from organisations such as: eSuba, Team Dignitas, TCM Gaming, TEK9, LowLandLions and others.
    We also have another prestigous COD4 team under our banner consisting of D Z E, mnt, R1KK3RT and elkez. A lot of previous experience and great synergy between this team but unfortunately due to real life complications they are unable to LAN.

As DotA2 is growing, we are looking to pick up a DotA2 team to help our organisation and the team we pick up. If all goes well, financial funding will be organised (will have to talk about this in more detail) on a few conditions which once again will have to be discussed. 

If you are interested in representing Revamped Gaming (RVG) on DotA2 online and offline, please send a team application to Michael@revamped-gaming.com

There is no application form so we expect the Captain/Manager (whoever is posting the application) to be able to piece together a professional looking summary of the team. It should include information such as:  What you expect from us, what we can expect from you, team's experience, individual experience's, player profiles. We won't look at emails consisting of 'Hey, me and my friends have been playing DotA2 for a coupe of months now and have won a match together. We'd like sponsorship, thanks'. 

Hope this clears everything up, you can also reply here once you have emailed to notify us of your application.

Our website is being updated (to provide better coverage of the Prague LAN for our Call of Duty 4 squad) but the link is below along with our Facebook and Twitter.

All these rumours are doing my head in, so just as a bit of fun, what is the starting XI that you would realistically like to see walk out in Liverpool colours next season and why? Mine would be:

4-2-2-2: I think the dual striker formation suits us better than the 4-2-3-

GK- Mignolet: I think at the moment he is playing better than Reina and so should start. That said, I wouldn't mind if Reina started either

LB- Enrique: Can't see us splashing the cash on another LB

CB- Agger: Vice-captain

CB- Alderweireld: Despite my fondness of Kelly, I still think we need another, more established partner for Agger and Toby would be my choice

RB- Johnson

CDM- Gerrard

CDM- Lucas

LAM- Coutinho: Despite my insistence that he operates better in the center, I would rather have both Suarez and Studge at the top of the attack than one out on the wing

RAM- Aspas: Unless we get Eriksen, I fully expect Iago to start here over Downing as he can score goals, which BR likes his wingers to do

ST- Suarez: Offer who you want, Higuain, Shaqiri, Robben.. Unless their name happens to be Ibrahimovic, Messi, Ronaldo, Ribery or Falcao, I would have Luis stay, as I think he is a more complete  attacking threat than any player who isn't among the above 5.. Despite what's been said about him, I will continue to back him until and unless he proceeds to hand in a transfer request, which would mean all the diving, biting and other shenanigans are just glimpses of his true, despicable nature.. IF and only IF he hands in a transfer request, I would take the 25-30mil+Shaqiri and switch to a 4231 with Aspas and Shaq on the wings and Sturridge as the lone striker

ST- Sturridge: Daniel will defeinitely start if he is fit, but if he doesn't recover soon enough, I'd would like to see Aspas start here, with Sterling starting on the right wing..

I reckon BR will try to offload Skrtel, Spearing and Downing before the end of the transfer window in order to free up wages and transfer fees..

Subs: Reina, Kelly, Toure, Henderson, Sterling, Alberto, Borini

All in all, looks like a pretty strong team with plenty of depth with Allen, Ibe, Coady, Yesil, etc also in contention for a spot on the bench.. Whether we keep Luis or not, I still think we have a very strong squad and can finally hope to realistically challenge for a CL spot again :)  YNWA",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Your preferred starting XI for next season,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1ih5vm/your_preferred_starting_xi_for_next_season/

Does anyone feel like in the next 4 days Arsenal will up their bid to whisk him away before he reaches Liverpool? Or maybe a bid from Real may come in seeing as Cavani is now officially a PSG player?

Does anyone feel as though in recent talks between Pere, Ian and Brendan, the matter of a minimum bid was discussed in order for at least a consideration by LFC (hence the latest article with Pere suggesting of a 40 million release clause?).

Personally, I believe if Suarez reaches Liverpool on Sunday/Monday without any new bids, rumours or news on a potential transfer out, the situation will be very sensitive and handled extremely delicately IF BR is springing to retain Luis.

How do you guys think a lid will be kept on him for the next 6 or so weeks? Possibly a contract renegotiation?

&gt;[Alex Pritchard](http://mwl1967.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/alex-pritchard-v-burnley.jpg)

Position: CAM, LW, RW

Age: 20 (3 May 1993)

Nationality: English

Pritchard is an attacking midfielder who is most comfortable playing in the hole behind the striker or on the left wing. He's capable of playing deeper in midfield, but this seems to neutralize some of his effectiveness as a dribbler and a goalscorer. While at Peterborough, the right footed Pritchard played mostly on the left wing where he used his skill on the ball to either cut inside or deliver inch-perfect crosses. Pritchard's best skill is his ability to strike the ball with precision. He's an excellent freekick taker and a number of his youth goals came from set pieces. His crossing is also wonderful. So good is he as a crosser, that right now he's probably one of the best crossers of the ball that Tottenham have.

Pritchard is not fast nor strong but instead uses technical skill and a surprisingly effective burst of pace to take on opposition fullbacks. Anyone listening to Spurs vs Swindon (Friendly) will have heard how he always looked to run at a FB or CB when he got the ball at his feet and delivered an inch perfect cross to set up one of Swindon's best chances. Furthermore, in all games I have seen of him he draws a very large number of fouls/corners (I believe I counted 3 corners last night due to him), this is typically the sign of a player who can beat his man and force opposition defenders into rash or poor decisions.

&gt;Career Stats:

Championship (Posh): 6 games, 264 mins, 2 assists (Assist every 132 mins).

U21 (League, Elite group, Knockout): 11 games, 835 mins, 6 goals, 4 assists (Goal or Assist every 83.5 mins).

How do you rate Pritchard in comparison to other Tottenham youth prospects?

What are the best/worst aspects of his game?

Where do you see Pritchard in 5 years time, will he make it at spurs?

**Key moments:**

18 min - WOODWORK! A Chelsea free-kick is floated to the back post for Essien to head back across goal, but there is confusion between a defender and the goalkeeper, with the ball rebounding off the crossbar. From the resulting corner, Ramires heads the ball just wide.

22 min - Near miss - De Bruyne finds himself in space just inside the left and crashes a 25 yard effort just over the top right corner of the Singha goal.

25 min - Play halted! for a drinks break... ?

For those of you who are students and are looking for a place to stay during the school year that is not in student halls I have a spare bedroom with a second private bathroom available from September 2013 -&gt; June 2014. This is just a two-bedroom/two-bathroom flat so there would be no additional occupants other than myself.

I'd prefer a more mature student, full-time only to avoid having to pay Council Taxes. I am a Canadian enrolled full-time at Edinburgh University in the DPLP Program starting September and I have lived in Edinburgh for two years where I completed my LLB.

I am posting this for anyone who is still on the hunt for a place before everything is reoriented towards the Festival.

To avoid posting any personal information publicly I will post the link to the ad on GumTree and you can use their contact function which obfuscates your email address.

Any benefits? You live with a fellow Redditor (this can be good ... or bad I guess) and I have 80Mbit fiber Internet optimized to fuel your Reddit addiction during exams.

This is a long, painful story, so get ready.
So I finished my exams in the middle of June, and I had arranged with my mother that as as reward, I would receive the new home kit with 'Coutinho 10' on the back. So my mum (a big red, she's probably gonna read this [hi mammy :)]) goes into the sports shop picks up the new kit and goes to the till to get Coutinho on the back, and to get Carra on the back of my 2012/13 kit, as I never had a Carra kit before. Long story short, they used the wrong lettering, and it looked like the sort of cheap crap that you would get on the back of a knock off shirt on your holidays. So we had to remove the lettering with an iron, leaving a shadow on the kit where the lettering was. We got the proper BPL lettering done in a different shop, but we had to wait until last Saturday to get the kits back. On top of this, I've been to one Liverpool game, and, being Irish, I was fucking buzzing when I heard that they were playing Celtic in Dublin. Then I saw the date. It turns out I'll be leaving the country on the exact date that LFC play Celtic. Now, at this point, my mother and I are on the brink of depression, as everything we seemed to touch turned to shite. We then heard that the Liverpool reserves had arranged a game against the Crusaders, a team based in Northern Ireland. We picked up tickets in a heartbeat, and it seemed as if things were turning around. Well, my mother got a text this evening, and the game has been cancelled. So my mother had to pay twice for 18 characters on two shirts, we're missing out on the Celtic game, and we can't even see the reserves play. That, and Suarez is staring at the door, we lost Micky to Dortmund, and our transfer window seems to be at a standstill at the moment. I assume that nobody on the sub cares, I'm just using it as an outlet for my rage.

I just hope this bad luck turns around before the start of the season.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,default,"Well, I'm pissed.",0,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1ihyzd/well_im_pissed/

List of Senior Right Backs

Pablo Zabaleta   
Micah Richards   
Dedryck Boyata (also CB)

Current Questions

With Micah Richards still to sign a contract extension and Pablo Zabaleta having an outstanding year, how valuable is Micah to the squad?

With Richards the usual first choice for most of the title winning campaign, but missing much of last season due to injury, who do you expect to be first choice this coming season?

Do we have any right backs in the development team that look promising? Did Shay Facey impress you in the friendly against Supersport United?

Will Micah ever score an overhead kick?

Currently looking for hard carry.

Hello. I'm popidge. I have about 230 games worth of experience (as well as a lot of pro-scene watching), with the majority of my recent 50 as Meepo. 

I'm looking for a team to enter into the i49 quals for poops and giggles (the latter mandatory, the former only if there are no delicate lady ears present, don't want them fainting now, do we?). IF we want to go into roles, I can suck the least at offlane or farming support, can attempt hard support if bribed with hobnobs, and will mid or carry if, and only if, there are chocolate hobnobs and posh tea out of one of them fancy filter kettles involved. Or I'll Meepo. Yeah. I'll definitely Meepo. 


FUN PEOPLE ONLY. ATTITUDE PROBLEMS NEED NOT APPLY. ANY ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE ANOTHER PLAYER'S STYLE/SKILL OR FLAMING WILL NOT BE MET KINDLY AT ALL. I/WE ARE NOT IN THIS FOR THE LEET GAMER TOURNAMENT POINTS.

I'm not averse to making a team either, so If you're looking for a no-pressure, scrub-friendly lolfest for at least one weekend, then give me a shout. Although the team name will probably suck if I choose it. 

If I get a lot of people saying ""I'll make a team with you"", I reserve the right to choose based on experience, team needs, skill, choice of breaktime beverage, attractiveness of appropriate-aged siblings or bribes. 

I'll be looking to practice tomorrow and Friday night (I work until 4pm both days), and can be reached via steam: ""Popidge - ""

A lot of them have been manually updated for you, but there's still quite a few people with blank flags popping up (no easy way to batch find or fix these unfortunately!).

A couple buddies of mine and I will be doing a whirlwind tour of the UK the first 10 days of September. Some of us (myself included) are sadly new to the whole international travel scene. We will be flying into Heathrow from the US, and plan on finishing up our time in Scotland, using Edinburgh as a home base.

I noticed The Redditors' guide to Edinburgh, and took a cursory look at it. Along with that, I/we would love to hear what you all think we should do! We're all late 20s/early 30s, enjoy a good bit of history and scenic locations, matched with a great bit of quality brews/whiskeys (wasn't there some sort of famous pub crawl on Rose St, where you go into each and order a dram? Someone once told me about that, but I forget the details... I would like to actually remember my time there, and NOT be an obnoxious American tourist haha!). We will also have a car, so there is the option to head out of the city and explore/drive around to the Highlands, a distillery, or to a neighboring city like Glasgow for a day.

We'll likely look into a bed/breakfast for our accommodations, but if any you can advise us on places to stay, visit, tour, and socialize, we three would be much obliged!

This summer has been crazy with all the transfers going on all over Europe. Undoubtably our biggest signing is Jose coming back. There has been a lot of speculation over players like De Rossi and now Rooney joining us. Everyone has their own option about each which you are entitled to, but it seems like some people just don't trust Jose. Maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way, I'm not sure. Whether you like Rooney or rate him highly or not, it seems that Jose does...So why not trust the man that has three Champions League titles and brought us two league title in two years. We all want Lukaku to succeed and I have no doubt in my mind with Jose back that he will, but if he thinks we need Rooney stop talking about Lukaku's playing time. He is 20 he has time to develop with Jose and he will. Same goes with De Rossi, I love him and think that he would be a great addition to our club, but if Jose doesn't think we need him then I trust him. In the end none of this really matter because none of us actually has a say, but I just want our fan base to have absolute faith in Jose. He's not a new manage that has something to prove at Chelsea, this is Jose Mourinho were are talking about. I don't know if its newer fans that we not around for his first spell at Chelsea or not, but Jose coming back has been a dream of mine and I feel a lot of Chelsea fans since the day he left the bridge. I guess what I am trying to say is Jose Mourinho one of, if not the best and he is ours again, so trust he knows what he's doing. Again maybe I am looking at this the wrong way, I just wanted to see what others though. KTBFFH! sorry for mistakes I typed this on my phone.

I'm in search of a shared house/flat with students or young professionals and have been looking around for the past couple of days without much luck so I thought I'd ask you guys for help!

Do any of you know any good websites for finding a room to rent preferably with students or young adults between the ages of 18-24? Or have a room with I could rent? I'd prefer a double room although single would be fine and would need a place to park my car (either on the drive or outside the house).

I studied at Sheffield Hallam University and lived with student the last two years, I'm social and friendly, don't mind living with animals and would be working Mon-Fri all day. I'm looking for a house with like minded people who I could socialise with during the evenings and weekends. I do my own cooking and cleaning so no need to worry about any of that!

So, my next door neighbor is properly scum, lets call him Alan, because its his name.

Alan is the kind of generally antisocial person available in all council estates across the uk - signed off on disability due to doing too much smack when a young adult, spends time dealing drugs, hanging around in the front garden smoking joints, mending write off cars and pretty much any other dodgy money making schemes that still let him claim benefit and arse around all day.

Alan probably thinks he's not to be messed with, but its clear when the proper drug dealers come round he's very much small time.

Well, whadaya know, 12 months earlier a baby was born... not that he's let him change him, of course, and let's call this future statistic Alan junior (yes, you guessed it, because its his name). Alan jr is now the ripe age of 1, Alan, Alan jr and mrs Alan now have a house so Alan has moved into their very own council house now, leaving mrs Alan snr (his mom) living next door to me.

Of course, Alan hasn't let anything change so he's round his moms 99% of the time, how else would she (his mom) spend most of the day looking after jr while daddy gets stoned, does his dodgy deals etc.

Two days ago, (as its 30 degrees and windows have to be open) I'm awoken at 8 am by the arrival of Alan and family. Alan jr starts crying, Alan snr tells him (verbatim) to shut the fuck up. Continues to swear at the 1 year old about loosing some keys then hammers on the door of him moms house.

That was a lovely start to the day, wasn't sure it'd be topped. General use of swearing in front of child continues, just have to get used to it I suppose.

Similar today, with less issue with the keys though.

Did I mention that in the hot weather jr has been usually seen ""enjoying"" the sunshine in the front yard, completely naked whilst family sit around and smoke / fuck around with mopeds.

So, (my) wife goes out to water the plants this Afternoon, child and grandma are in front yard.

Kid (having obviously done this before) squats down, shits on the floor.

Grandma calls inside, not particularly fussed ""...gonna need some wipes...""

So r/uk - is this kind of ok, but a bit gross, or are we talking neglect / abuse and I should tell someone. Or as I'm moving out soon do I ignore it as its just bound to be hassle... 

TL:DR Neighbors are scumbags, let 1 yr old shit on the front yard, do I need to call the social?

In a recent discussion here on **/r/northernireland**, a few folks were interested to hear about how they might go about moving to New Zealand. A 5th night of rioting in Belfast seems to have been the catalyst. 

I'm not suggesting that the best way to deal with a problem is to run away from it, but sometimes distance can provide some much needed perspective. 

I originally applied in 2006, so the rules might have changed a little since then. 

First though, *work out if you’re serious*. It's a big deal moving overseas - especially if you have a partner or kids. There’s also some things that you might take for granted now that you won't have when you live thousands of miles from home.

For example, your ma and da - who will get noticeably older each time you see them. Skype is great, but it won’t replace having human contact with your family. 

Also, your wider network of friends and work colleagues.  It takes years to make a good set of friends - and don’t underestimate the importance of knowing people when looking for a job. 
Facebook/Twitter/G+ or whatever are poor substitutes for the real thing.

If after thinking about all these things you still reckon a move to somewhere far away is something you’d like to do then read on :)

New Zealand is an awesome place to live.  Very laid back people, plenty of work (in general), nice weather (most of the time) and plenty to do. However, it’s far away from everywhere - even Australia is a 5 hour flight. Also, the culture is subtly different. Can’t be more specific than that really.  Watch some Flight of the Concords - it’s a surprisingly realistic portrayal of kiwi culture...

Anyway, the best place to find out what you’ll need is the NZ Immigration website here: **http://www.immigration.govt.nz/**

There’s an eligibiliy calculator that wil let you know what your best option is, and if you can qualify at all: **https://visaoptions.immigration.govt.nz/Home/CommonPersonal.aspx**

There’s also a Skilled Migrant Points indicator to find out how many points you’d get : **https://www.immigration.govt.nz/pointsindicator/**

You need to be getting more than 100 to be considered at all, but if you get 140 it’ll be fairly easy.

A degree and relevant experience in something that there’s a shortage for is the best way to get a visa. Having a partner &amp; kids gives additional points - if your partner has a qualification you get points for that too.
BTW - the calculations talk about “recognised” qualifications. Don’t worry - all Northern Ireland schools &amp; unis are recognised. Unless you got a degree in Guatemala, you’ll be OK.

So - to apply, you need to complete an Expression of Interest.  Just create an account, fill in the on-line form and pay the fee (it was like 500 quid when I applied, no idea what it is now).

When your application has been checked by a human, you’ll be notified - and if accepted you’ll be Invited to Apply.  That’s when you have to collect all your evidence &amp; submit the physical application. You’ll get all the information you need when invited.

If it works out, you get a visa and can move to NZ - simple as that.  Took about a 10 months for me though - from initial EOI to my visa being issued.

*The most popular NZ job search websites:*

**http://www.trademe.co.nz/jobs**  (Trademe is also the best place to looks for flats and houses. It’s like a kiwi eBay)

**http://www.seek.co.nz** - good for professional jobs- computers, legal, management etc.\

**https://jobs.govt.nz/** - government jobs are usually advertised here - including medical jobs at public hospitals.

Pay is about the same I think - maybe a little less. Some things are cheaper, some things are more expensive but I think it evens out OK on average.
It’s about $2 to the pound, so a wage around 40-45k in NZ is equivalent to about 20k stg. More or less.

I really enjoyed the first part of the finale, it actually revived some emotional attachment to the show for me. So obviously when I watched the second part I was heartbroken, but overall I still think it was a pretty good ending. I LIKED the way Arthur died, same as I liked that Gwayne died. It made it all feel more real and dangerous, something the show had seriously strayed away from. I accepted that we didn't really get to see Camelot again, or that Merlin never really got his big moment. It all worked within the show in my opinion. 


What I HATED was the last 20 seconds. It implies so many things that it almost ruined the bittersweet feeling for me. If they wanted to keep the ending to Merlin himself(wich I understand, he's the reason for the show), why do it like this? 


What would've been PERFECT was just a small scene with the text like '80 years later'. Arthur's sword is back in the stone where he found it, and old Merlin is sitting there (maybe with a pipe in his mouth, looking all wise andshit). He wouldn't even need to say anything! Maybe something like 'it's time, old friend.' Anyways, it would give the same feeling the writers were going for with this ending, but imo it would be so much better!

I never thought it would be my cup of tea, I always thought it was going to have years and years of back story, years of inside information, inside jokes I'll never understand and I couldn't bring myself to watch that many seasons just to catch up with everyone.

So I gave myself a challenge. I'd watch one episode in the middle of a season, and if it's something I can follow, even from the middle of a season, maybe I'll like it.

The episode I picked?

Vincent and the Doctor. I was an absolute mess by the end of it. Tears running down my face. And I'll tell you what, that is TOUGH for a TV show to do to me. Movies maybe, TV show? Never. Fell in love with Van Gogh, fell in love with Matt Smith instantly...So now I just watched the last episode of David Tennant overlapping the first episode of Matt Smith's season and I'm hooked.

Thinking back on the parallel worlds, I've always wondered if somewhere in Rose's parallel (or really any other parallel), there's a parallel version of the Doctor flying around through time and space. On that note, he mentioned at one point that before the war, the Time Lords used to be able to travel through the parallel worlds without a problem. In that case, I really wonder if there are parallel versions of Gallifrey that's still intact, where the Time Lords are still in power and can willingly travel to any other parallel world. Does anybody know if the writers addressed this issue? If not, what are your thoughts?

Alright, so there seemed to be pretty good interest from the other thread, so I'll actually get this thing going. It's going to pretty much be new to everyone, so I'm gonna figure out how to get it going once we really get into it, but for right now, we're gonna get all the clubs figured out. This is going to strictly be on a first come, first serve basis, as far as which club you want.

I haven't actually set it up yet, so this is what I'm going to do:

For anyone that doesn't know, you can choose whatever leagues you want to include in your save. However, the more leagues you choose, the slower the game runs. So, what I'm going to do is, you can choose absolutely whatever team you want right now, however, a league has to have AT LEAST 6 teams in order for me to include it in the save. If the sign ups are wrapped up and your league has less than 6 teams, you're going to have to choose another club.

I think I set up the league online, I'm new to this as well, so if anyone wants to go on and try to join, and report back, that would be appreciated. The server name is ""rCOYS"" and the server password was ""coys"" (no quotes, obviously). I only know how to join online games, not how to have people join the ones I set up. See if anyone can figure it out and report back.

GUYS, I'M GONNA BE ONLINE MOST OF TODAY, SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M GONNA LEAVE MY COMPUTER OPEN AND ONLINE. SIGN UP WHEN YOU GET THE CHANCE. Also, I'll be in the manager chat in the game, if anyone wants to join in.

Anyway, here's the sign-up sheet.

leave the mains lead plugged in to reduce risk of happening, don't poke or do anything to the power supply aside from maybe brush vents with makeup brush etc. When you power it back up it will blow a lot of the dust out.

also keep such devices off the floor - most people realise this but some don't.

modern cellphones batteries can explode or otherwise expire in some situations, so make sure you don't leave them in direct sunlight for long, especially if you are streaming something or doing any intensive tasks.

generally check any other devices you have are not overheating or feel too hot to the touch, like sophisticated routers, firewall device anything that is plugged into the mains and turned on 24/7.

Cleaning the dust out of older systems is something you should do every couple of weeks if you are in a dusty / smoky atmosphere and feel capable of doing it, but please be careful not to damage yourself or the computer.

You will find that the power management will not activate fans etc as much if you keep things relatively dust-free.

tl:dr: Volunteer from youth led mental health project Right Here Brighton and Hove appealing for support. Hoping that you’ll spread the word to ensure we can continue to support young people. Thank you; hope I’m not distracting you from any entertaining cat photos.

A year ago, I started volunteering with the mental health project, Right Here, in Brighton and Hove. What appeals to me most about this project is that it is led by young people between the ages of 16-25, to reach out to that age group- because who could do it better than us? The decisions and choices of what the project does, how it’s done, are made by young adults, for young adults (not by a group of old professionals who wouldn’t have a clue). Run by a team of over 30 volunteers, the aim of our project is to raise awareness of emotional and mental wellbeing in 16-25  year olds, and reach out to those in need to improve their mental and emotional wellbeing. This is only possible through the time, effort and mountains of enthusiasm of young volunteers, given unreservedly. 

The determination and drive of the young people is what creates the immensely positive impact we have on the city. Yet in December, our funding will change, and we will be unable to provide the unique services we do. And so we need to get as many of you lovely people spreading the word so that our time, effort and enthusiasm will continue to have the positive impact it has had so far, and so we can carry on supporting young people across the city. Please follow this link to find out more about us: (http://right-here-brightonandhove.org.uk/)

Life is always a challenge, but it can be most challenging when growing up. What are you going to do? Where are you going to go? How do you cope with the decisions, responsibilities and situations suddenly thrown at you? Becoming an adult is in no way easy- I definitely haven’t found it so, and I’m certain most people in the same boat would agree. During this time, many of us are pushed to the brink emotionally and mentally, feeling like there is no way out, and no one to help.

Luckily, we do help and support isolated and marginalised young people. We help them build their confidence so they can take back control of their lives. Our free activities that we offer are vital in engaging with 16-25 year olds across the city; people who have lost all sense self- belief, feel uncomfortable around others, and have fallen into desperate situations. Young volunteers from the Activities Team get to decide what kind of activities take place, and by facilitating them ourselves, we can make sure they interest the people we’re trying to connect with. I’ve found it fascinating to see how something as simple and energetic as Rock climbing or Yoga can help someone rebuild their life while or after coping with mental health issues. It’s not just the fact that exercise helps create positive moods or emotions and build resilience to the bad stuff in life; its social interaction too. So many of those we work with make friends they would otherwise not have been able to make, who have shared similar experiences, and as a result we started holding social evenings at the request of those doing the activities. In this way, our free activities are a lifeline for young people with mental health issues- providing support for them in their first step towards more fulfilling lives, preventing them from slipping into circumstances that could get even worse. Please follow this link to find out more about our free activities: (http://right-here-brightonandhove.org.uk/activities/)

To help raise awareness about mental health across the city, we visit sixth form colleges such as BHASVIC and City College doing workshops and presentations about mental health. This has been really great as we’ve found that many young adults don’t know much about mental health, as it’s still a subject rarely touched on in education, and they don’t know which services they can go to. If people don’t know about it, what can they do to prevent it? In the Mental Health Promotions team, we’ve created a website: (http://www.wheretogofor.co.uk/) It’s a database which details over 100 services young people can use across Brighton and Hove, enabling all of us to find the services we need when we need them, rather than having to rely on someone else to tell us. The website covers loads of different subject areas, such as drugs and alcohol, housing, sexual health and of course mental health. This means these useful services are more accessible, empowering us to find them and use them more easily.

For most people, a Doctor is most likely to be the first professional you might turn to if you have any difficulties with your physical health. But what if you’re feeling low, anxious, stressed? In some cases, young people have had bad experiences with their GPs over mental health, and many barely visit their local surgery. We did some award winning research into whether young people would feel comfortable going to their GP about anything, and to find out what they knew about this service: (http://right-here-brightonandhove.org.uk/research-and-evaluation/gp-research/)  To be honest, I hadn’t got a clue what was confidential in a GP appointment, and wasn’t that sure that I’d even go and see a doctor about Mental health. We found that many people felt the same. To change this, we made a film: (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1cipdyVBR7c)   which gives us all the information we need to get the most out of a GP appointment, and the understanding to make an informed choice about what we do or don’t tell the Doctor. 

The team has since then been visiting Doctors Practices to see how accessible they are for young adults, and has been training staff there on how to respond to young people’s needs, and giving them information so they can help young patients. This improves the communication and engagement between both Doctors and young people. Recently, we have got involved in the design stage of a mobile app called Doc ready (http://www.docready.org/) which will enable us to record information and prepare ourselves for a GP appointment. Hopefully, we can all feel more confident in going to our doctor about our mental health, and can think more positively about seeking help. 
Another attempt to reduce the stigma surrounding Mental Health is the recent research carried out by the Research and Evaluation Team into Self Harm. It is a sensitive topic which is constantly avoided, but thanks to the research taking place through focus groups, we are able to find out more about what people know about self harm and any ways that people can help, in order to produce a guide on self harm which will be available around the city. As I’ve said before, it’s young volunteers who take charge of writing, designing and distributing the guide, which enables us to create vital tools appealing to people of our age group. Removing the stigma from mental health is one of the most important functions of Right Here, and something I feel we do well.

After that very long narrative of what we do, all I can do is emphasize how much this project means to the people it helps, and to the volunteers. So much energy and effort goes into Right Here, and because of this we’d like to make the positive impact we’re having last as long as possible . We desperately need help and support from everyone to make sure young people in Brighton and Hove don’t lose their voice for mental and emotional wellbeing. We are planning our first ever fundraising event this year: a Charity Gala Ball, the first we have ever attempted. For this to succeed we really need prize donations for the charity auction, but please, if there is any help at all you feel you can give us, don’t hesitate to contact us- we would be so grateful. You can find all our details in our plea for support: (http://bit.ly/1b5KhXk).  Please spread our message to anyone you know: friends, relatives, colleagues… anyone! The more people who know about us, the longer we can continue our work. Through some quite difficult times, it is this project that has kept me going. I really want this project to continue helping people, and from what you’ve read, I hope I’ve convinced you to want that too.

I've recently left my job working for a small company as the only employee, and opened up my own business.

I had a lot of difficulty obtaining my P45 and my past P60's, which took about 4 weeks to be done, with my boss making up a lot of excuses, when I finally got them, the figures were grossly mis-matching.
The process of starting my own business prompted me to make sure my tax affairs were in order, and so upon ringing HMRC, I find out that there is no record of me being employed for the 2 and a half years I worked there.

My payslips and my wage packets however, both show tax and national insurance being deducated from me - HMRC quickly asked me to write a letter to them detailing this and any other relevant information, but I am yet to hear back.

My understanding is that if there is no record of my being employed (based on my NI Number), then he can't have been paying my taxes.

My questions are:
*What kind of trouble is my ex employer in?
*Will this affect me personally in terms of state pension etc?
*Will there be any comeback eventually whereby I might have to pay all of that back?

The figures are somewhere around £3000 worth of tax taken from me - My previous employer used to pay me in dribs and drabs, often giving me cash straight from the till, amounting up to my wages for that month, as he wasn't making much money.

I know for a fact that he has replaced me with one part-time staffer, whom he is paying £50 a day (which is less than minimum wage), and has taken on volunteers who are working without pay.
Hopefully someone can shed some light on all of this for me, as HMRC are being rather conservative with the information they give me.",false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,null,null,self,"UK Advice please - I've had Tex &amp; NI deducted from my wages for over 2 years, but HMRC have no record of my being employed",12,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1ikkus/uk_advice_please_ive_had_tex_ni_deducted_from_my/

Jules and Verne, named after the writer, along with their pet dog Einstein. Whilst travelling through space and time with Clara and his children, exposure to his Flux capacitor has granted him special time traveling abilities including immortality..


Forward to a distant time in the future after Clara and possibly his children have died off, Doc continues to time travel and explore space in his continuously-evolving time machine travelling to new places with his now mostly robotic dog (now called Canine instead of Einstein) and his granddaughter Susan. They meet new people in their travels and new places, the future, the past..

.
A distant memory of who the Doc once was now remains, Susan has long gone, and he spends his life travelling in time with new companions until one day he meets a girl names Clara Oswin Oswald. He cannot quite bring himself to remember where he knows her from, and travels in time with her until one day she jumps through the Doc's timeline to every point of time of his to save him from an old enemy 'the intelligence'. Clara arrives in 1885 at the beginning of the Doctor's timeline and knows what she must do to save him, marry him, and send him on a journey that goes full circle.

What do you guys think?

[**William Foulke**](http://imgur.com/RIojA1k) (12 April 1874 – 1 May 1916) was a professional Goalkeeper in the late 19th and early 20th Century. Foulke was renowned for his great size (6 ft 4 in) and weight, reaching perhaps 24 stone  at the end of his career, although reports on his weight vary.


 
He moved to Chelsea in 1905 as one of [**Jackie Robertson’s**](http://imgur.com/DPDFDvz) first signings for a fee of £50. Foulke was immediately appointed Captain after having played for [**Sheffield United**](http://imgur.com/rVzsELo), twice winning the [**FA Cup**](http://imgur.com/8fhPoaK), and earning a single cap for [**England**](http://imgur.com/RFuc7yU) in 1897 against Wales. 


 
With his amazing agility in the goal, his powerful punch that sent the ball half way up the pitch, and his way of picking up the ball with one hand, Willie Foulke was halfway becoming a footballing legend. Nicknamed Variously “*Little Willie*”, “*Baby*”, and “*Big Bill*”, Foulke remarked “*I don’t care what they call me as long as they don’t call me late for Dinner*”. 


 
Chelsea made the most of his stature by putting two small boys, dressed in blue football shirts, behind the goal to throw the ball back when it went behind, the originals of the “*ball boys*” who now fetch and carry on every league ground. 


 
Chelsea played their first game in the second division on September 2, 1905. It was an away match against Stockport County, and as the team walked from the railway station to the County’s ground, Bill Foulke was accosted by a tiny urchin who piped up: “*Ye’ll get licked t’day*”. Imperturbable, grave, Foulke said very gently: “*Then it’ll be the first time this season, me lad*”.



The urchin was a true prophet. Chelsea lost the game by one goal. Stockport were given a penalty; Foulke saved the shot but the ball was returned quickly to cannon of Bob McEwan into the net.



[**Foulke**](http://imgur.com/L9X4Ma5) quickly gained a reputation for saving penalties but I will get to that further down.



Chelsea’s first Saturday home game was against the redoubtable [**West Bromwich Albion**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY-iZSIFJAk), Chelsea won by the only goal scored, the match being chiefly remarkable for the goalkeeping of Foulke who beat off coolly and easily an almost continuous bombardment of shots from the Albion forwards. Haycock, the young Albion outside-right, had never seen Foulke before and gazed at him open-mouthed with astonishment. Afterwards, describing his first run in towards the Chelsea goal when he came close quarters with Foulke, Haycock said “*When he came forward to meet me and stretched out his big arms it was as though darkness had come over the goal area*.”



During this season, the only one he spent with Chelsea, [**Foulke**](http://imgur.com/O6MbFQd) got much attention for his frequent saving of penalty shots. In a game against Burton United he saved two, calmly fielding each ball and throwing it nearly to the halfway line.



The Burton Captain spoke some words of advice to unsuccessful penalty kick taker, telling him to aim next time out of the goalkeepers reach. “Out of reach?” exclaimed the unlucky one, “*all bloody well to talk, he’s got arms as long as a blooming [**gorilla**](http://imgur.com/gallery/l8CXum5) and there ain’t more than a yard between his hands and the posts on either side*.” 



So many penalties did Foulke save that one forward, complaining the William so filled the goal mouth there was “*nothing left to aim at*,” suggested afterwards that an outline of an average-sized goalkeeper should be chalked on William, and if the ball hit outside the chalk mark it should count as a goal. 



[**Foulke**](http://origin-www.chelseafc.com/page/Legends_Details/0,,10268~1966797,00.html) finished his first and only season at Chelsea achieving an impressive 3rd place in the league having won 22 of their 38 matches. In this season, Foulke played 35 games, conceding just 28 goals. In the six games he missed that year, 17 goals were let in. William left Chelsea and joined Bradford city, where he later retired. He died of cirrhosis in May 1916 aged just 42.

I understand that during silly season, its quite common for everybody to go wild with their imagination on who they want us to sign, but I just thought that perhaps a little guideline on possible signings might be good. This is all my personal opinion though, so I hope I'm not coming off as holier than thou. 

I'll start with what a professional player tends to want. This is actually inspired by Mick Foley when he talked about 'selling out'. In no order of merit:

1. Level of competition. Players do tend to want to play in the best competitions in the world and with the best players in the world. In Europe, this means the Champions League. Also, individual leagues do count. Someone who plays for the Greek champions might be very happy to transfer to a mid-table club in La Liga, Serie A or the Premier League. 

2. Playing time. Most players would like to be able to play in the first team. Sometimes, this is due to money, as there are bonuses for playing, scoring, winning etc. Mostly, this is due to increased exposure, which will help the player get either higher profile transfers or get chosen for their National Team. The latter is especially important for players who come from countries that might contend for the Euros or World Cup. 

3. Club quality and potential for victory. I doubt there is any professional footballer who likes to lose. They tend to be competitive, and would want to win. This means that all things equal, players would prefer to play for potential league winners etc. However, the above two would still apply over this. Not many players would want to be resigned to being third choice at Real if they are really good, and sometimes playing for the winners of the Portuguese league is really incomparable with a Top 5 team from say Spain or England. 

4. Money. Let's be honest, its a job for these players. Most normal people change jobs for higher pay. It is no different for professional players. For some of them, money might even supercede the above conditions, especially if they have given up joining a real big club or if they believe the club has enough money to build a winning team from scratch (see: Monaco and PSG). 

5. Lifestyle. This is probably the least important of the conditions, but might still be important enough for some people. A language barrier can sometimes be a problem, so too can weather, city etc. For a rich person, Monaco is a really cool place to live. Manchester or Liverpool, not so much. This usually creates minimal problems, but there are many times where players who can't settle into life at a new country/city end up playing poorly. 

With this in mind, I think we should be quite selective when spelling out our daydreams for the transfer season. I mean, we'd all love having Messi at the club, but we know its not going to happen. With this in mind, what kind of players should we be looking for and have already signed according to these guidelines?

1. Playing in a lesser competition. This does not necessarily mean No Champions League. Due to the way UEFA sets up the Champions League, some clubs are regulars but almost never do well. Ajax is a great example in recent years. While it might be great for players from clubs like this to join another in the Champions League, Liverpool wouldn't be too much of a drop for them. 

2. Not seeing regular playing time. Sturridge and Coutinho fit this bill perfectly. Neither were really appreciated at their clubs, and they took the jump to Liverpool for a regular place instead of staying at their relatively high profile clubs (though Inter is in a similar situation to us despite have a more recent CL victory). In this case, younger players are a great option, as they want the chance to shine. 

3. This might sound like a big detriment for Liverpool, but actually isn't. Aspas, for example, was sort of a big fish in a small pond. Same for Mignolet. For them, Liverpool is easily a big step up. While our fortunes have dwindled in recent years, we are still a high profile team considering the number of Liverpool fans worldwide and the number of Liverpool matches that are telecast live. (I understand in many countries they only broadcast 1 match if there are more than one that kick-off at the same time. Liverpool matches regularly see broadcast time due to the fanbase.) 

5. Lifestyle. I think we lose in this case to many other clubs. Not many in their right mind would choose Liverpool over Paris, Monaco or Milan if only considering the standard of living. 

6. One more thing to add is that we can easily take on 'problematic' projects. Sturridge came with the reputation of having bad attitude. Suarez came while serving a suspension for biting and being the most hated man at the last World Cup. Aspas has a rep for being a hothead. These can be 'warning signs' for bigger clubs like Real Madrid or Chelsea, and it can be used to our advantage. While we're all sad about the PR debacle(s) that Suarez has caused us, we really aren't in a position to be too picky. 

With that in mind, I'll share my thoughts on who I think we can look at. 

Papadopoulos: We've been linked with him for a long time, and I feel that his injury problems can work to our advantage. While other clubs might shy away due to it, this could be the chance for us to swoop in. Obviously his price is an issue, but almost nobody doubts his ability. 

~~Max Kruse: Top scorer for Freiburg, who are only in the Europa league. Predominantly played as a striker, but can play on either wing. At 25 years old, this might be his big chance to go to a bigger stage.~~ Sorry Gladbach beat us to him.

Martin Harnik: Somewhat 'hidden' gem in the Bundesliga. Very dynamic right winger with a good shot. Not very good at defending though. 

Luis Muriel: There's a thread on /r/soccer right now about him, and honestly he is one of the most exciting young talents in Europe today. At 22, he is great for the future while having plenty of top flight experience with Lecce and Udinese. Has the potential to be Suarez's successor, and he can dribble and score, so he is more similar to Suarez than to Sturridge, giving us more options. 

So here are my opinions, very sorry for the wall of text. I guess the **TLDR is that due to Liverpool's situation, we have to be much more judicious when looking at transfer targets, but there are still plenty of gems for us to uncover.**",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Guidelines on signings,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1il682/guidelines_on_signings/

My dad is a doctor and need to use the line for on call work, so this isn't good enough. We had done nothing wrong. We were told to ring up after 24 hours and get our shipping and set up times moved forward but when we rang today they had cancelled our new order. We spoke to more people for a further 3 hours with no success. 

These people are morons! Any idea for help? We had done nothing, had no post and the address which cancelled our house was a totally different address. I don't understand how they can be so stupid.

I'm looking to have a change in career. I previously worked as an Administrator a few years ago but I have realised that administration work isn't for me. My anxiety makes it difficult to complete any element administration work that's communication specific things such as 'complex' or intense phone calls.

I'm looking to move to warehouse work where I know this won't be required of me. I'm not quite so anxious with face to face communication. I previously worked as a scaffolder some years ago and I also worked in another warehouse. So I do have some experience of manual work but that amounts to only 1.5 years of my total experience and my most recent and longest held job was working as an Administrator for 3 years but this was 2 years ago now. I really don't know how to explain being out of work for so long - they won't want to hear that i've been suffering from anxiety. I am also struggling with best way to explain why I want a change in work.

My CV is currently targeted at administration work so I need to change it. Do I need to explain why I've decided for a change in career on my CV or should I leave that for the cover letter?

What other things should I do to maximize my chances of getting work?

I am also beginning volunteer work helping a charity out with their stock. Do you think I should start hunting for work once I've gained some recent experience?

If you've got any other suggestions that would be great also

Thanks!

I don't think we need to make a marque signing to push forward. we don't need an erikson or a david villa or anything. we have a top four squad. we just need depth. we need young guys to come from the academy or to be brought in that will support this team we have. I would like us to get a left back and a defensive mid as back up but that is all I think we need. I am soooo looking forward to this season. 

my thoughts on who we should bring in.... 

cricito - zenit (really good left back who is out of contention) 

luis Gustavo - Bayern (looks to be out with pep coming in) 

coentrao - Madrid (might be sold now that mourinho is out)

pepe - Madrid (I could see him being out and his ability to play as a backup dm could help)

I'm looking to build up a small nest-egg which will steadily grow to provide a bit of passive income as I get older. Is a S&amp;S ISA right for me, or is there something else more suitable? I would be looking to invest in one linked to the FTSE 100 or similar.

She explained the journey and how it would come to around £45

She said she was a nurse showed her ID and text her name and number to my phone. I have her £50 from a cash point and text her my bank details for her to transfer the cash.

It's 2 days later and I've heard nothing, I've tried calling the number just now but there was no answer. Was I naive? I kind of feel like I'd rather have faith in people and be proved wrong occasionally than be cynical and be right all the time.

What are your thoughts?

************UPDATE***************

I called her this afternoon and she promised she would return the money this evening. It still hasn't arrived, I've reported this to the police and got a crime number. 

I've been getting ribbed all day by people at work for my naivety. Apparently she does this quite often in the area where I was, I'm tempted to lurk around there and confront her. Can I just grab her and place her under a citizens arrest?   

***********FURTHER UPDATE***************

Police have popped round, she does this all the time, at least 6 other people have reported her, they know who she is but haven't been able to arrest her, they know some of her addresses but she is never there. If they catch her they'll want me to pick her out of a line up. 

Feel like a total mug

************SUPER FURTHER UPDATE*****************

They caught her, I got a call today and a letter (how do I upload pics) her name is Helena Seed, she has done this before and was jailed back in January (ALREADY OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/leeds-woman-jailed-for-good-samaritan-travel-pass-trick-1-5321949

I am really at my wits end and am therefore turning to Reddit as a last resort. 

I recently graduated from University but managed to get a D in my final module which has turned my First class honours into a 2:1. 

If I had come from a prestigious Uni I probably wouldn't complain but my Uni isn't that well regarded academically and I am also confused as to why I have got a D. 

Has anyone had any luck appealing their marks? 

From my assessment regulations I have noticed that I can not appeal on the grounds of being dissatisfied with my results and can only appeal if I can find: 

&gt;That there was a material error, either in the conduct of the &gt;assessment itself, or in the proceedings of the Assessment Board, &gt;which materially affected the Assessment Board’s decision.

I really don't want to come across someone who thinks that they are better than they are but I have really been disappointed with my last year and frankly don't think it was worth the money that I paid for it. 

The icing on the cake was that when I email my course leader to ask about appeals his reply was simply:

&gt;The first step is t contact quality, I think….

And this is supposed to be the person that offers me guidance on such matters! 

I suppose this is part rant part hope that someone will have a solution but it seems that I am just stuck. ",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Looking to appeal University result...,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1imizk/looking_to_appeal_university_result/

My offering, is an odd story. I went to a boarding school in the eighties. It was in an old spooky house in the middle of nowhere and had its ghost stories, which were shared enthusiastically. Being about eight years old and not having much of a sceptical filter yet, most of us believed them.

The other thing that helped to convince us the place was haunted, were the screams we'd hear at night... Not every night, and infrequently, but with some regularity.

No, this wasn't the deputy head knobbing the matron, or anything like that, but loud, anguished screams.

We told the matron and other staff about this, but were hushed up and the matter brushed away.

Much, much later, when I was in the sixth form, this was brought up with another teacher, who offered an explanation. The french teacher, who was in his 70s, who had a room in the school, suffered from terrible nightmares, and it was him that we heard screaming, not any sort of spook or spectre. It turns out, that, because he was bilingual (which is also how he ended up as a French teacher, clearly) and in his 20s or 30s during the war, he'd been placed in SOE in occupied France. The nightmares were apparently because he'd been discovered by a single German soldier, with a morse radio, and they'd fought and he'd strangled the German to death with the headphones. 

This teacher - I won't name him, but I do remember his name well - wasn't exactly a great educator, and was an overweight, chainsmoking wreck of an individual, had actually been a spy who'd killed a Nazi with his bare hands. And it haunted his nights even forty years after. 

He wasn't exactly an inspiring or great teacher, but when we had it all explained to us, well, respect was due.

Anyone got anything else?

It seems conspicuous that we've now gone a fair few weeks without any real Liverpool-instigated transfer activity (ie seeking players) - the last attempt being Mkhitaryan. From my last check, Rodgers was hinting that during this period we would still be looking at options. Here's three guesses at what's going on

* The long game. Although we've done well in getting signings earlier in the transfer window, this mid-window period could be seen as an expensive time to buy players. As the money-rich clubs pay well over the odds for players (I'm looking at you PSG and Monaco) - everything seems inflated. Madrid expect 40M for Higuain, we're expecting £55m for Suarez, etc. Perhaps we're waiting for the end of the window when some clubs might be more desperate to cash in their players and be willing to sell for less.

* A question of Suarez. Although Rodgers' recent comments are encouraging in terms of keeping the player, the club need to be ready in case a large bid does come in. That might mean keeping tabs on potential replacements but nothing by way of approach (in case it increases price should Suarez sell for lots). 

* We're done for the window. If Suarez does stay, we may well be done for the window. Although we could all identify some areas of improvement, the management might think they're not worth investing in, unless a particularly appealing situation arose (like Papadopoulous buying property in Ormskirk for no apparent reason). 

* We're keeping things well under wraps. There might be approaches and bids made, but the club's done well to keep the deals under wraps and there's been no contact made with journalists

Benteke has managed two great seasons these past two years.  He scored 16 goals in 32 appearances with Genk before leaving for England, where he scored 19 times in 34 matches for Villa.

He's [handed in a transfer request at Villa](https://twitter.com/SkySportsNews/status/354354677221036032), and reportedly [fancies a move to Tottenham.](https://twitter.com/Danny83bear/status/354522585431683072)

Here is a video of his goals from last year for Villa, with a few of his goals for Belgium thrown in.

Links to his [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Benteke) and [Tranfermarkt](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/benteke/profil/spieler_50201.html) pages.

Questions:

* Do you think he's worth the reported 25m+ that Villa are demanding?

* What price do you think is fair?

* Do you think he can provide the 20 or so goals we need from our number 1 striker?

* What do you think the strengths/weaknesses of his game are, and how do you think they would effect his ability to settle into the squad?

* Finally, does his apparent willingness to request a transfer to a better club worry you?

If you have anything else to add, feel free.  These questions are just designed to get the discussion going.

I don't know what the previous tenants' situation was and the landlord has told me nothing about this stuff (I've had to uncover my other service providers on my own initiative)  but I would have thought that it would be up to me to either stay with the gas supplier they had, or to switch to one of my choice. The Meter Point Reference people have told me that since there's no current supplier, I can opt for one of my choice, but my real question is... what might be the consequence for not doing that? If there's no record of a current supplier, does that mean the previous tenants didn't ever register (they were here for 3 years, I think)?

I live above a commercial business on an A road; there are two other flats in the building. Could the gas be routed through the business? I've got an active gas meter in a cupboard in my flat; I've only seen it go up when I've got hot water on, or the hob/oven.

Lastly, if I do register with a provider, does anyone have any recommendations? I'm in London, if that helps.

The rest are common sense. 

Today in Austin, Texas, it is 28C.. This is actually pretty cool for us. We're accustomed to 37C to 40C during the hottest summer months. (June through around September) 

1. Box Fans. &amp; Swamp Coolers
You can normally find these in hardware stores, or big box appliance retailers.. I realize that due to the heat wave, everyone and their cousin is probably stocking up on these things right now. They're usually around $10 here, I'm going to guess they're around 20£. 

Big blocks of ice are typically hard to come by, but what I like to do around the house, is get a cooler, or in worst case scenario, a bucket. Fill the cooler or bucket up with ice, and then set the box fan up, such that it is blowing air across the ice. This is basically a swamp cooler.. It's not as good as A/C but it will cut the heat enough that you can function. 

Bonus technique..: The worst part about a heat wave is trying to sleep through it at night. This is a slightly crazier technique but if it's so hot out you've ditched you're sheets, and you're staring at the ceiling praying for death.. It might be the option you've been looking for.. 

Set up your wall o' box fans (2-3, or how ever many box fans you have), such that they are at the height of the mattress you're going to be sleeping on.. you want to position the fans so it's going to blow air directly over you.. Then, instead of ice (which is often hard to get in the middle of the night) you take your top sheets off the bed, and haul them into the bath tub, and soak them. Then wring out the sheet so that it is damp, but not so that it is dripping. then throw it back on the bed like you normally would.. 
- It feels a little wierd at first to be trying to get under a wet sheet, but if you get as hot as I do, you'll drift off to sleep in about 5 minutes.. You may have to re-soak the sheet every 4 hours or so.. but at least that's 4 hours of sleep you didn't have before..

2. Water. 
Sort of an extension of the above.. Cold Showers, Cold compresses, bandanas; Cool all the parts of the body that traditionally radiate heat. Hands, Feet, neck, head.. Cool water baths for your hands &amp; feet.. For your neck or head, I like taking a 20oz water bottle, and freezing it solid. Then I wrap a towel around it and put it behind my neck. For my head, I'll get a towel and soak it in water.. wring it out so it's still damp (but not dripping) and wrap it around my head. Especially good for sleeping.

3. Altitude.. 
I'm not sure what your living situation is, but basically the lower in your house you can get the better. If your bedroom is on the 2nd floor, relocate to the 1st floor or basement for the duration of the heat wave. Hot Air Rises.. 

4. Hydration.
Drink water til you pee clear. Maintain that level. Add some electrolytes because invariably you're sweating some out. 
Avoid Caffeine (ya'll have decaffeinated tea right?, and alcohol as both these things can lead to further dehydration) You might take a momentary step in to Brit-heresy, and consider Iced Tea instead of hot.. (please don't burn me at the stake for suggesting this..)

5. Public Places..
If there's a library, or movie theater or similar large commercial location, they probably have massive HVAC systems. Use them. 
Even if only for 30min to get out of the heat.. World of difference.

6. Food
Smaller meals, with more veggies. Basically anything with a huge amount of meat protein, or carbs is going to cause your body to generate more heat as it breaks down those food types. Skip the steak, have a salad.. 

7. First Aid.. 
You're going to see heat related health issues.. Either at home or at the office, or even in the street. Heat Stroke, Heat Exhaustion, and Dehydration. All can be potentially lethal. I've seen one guy literally go batshit nuts from dehydration.. Ranting and screaming..
I won't list all the symptoms here, but hop on over to WebMD, and look up the symptoms. 

8. Wet-T-Shirts..
Classic cotton T-shirts.. Soak em' just like the sheets. 
Cools your core tempature right down. 

9. RedNeck Heat Shields..
Get yourself a roll of tin foil, or aluminium however it is ya'll pronounce it. Using cardboard as a backing, wrap the foil around the front of the card board sheets and block out your windows. The foil reflects the heat of the sun, and the cardboard provides a little positive insulation against the  heat.. Sure this turns your house into something akin to a fall out shelter or cave, but at least you're cooler inside...

10. Creepy cat lady shades..
Open your windows, but lower your blinds.. You get some air flow, but the bulk of the light &amp; heat stays outside.

11. Breeze Ways.. 
You may have to experiment on which doors and windows to leave open, but if you've ever had a window open, and the front door open at the same time.. and go to shut the door, only to have air pressure slam the door for you.. You know what I'm talking about.. 
You want to create a path through your home that encourages air flow.. This is only going to help some of you..

12. Siesta.. 
Texas, especially south texas is deeply rooted in hispanic culture. One of the best traditions we embrace is the Siesta. (admittedly it's harder and harder to do during the working days in the US, I still sneak out during the mid-day hours for a nap when I can get away with it.) Basically it's a well timed nap. Escape the heat of the day by lazing around the house for an hour or two during the 12-2pm hours.. The hottest times of the day. 

I hope this listing helps..

Maybe we can get the Reddit Gift Exchange guys mobilized to ship UK Redditors box fans or something..

Edit: Reddit formatting screwed up my numbering.. Oh well.. you're worth two #1's. 




EDIT:
Pet/Child Warning: UPDATE FROM: /u/WishIWereHere
**DO NOT LEAVE CHILDREN OR PETS IN TURNED OFF CARS.** They will die. I'm not even joking. I know you guys don't depend on cars as much as we do here so this may not apply to you, but still, the temperature inside a car sitting in the sun can get really hot.

The study found that even at 9 a.m. with an outside temperature of 28 degrees, the closed automobile registered 43 degrees inside. When the outside temperature rose to 44 degrees at 1:30 p.m., the closed vehicle reached 51 degrees. 

Even just a few minutes isn't ok. If you see a child or an animal inside a locked unattended car, seriously consider calling the police, because no joke, they can die.

EDIT:
Heat Stroke/Heat Exhaustion first Aid tips from:/u/Synthetic_Sound
Hi there - fellow Austin-ite here. I just wanted to add that one of the more common, and sometimes overlooked symptoms of heat exhaustion/stroke is the ""train"" feeling - you begin to hear a ""roaring"" in your ears, and will feel quite dizzy all of a sudden. If this happens - take it seriously. Find shade and drink water immediately. Oh, also, this is going to sound strange, but don't drink ice water. Try drinking it at room temperature, or just below. It will cool you down faster, and won't send your body into shock (so to speak). This is especially important if you're feeling the effects of heat exhaustion or stroke. Plus, if you're super dehydrated and you drink something really cold, you're pretty much guaranteeing yourself a massive headache if you drink it too fast.

If you're feeling extra hot, take a cotton ball, dab it in rubbing alcohol, and run it across the back of your neck. I have no idea how or why this works - but it's a pretty quick method of cooling yourself down at least temporarily.

If y'all have any other questions or such, I'll be around for awhile! Best of luck everyone :)

I feel slightly embarrassed to admit it, but I'm a regular on a TV show in Asia where we talk mostly about things in our countries of origin.

I'm writing up an episode on fads in the UK, but it's been so long since I've been in the UK that I have no idea what's popular.   

I'd appreciate any help you could give me!  The questions are:

1) What strange things have been popular in the past?
(I'm thinking about answering with planking and hysterical paroxysm)

2) What food or drink fads have been/are popular?

3) What 'recreational' fads have been/are popular?

Well, that’s not true. It’s depression. But everything is so conflicted that you don’t know anything about your life anymore. You got out of the hospital about a month ago, and you were supposed to be recovering but now you just want to kill yourself even more. You’re useless. It’s useless. You lay in bed. You walk around your house looking, needing for something to enjoy. But you can’t find it anymore. Even the air is drained and apathetic. It’s thick, everything is thick. The brightest days are overcome with the darkest nights, and the brightest moon is covered by the grayest clouds. There is no moon, even that has disappeared. It’s dull. It’s all dull. You know what’s the worst though? Within these months, you’ve lost your personality. You can’t find yourself, because the who you were before disappeared along with the happiness. Now you’ve been faking it. Well you were. What’s the point of faking now. Lose your personality, you lose your friends. Basic math. So that happens, and you’re alone. There.Is.Nobody.Home. Not a single person to talk to. The one person who is going through the same thing as you isn’t even able to take care of herself. You have nothing. You’re wasted. You’re a waste and you can’t even write this novel you need for your graduation project. You’re a waste of space and you can’t do anything. You fucking suck. Nobody is there for you because nobody wants to be there for you. And then when you try to be there for yourself, nothing comes out. That voice in your head, the one that always tell you things you need to hear? He’s gone. He left you because he got bored. You’re boring. Nobody likes the boring. Nobody wants to be bored. Look in the mirror. Go ahead, look in it. It’s empty. You look at this reflection but all you see in a stale picture of a stale face. It’s dead behind those shitty brown eyes. Who the fuck are you staring at? What the fuck, are you staring at. Haha, hell, you can’t even cry. You’re so useless you can’t cry. The world doesn’t want your tears. Nobody does. Get lost. Go back to the basement, and collapse. Collapse onto the floor with blood spilling out of your thoughts. Your thoughts. They’re bleeding. Get a fucking bandaid you dumbass. Sleep. This has been happening for the last few months of your life. You’re gone, and you want to get rid of the last parcel of waste that exists in this happy shining world you don’t belong in. You want to swallow those pills. You don’t have the guts. You wish you did.

Then one day you’re watching the Philip Defranco show, and he starts talking about this show called Doctor Who. You’ve never really heard of it before, it’s just another one of those sci-fi shows that nobody watches except the sci-fi freaks but you don’t really talk to them. But except Philip DeFranco’s a cool guy. He must watch cool shows. And you’ve been looking for a new show to watch for awhile. Something to fill the void that Lost left. Goddamn you miss that show. Well, I’ll try it.
So you do. And before you know it, you’re in love. What the hell is this show? You don’t even like sci-fi, but this is really good. And you’re past the first season. At this point, you’re in it because the writing is excellent and the plotlines and dialog are incredible. And, what the hell, it’s something to drag the days out. And then David Tennant comes along. Oh David Tennant. You didn’t really understand what just happened, the shift in actors. But you’ve read about it before, and okay, it’s not that big of a deal. You’re a little hesitant, but it’s alright. After two seasons with David Tennant, you’re no longer just in it for the writing but suddenly you find yourself captivated by the characters. You’ve never been so emotionally attached to fiction in your life. You find yourself idolizing the Doctor. You become his character. You want to be him. You see the Doctor and the way he’s witty and intelligent and funny, and he just enjoys himself. He smiles behind deep eyes, but there’s more. There’s so much more. He’s who you want to be, after all of what you’ve been through, this is where you would like to come out. And your words. You want to use your words like he does. He can persuade or frighten anything with his incredible speeches. And he just forms plans. Sometimes. Other times he wings it. But everything is done with such a sense of enjoyment and purpose. And then there are the burdens he carries.

In spite of longstanding and deep emotional burdens and a soul weighed down by his 
past, has found a way to let the best parts of his personality shine through—his warmth, 
his humor, his creativity. He still shines, despite all the shit that makes him not want to. He’s lost so many things and seen so much that you wouldn’t believe. But he’s still so happy. He’s still so happy. You start carrying this around. And adopt all of this into your own personality and suddenly, people enjoy you. People are enjoying your presence and who you are and you’ve found a face in the mirror that shines back. All because you’ve been moved by such a captivating character. And now when you feel like shit, you turn on an episode and smile at the amazement. In my darkest times I like knowing that I can put on an episode and forget about the world as I watch my favorite fictional idol save an entire species just by using his brain. That is why I love this show. It changed my life, and it’s safe to say I wouldn’t be who I am today if it weren’t for the show. Especially the 11th doctor. He was the most idolizing of them all. I think I took most out of his personality. This show helped me through the darkest time of my life and I am forever indebted to its incredibility.

I'm a 22 year old guy in North England. I've dropped out of University twice (combination of mental health issues, and it not being the right course). I've had a total of one job in my entire life for a year back in 2010, and a couple of weeks working as cover back in 2007. I've pretty good A Levels, but pretty naff subjects (A's in Art, English, and Sociology. Urgh.). I've no real skills that I can think of; competency at Photoshop and photography, and my writing it pretty up to scratch, but apart from that...

I've been unemployed now since January, when I dropped out of Uni. Been sitting at home doing fuck all for the past few months.

A major barrier to getting the motivation to properly find work is that I feel suicidal 'bout 15% of the time, and the other 40% is moderate (diagnosed) social anxiety. I'm going to counselling, but it's not really doing much.

I feel like I've wasted my life, and that I've got no options left. I can't go back to University: I can no longer receive any funding and can't afford it myself. I've around £11,000 in savings which is locked away, and about £500 in my current account. I rely off my partner for financial stuff; but he's on a minimum wage and can barely support both of us. Moving back home ain't an option (and theres even less work and support there).

I've been exploring heavily the idea of an apprenticeship, but most of them are stuff like NeXT Warehouse stockers or administrative assistants. I've applied for quite a few; been rejected every time.

I've been thinking at volunteering, but that wont solve the money side of things, and can't see how it'd help in the long run. Besides, I'd be pretty dire at over-the-counter stuff.
I'm finding it so tough to get the motivation up to learn new skills. I tried to learn some web design earlier this year, but it was utterly mentally exhausting.

So, with a low skillset, no experience, and pretty much constant depression: what can I do to get better? I want to get better; but right now the Light At The End of the Tunnel seems non-existent. I can't find a way out of this slump.

What avenues could be open for me? Ideally I want something that can pay enough that I don't have to rely on handouts. I'm too scared to go to the Job Centre, too many horror stories there..

I can feel my partner getting more and more frustrated with me. We argue nearly every day now, and I know we're both incredibly unhappy how life has turned out.

A possibly windfall is that I might be getting some money to put towards a house in a few months (grandparent dying, and all that...), but I feel that getting a place would just cement me down to the ground, and provide me with even less motivation to get up and change things. I'd love to set up a business, but.. I'm too scared.

Also the Saturday before, but mainly the Sunday...

### General info
I've been speaking with the lovely staff at [Meltdown](https://www.facebook.com/MeltdownLondon) about organising the UK pubstomp for TI3. Meltdown is a [short walk from Kings Cross](http://goo.gl/maps/VsO9v) (the bar formally known as Prince) and is kitted out with some very nice machines so we should have the opportunity to watch games from within the Dota 2 client.

The good news is that as well as Meltdown showing Dota on the Saturday from 1700-&gt;0130 they've got their hands on a late licence for the Sunday which means we can hang out and celebrate from 1700  until the first trains home in the morning (I'll update post with the exact time they'll keep the bar open to but the quote I have so far is that the licence should ""cover until the finals are over"")

### Accomodation
If you're looking for somewhere cheap to stay your best bets are either to find a hostel (~£20 and up) or to split a hotel room with other people (~£40 each and up). Use the below thread if you're looking for people to split a hotel room with, and ensure you state whether it's for Saturday, Sunday or both nights. Also realise that the games will finish between 3am and 6am on the Sunday according to valve, and by 6am the Monday trains will be running again so it may be easier to just pull an all nighter and head straight home if you plan on watching all the way to the finals!
Hostels near kings cross:

* [Hostel170](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/92859/arr/2013-08-10/ngt/1/ppl/1/) is £23/night
* [Keystone Hostel](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/88749/arr/2013-08-10/ngt/1/ppl/1/) is £26/night

### Extra events
## Cosplay competition
Back in my day it was called fancy dress, but whatever it's called I'm happy to bribe people to dress up as their favourite Dota hero for the Sunday! Prizes will be a choice of either something from my Dota 2 inventory or funded by my steam wallet. Post below if you're interested so I can work out how big I need to make the prize pool!
## Free Dota themed quiz
From 1730 (games start 2000) I'll do a dota themed pub quiz - in theory a player of any experience will be able to answer any question! Either some more steam based prizes to the winning team or a few free pints.

A chum of mine and I have decided that we need to go walking along rivers and across crumbly hillside tops, seeing the sites that are off the well beaten track and attempting to sleep in a couple of baking hot tents every night - in the South West: Cornwall and Somerset.

I have this foolish image of stone circles in the morning, five or ten miles later a dip in a waterfall or spring, sleep in a campsite five miles further on. Coastal walks. Sun burn. Mosquito bites. River trails and  arguments, hardy hikes across what appears to be pointless skree but has a lovely view at the end of it. Then another campsite.

If you agree with me that it is in no way in our interests to sell off these services, especially into what is effectively a monopoly. Please sign the petition and if you support it...maybe share it around and try to get a lot of signatures for it.

Thanks.

I have some software that works with buzzers that is moderately configurable.
I can swap out some graphics and sound files that are currently just plain screens and beeps and boops to pictures of the doctor and perhaps a quick sound clip.

If you know of any clips where the doctor (old AND new series.. as we will probably play trivia games based upon each)  where he says “right, correct, wrong, incorrect” .. anything I can use, I’d appreciate it.

It made its money through fisheries/tourism in the early 20th Century and all was good.

During the 90s and into the 00s, as a teenager, I watched as the town became over run with tourists, particularly Londoners. More and more houses that had been family homes to several generations were snapped up for second homes and are occupied maybe 6 weeks of the year. The general image of Southwold increased exponentially and the rent of the shops on the high street sky rocketed. 

A lot of these shops were the usual high street shops - bakery, fish mongers, butcher, pharmacy, green grocers etc etc... They can't afford the rent and were bought by the big chains - Tesco, WHSmith, Jack Wills, Fat Face... The high street is now like every other high street and the tourists are bored of it.

So here's what grinds my gears - if you find a nice, quaint, unspoilt town and want to use it as your holiday destination for a few years: that's fine. We'll gladly take your money. However, appreciate that you are grinding it into the ground and your complaints that it has 'lost its charm' to any locals will really not go down well.

Apologies for grumble - but I'm curious, is this the case in other places around England/UK? If so, what are locals doing to re-claim their town?

TL;DR - I'm a grumpy local who hates Londoners.

Line up: Mignolet, Johnson, Enrique, Agger, Toure, Lucas, Gerrard (C), Alberto, Downing, Coutinho, Aspas.

Subs: Jones, Assaidi, Henderson, Spearing, Allen, Borini, Sterling, Kelly, Skrtel, Flanagan, Wisdom, Robinson, Ibe.

**Kick off:** The Indonesians are pumping out a boss You'll Never Walk Alone. Numerous flares are in sight, *no pyro, no party*.

**GOAL! 9 mins:** [After some good build up, a couple of lucky bounces puts Coutinho through and he slots past the keeper well!](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3762/9325627707_eaefb8ff82_o.gif) 1-0 to the Red Men!

**29 mins:** Alberto with a lovely shift and shot onto the crossbar.

**31 mins:** Mignolet's first real piece of work, makes a fine stop from Van Dijk's long range effort. He then parries the resulting corner.

**Half time:** It's 1-0 Liverpool, we've been dominant.

**Half time subs:** Allen for Gerrard | Robinson for Enrique.

**54 mins:** Aspas rounds the keeper but a disgusting bobble forces his shot high. Still 1-0.

**64 mins subs:** Borini for Aspas | Skrtel for Toure | Wisdom for Agger | Hendo for Lucas | Kelly for Johnson | Sterling for Coutinho | Ibe for Downing | Assaidi for Alberto.

**71 mins:** Borini misses his kick and Sterling's follow up strike clips off the bar.

**GOAL! 87 mins:** [Ibe bursts past one with pace that would make Usain Bolt glaze in awe, slides through Assaidi who in turn squares to Sterling.](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5481/9328758850_9f1d8ba2f2_o.gif) 2-0.

**Full time:** Could've and should've scored more but finishing was poor. Nonetheless a good performance and ultimately good we didn't push it too hard with Melbourne midweek.

I cycled into central london with no problem. weather was good, traffic was ok. but when i got to my destination, i hit a snag, i didnt know where the nearest bike rack is. I spent 10 minutes circling around just to find a decent proper place to find somewhere to park my bike.

a) why not stick it on a railing? some places dont allow that. plus, those places may not be secure. Not to mention, im a proud law abiding citizen, not some punk. I'd rather walk a bit to put my bike in a proper place.

b) 10 mins walk? pffft, you're lazy!. Well, maybe i am! but this is the age of information overload. if we can get daily updates about some royal's pregnancy development, why not use that same infrastructure for somethign that might actually benefit someone.

So, my plan is this. a) I want to learn how to actually collate this data. Im thinking a subreddit with some kind of modifiable google map or something. b) People can contribute to the project by taking a pic of the bike rack, putting the location on the modifiable map. the more the merrier! think of it as a domesday book of bike racks c) london benefits. enough said. this is a good chance to contribute to our lovely city.

I cant do this alone. and i'm not looking to benefit from this is anyway. I merely saw a problem, and would love some feedback/ volunteers

Dunno where else to post this so here it goes:

I've spent nearly a year in the UK now and nowhere have I ever found ice tea without sugar such as [this](http://imgur.com/AAlz3Sq). I *really* like that sort of drink, though. I enjoy a cool, sweet soft drink (without fizz) and would like to avoid the sugar not only because of the calories but also because of the taste and the fact that it leaves me more thirsty.

So what's the deal? Why doesn't this seem to exist in the UK?
I only ever see sugar sweetened ice tea. Everywhere I looked, which includes: Sainbury's, Tesco, Morrison's, Scot-Mid, Lidl, Aldi. I would've hoped that at least the last two had my precious ice tea since they are German and I come from Germany.

Any idea on where in the UK I could get ideally that specific brand of ice tea?

They are short of O-Negative blood in particular, but they are welcoming all donations as stock is seriously low. 

The Welsh Blood Service relies on 350 donations per day at least throughout the country to cope with demand in hospitals. Without stock, well, you can imagine the trouble hospitals are going to face. Elective and emergency surgery will suffer the most. 

Here is a chart of how much blood stock they currently have in Wales. B-Pos and and AB-Neg are at their lowest (2 days worth in the whole country) and A-Pos and B-Neg types have only 3 days left stock. The rest have a week or less.

To find out if you are eligible for blood donation take this quick test.

You can find out where to donate here. There are saturday clinics in a lot of places.

I am going early next week to the WBS place in Pontyclun to donate and I urge you all to, also. My brother recently received a blood transfusion through an emergency operation and I am thankful for the people who donated an hour of their day to do it, they saved a life.

I saw a ned or two, and a beast of a man with a pitbull type thing (who actually moved aside to pass me in the street, though). But I never felt scared or threatened there.

I just came across this subreddit and thought I'd do a little more research about the area I'll be living in. I noticed Stobswell was mentioned quite a few times as one of the rougher areas, which I expected. But I also noticed Morgan St and Park Ave singled out more than once for being the worst bits of it. My flat is adjacent to both of these streets, and I'll have to use them every day to walk into town.

No, I don't think so.. Similarly, Downing notched around 4 goals and 3 assists?(I'm not too sure) which us Liverpool fans were quick to point out, was more than Young, Valencia and Nani combined.. 

However, consider Downing's positives: a good work-rate and decent crossing.. His negatives include: Age, English nationality(just kidding :D), a lack of pace, Coutinho-esque vision and dribbling ability, and mediocre finishing.. Now, are a good work ethic and OK crosses enough to make up for the aforementioned weaknesses? I would respond with an emphatic NO. As shown in many matches, especially the recent friendlies against Preston and Indonesia where he was up against relatively weak opposition, Downing failed to present much of an attacking threat, finding it difficult to beat players or get into dangerous positions and having to pass sideways or backwards more often than not.. 

Looking at BR's style, he likes his wingers to play as inside forwards(Sterling, Ibe) or advanced playmakers(Coutinho, Suso).. Downing is neither.. He is an old-fashioned winger who hugs the touchline and whips crosses in.. However, looking at our current forward line: Aspas, Suarez, Borini, Sturridge, none of them are particularly dominant in the air and prefer the ball on the ground.. Downing is now ~28 and will probably fetch a higher transfer fee now than in 1 or 2 years time.. I know he has a good attitude and is passionate but nowadays, you need to be fairly technical to excel and Downing just isn't.. Liverpool FC need promising, talented players like Coutinho and Ibe to see themselves competing in the Champions League sometime soon and Downing simply isn't good enough for a top European team(or even an aspiring one)..

This is all based on my opinion and may be wrong.. What do you think, is Downing good enough? Should Liverpool keep him?  ",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,My opinion on Stewart Downing,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1iqbk1/my_opinion_on_stewart_downing/

I am sure you have seen a million post from the colonies asking what should I do? Well, I am asking that again. Have patience with me, remember, I am from the colonies! ;) 
My husband and I are arriving in Glasgow at the end of August and eventually making our way to London. We will spend the last three days in London and then head back home.
I have spent some time in Scotland, but my husband has not. We are planning on playing it by ear, except for London. We have nothing booked besides the car. 
So my questions are:

1. Where should we visit? Any amazing small towns, should not pass up cities, or you have to see castles? I am not sold on visiting Stonehenge, should I block some time to see it?

2. Any hotels that blew you away that we should go out of our way to stay at?

3. Driving. I have never personally had to drive in another country (other than US &amp; Mexico.) Being from Texas an hour drive is average for me to get anywhere. I am used to driving hours at a time to visit anything outside of my city. My question is, is it unreasonable for me to think that we could make the drive from Glascow to London within 8 hours? 

4. Any events/festivals going on during the first two weeks of September that we should attend?

5. I would like to visit Clun and the Clun Castle any recommendations in the area?

Thank you for reading another travel post &amp; thanks for any help!

Edit: I added 5.
Edit: We are back, and I am beyond grateful for everyone's suggestions. We had such a wonderful time. Thank you again! Here are a few of my favorite pictures. Warning, they are blurry. I used my phone for all of them! [Great Britain Adventure](http://imgur.com/a/ONKWh)

My significant other comes from another country in Europe where she now works full time there so I would like to move there to be with her.

Now my company has a policy that you can live anywhere in Western Europe as long as you are a Supervisor or Superintendent and will then pay for all commuting costs on a normal contract with benefits.

As a Sub Engineer or Pilot, you can only move abroad if you take a 'day-rate' contract (where you lose the benefits like the pension plan) and have to pay for all commuting costs yourself.

Is this allowed or is this discriminatory in some way? I'm not sure and I personally feel it should be a time-served rather than a grade that is used to decide whether someone is allowed.

I was sleepy from getting up so early and could only see half of the stage and I thought oh well at least I'm here.

I wasn't excepting to see much and so after the little video about how the doctor couldn't get tickets and that he had this ticket that would swap two people in the hall for the Doctor and Clara.However,the two people who were the the hall will be a couple of blocks away naked! That caused a lot of laughter and with that the video ended and silence came over everyone.

Suddenly a spot light flashed over part of the orchestra and then a massive cheer broke out I could just about see Matt and he yelled hello and came down to the front near to where the stage was and after a bit oh hello, why am I in the choir Jenna came down claiming she couldn't play the double base. Matt's hair was a topic and he acted shocked and claimed it was the ticket and that someone is now naked in London with some really nice hair. Matt also decided to have a go on a piano and conduct the orchestra before running off sating to Jenna last we time knew you. You were a dalek and with that ran off.

The music continued and it was all stunning in the first half before the break and there were monsters in the first half there was sliurans,slience,cybermen,weeping angels and judoon there were probably more but I can't remember what order every monster came in. The highlight of the first half though has to be the ""I Am The Doctor"" it was just perfect and during every song clips from the matching episode to the music would be shown on massive screens dotted around the hall. During the prom we had our own hosts which were madame Vesta and Commander Strax during their introduction someone  decided to have a crack at Madame Vesta and whistled at her in that high pitch which I can never describe and again laughter ensued. The final song was the rings of Akhaten which was sung by the Kerry Ingram and Allan Clayton which were the people who played the Queen of years and her Dad in the episode. Just as I was coming out of the concert area to where all the bars were I saw a Sliuran fall down a set of stairs.

So with a interval over and the Judoon telling us we had to get back to our seats otherwise we will be killed we shuffled back to start the second half it was newer stuff this time and un lucky for us every time a person or monster came on to announce something we couldn't see them as we were sat over the part of the stage where they were however with a bit of timing in our section each row took turns to look over the rail and see who ever was talking it was manly Vesta or Strax however Matt and Jenna did come on from time to time. The biggest shock was seeing the 5th doctor(Peter Davison)  and the first doctor's companion they were there to introduce the classic pieces to us which was manly the classic medley a mish mash of some of the ionic doctor who episodes including Tomb of the Cybermen. And so because it's the second half there was lots more monsters including Judoon,Slience, Wispermen,Ood's,Soltarions,Cybermen,Icewarrior(who was in a block of ice and it broke free),Vampires from Venice and of course Daleks 3 of them to which a dalek song was performed. 

Then it was time for a break in terms of Murray Gold music to competition winners who designed a piece of music along to a clip from the Christmas episode from 2012. There were two age groups and each group had been given a different clip so it wasn't repetitive. Then it was time for Murray Gold's song for 50 and I have to say I was really unimpressed so much so that I went for a walk while the song was on. Then it was meant to be the end Matt and Jenna rushed on and said to us that it wasn't the end but that two more songs were going to be played and so they were and then the theme song came and every monster already seen invaded the hall (A cyberman was standing VERY close to where I was it was a bit creepy) we had also heard that on Saturdays performance that the synthesizer was off key and I can happily say that on Sunday it was fixed and it sounded great! Then with one final thank you to everyone who had been a part of this and after bows and them saying thank you to us it was the end. It was fantastic the whole thing from start to finish (apart from the song for 50 in my opinion).

Firstly they sacked [Councillor Myles Hogg](http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/chester-news/local-chester-news/2013/05/23/was-i-sacked-over-student-village-vote-asks-ex-chairman-of-cheshire-west-and-chester-council-s-key-planning-committee-59067-33369758/) who was against a student development being built in Chester, he was then removed from this position he has held (and he had been against this development and several others in line with the electorates wishes) and replace with Cllr Howard Greenwood, who then subsequently approved the [planning for this development](http://www.ellesmereportfirst.co.uk/news/124522/claim-that-council-is-ignoring-will-of-people-over-petition.aspx) (against the advice of the planning Officer) within 48 hours of the plan being resubmitted

Interestingly Greenwood seems to have a vested interest in this
&gt; And Cllr Hogg would advise his successor Cllr Greenwood (Farndon) to declare an interest and ‘step aside’ when the revised student village application, promoted by Bell Developments, comes before him just as Cllr Mike Jones has done because of his long-standing friendship with the Bell family.

&gt;That’s because Cllr Greenwood has confirmed to The Chronicle that he knows Mike Bell, one of the directors of Bell, through their shared passion for Chester FC and has ‘met him socially’.

&gt;He has also confirmed that prior to becoming a councillor, in [2009 or possibly earlier](http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/chester-news/local-chester-news/2013/07/18/cheshire-west-and-chester-council-planning-chairman-howard-greenwood-urged-step-down-to-face-inquiry-59067-33622320/), he approached neighbouring landowners near where he lives at Edge, near Malpas, along with Mike Bell of Bell Developments over a possible business deal but ‘nothing came of it’.

&gt;Cllr Greenwood discussed his association with the council solicitor to see whether there was any issue over him taking part in the strategic planning committee which determined the student village scheme but was reassured it was not a problem.

&gt;Cllr Greenwood, who is self-employed, is director of H &amp; L Greenwood Property Investments Ltd, Commercial Asset Management Ltd, BankchargesAU Ltd and Eddisons (Licensed, leisure and hotels) Ltd.

then a month later he approves [another development](http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/chester-news/local-chester-news/2012/06/21/farndon-homes-plan-gets-green-light-from-councillors-59067-31226352/) against the wishes of the electorate and then for a Triple Whammy adds a development into draft proposals desipte it being voted down in the meetings.  Indeed going so far to deny the [local councillor](http://garethanderson.me/2013/07/12/two-steps-forward-one-step-back-more-on-redrow/) the right to [appeal this](http://www.cheshirewestandchester.public-i.tv/core/portal/webcast_interactive/101177/start_time/2732000)

indeed the new [draft plans](http://www.cheshire-today.co.uk/17834/council-unveils-west-cheshire-development-plan/) are favouring the largest plot of development to take place around small villages where they have lots of greenspace and farmland, instead of using all the empty brownfield sites that exist in the neighbouring towns that would not only create homes but also create more jobs.

For years I have watched this nation swirling the drain and I am so utterly tired of it.
How many other people are as sick as me of the lack of communication with our government. We dont have a voice or a say in anything and it is a joke, one I have long since given up laughing at.

I am looking for people from the U.K who are as opposed to this monopoly of power the government has, to join together and start working towards a solution. We need a new political party that listens to the people and works to get these ideas into the mainstream. 
Im talking about finding out what the average person wants and will benefit from, not what will put more money in the pockets of those who already have enough.

How much money is being wasted every single day whilst the majority of our nation lives in poverty? Thatcher funeral? Olympics? We are even sending money to the Syrian rebels. Think about what this money could have done for our nation if spent on schools, hospitals or to create jobs.

I for one have grown tired of this and the time to join together is now. 
We need a new political party in the U.K and I propose it begins here and now.

It saddens me that all i have recieved is personal attacks. I thought this place would be more open to new ideas and change. Tell me critics, If i sincerely have a vision and want to better this nation how else would you have me go about it but to discuss the ideas with my peers?
I am taking action and trying to improve our situation and for that you attack me. 
THIS IS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME THIS IS ABOUT OUR NATION.
i want what is best for everyone not for me.
I want a nation where we know we are giving the youth the best possible chance in the best possible environment to do good. 


Please people if all you have to contribute are personal attacks please refrain from commenting

Just incase the title has anything to do with the hostility im receiving i thought reddit would get it since it is a joke from the simpsons.

I was diagnosed shortly after in March of this year and have been on Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) of increasing strength since Jan, including steroid injections when it gets really bad.

Basically although the drugs I am on now are fighting the inflammation, I found marijuana (provided by a friend out of sympathy) to be a great help, taking away a great deal of pain and soreness. I am not a habitual smoker, I tried it a few times in University and then didn't really encounter it again until this year, but I recently got another small amount through this friend and tried smoking it again and the effect was not the same. This marijuana had obviously been treated with something and was far too powerful for me, as I was looking for pain relief rather than altering my consciousness. I also do not wish to be even mildly high in the mornings for work, so less powerful the strain the better. I have no ""contacts"" and after asking the friend they told me the stuff that is sold on the streets is meant to be recreational, and is often very powerful.

I find myself in the position of looking at my small garden shed and wondering if it would be possible for me to grow one or two plants, strictly and totally for my own use. I would never take the risk of offering it to others, even for free. I have tried to research strains which might have been developed for pain and to aid with sleep, as this is something I still struggle with, even on all the prescribed medication.

So - if, God forbid, I was discovered or raided, what would be the worst I could expect? I do not want to mess with the law, but those few golden times when I actually got a good nights sleep and felt the pain and soreness ebbing away were something I do want to repeat again, even at risk.

Im not very comfortable with this, and im going on holiday very soon. And in my previous experiences travelling abroad, im the guy they 'pick at random'.

There is a lot of data on my phone i would like to keep (simply wiping it isn't an option). Photos, sentimental messages, you know the deal. And there's also a lot of data in my phone i dont want shared.

 What do you suggest i do?

I was diagnosed shortly after in March of this year and have been on Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) of increasing strength since Jan, including steroid injections when it gets really bad.
Basically although the drugs I am on now are fighting the inflammation, I found marijuana (provided by a friend out of sympathy) to be a great help, taking away a great deal of pain and soreness. I am not a habitual smoker, I tried it a few times in University and then didn't really encounter it again until this year, but I recently got another small amount through this friend and tried smoking it again and the effect was not the same. This marijuana had obviously been treated with something and was far too powerful for me, as I was looking for pain relief rather than altering my consciousness. I also do not wish to be even mildly high in the mornings for my work (a PT position close to home), so less powerful the strain the better. I have no ""contacts"" and after asking the friend they told me the stuff that is sold on the streets is meant to be recreational, and is often very powerful, and treated with other substances sometimes.
I find myself in the position of looking at my small garden shed and wondering if it would be possible for me to grow one or two plants, strictly and totally for my own use. I would never take the risk of offering it to others, even for free. I have tried to research small strains which might have been developed for pain and to aid with sleep, as this is something I still struggle with, even on all the prescribed medication.
So - if, God forbid, I was discovered or raided, what would be the worst I could expect?

Complaint title: 
Exclusivity of Doctor Who trailer in America 
Complaint description: 
I feel that as a license fee payer and a uk citizen that it is completely unjustified premiering the trailer for the Doctor Who 50th Anniversary at Comicon in America, as there are many fans of the show in the UK and other countries who have missed out on seeing the trailer, as there was a video embargo in place. I feel that the BBC panders to the American market by giving exclusives and feel that it is wrong and unfair. As a fan of Doctor Who for many years it saddens me that the BBC seen to have a disregard for its fans in other countries. Will the trailer be released here soon? Can we expect any UK exclusive trailers? 

That's my complaint I just submitted, I'm livid at the fact that the trailer won't be released over here, or at least not for a while according  to the official David Tennant twitter 
&gt;RT @mirrorjeffers BBC say no plans to show Doctor Who trailer for 50th anniversary in UK as was just a ""sneak peek"" for Comic Con.

A few weeks later, we went on vacation and the screwdriver got misplaced somewhere. We knew he'd be heartbroken, so we told him that the Doctor had borrowed his screwdriver back for a few days (while I ordered a new one from Amazon).

After it arrived, we waited until my son was in bed, placed the screwdriver with a note (""Thanks for letting me borrow it!"") outside his bedroom door, then played the TARDIS sound on my computer speakers. He came running out and found the screwdriver that ""the Doctor"" had ""brought back.""

She was quite hard to read. Sense of humour has always been very important to me, and the weirder and more surreal the better. As a point of reference, it was around the time 'Smell of Reeves and Mortimer' was being shown.

Near the end of the date I remember thinking that this was a bit of a washout, and was already thinking about what I'd do later when I got home. For reasons I don't really remember, the conversation turned to TV shows and when I mentioned Reeves and Mortimer, her entire face lit up and she leaned forward. She was able to sing full songs from the show, like ""[Hello, we're a couple of girls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-b0Eb5x6Yk)' and 'Trapped in my flat'. I couldn't believe my ears. She instantly became ten times more attractive.

how many people would be interested in joining??

also, a few ""tipping format"" questions and options:

1. best host? yahoo or other?
2. public or private (subreddit members only)?
3. recommended tipping format (eg, 1 point for a win, 1 for a draw, 2 for away win)

the other big question is whether people would be interested in a paid tipping comp (eg, £2 entry fee - winner takes all).

let's discuss this and we can get something running in the next week or so ... 

***

**edit:** seems people are interested, which is good ... and quite a few are keen on a paid tipping comp.

let's give it 24 hours to garner more discussion while i figure out the details. so far it seems the most popular choices are

1. public comp (free) *maybe this one could be private, just for us subreddit fans!

&gt;Dear James Clappison,
&gt;
&gt;I am writing to your concerning the Prime Minister's suggestions to
&gt;limit internet freedom. These plans are completely abhorrent and
&gt;morally reprehensible and the only reason I am writing this email is
&gt;due to the fact that I know it is a topic which many people will be too
&gt;embarrassed to write to their local MP about.
&gt;
&gt;Not only do our current laws overstep the mark by outlawing certain
&gt;types of pornography on television, but also banning ownership of
&gt;certain types of animated pornography which are perfectly legal in many
&gt;countries around the world. The further regulations suggested will take
&gt;us to new levels of censorship never seen before in true liberal
&gt;democracies. When combining this with Edward Snowden’s leaks, it is
&gt;hard to for me to consider this country free any more.
&gt;
&gt;While the government clearly lacks the moral authority to implement
&gt;such a plan, it also clearly lacks the intellectual rigour to
&gt;understand that it will fail to achieve any of the desired goals.
&gt;Anyone who truly believes that stopping depictions of rape being shown
&gt;online will reduce the number of rapists is grossly mistaken. All the
&gt;recent statistics have shown that as access to pornography has grown,
&gt;the number of sexual assaults committed has fallen. By not allowing
&gt;someone to fulfil their sexual fantasies online, you are creating a
&gt;situation where people will have to find other methods to fulfil these
&gt;fantasies, likely leading to worse outcomes arising.
&gt;
&gt;These plans also raise many concerns about enforcement and data
&gt;privacy. I would be greatly appreciative if you could try and find
&gt;answers from ministers for the following questions I have. Who decides
&gt;what pornography counts as rape? Is extreme BDSM rape? Is animated
&gt;pornography depicting rape illegal? Will this list of people who have
&gt;requested pornography be completely private? How will you be able to
&gt;tell who is accessing such pornography without monitoring everybody's
&gt;internet traffic? How will websites hosted abroad be forced to comply?
&gt;
&gt;Further to these questions I have, I would also like to speak about the
&gt;unintended consequences of these actions. There are many websites which
&gt;are not centred on pornography, but often have pornographic links
&gt;posted on them. Two notable examples of such websites include both
&gt;Reddit and 4Chan, Reddit being a website where people share links to
&gt;other websites and 4Chan being an image discussion board. If these
&gt;websites get blocked by the proposal, the government will end up
&gt;censoring huge parts of the internet and severely limiting free speech.
&gt;Wikipedia was once blocked because it came up on the child porn
&gt;censors, how can we ensure that we have a free web when some
&gt;unaccountable bureaucrat or poorly written computer program will likely
&gt;be controlling what we can and cannot see? Even if the censorship were
&gt;100% efficient, why does the government have the right to monitor my
&gt;viewing content?
&gt;
&gt;I also find myself having to ask who actually wants this? On every
&gt;comment section on every website I have visited, including the Daily
&gt;Mail, the majority of people have been in opposition to this plan. The
&gt;use of pornography is so widespread that almost no one would support
&gt;such measures. An anecdotal example to prove this point is the fact
&gt;that Canadian scientists wanted to conduct a study where they compared
&gt;the differences in people who regularly consume pornography and those
&gt;who have never seen it. The study had to stop after they could find no
&gt;one who had never watched pornography. Consider this point, who is
&gt;David Cameron trying to pander to with this policy? Is it the social
&gt;conservatives who won’t be voting Conservative due to his support of
&gt;gay marriage? (It is worth pointing out that I supported such measures,
&gt;but was upset by the fact that discrimination still occurs from the
&gt;government against those seeking multi-person marriages.) Is this
&gt;measure to try and win the vote of sheltering suburban parents who will
&gt;most likely vote Conservative regardless of this bill? Or is it to try
&gt;and win the vote of the young generation who are increasingly
&gt;libertarian and oppose the growth in the nanny state and will now never
&gt;considering voting Conservative?
&gt;
&gt;This plan is possibly the most significant step in having a
&gt;fully-fledged nanny state, which foolishly I thought the Conservatives
&gt;were supposed to oppose? It is absurd to suggest that the government
&gt;knows what is best for people when consuming pornography. It is also a
&gt;huge admission that the government considers the majority of adults
&gt;incapable of deciding what is best for themselves and their children. I
&gt;would also like to dispute the fact that pornography is bad for
&gt;children. How many 13-17 do you think can say hand on heart that they
&gt;have never watched pornography? And how many of these 13-17 olds do you
&gt;think are a problem to society? I attended the [removed for privacy], a local school which is expected to produce some of the
&gt;greatest minds in our country, and I can safely say that every single
&gt;pupil in my year watched pornography before they were legally able to
&gt;do so. Do you think this has caused serious problems in their
&gt;development, or is the government wrong to say that it is damaging to
&gt;children?
&gt;
&gt;Finally, how does the government expect these plans to be implemented?
&gt;There are many measures which can be used to circumvent any
&gt;restrictions on a free internet. Anybody who is half computer literate
&gt;will be able to start using proxy servers or virtual private networks
&gt;in order to beat the system. An anecdotal example again is shown by a
&gt;Japanese man who issued bomb threats online using Tor and the police
&gt;arrested several wrong suspects trying to find this man who is still at
&gt;large. The Tor network is a system which encrypts internet traffic and
&gt;sends it through countless different computers before it reaches its
&gt;desired destination, making it near impossible to track. There are many
&gt;websites which are only accessible using Tor such as The Silk Road
&gt;which is essentially an eBay for illegal drugs, and not only has every
&gt;government globally been unable to shut down this website on the
&gt;darknet, but the use of this website and other similar ones are
&gt;completely anonymous and go unnoticed by the police due to encryption
&gt;technology and are still growing in popularity. This means that the
&gt;only people you will be stopping from accessing these types of soon to
&gt;be forbidden pornography will be those who can't use computers to their
&gt;full extent and those who wish to access the most extreme forms of
&gt;pornography will still be able to do so. Not only can the government
&gt;not stop the access to these servers, but encrypted payment systems
&gt;such as Bitcoin will allow these websites financial freedom as well. As
&gt;can be seen from the recent attempts to block The Pirate Bay, Kick Ass
&gt;Torents and other similar websites, for everyone one website taken
&gt;down, several more will take its place. I have no idea how familiar you
&gt;are with anything I have just mentioned, but if you are unfamiliar with
&gt;it, then I would assume so is most of Parliament. If you are unfamiliar
&gt;with it, then I have to ask whether you truly believe the government is
&gt;suited to deciding how to use a technology they know little about?
&gt;
&gt;I greatly look forward to your response. I have always taken joy in the
&gt;fact that your views have been similar to mine in the fact that you
&gt;support lower taxes, marriage equality and a referendum on membership
&gt;on the European Union. However, if this bill were to pass, I would be
&gt;forced to remove my support from the Conservative Party to either UKIP
&gt;or the Pirate Party due to how strongly I feel about this issue, not
&gt;due to making it more difficult for me to access pornography, but due
&gt;to my belief in self-determination and a free internet. Since Cameron
&gt;has took office I have failed to renew by Conservative Party
&gt;membership, please give me a reason to do so.
&gt;
&gt;Yours sincerely,

[Kyle Walker](http://d.yimg.com/i/ng/sp/empics/20120226/14/74122209-soccer-barclays-premier-league-arsenal-v-tottenham-hotspur-emirates-stadium.jpg)

&gt;Personal Info

Age: 23

DOB: 28/05/90

Nationality: English

Club History: Sheffield United (Youth) -&gt; Sheffield United (Free) -&gt; Tottenham Hotspurs (£5m)

&gt;Overview

A Sheffield United youth player Walker was brought in a £9m package that included Naughton. He was loaned back to Sheffield and after successful stints at QPR and Villa 'Arry called him into the first team for the 11-12 season. In that season, Walker was named as the Professional Footballers' Association Young Player of the Year, beating the likes of Sergio Aguero, Danny Welbeck, Danny Sturridge, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and team mate Gareth Bale to the award, and was named in the PFA Team of the Year. 

Walkers form at the beginning of the 2012/13 season was heavily off in comparison to the dizzying heights he had reached previously. Frustration crept into his game and he gave away penalties in dangerous positions many times. His poorest game was the 4-2 defeat away to Chelsea where many fans pin the blame squarely on Walker for the loss. The player received a lot of twitter abuse from spurs 'fans' and was forced to delete his account and stay out of the spotlight to save himself from the wrath of fans.

His form picked up again towards the end of the season and he picked up a deserved MOTM vs Everton and assist to keep spurs in the hunt against Southampton. 

Walker is a physically imposing beast of a player. At only 5'10"" he is very strong and will bully offensive players off the ball all day long. Adequate in the air his pace allows him to stick with any attacker in the league. His largest deficiency would be the mental aspect of the game, concentration in set pieces and frustration after being dispossessed can sometimes lead to opposition goals or cards. If he is playing with confidence, these things disappear and he becomes one of the best right backs in the league. 

Offensively Walker glues himself to the sidelines and uses this added width, his pace and his long standing relationship with Lennon to coordinate damaging attacks down the right side. On set pieces Walker opts to sit in an area between the right side post and corner of the 18-yard box, picking up the scraps from a failed corner and firing in a powerful shot from range.

His partnership with Lennon is worth noting. Many spurs fans are under the impression that Lennon's defensive work rate is heavily underrated and makes Walker appear better than he really is.

&gt;General Stats


2012/13: 47 apps. 

2.4 tackles a game and 2.8 interceptions.

0.9 fouls committed and dribbled 0.4 times a game.

0.5 offsides won and 0.3 shots a game. 

&gt;Info

- Walker was brought at the same time and is the same age as Kyle Naughton. But has advanced much further

- Rumours are that Chelsea would love to take Walker off of our hands

----------------------------------------------------

&gt;Discussion Questions (feel free to add your own)

What do you believe is the cause for the drop off in form from 11/12 to 12/13?

Has Walker's game changed under AVB in comparison to under Redknapp?

Where do you believe the ceiling of Walker's ability is?

At 23 years old (same age as Obika), what kind of future does Walker have in Spurs colours (England too if you wish)?

'Stamford Bridge' is considered to be a corruption of 'Samfordesbrigge' meaning 'the bridge at the sandy ford'. Eighteenth century maps show a 'Stanford Creek' running along the route of what is now a railway line at the back of the East Stand as a tributary of the [**Thames**](http://partleton.co.uk/eastendersRiver.jpg).
The stream had two local bridges: Stamford Bridge on the [**Fulham Road**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_Road) (also recorded as Little Chelsea Bridge) and Stanbridge on the [Kings Road], now known as Stanley Bridge.The existing Stamford Bridge was built of brick in 1860–2 and has been partly reconstructed since then.

Stamford Bridge Athletics Stadium officially opened on 28 April 1877. 

For the first 28 years of its existence it was used almost exclusively by the [**London Athletic Club**](http://kingscollections.org/exhibitions/assets/images/exh/0618/sp5_6_2fun11.jpg) as an arena for athletics meetings and not for [Football] at all.

In 1904 the ownership of the ground changed hands when [**Mr H A (Gus) Mears**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Mears) and his brother, Mr J T Mears, obtained the deeds, having previously acquired additional land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of establishing a football team there on the now 12.5 acre site.

The owners wanted a stadium that could host professional football, and hired architect [**Archibald Leitch**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Leitch), who had also designed [**Ibrox**](http://blog.viewfromgorgie.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/ibrox.jpg), [**Celtic Park**](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-P4XJIJ50ITA/TfKrxTX9-9I/AAAAAAAAACk/HmJvd01STk8/s400/Modern+Celtic+Park2.jpg), [**Craven Cottage**](http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article6288609.ece/ALTERNATES/w460/craven-cottage.jpg) and [**Hampden Park**](http://www.theglasgowstory.com/images/TGSE00321_m.jpg) to design a new stadium.

Stamford Bridge was almost completely rebuilt in 1905, initially including a 120 yard long stand on the [**East side**](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Stamford_Bridge_1905.jpg/220px-Stamford_Bridge_1905.jpg) which could hold 5000 spectators,  an exact replica of the [**Johnny Haynes**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=johnny+haynes+stand&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=wAftUbv6Oqib0QWW0IGIDg&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=677&amp;sei=xQftUdiAJ6PM0QXw7oCADg#facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=WAzk90I4hcd6BM%3A%3BwcUll5725KmfDM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.footballgroundguide.com%252Ffulham%252Fphoto7.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.footballgroundguide.com%252Ffulham%252F%3B605%3B226) stand he had previously built at the re-developed [**Craven Cottage**](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/04/03/article-1372878-0B7669CE00000578-959_634x415.jpg) (and the main reason why Fulham had chosen not to move into the new ground) The other sides were all open in a vast bowl with thousands of tons of material excavated from the building of the [**London Underground Picadilly Line**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccadilly_line) provided the foundation for high terracing on the [**West Side**](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Bird_Eye_Pictures_of_Chelsea%27s_Stamford_Bridge_stadium_1909.jpg).

The capacity was originally planned to be 100,000. It was the second largest in country behind [**Crystal Palace**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1fa7zIgQtc#t=o1m37s) - the [**FA Cup**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSSbgU_KKbQ#t=05m33s) final venue.

 It was subsequently offered to [**Fulham FC**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts7o-73eSb0) as they were the major team in the region, who turned the offer down. Thus, newly formed [**Chelsea FC**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ALQM5jJ9s) moved in instead.

 the stadium remained largely unchanged until 1930 when the [**""Shed End""**](http://www.chelseafc.com/javaImages/c8/59/0,,10268~3693000,00.jpg) terraced area was erected. A vast bank of terracing behind the southern goal it was to become the mecca for Chelsea' most die hard supporters and would forever be associated with Stamford Bridge, until the terrace was demolished in 1994 (when all-seater stadiums became compulsory by law as a safety measure in light of the Taylor Report following the [**Hillsborough**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuSHrhPQyk) disaster)

In 1939, a small two storied North Stand including seating was erected.

At the moment I have 3 accounts with Natwest: my checking (debit card), a savings account and an ISA. No idea if that is relevant or if any personal info would help.

So, yeah, I guess I just want a low-risk card for little purchases here and there that I can automatically pay off and not have to worry about interest.

I am however unaware of specific details when it comes to working in the UK, to be able to accurately assess the offer. 

Is there a place I can look up average salaries in London, where I can input level of education, experience, language skills and other details, to get the best quote? Also any ideas for a place I can get an indication of how much I will be left with after tax? What is the situation with insurance? What is the average vacation time? Is it separate from absence due to health issues? What are the usual working hours?

I have also been informed that there is something called ""Relocation Fees"" offered to people migrating from one country to another for work -anyone know if that's standard or up to the company?

I know I could head straight for the local Halfords but that that might not be the best first option. 

I'll consider a second hand bike but ideally don't want to spend tonnes on this (in case it gets stolen etc.) - let's say up to about £100 with a little flexibility. 

*Ideally* the bike will be more suited to road use than mountain trails, have disc brakes and Deore type gears. Huge front forks or elaborate suspension aren't such an issue. Also I am male and under six feet in height (about 5 foot 10 IIRC).

I'm looking to create (or get involved in, as I've no real experience or interest in moderating Subs) a UK movement similar to the US /r/RestoreTheFourth.

In an initial fit of passion, I started /r/RestoreTheFourthUK (which, I realise, was a terrible name. However, I didn't/don't feel that I, or anyone else, should alone come up with the movement's name), which has done less-than-*okay*. It's largely the name, as the community, though small, is pretty dedicated to the cause, as I'm sure most of us would be with a proper outlet.

So what do you think it should be called? How do we start? The name is a massive barrier to entry as it's notoriously difficult to get people subscribing and resubscribing to a string of different subs and Reddit tends to be quite superficial about Sub-names alone. It would be great to hear your ideas!

Thanks, **currently [discussing on IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/?settings=dd892af474749b032ba39bb88a8894d9) on #Reinst8 if anyone fancies a chat!**

**EDIT: I'm told to point out that we're on SNOONET for those using an IRC client**

P.S. I'm trying hard to overcome the fact that Reddit makes everything we all say look a lot like oneupmanship, criticism etc. If you have any interest in the goals of a movement such as /r/RestoreTheFourth, please bring your ideas and motivation so that we can move forwards as one! There's no sub-text or wish to somehow 'get one over' on everyone. I'm just keen to get this moving!

**EDIT: After a long IRC discussion, and having scoured previous threads with name suggestions, we'd like to put the vote to you guys.**

**[HERE'S THE LINK TO THE NAME VOTE!](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DT83XLV)**

**Another Edit:** [**The Survey**](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DT83XLV) has, thus far, had ~~55~~ 75(!) responses! ~~It's set to shut at 23:45 as we need to get the whole name thing out of the way~~As it's a free account, it'll stop at 100 submissions, and unless something bizarre happens (such as everyone voting for their own idea), then we should be good to proceed in our own Sub following that. I'll keep you in the loop, and keep voting. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: there's nothing quite like filtering through vote replies of a Summer's eve.
  
**Final Update (I think):**

To keep it as fair as possible, the voting consisted of three rounds (all within the same vote), weighted according to the order of the choice (i.e. 1st choice is weighted more heavily than 3rd, naturally). I also included an option for people to 'spoil' their vote by submitting their own thing, which only a handful of users opted to do. Had lots of people elected to do this, we would've had to open it up again entirely to new suggestions, so I'm glad it didn't happen. Anyway, the results are counted and verified, and here you go:


**Name**| **Weighted Results**

***

For that reason, **all activity for this movement will now take place in the about-to-be-made-unprivate /r/ReinstateArticle8**. I hope you'll join us and thank you for all your brilliant efforts so far. I know not all of us will like the name, but the important thing is that it was settled fairly and that we have one. It's catchy enough to work with the media, and makes enough sense to support the movement and, as such, will more than suit our needs. 

We'd love to hear from you (particularly if you've got some useful skillset such as web-design, CSS, Sub-Reddit modding, Press experience etc.), so please do get in touch and help us all out.

'Stamford Bridge' is considered to be a corruption of 'Samfordesbrigge' meaning 'the bridge at the sandy ford'. Eighteenth century maps show a 'Stanford Creek' running along the route of what is now a railway line at the back of the East Stand as a tributary of the [**Thames**](http://partleton.co.uk/eastendersRiver.jpg).
The stream had two local bridges: Stamford Bridge on the [**Fulham Road**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_Road) (also recorded as Little Chelsea Bridge) and Stanbridge on the [Kings Road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Road), now known as Stanley Bridge.The existing Stamford Bridge was built of brick in 1860–2 and has been partly reconstructed since then.

Stamford Bridge Athletics Stadium officially opened on 28 April 1877. 

For the first 28 years of its existence it was used almost exclusively by the [**London Athletic Club**](http://kingscollections.org/exhibitions/assets/images/exh/0618/sp5_6_2fun11.jpg) as an arena for athletics meetings and not for [Football] at all.

In 1904 the ownership of the ground changed hands when [**Mr H A (Gus) Mears**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Mears) and his brother, Mr J T Mears, obtained the deeds, having previously acquired additional land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of establishing a football team there on the now 12.5 acre site.

The owners wanted a stadium that could host professional football, and hired architect [**Archibald Leitch**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Leitch), who had also designed [**Ibrox**](http://blog.viewfromgorgie.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/ibrox.jpg), [**Celtic Park**](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-P4XJIJ50ITA/TfKrxTX9-9I/AAAAAAAAACk/HmJvd01STk8/s400/Modern+Celtic+Park2.jpg), [**Craven Cottage**](http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article6288609.ece/ALTERNATES/w460/craven-cottage.jpg) and [**Hampden Park**](http://www.theglasgowstory.com/images/TGSE00321_m.jpg) to design a new stadium.

Stamford Bridge was almost completely rebuilt in 1905, initially including a 120 yard long stand on the [**East side**](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Stamford_Bridge_1905.jpg/220px-Stamford_Bridge_1905.jpg) which could hold 5000 spectators,  an exact replica of the [**Johnny Haynes**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=johnny+haynes+stand&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=wAftUbv6Oqib0QWW0IGIDg&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=677&amp;sei=xQftUdiAJ6PM0QXw7oCADg#facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=WAzk90I4hcd6BM%3A%3BwcUll5725KmfDM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.footballgroundguide.com%252Ffulham%252Fphoto7.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.footballgroundguide.com%252Ffulham%252F%3B605%3B226) stand he had previously built at the re-developed [**Craven Cottage**](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/04/03/article-1372878-0B7669CE00000578-959_634x415.jpg) (and the main reason why Fulham had chosen not to move into the new ground) The other sides were all open in a vast bowl with thousands of tons of material excavated from the building of the [**London Underground Picadilly Line**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccadilly_line) provided the foundation for high terracing on the [**West Side**](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Bird_Eye_Pictures_of_Chelsea%27s_Stamford_Bridge_stadium_1909.jpg).

The capacity was originally planned to be 100,000. It was the second largest in country behind [**Crystal Palace**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1fa7zIgQtc#t=o1m37s) - the [**FA Cup**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSSbgU_KKbQ#t=05m33s) final venue.

 It was subsequently offered to [**Fulham FC**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts7o-73eSb0) as they were the major team in the region, who turned the offer down. Thus, newly formed [**Chelsea FC**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ALQM5jJ9s) moved in instead.

 the stadium remained largely unchanged until 1930 when the [**""Shed End""**](http://www.chelseafc.com/javaImages/c8/59/0,,10268~3693000,00.jpg) terraced area was erected. A vast bank of terracing behind the southern goal it was to become the mecca for Chelsea' most die hard supporters and would forever be associated with Stamford Bridge, until the terrace was demolished in 1994 (when all-seater stadiums became compulsory by law as a safety measure in light of the Taylor Report following the [**Hillsborough**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuSHrhPQyk) disaster)

In 1939, a small two storied North Stand including seating was erected. It was originally intended to span the entire northern end, but the outbreak of World War II and its aftermath compelled the club to keep the stand small.

It seems to me that this is not a matter of child protection, if it was then why wouldn't they employ a less aggressive tactic such as recommending the use of parental controls on the child's computer or, dare I say not allow children to use computers unsupervised - that's how my parents protected me. 

We're a relatively proud nation when it comes to looking reputable, how many people do you actually think are going to have the courage to phone their ISP and say ""Hi, please give me back my porn."" I'd wager that most would be too scared of what people would think. In this case the government isn't protecting and are instead limiting that person's access to freedom. 

It's also probable that this change will be put in place and some irrelevant statistic will show that something has improved since the change. Once that occurs it would be easy for those in favour of censorship to say that blocking content X will reduce the spread of crime Y and then we have this horrific database of blacklisted websites. Once we have that we're not being ""protected"" we're being imprisoned and limited. 

On reddit we have a large and varied content base, some of which could be considered pornographic. Does that mean they have the right to block reddit? You could even argue that porn and unsuitable materials circulate Facebook and twitter, in that case would they block those too?

There is way too many grey areas where the overwhelming majority of content is valid and reputable but some adult material exists. 

The UK has been a great country to live in for freedom so far, we've not had anything like SOPA pushed on us (atleast not by our own government) nor have we seen any very aggressive ISP level filtering as of yet (Yes I know about PirateBay). It would be a shame if we went the route of limiting freedom and effectively ruining everything that makes this country great.

Also not sure If most people understand how cigarette branding works.

Basically All the variants you see behind the counter are actually 2-3 companies producing various 'brand names'. Almost like when you buy soft drinks they all say in small writing ^coca-cola somewhere on the bottle... different 'brands', same company. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_American_Tobacco#Current
 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Tobacco#Cigarettes

Edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallaher_Group#Operations

~~I dont remeber what the third one is but most of the brands you see are covered by the two links supplied!~~ - Check and see if your brand is there!

So this means 2 or 3 companies have persuaded the government not to pursue plain packaging. Please correct me if I'm wrong.


**David Cameron on Plain packaging back in February**  [source](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0001.htm#13022775000009)

Q10. [144295] **Ian Mearns (Gateshead) (Lab)**: My local authority has done some pioneering work over the years on improving public health and has recently
asked adults to refrain from smoking in children’s play areas. Does the Prime Minister agree with me, with his own Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry), and with my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton North (Alex Cunningham), who has a private Member’s Bill on the issue, that we should go a significant step further and introduce a ban on smoking when children are present in vehicles?

**The Prime Minister**: We should look carefully at what the hon. Gentleman and others have said. We are looking across the piece at all the issues, including whether we should follow the Australians with the ban on packaging and what more we can to do to restrict smoking in public places. There has been a real health advance from some of the measures that have been taken. We must consider each one and work out whether there is a real public health benefit, but he makes a good point.

Edit: Why do the three producers of tobacco need like, 30 brands? why not have a couple of different strengths and stop there? Is it because they want exposure for their product? Is it because they have an established place in shops - a big space behind the counter where pretty much everyone using the shop will see them, while they wait as well!.  Its obvious how important branding is to these companies... so If you want to argue against plain packaging then (as far as i can see) I don't know what other stance you can have other than pro smoking.

Some children may be distressed by what they find online, and it is up to you to help their parents help them.

It is our duty, as Britons, to aid this noble quest to the best of our abilities - as such, I propose a campaign to support number 10 in their mission to block all pornography (except for the deviant individuals who  endanger our children by opting out). 

To accomplish this goal, it is vital we help build the blacklist of webpages to be blocked, I suggest sending 1 webpage URL per hour to the relevant authorities so they can verify the page's potential harm to children. If enough of us help out, and we send them enough pages we will finish the list in no time. Every little link helps, even if it's just a few per day, or once per week.

I advise you to send questionable internet content to either local authorities or downing street itself, here are some relevant contact details:

camerond@parliament.uk - The man himself  
https://email.number10.gov.uk/ - number10 contact form  
[@Number10gov](http://twitter.com/number10gov) / [@Number10press](http://twitter.com/number10press) - number10 twatter

Alternatively, you can get in touch with Claire Perry - professional moral crusader/Cameron's adviser on the sexualisation and commercialisation of childhood - she knows better than anyone what will mess a child up.

claire.perry.mp@parliament.uk  
[@claire4devizes](https://twitter.com/claire4devizes)

Feel free to send links you aren't sure on, just ask for help in deciding if the page is immoral enough or not.

I am trying to collect historical information about anything similar happening abroad. I am also trying to collect information about other government policies that were spun in a certain way, then used for something else. I need help to find data to back up my thoughts that this is likely NOT just a porn filter, and this WILL lead to more restrictions on the internet and what we can view only. Only when we can show this is not just about porn will we be able to get enough people to fight against it to stop it happening.

This is not about ISP's filtering pornography, and more about let ISP start filtering anything the government finds inappropriate. Pornography will only be the beginning, it won't be long before things like Wiki-Leaks, and anti-government websites start getting blocked too. Hell, I wouldn't be at all surprised if this is also being put in place to stop copyright infringement, and start filtering pirated content.

Any parent who doesn't want their child looking at porn can already filter it out, they just need to put in a bit of effort to set it up themselves or pay someone else to do it. Letting the government control what is and isn't allowed through ISP filters is not a good idea.
GCHQ's 'Mastering the Internet' already talks of banning TOR and VPN's, and now they want control of filters.

Of all the reasons to stand up to the government, this is one of the biggest, but because instead of introducing it as a government filter of the internet, they are introducing it as a porn filter, few people, and certainly anyone important, want to stand against it or be labelled a pervert. How would an MP look saying he doesn't want porn to be filtered in the UK?

I also have an odd apreciation for how this story has been spun. They make it about sometime that has a bad stigma attached to it, though most of the population is fine with. They also announced it right as another 'popular' story is all over the news, the new Royal child baby thing.

TL;DR: Using porn to set up a government controlled filter will result in less people standing up for it in fear of being labelled perverts. Once the filter is in place, the government can filter out anything, giving them a little control in the form of an opt out system will eventually turn into a complete filter you can't opt out of, and having the government in control of what you are and aren't allowed to view is bad.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,"Help find and organise historical data to fight against the Porn Filter.

Hey, my name's Sam and I'm currently an MSc student at the University of Bristol, due to graduate at the end of August. Therefore I am looking for somebody to flatshare with in September. 

Obviously I want somebody who I am going to get along with. However I'm pretty easy-going, and I can find that I can get along with most people given the time. I'm currently working as a brain injury support worker. I already have a few friends living in Bristol (plus a girlfriend) who have already found flats leaving me to find somebody new. I enjoy the occasional night out, and I'm always up for the standard pub trip, however I am happy to spend the evening at home watching TV or playing PS3. At times I do like my privacy, otherwise I'm a pretty sociable person though. 

My budget is at a max £400 per month (each), until I can find myself a better paid job. The locations I want to live in is anywhere central i.e. Redland, Cotham, Clifton etc. I don't mind an unfurnished flat, I don't have much furniture of my own (other than a big 32"" HDTV which can go in the lounge) but I'm happy to live like a bum until we obtain some of our own furniture. Anyway get in contact if you're interested, we can go for a pint or something and if we get along and start looking for a place.

pornography banned by default unless otherwise opted out.
 I feel that this move is out of touch with the reality of most
citizens and is attempting to sledgehammer a solution for the
protection of groups that need their vulnerabilities covered in other,
more robust ways.
 An example of this is children - Mr Cameron announced that access to
online pornography is ""corroding youth"". The censor only serves to
cause a shift away from parental pressure to educate their children
correctly onto a dangerous precedent that the government can educate
your children for you and enforce a societal climate on what is and is
not sexually acceptable.
 I understand that the societal acceptance of rape culture is somewhat
creeping and worrying, but a blanket ban on the material is simply
short-sighted. Efforts should instead be in place to educate the
offenders on not committing the offense and why it is morally wrong
rather than to ostracize the issue and never educate anyone.
Furthermore, a very large portion of rapes are crimes of passion and
are not premeditated; is the blanket ban of access to material that
depicts rape going to stop these people? I do not believe so, only
through education can we teach people how morally reprehensible this
is.
 The specific attack on pornography that depicts rape is perhaps
well-intended, but violates the rights of consenting adult citizens. If
two adults share this fantasy and wish to act it out in a harmless
context, then they should be allowed to do so without an enforced
social stigma (the ""oh you had your internet unblocked, are you some
kind of perv?"" effect).
 I am an advocate of protecting vulnerable groups, but I am not an
advocate of sacrificing liberty for safety. Our efforts as a society
should instead be focused on educating people, not restricting people
(with a few exceptions - e.g child pornography). Either we have free
speech, or we do not. If we slowly have our liberties eroded by
government, even if they allow us an opt-out feature, then we are in
danger of losing our future freedoms.

I hope that you will argue against the amendments of the Criminal
Justice and Immigration Act.

* Removed crests from sidebar. I personally found them tacky, and troublesome to maintain.

* Alt version: I've attempted to improve reading flow by hiding the post command list until a hover state. It works but l'm sceptical of the whitespace.

If the cissokho loan move with option to buy is true I would be very pleased, good bit of business without too much commitment, and some much needed cover and competition for Enrique

As much as I want it to be true, and I'm sure the rest of you do too, I can't imagine we'd sign papa before the end of this window, unless we get an offer for skrtl or Coates.

Alderwiereld isn't happening or it would already be a done deal, and I don't think eriksen has ever been a real target now we've got Alberto and coutinho

DM isn't a big worry for me, we've got enough healthy competition in the middle right now and I've got faith in hendo and Allen, remember Lucas wasn't that much of class player when we first signed him, but now he's one of the best in the world

RW I think we'll be OK with aspas downing and Sturridge all able to play on the right and all left footed 

On the left hendo coutinho sterling ibe and Alberto could all play, and I'm sure a few more

Shaqiri would be a dream come true but its obviously not happening

And I know most of you think he's too old and over priced but I think soldado paired with Suarez would be magnificent, with Suarez playing just in behind, and it would add some needed class and experience to that end of the pitch, just look at what van persie did for man u last year and he's 30",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Who will our next signings be?,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1iue7p/who_will_our_next_signings_be/

As you all know outside the house is a dangerous place, with thousands of people dying each year to traffic incidents, extreme weather, exposure, drugs (which are bought outdoors), accidents and having fun.

I think that councils need to step up to their moral obligation to keep people safe and prevent the corrosion of childhood as many children can often be seen hanging around parks, riding bicycles recklessly in designated areas, and flirting with the opposite sex.

As such it is only responsible for us to support the nanny state in keeping the moral stature of the UK.

Since i have had my bike i was under the impression that it was fine to park a motorcycle on the pavement as long as your using your common sense and following the basic highway code (E.g. Not parking on a corner, blocking entrances or parking in front of a massive sign saying ""Do not park""). Most importantly not restricting access to the pavement, i usually judge it based on that if two 30 stone people could pass through side by side then it wouldn't be a problem.

Although while i was visiting one of the watering hole in the town center today i was asked by the manager to move my bike from out the outside the front window as it was ""Not allowed!"". Bare in mind i was following my 30 stone rule. I said that was fine and moved it down one of the side streets instead and that was the end of that.

This got me questioning if i was wrong to think parking on the pavement was ok. I know that parking partially or wholly on the pavement in London is banned but i am based in Lancashire.

Can anybody clear this up for me or does anyone have any stories of problems they have had while parking on a pavement?
