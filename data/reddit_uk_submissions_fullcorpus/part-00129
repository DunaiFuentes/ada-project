Although our defense has been quite competent as of late, it seems as if there is a lot of uncertainty in player selection/positioning.  

Although we have been stopping many opponents and defending admirably, I don't necessarily think our setup is entirely secure.  Our left back situation has resulted in Dave ?temporarily? filling in leaving Cole and Bertrand twiddling their thumbs, which has forced Ivanovic out on the right, and I don't think we've figured out a proper rotation for Luiz/Cahill/Terry or the younger prospects.

I believe that Azpi is performing brilliantly given that he doesn't really have a left foot.  I also think that Ivanovic's defensive game has been quite solid, yet he seems somewhat lost once he darts into the attacking third.  Terry has played practically every minute in the BPL, yet we can't rely on him to keep up this pace at his age. Mourinho doesn't seem to be entirely confident in a Cahill/Luiz pairing or putting Luiz in the CDM.  Our prospect CB's haven't received much playing time either(Kalas, Ake).

In my own opinion, I believe that Luiz should fill in at CDM this next game as a trial run, especially now that Ramires is suspended; I thought he had a few mistakes in that position during the Benitez era but he was just getting used to the switch.  I think that Dave should slide back to the right, and Ivano should pair with Cahill in the Center- give JT a rest, and rotate between Cole and Bertrand at the left. That way, we would have more of a wing-back combo and allow Hazard/Mata/Willian/Schurrle/etc to pull the strings from the center of the attacking third.  

What are some of your opinions??

Here is the final doc ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AnbRX76-rFRIdFZPN1Q4RURaOU1nZGpmQTN1MzZNOVE&amp;output=html ) 

Some key points

* 49.34% chance that we will be in the 4th position That is really good.
* 1% chance that we be top of the table :P

Earlier reports [ GW18](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1tlgje/gameweek_18_possibilities/) , [ GW17](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1szz7b/gameweek_17_possibilities/) , [GW16](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1spi1i/gameweek_16update/)


For people seeing this for first time. Small guide to the spreadsheet 

* Home means home teams wins
* Draw is a draw
* Away means away team wins


***FAQ' s***


*  **Why are United / Spurs not considered ?** The result of their matches wont affect our position, that is why
*  **Where did you pick the odds for each match ?** bet365 
*  **Hey I have an idea, how can I contribute ?** Send me a pm 
*  **Is goal difference considered ?** Nope, it would be nightmare :(

Constructive criticism is much appreciated! I hope you guys enjoy.

An Ode to Trenzalore

The almost bloodiest battle
In all of time and space
In a town called Christmas
In the cold he embraced

All his past presentations
And representations
Of justice and liberty
Through one occupation

Helping those in need
Counting countless victories
But when teardrop fall
Compassion becomes a vacavity

He neglects the loneliness
Building inside, the bliss
That once burned brightly
Gave a last goodbye kiss

Pretending to successfully thrive
In the solitude, his lie
Will not help him be happy
When he's run out of time

He never stops talking
About nothing, and walking
To outrun the cowardly
Acts that keep knocking

His hubris is the words he speaks
Binding him to be forever weak
He talks to dodge the question
That the universe comes to seek

The silence fell when he refused
He stopped running only to lose
In his battle to reign victorious
This man, the doctor, but doctor who?

Heartache created a hardened sore
When the men's prophecy swore
""The man who lies will lie no more
When this man lies at Trenzalore""

With nobody he could express
The feelings of true depress
Emptiness and loneliness
In the basement in a town Christmas

Oh but Trenzalore skies have shattered
Life is given to the dead man, tattered
And raggedy from saving worlds
Standing, both beaten and battered

His life flashes before his eyes
An old friend, one last surprise
A final farewell before the bow tie fell
And the doctor continued his lives",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,[Christmas special] An Ode to Trenzalore,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1tsmd0/christmas_special_an_ode_to_trenzalore/

We are a company that specialises in a niche market selling a certain type of high security door. 

We have a niche product that is not know in the market, and have developed it so it's now possibly financially accessible to all. In order to be a success, we want a tool to enable easier purchase/understanding of the products online, in order to utilise an variety of Internet marketing strategies such as affiliate programmes, and Facebook marketing as well as b2b sales strategies including functions such as 'dealer log in', and marketing functions. 

We are looking to develop a front end and also are considering using an engine on the back end, an example of this has  been developed by The glazing vault http://www.theglazingvault.com/engine-compositedoor.php

If this isn't suitable then we would look to develop our own engine. 

We are looking for individuals that not only can help assess &amp; manage this process but also assist in guiding the role out of said online marketing strategies. 

This isn't necessarily a role where the individual has to possess all the skills, but they must be able to know how to manage the roll out and be able to outsource parts that cannot be done in house. A creative mind is essential with a good understanding of business and ROI. 

We realise that this is a combination of roles and are not always found together, but we know that the right individual is out there. 

If this sounds like you, please get in touch. Hopefully you will have a portfolio or something substantial to show us :) 

The role can be remote or based in London, UK.  

Looking forward to hearing from you, oh special one... ;)

Now, I will tell you my opinion and you can consider it or not; I have seen a few games where he looked good, and in these games Tottenham looked strong in possession and basically there weren't that many dangerous plays near the box (not even with MU), and when he made a mistake or was let behind (Valencia for example made him look stupid 2-3 times) it did not resulted in a goal thus it was ignored.

Things changed in the last games, the team is pressured, he is put in one on one challenges and suddenly he looks uncertain, makes mistakes, is ridiculed by attackers, looses air duels you name it.

So you don't judge a defender in a game where the team midfield keeps possession and he has to make some easy clearances, but when things get rough and he is put to work. 

Now you draw your conclusions, mine is made - I think I was right when I said his price tag was a fucking joke and that he will fail miserably in EPL things start to go in this direction we will see the next games.

Suarez was kept relatively quiet because City's defence keyed on him. With DS playing they wouldn't have been able to do that. Despite being subdued Suarez still served up 3-4 golden chances for others. Only one was taken. I love Coutinho and Sterling but you can't help but think if Sturridge had been the benefactor we'd have gotten the draw we deserved.

This game for me highlighted our lack of depth and showcased City's squad as the best in the Prem. They have lost Aguero and not missed a beat going forward. We have been too over reliant on Suarez' magic. He needs more help than he got yesterday.

We can't expect this to be fixed in January. The summer is going to be our most crucial window in many years. If we can make the top 4 we instantly become a more attractive destination for top tier talent. Holding onto Suarez will help sway player's minds also.

Just seems like from William Hartnell to Matt Smith the good old Doctor got younger at the start of each regeneration. Even when Eight regenerated into the War Doctor he changed into a young John Hurt that was shown briefly in a reflection. Also, that Doctor lived a very long time, regenerating from old age, a fate that Matt Smith nearly also shared without hope of regenerating. It makes me think that He also might live longer with each regeneration as he starts out in a younger body the closer to the end of cycle it gets. Maybe some timey-wimey stuff where the energy taps farther into his youth every time, burning further into the reserve each time it expends a turn?

The UK is ranked 6th, but at least 3 of the countries above USA, Australia and Ireland have hefty health care burdens effecting their wages. ( Im not sure about the other countries)

So if health care deductions were to be considered compulsory I should imagine the UK would be at least 1 place higher maybe more.

First, that we were not clinical enough in a game the required perfection to win, and second, that im never going to watch games with my sister ever again because she is bad luck (Hull City).

People have been spouting off various things about how the game was decided by the refs, various kinds of shirt pulling, players not playing up to scratch, and myriad what ifs in an attempt to blame somebody, something for this loss. 

We should be proud of the result yesterday. We held City to only 2 goals, and scrappy ones at that, in the own stadium. We scored from open play and had the chance for two others (Cout's miss and Sterling's sky ball). All in all we played well considering our opponent. But even though this subreddit was realistic about our chances in the pre match thread, afterwards they felt as i we got robbed, or deserved to win the game. We did not, and here is why. 

If i see you bitching about a non call (the offsides) im not going to take you seriously. That situation is the biggest what if of them all. The call was wrong, but you get on. We still scored, and had chances to score more so i dont see what the fuss is about.

Now on the Johnson, Skrtel, and Cissoko. Shitting on these players makes some people feel good apparently. But, after a game against the best team in the league is not the time to judge a players performance. Could it be that solid games from our defenders still result in conceding a goal or two when playing THE BEST SCORING TEAM IN THE LEAGUE!? Get off Skrtels back about the shirt pulling. You all know just as well as I do that we're just talking about it because some producer has a hard on for Skrtel in the box.

This goes against the spirit of the character who may be flawed but is cunning enough to get out of almost anything.

Also, [Spoiler Description](#s ""the deux ex machina where the Doc is supercharged with a new regeneration cycle and zaps the Daleks was crap, not to say a retread of the Bad Wolf DEM."")

With that in mind, I tweaked the scene with a new script that guarantees plenty of whizzbangs but also allows the Doctor some agency, [Spoiler Description](#s ""rather than just sitting there, waiting to die, like a wet fart."") The new scene does not Sueify the Doctor, however, and has a hint of poetic justice about it.

Now, it always bothered me that this established that the Doctor would definitely live that long, completely eliminating the drama of any episode where the Doctor's life was threatened. But it also raises the question, why does the Valeyard not count as a regeneration or incarnation of the Doctor?

Interesting past meetings:

[City vs Palace - FA Cup 5th Round - 1925/26 season](http://www.britishpathe.com/video/crystal-palace-overwhelmed) - A dominant City trounce Palace 11-4 featuring 5 goals from Frank Roberts.  City would later go all the way to Wembley this year, [losing in the 1926 FA Cup Final](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhkOKCuw95U) to Bolton Wanderers.

[City vs Palace - FA Cup 3rd Round - 1980/81 season](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5ENdJxTE_c) - Another FA Cup meeting pits City against Malcolm Allison's Palace in his return to Maine Road.  Malcolm Allison was the assistant manager to Joe Mercer during City's triumphs in the 70s and later City manager himself before an acrimonious falling out with the Chairman.  Coincidentally, City also went to the FA Cup Final this year, in its 100th Final and lost after a replay.  [Ricky Villa's goal here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1ahDUm6rLw) is remembered as one of the greatest of all time in the FA Cup Final.

[City vs Palace - Div 1 - 1990/91 season](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bHx45bzn9M) - In the spirit of recent events, I thought I'd include this game where City were given the two softest penalties ever, which were easily dispatched by new signing Mark Brennan.  This team features a youth crop at City unsurpassed in our recent era.  Niall Quinn is also playing for us for you Sky Sports watchers.

[Palace vs City - League Cup 2nd Round - 2009/10 season](http://www.mcfc.co.uk/citytv/Match-highlights/2009/August/Crystal-Palace-0-2-Manchester-City-Aug-27-2009) - Carlos Tevez scores his first ever goal for City in a surprisingly strong City side fielded by Mark Hughes.

Team News:

*  Action comes thick and fast over the holiday period with us playing yesterday, tomorrow then again on New Years Day.  And I love it.

*  Demichelis (hamstring), Aguero (calf), Richards (hamstring) and Jovetic (aliens stole his fitness) all confirmed out with injury.

*  After his bench appearance against the scousers, Nastasic could be in line for a starting spot.

*  I'd expect a large rotation for a home game against a relegation candidate with so many games in a short period of time.  Boyata and Guidetti are as always waiting in the wings and the EDS are now on winter break so no clashes there.

* **CONFIRMED TEAM:** - Hart, Boyata, Kompany (C), Nastasic, Clichy, Garcia, Fernandinho, Navas, Silva, Milner, Dzeko

*  **CONFIRMED SUBS** - Pantilimon, Lescott, Kolarov, Yaya Toure, Rodwell, Nasri, Negredo.",false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,null,null,self,City vs Palace - Pre-Match Discussion,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/MCFC/comments/1tt6x5/city_vs_palace_prematch_discussion/

We've won all our home games in the EPL, we've played Arsenal, Un*ted, Everton and Spurs at home but not one of them teams put up the kind of fight Liverpool did yesterday afternoon. The supporters around me at second half, specifically the 75th minute though Liverpool was going to bag a win and that's the first time I've experienced such an atmosphere this season at the Etihad.

Even though you lost I think Liverpool are definitely title contenders. Not sure what you all think but from an outside perspective Liverpool can definitely go for top 3 this season.

I have grown to love the show so much that I really cannot be upset with any direction it goes. The fact is that I don't write the show so any complaining is pointless. The Tardis may not always take us where we want to go, but it will take us where we need to go.

Now shall we begin? I feel like this episode what absolutely rushed but that was because hundreds of years were packed into one episode. This is why I loved the episode. Because of the large span of time that took place we witnessed a representation of the Doctors life!

The episode works as a microcosm of the life of The Doctor, or The Time of The Doctor. We see a man who clearly has a long history before he started saving the people in the town of Christmas, much like The Doctor had a life on Gallifrey before he started saving people around the universe. But no matter what his past was he gets stuck saving this town, just like he had no real intentions of saving the universe time after time when he ran away from Gallifrey. The Doctor gets very very old while he is protecting Christmas and he fights a seemingly endless battle against an endless amount of enemies. If that is not symbolic of The Doctor in the Tardis I don't know what is. 

Then The Doctor grows so old that he has no plan left and the ""rules"" have him finally beat. But fuck the ""rules""! This is Doctor Who! If we have learned anything during the 50+ years of watching we have learned that the ""rules"" are more or less guidelines, like dry clean only. 

The Doctor truly believed that he was beaten but he was happy with how long he had been able to save Christmas. Christmas is the happy time of year with peace and good will towards others. The Doctor has fought his entire journey to preserve peace and good will towards others throughout the universe.

Anyway I just felt like this episode really captured what The Doctors life is about and will always be about. I will always love and remember the the time when Matt Smith was The Doctor, but no more than I will love the time that I have been able to spend with The Doctor myself. I have seen him save entire galaxies, races, and reality itself and he has always been there with a smile on his face and telling me that he has a plan.

I learned on Christmas that the Time of The Doctor is not over, nor will it be ending any time soon. Rules be damned, this is a man who transcends the rules of time and he creates his own Time. I don't know how much sense I have made or if anyone will agree with me but I just needed to get this out.

I am so impressed by him this season and I hope that he keeps on improving his game to reach new heights.

With that said, I have noticed one flaw in his game that should be easiest to fix than most and it would improve his game immensely and it will help the free flowing football that Rodgers is trying implement. That thing is his First Touch when facing away from opposition's goal. I have noticed it many times over last 2.5 years that whenever he receives the ball from either defence or midfield, his first touch is very hard/stiff/robotic. It usually results in ball ricocheting 1-2 feet away from him and he ends up playing the ball back and move on. If I was any good at video editing then I would make a video of all of these semi bad first touches. If he could learn to cushion the ball like Allen or swerve his body a little to ease the ball and make room like Sterling and Suarez, that would make a huge amount of difference in his game and our team play. It would cut out an extra pass, it could potentially help us attack faster.

I know it doesn't seem like such a huge deal but sometimes those 2-5 wasted seconds when he is trying to control the mis-controlled ball can be the difference between and an open and a closed team-mate. Hopefully our coaches at Liverpool can work with him on this aspect of his game. If he can fix this one small thing in his play, it would make him a better player and It would immensely help our team play.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Jordan Henderson's first touch.,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1ttfrn/jordan_hendersons_first_touch/

He's been very consistent with his level of play, has played every league game to date(until Sunday) and has was often seemingly the most willing player to take chances and gamble in forward areas during AVB's reign of caution and dullness.

He's been fantastic and he's also spent most of his time playing in the midfield areas. If you didn't know any better watching Spurs play you could be forgiven for thinking that he was a wide mid who raced back and bailed out the defense every now and then, not a fullback who supported attacks and occasionally got forward.

He's more and more playing like Dani Alves at Barcelona, he plays so far forward that he's really a fullback in name only, Spurs are essentially a lopsided 3-5-2 when he is fielded in the 4-4-2 system. Barcelona gets away with Alves' positioning due to their outstanding pressing abilities and the diligent defensive work carried out by Busquets who drops in as a third centerback when needed.

This can be an issue for Spurs however when they do not field the correct personnel around him, for instance, Vertonghen at the other fullback position didn't work because he too would venture forward but lacked the pace to recover and when Spurs are without Sandro the situation becomes even worse. Now with Danny Rose back this is less of an issue, Rose incidentally plays like Alves' fullback partner, Jordi Alba, it's actually a very accurate comparison!

But, back to the main point, Walker is fantastic and him and Rose together stand to benefit greatly from Spurs more attacking intentions, but they need the centerbacks to get healthy and they need Sandro back because Spurs are essentially 2-4-4 in possession and prone to get caught out, a proper defensive mid would keep them in a safer 3-4-3 possession formation, guarding against the counter long enough for one or both of Rose and Walker to recover their position.

Spurs should seriously consider switching to a 3-4-1-2 when they are back to full health and playing against two striker systems, this would allow Spurs to field Rose and Walker as wide mids with a midfield three of Sandro/Capoe, Paulinho/Dembele and Eriksen/Holtby/Siggy. It would also allow Lamela to play off a more traditional striker with little to no defensive duties and only leaves Townsend and Lennon without natural spots in the squad.

Walker perhaps best exemplified his midfield qualities yesterday as his charts from that game show him essentially playing in a midfield role:

Walker's heat map, essentially spent the bulk of the game in midfield, he was in WBA final third more than his own:
 http://i.imgur.com/h0KQAtq.jpg?1

That heat map comes from where his passes where played but also where he did his defensive duty. All three of his tackles were in the midfield areas, as were both of his interceptions. 

He also popped up with two shots from just outside the box in central positions, his three take ons(one successful) and three crosses(one successful) were all done in the final third as well.

And finally, his passing chart, shows him spraying passes all over from a wide midfield position. 
http://i.imgur.com/nJhOqvK.jpg?1

He's Spurs best fullback and their best midfielder at the same time. I would even dare to say he could be fielded in a 4-2-3-1 as one of the '2' along Sandro, he would push on into midfield with his pace and support attacks and track back to help Sandro defend, he could play a role similar to Ramires with Chelsea. And he's shown, I think, that he can pass well enough to play in the middle was well.

There is something to be said for pulling a Phillip Lahm with Walker, taking someone who is so effective out wide and bringing them infield to see if they can exert even more influence over matches from a central position.",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,"Kyle Walker, Spurs Best Midfielder",41,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1ttisz/kyle_walker_spurs_best_midfielder/

The big revelation of his grave, contained inside the TARDIS ruins, with its ""scar tissue"" that enables time travel, exploration of the Doctor's lives and time, would have fit seemlessly, in my opinion. 

The xmas episode, therefore, could've been called ""The Name of The Doctor"". No further changes would be necessary in my naming convention as the previous finale would have served as a moment of foreshadowing to the resolution of the regeneration cycles. That might've made more sense in my opinion. 

My reasoning: The name is what Clara said into the crack - to those on Gallifrey - to which rejuvenated and saved the Doctor from a final, terminal death. The name was the key to this episode. It was holding Gallifrey at bay. It was perpetuating the unfolding of events and what ultimately enabled a further regeneration. Clara, once again, like in ""The Day Of The Doctor"" saved the day. 

In the xmas special, the name became a bigger factor as it's repression is the reason for the entire arc from the introduction of 11 in ""The Eleventh Hour"" (actually, since the events in the library where River Song first appears). 

Perhaps more will be unfolding that discredits my opinion and makes me look foolish... But I await those episodes and will enjoy the ride.

Maybe 20k and 30k are expensive, but looking at the cost of colleges in America and after discussing with Dad on maximum tuition, that deal looks very good to me, especially for the quality of education. 

Question 2: 

I know at American universities/colleges you basically get in to the engineering school, pick a specific major, and go. Is it the same at Oxford? Is there a test I have to take or something?

Dortmund asking for 40 million for Reus, should we try to pick him up? 

We missed out on Diego Costa in the summer and Willian,  both around the 30 million mark. Reus is more than a proven goal scoring midfielder in one of the biggest leagues in the world. If we were to get him I think we would line up somewhat like... 

Suarez Sturridge

Coutinho sterling

**An Ode to Trenzalore**

The almost bloodiest battle

In all of time and space

In a town called Christmas

In the cold he embraced

All his past presentations

And representations

Of justice and liberty

Through one occupation

Helping those in need

Counting countless victories

But when teardrop fall

Compassion becomes a vacavity

He neglects the loneliness

Building inside, the bliss

That once burned brightly

Gave a last goodbye kiss

Pretending to successfully thrive

In the solitude, his lie

Will not help him be happy

When he's run out of time

He never stops talking

About nothing, and walking

To outrun the cowardly

Acts that keep knocking

His hubris is the words he speaks

Binding him to be forever weak

He talks to dodge the question

That the universe comes to seek

The silence fell when he refused

He stopped running only to lose

In his battle to reign victorious

This man, the doctor, but doctor who?

Heartache created a hardened sore

When the men's prophecy swore

""The man who lies will lie no more

When this man lies at Trenzalore""

With nobody he could express

The feelings of true depress

Emptiness and loneliness

In the basement in the town Christmas

Oh but Trenzalore skies have shattered

Life is given to the dead man, tattered

And raggedy from saving worlds

He stands both beaten and battered

His life flashes before his eyes

An old friend, one last surprise

A final farewell before the bow tie fell

And the doctor continued his lives",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,An Ode to Trenzalore,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1ttxdu/an_ode_to_trenzalore/

And I found it was a wonderful send off for 11.  

Before watching, I was really depressed about 11 leaving (he's my favorite of the modern doctors), but after watching TOTD, I don't feel as sad.  Why?  Because he lived a full life.  I guess I was sad at the thought that he would just have one last quick battle and then die, but I was really happy to see that my favorite doctor was able to live a long life.  It may not have been a great life, but he lived it to the fullest and kept his personality intact.  Sure, I wish he had at least one more season, but I'm just glad he lived a long life.

As for people complaining about how fast-paced and disjointed it felt, I was totally fine with it.  People said that this one episode should have been stretched out for an entire season, but what if it was supposed to?  I remember near the beginning of the year while series 7 was still on air, Matt Smith said in an interview that he was planning on staying for at least one more season.  But then just a few months later, Matt changed his mind and announced that he would be leaving at christmas.    Now this isn't official, but I'm sure Moffat had planned to close up all of 11's story gaps throughout series 8, but with Matt's sudden decision, he had to find a way to condense it all into one episode, and I think he did a great job.   

Some people also wished that the episode was a two-parter.  But in all honesty, I don't see how they could have made the episode any longer, let alone make the premise of the story (closing all the loose ends of 11's tenure) last a whole season.  I felt the answers we got were good.  I'm glad they didn't go into long speeches or scenes to explain each plot device, that would've been redundant and made the episode feel slow or sluggish.  I liked that it was sort of just passing remarks, they allowed the viewer to go ""oh, now that makes sense!"", without completely pulling them out of the episode itself.  It made me want to go back and watch the episodes with my new found knowledge.  They didn't need to be explained in elaborate detail, because we already knew most of the detail, just not the whole reasoning.

Trouble is, we don't get a lot of downtime, and I'd like to get him to watch it with me. I'm wondering what episodes (on netflix streaming or amazon prime) to show him to start him off without his mocking shutting it down. 
I've know my husband for over 20 years, and he has always mocked anything science fiction related (I'm not even sure how far it extends- there are exceptions...)I think his objection is to anything that is about plot tricks rather than character but I'm not really sure what the origin is and not sure I trust his self-reporting. 
 He claims to enjoy early Star Trek from a campy perspective, and liked Firefly and happily watched it. He loves LOTR, fwiw. Mocks later Star Trek, but mysteriously enjoyed Enterprise (the movie). 

He works in theatrical production, and appreciates a lot of things from that perspective. 


EDIT: he agreed to give it a try, maybe he'd like it. I tried Girl in the Fireplace, partly because I know he likes Moffat's writing in other shows. Anyways, he kept nodding off, and then said he still didn't like it because it was ""silly."" So... I give up.

The first time I met Brendan Rodgers, he had just become Liverpool manager. We were speaking about the future and he mentioned the possibility of me joining his coaching staff.

But I told him straight away I would be retiring at the end of the season, so our working relationship would only last 12 months.

I made my announcement public in February but a few weeks later, at Melwood, Brendan invited me for another conversation.

He asked me whether I would consider postponing retiring for another season. Again, my answer was ‘no’. I was set in my ways, content with the decision I had reached. Only one thing could have changed my mind.

It wasn’t the prospect of more appearances; it had nothing to do with another contract or anything like that. If I felt Liverpool were going to compete for the one honour that had eluded me — the Barclays Premier League — I would have said ‘yes’ in a flash.

At that time, I could only see Liverpool challenging for a top-four place. If I had been able to see  into the future, I would now be  preparing for tomorrow’s showdown with Chelsea.

Make no mistake, Liverpool are title contenders. They might be outsiders in the group that  contains Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea, but there should not be any doubts about my old club’s potential to go the distance.

Once Chelsea are out of the way, Liverpool will have played all of the top eight, bar Manchester United, away from home. December has been a demanding month, with trips to White Hart Lane, the Etihad Stadium and Stamford Bridge but they are in excellent shape.

Even if they fail to beat Chelsea, it wouldn’t be the end of the world.

Had you asked any Liverpudlian what they would have taken from that sequence, four points from nine would have been acceptable.

If they happen to end up with six, expectations will be soaring into the New Year.

Liverpool look like a proper team once more. No other club has matched their tally of 83 Premier League goals in 2013 — Manchester City are closest with 81 — while a return of 69 points from 36 games in the calendar year shows they are finding consistency.

It also shines a light on the job Brendan is doing. Compare those figures to 2012, the year Kenny Dalglish’s reign ended and Brendan took over. In 39 games through the year, Liverpool only picked up 46 points and scored 54 goals.

Things were not easy for Rodgers when he came in. Kenny is God to Liverpool fans and his name still gets sung every week on The Kop, even before they chant the name of the current manager.

This job was always going to test his character and capabilities.

Not everything worked for him straight away, either. His first two signings, Joe Allen at £15million and £11m Fabio Borini did not make the expected impact.

I was also a little sceptical about the style which he wanted the team to play: centre-backs splitting, both full-backs pushing high  up and the keeper comes out to operate like a sweeper — just as Barcelona do.

Liverpool have always played good, intelligent football but this was taking it to another level. I felt it was risky. Three games into the season, we faced Arsenal at Anfield and they took full advantage,  beating us 2-0. With that style, I didn’t see how we would ever grind out a result. But to Brendan’s credit, he and the team have evolved over the last year while remaining true to his principles.

Plenty of judges are good at saying in this country how we should play football on the floor and give young players a chance, yet when they get jobs, they don’t do anything about it. You couldn’t level that criticism at Rodgers.

He wants his teams to inflict ‘death by football’ but this year Liverpool have shown another side to their character. They are now flattening the teams they should do but they are just as adept at toughing it out.

It was said at the beginning of the season that second-half displays against Stoke, Aston Villa and Manchester United were not up to standard but I was encouraged by what I saw. Liverpool showed maturity and held on to the result, something I don’t think would have been possible 12 months ago.

Another aspect Brendan deserves credit for is how he has never ducked a big decision. He offloaded Andy Carroll. Popular players like Daniel Agger and Pepe Reina have found he isn’t concerned about reputations — Agger has been dropped, Reina was loaned to Napoli.

Luis Suarez has found that out, too. Rodgers handled the delicate situation in the summer superbly, sending Luis to train on his own after he had stepped out of line.

He also criticised him last season when he admitted to diving yet, despite all that, he has coaxed out the best form of Luis’s career.

Clearly there has been a benefit from not having to deal with European competition this season — as Jose Mourinho has not been shy to point out — but Liverpool have still had to go and get the results to keep them among the pacesetters.

For Brendan to be an unqualified success at Liverpool, he will need trophies and regular Champions League football and those  objectives are as difficult to achieve as they have ever been in the last  20 years.

It will be 24 years next May since Liverpool were last champions but even if they don’t end that hoodoo, one thing is beyond doubt: Brendan Rodgers is building a team that has given Liverpool supporters their pride back — one that is a threat to all.

No matter who the manager is, no matter who the coaches are and no matter which players come in, we will struggle.


Why? It's quite simple. Lerner did not appoint appropriate people with real knowledge of football and aston villa. It cost him when nobody stopped O'Neill spending vast sums on average, ageing players, which has led to Lerner spending £250 million of his own fortune propping us up. It cost him in the subsequent terrible managerial appointments, and a total lack of continuity or direction in style of play.


The plan is to recoup as much as possible of the money he has spent on Villa, then sell the club. Allegedly he is looking for 200-250 million, which is not remotely realistic. The way he seems to be recouping money is bringing the wage bill right down, buying young cheap players and selling them at a profit after we've improved them. You thought it was all Lambert's plan? Think again. Maybe Lambert is comfortable implementing it but it's exactly what Lerner needs him to do.


This leaves us with a worrying scenario. How long will it take for Lerner to recoup enough money to convince him to sell at a lower price? We are only just breaking even and we are barely coping with a wafer thin squad devoid of proven quality. How long will it be before he realises he cannot recoup a significant amount of his money? Would relegation force him to cut his losses? How long would it take him to find the right buyer, how many decent buyers would want to invest in Villa, and does he even have the knowledge to pick the right man to sell to? If his managerial appointments are anything to go by I have little faith in his ability to read the intentions of a potential owner.


In short - no. What Lambert is serving up right now is not good enough and I worry about his ability to manage the team. But I worry far more about how much longer we will have to endure the ownership of Randy Lerner. He ran the Cleveland Browns and their fans into the ground before eventually selling when it suited him.

When she was first introduced over a year ago, I was honestly excited... for 1 minute.  I thought the entire concept was fantastic: a dalek that went insane after surviving the Doctor's ""inferno"", and now it honestly believed it was a human girl.  (or so I assumed)
 
Now the Doctor (having moved on, centuries after he waged war and slaughtered millions of daleks in fire and rage) comes face to face with a soldier/victim from ""the other side"" of the war.  He moved on and became a new man, while this dalek has been chained and imprisoned with nothing but it's insanity for the same amount of time.  And OH, THE IDEAS that filled my head when it was revealed!  She was the new companion?  No doubt the Doctor will use some science-ey way to bring the dalek with him, care for this sick creature, and find a way to give it the human body it thinks it has.  
 
So now we have the walking, talking CLARA OSWALD, a once-murderous dalek that fought the Doctor himself when he was at his most horrific, went insane amidst the slaughter, convinced itself it was a human girl, and was shown pity by the Doctor who took her in, gave her a human body, and now accompanies him as his companion and learning to accept that she's human, despite her true origin (alongside the Doctor himself, who must learn that A. She is/was his greatest enemy, and that their species have been at war across time. B. When he was the War Doctor, he fought and killed in the war, just as she did, but they're both different people now, and mirror each other almost perfectly, and C. It has always been his hope that the Daleks could change and be a force for good.  If he can just help this one Dalek, now in a human body and wanting to be human like in it's delusion, then he could truly be what he chose to be since the beginning; a healer.  The Doctor).  
 
The Doctor has run away from them, frustrated them, sabotaged them, openly fought them, killed them, talked them into suicide, became a TimeWarLord and waged war and ended millions of them, and even now continues to kill them wherever they reappear, despite his pleas.  For the first time in all his lives, he might actually be able to help just ONE of them.  For the first time in all Doctor Who history: just one success.  Just one.
 
All of this flashed in my mind when the Asylum episode premiered, and he finally found Clara in her cell.  Untold episodes flashed in my brain, all at once.  And it was glorious...for 1 minute.  Then we were told Clara actually WAS human, and was simply converted.  POOF!  All my ideas: gone.  And then the episode finished telling it's story.  And then it was over.  And I was... utterly deflated.
 
I had this wonderful moment of hope, excitement and wonder at all the fantastic stories this ""Clara"" character could inspire... and it all happened in one minute.  Then it was made redundant.  Killed.  All the ideas, swimming in my head, drowned as the actors spoke their lines and finished the scene.  No Clara the Dalek.  No Doctor &amp; The Dalek Girl.  No amusing scenes with Amy/Rory helping Clara adjust to her human life in the Tardis.  All gone.  The future... I saw it, and now it never happened.  And it still makes me sad.
 
Still here?  Wow.  Thanks for sticking around.  This has been rattling in my head for over a year, and if I didn't write it all out, I don't think I could get any closure and move on.  Now that I've put thought to type, I think I can get on with my life.  New Doctor.  New series.  The old is gone.

 I watched a few videos of previous regenerations and noticed that they seem to become more and more volatile as the show progresses. 

My theory is that with each regeneration in each cycle a time lords body becomes less in tune with the regeneration process, meaning that it requires more power and regeneration energy to actually regenerate. Matt Smith's first regeneration in the episode occurs after he receives another Regeneration cycle from Galliefrey, the resulting regeneration was powerful enough to wipe out the entire Dalek fleet, but it only succeeded in making his body young again.

I think that was his body burning off the rest of his previous cycle so it could assimilate with the new one, and given that it was a new cycle it was much more focused, which is what I believe caused the *Snap* regeneration.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,My theory on the swift regeneration of Matt Smith to Peter Capaldi.

I think all Spurs fans were reminded just how much the team missed him during his injury.

**Kyle Walker**

For much of the same reasons as Rose, he had yet another excellent game and has continued to be the team's most consistent and reliable player. Also looked dangerous going up the wing, often doing seemingly double duty as winger and RB (like Rose on the left). The combination of Walker and Rose on the wings adds an excellent dimension to our attack.

**Christian Eriksen**

Similar to Rose, took another great step in the right direction following his return from injury. Played the full 90 minutes, scored an excellent free kick goal, and overall had a solid game (which is all you can really ask for from a player returning from injury). He deputized at CM fairly well too, helping out on defense and running all over the pitch. Definitely more to improve on (a few poor passes here and there, plus giving away the foul that led to the West Brom goal), but Eriksen is on the right track.

**Losers**

**Vlad Chiriches**

Definitely a forgettable game. Chiriches looked out of sync from the start, often getting caught in possession or letting his mark go. West Brom's goal could largely be attributed to him letting his mark go as well. Chiriches has above-average footwork for a CB, but he possibly relies on it more than he should to wriggle out of situations rather than take the easy pass. He will need to work on his sloppy habits if he wants to keep his starting position when Vertonghen returns from injury.

**Sigurdsson and Chadli**

They get mentioned together, because they were essentially equally impotent on offense today (and for the same reasons). Both were mostly invisible, and essentially spent the game watching Rose and Walker play their positions. With Lamela still struggling to find consistency, and Townsend/Lennon stuck on the injury list, they need to take better advantage of these starts if they want to stay relevant when the injury list thins out. Both were pushed off the ball easily, and didn't look confident at all. Chadli especially has no reason to be getting pushed off the ball like that.

I feel we've lost crucial aspects of who he is, and it makes me worried about the future of the show.

My love for the Doctor has always been due to his complexity. He has always been good--brave, kind, and wise--a savior of individuals and worlds. Yet he has his flaws. He selfishly takes companions with him who he knows will be in danger as a result. He doesn't visit his companions once they leave him (*""Friends are people you stay in touch with. Your friends never see you again once they've grown up. The old man prefers the company of the young, does he not?""* - The Dreamlord). He always has to be in the action and doesn't stick around unless things are interesting. He carries the sorrow of his actions during the Time War with him wherever he goes. And, significantly, the Doctor is alone. The last of his kind.

These flaws are what make his character relatable. They give him depth and complexity.  

In the last few episodes, we've seen the end of this Doctor. He has overcome his flaws. It turns out he has nothing to regret from the Time War. He rescued Gallifrey and is no longer the last of his kind. And in the town of Christmas, for the first time, the Doctor stayed. He disregarded his need to run and instead dedicated centuries of his life to the protection of a small village. 

Without his flaws, the Doctor is unattainable, a godlike being of unimaginable goodness. It seems this is the Doctor we have to look forward to now. And that makes me terribly sad.

**Edit:** My understanding of the Doctor's character is undoubtedly hampered by the fact that I've yet to see more than a few episodes of Classic Who. Perhaps before the Time War the Doctor's character was different and yet still relatable.

Capaldi's one real line (other than ""Kidneys! I don't like the color"") was:

""Do you happen to know how to fly this thing."" 

Matt Smith's series made a big deal out of ""Only the Doctor can fly the Tardis"" and when River Song could, that was a big clue something was up. (Indeed, that Tasha Lem could makes me think that Lem's a reconstructed River, somehow...) 

Then I remembered Eleven''s Big Farewell Speech: ""I will not forget one day of this."" 

I think that's **exactly** what happened with Twelve.

Twelve doesn't know he's the Doctor.  Going through a new cycle of regenerations really kinda fried his whole brain. 

Twelve's big task: To return Gallifrey to the universe, might seem simple.  All he has to do is answer the question near a crack.  But...

""On the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the eleventh, when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, a Question will be asked, a question that must never, ever be answered.""

Seeing as it was indeed the fall of the eleventh, The Name of The Doctor certainly seems to be what this prophecy was talking about. The truth field prevented people from speaking falsely. Got it. The Time Lords were asking ""Doctor Who?"" so they would know they could come back to the universe. Got it. It can't be answered because it would reignite the Time War. Got it. Silence therefore must fall in order to prevent the question from being answered.

But living beings certainly could fail to answer. The Doctor did for centuries. That's pretty significant. To me, the whole point of the prophecy was that The Doctor would be *forced* to give his name. As it happened, it was much easier for him to just keep quiet. I feel like that just got blown over.

My second quibble is less important, but it's bugging me. 

**Regeneration:**

When The Doctor was ""dying"" at Lake Silencio at the beginning and end of Series 6, he started to regenerate. This bothered me in the first place, because the Teselecta isn't actually a Time Lord, but I could accept it as The Doctor channeling regeneration energy out through it to trick people. (Also, he is way too nimble in those episodes. In Let's Kill Hitler, the Teselecta is a stiff, expressionless robot.) Later, in The Angels Take Manhattan, The Doctor uses regeneration energy to heal River's arm. 

Now, apparently, The Doctor never had any regenerations left in the first place. That screws things up a bit. Lake Silencio can be perhaps explained away as some special technology the Teselecta was using, but River's arm can't. I've heard it described as him having some ""leftover"" regeneration energy, but that brings up some problems too. Do Time Lords get twelve and two thirds of a regeneration? Or do they use up more or less regeneration energy depending on how severely their bodies are damaged? If that's the case, it seems that some Time Lords could regenerate more than twelve times, and others could regenerate less.

I'm almost certainly over-analyzing the regeneration bit, but I'm irritated with the prophecy. I was really intrigued by how The Doctor would get out of it, because it seemed really airtight, but in the end it was disappointing.  That being said, I loved the episode, and I love Steven Moffat. Still, I feel like this is a case of him aiming too high and, while doing a fine job, not quite meeting the mark.

Also, it didn't seem like there were any fields in this episode.

**edit:** Maybe I missed it, but I also don't understand why The Doctor regenerating suddenly made it possible for him to leave without dooming the town.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Two continuity issues I have with the Christmas Special (obviously spoilers).,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1tv94z/two_continuity_issues_i_have_with_the_christmas/

An uncharacteristically low-scoring round sees **swagswag** take advantage to move up to the top spot for the first time. **Slumdog Mignolet** slip to third, and **Spoon FC** are back into second place. Joey Barton's Visa are the top scorers with a relatively modest 61. **K-Town Bloods** enter the league straight in the top 20, while **Pomp_f**'s entry down at the bottom narrows the gap that **Yadayadayada Toure** and **McLovinEverton** have to close to just over 200 points.

Only two teams have reached their personal best positions - the afore-mentioned **swagswag** in 1st, and **Golden State United** in 8th. And they only joined the league last week.

####Biggest movers:
Very little to speak of this round. **FC SLOB** rose by 7 places to 51st and **Joey Barton's Visa** are 5 places higher than they were last time, but no other team managed to better their position by more than three spots. In fact only 18 teams in total managed to improve on their last round's position. And while many many more teams slid down the table (largely due to new entrants), only **Hybrid Rainbow** and **Maddogs** dropped by as much as 5 places.

The code to join in is **375561-306516**, and if you fancy looking at your team's past positions, I keep track of them in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak5ieGUOod7fdDJaV0RmYzB2YVBiZk96VGxDMlQtN3c#gid=0).

###Match facts: Head-to-head
* West Brom have only won one of the last nine Premier League meetings (W1, D4, L4).
* West Ham and West Brom have had a different manager in charge for each of their five previous Premier League meetings at Upton Park. Sam Allardyce will be the first manager to break that run.
* Four of the last five matches in the league have been drawn.

In the 2nd half of the season, Liverpool play the equal most home games against top 9 opposition out of the current top 9 teams. Is this an advantage? In theory, the teams with less home games should get more points as they are playing more teams out of the top 9 at home. Liverpool will lose on the road again this season so we will have to win at least 4 or 5 of those home games to keep up.
On the other hand, it could be an advantage to take points of rival teams by beating them at home.

Honestly i don't quite know what to make of this. Discuss.

I realise we still have Kone, but for me he is past his prime and has maybe one season left in him. There is the possibility that we try and pick up Lukaku permenantly, but it seems unlikely we will be able to reach the price Chelsea will undoubtedly want. That leaves us with two options, we search for a replacement now or later, I believe we should start sooner rather than later, so we can begin merging them with the side and have the back-up for Lukaku. But who would we go for? If we were to wait until the end of the season and we worked hard and finished top 4, I believe we may have the position to persuade someone like Costa to come to the boys in blue, but again there is the money issue. Keissling wouldn't be too bad, but he is getting old and not many seasons remain in him, plus he would be against leaving Levurkusen. 

Sorry for the wall of text. COYB!

I'm a foreigner who's spent 10 years living in the UK, 6 years in London (well, Wimbledon) and 4 years in Cornwall. I moved abroad as recently as August but I swear it was never as bad as it feels on this sub. Then again I was lucky enough to live in a sea-side town in Cornwall and I realise that we have a very isolated little bubble down in Kernow that doesn't really compare to the rest of the country but is it really that terrible up country?

And if it is so bad, what with the excessive commuting, ridiculous house prices, internet censorship, inadequate government etc., why don't more Brits try their fortunes abroad? 

Just wondering. I loved living in England, particularly Cornwall (maybe I was lucky to have lived in two of the nicest places in the country) but the more I watch the news, read the papers and visit /r/unitedkingdom the less I want to come back to England like I had originally planned.

I personally wouldn't mind Diego Costa. He is brilliant, tall and young (25). Plus his release clause is £32 million.

Lets analyse other options:

1. Marco Reus: His release clause in 2015 will be 35 million euros but Dortmund are willing to sell him for £42 million this window. I personally 
think he is over rated and inconsistent.

2. Radamel Falcao: Arguably the best ""pure"" striker. However he is old (atleast 29) and will cost more than £45 million. On the plus side he has
hinted he wants to play for Mourinho  

3. Robert Lewandovski : Again a world class player. Would love him at Chelsea however his mind is set at joining Bayern.

4. Thomas Muller: With Lewandowski joining Bayern, Muller's play time might be limited at Bayern. He is a world class player, works extremely hard 
and is only 24. He is extremely versatile and i would personally love to see him in blue.

Realistically the premier league strikers are out of the question. Good strikers are rare, however we desperately need one. Which one do you want

Despite his unfortunate injuries, Kelly had performed very well at right-back, and the complaints from most were whether he could offer enough going forward. I always rated him as very solid defensively, dependable, not prone to errors, and seemingly unaffected by pressure at his young age. I am unsure if Rodgers feels the same, but seeing as he was originally a centre-back, I think he would be a decent option. Sakho and Skrtel have been strong, but Skrtel's last minute tackles (though wonderfully done) are a risky thing to depend on and seem to be stemming from a lack of positioning, though this could easily be the fault of Sakho, Cissohko, or Johnson. Also a bit worried about his attempts to pull off people's tops. Illori is still very young, but as Skrtel and Agger age, it wouldn't be a bad idea to explore our future centre-back rotation.

**Sakho-Kelly**: Both young, strong defensively, decent ball-playing skills. Seeing as Kelly can perform on the right, this solves the conundrum of the Sakho-Agger pairing. The negative is youth and lack of experience, which Skrtel and Agger both offer, but with Lucas operating in front of them, it could be feasible.  
**Agger-Kelly**: Seeing as Agger has dropped in form, and there has been concern about his aerial abilities, especially on set pieces, I doubt this would ever happen. I still think it could be an interesting pairing, especially if Agger's form improves and he returns to the starting line-up.  
**Kelly-Skrtel**: Could Kelly play as the LCB? Maybe. Maybe pigs could fly. If you tied them to a glider or something. I could be horribly mistaken however. He at least pulls shirts less.  
**Johnson-Sakho-Skrtel-Kelly**: Honestly think this would be a great option. A Dalglish throwback, full-back positions of Johnson on the left and Kelly on the right. With Flanno carrying an injury, I think we all get pretty nervous seeing Cissohko starting. When Kelly is fit, I think he deputises extremely well and would allow Sterling more freedom to operate on the right. Glenno is still a fantastic right-back (despite people's recent criticism), and I believe he would offer a lot more stability than Cissohko on the left. His abilities going forward could help Coutinho to move more central during overlaps, the part of the pitch we'd all like to see Coutinho in to begin with.

This of course is all ignoring several variables, including Enrique's return, formations, and etc. Seeing Lucas' mobility lessen over time, I even wondered if it would be worth exploring Martin Kelly as a DM. He has greater mobility, is not bad on the ball, and I've already discussed his defensive prowess. Even when Sturridge returns and we see the return of the 3-5-2 (unlikely), I think throwing Kelly into that trio would be a fantastic idea. Was bored and just wanted to share my thoughts, even though no one asked to hear them, and would appreciate anyone else's thoughts on the matter, or insults, or whatever, especially from someone who is astute tactically. In what could be a brief period between potential Martin-Kelly-esque injuries (hopefully not), I thought this might help the boredom until Sunday kick-off (unless you're tuning in and praying to a deity for a Norwich victory).",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,default,Kelly at Centre-Back?,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1tvmko/kelly_at_centreback/

I might read the Guardian, the telegraph or the economist online; and then take a look at the daily mail for some amusement and pretty good photojournalism (and sports coverage).

Since the guardian have begun targeting Australia (and to an extent the USA); and the Mail mainly the USA, I've found myself reading through articles presumably primarily targeted to those countries.

I'll read an editorial piece and halfway through see it's intended for an Australian audience.  I'll read through a USA-focussed article and notice that it lacks the usual context-setting you would expect had it been intended for British readers.

With the Guardian you can see Australian articles popping up in the main UK edition if you read the site using their App in the morning.  The Daily mail is particularly amusing, as they have some solid NFL coverage with a comments section of confused Brits 'what the hell is this?'.  Likewise I see debates on the Mail's more general news, between people from some US state and a town in the UK.

What's apparent is that even these 'national' newspapers are becoming more international.  I find myself going from knowing nothing about Australian politics/issues to knowing at least something.  Likewise the strength of coverage from the USA is increasing.

As the newspapers continue to target these english-speaking markets, I see a marked decrease in coverage of European issues; and also a normalisation/generalisation in the focus of articles - it's more cost effective to write an op-ed piece that can be read by Australia, UK and USA and make sense, then to bother with a more local piece.

Is this part of some over-arching plot to keep the english speaking western countries aligned!  :)  Or is it simply a matter of cost - and we will be forever reading stories about Queensland and Delaware?

**Talking Points**

*  Lack of youth players.  Winning mentality or short termism?

*  Boyata's performance.  A young lad needing to impress this season, did he do well in the right back slot? 

*  Edin Dzeko.  Bosnian Diamond scores again but what is his long term future?

*  Style of play.  23 shots with 4 on target.  Missing Aguero or over keen?

*  Joe Hart.  Re-established himself firmly now?

*  Jovetic.  The next Roque Santa Cruz?

The arguements that I'm reading are

A) Capaldi is the 13th regeneration, which would still make him the last doctor, after recieving the gift of life from the timelords. 

B) that he is the first of a whole new regeneration cycle, making him the first of twelve new doctors to come. 

I would almost prefer the second option, as it means we dont have to go and revisit the 'last regeneration' idea again at the end of Capaldi's run, and that it closes that storyline for the forseeable future.

As the showrunner of a series with a long-standing mythos, Moffat has an obligation to honor that tradition, hold true to the rules that govern the Whoniverse, and make sure that the characters act in a consistent, logical way.

But I think maybe we’ve taken it too far. I’m not saying that the Who fandom is particularly bad about this or that we’re the only ones who do it. What I’m saying is that maybe our enjoyment of Doctor Who should stem from the why rather than the how. Let’s face it: even the most basic tenets of Who mythology were made up on the fly. Why name him the Doctor? He needs to have authority. Regeneration? William Hartnell was leaving, so we’ll cook up something space-wacey to bring in a new guy.

To me, Doctor Who – and, by extension, most of fantasy and even some science fiction - is more about the emotional core of the story rather than the logic that holds it together. And to be honest, Doctor Who has always leaned more towards fantasy than sci-fi. It’s about the beauty of the world, the joy of adventure, and the celebration of what it means to be human. It doesn’t matter how the TARDIS works, but the freedom it represents is paramount.

In “The Time of the Doctor,” the Eleventh Doctor’s aging process during his centuries-long vigil on Trenzalore makes absolutely no sense from a perspective of internal consistency. Eleven spends a couple hundred years in this incarnation and never even gets so much as a grey hair until he starts his defense of Christmas? No dice. But that doesn’t matter. What matters is that we see the Doctor for what he is: a tired, broken old man at the end of his rope with no more tricks up his sleeve. Is it subtle? Nope. But it serves as the keystone of Eleven’s story arc, and ultimately it’s more about the truth of the moment rather than the clockwork underneath it. 

You could say that the blink-and-you-miss-it regeneration from Smith to Capaldi was due to the fact that his regenerations had been reset and that the first of his new batch would be cleaner and less violent. While it works as head-canon, it’s far more likely that Moffat was trying to bring about a sense of shock, either to showcase the Eleventh Doctor’s “Geronimo” personality one last time as he dives headfirst into his new incarnation or even as a way of saying, “Here’s the Twelfth Doctor and he’s coming in like a wrecking ball!” (I can never apologize enough for that choice of words.) While it may sound cynical, I seriously doubt that Moffat was breaking a sweat over the rules of regeneration when writing that last scene. His goal was to give Smith a fitting farewell, not demonstrate the logistics of a fictional biological process.

At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter exactly how the Doctors seal Gallifrey away into a pocket dimension; what matters is that a man who’d spent years living in regret was given a chance to fix his biggest mistake, and ultimately found another way. It doesn’t matter how Clara survived a trip through the time vortex; what matters is that – like every companion before her – she’s the kind of person who will hold on and never give up the Doctor. It doesn’t matter whether or not Eleven’s vision of Amy was a hallucination brought about by the effects of his impending regeneration; what matters is that a man who had spent his entire life refusing to face the last page and dreading the very idea of change could finally look at an end and find peace instead of despair.

Arguing head-canon and official-canon and quasi-canon until you’re blue in the face is fine and can even be fun, but it should never be the focus. And while I don’t think Doctor Who should just completely abandon logic (for the record, I have my own issues with Moffat’s writing and think he has dropped the ball in several places), I do think Doctor Who should be more about the raw emotion than the rules. Maybe I’ve got it all wrong, but I’ve always seen Doctor Who as the exception that proves the rule – it’s a carnival of the ridiculous, of the silly, of the fantastic and the bizarre: an epic tale of a daft old man who stole a magic box, a story that can mean so much and so many things to so many different people.

No doubt this little speech was a tidbit by Moffat as a way to say ""We make the rules as writers and storytellers, and we can do whatever we want at any time.""

As for the introduction of Capaldi, his age is an issue. So the entire episode with Matt Smith aging was more or less to aid in the transition to an older Doctor.

At the end of season 6 he travels for approximately 200 years before confronting the astronaut on the beach, and doesn't appear to age at all. Yet in TOTD he becomes an old man in ~300 years. This puzzled me somewhat, as I'm sure it puzzled others.

Then the idea came to me: what if time travel somehow stunts a Timelord's ageing?  This could explain why the Doctor claims to be immortal (I believe 10 says something along these lines in School Reunion); because time travel essentially grants them that ability? Could this be another aspect as to why the Doctor never spends too much time in one place? Another reason why he's always running? Perhaps this was also a reason the Timelord's took to time travel in the first place?

In The Name of the Doctor, we witness the Doctor stealing the Tardis as an old man, not a young one. So perhaps he aged as Gallifreyans do naturally up until that point when he took up time travel? And then we flash forward to TOTD and the Doctor finally has no choice but to stay in one spot, which triggers his ageing once again.

I've also read a good portion of Vampire Science but I didn't really enjoy it and never finished it.

And I've heard McGann's audio series are a high point, which is what started me down this whole path.

Ideally, I'd like to cover anything that's currently considered canon to New Who. I was thinking just doing the Big Finish audio stories and the Eighth Doctor adventure novels. But I'd like to avoid the more unnecessary books; I'm too slow a reader to commit my time to a book I'm not enjoying and I really feel like the time I spent on Vampire Science was wasted.  
If I was to read the novels, which books should I read? I've read about Compassion the companion on the wiki and I definitely want to check out the books following her arch. I could also just read the highest rated novels and read summaries of the rest so I'm not completely lost.  
As for the audio dramas, should I just stick to the Big Finish ones? If so, should I bother with the monthly series or should I just stick to the ""Eight Doctor Adventures""?

And finally, what order should I do all this? Chronologically by the story or by production release? Should I do the novels first, then the dramas? vice versa? Or do the two of them never reference each other and I can safely alternate between them?



PS. one last thing. If I'm going to be getting advice on what to read/listen to I should probably clear up what I enjoy in DW. I like Moffat's work as showrunner. I liked RTD's work but going back now, it feels kind of stale. I enjoy a good story even if its a bit cheesy. I watched a bit of Classic Who. Liked almost all of the 4th Doctor's stories that I saw but I couldn't get through the First Doctor's serials. I always prefer the technojargon nonsense sci-fi(I don't mind when plot holes are conveniently filled with techno sounding nonsense words) to the mystical kind of stuff (hated the Master's resurrection scene in TEoT)

PPS. Thank you in advance!

I really miss this old style, where they gave extra attention to bright lighting on the characters' faces and on the sections of the environment which are important during dark or night scenes. I find that with darker scenes of modern films, in order to see the detail I need to turn up the brightness on my screen to the point where the blacks are gray and the colors washed out, whereas with the older films there is a much better contrast which allows me to leave my screen settings at a point where the colors are much richer, and the blacks are pure.

The amazing shift was from, as the Moment called him, ""The Man who Forgets"" to the man who remembers. Compare these two quotes from the Doctor:

*Angels Take Manhattan*: ""I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings!""

*The Time of the Doctor*: ""We all change. When you think about it, we're all different people all through our lives.""

In fact, Clara reflects the way that 11 used to think. When talking to her grandmother in *TTOTD*, she tears up when her grandmother says,
""I wanted everything to stop. I wanted nothing to change ever again. If he could just keep standing there, so beautiful ... That’s when I knew of course.""

10 was racked with guilt and abandoned everyone he knew to save them from pain. Rose, Martha, Donna… all of them ripped from his grasp and he knew he left them. He knew he couldn't be with them forever and he blamed himself for leaving them behind. His last words reflect that: ""I don't want to go"".

11 was indeed the man who ""forgets"" for close to his whole tenure. He never spoke of the time war except in times of dire stress. He dissociates from his past life as the War Doctor, speaking of that time as outside himself:

""There's one life I've tried very hard to forget. He was the Doctor who fought in the Time War and that was the day he did it. The day I did it. The day he killed them all.""

And then, when asked about counting the children he killed, he denies it:

The War Doctor: Four hundred years older than me and in all that time you never even wondered how many there were? You never once counted?

Eleven: Tell me. What would be the point?

Ten: Two point four seven billion.

The War Doctor: You did count!

Ten: You forgot? Four hundred years? Is that all it takes? 

Eleven: I moved on.

Ten: Where? Where can you be now that you can forget something like that? 

The Doctor: Spoilers. 

Ten: No. No no no. For once I would like to know where I'm going.

The Doctor: No, you really wouldn't.

When Amy and Rory left, he traveled by himself, never speaking of them and trying to forget them. He runs away and isolates himself to protect his fragile heart:

From *The Snowmen*:
Madame Vastra: He was different once. A long time ago. Kind, yes. A hero even. A saver of worlds. But he suffered losses which hurt him. Now he prefers isolation to the possibility of pain's return. 

When River Song's ""backup"" speaks in the *Name of the Doctor*, he pretends not to hear her:

River Song: How are you even doing that? I'm not really here. 

The Doctor: You are always here to me, and I always listen. And I can always see you. 

River Song: Then why didn't you speak to me? 

The Doctor: Because I thought it would hurt too much. 

River Song: I believe I could have coped. 

The Doctor: No. I thought it would hurt me... and I was right. 

All of these forgotten regrets are buried and hidden and repressed to his last adventure... when he stops forgetting. He begins to live a life that he WANTS and chooses. His final words reflects the shift in his character:

The Doctor: It all just disappears, doesn't it? Everything you are, gone in moment. Like breath on a mirror. Any moment now, he's a coming.

Clara: Who's coming?

The Doctor: The Doctor.

Clara: You... you are the Doctor. 

The Doctor: Yep. And I always will be. But times change, and so must I. We all change when you think about it. We're all different all through our lives. And that's okay, that's good. You've got to keeping moving. As long as you remember all the people that you used to be. I will not forget one line of this, not one day. I swear. I will always remember when the Doctor was me.

And that is why Matt Smith will always be my Doctor. He was flawed, he was hurt, but he was REAL. I could see the pain that losing those he loved caused him and how desperately he buried it under naiveté and running… always running. And then he finally stopped running and faced his end with hope. I will miss you, 11. We will all miss you.

(Thanks to http://www.planetclaire.org for providing accurate quotes)

TL;DR: 11 is my Doctor and he was amazing

Where did he receive his PhD? I need to be assured that this Doc is a true professional and not some joke.

So, Clara kept telling him to change the future, and he said he couldn't without the Time Lords. 

She spoke with them through the cracks, and told them to help him, so they granted him another round of regenerations. 

This changed the future, and deleted the one in which he dies on Trenzalore (whether in battle or from old age), and thus the world they visited in the Name of the Doctor no longer exists (with the giant Tardis). 

This means that since he didn't die there (presumably he doesn't go back and die there far into the future in another regeneration, though I suppose that would probably solve this question), his grave is not there, his timestream rift isn't there, and so Clara wasn't ever able to enter it.

Consider this ENTIRE thing a spoiler. I don't want to spoiler tag the entire post.**  
  

I have been extremely disapointed with where the series is heading, especially where the last two episodes have taken it. There have been several issues in the past episodes, but none to this scale. It also doesn't help that these two series-ruining episodes were back-to-back. I will explain each seperately.

**50th Anniversary**  
It was neat fan service to have both Matt Smith and David Tennant in the same episode together. The idea of a regeneration he didn't acknowledge himself as the doctor was pretty good. That however is where my praise ends for this episode.  
This episode committed the #1 deadly sin of any sort of story telling: altering a major part of main story arc. And don't you dare call it a ""twist"", because a ""twist"" is something planned and if you go back you will notice evidence of it. I just rewatched the series, this change was not planned. It was pulled out of the ass. In new who, the end of Gallifrey is what set the story in motion and the effects of that event makes some key character traits in the main character.
  
**ToTD (aka Christmas special 2013)**  
Everything this episode did was shit, but what I'm most angry about is what it did to the storyline. Moffat committed storytelling deadly sin #2 here: careless twists. Meaning: he made a twist without considering how it fits in with past bits of the story. Making it so the cracks were Timelords were trying to reach back into the universe creates an incredible amount of issues throughout the story. The main one being that it was the Timelords' fault the universe was coming to an end by causing the TARDIS to explode, and The Doctor wants to bring them back. Also, if the all it took was someone to remember The Doctor to allow him the reenter the universe, then why can'y Gallifrey when obviously the majority of their enemies remember them. If it took a TARDIS, then timelords should have been popping up all over the place since, you know, they grew them!  
  
  -----  

Its impossible to express my disappointment in the series, or cover everything Moffat has ruined in just two episodes. He even ruined that parts that he himself wrote. You would think he would be capable of at least getting that right. If you had to ruin the story, couldn't you have at least given us a proper send-off to 11?

I see that near or at the end of Capaldi's time in the TARDIS, he will still not have found Gallifrey and will give up and let his last centuries alive leave him so he can die finally. 

As he sulks away to his death, he suddenly finds a new lead in helping him find Gallifrey. Now almost on his deathbed, he goes out in search for his long lost home one final time. 

As he closes in on home, he can feel his life leaving him, slowly, like a breath on a mirror. By the time he finds Gallifrey again and reinstates it to the universe once again, he is on his last breath.

The Time Lord High Council and all of Gallifrey, now in eternal thanks to the one who never stopped believing, grant the Doctor an eternal Regeneration Cycle, making him immortal.

What this something else could be is open to interpretation, because his brain is fairly muddled after regeneration. As far as I can tell it could be:

Obviously Gerrard and Lucas have their names on those positions and while maybe Lucas could lose his spot I doubt Rodgers will consider not starting Gerrard until at least next season. 

As such, I look through our first 11 and see no place where we can immediately improve ourselves that would make a massive impact WITHOUT sacrificing the development of one of our young guns. Suarez owns the CF position and obviously our top 3 interchange fluidly, but I feel if we get any good first 11 player it'd be at a position that would put either Coutinho, Sturridge, or Sterling on the bench for this season.

As far as I see it, the only way we can justify that is if it allows us to make CL. Which would then mean more games for everyone next season and all for rotation and a better squad.

But when I hear about guys like Salah I only think of Assaidi. Sure, maybe the lad will do be a hit but is he going to seriously improve on the outputs of Sturridge or Coutinho? I doubt it. 

At the beginning of the season I'd say sign Salah. That he was the perfect signing for us at the moment. But right now we have shown ourselves legitimate contenders for top 4, not to mention even higher. To secure that when Utd will strengthen and Tottenham will regroup we will need an impact signing. I really do think we need to splash the cash this window.

We can fill out our squad in the summer once we're in Europe. But right now we need someone big. And I'm just not sure who that'll be.

For me, my low would definitely be the sacking of Nigel Adkins. I was never worried about backing the new guy (Pochettino), but just the general format was such a disservice to Adkins and I believe the club. 
Honorable mention: The stock kits, though they have grown on me.

High's almost seem too numerous to mention: Scalping Man City last season, staying up, important transfers, early season form. I think I have to get philosophical and say I love how our players are progressing and adjusting to the premier league. That is probably what gives me the biggest smile, talent that did the job in league 1 is paying off in the prem, the academy is paying off in the prem, transfer targets are paying off in the prem. They are all learning and improving and developing into a truly quality squad. Anyways, Happy New Years guys, after today I will see yah in the second half of the season.

In my opinion it would have been even better if the time crack were in the same house but on The Moment itself. Because of that time crack, the whole thing was broken. 

Everything else would stay the same, except that with that change, The Doctor would stay again between a girl (Tascha Lem) and a box (The broken Moment/time crack)

And in the end Clara goes with him on that Tower while carrying the broken Moment with him with some sort of speech of resignation like he wanted to use the Moment to intimidate the Daleks but in the end he weren't able ""to fix"" it. 
The only thing that he couldn't fix in the end.

While he was talking to the Daleks, Clara talks again to the crack (like in the actual special). 

The Moments lifts of and flies infront of the Doctor, giving him the new regeneration cycle and closing the crack after that. 

He says Clara to hide somewhere else and then he would have his speech about the Daleks telling him the rules.

Issues
-----

- Which two reserve players should be promoted to the senior squad? (We only have 16 fit senior players).
- Do you have faith in Cissokho now, after his display at the Etihad?
- It is important for both sides not to lose: how will this affect the style of the game we're going to see? Will the bus be parked after a goal is scored?
- Will the fatigue of our players be notable?
- What are your scoreline predictions and preferred formations?
- __~~Sakho~~ Agger will play as left-back. How do you feel about this?__",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Pre Match Thread: Chelsea vs Liverpool,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1txs6f/pre_match_thread_chelsea_vs_liverpool/

I think the combination of my inebriation and - to be honest - finding the phone too small (due to using an SGS4 which is almost too big!) resulted in my fumble.

But it got me thinking. Why the fuck is that phone so fragile? I know maybe 2 people in the entire world who haven't got a cracked iPhone screen, and one of them has a big fucking metal case on it. It's like Apple (I see some cracked other-rands of phone but not half as severe) didn't account for the clumsy or drunk people at all. Imho if you're making a handheld device one of the first things you should start doing is dropping it in real life situations and seeing how badly it breaks. Maybe they did that, maybe that's why the screen works on my friend's iphone despite it being a million shards?

Anyway, the people were ok with it because of who the phone was calling to and ""accidents happen"" but fuck me if I didn't feel like a giant tit.

**Chelsea FC 2 - 1 Liverpool FC**
*Skrtel 3', Hazard 17', Eto'o 34'*


**ALL OVER. Chelsea pick up the three points**

*There's a set to as Oscar and Lucas come to blows after a two-footed challenge by the Chelsea man. Oscar was lucky to escape with only a caution there*.

90
We're in stoppage time and Chelsea are in the Reds' half and trying to run down the clock.

*Sakho is replaced by Kolo Toure.*

89
Torres has a chance to settle the game after weaving away from an injured Sakho but he can't find a way past Mignolet.

*Eto'o is suffering from cramp and goes off to be replaced by Torres*

*Johnson limps off to be replaced by Aspas*

81
Suarez is on the floor again appealing in vain for a penalty after a clumsy challenge by Eto'o. The Chelsea striker was lucky to get away with that one.

*Cahill flies into a challenge on Suarez and is cautioned for bringing the striker down in full flight. Cech punches the resulting free-kick away.*

77
Good run to the byline by Willian but he can't find the feet of Eto'o in the Liverpool box.

75
Hazard gets the better of Sterling and has a go with his right foot but drags his effort wide.

73
Suarez holds off Cahill and feeds Johnson who has a go with his left foot which is parried around the post by Cech at the expense of a corner. Coutinho takes but Chelsea clear.

70
Oscar wriggles into the Liverpool box and he goes for the corner with a curling right-footer which is just wide of the upright.

69
Free-kick taken by Luiz but he hammers the 25-yarder into the red wall.

68
Hazard looks to spin away with the ball but dogged defending by Agger denies him.

66
Sterling finding some space but Willian is working hard to keep the winger in check.

65
Liverpool pressing hard to get back on level terms here.

63
Suarez wins a free-kick after a seemingly innocuous challenge by Hazard. Coutinho swings the dead ball in with the Uruguayan striker going down under a Terry challenge. Webb waves penalty appeals away.

61
Good defending by Skrtel who gets across to deny a rampaging Eto'o. The corner goes all the way across the area without finding a head.

61
Smith tries a neat back flick but fails to find a teammate

*Enforced change for Liverpool as Allen goes on to be replaced by debutant Brad Smith. What a game to be thrown in to.*

58
Coutinho cuts in off the left but he goes for goal rather than looking for a colleague in a red shirt.

57
Chance for Suarez after being picked out well by Henderson but the Uruguayan's volley is straight at Cech.

55
Oscar wins a corner off Johnson. Terry and Cahill come forward but the Brazilian's delivery is poor.

53
Great save by Mignolet to deny Eto'o after the striker is found by Hazard. The Belgian stood big there to block the powerful strike.

51
OFF THE BAR: Quick free-kick is played to Henderson whose chip finds Sakho in space. His looping header comes back off the upright and the Blues are able to clear their lines. Cech was stationary and beaten there.

51
Hazard and Oscar combine well down the Liverpool left but the Brazilian's centre is poor and the Reds bring it away.

50
Clumsy foul by Agger on Oscar. The Dane has not been able to provide any threat going forward.

*Booking and a suspension for Luiz as he pulls Allen back.*

48
Decent spell of possession for Liverpool but they can't find an opening through Johnson.

47
Pause in play as Allen receives treatment for a blow to the head.

47
Pause in play as Allen receives treatment for a blow to the head.

*Terry gets a lecture from Webb after catching Allen in the face with a flailing arm and picks up a caution.*

*Lampard has picked up a thigh problem and is replaced by Mikel.*

The teams are on their way out for the second half. Jamie Carragher says it's the best Chelsea have been this season - and it's hard to argue with that verdict.

**That's the interval - and as the teams troop off Eto'o swaps shirts with Sakho. Surely you've got to wait until the end of the match for that ritual, boys.**

**Background:**  
Having dramatically survived relegation on the last day of the previous season, the 2007/08 season was going much more smoothly for West Ham United. Nearly halfway through their 38 games, the Hammers were sitting comfortably in 9th place with 26 points.  
  
Recent form had been reasonable. Having lost to Everton in the league and the cup, the Irons had bounced back to beat Middlesbrough before securing a point against Reading on Boxing Day.  
  
For the second year in a row, West Ham were to host top-of-the-table Manchester United. United had won five straight game and held a one point lead over Arsenal. Fergie’s men had regained the Premier League crown the previous season, but not before West Ham assured their survival by 1-0 and securing their place in the Premier League.   
  
The man who had scored the winner on the final day of that season, Carlos Tevez, was now returning to the Boelyn Ground with Manchester United. Just prior to kick-off, Tevez saluted the crowd by crossing his arms into Hammers. The crowd responded with delighted applause and chants of ‘There’s only one Carlos Tevez’.  

**The Match:**  
The first real chance of the game fell to West Ham. Hayden Mullins smashed against the Crossbar from a tight angle and the ball fell to Mark Noble, however he only managed to spoon the ball over despite an open goal.   
  
Manchester United were to make the Hammers pay for their wastefulness. A lovely quick move unleashed Giggs down the left who picked out Ronaldo to score from six yards, his 18th goal in 18 games.  
  
West Ham should have had a penalty soon after when Solano was pushed in the box, but nothing was given. Solano nearly had the last laugh ten minutes later, when he nearly scored with a brilliant long range effort that was tipped just over the bar.  
  
The second half nearly saw West Ham dead and buried when United were awarded a penalty. Ronaldo, so confident from the spot, smashed the ball only to see it go wide of Robert Green’s post. It was the fourth penalty faced by Green this season and it was the fourth penalty that had failed to find the net. 
With 15 minutes to go West Ham drew level. After winning a corner, Noble swung the ball in for Anton Ferdinand to head past the keeper and equalise for the Hammers.  Five minutes later and the match was completely turned on its head when Paintsil won a free kick. Once again Noble swung the ball into the box and Matthew Upson rose highest to head the ball into the top corner of the goal. Upton Park exploded with joy.  
  
West Ham held on for the last 10 minutes, and after never having beaten Manchester United in 16 years at Charlton, Curbishley won his third straight game against Sir Alex Ferguson.  

**Aftermath:**    
  
The win didn’t do much for West Ham. They remained in 9th place and, with 29 points, we’re in a healthy position for a top-half finish at the end of the season. 
The loss was more devastating for United who saw the end of their 5 game win streak and gave up first place on the table to Arsenal.

That's fine and she may end up being River in the end, but I'd be very surprised and here are my reasons why.  I'd love to hear if anyone agrees or disagrees and why!  First the things I saw in the episode that made it clear to me that Tasha is a separate person from River.

River is an atheist.  In *The Pandorica Opens* she tells the Roman soldiers that only fools believe in gods.  Tasha is the leader of a galactic religion.  Now, she wouldn't be the first religious leader to secretly be atheist, but most of those lost their faith after joining their religious organization.  It would be very hypocritical for someone who knows they're atheist to join a church hierarchy.  I know some aspects of a personality can change with regeneration, but their core tenets seem to remain intact.

If Tasha is a future River, why didn't she act like it in the episode?  Why did she ask The Doctor if his body, the one with which River was most familiar, was a new one?  If they were only pretending she wasn't River, why didn't they drop the charade when she and The Doctor were alone?  Why did they even talk about River in the third person?  Why didn't she contact The Doctor the instant she saw all of his ancient enemies massing?  And why did she let him get stuck on Trenzalore?  River has certainly never been one for giving up and accepting the future as written.

River is dead.  She died in the Library and her body decayed.  Yes, we've seen evidence that some part of her mind survived long enough to be an astral projection in *The Name of The Doctor*, but the gift of regeneration is a gift of the body, not the mind.  How is it possible for River to regenerate if her body died before it could regenerate?  Are we even sure River had regenerations left after *Let's Kill Hitler*?

Now to address some of the events of *The Time of The Doctor* which people have pointed to as evidence.  The name similarity is pretty flimsy in my opinion, it is there, but I don't think it's really solid evidence.  The fact that Tasha and The Doctor know each other and have a romantic history is not odd, he had lived over 900 years before meeting River for the first time, and we've seen that he had other loves.  River wasn't even his first wife.  Are we to assume that any woman with whom he becomes romantically involved must be River?  The Doctor says Tasha has been fighting ""the psychopath"" inside her all her life.  I will admit, the similar language here did give me pause; however, it is not wise to assume River is the only powerful/intelligent woman who has to fight with her own mental demons.  As one of my other favorite fantasy stories, *A Song of Ice and Fire*, points out, greatness and madness are often two sides of the same coin.  Then there's Tasha piloting the TARDIS.  It seems almost impossible, but we have to consider that Tasha and The Doctor were working very closely together for well over 300 years, and probably closer to 1000.  In all that time, The Doctor could very well have imparted some piloting tips.  The other variable to consider in this equation is the TARDIS herself.  Perhaps she either taught Tasha or just helped her complete that journey to get Clara.  The TARDIS has shown an uncanny ability to know exactly what The Doctor needs well before he does.  Perhaps the TARDIS knew Clara would be the one to save him.

This is just my two cents, though, and we've seen that anything is possible in the show, so I'm not completely writing it out of the realm of possibility.  I just think Tasha **probably** isn't River. :)",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,[Spoilers] Who Tasha Lem (probably) isn't.,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1txyry/spoilers_who_tasha_lem_probably_isnt/

##Gamecast:
----------------------
* The pitch is in absolutely terrible condition. Commentators spent a couple of minutes talking about how the goalkeeper areas as well as the corner flag areas are fairly muddy - something for the club to perhaps work on.
* The teams are heading out now.
* We're up against a fairly non-creative Stoke team with Sorensen in the side, so we've dodged the Begovic turning into Superman. Hopefully Sorensen doesn't have the same powers.
* Expect Stoke to be very direct, crosses in to Crouch and long balls to knock down for Walters and Crouch. Unfortunately, that's exactly what might be a big hindrance for us - dodgy Chiriches and a slow Dawson not exactly a happy sight.
* We're seconds away from kick off now.

[](//#whistle) **First half is underway!**

* 1 min: Really good start by Spurs.
* 2 min: **Paulinho** looking very solid on the ball so far, confidently exchanging passes with Eriksen and bringing play around the center of the field. Soldado is pulled down for a foul. Free kick from Eriksen, not quite from striking distance though.
* 3 min: Free kick amounts to nothing, not well struck. Walters goes down after him and Fryers have a tangle, didn't seem too serious but Walters seems to be in pain.
* 5 min: Spurs looking very lively up front. Ade, Eriksen, Dembele, Lennon and Soldado are all putting in a shift. These are good positive signs from Spurs, but we MUST MUST MUST make something of it. Too often we LOOK really good for 20 minutes but it does not result in goals.
* 8 min: **Adebayor** tracks back all the way to the half-way line to break up a Stoke counter-attack. Good stuff from Ade - showing a working mentality today.

**Just so you know how the first 10 minutes have gone, Spurs have had 71% of the possession, about 85% of it in the opposition half.** 

* 14 min: Dembele breezes past a couple of players and is brought down for a free kick.
* 15 min: In spite of Spurs playing so well, all the commentator can talk about is how bad Spurs are at home and how they can't score and basically suck.
* 15 min: **CHANCE MISSED!** Crazy through ball finds Lennon with acres of space, his cut back finds Ade in the box who doesn't find the right shot, scuffs it badly with his left foot and it's too behind Eriksen for him to do anything about it. What a shame.
* 16 min: **Paulinho** with a crazy flicked ball to find Soldado, the ball bounces for him to take his time and pick his spot, but the Spaniard shoots wide.
* 17 min: Commentators continue talking about how Spurs waste chances. Not biased at all.
* 18 min: **Adebayor** so far deserves a shout for being one of our best players on the pitch. He runs from our own half to the edge of the box, finds the right ball for Lennon to run onto but he's marked tightly. Corner.
* 22 min: Shout-out to **Dembele**, his pass completion rate has been 100%.
* 27 min: **Paulinho** has been exceptional so far. Him and Adebayor have been our best players. Fryers has been great going forward as well.
* 30 min: Dembele being Dembele today. So good to watch.
**Half an hour gone, we've looked very lively going forward but nothing to show for it yet. Exciting game. If you're not on the stream, probably try and find one. 65% of the possession has been Spurs so far.** 
* 31 min: Commentators now bashing Lennon for having no goals or assists. This is getting a little fucking annoying - can we start a petition to point out this blatant anti-Spurs shit?
* 33 min: **Two chances!** Great work from Lennon on the right, his chipped in cross is JUST over Soldado's head, the ball finds Fryers who sends it sailing into the box again, this time Soldado glances his header inches wide of the goal. Commentator's response? : ""After all of that, it's still 0-0."" Twat.
* 36 min: **PENALTY FOR SPURS!** Adebayor tries an audacious effort, but Shawcross raises his arms to block the ball and the ref gives away a penalty. Soldado steps up to take this one.
* [](//#ball) 37 min: **GOAL BY BOBBY THE SOLDIER! SOLDADO NETS IT IN WITH FUCKING CONFIDENCE! SPURS 1-0 UP DESERVEDLY!**
* 40 min: Nzonzi has dodged a bullet here. In typical frustrated Stoke style, he swipes out at Adebayor. Ref doesn't stop play though.
* 42 min: Oh dear! Paulinho finds space to take a shot after a bad pass from Stoke, but his shot is well high and wide. Deserves a goal today, Paulinho.
* 45 min: Single minute of added time - Spurs have absolutely dominated this half. Single goal cushion not enough however, we need to now think about scoring many more goals, getting the goal difference up.
* 46 min: Final play of the half sees some delightful interchange between Eriksen and Paulinho. Final finish not there. Has Sherwood found the winning combination with Eriksen and Paulinho for Spurs? It definitely feels like it right now.

[](//#whistle) **End of the first half!**

[](//#whistle) **Second half begins!**

* 48 min: Spurs on the front foot again, Eriksen takes a strike but it's tame, low and in Sorensen's palms.
* 49 min: Change for Stoke. [](//#up) Adam [](//#down) Ireland
* 51 min: [](//#yellow) Hahaha, wow Stoke just don't get it. **Dembele** with some glorious play to get past Walters about 4 times, eventually he's hauled down. Unfortunately though, in the aftermath of that Walters, Shawcross and Dembele are all booked. Don't ask.
* 52 min: This time however, Eriksen's free kick is too high. Earlier it was too low. Perhaps the next one will be just right.
* 54 min: Lloris has had barely anything to do all game, let's hope it stays that way.
* 58 min: **WHAT A MISS! SOLDADO MISSES A SITTER!** Lennon breaks free, nips the ball back for Soldado who is standing five yards from the keeper and can shoot on either side to score, but a madly tame effort bounces into Sorensen's hands. What a miss. What a miss.
* 62 min: Paulinho seems to have twisted his ankle, and will be coming off shortly.
* 62 min: Change for Spurs. [](//#up) Capoue [](//#down) Paulinho
* 63 min: Game most definitely has lost a lot of its first half vigor. Assaidi takes on Naughton but Naughton sticks out a leg to give Stoke their first corner of the game at 63 minutes. Says a lot about the game. Spurs break from a poor corner, Eriksen's ball too long for Ade.
* 65 min: [](//#ball) **DEMBELE SCORES FOR SPURS! WHAT SHOT** He just plays and toys with the Stoke defence at the edge of the area, finds some space, SMACKS the ball into the bottom corner. What a strike, what a goal! 2-0 up go Spurs!
* 68 min: Commentators still bitching about Spurs FYI. Now talking about how Dembele should be scoring more. (Sigh)
* 69 min: Change for Stoke. [](//#up) Pennant [](//#down) Palacios
* 69 min: [](//#ball) **GOAL! IT DOESN'T MATTER! LENNON SCORES!** What a stunning strike from Lennon! It's almost like a FUCK YOU to the commentator! The ball bobbles over to Lennon from Ade who takes a touch and volleys it home into the corner! WHAT A STRIKE AZZA! TAKE A FUCKING BOW!
* 74 min: Not enough for Timmy! Lamela is getting prepped to come on.
* 75 min: Change for Spurs. [](//#up) Lamela [](//#down) Lennon
* 75 min: And almost a goal for Lamela! Adebayor breaks and a touch finds Lamela but his toe-poke effort is bumbled wide.
* 76 min: Ade has been spending a little too much time with Defoe I think, or he's just madly hungry for a goal. Two times that Ade has asked for the ball at his feet when play was still decently executed.
* 77 min: **Lamela** taking on players and showing some skill today, lovely to watch. Let's hope he produces something for an icing on the cake.
* 79 min: Adebayor takes our 20th shot at goal today.

**Spurs have had 67% possession today, taken 20 shots at goal with 11 on target. Stunning stuff. This is how we should be at home - awesome stuff.**

* 80 min: Change for Spurs. [](//#up) Chadli [](//#down) Adebayor
* 82 min: SO CLOSE! Great play sees Soldado bumble a ball across goal but Lamela is just too late to reach it. So close... so close.

**Stat-attack. Spurs have had 20 shots, Stoke have had... 1.**

* 83 min: Make that second shot at goal. Pennant chips the ball into the box and Crouch climbs over Dawson but the effort is straight at Lloris.
* 84 min: Quality commentary. ""20 shots at goal and just 3 goals though. Poor."" LOL
* 85 min: Chadli fires in a left footed low cross, Soldado is a second late and it's cleared.
* 88 min: [](//#yellow) Lamela picks up a yellow for a late challenge. 
* 90 min: Four minutes of added time.
* 90+3 min: Dembele has been a boss today. Really. Does a roulette to get the ball away from a Stoke player.
**This has been our best performance in the Premier League this season. By far. FINAL WHISTLE. AND THREE POINTS FROM THREE GOALS!**

**[](//#notes) MATCH FACTS:**

* Luis Suárez has been wonderful this season, but did not score against Manchester United, Arsenal or Manchester City on Boxing Day.
* Chelsea have won only two of their last 13 Premier League matches with Liverpool (W2, D4, L7).
* The Blues have only lost one of their last eight league games.
* Jose Mourinho's side have now kept two clean sheets in a row in the league after only keeping one in their previous 11.
* Mourinho has won 54 and lost none of his 69 Premier League matches as a manager at Stamford Bridge.
* Our last league win against Liverpool was at Anfield (2-0) in May 2010 on our way to the Premier League title.
* Let's hope that like the majority of us Luis Suarez had enough to eat over Christmas - he was banned for 10 matches after biting Branislav Ivanovic in April.

**DAYS SINCE**

* Chelsea beat Liverpool in the Premier League: 1,337
* Arsenal won a trophy: 3,144
* Liverpool won the league: 8,639

Wanted to see if anyone shared this sentiment.  

I thought Season 7 was the worst season by far ever seen in the history of New Doctor Who and not only that, I thought it was total shit. 

I'd been a major fan straight from Eccleston and loved the writing, the climaxes, the mythos and was thoroughly impressed consistently in the 10th Doctor era. 

There was ALWAYS something I just really ENJOYED from the Matt Smith seasons (Bless the Time of the Angels) and although Tennant was my favourite, Matt Smith could genuinely play a good Doctor but at times I felt he was prone to overselling his character which I found in the big speech moments, most of which were incredibly cringeworthy. 

I've been stewing this disgust for a year but I can definitely go into specifics if need be when I'm bothered. 

To sum things up for now, it seemed the worst aspects of Matt Smith's Doctor came in full force in Season 7. 

Speeches were everywhere and they were Smith's weakness. A good speech every now and then established The Doctor's experience and wisdom and how against impossible odds, he better than anyone would know better to deal with the problem (offer alternatives, mercy, impart wisdom). Matt Smith cannot do this without giving you a butthole clenching cringe with his delivery but that's partly the writing's fault and worst offence of all, they were LITERALLY everywhere in Season 7 so you got SO used to big damn speeches, they had crap for impact. 

One of the very rare moments in Season 7 that I saw Matt Smith as a fully fledged Doctor was perhaps the first 5 min of The Time of the Doctor. Just his manner and the dialogue were perfect in those 5 min and reminded me of his previous seasons. The rest felt like oversold bullshit. 

What would be my second gripe with the season as a whole was just the writing and the things that made nearly every damn episode covered in shit. And I can't  even cover it in this post to do it justice: it was always something different in each episode that ruined the episode and plastered it with crap. The poorly written actor cameo of Brian, Rory's Dad, the laughable makeup in Crimson Horror, the horribly unwhelming climax to the boring Power Of Three... it just goes on. 

I literally thought Moffat had grown nuts and ran out of ideas. I waited every damn episode to make up for the crap but it NEVER came. The closest was Hide but I thought the ending was stuck on like hell. 

I'll probably review each episode but this is my pronz account. ",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Season 7 was absolute garbage (Spoilers),0,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1ty2pq/season_7_was_absolute_garbage_spoilers/

I'm 27, have paid into a pension for no more than 2 years, an average 5.9% contribution with 14% employer contributions. It's a rate of gain I don't think I can match anywhere else, and I'm a mug if I think otherwise.. What my grip is, the normal pensionable age is now 68 for me, I dare say it'll be 75 before I 'get there', drawing early has a penalty, drawing a lump sum has a tax implication.  

Is it worth it?  

It's a good deal, and it'll last me - But, I can't help but feel like I'll spend all this time spinning money off into a fund, only to have a year or two left in me by the time I come to draw it!  

What's the point? Has anyone else set up savings and privately put aside for their future, without a pension? I'm in two minds and can't decide either way at the minute, so have left myself in the fund.  

FirstDirect are offering 6% on a 1year savings account, it just about beats an ISA, and realistically I can put in 250/300 a month and have no ill thoughts about touching it.  

My plan would be to at least have the money sat saving for a year, in which time I'll read up on how best to start investing or moving it about - and by the time 12 months have passed I'll be a bit more knowledgeable and prepared.

I will be visiting a friend of mine in England for 10 days or so in March. I'll be staying with her in Preston so I won't have to pay for lodging. Plane ticket is around $1100 (US) and considering that's such a big chunk of change for me, I plan on having about 500 pounds to spend during my visit. If I run out of money, I have an additional $1000 (US) at my disposal, but I'd rather not touch that. Food and whatnot will be bought at a grocery store or something similar and prepared at her apartment. We don't each much and are both vegetarian so it'll be somewhat cheap, I imagine.

She's the kind of person who hates making decisions so she asked that I do some research on what I'd like to do. The problem is, London is huge and there is so much to do in that city and we won't be there for long. I have some ideas but would to get some advice from a native. Museums, outdoors type stuff, notable pubs, obscure sights or places that are noteworthy. I'm not very big on major tourist destinations. I like exploring the little nooks and crannies most tourists would never go to. Definitely would like some recommendations on pubs. I love a good beer. 

Anyways, we will be spending 3 days and 2 nights in London (Thursday through Saturday, I believe) and I really would like some ideas of what to do. Train tickets are going to be expensive, and she told me the place we will be staying will cost 100 pounds a night (we are splitting this, so 100 pounds each for 2 nights). Again, food will be made in the hotel. No eating out (unless there is some food you highly recommend).

The rest of the time will be in Preston and Manchester. Anything you think we should do? She knows this city pretty well, but is demanding I have something I'd like to do or see in mind. But again, I'm a bit overwhelmed.

* in 1993-1994 UK's unemployment was nearly 11%;
* since 2001 until 2008 UK's unemployment was at around 5%;
* Eastern Europe joined EU in 2004 but unemployment suddenly rose only after 4 years and exactly at the time world's economic crisis developed;
* UK's population raises basically every year [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom). Unemployment isn't really that connected to raising population number as otherwise such would be rising every year as well (it's to those claiming newcomers take jobs from locals);
* Between 2005-2009 1.5 mln immigrants from ""New EU"" came to UK but many came back and it is estimated that only 700k stayed in UK [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom_since_Irish_independence);
* University College London's report proved EU immigrants contributed to UK's economy and were less likely to claim benefits and live in social housing;
* There are at least 1.7mln Brits living abroad in Europe and although they may not be as work active as new EU arrivals in UK, they certainly use local health services (probably more often than those immigrants in UK), housing and even ""take jobs"" from locals;
* Just in 2006 154k British Citizenships were granted with largest groups from India, Pakistan, Somalia and Philippines;
* Half of the population increase between years 1991-2001 was due to foreign born immigrants (4.9 mln total);
* EU migrants do not come to UK for ""health tourism"" as most of the countries in EU have free healthcare and only in few of them healthcare is much worse than in UK;
* Immigration to UK has been higher from outside of EU than from within and although many are students it is well known fact that those ""students"" very often come here to  eventually settle or use studying as the main excuse to migrate to UK. Even when studying they are allowed to p/t work;
* EU nationals integrate better into UK society as it is much similar to their own. Most religions in Europe are based on Christianity and obviously this religion is way different and less far right when compared to some other religions;
* Non EU arrivals come from countries like China 1bln and India 1.3bln where living standards are many times lower than average standards in EU (or even in poorest EU countries). Given opportunity at least half of non-EU citizens living in third world would come to EU, USA or other rich places;

**Edit** More points, based on things mentioned by other redditors.

* [Healthcare in Europe is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the national level. The systems are primarily publicly funded through taxation (universal health care).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Europe) - source proving most EU countries have mostly free healthcare (even Bulgaria - 81.9% and Romania - 60% funded);
* EU immigrants have full rights to work in UK, meaning they are much less keen to work below NMW, which is the case in regard to illegal immigration and immigration from outside of EU. They also feel equal and even if currently do some jobs for less than others they will want an increase as this is called equality;
* ""Floods of immigrants"" - different sources give different numbers. The best is to use Census ([Census from 2011 showing 500k Poles living in UK](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/august-2011/polish-people-in-the-uk.html)). Poland is the largest country from EE (which then accessed) as they have 39mln citizens. I and [this source](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2013/jul/31/eastern-europeans-uk-numbers-benefits) estimate current total EE immigration at around 1.5% of total UK population;
* ""Stranding our services"" - yes, those immigrants have impact on services but there are BUTs. Total number of them is estimated tops at around 1.5%, which for the sake of argument I will increase to 2%. That means for every 100 British people there are 2 immigrants from EE. Obviously some parts have more, some less but according to this [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles_in_the_United_Kingdom) highest areas of them are max around 6%. STRANDING? With average 2 extra citizens (going to max 6) for 100 people? That is around one child school in a classroom of 25;
* ""Stranding our services"" again - even if new schools and hospitals need to be built, isn't it good? More people locally, means more paid taxes and council tax. New building means employment for building company and new staff, more taxes and nin paid. How can this be bad if government in order to boost economy supports projects like building stadiums for Olympics (plenty of them used mainly only for Olympic) or HS2 and other;
* PLEASE don't say that all Brits are awesome employers and employees. NOT one society is 100% ideal. Why dismiss reasoning that some Brits can't compete with immigrants because they are lazy (don't want to work at all, want to work for too much, decent life on benefits), not skilled enough (going back to lazy not wanting to increase their skills) or are cheaters (can't or don't want to do proper job, increase job prices). I bet plenty of Brits are great but anybody who doesn't mention there are many bad ones is either stupid or a politician who doesn't want to lose votes from such people;
* ""Immigrants lower wages"" - look point above. Obviously immigration has some impact on reducing wages but I'm pretty sure it is overestimated and if something is more connected with illegal immigration and immigration from outside of EU. Also, 1.5% population simply can't decrease all national wages and quite significantly as economy doesn't work like that and changes only when major movements are done.
* Employers should pay more"" - yes, many of them can and should pay more HOWEVER how many can't afford doing that? They exist because they employ people 10% cheaper and people who want to work and want to work hard. Do you want to bankrupt those companies? Isn't it better to have more companies (even if they employ immigrants for little bit less), which they pay taxes, nin and contribute by their work or goods to society or have it's owner on unemployment benefit?
* Immigrants from EE come from countries which are not THIRD WORLD, where people on daily basis sleep on streets throughout whole lives (like in India), can't meet basic needs like food, water, shelter and very often don't have any human and citizen rights. Those EE people are not desperate to come here and to do anything just to have some food. They may live here in a few in a flat but they have pretty similar lives like Brits (maybe less partying, less pub drinking, less expensive shopping). This is an argument towards type of migration they are and that they want to work legally, integrate and eventually even will go back home;
* Those immigrants who come to UK are normally after education and any skilled training. This means that a worker with a skill comes to UK to work but UK paid NOTHING and given no loans towards his education. Only few years ago UK's studies went to 9k (and I assume it is still not 100% funded by a student) where they used to be 1.3k and later 3k p/a;
* ""Migrants to Britain are not just coming from Eastern Europe, or from EU countries. The choice to focus on Eastern European migrants plays to common assumptions that aren't based on fact. In 2011, 168,000 long-term migrants arrived in the UK from the EU - but 329,000 arrived from outside of the EU. That's not a new trend - since 1975 non-EU migrants have far outnumbered EU migrants every single year"" [source](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2013/jul/31/eastern-europeans-uk-numbers-benefits) pretty much explains itself;
* Cameron and some previous Labour lot saying ""spectacular mistake letting EE in"" is just cruel. Don't they see they attack people personally by saying so? Even if it was a mistake in calculation Cameron should have some decency and use wording relevant, which would not hurt those immigrants, of whom many became British already. Something along lines ""Labour failed to predict numbers of immigration"", while Labour should say ""We made a mistake in calculation but facts have given proof that in those days immigration was necessary and we are glad that at the end it contributed economy. We couldn't predict there will be a world financial crisis"" and etc.

Extra point I wanted to make as once I read ""Britain doesn't owe anything to Eastern Europe"". More Brits should take proper history lessons and read more about recent events rather than something which happened hundreds or thousands of years ago. 
Any good observant will notice that after II WW, whole Eastern Europe was given to Stalin as a bribe to stop him and Communism into Western Europe. Germany was divided and it makes sense (they were the aggressor) but why at the same time give all countries from that part of Europe to Stalin so that he could pump goods and services from them towards keeping of his country? I know people were fed up with war and that it may have been the only good solution then but I think it would be nice if some appreciated that historical event, which basically stopped any progress in those countries for around 50 years!",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,"With all that ""Eastern Europeans taking our jobs"" why nobody actually looks at historical unemployment figures and other facts?",45,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1tya7u/with_all_that_eastern_europeans_taking_our_jobs/

In all of this you could argue Coutinho is being played out of position, but I think that doesn't hold much weight because the fluidity of our front and midfield. He is often in positions he likes. Whether its coming slightly deep or playing right off the striker.

That said, Coutinho has shown both terrible decision making and the inability to pick a pass without near ages of time. Yes, a few times a game he'll scuttle by defenders with some good footwork which can occasionally relieve pressure, but those rarely end in anything substantial.

Too often he takes selfish shots that he's shown absolutely no proof he can finish. We've proven with Suarez, Sterling, Sturridge, Hendo, Allen, and Coutinho that we can do the intricate play around the box superbly, even against sides like City and Chelsea. And yet right on the edge of the box he's whipping in shots that almost always hit the first man. I'm pulling my hair out.


Now maybe a lot of people will say I'm changing my tune after two losses, but I've been on Coutinho all season. But for a few flick ons early in the season, he's rarely made the sort of cutting passes he made last season. 

While I still have high hopes for the lad, I think its time for Rodgers to be okay signing someone else to start in that position for the rest of the season. Because Coutinho just isn't getting it done right now and perhaps some competition would do him good.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,We need to talk about Coutinho,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1tyanf/we_need_to_talk_about_coutinho/

I developed a theory after Eleven's regeneration that it depends on how long the current incarnation lived.  
Because let's recall Nine's regeneration: It was powerful, obviously, but fairly mild. Rose could stand next to him without even being blown off of her feet. **Nine's regeneration was mildly powerful.**  
Nine only lived for 'one season', but that doesn't say anything. It does however say something that Rose didn't really age too much from when she met him to his regeneration; **Nine's lifespan was short.**  
Now for Ten's regeneration: He blew up the TARDIS with it, I think that should say enough. **Ten's regeneration was very powerful.**  
Ten lived a ~~LONG~~ time. ~~He even said that he ""lived too long"" himself, on multiple occasions. Yes, he travelled with human companions and they didn't age too much either, but he also travelled alone - and according to his stories, did so for a long time. *EDIT: It is said in The Day Of The Doctor that between the time Ten married Queen Elizabeth I and Eleven's appearance in the episode, 400 years passed.*~~ He even cheated himself out of his 'first regeneration' by channeling the energy into his severed hand. **Ten's lifespan was ~~very~~ long.**  
And Eleven, well, he blew up a Dalek fleet with his regeneration. When it finally came to the actual regeneration, it was super quick - though that might be because he was holding back for Clara. **Eleven's regeneration was extremely powerful.**  
**Eleven literally died of old age.** He lived as long as an incarnation can live, which must be a few hundred years! I don't remember perfectly, but I thought it was said he'd lived in Christmas for three hundred years, wasn't it? *EDIT: Or, eight hundred, according to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1tvolj/the_doctors_stay_on_trenzalore/) theory.* Anyway, that, plus all the time he'd lived before. Granted, he travelled mostly with human companions, but again, there was a period where he travelled alone, and by the looks of it, underwent a huge development.  
So, what do you guys think?  
  
**EDIT:** Okay, so, nevermind what I said in the comments, Ten apparently didn't live *that* long. But still, about four to five times longer than Nine. So, if we assume it's gradual, Ten's regeneration would be about five times stronger than Nine's. Enough to blow up the TARDIS? Obviously, Eleven lived the longest, and thus his regeneration was the strongest. Again, he blew up a whole Dalek fleet with it.

In this season of merriment, I find myself needing to extall the virtues and highlight the dangers that every vehicle owner potentially faces. A little backstory.

I live in Pilton and own a Motorbike. Not having a private garage, I found myself with little option, but to keep it hidden as best I could and give it the best level of protection I can afford. Last night, a neighbour knocked on my door, telling me that she had just seen a gang of ""youths"" trying to steal my bike. Infuriated, I grabbed the nearest metal object and running to where I keep my bike. Nobody was there. This, at first, gave me hope, as it seems that my security was enough to stop the little cunts from stealing what is probably their 100th bike, just to ride it, dump it and torch it. But when the police arrived to take information, the advice and information they gave me was sickening.

They told me that after a ""recon"" of a potential bike, the likelihood of them returning was somewhere in the region of 80-90%. My bike is anchored with 16mm chrome-plated steel chain and a screamer disk lock. Whilst they did complaiment my security, they warned that bike thieves that operate in the area have been known to break through tougher security than this. Whilst I had my suspicions, they basically confirmed what I had suspected; That many of the thieves are under the age of 16, and so police power is deminished. They are well aware of the identities of many ""suspected"" bike thieves, but can do little to actually stop it. Sickening as it is, the most appropriate measure of response which I would apply to criminals would likely land me in more troube than the walking abominations that consider themselves ""Untouchable"".

All the police could do for me is give me an incident number and advise me to be vigilant. I only got to sleep at 7:00am this morning. Likely, I will be up all night again, keeping a vigil over my most prized posession. 

So that's me. Sooner or later, I will wake up with police in my living room, telling me to contact my insurance. The most dreaded fear of many a cyclist, biker or car owner, not just in Edinburgh, but the world over.

I don't mean to rant, but throw a stone in this city and you will hit someone who has been affected by car or bike theft or vandalism. The thieves are getting bolder and the problem is growing, and will continue to do so, until we get some of these bastards behind bars. All I can ask is for everyone to do their part to eliminate this prevelant threat that overshadows everyone who desires to live without fear that their property might be violated.

Thanks guys. May we all live in a safer world tomorrow...",false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,null,null,self,A caution to Motorbike owners living in less reputable ares in edinburgh...,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/1tyfet/a_caution_to_motorbike_owners_living_in_less/

For more information or to see past discussion, you can check out my posts [from the 10th](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1sjd9q/inspired_by_the_post_our_pl_campaign_thus_far/) and [from the 17th](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1t1rfg/comparing_this_seasons_matches_vs_the/).

**Concept**

Most comparisons between last season and this season will show the results after 19 matches played.  While this can contrast when a team gets hot and cold from one year to the next, I don't like that comparison.  Instead, I compiled the results of all the games from this season and compared them side-by-side to the results of the same matches from last season.

**The Table**

Instead of trying to construct a table right in the text box, I have upgraded to Google Docs.  Now the viewer has the option to sort chronologically by either season, by opponent, by home/away, or by W/L/D.  The table can be found [**here.**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgCq30JgWU_kdE5TUDlfMUNWalc0VXVndGZGZHExUHc&amp;usp=sharing)

*I still haven't figured out how to use formulas so I can't get the table to figure out goal differential and point totals.  If anyone can do that, let me know how I can integrate that.*

**Notes**

* Scores are listed Tottenham-Opponent rather than Home-Away because it makes it easier to add together.

* To account for relegation and promotion, results from last year's 17th place PL team is compared against results from last year's 1st place Championship team.  Wigan Athletic ≈ Cardiff City, Reading ≈ Hull City, and QPR ≈ Crystal Palace.

**Bottom Line**

Tottenham 2013/14:

     10 wins, 4 draws, 5 losses; 22 goals for, 24 goals against, GD of -2; 34 points

Tottenham 2012/13:

     9 wins, 6 draws, 4 losses; 33 goals for, 24 goals against, GD of +9; 33 points

* * * * *

**Edit:** Only after submitting I decided to total up home and away form compared between seasons.

2013/14 Home:

     4 wins, 3 draws, 3 losses; 11 goals for, 13 goals against, GD of -2; 15 points

2012/13 Home:

I ordered a pair of trainers from there yesterday, from my phone, when I was out shopping for a new pair of trainers. Their site seemed pretty legitimate so I just went ahead and placed my order.
However, now, looking at it from my PC and going through my emails things look a little dodgy.
- They sent me a confirmation email without my 'product details' or 'product number'.
- Their 'new releases' section, and all of their products are all added on the same day (July 18th 2013).
- They use 'SSL Credit Pay' as their secure payment method - I can't find anything about those.
- They have no form of contact other than an email address: service3@mailfor2013.com
- Terrible grammar and spelling throughout their site.

I chose the 'checkout without creating account' option as I was on the move and this was the quicker option. The money was taken out of my account shortly after I placed the order (using a debit card as they didn't accept paypal) and I have no idea of how to go about getting a refund or whether they are a reliable site, in which case I will wait until my trainers arrive.

I tried sending an email to the email address they provided but it's the weekend so I won't receive a reply until tomorrow, if ever.

When I turned 18 this June I started saving up for a trip to London and was finally able to get enough for me and my younger brother (who is also an avid fan) to visit London on Christmas. During the days leading up to Christmas, I faced some very disturbing personal problems as well as some academical hiccups at university, in addition to also breaking up with my girlfriend. Everything was going downhill 


I booked two tickets. One for the Swansea game in the Matthew Harding lower, and the Liverpool one on the first row of the West end. 

The Swansea game, although in itself was quite boring, was amazing. Although I had a restricted view, I was able to clearly enjoy the whole game. The atmosphere was simply amazing. I loved every minute of the chanting and the singing, and was able to get a carefree chant going as well, something I'm proud of.

Today's Liverpool game did not have the amazing atmosphere of the MH, but it was a first row experience that allowed me to witness the magic of the blues up close. I was sitting next to a handicapped senior blue who chanted and sang from his heart and encouraged me to join in. I must say it was amazing.

What I'm trying to conclude with is that Chelsea made me forget everything and enjoy my holidays. It was an amazing experience and I encourage anyone who never went to a Chelsea game to book the next ticket.

Give the kid a break. It was his first match for LFC. Against Chelsea. At the Bridge. With Mourinho at the helm. 

2. He's 19. He's not exactly Philip Lahm or Ashley Cole coming off the bench. Stop criticizing him.

3. What are you criticizing him for anyway? He ran his heart out, wrestled every opposing player whenever he could, made some good runs and passes forward and didn't give up any goals or key passes.

Now, regarding Brendan's decision: we were being absolutely demolished on the wings. Agger was constantly being outpaced by Willian, Hazard, Dave, Oscar and Eto'o. Alberto is NOT a pacey player by any means. 

He's got great ball control and vision, but he was never going to do a better job than Brad at solving our main problem - STOPPING THE OPPOSITION BREAKING DOWN THE FLANK. Smith is like Kelly - he runs box to box, presses, marks tight AND he's fast. 

Also, we already had Lucas, Henderson and Allen in central midfield along with Suarez who was forced to drop back. Bringing on Alberto would have meant crowding the center of the park leaving one wing completely wide open.

Rodgers understood that in order to give Suarez some room to move, we needed more of a threat down the wings to pull Terry and Cahill further apart, which would also allow our central midfielders to make passes in the final third. 

If anything, Alberto should have later come on for Henderson who was clearly having a tough time getting the ball off his feet before Chelsea's midfield were absolutely clambering him.

As soon as Brad came on, Agger was able to get further forward, our left flank was better protected and we started to make se good runs forward - something Agger was failing to so the entire match while out wide.

If we had Enrique today, we probably wouldn't have conceded either of the goals they scored, and made many more attacks forward. If Sturridge was back, we could have pulled Terry and Cahill deeper into their own end giving Suarez more than half a yard on the ball between defense and midfield.

Chelsea are bringing players like Cole, Mata, Mikel and Eto'o off their bench - that's what cost us the win (Webb cost is the draw). Not Rodgers choosing to use appropriate tactics or Brad Smith not being Van Bronchorst.

Not interested in the sometimes cheesy SFX of the 60s-80s? How about a fan of Classic Who with a questionable recollection of the arcs or only access to Netflix's spotty Classic collection? Here's an experiment. 

1) Pick a Classic Doctor.

2) Search YouTube for a best of or tribute to that Doctor to get a feel for their mannerisms and acting style.

3) Check Tor.com for their series of ""Classic Doctor Who: X Doctor's Essential Episodes"" articles. Where X is the [First](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/09/classic-doctor-who-the-first-doctors-essential-episodes), [Second](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/09/classic-doctor-who-the-second-doctors-essential-episodes), [Third](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/09/classic-doctor-who-the-third-doctors-essential-episodes), [Fourth](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/10/classic-doctor-who-the-fourth-doctors-essential-episodes), etc.

4) Find a [Target Novelization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_novelisations) for that story. They're fairly cheap on Amazon and Ebay.

5) Read it.

This shouldn't be too hard as there are only five arcs that weren't novelized. 

If you've already seen some Classic Who, pick a few arcs you haven't already seen and read it. The only real hurdle is finding a Classic arc you haven't seen, especially if you're a long time fan. Before you watch--or re-watch--the episode, read the novel. Take your time, actually read the thing, don't tear through it in an hour. Then, watch the episode. It's the same story. The description sometimes doesn't quite catch the acting or sets, but the novel will be far better than the episodes. Why? Because the SFX in your head will be infinitely better than anything they could imagine back in the day. I have done this experiment myself recently. It was eye-opening.

Let's look at the reasons:

* We play everyone except United at home. All the really tough away fixtures are done. We can expect a significant haul from those home games, compared to our (really quite good) away form
* The January window is opening. From past windows under Rodgers, it appears targets are already identified and business is being processed. These past two defeats give extra impetus to the owners to invest now, when prices will be lower than the summer, when Liverpool's stock will likely have further risen.
* Sturridge, Gerrard, Enrique, and Flanagan will be back within a few weeks. And we have a cup break in January, which eases the pressure further
* The major competitors for the league *fear* Liverpool now. Mourinho's observation is 100% correct: they all have European dates to deal with, and that intensity will only increase as the winter months move to spring. If Liverpool can expand its squad in January, and keep players fit, we have a significant advantage in terms of lower playing time compared to our competitors.
* The team is likely to improve even more during the second half of the season, and Anfield can become a fortress once again.

The problem is that I don't have a social worker and my Citizens Advice office is shut until Jan 3rd. Third option is to make an appointment with GP but that will likely take days if I phone them in the morning. Last option is to get a voucher from the Job Centre but these are offered to those who have seen their benefits/crisis loan delayed (I am technically not ""unemployed""/don't claim benefits since I am a student). 

I'll give them a call first thing but if there is anyone out there with experience of the service, do you think they would give me food to see me by without having a voucher?

Not sure if I am posting in the right place, I am looking for anyway to earn money from home or short term loan I could get.

Sorry to give a bit of a background, I am currently having to look after my wife 24/7 due to her suffering from severe depression, she hears voices and lacks control over herself with certain voices, where she will do things like poor boiling water over herself etc etc, you don't really need the gory details.

Anyway we lost our home and have been staying in a caravan and are going to be homeless come the 7th of Jan, we may be given a hostel placement but we cannot take our dog who losing will just push my partner further. 

Getting a private rent is hard as hell when your credit rating has gone to hell. So I managed to find somewhere that would let us have a 1 bedroom flat so I've sold just about everything to fund it but I am currently running £400ish short.

I've tried payday loans etc but they cannot do it as I only have a bank card not a debit card. 

So has anyone got any ideas how I can raise £400 quickly please? Loans would be fine as when her benefits are sorted they will be backdated to August (yea that's how long we have been waiting)

Mourinho started a team made for the way we played today. Liverpool get way too much time on the ball which is why their attack is so lethal, we gave them none of that and when they did dominate possession, it was on sterile ground. From the very start you could see Liverpool weren't ready for the pressure we put on them and, for me, that's pure genius from Jose.

For the last few weeks he's been copping some stick from our own fans calling his style of play boring and anti-climatic when we enter the final 3rd. This game was just a great game to watch as a Chelsea fan. Couldn't be happier with how it played out. Although Ramires would have probably been chosen over Lampard if he was eligible, he would have brought that added intensity earlier in the game. But Frank put his heart into playing as high tempo as the rest of the team and for that he deserves props.

Another honourable mention would be the amount of times Luiz tracked back from his usual attacking minded play. He defended beautifully and without him, we wouldn't have won the game. Some crucial tackles to shut down the play and Mourinho couldn't have been happier with him.

Do you guys remember how a drawn out and labored result against Notts county that saw every Liverpool supporter questioning our squad depth prior to the close of the window? Sturridge and Gerrard went on playing nearly an hour and a half less than a week prior to the Man U game. I don't know about you guys but I was livid to see them out there, in addition, I think Kolo did his groin that game too.

Within days we saw Sakho, Ilori, and Moses (if I recall correctly) leaning  on things at Melwood and watching us take on the Champions and seal a 1-0 victory sans Suarez and Kolo. I thought the signings galvanized the squad with a sense of urgency and purpose to begin our season. 

I find myself in a similar situation after the last 4 matches. The emphatic win away against Spurs. The momentum boosting home win against Cardiff. The win/draw that never was against City; a hard fought match. The frustrating loss at the Bridge. 6 points out of the last 12 leading into the New Year. Aside from a slip up at Hull and a lack-luster result to Southampton, we're beating the teams we're supposed to beat and losing to the teams we ought to lose to.

If I'm holding the keys to our future there's no more important time than this transfer window, this year, with this team's mentality, to try my best to lay my mark on the outcome of the season.

I can't help but imagine that our owners know the importance of not letting the first half of our season die in vain. Given all of the factors that are at hand:

* Table position
* Injured starters
* Champions league affects on squad growth and key player retention
* Opportunities in the 2nd half of the season
* etc...

...our hand has to have been forced to give Brendan the added depth he *deserves* to help us kick on and prevent us from losing ground in the second half of the season.

tl;dr - This January is huge for us given injuries and how well we've done to date. We're not world beaters, but we're contenders for our top 4 spot.

**Winners**

**Mousa Dembélé**

Fantastic return from injury, looked as dangerous as ever and finally clicked well playing alongside Paulinho. Started off steady in the first half before really taking control during the second. Got a well deserved goal to cap off a stellar performance. Here's to hoping he takes more shots on the end of those driving runs.

**Paulinho**

After serving a 3 game ban for a red card, Paulinho looked to be back to his best. I've been saying for weeks that he needs to spend some time on the bench, for his own sake. This is what Paulinho does, he just comes back *better*. Looked like he was playing FIFA Street out there, lots of flair without getting carried away. If he can learn how to not sky the ball on every shot, we'll be in for some great football from him. Hopefully the injury's not serious.

**Aaron Lennon**

Put in a solid shift coming back from injury, looked dangerous, and finally scored again. A winger of his caliber *should* score more often than he does, and hopefully we'll see more of that now that Soldado and Adebayor are more involved up front in holdup play. EDIT: I list him as a winner because he had a good first game back from injury, didn't look rusty and scored. Sure he didn't score a hat trick, but it's a great match for him.

*(Honorable Mention)* **Kyle Naughton**. The guy gets a ton of flack for his poor form at LB, but showed today why he's a great backup RB. Looked confident on the ball and linked up well with Lennon. Probably could start at RB at a few lower table clubs IMO.

**Losers**

**Roberto Soldado**

He's a top class striker, and this game marked probably the 4th and 5th sitters he's missed in the past week. A striker of his skill should not be missing these, and while we didn't need them today, it could cost us in future games. Maybe it's a confidence issue, maybe just bad luck, but whatever it is needs to be addressed soon. At Valencia he excelled at scoring off crosses, and right now he's looking like Torres.",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,Spurs Winners and Losers: Stoke,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1tzidj/spurs_winners_and_losers_stoke/

I know he hasn't been too good in the games he's been given but we need to give him more time than he's had so far!

Also I think we have to take Johnson off for a few games, I think he's been our worst player this season by far and without any competition he's just getting worse. He's not even doing well going up front, and as a defender leaves a big gap when we lose the ball for any team to exploit. Maybe give Wisdom another chance, or Kelly, or whoever we can find because Glen just hasn't been good enough so far this year.

She listens to the doctor when it actually counts without going ""Right, well, he gave me very severe advice to not do this, so I'm going to ignore it, aren't I funny?"", but still isn't simply obedient, which is far more annoying. I find her funny, supportive, caring, and while she may have fallen in love with the doctor a bit, she's neither tricking herself into thinking that will go any further than its current state or making it the only character trait she has. It's just a thing that might happen when you spend so much time with such an extraordinary person as the doctor.

I can't help but notice that every time he has looked directly at the camera, it has been some kind of nod to the viewer, like breaking the fourth wall. In the 50th, after meeting the curator, [he looks right at the camera and nods](http://i.imgur.com/bcvOzC8.png), either a nod to the question ""Who knows?"", or [50th Anniversary Spoiler](#s ""to Tom Baker being in the episode"").  In his final speech, [he looks right at the camera](http://i.imgur.com/rMKuikV.png) when he says ""I will always remember when the Doctor was me.""

So I'm wondering if the originally mentioned ""nod"" was referring to his regeneration or something else. I mean, a good number of us already knew he was regenerating in this episode, so surely he wasn't referring to that. And it was clearly a deliberate move looking at the camera because they don't just let that happen.

The plot in many standalone episodes are great, and really engaging through the use of series canon to provide logical solutions to the Doctor's adventures. When the end of a season hits, its like watching a bunch of monkeys staple together an ending that barely connects to the other episodes in a way that makes sense.

This effect seems to be especially prevalent with the last two doctors more than any before.

Like many a younger fan, I started with nine, Christopher Eccleston. After spending a lot of time on this thread, I decided I was ready to take it to the next level. I would watch *all* the previous episodes, starting with William Hartnell. It was truly a different era of television.... slower, more drawn out, and basically extremely time consuming to watch. Definitely entertaining but just a whole different sausage. I realized that i'd vastly underestimated the scope of what I already thought was going to be quite a feat. So I turn to you, fellow fans, for advice.

What are the absolute must-watch episodes from each iteration of The Doctor? If someone wants to become familiar with and have a taste for each of the previous versions of the Doctor, what can't we miss?

Nineteen rounds down, nineteen to go. The Mighty Blues are fourth in the league and going into the new year above that other lot, but let's focus on what really matters - imaginary football.

The top three shuffle among themselves again, with **Spoon FC** pulling three points clear of **swagswag** in second. **Slumdog Mignolet** remain in third place, the only team to have been in the league since the first week without ever dropping out of the top ten. Or even the top four. Tangentially interesting, no new team has broken in to the top six of the league [in the last six rounds](http://i.imgur.com/uY2XGcI.png). 

**FC basherlona** have broken into the top ten to reach their best position yet, and both **Dirac FC** (19th) and **The Nether Lads** (22nd) have once again reached new heights. No other team achieved the same thing, although **Cech Yourself** have finally matched the 7th place they set for themselves all the way back in round 1. They dropped as low as 36th by round 9 but have gradually worked their way back up the table.


####Biggest movers:
The return of **Joey Barton's Visa** to the top ten was the biggest positive move of the round, rising five places from 13th. **Birkenhead** had the worst time, dropping six places. Just like the last round, there's not a lot else going on.

The code for the league is **375561-306516**, and if you fancy looking at your team's past positions, I keep track of them in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak5ieGUOod7fdDJaV0RmYzB2YVBiZk96VGxDMlQtN3c#gid=0).

Team: Leeds United

League Position: 7th

Star Man: Ross McCormack, with 18 league goals he has been our stand out player.

Most Improved: Jason Pearce, he has really settled this season after a dodgy first year with us. He plays with a lot more authority in McDermott's 5-3-2 formation and has even managed to chip in with a few goals as well.

Best Youngster: Alex Mowatt. He has come through the academy and looks comfortable in the championship considering he is only 18. His set piece delivery is very good and he has a good engine. Definite future Premier League player.

Most Disappointing: Noel Hunt. Played most of the games of the start of the season and played okay but couldn't buy a goal and is now fourth in the pecking order behind McCormack, Smith and Poleon.

Best Game: Charlton away. Winning 4-2 with McCormack getting all four is the clear highlight, especially considering our underwhelming away form.

Best Goal: McCormack's free kick against Charlton was top class. Luke Murphy's 92nd minute winner was very enjoyable as well.

Worst Game: 2-0 away to Millwall. Lack of quality and lowest point of the season

How's the manager doing: Very well with his limited resources. Did reasonably well in the transfer market buying younger players like Wooton and Murphy. He is building a strong side with a young British core which is nice.

What player do you want in January: Gradel would be nice, not only because he is a fan's favorite, he would bring pace and width to a team that plays a great deal of football in the middle of the park. A real match winner at Championship level.

Where will you finish: With signings we can are capable of getting a top 6 finish but if we do not buy wisely in January we could see another season slip by. Again.

And to be honest it's something that I'm sick of hearing about so I needed to post why I don't believe Moffat is sexist.


Like all writers, Moffat explores themes. The big themes he decided to explore were the Doctor Lies and Manipulates, and the consequences of the Doctor's actions. Basically every complaint of a sexist incident comes back to Moffat exploring these themes in the basic structure of the show - Male doctor, female companion. 

""After all, you can't kill an idea, can you? Not once it's made a home""

The same thing can be done to Russel T Davis era. For the record, I loved RTDs era, think he's written excellent female characters and I don't think he's sexist at all, but by slightly manipulating one of his main themes (The doctor turns ordinary people into extraordinary people) to the ""Male Doctor, female companion"" view the show is set in. And we get...


""Women can only achieve greatness when it's given to them by a man""


Rose is an ordinary girl, doing nothing with her life. She then meets a man and is able to save worlds. The man then becomes sick (The Christmas invasion) and Rose becomes useless, until the man gets better.

Martha is another ordinary girl who when she meets a man runs at the sign of danger. She finally achieves her potential when she does exactly what the man says (Going around telling everyone a story of him).

Donna is another ordinary girl, after meeting the man, he makes her into the most important person in the universe. When he leaves her all that is taken away from her, ""She was better with you"" Her grandfather tells the man.

I've just bought an hour's access for £4 as a trial, and I'm quite impressed with the speed. Before I throw 40 quid at BT, is there anything I should consider?

I'd like to plan an away day in April/May. All the big games have been played and far trips are out of my budget (I am a student and come from Belgium, a match costs me around €125 for ticket and transport). 

My best experience before the game was probably Fulham Away last year; friendly environment, nice pub and some good food..

Worst time I had before the game was probably West Ham this year. There's just nothing to do there. I arrived three hours before kick-off, it was fucking cold and I couldn't go to a bar.

Which of the following away trips is open to away fans (i.e. pubs for away fans, something to do around the stadium; something similar to Fulham) ?

* Cardiff

* Swansea City

I first watched football (or ""soccer"", since it was the more popular term where I come from) on the television around the 1999-2000 season. Beckham was still at United, City were non-entities, Arsenal were United's main rivals and Chelsea was just a rising star. I watched a few games here and there, picking up some names like the inescapable Beckham, Henry, some guy whose name sounded like Cola. I didn't really support any team back then and I only watched replays on Saturday afternoons. After a while, I lost interest in the game and thought it was boring and switched to watching the X-Games and other shows. I was in elementary that time. 


A few years later, I was in high school and I chanced upon a Premier League highlights kind of show and they showed this goal that would change the way I looked at football. There was this big African, ramming his way past a bunch of faceless shirt then struck the ball with vicious force into the back of the net. It was jaw-dropping. I remember hearing, ""Didier Drogba, strike artist"" and that got me back into watching the game. Add to that the fact that my Scottish uncle hated every English team except for Chelsea, because they shared a history with Rangers and I drifted to towards the Blues so naturally. And boy it's been one hell of a ride. Missing the Champions League by a slip and winning it when Chelsea was written out months before. Firing Managers, replacing them mid-season and then having it all over again. Getting flak and hellfire from mooks with nothing else to do. Yup, all in a day's work for the average Blues fan. 

But I'm rambling anyway so here's my list of things I'm thankful for in 2013...

-Winning the Europa League with Rafa at the helm. I mean, who the hell expected him to be in charge in the first place? And the jarring start to his reign, I was almost sure we'd be trophyless last season and people would be sending him death threats. But all's well that ends well I suppose.

-Getting Mourinho as manager. I know, Roman chased after Pep as well, but Mou's history with Chelsea is simply this. Mou might have made Chelsea into champions from contenders but his time at Chelsea fully established Mourinho as one of the world's best.

-Not spending so much in the summer transfer window. Our signing have been incredibly prudent thus far, compared to many of our former transfer windows.

-Being firmly in the running for the title halfway into the season. I mean come on, when was the last time the top 3 teams were just within a 2-point gap at the new year?

-Our loanees have actual potential now of making into the first team. Need I say more? 

-Squad depth is amazing. In terms of skill level, we can probably rotate most of the starting 11 every game and not see an appreciable drop. It's also possible to change the playing style using different player set-ups without risking too much.

-Roman seems happy to stick with Jose thus far.

-We are confirmed to see Drogba again, although not in Chelsea colors.

-Shout-out to Oscar. Thought that he'd be a squad-player at first, how sweet is it to be wrong.

-Hazard. His name is just literal.

a) Work out if/when I can ask for a pay rise

I'm currently in a situation where I'm financially stable, but could do with more cash generally as long term it's unlikely to really change dramatically. I can afford at best £100 a month in terms of spare cash, and while I understand this isn't much, I was wondering if there was anything I could do with this rather than just sticking it in a bank account?

Due to the size of my company I don't think we have to change to the auto enrolment until April 2017, and knowing my boss he won't do it before he has to, also I suspect he will only contribute the minimum employer contributions.   


What is my best option here? I am semi illiterate when it comes to pension but am doing my best to educate myself. I see it that I have 3 options;  



1) Subscribe to my companies Stakeholder pension scheme.

2) Start my own Private Pension Scheme.

3) Do nothing until 2017 when my employer is forced onto the auto enrolment scheme.  


I assume option 3 is the worst here so what is the pros and cons between options 1 and 2? Bearing in mind for both it will only be my contributions being paid in.

In the four weeks since, we’ve played 3 of last season’s top 5 away from home, all of whom spent big money in the summer.

Although not all of the results were great, we’re now just 6 points off the top. Only 1 behind Everton, still 2 ahead of United, and 2 ahead of Spurs. Despite having the hardest run of games of the top teams by far.

I'm a 22 year old woman. Recently moved back home to Southport after finishing uni. Currently a freelance designer working on bits here and there and gaining some experience as I hope to find work in a studio in the near future! 

Hobby wise, I enjoy cooking. Love to draw and nearly anything to do with illustration/design. Love video games, don't get much time to play them these days, and none of my mates play them! Will try anything once. Currently teaching myself HTML and CSS again as I am a little rusty. 

Could be a long shot, but figured it was worth a try and see if there was anyone out there that would be interested in hanging out or any suggestions for something new/interesting to do?

Here is to hoping we have a bright start :)

Just like my last three posts  . I have created one for GW 20. 

Matches considered with team who are +/- 3 points from us. Those are :-

* **Everton**
* **United**
* **Spurs**
* **Newcastle** 

The games being considered for this are :- 

* **WBA v/s  Newcastle**
* **Stoke v/s everton**
* **Liverpool v/s Hull**
* **United v/s Spurs**

Here is the final doc ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AnbRX76-rFRIdDBnRmlnTC04cG1ELVQtVGt0a2FpSWc&amp;output=html ) 

Some key points

* 4th is the best position we can have after this round, 6th is the worst ( 7th mathematically but Newcastle can never catch our goal difference ) 
* 45% chance that we will be jumping up to 4th 
* 48% chance that we will stay at 5th

For people seeing this for first time. Small guide to the spreadsheet 

* Home means home teams wins
* Draw is a draw
* Away means away team wins


***FAQ' s***


*  **Why are Arsenal/Chelsea/City not considered ?** They have more than 3 points of difference, their result wont affect our position 
*  **Where did you pick the odds for each match ?** bet365 
*  **Hey I have an idea, how can I contribute ?** Send me a pm

First off, I'm only talking about saving cash (for now); not stocks/shares.

I currently have an ISA which has ~£5,700 in it. It's coming up on 12 months since I opened it, so the interest rate will soon drop. Obviously I want to move this to a new ISA with a better rate.

My question is: 

If I transfer the ~£5,700 balance to a new ISA, I understand that this does not affect my tax benefits (provided I don't transfer it myself). Would I then still be able to pay in another £5,760 into this new ISA?

I recently moved from Guernsey Channel Islands, to Portishead in Bristol. I'm back in Guernsey for the christmas holidays, and am going back to Portishead on 10th January. I am bringing with me my 2 pet rabbits and 2 guinea pigs. This means I have no other option but to travel via boat to Weymouth.
I do not drive. My partner also does not drive, and we are finding it difficult to find friends of his that are available at the right time for a potentially 4 hour window to collect us from Weymouth Harbour.


I really do not want to get a train, as there are no train stations in Portishead I'd have to go to Bristol centre and then get a bus, and it just makes the journey so much longer for my animals, who are already going to be stressed. I figured there must be some kinda taxi service I can use? I understand taxi services tend to operated in a certain more restricted coverage area, and I'm asking for a very large coverage area, but surely there are long haul taxi services for things like this?


I did google, but I am apprehensive about using a random company off the internet without knowing if the source is reputable.

As the eleventh doctor explained in the Christmas special, the War Doctor counts towards this number, and the regeneration at the beginning of *Journey's End* where the 10th Doctor kept his face but still prevented death counted towards that number as well.  This means that for the Valeyard to be between the 12th and 13th incarnations, he must be somewhere in between the beginning of *Journey's End*, and the end of *End of Time*.  There actually was another Doctor created during this period, the ""Metacrisis"" Doctor who was notably more warlike than the real one, was unable to regenerate himself since he only had one heart and  eventually went of with Rose to the parallel universe.  

That duplicate Doctor, then, could be the Valeyard.  He's between the twelfth and thirteenth incarnations, he has questionable morality and he can't regenerate.  Entirely natural then, for him to decide to take half of the real Doctor's original regenerations by putting the Sixth Doctor on trial.  Sure, he'd have to not only find a way back to the normal universe but also go back in time on Gallifrey itself, but I'm sure something could be worked out.

According to the article we could soon be expecting Sturridge and Gerrard to return to the fold, which is great considering our current depth issues. And the initial reports of Allen out for 6 weeks and Sakho for 2 months looks to have been way off the mark. 2 weeks for Allen and only 6 for big ole Mamadou seems more likely. 

The next three prem fixtures are all ones that we should be expecting three points from (hull, villa, and stoke) regardless of a thin squad. Looks like we are still on track to challenge for a top 3-4 finish.

These stats all come from Squawka (and the formatting wasn't uniform so sorry if things don't line up great).  

I am trying to compare him to the other Defensive Midfielders in the league.  

Let's start [with passing](http://i.imgur.com/iASuajJ.png).  

4th in minutes played, 4th in games played, 1st in passes completed, 2nd in pass percentage (only 1% behind Flamini).  He could use some work on his ""Key passes"" but he's middle of the pack.  


Next, let's [look at Duels](http://i.imgur.com/EqImUGE.png).  (ignore ""Take Ons, that is an offensive stat).  

Only Claudio Yacob has more Successful Tackles than Lucas and Ramires is tied.  For percentages, Lucas is 4th it ""tackles won"".  In terms of headed duels, Lucas has a whopping 38 won.  The next closes is Fernandinho at 28.  

Next we'll look at [Defensive Actions](http://i.imgur.com/eax2VR2.png).  

Lucas has the most Interceptions, is middle of the pack for Blocks and has 7 more Clearances than the next guy.  Total ""Defensive Actions"" is at 103, with 2nd place being 23 behind.  


If you look at just the Ratings given by Squawka, Lucas tops the list each time (except for ""Duels Won"" but Ramires gets a boost for ""Take Ons"").  For a purely Defensive midfielder, he is probably the best in the league.  Even if he's not the best in the league, there really is no reason to talk poorly about him or be disappointed with his performances.

We ended up with a 5-0 rout, a solid but admittingly nervous 3-1 win, and a pair of frustrating but optimistic 2-1 losses against top 4 rivals. 




We achieved that goal, and the feeling around this sub isn't has bright as it should be. You can't honestly tell me at the beginning of the season you wouldn't have given anything to see where Liverpool are currently. So let's keep one thing in mind, top four is the primary goal, and Liverpool are doing quite well towards that. 




But the next 5 games are all, considerably, winnable games. Hull (H), Stoke (A), Aston Villa (H), Everton (H), West Brom (A).

I've come to the point where my home town no longer holds the same appeal and having visited Brighton in the last year it's the only place I've visited that has really struck me as somewhere I'd like to live. All in all I'm looking for help or advice getting a reasonable job and a a relatively inexpensive place to live.


My history with employment has mostly been based in hospitality (restaurants, bars, hotels, nightclubs) but ideally I would be looking to work in an office environment as my most recent job has been in car finance and working with finances etc really does hold appeal for me. Any suggestions as far as good employers to look at in the area would be really appreciated.

As far as a place to live the budget depends on what work I can get but all I really want is a double room with space for a computer desk. Other than that I'm surprisingly easy to please. Parking would be preferable but I know it's not practical so something within cycling distance of the city would be fine.

All in all, sorry for talking so much but I just adore Brighton and would love to settle down there and make a new life for myself. Hopefully making friends with a few of you on the way.

The Doctor looks like this:

http://i.imgur.com/jKHUAGj.jpg

However, then the Doctor sends Clara back home once again. This time, when Clara returns, the Doctor had spent another period of time on Trenzalore. We don't know how long that time period was, but we know it aged him *significantly* compared to last time:

http://i.imgur.com/Z7BZUit.png

To me, it seems like he spent around 1000 years on Trenzalore, if not more.

--------------------

Another issue I keep seeing posted is why didn't the 11th Doctor age before. I would disagree about that. I think he has aged. Look at him in the eleventh hour, and then look at him in Time of the Doctor. To me, there is a significant difference. In appearance as well as personality.

If we are to say the 11th Doctor looked like a human in their early 20s at the beginning of his life, I would say he could have easily aged to his mid 30s by Time of the Doctor, and that would be approximately 300 years of aging, since the 11th Doctor started out at ~900 years old, and was ~1200 in Time. 

If we apply that same amount of aging to the Doctor's first period of time on Trenzalore, then he should have looked around his late 40s / early 50s, and I think that fits. He has some wrinkles, and a few grey hairs, but still has some energy and doesn't look like he's aged very much. 

If we add another 700 years (to total 1000 years on trenzalore) he should appear to be in his mid 80s, which seems believable to me as well.

It is far-fetched but could it be that this solution to the time war was the trigger for the first doctor to become renegade, stealing a TARDIS and running away from Gallifrey the whole time?

I mean all the ""old"" doctors obviously forgot that they saved Gallifrey from the timewar, but maybe Moffat plans to explain it like a subconscious thing...a instinct. 

Maybe ALL his lives he tried to run away from this day.

""A"" team: Players who featured against Stoke (including reserves Chadli/Lamela/Capoue):  
 

Naughton--Dawson--Chiriches---Fryers  
Lennon--Dembele--Paulinho--Eriksen--(Lamela/Capoue/Chadli)  
---------Soldado--Adebayor  

""B"" team: Players who did not feature (injured/unused subs):  


Walker--Vert---Kaboul--Rose  
-----Sandro--Benteleb  
Townsend--Holtby--Siggy  
-----------Defoe  
 
After looking at the lineups, this is legitimately a pretty even match up!  The Spurs ""A"" team have a stronger attack whereas the ""B"" team actually has our near first choice defense.
  
Who do you think would win?  Lets assume everyone is ""Healthy"" but not super amazing in form (ie no World Class Adebayor,  no pre-injury Kaboul).
  
Adebayor/Soldado/Eriksen/Lamela  vs  Sandro/Vert/Walker/Rose/Kaboul  would be seriously entertaining to watch.
  
If you want to take it a step further, we should compare our ""B"" team last weekend vs other ""B"" teams that did not feature for teams with depth i.e Chelsea or City bench vs ours.

My 2p: It was stupid, naive and wrong. Even if it wasn't a fascist salute, it was in support of his friend who has said (OK I paraphrase) ""It's a shame the gas chambers aren't around any more"". That is unacceptable for an Albion player to support while wearing the shirt on the pitch. He deserves the 5 match ban under the new FA code of conduct. It's a massive blow for Albion, but for a club with a strong anti racism past its not OK to defend it now.

I would be interested to know if Morgan Amalfitano or any other French players on the pitch immediately recognised it as offensive, it strikes me they would have a really interesting insight into this to see whether it was a big deal or blown out of proportion.

That said, whether he meant to cause offense or not, he did and he did it by his actions. He is to blame and we need to accept the consequences of his actions.

Interested to hear other opinions.

It's out in his hall and he has to dispose of it; Sergeant Hathaway suggests taking it to the skip which seems like an eminently sensible idea to me. ""We're police officers, man!"" protests Lewis. They do in fact toss it in the skip, skulking around like a couple of teenagers after curfew in the dark, running away from the scene of the crime when a neighbor peeks out the window.

He's drastically anxious that he knows exactly how he will die and that this upcoming incarnation will be the last.

Let's have a little fun looking back at our club's 2013 ( don't lie to me and tell me you're busy at work, no one's doing fuck all today and we all know it). We'll include a link to the full winning match in the sidebar. 

**The rules**: 
   
- Submit your pick for the single 'best' match of 2013. This can be based on a defining moment, importance to the club, entertainment value, hilarity, etc. Pick what you like and we'll take a vote.

- Try and keep top level posts concise. dd/mm competition - opponent should suffice. You can put your explanation if necessary in a secondary comment below but for ease of searching try not to include the wall of text about how the game was on when your mates dog came out of his coma in your top level submission. 

- Please try not to duplicate. Look at the top comments to see if the match you've chosen has already been submitted, and upvote it if it was instead of creating a new post. If you would like to expound on it's significance, you can do that in the discussion below that top level comment.

After this year's Christmas Special an interesting thought occurred to me: what if the Doctor loses his 'ego' during every regeneration? Let me explain:
I was re-watching Eccleston's and Tennant's regeneration episodes to recall the style choices and how the show's evolved since '05 and an interesting thought occurred to me. From a real-world POV, the regeneration speeches can be seen as the actor's commentary on their role as the doctor. (e.g. 9th ""You were fantastic, and so was I"" 10th- ""I don't want to go"", 11th - ""I will always remember when the Doctor was me"")
But from a story POV, there is always a certain level of trepidation and sadness when the regens are coming up and that could be the fact that the Doctor knows his current consciousness will die. When the new one comes in, the memories are intact, the body is intact (albeit different) but it's a new consciousness entirely. Almost like someone entering a room that has been described to them for years so they know what it should look like and where everything is, they've just only never been in it (until now.)
What do you guys think about this hypothesis?

##Loans

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Coady spent the 2nd consecutive week on the bench in Sheffield United's Boxing day 1-1 draw against Oldham. Having played the full 90 minutes of 4 consecutive games prior to this spell, it was further surprising to see him start from the bench in Sheffield's next game against Krisoffer Peterson's Tranmere. Although, he came on for the last 20 minutes in the game Sheffield won 3-1, it remains surprising that his game time appears to fluctuate.

**Jack Robinson at Blackpool** -- Robinson's Blackpool broke their 4 game losing streak, as they met Leeds at home on Boxing day with a 1-1 draw. Unfortunately, despite getting this valuable point, they again had a man sent off. With Kirk Broadfoot getting sent off for a second yellow card in the 90th minute. Furthermore, Blackpool couldn't bring this momentum through to their next fixture in their 0-1 home loss to Brighton. It's fair to say, with 1 point from their last possible 18, Blackpool are in freefall. Although, it's not all bad news as Robinson is getting consistent game time, having features the full 90 minutes in all 6 of Blackpool's fixtures since he returned from suspension.

**Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City** -- Assaidi was unlucky, having opened the scoring with [this](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x18vpwc_goal-oussama-assaidi-vs-newcastle-united_sport) lovely curling effort. However, with Stoke on the wrong end of 2 red cards in 5 minutes, Assaidi was sacrificed at half time. Stoke went on to lose the game 5-1. It didn't get better for Stoke, and Assaidi, with a tough away trip to Spurs at the weekend. Although he did register 90 minutes, he couldn't help Stoke in their 3-0 loss.

**Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC** -- Borini finally seems to be getting consistent game time under Gus Poyet, and his performances seem to be warranting his place. In their 1-0 win over Everton (blueshite), Borini's Sunderland took the lead early on through Ki's strike from the penalty spot. The earned penalty also resulted in Howard being sent off and The Ev going down to 10 men. It wasn't straight forward from here, with Ev offering some pressure, Borini had to clear a goal bound effort off the line. Similarly, Borini started Sunderland's next game away to Cardiff, and although he looked threatening, he was forced off at half time when he collapsed. He was rushed to hospital, although he has tweeted that he is fine and the feint was just due to dehydration.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Similarly to Robinson, Wisdom is registering consistent game time for his Championship club. Although, differently to Robinson, Wisdom's club is very much the in-form side of the league. However, this didn't show in their Boxing day game when they drew 1-1 Huddersfield, although that game did see Derby's striker Chris Martin miss a penalty and Huddersfield get a 86th minute equaliser. Derby had better fortune against bottom of the league Barnsley, with a 2-1 win, Wisdom earning a very impressive assist (if anyone has a working video, please share).

**Adam Morgan at Yeovil Town** -- Morgan's Yeovil are in poor form, registering their 2nd and 3rd consistent loss. Unfortunately, Morgan didn't play in either of these two losses, the first a 3-0 loss to Bournemouth, the second a 5-1 loss to Huddersfield. 

**Craig Roddan at Carlisle United** -- Simiarly to Morgan, Roddan spent the 2 games I've covering on the bench. Although, Roddan's Carlisle had better luck than Morgan's Yeovil. The first a disappointing 1-0 home loss to Preston, although the second was a more promising 2-1 win over Peterborough.

**Krisoffer Peterson at Tranmere** -- Peterson continued to impress, playing the full 90 minutes against Shrewsbury and Conor Coady's Sheffield United. Tranmere were 1-0 winner over Shrewsbury, in a tight game between to equal sides. The latter game, being more of a struggle, Tranmere simply couldn't match Sheffield United - who have a good squad despite low league position. I like to think Coady and Peterson had a friendly word post game.

Classic Who, even though I am an older fan. The show has always had its ups and downs, but Time of The Doctor seemed to me to be one of the ""downs"". Here are my thoughts on what needs to be done and I want to hear your thoughts as well.
No more angst-ridden Timelords.  Doctor Who is a hero. We don't want to hear him whine about his regeneration (""I don't want to go""). It's like the Craig era of James Bond movies. Bond is a hero. I don't want him to get on a leather couch and tell me about his mother !
Don't sexualize The Doctor. It was much more fun when the writers left it up to the viewers filthy imaginations whether The Doctor was bending her over the TARDIS console. (Heck, it always worked for me!) No more Magical Companions. The Dynamic should mostly be a companion (like a TV viewer) getting the chance to travel in time and space. And they don't always have to fall in love with The Doctor !  Give the Sonic Screwdriver a rest. Let the Doctor grow as a person in each regeneration and stop having him lie to these companions he supposedly cares for so much. I'll give Moffat his due, but it's time for a new Showrunner. I don't think the old serial format would work today, but no more split seasons.  I think I'm done at least for now. Your thoughts ?

It might have been a family of giants, and they're kind of bulbous and puppetish. At one point, a giant is chasing the pair down a hallway, and the camera keeps cutting between them looking back at it and a low shot of the giant running while roaring and flailing its arms. The pair being chased are throwing their clothes behind them as they run, because the giant might be able to smell whatever's on their clothes or something, and the giant gobbles the clothes up with its massive puppet mouth.

Now that January is almost upon us, and Mata has only started 10 of Chelsea's 19 EPL matches (and been subbed in on 2), it seems odd that there is no talk of a Mata transfer this window.  

Now, I know from following him on Twitter that Mata is an extremely loyal player and has a great relationship with the Chelsea fans, which would preclude him from wanting to move to another Premier League team.  Still, there are a couple big reasons why I think there's a chance he'd be open to leave this window, and why Liverpool ought to make a move for him:

1. The loss of his starting spot could have huge ramifications on his chances of a World Cup spot for Spain, especially with young playmakers like Koke and Isco getting significantly more playing time (and creating/scoring loads of goals). 

2. He's not a young player anymore. In fact, he's 25 year old, so the coming years are supposed to be his prime.  With Mourinho talking about staying at Chelsea for the next 12 years, however, it seems unlikely that Mata will ever recover his place.

3. The examples of Coutinho and Sturridge show that Liverpool has track record of taking out-of-favor players from big teams and jumpstarting their careers. 

4. Mata has the moniker of ""the ability to play in any of the three positions behind the striker,"" which Brendan has a history of praising.  He's also Spanish, which Brendan loves, and is a total team player. 

5. While no one doubts Coutinho's raw talent, his form (especially with regards to his passing) has dipped lately and he could use the mentorship and competition that Mata will bring. At 21 Coutinho should not be allowed to be complacent, and a club like Liverpool should not be reliant on a someone that young to make all of their killer passes.

6. Having Mata would give the team the tactical flexibility to play 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 from time to time even when Sturridge is healthy (he'd be the super-sub, naturally).  Sturridge and Mata were friends at Chelsea (Danny gave him the excellent nickname ""Johnny Kills,"" a literal translation of Mata's name), so I think he'd be able to live with it. 

7. Speaking of flexibility, our only left footed attacking player right now is Iago Aspas, who apparently doesn't cut it.  Mata brings balance to the team, and excellent set-piece delivery as well.  

TL;DR Juan Mata is an amazingly talented player who in all probability can be gotten for a large, but affordable, fee, and he would instantly boost our top-four and title aspirations.

I've read some of your conversations and you seem friendly enough. Which is exactly what I'm looking for, friendly British pub enthusiasts who might be able to help me navigate from north to South visiting as many landmarks and local pubs as possible.

1. Game is played by three or more players.
2. Each player picks 12 cards from a library box (Tardis colors?).
3. Each card contains a question which can range from ""What is your favorite color"" to things that are a bit more... personal.
4. Each player also receives a red ""silence"" card. This card is really a token.
5. Each player takes a turn asking another active player a question from their hand. The player must answer truthfully or play a red ""silence"" card.
6. If a player plays a silence card then they can abstain from answering but eliminate themselves from the game.
7. After 12 rounds of playing the player(s) left (those who have not played their silence cards) win the game.

*Multi-generational rule:*
If at the end of 12 rounds there is no one winner or all but one player has played their silence card before the 12 round, the game restarts and is played until there is a single winner after a 12 round game.

This time instead of planting a message on either the Doctor or the Master, they ask for the Doctor's real name to see if it's now safe to return. They're not invaders or conquerers, they're now refugees requesting permission to enter. Further, they're not forcing their way in by guiding themselves int with the five point star, but are using the tear in reality to call for the Doctor to pull them through. Finally, when the Doctor is in trouble, the opt to save him instead of going through the tear themselves. When in the first instance they only thought of Gallifrey and their own needs, in the new reality they opt to save the Doctor and wait for another opportunity.

I don't know if this means anything because I don't know if the events of the End of Time happened anymore. But it's interesting to see how different the Time Lords behave between the first reality and the second reality.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,A comparison of the two times the Time Lords have returned,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1u4lor/a_comparison_of_the_two_times_the_time_lords_have/

So they all arrive, and find out that what the signal is, is the eternal question, ""Dr. Who?""

If the good Doctor tells them beyond the crack his name, and he is trapped inside a truth field, so he cannot lie if he answers, then they will know that they are knocking on the right crack to the right universe, and so will break through, bringing the whole of the timelocked, pocketuniversed Time War with it. 

And so he, as well as the entire town and probably the entire planet, for good measure, is #1 on everybody's exterminate list, so that he cannot say and bring Gallifrey back. Understandable. He sends off Clara so she doesn't get hurt in the warzone, and is left without a ride, defending the poor citizens of Christmas for 300 years from being exterminated with him. ect, ect.

What I don't understand, is how come when Clara whispers into the crack that they've got the right universe and the right Doctor, that magically solves the conundrum of the Time Lords bringing Gallifrey and the Time War back to be finished. Sure, Time Lord high council types can donate regeneration energy, and can even extend the life cycle, which might make some sense what with the Doctor giving them hope in being sealed in a painting pocket universe, but the underlying problem wasn't solved.

The Doctor was telling Wilfred that the times lords were returning, and as Wilfred goes on to say that would it not be a happy thing, the doctor says:

""That's how I choose to remember them. The Time Lords of old. But then they went to war. An endless war. And it changed them. Right to the core. You've seen my enemies, Wilf. The Time Lords are more dangerous than any of them. ""

Alright, we definitely see that in the rest of the episode.

But now in the 50th were getting a completely different reaction towards bringing back the time lords. Like it was a clean slate and someone was thinking ""ya those episodes, i never watched them so im just going to go with my gut on this one and say that they were nice people""

Now im only assuming that both these events happened during the last days of Gallifrey. (It tells us that in the 50th but i don't remember in The End of Time). It would only make sense since since now they are on there final days and anyone would go mad. But even if The End of Time's situation was sometime way before the final days, it would only support that the time lords were indeed ""mad"" ""crazy"" ""dangerous"" way before those final days and would make it more obvious not to bring them back.

This is just my thinking on the situation. Maybe you guys can help clear everything up (and for those who may have similar thoughts.)

We have probably all read about this by now, and this excites the majority of us. I'm ready for the show to feel different again. We had a different show during the 9th/10th era, a fresh take at the beginning of the 11ths reign and it will happen again with Capaldi.

A lot of us have commented on how different it was to see the quick Face Swap between Smith and Capaldi at the end of the episode. 

To me, it is quite obvious, this is Moffat's way of showing us, through a cinematic aspect, that the show is different now.

This season was so well written and featured so many great stories. David delivered the knockout performance I expected from him throughout the season, and Martha Jones was an amazing companion! I didn't think life Post-Rose would be very kind but I very much enjoyed Martha and the role she played all season. Some of my favorite episodes happened this season, with The Shakespeare Code, and Blink(the first episode I ever saw) occurring this season. I really enjoyed the two-episode arc where the Doctor was John Smith, because it really made you take a step back and think about how sad the Doctor's life really is and what he misses out on. Also, the arc with the Master was brilliant, and seeing David's reaction to the whole ordeal was great, he did a great job reacting the whole thought of not being alone.


I've only recently become a fan of Doctor Who, but I can tell this is gonna be a long, amazing fandom. I plan on bringing in the new year with the Tardis, sonic screwdriver, and the Doctor, and I know it's going to be a fantastic start. Anyways, Happy New Years everyone!

We both recognized that the Doctor originally had twelve regenerations from One to Eleven. That much was clear. Where we differed was how the new cycle worked. My cousin was of the opinion that the Doctor, now Twelve, has twelve more regenerations, and that Capaldi's Doctor is now the first of thirteen new face. I disagreed, claiming that one regeneration was used to regenerate Smith to Capaldi, meaning that Capaldi has eleven regenerations left.

And that's it! Chelsea thoroughly deserve the three points. Mourinho's men win 3-0.

90
We will have 4 minutes of time added on.

88
Chelsea playing a bit of keep ball now. Southampton will just want the final whistle.
Yellow for Clyne for a late one on Azpilicueta.

85
Hazard off Essien on.

84
Really impressive performance from Chelsea. They've had too much for Southampton in the second half.

GOAL! Flag stayed down and Oscar continued his run. Slight deflection on his shot past Davis. 3-0.

80
Southampton looking like they are missing a little bit of self belief at the moment.

78
Chelsea all over Southampton. Chambers with a rare mistake.
Davis off Ward-Prowse on.

75
Chelsea win another corner and are in firm control of this one now.

73
Great strike but fantastic approach play by Oscar. He's been electric.

GOAL! Awesome strike from Willian. Oscar, the other sub, with the assist. Davis no 
chance.

70
Oscar does well down the left but his cross is a poor one.

69
Southampton corner from the left but Chelsea, as they have all afternoon, clear well.

68
Clyne pushing forward well down the left. Chelsea holding a decent shape at the moment though.

66
In fact, Lambert connected with the ball but he didn't get enough on it.

66
CHANCE! Great ball by Clyne down the left and Lambert is inches away. Unlucky.

65
Chambers hooks the ball away but Southampton struggling to control Oscar and Hazard at the moment.

Lovren booked. Chelsea gathering momentum. Hazard fouled by the corner flag.
62

Willian nearly has a chance at goal but Southampton get enough bodies back eventually.
Cork off Lambert on.

GOAL! Torres nods in from close range after Oscar's cross is deflected over Davis and onto the post.

59
Exellent defending by Chambers who heads the cross behind. He's been superb this afternoon.

58
Southampton corner from the left. Cech clears really well.

57
Hazard getting on the ball more and more now. It was his ball to Oscar in the first instance.

Yellow for Oscar. He was clean through and went down. Good decision.
Double Chelsea substitution: Willian and Oscar on, Mata and Schurrle off.
Cork receives a yellow for an earlier foul. Chelsea win a corner.

51
Azpilicueta gets a slice on good luck as his clearance rebounds off Clyne and behind for a goal kick.

49
Hazard is fouled by Chambers. Looked harsh.

47
Chambers with another run down the right claims a corner. Chelsea make a mess of the delivery but eventually clear.

46
Yellow for Ramirez for a late one on Cole.

46
Credit to both side's in the first half for trying to get the ball down and play despite the testing conditions.

46
Chelsea start the second half.

##Loans

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Coady spent the 2nd consecutive week on the bench in Sheffield United's Boxing day 1-1 draw against Oldham. Having played the full 90 minutes of 4 consecutive games prior to this spell, it was further surprising to see him start from the bench in Sheffield's next game against Krisoffer Peterson's Tranmere. Although, he came on for the last 20 minutes in the game Sheffield won 3-1, it remains surprising that his game time appears to fluctuate.

**Jack Robinson at Blackpool** -- Robinson's Blackpool broke their 4 game losing streak, as they met Leeds at home on Boxing day with a 1-1 draw. Unfortunately, despite getting this valuable point, they again had a man sent off. With Kirk Broadfoot getting sent off for a second yellow card in the 90th minute. Furthermore, Blackpool couldn't bring this momentum through to their next fixture in their 0-1 home loss to Brighton. It's fair to say, with 1 point from their last possible 18, Blackpool are in freefall. Although, it's not all bad news as Robinson is getting consistent game time, having features the full 90 minutes in all 6 of Blackpool's fixtures since he returned from suspension.

**Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City** -- Assaidi was unlucky, having opened the scoring with [this](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x18vpwc_goal-oussama-assaidi-vs-newcastle-united_sport) lovely curling effort. However, with Stoke on the wrong end of 2 red cards in 5 minutes, Assaidi was sacrificed at half time. Stoke went on to lose the game 5-1. It didn't get better for Stoke, and Assaidi, with a tough away trip to Spurs at the weekend. Although he did register 90 minutes, he couldn't help Stoke in their 3-0 loss.

**Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC** -- Borini finally seems to be getting consistent game time under Gus Poyet, and his performances seem to be warranting his place. In their 1-0 win over Everton (blueshite), Borini's Sunderland took the lead early on through Ki's strike from the penalty spot. The earned penalty also resulted in Howard being sent off and The Ev going down to 10 men. It wasn't straight forward from here, with Ev offering some pressure, Borini had to clear a goal bound effort off the line. Similarly, Borini started Sunderland's next game away to Cardiff, and although he looked threatening, he was forced off at half time when he collapsed. He was rushed to hospital, although he has tweeted that he is fine and the feint was just due to dehydration.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Similarly to Robinson, Wisdom is registering consistent game time for his Championship club. Although, differently to Robinson, Wisdom's club is very much the in-form side of the league. However, this didn't show in their Boxing day game when they drew 1-1 Huddersfield, although that game did see Derby's striker Chris Martin miss a penalty and Huddersfield get a 86th minute equaliser. Derby had better fortune against bottom of the league Barnsley, with a 2-1 win, Wisdom earning a very impressive assist (if anyone has a working video, please share).

**Adam Morgan at Yeovil Town** -- Morgan's Yeovil are in poor form, registering their 2nd and 3rd consistent loss. Unfortunately, Morgan didn't play in either of these two losses, the first a 3-0 loss to Bournemouth, the second a 5-1 loss to Huddersfield. 

**Craig Roddan at Carlisle United** -- Simiarly to Morgan, Roddan spent the 2 games I've covering on the bench. Although, Roddan's Carlisle had better luck than Morgan's Yeovil. The first a disappointing 1-0 home loss to Preston, although the second was a more promising 2-1 win over Peterborough.

**Krisoffer Peterson at Tranmere** -- Peterson continued to impress, playing the full 90 minutes against Shrewsbury and Conor Coady's Sheffield United. Tranmere were 1-0 winner over Shrewsbury, in a tight game between to equal sides. The latter game, being more of a struggle, Tranmere simply couldn't match Sheffield United - who have a good squad despite low league position. I like to think Coady and Peterson had a friendly word post game.

**Match Facts:**

**Head-to-head**

* Chelsea have won six of their past eight league and cup games against Southampton (D1, L1).

* Their sole defeat was the 2-1 loss at the St Mary's Stadium on 30 March 2013.

**Southampton**

* Saints have lost five of their past eight league games (W1, D2).

* They kept six clean sheets in their first nine top-flight matches, but have recorded just one shut-out in the subsequent 10 games.

* If Saints lose it will be the first time they have suffered back-to-back home league defeats under Mauricio Pochettino.

* Rickie Lambert is one shy of 100 league goals for Southampton.

**Chelsea**

* Chelsea have won four of the seven league games in which they have conceded the opening goal this season, collecting a total of 13 points - the best record in the top flight.

* The Blues have conceded 37% of their league goals from set pieces - the highest ratio in the Premier League.

* Eden Hazard's tally of eight league goals is greater than the combined total of Samuel Eto'o (3), Fernando Torres (2) and Demba Ba (1).

* No striker scored an away league goal for Chelsea in 2013. Fernando Torres was the last centre-forward to net on the road for the Blues, doing so in a 3-1 win at Sunderland on 8 December 2012.

**DAYS SINCE**

* Arsenal won a trophy: 3,147

* Liverpool won the league: 8,642

**Match Events**

[](//#info) *14:56* - *The teams make their way onto the pitch.*

[](//#whistle-big) *0'* - Atkinson and Southampton get us underway at a wet St. Mary's.

1' - Torres already challenging the Southampton keeper, but the chance fizzles out.

3' - Torres again with the chance, but can't hit the target. Good start from Chelsea.

5' - Schurlle with a great chance off of the corner, but puts it just wide.

5' - Lovren down after a collision in the box. Looks like he might have lost a tooth? Ouch.

12' - Dave is walking around gingerly, holding his back. Eva is on it, don't worry.

13' - Ramires with the chance off of a Chelsea break, but the keeper blocks it in time.

17' - Southampton threatens after a good run of play, but fail to convert.

20' - Torres with a wonderful run down the left, but misses the target in the end. Looking very good so far.

26' - Hazard and Mata with the 1-2, but Hazard can't get to the ball which is scooped up by Davis.

27' - Lallana can't finish the chance after a nice run by Chambers.

27' - Dave holding his groin now. Don't worry, Eva is on that too.

32' - Free kick from Ramirez can't quite find Lovren at the back post. Still 0-0.

33' - Mikel gets rugby tackled by Lallana.

35' - Ramires does his best Hazard impression, dribbling from half-way all the way into the box but misses the shot.

37' - Hazard rabona flick ftw. Play leads to a chance, but ultimately fizzles out again. 

39' - A wonderful pass from Azpi plays Ramires in who crosses the ball which eventually comes to Schurrle, who's shot is blocked. Good play again from Chelsea. 

43' - Counter by Ramires and Chelsea leads to a Torres blocked shot.

45' - Four minutes of added time are to be added on.

Do you think its got something to do with the way we play? They all operated as single strikers at their previous clubs and i cant think of a side with more creativity in behind the number nine with the likes of Oscar, Hazard, Mata, Willian and Schurley to line them up all they have to do is knock them in.

Is this something that's going to be resolved by a Martinez/Falcao/Rooney signing or is the problem deeper routed? Or i could be completely wrong and a resourceful forward like Rooney could be the key to finishing games off instead of scrapping over a 1-0 win? Or maybe a clinical finisher like Falcao who's not going to keep throwing away golden chances (Eto'o last game anyone?). Could be we need a target man with a bit of flair like Jackson Martinez? 

I've got no stats or spreadsheets to back up any of this i'm just a regular Chelsea fan wondering what your opinions are on the whole Striker situation?

--------------------------------------------------------

**Match events:**

**7'** AAAARRRGGGH! just setting up the match thread and GOAL! nice finish from Diame to put our nerves at ease.

**0-1**

**11'** Cross from Diame leading to West Ham corner... what is to come from this?

**12'** The answer to that... Nothing. Diarra goes up, but it skids off his head for a goal kick.

**13'** Once again, West Ham give away a stupid free kick in a deadly position. Luckily Tarrabt hits the wall, and it safely loops up to Jussi

**15'** Taarabt finds an ince of space and immediately looks for the shot. We need to watch him.


**16'** Arne Riise looks to pull a classic goal out of his locker once again. Fortunately his outside of the area strike flies just wide.

**18'** nice passing sequence from Collison and Maiga, leaves Collison 1on1 with the keeper. Unfortunately the flag is up against Maiga.

**22'** The second goal was begging. Fulham putting themselves under pressure, and giving the ball away. diame with a nice cross to set up an easy header from Nolan. Unfortunately he puts it straight at the keeper. West Ham on top.

**24'** Again Taarabt getting an ince of space 22 yards out. Goes for the shot once again, but easy save for Jussi

**25'** First good sequence from Fulham. The ball is squared across the pitch to Arne Riise. Everyone thinks he is going for ths shot, but he dinks a little ball behind Berbatovs head. Berbs follows with a volley, although the power is lacking. leading to an easy save from Jussi

**27'** Scott Parker win's a corner after weaving into the box from the right hand corner. Amorebieta gets onto the cross, and Maiga clears off the line. Fulham coming back into the game.

**30'** oh dear. Noble is down as we give away another corner. It's looking like his game is over. Huge Blow for West Ham

**Substitution** Razan Rat on for Mark Noble

**31'** GOAL. Fulham score straight from the resulting corner. McCartney loses Sidwell as he rises to put his header into the net.

**1-1**

**33'** West Ham falling apart as Fulham turn it on. Fulham hit the post twice in less than 30 seconds, and win a corner which is cleared.

**36'** Taarabt goes for a dive and gets a warning from the ref

**38'** AGAIN West Ham give acres of space away to Taarabt. luckily his shot hits the back of the Centreback 

**39'** West Ham playing a dangerous game. Giving away a free kick on the right hand side which is curled into the 6 yard box. Clearing header drops to a fulham player who strikes it against the back of west ham shirts, bouncing out for ANOTHER corner.

**42:** Possession stats showing where the momentum of the game is currently. Fulham 61% West Ham 39%

**43'** FOR FUCK SAKE. Our Captain, and 'mature player' gets himself sent off again. A stupid reaction 20 yards away from the ball, he rakes his boot down Amorebieta's leg.

**Red Card** Kevin Nolan (West Ham United)

**46'** Only silver lining so far is that Sendoras is having a complete mare today. Will he give away a peno/red card today? 

**Half Time: Fulham 1-1 West Ham**

[Half Time Statistics](http://imgur.com/rcI6eXT)

**45'** it's all go as we kick off at Craven Cottage. 

**47'** Ball is fed into Riise in the box. He turns a west ham player before blasting a shot which is saved by Jussi from 8 yards

**48'** Ball bounces to Parker outside the box from a corner. However his tame striker goes straight to Jussi. Fulham still on top.

**49'** Rieter puts in another lovely ball from the right hand side. McCartney gets a defensive head on it, which nearly squirms past Jussi. 


**52'** Fulham piling on the pressure. A short corner to Rieter, who then runs directly into the box and squares to Duff who puts his shot JUST over the bar

**Substiution** Downing on for Diame

**57'** how haven't Fulham scored? the ball pops up for goalscoring opportunities 5 times within 30 seconds.

**60'** Fulham waste another chance. great ball in again from Riether, straight to Taarabt's head. Jussi saves, but the ball bounces straight back to taarabt who snatches and misses the empty net.

**62'** ANOTHER dangerous free kick given away by West Ham. Rat pulls a fulham player's arm, which could have been a penalty 1 yards later.

**62'** Riise lines up the free kick and blasts it! Rat is first out of the wall and sends it looping over the bar for a free kick.

**Stats:** Possesion telling the story. Fulham 72% West Ham 28%

**65' Goal** Was always coming. Kacalinic squares across the penalty area, Parker shoots wide, but Berbatov puts his foot on it and steers it into the net.

**2-1**

**Substitution:** Bent coming on for Taarabt (FUL); C.Cole on for Maiga (WHU)

**70'** Great save from Jussi as Bent is through 1-on-1 on goal, although his shot was tame and straight at the keeper

Fulham have dominated this match so far, which is only helped by the fact West Ham have been down to 10 men from the first half.

**74'** ironic cheers from the away fans as west ham string more than 2 passes together.

**76'** West Ham have their first chance of the second half from a free kick, which meets Diarra for a free header from 8 yards out. He puts it 10 metres over the bar.

**Substitution:** Kasami on for Duff (FUL)

**87'** Fulham corner coming up. How they aren't 5 goals up is confusing my hungover mind.

##Pre-Game Commentary
---------------------
* We definitely need 3 points from this game to put some distance between United and us, and for us to make a serious positive start to 2014.
* Arctic Monkeys, HAIM and Daft Punk will all soundtrack today's pre-match build-up at Old Trafford. If anyone's interested.
* Everton, Southampton and Newcastle have dropped points today, making it extremely important for us to get those 3 points and put some distance between us and Newcastle, Southampton and Man United - and for us to also come within a point of Everton.
* [The Daily Mail is reporting that Vertonghen and Kaboul are back in training.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2532186/Jan-Vertonghen-Younes-Kaboul-return-training-giving-Sherwood-New-Year-defensive-boost.html)
* Teams out warming up and it's pouring down in Manchester!
* Get set for the game lads! Players have shook hands and are set to kick off!


---------------------
##Gamecast
---------------------
* [](//#whistle) **First half - we're off!**
* 1 min : Valencia tries a long ball to Welbeck, Lloris comes out to punch it clear.
* 2 min : Just getting information that Naughton got injured during warm-up and Fredericks has taken his place on the bench.
* 3 min : Strong start from United - they're passing the ball well and have Spurs pinned into their own half.
* 3 min : Each time Rooney drops in deep, Capoue goes with him. Style of United's play suggests that they're looking at exposing the lack of pace in the center backs.
* 5 min : Same style of play from United - this is a little unnerving. Welbeck breaks through the middle and a very long ball from Valencia finds him one on one with Lloris but it's fumbled away. Stay sharp Daws and Chiriches.
* 5 min : **Shot on goal by Manchester United**. They work the ball really well through United's half and Smalling smacks a ball straight into Lloris which trickles wide of the goal.
* 7 min : Dawson getting some treatment on his left knee due to a knock. Seems okay though. Jogs off the field to come back on.
* 9 min : For fuck's sake Chiriches. Clear the fucking ball. Typical Chiriches, he has the chance to clear the ball from United pressure, but he decides to dribble and the ball is pinched off him, as a result Capoue has to foul. Rooney poised to take a free kick from perfect distance.
* 10 min : Thankfully the attempt is well high. Please let that be a lesson learned, Vlad.
* 13 min : Capoue gives the ball away for the 10th time.
* 14 min : First chance for Spurs! Ade bounds down the left, finds Soldado at the top of the box who snips the ball through to Lennon absolutely beautifully. Lennon's at a tight angle but smacks the ball into De Gea's feet. We looked sharp for that one move.
* 15 min : There's a need to get Dembele more on the ball.
* 16 min : Danny Rose finds himself in the middle of the field, 35 yards from goal and does the only thing that he does in such a position - shoot. Shot is high and wide, well high.
* 18 min : It's been 18 minutes, and Capoue's pass completion rate has been **50%**.
* 20 min : It has been all United so far. All United.
* 23 min : United with 64% possession so far.
* 24 min : Spurs with the ball in the middle of the park, playing it around to each other trying to get an attack together. Lennon hangs the ball up in the air for Ade to attack, who lets it play on for the Spurs player on the left wing who at the moment was no one.
* 30 min : Nothing major to report in the last 5 minutes. Scrappy play from both sides, but United still seeing a lot more of the ball.
* 32 min : Soldado gets the ball to fall to Ade who takes a shot at goal from 22 yards, it's not a bad shot, but off-target.
* 33 min : Spurs get the ball forward, ball falls to Capoue whose cross is too far.
* 34 min : [](//#ball) **ADEBAYOR HAS SCORED!!!** What a goal! That is stunning from Eriksen and Ade! Eriksen chips the ball into the box with his left foot, Ade leaps higher than Smalling and nods the ball into the EXACT bottom corner! The ball kisses the post and goes in! **SPURS LEAD BY A GOAL TO NIL!** [GIF](https://vine.co/v/hVIqdOnPHB5)
* 39 min : Valencia sends in a dangerous ball into the box for the first time - his previous deliveries have been less than average, Dawson gets it away though.
* 39 min : Oh dear! Soldado misses! Ade with a great through ball to Lennon, he beats Evra easily with pace and fizzes in a REALLY great ball to Soldado. Soldado slides in and connects with his knee. That really should have been the second goal for Spurs.
* 40 min : United take their 7th corner of the game. Well defended by Spurs.
* 41 min : [](//#yellow) Wayne Rooney goes into the book for a pull-down on Dembele.
* 45 min : For those of you wondering, Chiriches hasn't learnt his lesson. He ventures out with the ball, plays it to Ade and then takes the position of a Center Forward. It eventually comes down to being Spurs' first corner of the game due to a mistake by Smalling.
* 45 min : Make that our second corner. Eriksen taking these.
* 45 min : **Two minutes of added time.**
* 45+ min : Spurs' composure has definitely grown in the game. We're niggling near 40% of possession of the ball now, and aren't as pressed back as we were. We however, do need to score another goal to afford us to sit back in the last 15 - 20 minutes of the game. We shouldn't be thinking about doing that with just a goal in the bag.
* [](//#whistle) **First half - we're done!**
* Those of you milling about and wondering what else there is to do in this thread, here's Ade's celebration after scoring: [GIF](http://gfycat.com/FantasticLikableGrayreefshark)
* [](//#whistle) **Second half - here we go!**
* 46 min : No changes from either side here. 
* 47 min : Walker has Januzaj well in control here, let's hope Rose can do the same with Valencia in the second half.
* 51 min : Atmosphere in Old Trafford has gone a little flat now. Not a whole lot happening, Welbeck had a chance over the top from a ball by Carrick but it was weak.
* 55 min : More of the same now. Dembele not quite coming into the game as much as we'd like - he could be the key here to ensuring that we stay ahead and we have 3 points in the bag.
* 57 min : Ade runs from the left back position to the right wing forward position with the ball. Showing some determination.
* 57 min : Kagawa is coming on for United soon.
* 58 min : Welbeck goes down in the box, and Howard Webb DOES NOT give a penalty. Oh WOW! Replays shows that was an INSANE dive. Should be getting a yellow for that. Really RIDICULOUS dive from Welbeck there.
* 61 min: Double change for United. [](//#up) Kagawa [](//#down) Smalling [](//#up) Chicharito [](//#down) Carrick
* 63 min : Rooney has dropped much deeper, almost replacing Carrick - and Kagawa has taken the #10 role from Rooney. Welbeck and Hernandez playing up top, with Valencia at right back.
* 64 min : Our possession shows that we're up to 47% possession.
* 64 min : Rooney's dropped deeper, Capoue probably isn't going to have to man mark him any more, and to get more possession and circulate the ball more - Benataleb is coming on for Spurs.
* 65 min : [](//#up) Bentaleb [](//#down) Capoue
* 65 min : **ERIKSEN HAS FUCKING SCORED!!!!** Spurs break with Adebayor, he plays the ball to Soldado - suddenly Lennon fucking cannons through from midfield and tears into the box, plays the ball across the box and Eriksen charges into the box and leaps ahead of Valencia and heads the ball home! **TWO GOALS TO NIL FOR SPURS!**
* 68 min : Fuck. Welbeck scored. Janujaz shifted to the right wing, he isn't picked up at all by Rose, he plays the ball into the path of Welbeck and he isn't marked - chips the ball over a charging Lloris to score.
* 69 min : This does not look good. **Adebayor is being taken off on the stretcher.** Chadli is coming on in his place. No idea what happened there.
* 69 min : [](//#up) Chadli [](//#down) Adebayor
* 71 min : United suddenly have a lot of spark going forward. Shot from Januzaj is just wide.
* 72 min : Pressure keeps mounting, I don't think we'll be able to sustain this pressure from 18 minutes.
* 73 min : Rose is being toyed with by Januzaj - he's sending crosses flying into the box each time he's on the ball.
* 75 min : Umm... Kane is coming on in place of Soldado. What is going on Tim?
* 75 min : [](//#up) Kane [](//#down) Soldado
* 78 min : Chaos in the Spurs box as Januzaj skins Rose and rifles a ball into the box, it's dealt with in some manner by Spurs - not convincing at all. Chadli needs to step up his game and come back and defend with Rose to mark Januzaj now.
* 78 min : Not sure why Kane has been brought on, he's looking off the pace of the game and it doesn't look he's really used to a pressure game at all. Very nervy on the ball. COME ON HARRY KANE.
* 80 min : [](//#yellow) Dembele picks up a yellow for a late challenge from behind on Cleverley.
* 82 min : Spurs with a little more possession now. Lloris with a couple of minutes to breath easy.
* 84 min : Lennon with some beautiful play there! He's been quite a spark hasn't he! Kane finds a nice through ball for him, Lennon beats one man, checks back and beats another and has a shot at De Gea but it's straight in his hands.
* 84 min : United making their last change. Young is coming on for Cleverley.
* 85 min : Right, so now that the center mids for United are basically Rooney and Kagawa - it's important that we now establish dominance in midfield. They have Januzaj and Young on the wings - Welbeck and Hernandez up front and Rooney and Kagawa in midfield. So very attacking - with no real pivot in there except Rooney - we must take control now.
* 86 min : OH DEAR OH DEAR! A long ball played forward - Lloris comes charging off his line and as Young dips the ball over him he almost takes him out, Dawson clears from two yards off the line - Howard Webb says nothing doing!
* 87 min : Just in the next frame of play it seems like Januzaj was taken down at the edge of the box but Webb says nothing doing again.
* 88 min : [](//#yellow) Januzaj goes into the book for that piece of simulation.
* 90 min : Into the final minute of play now...
* 90 min : Rooney takes a shot at goal from the edge of the box, Lloris thankfully saves. Corner to United.
* 90 min : First pieces of information suggest there will be 6 minutes of added time.
* 90 min : Vidic on target - Lloris saves from the corner!
* 90 min : Vidic on target again, Lennon on the post clears!
* 90 min : Cross comes in, Vidic heads it just over.

**5 MINUTES OF ADDED TIME.**

* 90+ min : All of you out there not watching the game - nail biting finish. One of them Spurs finishes.
* 90+ min : Two minutes of additional time have been played.
* 90+ min : Spurs concede a free kick at the corner of the pitch for hanging on to Januzaj. COME ON SPURS.
* 90+ min : Dealt with, same with the following pressure.
* 90+ min : Into the final minute of stoppage time!
* 90+ min : Long ball into the Spurs box, Lloris diving header to clear.
* 90+ min : This should be it... seconds away now...
* [](//#whistle) VICTORYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!

Wife: I think Moffat isn't just a fan of Doctor Who, he's obsessed to come up with these references from 40-50 years ago.

If that is the case then you'd think I won't be bullied. However that is wrong I am consistently blamed and bullied for one very small reason that I drive a car. 

I chose to drive as I think it is the most practical way of travelling across London. Public transport can't please everyone as you can't connect from every point to every other point. Cycling is far too dangerous. 

Cyclists want to ban HGVs. But the deliveries made by HGVs are essential for the world's economy unlike many trips by cycle which are just for fun or in the name of exercise. If you want to exercise what about using one of the perfectly good swimming pools. Swimming is enjoyed by everyone unlike cycling which is only liked by a few lunatics

Cyclists who cannot accept how dangerous it is are the biggest blamers of Decent motorists. They put themselves in danger by cutting in and out of traffic and going through red lights yet they always say it is the decent law abiding motorist who is at fault. 

We motorists have undergone extensive training and risk losing our license if we break the law. We also pay VED which doesn't have to be spent on roads but I'm sure roads are effectively paid for by VED. Yet cyclists who are minority and probably don't pay for roads demand that they get their on way how roads are designed. 

It is time for the Mayor of London and the Prime Minister to make a very difficult decision and ban cycling for the health and safety of everyone. At the very least VED should be able extended to bicycles (and low emission cars) and for cumplusory training for cyclists to be introduced.

I thought we played fairly well. Yeah the goal was totally a gift, but we took it and defended the lead. The statistics say 35% of the possession which is what we seem to be about at the moment, but we actually played some football in this match unlike the last few.

A few points:

* We still need to learn how to shoot. Albrighton and Delph had multiple chances that should've been put away.
* After a run of 4 defeats, we drew our last game and won this one. Hopefully December was just unfortunate.
* Benteke is playing a lot deeper than usual and it doesn't suit us much. Maybe he feels we need somebody there, but it needs to be a #10, not him. Towards the end he was playing further up again and that's where he was a big threat.
* We have a much better defense when Vlaar is playing, unquestionably. Shame he got a slight niggle, hopefully that's not serious.
* I'm glad Albrighton is back, he can definitely do a job for us. When Grealish comes back we have essentially the same on the other side, and with Gardner we have the same in the middle, blooding those 2 through slowly is essential. 
* May Gabby retire with us, he's a hero.

'' Hello *JonnySniper*

I'm sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

It's disappointing to hear that you feel this way.

BT Sport has a strong commitment to grass roots and non-league football in the UK. As well as broadcasting 30 matches from The Skrill Premier League this season, BT Sport have also televised matches from Brackley Town, Shortwood United, Wrexham, Gateshead and Cambridge United in the FA Cup so far this season.

On top of that, BT Sport’s magazine programmes have visited and filmed at Clapton, Hemel, Mildenhall, Hampton &amp; Richmond, Gloucester City, Dulwich Hamlet, and Kidderminster for feature programming around the FA Cup.

Thank you for taking the time to contact us.

Best wishes
BT Sport Team ''

But I think he mentions a considerable number of beliefs you'd hear the Doctor espouse (as well as a few he wouldn't), and it's a good read:

&gt; I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone, if possible, Jew, gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness -- not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another.
&gt; 
&gt; In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.
&gt; 
&gt; The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world -- millions of despairing men, women and little children -- victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say -- do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed -- the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people and so long as men die, liberty will never perish.
&gt; 
&gt; Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes -- men who despise you -- enslave you -- who regiment your lives -- tell you what to do -- what to think or what to feel! Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men -- machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate! Only the unloved hate -- the unloved and the unnatural!
&gt; 
&gt; Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the 17th Chapter of St. Luke it is written: ""the Kingdom of God is within man"" -- not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power -- the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.
&gt; 
&gt; Then, in the name of democracy, let us use that power! Let us all unite! Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth the future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie! They do not fulfill their promise; they never will. Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people! Now, let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.
&gt; 
&gt; Soldiers! In the name of democracy, let us all unite!
&gt; 
&gt; Hannah, can you hear me? Wherever you are, look up, Hannah. The clouds are lifting. The sun is breaking through. We are coming out of the darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world, a kindlier world, where men will rise above their hate, their greed and brutality. Look up, Hannah. The soul of man has been given wings, and at last he is beginning to fly.

http://www.cultbox.co.uk/news/headlines/8658-doctor-who-exec-promises-raw-different-direction-in-series-8#.Ur7JVwRE7rw.twitter

In regards to the show ""internally"", I believe it would be the regeration itself that could be the cause of this. The doctor received the new regenerations from a (supposed) Gallifrey in a pocket universe, and not from his own cycle. In a sense, this may have disrupted his own ""wiring"", or memories and actions.

As far as a realist point for Doctor Who, it's pretty clear that the line ""Do you know how to fly this thing?"" was made purely for dramatic effect at the time. What might be done with it in the future would either lay out to one of two things:

1) It was humour / drama that simply ends there

2) They use this to propel the doctor into this ""new era"", showing how much he has changed.

River.

If the 2 aforementioned events were ""resets"", she never would have met the Doctor to begin with. This is proven on the last episode of Matt Smiths. She first met the Doctor during Tenants era, before either of these events happened.  

If everything before BB2 had reset and the Doctor hadn't saved Gallifrey, then there would have been no scars of the cracks in the universe for the time lords to use to call out to the Doctor, no one would have went to trenzalore, the sect would never have broken off (which had to have happened during the first 300 years of him being on trenzalore due to the 11th and Tasha not talking about it until Clara comes back, 300 years later) and kidnapped River to stop him from going to trenzalore.

If both BB2 and the saving of Gallifrey hadn't happened none of the 11th Doctors adventures would have happened at all. Meaning Moffat knew what he was doing for the 50th and Matt's final episode when he first introduced River to the 10th Doctor.

Obviously the desired result in a game like Everton/Stoke is much more clear. 

I am partially conditioned to assume Man United will make a run in the spring perhaps surpassing the likes of Everton and Spurs to challenge for the top 4 based on recent history, alas United under Moyes could be, and hopefully is, much much different..  

There is also the immediate fact that Everton was ahead of us in points today, and I feel many Liverpool fans have been so caught up in how fantastic our team is doing, we failed to truly recognize that Everton is doing just as well (in Martinez's first year as well).  

Then there's Tottenham.  The fact that we beat them 5-0 at WHL gives us a huge advantage over them, and I've probably not considered legitimate rivals since that game.  But the fact remains that they have much better depth in their squad than us.   They don't have Suarez, or chemistry, but they have depth and that will play a factor. 

So my question is this: Which of these three teams do you view as our greatest threat for the 4th spot?

If Tennant had not wasted a regeneration due to vanity, Smith would have had one regeneration left.

He then is driven by hatred, becomes the Valeyard, and goes back in time to drag the Colin Baker Doctor to trial so that he can steal seven regenerations and keep the Tennant Doctor (who he blames for not existing in a normal manner) from existing.

My other theory is that after the 12th regeneration a Time Lord's body loses the ability to generate a body, and those with new life cycles have to pattern their regenerations on someone they have already seen.
