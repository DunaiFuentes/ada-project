I've mentioned a couple times how much I disliked The Waters of Mars, and the biggest reason is that I was kind of hoping to see how the Doctor would save the day without bringing the Reapers down on the entire universe. Instead, the Doctor's solution--get everyone in the Tardis and bring them back to earth, only to be reprimanded by the woman who was formerly pleading for his help. I thought it was sloppy writing of the worst kind. 

Now, I think the show has another chance to have the Doctor change a fixed point in time, and hopefully do it in a way that's clever, cool, and a little bit mad.

2. Probably more important and more interesting, and the reason why I watched the same 15 seconds of the episode over and over again: The writing in River's notebook. On one page, you have 

""22/04/11

But on the *other* page,* in different handwriting*, there's 

""Utah -&gt; Coordinates

So it's possible that River may have known the date and time from stories, like she says to Madame Kovarian. She might have even known that a spaceman was involved. 

But how on earth would she ever know that a little girl was involved?

In fact he's the fastest British junior of all time, faster even than Colin Jackson at junior level, and stands a real chance of competing at the Olympics for us next year now that he's been moved up to adults.

He's at Uni in Bristol and has to drive to Bath to train every day, sadly a junior turned adult hurdler doesn't make any money in sponsorship like the pros do but he's hoping to get there eventually. He spends more or less all of his cash on getting to and from training every single day.

He's been nominated by Spar (the Supermarket chain) for a Â£1000 award in their Outstanding Athlete category but needs votes. It's completely free and you just need to click on the ""vote"" button - there's no data capture.

I'm turning to Reddit in the hope he wins, it'd mean so much to him and will help his training so much. http://www.spar.co.uk/HealthandFitness/Athletics/Athletes/VoteforSPARStars.aspx (**Hes Andrew Pozzi, the vote box in the middle**)

This might get downvoted to hell, I don't know, but its worth a shot. If you've got brothers your proud of I guess you'd do the same.

TLDR; Younger brother is a team GB hurdler &amp; student, needs votes to win Â£1k to fund his training. No data capture etc when voting.

During the show he visited several parts of Nova Scotia, including the capitol city of Halifax.  Repeatedly during the episode he used phrases such as ""snow bound"", ""desolate"", and ""isolated"" to describe NS, and during the segment filmed in Halifax they didn't really show the city at all, just some run-down public housing visible from the bridge as he entered the city (Halifax is reached via a one of two bridges, both being approximately 100 metres tall therefore providing great views.  The bridge they used in the show was the one with the bad view, and they only showed the side with the run-down looking housing rather than the nice side with the basin and marinas).  Once they moved to Boston they showed it in a much better light.

Anyway, my question to you is this:  Is that really what many people from the UK think Nova Scotia is like?  Desolate, snow-bound, and run down?  I'm from Nova Scotia and was surprised at how it was represented on the show.  I'm not offended or anything, but just a little curious as to what people in the UK generally think this part of Canada (or Canada in general) is actually like.

Charging 5p per bag is not enough to make people carry crappy used bags around with them. So people will still be getting new bags each time they need one. So if the idea is to protect the environment, why not issue a decree requiring the use of biodegradable bags instead.

Well, I just finished the first one. Here it is, (Literally) hot off the printer -
[The Doctor - Here to help Badge.](http://i.imgur.com/5Uxls.jpg)

I'm at work(I made this on my Morning tea break in a bit of a rush) so I don't have my decent camera with me - thus the shitty iphone picture. However, once I get home, I'll take some proper photos with size comparisons and such. Also, I'm aware it's not 100% screen accurate - the Screen version has square corners, not rounded - but as I said, bit of a rush, I can/will do further ones without the rounded corners.

Also, it's a thermal sublimation print on hard plastic, about a millimeter thick(roughly 0.039 inches, for the Americans), and has a badge pin on the back, ready to be pinned onto one's shirt or suspenders.

So, what do you think?

EDIT - Thank you for all the Kind Responses! Yes, I will be selling them, I'll be setting up a storefront when I get home in a few hours(And after I take some better pictures), and I'll provide links for you once I have. I will be mailing them out from Australia, and it will probably be an Etsy Storefront, unless someone has any better suggestions.

EDIT TWO - If you Express an interest in buying one(or more, of course) in this thread, I will send you a private message when they are ready to purchase.

EDIT THREE - I should have everything in order and ready to go in less than 24 hours, just sorting out some small details to make sure it all goes well. 
Pricing is as follows - 
$5.50 AUD per badge
Shipping and handling within Australia is $2.10 per dozen badges.
Shipping and handling international - US and UK, that is - Is $3.50 if you order from one to six, and $6.20 from seven to 12. I can fit at most a dozen per bag, so if you're ordering more than that - highly unlikely I know, but still - contact me, we'll see what we can do.

I'm honestly still taking a bit of a financial loss, but frankly my dears, I don't give a damn, it's absolutely worth it to me. You guys have responded more than I ever dared hope - I honestly thought I'd get maybe two or three at most, but let's face it, I should have known the seemingly impossible is quite possible around The Doctor('s fans). 

You've more than made my day, you've made my whole week. You're all bloody champions, and I wish I could shake each and every one of you by the hand. Thank you, each and every one of you.

EDIT FOUR - 
[They're Now Available for sale at Etsy!](http://www.etsy.com/listing/82921130/doctor-who-im-here-to-help-badge)
I've messaged everyone who registered an interest in them, but in case I missed you, or you've come across the thread since there, There's the storefront for you.

I have a bunch listed on there currently, but if it runs out, I'll just list more ASAP. If you're ordering more than one, Contact me.

I just moved into some privately rented student halls and TV licencing is already hot on the case.

I do not own a TV.

There is a hall with a shared living room/kitchen. A letter has arrived addressed to ""The Occupier - Communal Areas"" which is apparently the final warning, an enforcement officer is en-route etc. etc.

In the shared area there is a TV, its not mine, I think it belongs to one of the other tenants, I don't even know his name and he's almost never in, in fact I've never actually met him.

Do I understand from this letter that we are expected to have a licence for the kitchen/living area as well as for the individual rooms?

If so, and this licencing guy does come around and sees this telly can it in any way come back onto me, even though I don't own or use it?

I'll be in the UK for a month from early December through the New Year, and will be be spending most of my time in Edinburgh and London, but hope to see much of what's in between (Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, etc) as well. Luckily I'll be staying with my English friend a good chunk of the time, but while I'm alone I hope to make friends and avoid making an ass of myself!

Is the Doctor the king and River the Queen? Or is it Amy and Rory. Will the king (Doctor) sacrifice himself before the queen to end the game? Would this be to protect the rest of the pieces? The Doctor isnt big on sacrificing people others consider [pawns](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sacrifice_%28chess%29). It would appear to be a game he can't win as we've already seen him shot. Kobayashi Maru? Madame Kevorkian clearly has been playing 'the long game' with the Doctor.

Even though the Doctor is as witty as ever the episodes themselves and the locations always seem underprepared and hollow. Dr. Who has always been about these crazy situations that the Doctor and his companions get roped into and (usually) the fun they have on the journey.

 Even looking at last season there are episodes were the threat/villain play second Fidel to the characters they meet (e.g Vincent Van Gough).

Every episode in season 6 has been extremely draining emotionally, which can be a bad thing when it's EVERY episode that something dramatic/sad happens. 

In the impossible planet the doctor gets shot and so does the child in the astronaught suit, the whole opening of the first episode felt so in-Who. The funeral for the Doctor seemed extremely silly and the idea of the Doctor doing all these crazy things seems exactly like the doctor at the end of season 4, which isn't a good thing. 

 in the pirate episode the pirates are extremely cliche and the story is flat and attempts to pull at the viewers heart strings with the father son bond, there is barely any setting and the twist is rather odd.

 in the Dictors Wife, although my favorite episode the episode is still dark as Amy sees who she thinks is Rory rot away, which again just blends in with the rest of the season. Also as much as I liked House he felt extremely underdeveloped.

 the flesh episodes seem disjointed and again emotionally overbearing, although I enjoyed the two doctors everything else is so over the top.

 a good man goes to war is serious, dark and a tad rushed. Although it will hopefully be explained in the last episode I felt Demon's Run needed a lot more backstory, I think it's better to inform the viewer of some back story and let them guess what will/is happening rather then just shoving the idea down the viewers throats.

 let's kill Hitler again was disjointed, there was barely any interaction with the location they were at (which would have been really interesting, although considering how Hitler had a British accent I'm not so sure) and Riversong's 'bad side' was incredibly over played as her transformation of character by the end of the episode was blatantly obvious. 

Then in Night Terrors not only was the kid incredibly annoying but nothing made much sense, everything felt inserted in the dollhouse just because they looked cool. 

The Girl Who Waited was a good episode, however the planet was set up with barely 30 seconds of dialogue and is barely mentioned throughout the episode, I think I preferred Amy when she was interacting with the worlds the doctor was showing her, not overshadowing them and being the set piece, I just don't think she's interesting enough.

The God Complex was all style and no substance, this time the villain was completely overshadowed by Amy, Rory and the Doctor which is disappointing considering how the premise had considerable potential.

And finally Closing Time was an absolute mess, the Doctor and Craig's interactions didn't feel as lively as they were the first time around and the Cybermem were so completely forgotten that the episode may have been better off without them.

Ok so I said I wasn't going to complain but obviously I did, I came into this season expecting to love every minute of it, but unfortunately that's not the case. I think this series has been way too serious, Doctor Who is not a serious show, even during the most serious/sad moments there has been humor and hope, not in this series though. 

The doctor seems bi-polar as his mood is constantly changing each episode, I love Matt Smith but he's quickly entering David Rennant at the end if season 4 territory, especially in the latest episode.

Rory and Amy are good and enjoyable characters they really shouldn't be what the series is focussing on, the main villains of the show seem poorly set up, The Silence are already defeated (as we can tell from episode 2) and eye patch lady (her name escapes me) is completely forgettable.

I think what I'm trying to say is that I prefer Dr. Who as a fun and not so serious show, although I appreciate what's being attempted I don't want it to become like Lost, Doctor Who is it's own celebrated thing, leave it be I say.

Edit: god dammit, after spell checking this incredibly long rant on my iPhone I of course miss the one mistake I can't correct!!

I am going to order a new printer (inkjet) and wanted to ask you about what kinds you use that you prefer.

The requirements are that it be fairly fast (I will be printing ~300 A4 partial colour docs at a time, not a lot of colour), and that ink is not obscenely expensive, and that it is separate black.

A multifunction device with a scanner would be the ideal, and currently I am looking at a Canon that seems to tick most of the boxes.

If it could do 300 prints in a couple of hours that would be sufficient for my needs.

I am getting it bought for me, so whilst price is important I am more likely to go for something a bit 'better' if it will ultimately save money in the long term than I perhaps would if buying somethings for myself.

Sorry for the rough quality.  My only 'camera' is my iPad.

Overall, the quality of the parts themselves are okay.  It is made of Zinc, so it is light, but has enough weight to feel 'realistic'.  The buttons to open the watch and turn on the light work great.  The detailing on the outside and the inside are magnificent(or should I say Fantastic!) I am unsure as to whether the 'glass screen' is really glass or something similar.  

I only have one real issue with the thing.  The time is three hours behind, and for the life of me, I can't figure out how to get it set right.  I looked online at how to set other watch times, and this one is not like any other.  The twist dial at the top is fake, and just spins continually.  If anyone has any way to change the time on this thing, it'd be really helpful.

So, I guess what I'd say is this:  If you are a collector of Doctor Who Merchandise and really want to carry around a Pocket Watch, then by all means, get it.  However, there is a chance that the time will be off and potentially unchangeable.  

I hope this helps!

TL;DR Decent watch with time settings off.

Edit:  By pulling up on the twist dial, you can change the time.  Thank you for informing me.  This is my first pocket watch.

No doppelgangers, crazy twist, or any of that non-sense.(Unless you count the crazy twist as there not being any twist and it was a legit death)  Either way, it's written in time.  The Doctor dies.  We saw him burn.  Just going to be straight up: The Doctor really dies.  

The finale is going to show us what the doctor did before he died(He was older when he showed up in the America episode.  Also note that the doctor does lie, and most likely was lying about his age.  I see that being more so played off as ""Just for fun doctor character development...a jest.  The doctor was uneasy when we saw him in the America episode.  He knows he is about to die and is Understandable.  Much like a fear of clowns.   The focus of the last episode of this season is going to be what the doctor was doing when we didnt see him. (We were with the present...er, our present, er...the doctor that doesnt know he is going to die.)  Stuff goes down and we will all get that **ZOMG, IT ALL COMES TOGETHER SPLOSION!** that I personally love so much.

But heres the kicker...I think the big, major, twist will have to deal with Amy choosing to be the girl who waited or not to be the girl who waited.  

They put a lot of emphasis on this whole waiting thing for her.

* *Just curious, anyone else pissed that Amy was a baby about having to wait 30ish years while Rory was a man(or plastic thing but still more a man because he had to be type thing) and waited 2k years?*
Either way, off topic...

This, I feel, is going to be the focus.  This is why the episode ""Amys Choice"" was said to be so damn important.  Only this time her character will have to make that choice while being portrayed by the more enjoyable and talented child actress.(What is that cute kids name anyway?)  The choice she will have to make will be if she chooses to spend her childhood waiting for the doctor or if she moves on.

The Doctor went through all of this in the episode about faith in that werid 80's hotel.  He was telling her to move on...but more so telling himself to move on.  She is not that little girl anymore, nor should she ever have been that little girl waiting.  But thats not up to the doctor.  Nah, that would be too easy.  Thats up to Amy.  Im sure she decides to wait anyways.  More timey whimey, a mess of laughs are sure to ensue...and we will have one hell of an episode.

Oh...and...


River sits in jail out of the guilt that she actually does go through with killing the doctor even though it doesn't even matter.  Its her guilt that weighs her down. 

Doctor Who, for me, is fun in that you always get what you least expect.  This is honestly what I least expect and im sure ill get moffucked and none of this is anywhere close.

Either way, discuss!

Perhaps you can help. 

* When the Flesh are made, are they made with clothes and all? And if they are, does that include devices such as the Sonic Screw driver? And if it does include that, then why were the doctors passing the screwdriver back and forth? If it doesn't include devices, I can understand the sharing, but then this is where I lose the continuity.
 
* When one of the Doctors goes to look for Rory during ""The Almost People"", against Amy's wishes (as she believes he is the Flesh Doctor) the Doctor who stays behind (who is *really* the Flesh doctor) gives the other doctor his sonic. 

* So, we have Stayed Behind Doctor (Flesh Doctor) Without the sonic, and Find Rory Doctor (Real Doctor) with the sonic. Okay. Later on when Rory and Jennifer trick the (Flesh)Doctor, Amy and the other humans into the room with the acid, The (Flesh)Doctor has a sonic in that room. The (Real)Doctor who went to find Rory (and was knocked out) also has a sonic, we see him use it, and we see it by his head when he comes to with the gangers standing over him.
 
* Eventually, they all meet up again when most of the gangers have a change of heart, and both Doctors, and the humans and gangers are running from the evil Jennifer ganger. Toward the VERY end, when we find out who's who with the Doctor's, the (Real)Doctor throws a Sonic at the (Flesh)Doctor who is holding the door shut  then he, Amy and Rory run into the TARDIS, and escape. The (Flesh)Doctor uses his sonic to disintegrate Evil Jennifer.
 
* Meanwhile, the Doctor uses HIS sonic to dissolve Flesh Amy. Does any of this make sense?
I wonder if there are THREE doctors running around. I also want to point out that when Rory finds Amy and the Doctor (and this is Flesh Doctor we're talking about) they run off after Rory to the crypt, the doctor watches for a moment, staring after them, then he follows slowly, looking behind him once more before he runs off.

From what I saw, the doctors passed their Sonic back and forth twice, but both had one, simultaneously throughout the episode.

I see that in the discussion thread for the episode, it was [mentioned briefly](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/hmdex/the_almost_people_discussion_thread_spoilers/c1wjaqo), so other people HAVE noticed this continuity ...error (for lack of a better word).

I think this makes a lot of sense, but I may be missing details, so feel free to offer corrections.

The Silence and Mme Kovarian et al. are not actually on the same side. The Silence are *agents provocateurs* manipulating the strings (as we know they did on Earth) in order to get what they want: control of the universe.

The Silence, we now know are a religious order who believe ""Silence will fall when the Question is answered."" What Question? The oldest Question in the universe: Who kills the Doctor (or alternately, who kills the last of the Time Lords)? When this question is answered, only on the death of the Doctor, silence falls (lack of enforcement of Time Laws) and chaos erupts. The Silence then fall (in a predatory sense) and take over the Time Lords' traditional roll and remake history in their own interests using the Time Travel technology they've developed. 

So that's the desired end result. Now for the explanation of the season.

The Doctor and his companions (who are acting really weird) travel through time and space, kicking the Silence off of Earth. He becomes aware of Amy's weird quantum pregnancy, eventually explained by the Flesh Amy. He travels to Demon's Run to rescue her and the baby, using an army of traditional bad guys to 'defeat' Mme Kovarian, who nonetheless escapes with baby Melody.

Here's where it gets weird: Demon's Run is actually proof of what the Silence has been telling Kovarian et al.: The Doctor is evil. See how he fights alongside bad guys? He *must* be stopped. 

The eyepatches are a way of allowing people to remember the Silence and everyone who wears them is fighting *against* the Doctor in the final episode. Yup, that means River, Amy and Rory are against the Doctor and wanting to kill him, now believing (through Silence opinion poisoning) that he has gone rogue and must be stopped.

The Doctor, though, has now learned of his death and takes steps to prevent it from being final via the Two Streams facility (200 years older, anyone?). He can now visit Craig in *Closing Time*, pick up invitations to send to his other self and younger companions, then go to Lake Silencio to his own death. The invitations, however, launch the companions into their fight against the Silence, ultimately banishing them from Earth and stopping them from gaining access to TARDIS-like equipment. 

Kovarian is no longer poisoned against the Doctor, does not kidnap Melody, and the Pond-Williams get to raise their child, who still turns into the River Song we know eventually.

I love DW.

But I have a terrible feeling that tonight's finale is going to suck. Since the show resumed with ""Let's Kill Hitler"" we haven't really learned anything new about this season's ""elephant in the room"". Little snippets here and there maybe, but for the most part nothing new. I have a feeling tonight's episode is going to be allot of ridiculous but lazy storytelling over a less than 60 minute period of time, with the last five minutes being when we, as fans, all collectively figure out what's going on. 

This is just my opinion of course, but I feel like that's been the formula for most (not all) of this season's episodes. I realize that DW was always about ridiculous stories and premises, and that one of the new series merits is it's faster pace. But at least with classic DW, they told you the whole story, even if it was stretched out over four ""to be continued"" episodes. Even if the story as a whole wasn't always thrilling, it progressed at a rate that the audience felt comfortable with. I feel like some of the new stories are trying to be that kind of epic, but they're condensing them into just two-parters, and the rest of the season is a bunch of unrelated and medicore story-telling. 

I was a huge fan of LOST. Say what you want about the show or the finale, but the writers took time to develop the story and the characters to the last detail. I wish Moffat and other other writers of the show would take some of that energy and put it in the new series.

So I expect that tonight's finale will feel ""off"". Hopefully I'm wrong and it's awesome.

I've not had a problem following the show, although I can understand why some may find it confusing. The problem I have is that for those that truly understand it, the show becomes completely ridiculous and ridden with plot holes, deus ex machina and general bad writing.

Here are some observations on tonights episode.

-The Doctor being saddened by the phone call that his old friend died is baffling. This is a man who travels in a box through time and knows more than anyone else that people die. There is no reason that he would be surprised by the death of his friend of natural causes, probably thousands of years before the moment of time he then inhabited. He would've been at the man's deathbed. Probably far earlier on in his life.


-The scene where London returns to its normal state, is again, completely ridiculous and I hope I don't have to explain why.


-Can moffat not write a season finale without multiple resettings of reality?


-The idea of people being able to remember their experiences in an aborted timeline annoys me to no end. It would never have happened in old who or even RTD who. Moffat seems to want to turn the show into a Fantasy Soap Opera Where Miracles Happen In Space. He's clearly succeeded.


-The pacing is horrifying. Just like this and his previous finale, the episode should have been split into two parts. Instead we got an episode where you're barely given a moment to explore each of the multiple twists more seriously.


-I don't even know the name of the woman with the odin's patch. Although googling reveals it to be Lady Kovarian. What a terrible antagonist she was. Her motives were never explained and her character was nothing more than a cardboard cut out used to advance the plot.


-The Silence had such great potential but they too have become walking jokes. They just look stupid when they shape themselves to shoot lightning out of their hands.


-The twist where it was revealed the Doctor survived in the tiny spaceship disguised as himself was so obvious that I expected the ship's reintroduction during the episode to be a red herring.


-It was never explained why River was able to resist the suit which had been controlling her probably for months to get her to the lake. Again, perhaps a double episode could'be explored it further, although the reasoning behind it would probably have been the usual ""power of love"" hogwash.



______________________________________________________________________________________________

I could go on and on, but quite frankly I can't be bothered to. Moffat seems to be unable to close a season without increasing the abstractness of the plot tenfold to accommodate his attempts at an arc. To his credit though, at least the Screwdriver wasn't overused today.


I had defended him this season, but in the past few weeks I've become increasingly dismayed. The problem isn't that the show is too confusing. It's that it's too ridiculous.

It just didn't make sense! The Dr, what, tricked time itself by hiding in a robot?! Sure, he was in the robot so he got shot at, but he didn't die, did he? Surely if it was that easy, ""fixed points"" mean nothing.

PLUS, we saw the robot try and regenerate, which presumably we're supposed to conveniently forget, or assume was a special effect from the robot. Hmmmm.

It's cheating, pure and simple. I love Steven Moffat normally, but it seems that this time he had written himself into an impossible situation.

Except he didn't.

An this is where it gets really annoying. Because we were given another way of copying the Dr. earlier in the series; a way that would have worked perfectly.

I'm talking about Gangers. Gangers were exact copies, including memories and everything. In fact, a big deal was made about the fact that the Dr. Ganger in that episode *was* the Dr. just as much as the original. If a Ganger was used *it would have been the Dr. dying*, no cheating.

And wouldn't it have been a beautiful irony, the Dr. using The Silence's own trick against them? Perfect.

----------------------------
River kills a man who is ""a good man, and a hero to many,"" whom she says is ""the best I've ever known."" Who is this man? some say it is the DOctor.  However, throughout the course of both seasons, he commits genocids, puth amy through living through an evil part of his psyche, abandons Amy yo a quarantien (sort of), and admits his vainity. while not the worst, he is ceartainly not the best.

furthermore, to be place in a high security prision, River would have to kill a prominent and officia; ;leader, especiallly if iyt is only one man.  Octavian says ""you don't want to know, sit.  you really don't!"" if this man is not the doctor, it is someone who is close to him.

The curch, who BTW is activle hunting down the doctor bears the symool ((he drew the omega symbol here)), which is an omega symbol.  THe founder of Time Travel amoung time lords is called omega.  He is heralded as a hero, and although he had a few unorthodox plans, he never attempted to take a life.  He only sought his arguably rightful place as leader of the Time lords, understandable especially considering he is sontained inan antimatter universe.  Note also that in the 51st centure, then most of this takes place, humans have access to time travel.

Omega is known for his will, sustaining himself through only this.  It is how he attained any of his powers.

Buthow is he a good man? just wait.

We're going to talk about Rory.  Rory Williams is extremely devoted to Amy.  His family is Unknown.  He is the Father of Rive, a nurse, and is constantly attending to those in need.  He is a good man.

So is it Omega or Rory? Yes.  Whay? Here.  Of all non-Time lords, only ROry does not flip out ofer the internal size of the TARDIS.  only rory maintains his personality though will amoung the centurions.  River is exactly half-specific.  Nit only is it EXACTLY half, but it is also TIME LORD as opposed to something random.  ROry mamages through thr hotel without findinf his room.  All others did, whether they started ""parising him"" or not.  Older amy is somewhatof a paradox.   She would  only exist if Rory failed.  Note the disease that kills Time Lords.

Aditionally Rory notices an Exit in thr hotel.  As  He is referred to, on a good man goes to war, you beginto think he is the doctor, but you realize it is rory.

Omega was bitter.  He had been betrayed by a friend and abandoned by all his family and prople.  Say he finally escaped.  SAy he made himself ambigouous as only a genu=ious of his caliber could.  Say he finds someone  that makes him better. Say rory has a pocket watch with his last initial.  ""W"" is an alternate symbol for omega.


LASTly, I provide a counter-theory to River being imprisioned fo rkilling the Doctor.  An otginizai=tion affiliated woth thouse that did (the church) is actively hunting her.  In a trailer you see River with an eye patch.  Is it river disguised as Kovarian? or vide versa? does river kill the doctor?

-------------------

Is the doctor done for? at 1103 he is exactly 200 years older than the first time he met river.  that is ample time to  replace a screwdriver and perhaps add thought-mail features hint-hint data ghost.

Canton knows more than he says.  And he brought a pickup.  the 1103-year old doctor's TARDIS is missing (or cloaked). It is ine of the few things that stabalize a Ganger body. And ""Rover's"" screwdrover can store consciousness

People want him dead        
Piece that together

p.s. river as of time of the angels (the only time other than silence in the library to be out of prison) has seen multiple faces of the doctor.  Enough to confise her.


--------------------

---------------------

So, guys.  is he insane? are these theorys just babble?

I typed it as fast as I could and this is what he wrote on thepaper he gave me.

A thing he left out is that in the diner at the beginning of season 6, River has been on an adventuure with the Doctor (1103) that he doesn't remember.  If he dies later in the episode, how does that work?

.

Yeah... I don' know... what do you think.

(sorry for the atricious typing and the way he writes)

In *A Good Man Goes to War,* River arrives to her stormcage after a birthday date with The Doctor (with Stevie Wonder as a third wheel). Are we to assume that The Doctor occasionally takes River out? When did he do it? I'm guessing that Rory and Amy weren't there (or were they?). He could have done it after *A Good Man Goes to War* instead of looking for baby River but that is really weird.

He has already displayed incredible abilities; lived 2000 years without losing his mind (as Timelords often do), defended Amy and the Doctor despite a million volts pulsing through his eyeball, as well as other feats.  And the fact that his number of deaths ranks up there with a Timelord is very Moffaty if you ask me.

We know very little about him or his history. Other than that he has no faith in anything (The God Complex), all we know is that he is an incredible guy, *a good man* in fact.

River is imprisoned for killing a good man, by the church, [who carry the symbol of Omega](http://www.malevolentia.com/riversong.png). Now, the Doctor is, as this series has continually hammered home, a morally ambiguous man, and merely a rogue Time Lord; why would the church care about his murder? Omega created time travel with Rassilon, he is ""the Timelords' greatest hero"". 'Doctor *who*? I'm Omega, bitch.'

And for me, the clincher; **he impregnated Amy with a baby Timelord.** 


EDIT; If River Song can go back in time, track down Amy and become her best friend Mels, then so could Omega track down the Doctor's companion, and become her husband.

His motivation for so serruptitiously working his way into Amy's life? To put an end to the Doctor dragging the name of the once glorious Timelords through the mud perhaps?

This is something that's been bothering me since The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon. It seems like the whole idea of forgetting about the Silents when you don't see them is handled very sloppily. At a few times, it makes sense. Like when the Doctor and Churchill were running from the Silents but keep forgetting that it was happening. But other times, it seems that the writers forget that a character should have no idea what a Silent even is.

For example, after the Doctor and Amy take off their eyepatches in the finale, there's absolutely no indication that they've forgotten anything at all. They act as though the still know why they have to run, what's at stake, who's chasing them, and why they're there in the first place. In fact no one in the episode ever exhibited signs of forgetting anything after taking off the eyepatch, which kind of weakened the objects' strength in the plot.

Similarly, there was never an explanation given for how, between the two premiere episodes, the Doctor and the gang managed to figure out that they were fighting anyone. What was it that let them suddenly remember that there was anything going on? And in Day of the Moon, it seemed the plan was very intricate and consistent, given the fact that they shouldn't remember anything other than *maybe* the somehow-established idea that they were fighting *something*.

I just feel as though the concept of the Silents is *fascinating*, and they could be a great enemy, but after an initial exposition on their special ability, they just become regular creepy looking monsters who shoot lightning.

And while I'm complaining, why didn't the Doctor just tell River that he was a Tesselecta earlier?

People argued, saying I would grow to like/love her, and bade me post again concerning my feelings for her once I finished her episodes.

Well, I did.  And I still don't like her.  The elements that made me dislike her from the first episode were muted (as some said they would be) but still there enough to annoy me.

Who is River? Everyone suspected she was the Doctor's wife from as far back as Silence in the Library and it turns out that, yes, that's what she was. Her being Amy and Rory's daughter was also the most common theory ever since Amy was revealed to be pregnant.

Who did River kill to end up in Stormcage? Again, the most obvious answer ended up being correct.

How did the Doctor survive his death? The details were a bit different (a robot instead of a ganger) but the idea of him using a decoy was pretty much the first thing to be considered.

The Question hidden in plain sight? Did anyone *not* consider ""Doctor Who?"" as a strong possibility?

What it essentially purports is that original series script editor Andrew Cartmel, seeking to recreate the mystery of the Doctor's origins, began a lengthy writerly quest now called ""The Cartmel Masterplan"" in the late 1980s.

The plan's goal was to establish the character of The Other, a mystery-shrouded figure from Gallifrey's distant past who, rumor and legend have it, was there at the beginning with Rassilon and Omega and, perhaps, witnessed the creation of the black hole that caused Oemga's apparent death. As it's been theorized that Rassilon purposefully misled Omega about the experiment's safety, it's reasonable to assume that as his lust for power grew, The Other might have fallen prey to his scheming as well--Who novels suggest he threw himself into Time Lord-creating Looms to evade Rassilon.

While the show was cancelled before all but the barest hints of this mystery could be revealed, novelists continued the idea in various series, contending that the Doctor may well represent the genetic reincarnation of this legendary figure, that Susan may have been the effectively immortal, naturally born granddaughter of The Other, and more.

Consider this in light of the curious usage of the Greek omega symbol briefly glimpsed in Moffat's run of DW--it appears to be the official insignia of the clerics who ""handled"" River Song during the Byzantium mission and of the holy fighters allied with Kovarian during ""A Good Man Goes to War."" 

Previous theories linked them to the old villain Omega, who well could have survived the Doctor's Time Lock of the Time Lords by bent of his expulsion from the normal-matter universe. The pocket universe shown in ""The Doctor's Wife"" suggests that the New Who universe can still support such extra-planar places, further setting the stage for a return of Omega, giving the Doctor a new, credible Time Lord threat, and giving the Silence religion the perfect quasi-divine figurehead to worship (who would surely have the power to blow up the TARDIS in the Season 5 finale).

Such a foe would certainly want the Doctor dead, and if the Doctor truly was ""the Other"" present at the birth of the Time Lord race, his knowledge and memories could gravely threaten Omega. And who is to say that ""The Other"" was innocent of the same failings that damned Omega and Rassilon in that ancient incarnation? He might truly be a threat to universal stability for all we know.

Has Moffat reached back into the depths of unaired history to finally answer the question of ""Doctor who?"", and will we see the resurrection of a legendary Time Lord foe in the process? Almost certainly not, but it's fun to consider!",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,A Theory Encompassing Tonight's Finale and a Surprising Piece of Lost Lore [Spoilers for S06E13),176,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/ky20h/a_theory_encompassing_tonights_finale_and_a/

After watching this final episode I feel like they shot this great, 1st, cliffhanger episode then just dragged me along all season before quickly putting random pieces together to make everything fit.  It looks like the plan for season 5 and season 6 was, ""lets just create a no win situation then make the entire time stream and universe reset at the end of the season"".  It's  bullshit.

The thing that bothers me most is the fact that we all knew the doctor wasn't going to really die.  This made the first episode a great cliffhanger because we all were going to figure out what he needed to do to survive this scenario.  The threw us all over the place with random crap like rubik's cubes, hats and bow-ties then just patched it all up with a dumb ending that made everything work.  

I miss David Tenant.  I also miss episodes that do not revolve around a married couple that the doctor cares about more than anything else he's seen in his 900+ years of life.

Also, how is there going to be a thirteenth or fourteenth Doctor?  We know that the show won't end, at least not long enough for there not to be these doctors.  

Time Lords only have 12 regenerations?        
I guess that it could help when River gave him all her regenerations.       
Or he could be ganger-ified combined wth the modifed screwdriver from Silence in the Library that can hold consciousness.      
Or Omega who is Rory will take the form of the Doctor and also his consciousness and become the Doctor with no trace of Omega or Rory in him.

I don't know.  Dumb theories.

The Silence are the new Time Lords since the Time Lords have been wiped out.

Things about 11th that are like the 1st.

1. A ""married"" couple in the Tardis (Ian and Barbra / Amy and Rory)
2. The cube in The Doctor's Wife.
3. Really pushing the idea that he stole the TARDIS and began running in The Doctor's Wife.
4. That he's not the only creature capable of not only time travel, but understanding time. Susan could only think in 5 dimensions when asked to solve simple math problems, and River is very much the same way. Susan in class and Mels in class.
5. In the Almost People(or rebel flesh), when Flesh Dr runs through the past regenerations.
6. The Doctors library card with the 1st Dr's picture
7. The notebook that the Dr. [spoiler](/s ""pulls out when talking to Dorium(sp via mystache_) is a throw back to the 1st Doctor's notebook that Susan says 'He writes everything down in'. So yes, he's been keeping a TARDIS journal too. Since 1963."")

My thought is that this leads us to the 50th anniversary year, where the new show comes back around and integrates alot of original concepts of the original show.

River is born way off in whatever time, and gets sent back to America in the 1960s. We then see her regenerate in an alley in 1969. The next we see of her is as Mels, Rory and Amy's childhood friend. Rory and Amy are in their early 20s in 2010. 

Therefore, River would have had to regenerate around 1990 (give or take a couple years) into a child to have had grown up alongside Amy and Rory. This leaves a 20ish year gap between 1969 and ~1990. Therefore, there must have been a regeneration of River's that we don't know about in this time frame.

Alternatively:  
Rory's employee badge in The Eleventh Hour said that it was issued in 1996 in an episode where the majority of the action takes place in 2008(?). If those two are 20ish around 2008, that means that badge would have had to been issued when Rory was a child. 

However, the 1996 date *would* make sense if Amy and Rory were born in the 70s. That way, freshly regenerated River could have grown up with them. As for the times they specifically mentioned the dates, uh.. *Wibbly wobbly, timey wimey*. 

Or:  
Everything I just said was wrong. The badge really was just a production mistake, and child River time travelled to ~1990.

TL;DR: There's a bit of a gap in River's timeline as it was displayed in series 5 and 6. Either River has a hidden regeneration, timelines are all wibbly, or I'm completely wrong about everything I just said up there and it's all explained as time travel + a production mistake.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"A discussion on one Ms. River Song.

This would mean he's known what that occurrence would be.  Just not the exact form of it or when it would happen.

So I was a bit disappointed by the finale. I now wonder a lot if my disappointment comes from being on Reddit so much. (not because of you guys)

After watching TWoRS, it turns out that all of our bonkers (and often times brilliant and apt) theories have been mostly wrong. Except for the obvious ones. (while it was kind of cool, I did facepalm when the question really was *Doctor Who?*)

I've reached the conclusion that no episode will live up to the expectations created by all the hype and speculations of Reddit. I should be more careful how much time I spend here. It really does affect the way I watch DW and I don't know if it's for the better (more analytical thinking of the episodes) or worse (more critical).

Also that Moffat writes predictable and somewhat fanfiction-y plots. Honestly, making River Amy's *daughter*? It's cool but when I first got spoiled on that one I thought *Wow that's rather soap opera-y*. BUT, the way he tells his stories makes them shocking, unexpected, and mind-blowing. He's like RTD but better at keeping us guessing, but IMO not at arc making. He's also my favorite writer, don't get me wrong.

Moffat is a guy who knows how to keep things moving and keep us entertained. But in comparison to RTD era, not as much heart. I don't think this is the ""decline"" of DW or anything. I consider it just another era and shift in DW's style. Each era has its strengths and weaknesses.

After I watched TWoRS I went and saw The Doctor's Daughter. What a great episode- and I hadn't remembered it that way. When Martha grieved for that Hath, her grief was *tangible*. I really felt for her. It's something I don't get often with Moffat's stories.

More than The Doctor's death being a trick - I can accept that the fixed point is actually the perception of his death and the reason is that a fixed point is fixed because it affects time travelers. Great explanation btw. I can somewhat accept that the tesselecta made a pretty light display to mimic the regeneration energy. I'm not entirely clear on the tesselecta being in the alternate timivese with The Doctor inside, but I can buy that one too.

My question is: Why River? If the astronaut suit was in control the entire time, why, why, why would the silence need to raise a psychopath to be in it, one who would meet The Doctor, who could possibly be compromised (as they would see it), the only one who could possibly mess things up by being in *the most crucial* point in time and space? If the suit had to have someone in it, why did they need someone like a Time Lord at all? Why not madam Kevorian herself? Why wait all this time and go through all the trouble of kidnapping someone close to The Doctor thereby bringing his attention on the whole plot? Did the astronaut suit require a Time Lord-esque pilot? But River has lost all of her regenerability in LKH, right? Did they need a drained Time Lord/Human hybrid in stormcage for some reason?

I'm really having trouble hand-waiving that one away, like I do for so many of the odd plot points in the other episodes. Maybe because I got more invested in the story arc.

No idea about the eighth Doctor.

But therein lies the problem: Eccleston's ninth Doctor was 900 (so we can assume something happened or he was lying), Tennant was 903 and Smith is currently 909, and then 1107, which, uh, actually broke the argument I was originally going to make here.

That implies that Eccleston and Tennant lived shockingly short lives, so unless it's meant to be an arbitrary number, if we follow the canon of the new series, there were 8 doctors in 900 years and then three in 9 years.

* It would also explain why a crack in time would open up in her wall, do to the paradox of being her own grandmother.

* It would also explain why she is able to remember the time shifts , and why the Doctor was so drawn to her. 

* Also this may explain why she grew up away from her parents, and why both River and the Doctor didn't know who she was, as she grew up in the middle of both of their timelines so neither was aware of her.

* It would explain how River ended up with Timelord DNA

* As Amy and Rory missed out on river's childhood, also the Doctor and River missed out on Amy's. This may have been done to protect her.

To be fair, it's natural that they take time off to film for the newer *Who*. Still, that doesn't mean we have to go without. There's around 30 years of *Doctor Who* to be explored. Let's face it: *DW* has a rich, vivid history, and an immense story.

What I want to do is, starting Friday, begin from the literal beginning. William Hartnell, the first, the beginning, was the first Doctor to grace the screens in 1963. I say we start from the beginning, and come forward. Way I see it, there's enough of the show to carry us from now to Christmas, and then onwards up until Series 7 begins.

I'd suggest using [Crossing the Whoniverse](http://www.crossingthewhoniverse.com/), which has almost everything *Doctor Who*, including *SJA*, *TW*, and *K9*. Every Friday and Saturday, we could come together, discuss what we've seen, see how it matches up to the new Series. Who knows? It might give us hints and tips as to what's coming in the future (for us, at least).

All future depictions of the 11th Doctor take place, therefore, out of sequence and during the 200 year interim, and next series' grand showdown between Matt Smith's Doctor and the Silence would have been one between the 11th Doctor and the conspiracy that the 12th Doctor infiltrated (started?), the latter playing a game of his own with himself.

I'm imagining the following could've-been exchange from next year::

Amy: Doctor, is that really you?

12th Doctor [w/ the creepy, hissing Silence voice]: Of course, Amelia. Why do you think the Silence are so fashionable?


And then in the climax of the 50th anniversary stuff, 11 can finally go to his doom, and the Silence Doctor can regenerate into 13, both departing from the same epic moment.

If i'm right 6x13 was the 86th Episode of the rebooted series. This accounts for the 78 episodes of series 1-6. Then also you have the 4 specials in between Series 4 and 5 and then also the 4 Christmas Specials. Coming in at 86 episodes. Now if you take this years Christmas Special and also the 13 episodes of Series 7. This makes 7x13 the 100th episode. Also if you look at the current theory that Series 7 is going to be split. Half in autumn 2012 and the second half in early 2013. This means that 7x13 would also air on the 50th Anniversary of the show.
I don't know how true it is, but it does explain some of the BBC's actions in splitting the series. I made a longer post in my [Doctor Who blog](http://jeddkenobi.wordpress.com/2011/10/02/doctor-who-7x13-100th-episode-and-50th-anniversary/). This is also my first submission to Reddit so i'm hoping I got this right.

I'm trying to break into the UK IT business (most likely as a helpdesk technician or possibly a junior admin, if anyone would have me :D) down in the South West.

I've tried applying for a few jobs, but I rarely hear anything back. I've worked for some time as a freelance sound engineer (I even have a BA in Music Technology), and in order to 'build my part', i've taken on working with AV companies as their IT support guy - sorting out office computers, installing and taking down temporary networks at conferences, etc etc. I've also worked in the past as a helpdesk tech for the arts department at my university, and am currently self-studying for a CCNA.

I'm wondering if the lack of responses might have something to do with my CV; it's been a few years since I was in school, and no doubt the format for a CV and covering letter has changed somewhat. I'm not sure how much I should emphasise my degree - it came with honours, and it obviously shows I have the ability to get an honours degree, but it's in a nearly completely unrelated subject. My other qualifications consist of GCSEs, some A2 Levels, and a couple of miscellaneous awards. I've been looking around to get some ideas and opinions on what a good CV should look like, but i'm not having much luck - a lot of the sources I find are focussed on a US jobs market, and the UK-based resources I find don't always agree.

Would any /r/ukjobs redditors who work in IT be willing to either take a look over my own CV, or forward me to a copy of theirs so that I can get a feel for what's good and what's not?

TLDR: I would like some help with my CV - please take a look at mine, or send me yours :)

Thank you,

So the general consensus is that Amy (and Rory the Undying Roman) receive the Doctor's blue envelopes, see the 1100 year old Doctor ""die"", go on adventures with the 900 year old Doctor, and finally the Doctor drops them at their home. Although this is not proven, afterwards Amy starts a perfume company and becomes a mini-celebrity.

Now, how does the alternate reality in an aborted timeline fit in with this ? Reasonably speaking, Amy would have dual memories of what happened Lake Silencio.  Fine. But then, why, and more importantly when, is she crying over the Doctor's death at the end of the episode ? This can't be Amy after the shooting - because that one went away with the ""900"" year Doctor. If it is the one who was dropped at their homes by the Doctor, then her (immediate nature of) sadness doesn't really make much sense. When asked by River as to where is she, Amy replies ""the Doctor is dead"".

They once did something they should not have done, and went to a place none should go. There, the reckless young man decided to engage in combat with a great monster. But the young man was smart, and skilled in magic, and he had a box in which he could trap the monster.

But in order to trap the monster in the box, he had to trick it. So he played a game with it. A game of riddles. As the game wore on, he added a condition; if one of the two answered incorrectly, they would go into the box. There they would remain, until they spoke the answer to the riddle. And, to make sure the monster trusted him, he would deliberately lose some questions, only to know as soon as he went into the box. And then it came time to spring the trap.

""What is my name?"" the young man asked.

""Doctor,"" the monster said.

""No,"" the young man said. ""That was the name I told to you.""

And so the monster was trapped, and has been for a very long time, waiting for some clue.

[tl;dr: I think the Doctor's real name is the password to a prison in which something terrible, which could bring the end of time itself, is kept. It would explain why the Doctor decides that he needs to go off to his death once he learns the question, but is fine with faking it and continuing to live in secret. Because even if it is inevitable, he just needs the time to work out the plan B he hasn't prepared yet. Which also explains why River knowing his name is a shock, but not something incredibly dangerous to him.

Sorry for making you read what turned a little bit into fanfiction, it's just that the real justification for my theory was that this sort of trickery, and playing games with real names, goes back to the oldest folk tales. So the real proof that the idea might be true is that it works as a story that might get passed down and morphed into other stories.] ",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Fairy Tales and names...

However, in comparison to some of the other clubs, [City's 2011-12 page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011-12_Manchester_City_F.C._season) really isn't very thorough.

For starters, a vital table is missing on the page: there is no tally of assist leaders.  Whilst in the realm of statistics, (in my opinion) a vital statistic of minutes played for each player is also missing.

Arguably, the most important thing missing is a summary of each month.  

In contrast, here's [Real Madrid's page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011-12_Real_Madrid_C.F._season) and [Barca's page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_FC_Barcelona_season) to show an example of a ""more complete"" wikipedia page.

So, as a request, since I can't do it myself (never edited an article on wikipedia), can someone do this?  Or if you don't have the know-how, can you at least circulate this request of a better page among some other MCFC fan forums?

Whilst writing monthly summaries would be somewhat difficult, not only becuase pre-season dates back to July, but becuase it is the most subjective of the sections.  But it should be very easy to compile all the statistical information for the club.  So while summaries may be a little too much to ask for, I think City's page could have a bit more statistical data.

Thanks

The Silence are a religious order who believes that silence will fall upon the universe when the question is asked. Specifically, when the Doctor is asked his name on the plains (or planes) of... somewhere whose name I forget. Contrary to what had been sort of implied before, they're not trying to bring on this silence, they're trying to prevent this from occurring.

Questions:

1. If they're trying to avoid the silence, then ""The Silence"" is a pretty silly name for their religious order, isn't it? How about ""The Silence Avoiders"" or ""The Noise""?

2. This shouldn't need to be *that* complicated. All you've got to do is stop the Doctor from showing up at the Planes of Whatever. One obvious solution: go up to the Doctor and say ""Hey, dude, whatever you do, avoid such-and-such a place, or else you'll destroy the universe"". ""Oh, right-o"" says the Doctor, and adds an extra subroutine to the Tardis's navigaion computer just to make sure he never ends up there. 

3. But if they're more genre-savvy than that, and they know that the Doctor will eventually wind up there inadvertently anyway, telling him about it is still probably the best option. We all know that the Doctor would be quite willing to sacrifice himself in order to save the universe, so a quick chat would probably be enough to persuade him to take himself out of the equation.

4. Failing that, and supposing they really just want to kill him themselves just to be sure, kidnapping and training River Song seems to be an incredibly overly elaborate plan. How about using some of your damn near omnipresent agents to do the job? He's not even that hard to kill. I've seen him killed by street punks and falls from a moderate height. All you gotta do then is shoot him while he's regenerating.

5. Assuming it was the Silence who blew up the Tardis, I assume that must have been their Plan A and River Song was their plan B? I'm not even going to go into the timey-wimey implications of that, but given that blowing up the Tardis managed to destroy the entire universe it seems like a pretty darn counterproductive way to go about saving it. It also means we've had two season finales in a row where the basic plot is ""actually the bad guys are trying to save the universe from being inadvertently destroyed by the Doctor"". I'm thinking the Doctor needs to spend less time doing housecalls and more time thinking about how to avoid destroying the universe.

6. Finally, what the hell does everything *else* have to do with the core beliefs of The Silence? Why are subtly enslaving Earth? Is this all part of their incredibly roundabout way of killing the Doctor? Because, *man*, that's roundabout.

And finally finally, why the hell are they the bad guys at all? They're just trying to save the universe, albeit in an incredibly overly complicated sort of way that could probably be avoided via a quick chat over a cup of tea.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,So why are the Silence the bad guys again?

Now we have breathing space until Christmas, I thought it might be good to take stock of what's left, and what new mysteries have been created.  

(Please note that, while some of these may be obvious, some may be pure fanwank, and I really don't expect some to ever be answered)

These are the questions that I can think of at the moment:

- how did the Silence get in the TARDIS in the Big Bang, and how did they blow it up?
- what is the Doctor's real name, why is it the oldest question in the universe, and why is it so important?
- is the mystery of the Doctor's name related to the Cartmel Masterplan, as some are speculating?
- River knew the Doctor's real name in Silence in the Library, but he didn't tell her when they got married (Rule 1!), so when will he? And why?
- what awaits the Doctor at the fields of Trenzalore?
- is ""the fall of the Eleventh"" referring to the next regeneration?
- if you assume that River is serving time in the Stormcage for the Doctor's murder in order to preserve the secret that he didn't die, then why was she released (at sometime prior to Silence in the Library, presumably)?
- What sort of University makes a convicted murderer/war criminal a Professor?
-what are the beliefs of the religious order of the Silence? Beyond wanting the Doctor to die, we don't actually know that much about them, or why they're so eeeeevil.
- at some point, religious military orders change from being evil, as seem in A Good Man Goes to War, to noble (for want of a better word) in The Time of Angels and Flesh and Stone.  What brings about the change?
- who are the Teselecta, and are they related to the Time Agency that once employed Jack?

Anyone think of more?

****

Dear Steven Moffat,

Youâre great. Really! Youâre probably the most clever writer on television right now, or at least youâre in the top ranks. Watching *Sherlock* is a fucking treat, your twisted genius unravels beautifully with the passing of each episode, and your scripts for it me want to be a better writer. *Coupling*  was okay, I mean, it was occasionally crude and a bit overt, but funny and definitely not the worst. The sitcom as a platform is pretty passÃ© now, so itâs not youâre fault that itâs lost a bit of its flavor.

Then thereâs *Doctor Who*. I was ecstatic when you took over as head writer, as the episodes you wrote for the first four seasons were among all the best. âThe Empty Childâ/âThe Doctor Dancesâ (the invention of Jack Harkness! Everybody lives! Bananas! Nanobots! A motherâs love!), âThe Girl in the Fireplaceâ (overall fantastic, I mean, really great work here), âBlinkâ (which is arguably the best episode of *Doctor Who* that has ever been written, and is definitely a great standalone episode that anyoneâeven people who are not fans of the showâcan enjoy) and âSilence in the Libraryâ/âForest of the Deadâ (which was okay, but the transition of power had started at this point and your affinity for unfinished plot arcs meant this episode had to be everything it was, but it was still a decent and scary episode). All of these set a precedent for your time as head writer, a standard of writing, an expectation for a specific style and a certain level of elegance in storytelling. When I sat down to watch the first episode of the fifth season, I was not disappointed. No one was.

But actually, while the fifth season was pretty okay, I mean, I wasnât a huge fan at first because you took a long time to develop the companions. The stories were very cutesy and sentimental, but the leading actors held everything together by being gorgeous and excellent at their jobs.

The sixth season is a different story. On the good side, youâve brought up fantastic philosophical/moral issues (i.e., death, identity, causality, responsibility) and while the season has been quite dark, the jokes have improved. I commend you for that. On the bad side, youâve needlessly overcomplicated the plot and done downright pitiful things with characters who had great potential, thereby driving the show into the ridiculous and overwrought province of Annoying.

Iâm perturbed by the direction the show is taking. Not to say that the writing before you took over was ideal, it wasnât, it was awkward and a little silly, but Iâm afraid that youâve struck an odd balance at this point. Youâre attempting to make *Doctor Who* a show that people theorize about, a show with plots that drive people crazy and that causes fans to watch and rewatch episodes looking for the most subtle hints and ideas that will improve their understanding and their predictions. In the meantime, *Doctor Who* has taken a hit to storytelling. People love shows like *Lost*, because we enjoy imagination and drama and complexity exceeding that of everyday life. Even so, *Doctor Who* is not Lost and you are not the writers of *Lost*. Youâve created great characters and told great stories with Jack Harkness in âThe Empty Childâ, with your fictionalized Madame de Pompadour in âThe Girl in the Fireplaceâ, with Sally Sparrow, with River Song (!!!); you have the ability to tell great stories that affect people and speak to human experience. So why donât you? Why do you insist on pushing the show in this new direction? *Doctor Who* is humanism personified, itâs âthe triumph of romance and intellect over brute force and cynicismâ. Itâs beautiful science fiction meant to expound a unique interpretation of experience. What youâre writing is a completely different show.

What I love about *Doctor Who* is the stories that it tells. I love the complexity of your plots and I enjoy theorizing about what mad thing will happen next, but Iâm unfulfilled by the stories youâre telling. *Doctor Who* is the most satisfying and fulfilling show Iâve ever watched, and because of that itâs like an addiction. Youâre turning it into a different kind of addiction, a great addiction, but an addiction that is really uncalled for. I, and I think a lot of people, preferred when watching *Doctor Who* was a time of more relaxed engagement, when episodes were simple enough to allow the storytelling to shine. Sometimes I think you use your clever plots to keep us asking questions and concentrating on weird theories so as to distract us from lazy storytelling, and sometimes I think youâre just a sadist.

In all, perhaps I should embrace the new direction of *Doctor Who*. Iâm not entirely opposed to change or new direction in fiction. I didnât mind when the Harry Potter books became all about death and destruction and love. I guess I just feel like *Doctor Who* isnât embracing itself the way the Harry Potter books did. Doctor Who is still trying to be a kids show with cute things and silly things and scary things that are simple enough to induce benign nightmares in the minds of the young, but itâs trying at this in an annoyingly condescending way, in an adult way, reminiscent of the way adults would talk if they were trying to sort-of include a child in a conversation about something they couldnât expect a child to understand.

If you want me to enjoy *Doctor Who* like I used to (of course you do), you need to ditch the hipstery look-at-me-Iâm-clever-and-grown-up act and stop masturbating onto everything you write. Concentrate on telling great stories and stop hiding the shock value. Itâs distracting and annoying and Iâm not buying it.

Lots of love,  
Me

The Tesselacta were barely explained. So were the motivations of the Silence, or even who the hell Madam Kovarian is. I understand Moffat likes to keep secrets, but I've found it really hard to care, which I felt especially in A Good Man Goes to War, where I have literally no idea who the enemy is or motivation as to why I should care about their fight. It's just someone, out there, who wants the Doctor dead, and until the end, the Doctor didn't seem to give much of a whit as to why, which is very unlike him.

It was wholly clear in series 5 why his enemies had built the Pandorica - he'd defeated them all. They were ruined on account of the Doctor. But why the Silence needed the Doctor dead... all on account of some question? And we're not even revealed this motivation until the very, very  end. I mean, at least troll us with a fake motivation so we have something to go on.

Everytime I see somebody complaining about this or that, or fretting over why CHARACTER X is a poor example of whatever, or blazenly spewing their criticism of the series, I feel like I need to remind you of one simple fact that should help you get some perspective...

The show isn't for you. It's not your show. This isn't Firefly or Battlestar or LOST or any other show designed and tailored for you adult fans... this is a show for children which the writers have had the common courtesy to write in such a way that it is also acceptable for adults. Sometimes I think you don't quite realize how difficult that is, balancing a show like that... writing something designed for ""families"", not just one group of people. That sort of thing takes sheer talent.

I have a younger sister, and all her friends at school apparently unanimously agree that the latest two series have been the best two series since the revival. They absolutely love it, every bit; They love Matt as the sort of young-but-old school geography teacher who keeps telling you about the adventures he went on in El Salvador, they love River as this mysterious parallel to the Doctor. Girls love Amy because for once they created a companion which emulates young girls; Amy is the girl that waited, that young girl who almost got whisked off on this mad amazing adventure with this wonderful man, and boys like her because... Well, come on, it's Karen. The adventures have been more focused on time travel which both perplexes and excites the youngers, and the show has shed that campiness that shrouded it during the Davies' series. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed them greatly, but in retrospect personally I much prefer the newer shows.

Anyway, the point I'm driving at is that the show isn't yours, it's the kid's and they love it. It's like a fairytale now, everything about it is just so much more magical than it used to be. When Stephen Moffat sits down and begins to write a story, he's not writing for a bunch of adult fans in America... that's just a bonus to the integrity and popularity of the show that it has such a widespread fanbase. When he sits down to create something like the Weeping Angels or the Silence, he's only got one thought in his mind: Scaring the shit out of children around the same age as his own kids. That's the beauty of the new series, and is why it's being so well-received and rated up-and-down the country.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,Here's why the past two series have been the best two series:,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/kz1e9/heres_why_the_past_two_series_have_been_the_best/

They share a few back and forth lines exactly the same as River and Matt Smith's Doctor. 

 They aren't really moments made to introduce new characters or plots. They are just back and forth moments between the characters to create substance and connect them. Tom Bakers Doctor and Drax discuss school days and nicknames. In a way i felt like Matt and Alex were almost making an homage to this episode.

 That's my thought on it. no need to get bent out of shape when every single detail isn't laid out for you like a banquet meal. The mysteries and questions about The Doctor are what makes Doctor Who work as a show....even the writers have said that.

&gt;**The School Food Trust**, which examined 3,500 packed lunches in England in 2009, says about 40% of lunchboxes do not contain any fruit or vegetables, compared with 10% of school dinners.

So, who is **""The School Food Trust""**?

[The trust is governed by a board appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_Food_Trust) was initially funded by a Â£15 million grant from the Department for Education and Skills, and has been awarded in partnership with organisations including The Prince's Trust, Business in the Community, Magic Outcomes and the Improvement Foundation, Â£20 million additional funding from the Big Lottery Fund for a network of school children's cookery clubs called Let's Get Cooking.

Okay.. so who is on the board of this ""health trust"" that seems to be a government funded charity think tank?

have a look: http://www.schoolfoodtrust.org.uk/about-us/our-board

IS is just me or is this a government funded quango giving $$$ to fat ass wankers saying ""hey kids.. eat fresh food"" and then the BBC calls them **health experts**

I wonder if this BS will work for me?.... 

Hey peeps.. I'm a sexual health expert.. ""MASTERBATE.. IT'S GOOD FOR YOU"".. now where the fuck is my Â£100,000 a year from government and lottery funding... and my OBE?

There were also two largish bags of what looked like grass, one labelled 'Super Skunky Legal High' and the other I forget the name of.

They were Â£6 each, I would say it looked like 300g or so.

If I go back for the box I might get a bag (I'll look like a twat for asking for it), but wondered if anyone had tried it.

If I wanted some green I can get it, just interested in hearing if anyone else has tried these 'legal smokable highs' and what the effects were.

Did Andy Carroll do enough to put the absurd Higuain rumours to bed.

Did the sending off make the game irrelevant from a manager's perspective. Did the sending off make it feel more like we earned 2 points rather than 3.

Are spurs the current favorites for the 4th spot. Was Scott Parker a much better signing than Charlie Adam. Is the owner's strong preference for youth hurting our squad.

I honestly laughed out loud when I first watched the finale, because my immediate interpretation at ""Utah is a still point in time"" was an LDS-related jab at being homophobic and therefore not advancing with the rest of us to modern times (a still point?). I guess at this point, I got so used to Moffatt inserting gay-related jokes in Doctor Who that my mind immediately went there without much prompting.

I can't come to terms with it, and everyone else seems to enjoy the party. Seriously, what was the necessity to do the whole ceremony with string + parents' consent thing? The Doctor is not going to have a normal married life with a house and babies / a relationship or anything. On the basis of what we know of River, they'll just be meeting each other randomly on their timelines.

Secondly, time rewind magic did occur when he simply held her wrist before. It's not that they HAD to get married for it to happen again.

Why have trial by jury in public interest cases (not that my example is one; cases in which the public have an interest tend not to be the cases the public find interesting) when the popular opinion of the public could all but override the verdict?

I'll admit my knowledge of the likelihood of courts becoming teleivised is limited to an overheard 5live debate in which a particpant tried to argue that newspapers are more tightly regulated than television- I do not know what the proposals are in any detail, I just know I don't want it as any part of my justice system.

edit: i was emotionally gripped in the appeal tonight for a completely arbitary reason that I can't quite put my finger on: in a way, I feel relieved in the verdict, because it has truly brought out the worst in the media (SEX  DRUGS DEATH HOT GIRL), and perhaps that balance has been redressed.

Unfortunately, I can't get Sky at my property so I'm left without much of a choice. I signed up over the phone two weeks ago and after much fussing about was told that I could have a priority install for free. Well, the install date arrived last week and the engineer didn't pitch at the agreed time. Turns out I wasn't booked for a priority install at all. CS proceeded to give me two further ETAs, both of which the engineer missed before I had to give up and leave for work.

Since then, I've made 10-12 calls trying to arrange an install date earlier than the one they've given me - three weeks from their missed appointment. I've had three promises of callbacks from the pre-install cancellations department and none have materialised.

 One of the of the issues that has been growing on me over the last 2 seasons is the fact that doctor's guilt and self loathing is becoming an issue for the dynamic of the show. How can you keep taking companions if you ""know"" that you are going to ruin them? 

The moment at the wedding with the distress beacon when River shows him that millions (billions?) of aliens had come to help him I hope will act as a lightbulb moment for him. I love Matt's weariness but it is preventing the Doctor from having a bit of fun. At some point, he needs to feel good about himself, or the show will have to continue to force him to have companions. (e.g. He took Amy because of the crack in the wall and he knew something was wrong since she had no parents and didn't notice).

Now the questions.

What is the deal with the freaking bow tie colours? Did I miss an explanation? Is it a red herring? was he just changing bow ties and it had no relevance?

I'll add thoughts to this as I watch the episode, so you can all watch me lose my Doctor Who virginity!

[By the way, here's the post that started this](http://redd.it/kzltp)

UPDATE 1 - That pre-opening-credit scene was pretty intriguing.  Definitely wondering what's going on.  I was amused by how many times the Doctor had to write ""duck.""  I'm also wondering how he knew where she was going to rip the wallpaper without being there at that moment.  Unless he was there?  

UPDATE 2 - OK, so that angel statue is what I'm assuming people were talking about in the DAE when they said the angels were scary?  I don't know about scary, but it's definitely up to something...

UPDATE 3 - I'm so confused, but in a good way.  Like, I understand what's going on, but I have no idea WHY any of it would be going on.

UPDATE 4 - So the friend is the letter guy's grandmother?!  Even more interesting!

UPDATE 5 - The friend told her husband she was 18.  LOL

UPDATE 6 - This episode seems to be taking on quite a lot of various ideas simultaniously (the ~~TV's~~ 17 DVDs, the angels, the random traveling back in time)... Is this indicative of most episodes, or is this one especially dense with things going on?

UPDATE 7 - That cop is my new hero.  

UPDATE 8 - The angels are starting to get sorta scary.

UPDATE 9 - Killing people via time travel is certainly one of the most imaginative methods I've heard of...

UPDATE 10 - Telling the old cop exactly when he would die seems like a sort of shitty thing to do...

UPDATE 11 - I like the Doctor's description of time.

FINAL UPDATE - That was honestly fantastic.  It felt like it was a 20 minute episode, definitely not 40.  Thank you so much to everyone who pushed me into this.

With that in mind...is it possible that the Silence, finding out sometime after TWoRS that the Doctor survived, went back before the supposed death at Lake Silencio, to try and kill him another way?

So earlier this year, the EU announced that carriers had to offer phones on 12 month contracts: http://media.ofcom.org.uk/2011/05/25/changes-to-european-telecoms-law-%E2%80%93-benefits-for-uk-consumers/

Here's the full document: http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/gc-usc/statement

Point 1.13 states:

&gt;users generally must be offered a contract option, for the provision of public electronic communication services , whose duration is no more than 12 months

What I'm wondering is how widespread is this legislation? Obviously it's in the context of the iPhone 4S/5 being announced today. Currently, O2 doesn't offer the 3GS nor the 4 on a 12-month contract.

I feel his story telling is solely aimed at the ""Aha! Gotcha!""  moments. Some of his writings are just gibberish plots filled of unnecessary moments just to keep you guessing. He's abused the whole ""Wibbly-Wobbly"" to point where the show is all paradoxes.

Moffat has done so much at the cost of character growth and development. In just two seasons he killed The Doctor and blew up the TARDIS. He's introduced a villain that is so obscure, that makes it hard to understand what he's up against. We have no sense of scale.

The Silence: Despite their abilities being so over powered they cant seem to get the job done. Moffat introduced them in SE05 and were not shown until SE06. That was kinda cool, but what was there involvement in SE05? I have no idea. Silence will fall. Aliens that escaped the crack mentioned that they were escaping the Silence. Wasn't that cause of the TARDIS explosion? Are they involved with the memory erasing in The Beast Below? Who knows. The play on words of ""Silence"",  ""The Silence"" and being able to alter memory makes it impossible to follow.

TARDIS exploding: Why would you involve a storyline where the iconic TARDIS explodes and not explain why? When it's revealed that the TARDIS door was found in the crack by The Doctor, you're left speechless. By the way, what the hell happened in TARDIS in LKH with the whole fish sticks and custard?

The Doctor: This Doctor is a complete dick. I personally love Smith, dont get me wrong. He's the perfect offset to Tennant. But he's done some dark shit and he never grew as a character nor was redeemed. He's a bit cold. In SE05 he helped in the extinction of the vampires in The Vampires of Venice. In SE06 he has everyone that sees the moon landing kill The Silence on sight.  He never spoke to The Silence and trying to figure out what's what. After events of SE06 Rebel Flesh with the moral story of they are just alive as we are, we has no problems melting Flesh Amy and helping the Flesh Doctor do the same. What he did to Rory in SE06's The Girl What Waited is simply unforgiveable.

His Faux Death: Instead of embracing his death at the end while understanding WHY he needs to die, he simply just cheats death via a loophole in the time law. He never faced what he has become. This conflict was reintroduced in Demon's Run but never panned out. There was no ""Time Lord Victorious"" regret moment. What was the price he has to pay? He just has to lay low for now.

All in all, i find it hard to like a hero that's 1st rule is he lies. When did this take precedence over everything else? Lying is not a good quality to have. I understand the he has to lie at times since he's a step a head but he's just become deceitful.

Perhaps it is a fixed point that can be adjusted through a bit of deception. I could imagine that 11 or 12 version of the Doctor might just find a way to restore her after she dies. 

The question may be why would the Doctor let her die? He would need 10 to possibly upload her conscious so he wouldn't inadvertently cross his on earlier time stream and create a paradox that keeps them from finally falling in love. He first meets her and in part falls for her because she is a paradox herself. Her existence is something completely unnatural. She's fully human yet also a timelord due to her altered DNA. She is not Galifreyan but the Doctor doesn't care. She's experienced time and space like he has. Heck, she can actually fly the Tardis. He plays at flying it. It's the running joke from Doctor 1 to Doctor 11.

It is possible that she doesn't know what the Doctor has as a next step for them because of spoilers that would ruin that future timeline. The Doctor may cheat and create a way to technically let Riversong die so the time authorities will leave her alone but revive her after death. This could lead to a revived River Song that could then be regenerated. Her body wasn't in the chair when 10 came back by it to upload her conscious. He could just download and restore her somehow perhaps through sacrificing final regenerations.

Riversong becomes not only the catalyst that changes his forever alone view but also it could allow them to travel the time stream together in the same direction. Riversong becomes the Doctor's fixed point like he is hers. Also the Doppleganger 11 Doctor could become the Doctor (the Other) that goes back in time and creates the technology that creates the society that creates the Galifreyan ability to time travel. He could even sacrifice himself in the Looms (the technology that births the Galifreyans) to create the other version of himself (ie our Doctor). In the original series (go back to Hartwell era) it was shown that other alien civilizations and even humans had the ability to time travel. The difference is that the Galifreyans were basically cosmic snobs that had mastered living centuries longer and felt superior to all other species do to this.

Basically our Riversong (3) does indeed die back with Doctor (10). Doctor (11) marries her, loves her, and probably figures out how to eventually save her so they can continue. My guess is 11 will eventually die saving Riversong (3) in a way that allows her to regenerate so that Doctor (12) and Riversong (4) can go on together throughout time.

It would be so fun to have discussions about the show with lots of others.

The only problem I see is that I'm not sure we could all get a hold of all the same episodes... Netflix streaming only has a few of the classic episodes and they don't really match up with the recommendations from the Classic Who thread.  Also, I think it only goes up through season 5.

But by putting River in the space suit, the Doctor's lover, they know they Doctor wouldn't killed her to stop her from killing him. The only issue with this idea is how Mel behaved in LKH, she literally attempted and almost did kill the Doctor. Or is this just hinting at the fact that the Doctor has a masochistic nature/love of death and he could only truly love someone who want to kill him, or does it hint at the Doctor only be able to love someone that he ""saves"" from being ""evil""? I not sure I'm happy with either explanation for her actions in LKH but I am pretty sure that if there was anyone else in that space suit the Doctor wouldn't have let them kill him and the Silence must of known it from the start.

Iâve been looking on DirectGov about [loans]( http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/UniversityAndHigherEducation/StudentFinance/Typesoffinance/DG_171539) and [grants]( http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/UniversityAndHigherEducation/StudentFinance/Typesoffinance/DG_171557) but Iâm hearing conflicting information from other people about how it works.

Firstly I need to know whether my girlfriend living with me counts as living at home or not, since this is our home but Iâve also heard that âliving at homeâ means living with your parents.

Secondly Iâve heard that mature students automatically get the full loan, is this true? If not is the income assessed on my income or both of our incomes?

Thirdly I also think that our income would qualify her to get a grant, but Iâve heard that mature students canât get grants, anyone know if this is true?

Apologies if Iâm missing something obvious, but if anyone knows how any of this works it would be a great help. Weâre planning to talk to someone at the university sheâs thinking of attending about it but Iâd rather know asap, and the information on the internet about it is confusing.

Us

See www.policyexpert.co.uk for our just-launched insurance venture. Itâs early days and we are planning for many more insurers within our bespoke quote engine as well as additional high-volume consumer products such as Motor insurance. We will also be live on traditional aggregator panels later this week.

We are prepared, financed and aiming to make a significant impact on the online insurance channel within the next year. We are building a first-class administration portal for our Call Centre in Milton Keynes too.

We are bunch of 12 software professionals - a pair of kick-ass QA engineers and two UI experts alongside our 2 teams of first-class server-side developers. We are agile (with a small âaâ) in nature, and striving to build a really great environment for application development and delivery alongside our engaged and empowered product owners.

No Project Managers - we believe in hands-on delivery, not managing expectations.
No titles - we are flat in structure and everyone has the same opportunity to step up!
No Sys Admins - Production is the ultimate phase in the SDLC and we are proud of our code.
No legacy code - Greenfield platform with the latest tools and technologies.
High barrier to entry - Expect to code, pair and whiteboard during your application.

Brand new 27â iMacâs - We invest in excellence in both people and tools.
Amazon AWS - Highly scalable initial architecture proving itâs worth in Amazonâs datacentreâs.
Agile - We are re-evaluating all the time, incorporating new ideas, ditching old ones. Donât expect to sit still for too long...
Top drawer performance - Proud of our out-of-the-box Google Page Speed result, millisecond quote engine calculations, 80% / 94% code coverage and 12/12 on the Joel Test.
The good stuff - Java 6, MySQL, Tomcat 7, Apache 2.2, Hibernate, Spring, OO, AWS, GitHub, Maven, Nexus, memcached, Capistrano, Ruby, OSSEC, Ajax, JavaScript, IntelliJ, TeamCity...

You

10 years or 10,000 hours experience in predominantly Java and Open Source technologies.
Either a software architect who codes or a developer who understands architecture, weâll be interested to hear how you think the two are different!
Demonstrated delivery of high-availability, scalable web applications and architectures.
Experience of the full SDLC - must include production systems and trouble-shooting.
Very keen to grasp the opportunity to significantly direct business solutions.
Willing to tell us why youâre exceptional and what makes you that way.
Willing to tell us where we can improve and to challenge the status quo.

Do yourself a favor and watch them both. Good stuff.

I just finished the movie. I couldn't help but notice the how similar it is to SE06's  Let's Kill Hitler. 

The 8th Doctor mentions the he almost died (proper death) if the anesthetic lasted a bit longer. He mentions it was messing with his ability to regenerate. This was great since the scene of River poising The Doctor without him being able to regenerate kind of irritated me.

The Master's plot to steal The Doctor's remaining regenerations is how River saves The Doctor at the end of LKH.

While captured, The Master is setting up his final preparations to steal The Doctor's remaining they have this little conversation:
The Master: That's why there's no time to waste.
The Doctor: But time to change.
The Master: [now wearing traditional Time Lord clothing] I always dress for the occasion.

That was so reminiscent of Melody's exchange with The Doctor:
Melody: You're dying and you stopped to change?
The Doctor: (spins) Oh, you should always waste time when you don't have any. (walks down the steps twirling the cane) Time is not the boss of you - Rule 408.


Cannon questions:
Time Lords can only regenerate 12 times. Since River gave her regenerations to The Doctor, it's safe to assume we wouldn't be running into any issues. I imagine that some of my questions/confusion is based from the director's  creative freedoms.

â¢	Have Time Lords always had a 12 regen limit?

â¢	Do we ever see The Master get killed by the Daleks in a previous episode/movie?

â¢	What's with The Master's ability to posses people and glaze them? 
â¢	Why was The Master so...""reptilian""?

â¢	Since the transformation from the 8th to the 9th Doctor is off screen, when does this take place lore-wise? Would it be the Time War?


All in all, it was a great watch. I couldn't help make the comparison of the 8th Doctor's angry acting to Gene Wilder's version of Willy Wonka scolding Charlie. ""Good day, sir!""

I originally posted an Internship position for my company here and in the time between postings we found a lovely intern who has now become our community manager, so Iâm putting the idea out there again.

I know some people here arenât entirely happy about unpaid internships. Thatâs fair enough, and I should note that there is no payment for this position. We do cover up to Â£500 a month travel expenses and provide you with free games. Our Community Manager now has ALL the Railworks DLC on his Steam account, so thatâs a bonus.

While we canât guarantee a position weâve had hired our last two interns, which is a good amount of success. Iâve not seen us let anyone promising leave in the last 7 months ;) I was also an intern here, and now I'm really super important and have my own iPad holder.

This position will include making and editing our product pages, approving and monitoring customer reviews, helping out on our forums, helping the operations team with marketing tasks like creating contact sheets, researching and contacting other gaming sites, helping out with social media, writing blog posts and so much more.

We don't have a really long list of definite requirements: You need to be able to speak and write English really well, and you need to be able to use a computer, Office, FTP and all the usual stuff. Knowledge of gaming is very important as well, obviously.

We'd be looking for someone to commit to about a month of roughly 9-5 hours, we can be reasonably flexible on that.

Drop me a line at robert.clarke@greenmangaming.com if you want more information :) If you applied before and I never replied â I apologise, feel free to apply again.

1. How does disguising as the teselecta save time? When River reprograms her weapons systems and saves the doctor, time begins to disintegrate, because she changes a fixed point in time. The fixed point in time is the Doctor dying, not the Doctor appearing to die... It's not like someone's sitting on the side with a button and if the doctor doesn't die they destroy time, time disintegrates because the Doctor doesn't die when he's supposed to. When the Doctor disguises himself as the Teselecta, he still survives. It doesn't matter that people think he's dead, that shouldn't affect the fabric of time. He still re-writes history, and time should begin to disintegrate.

2. In season 1, episode 8 (fathers day), Rose and the Doctor go back in time, and Rose saves her dad, re-writing a fixed point in time. The messes up the fabric of time, and these dragon things come and start killing people to fix it. The doctor says this is what happens when you re-write history. In TWoRS, why does time disintegrate, instead of those dragon/scorpion things coming and killing people again? I understand it would be really silly considering the current story arc, and I wouldn't want Moffat to write that in, but its annoying how he just goes against all the physics of DW. 

3. How does the Doctor decide what is a fixed point in time and what isn't? We know he's been wrong before (the fires of pompeii), but sometimes he flips his shit at someone for wanting to go back in time and change things, meanwhile he goes back and changes things all the time. I know a lot of the time when Doctor changes things the event weren't supposed to happen, and only happened because there was another time-traveling party involved (for example in ""The Empty Child"", when Jack Harkness causes everyone to turn into a zombie - thing because he threw an object through time, and this isn't part of time travel, because time travel was involved), but other times it there is no such explanation. Off the top of my head, in ""The Impossible Planet/Satans Pit"", the Doctor saves the miners on the colony, and this is somehow not a fixed point in time. I know this isn't as relevant to TWoRS, but I was still wondering.

I'm really confused about a lot of stuff in Doctor Who right now, and it's very possible that I'm missing something. Anyways, it would be really great if anyone had some answers to these.

- Is there some way to be certain whose autograph this is? If I were to take a photo and post it up, would any of you be able to decisively identify it?; and

- Have I got something valuable on my hands here? As much as I'd love to hang on to a piece of memorabilia like this, if I can make a few bucks off of it and maybe pay off a few bills, I will.

Jordan and I were 17 and 16 respectively. We both loved Stargate SG-1 and had several other things in common. We got to know each other really well, and he and his sister and I were inseparable. They lived 45 minutes away and yet I would spend a few days each month with them. I've spent so much time with them I consider them family. Jordan is my brother.

Suddenly, Doctor Who.

I'm not sure if Jordan or I got into it first. I really don't recall. I know our first Doctor was Nine, although his new favorite is now Ten. Anyway, through our long-distance relationship my brother and I really bonded over Doctor Who. We would quote shamelessly, stream episodes simultaneously while on the phone together, and come up with really dorky jokes. Doctor Who was not the extent of our relationship, but it was one of the main things that made it possible.

For instance, we decided that if he became a Doctor he would have something far more manly than a screwdriver, like a pipe wrench. Observe his photoshop skills [here](http://imgur.com/FbHS2).

We both went to fairly small rural high schools and I was the ONLY person in my school that even knew what DW was, and he (besides his wonderful sister) was the only person in his school. So we kept each other sane.

Anyway, Jordan and his family are Mormons. (THIS IS NOT AN OPENING FOR A RELIGIOUS DISCUSSION.) Jordan loves his religion and made the decision to serve a 'mission,' a two-year turn of service and preaching. He will not be able to watch any Doctor Who. He left in January. He will be back in January 2013.

I am unsubbing to r/DoctorWho because I promised Jordan that I wouldn't watch a single episode, learn a single spoiler, or learn any plot lines. Being subbed to r/DoctorWho is making that kinda difficult. Back in the day, I was his person to talk about Doctor Who with and he was mine. We watched at the same pace. I don't want to have two years worth of DW for him to catch up on when he gets back. We can catch up together.

So thanks, r/DoctorWho, for being awesome, and intelligent, and being a huge community of people for people like Jordan and me who don't have anyone else. We'll see you later.

Bonus picture: [Jordan and I went to a prom together with matching sneakers.](http://imgur.com/UwI7i)

**tl;dr: I'm not watching ANY Doctor Who in honor of a friend who is serving a religious mission and cannot watch either. So I'm unsubbing for the sake of spoilers.**

I'll keep up with this post for a day or two, but you won't see me around r/DoctorWho for quite a while. Thank you.

I wondered why people think like this?

I live in Australia now, but lived most of my life in UK, and this sentiment is something I found all the time (I even subscribed to it.  If I saw a house with a Union Flag out the window, my first thought was 'chav').  I've discussed it with people from other countries, and it's something that very few other places have.  The Australian Flag is proudly flying all around.  People have tattoos, people have towels, people wear shorts (I'll admit, I don't want to see a bunch of old guys with white see through union jack shorts on St Georges Day, I'm just saying).  Australia Day is a day where everybody celebrates.  But in the UK we do not have this.

We do not celebrate St Georges Day, we are told we cannot put up the flag.  Here are some thoughts I have had as to why we accept this-

a) We are overly sensitive about looking like a hooligan.  Especially after the 80's, where football hooliganism was a massive issue, and we were shown on the national stage to be a group of skin headed, loud-mouthed idiots.  the typical image of a football hooligan has a Union Flag tattoo/singlet/cape, so we try our best to look nothing like this.

b) we have actually bought into the idea that an English Flag will offend someone else.  This is one of the those crazy notions that makes absolutely no sense to me.  I've heard many a person say 'The Muslims are offended by our flag so we have to take it down'.  No. No they are not.  I know lots of Pakistani, Indian, Caribbean, and many more people who have moved to England.  They have no issue with the flag.  They like the flag.  They also like their own countries flag, but seeing the Union Flag is fine by them. True, one or two idiots may not like it.  But instead or ignoring those one or two angry people, the government seem to think that this one loud mouth speaks for every single brown skinned person in the UK.  This is not the case.

I think this thought process has come around as we are so worried about looking like we are racist.  After years of doing terrible things to other nations/colours, we are now morally paying back.  But in doing so, we are losing our own identity somewhat.

I'd just like to hear others thoughts on the subject.

Let me state that there will be spoilers in this post.

I feel that the tenth doctor is pushing for humanity a bit much. The ninth doctor was proud of humans, even impressed by them, but it did not seem to me that he was actually going to bat for them at all times. Maybe it was his constant chastising of humans for being such sheep and letting themselves be subservient that is making me overlook the feature?

Beyond that, I find this series to be so amazingly engaging and full of life and wonderment. Following the scheme that I found outlined here for a newbie's guide to the Doctor, I feel as though I am getting the most of my experience. There is little that is unexplained in the new series, but watching the older episodes for fill-in information, for me, is like reading the codec entries in Mass Effect or the books strewn about Oblivion. While I did not need to watch the Genesis of the Daleks to understand how malevolent and destructive they are, it gave me better insight as to why the Doctor was both afraid of, and inspired by the lone Dalek he meets.

As it was designed to, The Girl in the Fireplace truly got to me. While the playful atmosphere between the Doctor and Rose was borderline romantic, I was not expecting another woman to come along and illicit such feelings from our favorite Time Lord. Sophia Myles as the Madame is truly inspired casting. She embodied what I would imagine the genesis of the Seven Years' War to be. While each episode that I have viewed thus far is quite memorable, for the quips, for the action, or for the revelations, I felt that this was the episode that truly made me feel for the Doctor. I found the episode The Satan Pit to also be immensely satisfying. It's not that there were major revelations in the episode, I just felt the mythology was well handled.  [spoiler](/s ""I don't find myself terribly affected by the departure of Rose, since I'm wholly aware that she will return.  I do not know how, when, where, or why, but I know she will return."")

So far, just two seasons in, I wholly understand the allure of this show. It is engaging, entertaining, emotional, and provocative all in one. There are plenty more adjectives I could throw around, but I'm sure you've all used them before.

Just wanted to post to say thank you to the people in r/doctorwho - if it were not for you folks and your fervent love of this series, I would have been lost in a sea of mythology and speculation.  I find it immensely more entertaining to read through posts here (while dodging spoilers, of course!) than it is to troll through wikipedia entries.  

I am preparing to start season 3, in hopes of seeing the Face of Boh again (I didn't forget the promise he made) as well as other familiar characters.  I know of the existence of The Master, and what [race] he is, but I made sure to avoid knowing who he is (I imagine this makes sense.)",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Two seasons in to Series 5 (spoilers for that period?),12,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/l37fd/two_seasons_in_to_series_5_spoilers_for_that/

I usually like to do the thing proper and watch every previous episode of a show if I jump in late, for example I didn't get into House M.D. until the fifth season, but I watched every episode season 1-4 before I watched the current shows.

Usually I do this without hesitance, but [holy crap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) Doctor Who has been running a while!

I need some advice from people who love the show, where should I begin? I understand there was a long gap up until 2005, would Season 1 (2005) be a good place to start? I understand some doctors have been better than others, should I start later? Should I go back to 1963 and watch all 783?

Sorry ahead of time.

So while I'm not all that high on Steven Moffat's run on Series 5 and 6, I'll give him his due for possibly creating an inadvertent way of bringing back the old Doctors for a two/three-parter story arc. Here's my basic idea:

In the next Series, 7, a new Villain takes center stage for an episode. A prolific scientist who's own morals somewhat oppose The Doctor's own beliefs and is in search of having his work stand through the test of time like every great artist, composer, etc. Have something eerie also happen in the general vicinity of this scientist while The Doctor is around (like a village for example) such as disappearances of people. Reveal that it's the scientist using them to for experiments on how to extract their own life force and transfer it to himself so he can become immortal thus accomplishing his feat of being able to live forever to always press his work onto the universe/change the universe's lifespans, etc.

In the end, The Doctor knows this would unravel civilizations and possibly create another ""God-like race"" because they can't die and need to kill other beings to extract their life as their own. The Doctor blows up the scientist's lab as the scientist refuses to leave his work begging the Doctor not to hurting him in the process while he claws at him for aid, but subsequently dying in the explosion as The Doctor escapes yelling for him to do the same. Afterwards he's saddened by the loss of such a great mind that had fallen to dark temptations somewhat like the Time Lords.


And now here's where the 50th Anniversary's plot comes in (I'll be brief now):

Have this scientist return and reveal that some of his work had been based off the Gangers from Series 6. And that this scientist is, too, a Ganger version who has found a device to stabilize him into a living being (like the TARDIS is able to do) in the form of a small gun or the like. Have him also reveal that from the few moments he was ""hurting"" The Doctor he actually ripped a piece of his hair out and had stuffed it in his mouth, luckily surviving the explosion inside the charred remains of his original body.

The scientist breaks down the hair's molecular structure and is able to find trace amounts of every previous incarnation of The Doctor and uses each trace amount to create Ganger versions of previous Doctors to combat The Eleventh. However some do not have enough DNA to become Gangers (the actors who've passed away) and others who did survive weren't recreated perfectly (showing the age of the actors still alive).

This could also lead to the Fields of Transalore that Dorium spoke about where The Eleventh encounters his past selves and recalls a serious plot point from each of their respective time and breaks through to each of them, turning on the scientist in the end however the Eleventh being shot in the process. The Eleventh can then find the device used to stabilize the Ganger Doctors, but they all say for him not to and instead use his Sonic to dissolve them so they become the goo that can't be used for any other nefarious plot like this again. The Eleventh can then use his Sonic while recalling another fond memory from each before they all disappear, and then turns to reveal he's a Ganger too that the real Doctor used to assure he'd live through it. The Doctor dissolves the Eleventh Ganger and puts the final period of ""The Fall of the Eleventh"" mystery too.

She technically was drugged, kidnapped, stuffed into an astronaut suit that was acting against her will. She didn't want to kill the Doctor.

She shouldn't have to go to jail to make the Silence think the Doctor is dead. The fact that people believe the Doctor died was apparently the fixed point.

She shouldn't need to go into detail about the silents. The Doctor escaping his fate is totally unnecessary to her defense.

The Silents do not make their own technology, they use lesser species' technology; so in a future court, a half-wit lawyer should be able to show that the suit was capable of being controlled by an outside force. 

Why kill someone in a big bulky suit, when she could have without the suit and why use a suit that can be controlled by an outside force?Which in theory could have been used to stop her or force her to do the bidding of her controller...

Although it is likely that people would have a hard time believing in the Silence, that a lawyer could at least enter a reasonable amount of doubt into a court room to keep River out of jail. 

The only arguments I can see are:

* River wants to be in jail for another reason.

* River is in jail for *another* murder.

* River's jail time is a fixed point.

* Future courts do not work like a US-based court and assume the guilt and not innocence. Even then, it would seem that if people knew this technology was available and a lawyer entered it into a court case, enough doubt could be generated.

I read a post here on reddit made by a Brit concerning minimum wage. He said something along the lines of ""Bitching about minimum wage is a very North American thing to do. Anywhere else (including the UK) you can easily live off of minimum wage.""

Minimum wage is pretty bad here in the states. Not sure how our frozen brothers to the north feel about their minimum wage though. To be fair, you can live off of our minimum wage. But its not really living, its more like survival lol You can maybe get a room at a boarding house and eat bland noodles every day. Its just a step up from being homeless and destitute. Youre not going to be able to afford any luxuries at all though. 

So I guess my question for you kind Brits (or anyone in the greater UK area) is how do you feel about your minimum wage. Whats the quality of life of a person living on min wage? The post I read made it sound like min wage allots you a decent living in England. Maybe it was exaggerated or peppered with a hint of patriotism, I don't know. I'm generally seeking some facts and opinions for anyone who cares to answer.  

I thank you all for your time and for having read this. I hope this is an ok topic to post on this subreddit. I would have posted it in r/askreddit but I wanted to direct it specifically to you fine folks.

So here's a tip.

As you drive past a smaller road that joins the main road, look to see if it has a 30mph speed limit sign at the entrance.
If it doesn't, then you're already in a 30mph zone. If it does, there's every likelihood that you're in a 40mph zone.
Of course, there are going to be the odd exception (20/50 zones, etc), but if in doubt, stick to 30 until you're sure, and you should be ok.

I really don't want to go with BT. I've heard so many horror stories about their fair use policies and traffic shaping that it sounds like they're a real problem. Plus an 18 month contract is a bit steep.

We haven't seen the Doctor share his name with her (inb4- he said it at the wedding, because he didn't I see this confusion in comments a lot. so I'm just getting that out there.) The doctor's future, leads into River's past. So if she doesn't know it at the point of her wedding, she doesn't learn it later as the doctor encounters her. She had to have learned it in between the wedding, and her death, which from our POV we have already passed up without witnessing. 

I kind of feel like drawing a diagram, does anyone else like diagrams? But I think you get what I'm saying, I imagine you just nodded a stifled nod. Perhaps you did then if you hadn't..

Back to what I was saying, River knows the doctors name, and she learned it earlier in the seasons she's been around for than now... But this brings me to the even more basic conceptual trial I have with the direction in time River flows (heh.) versus the doctor. How? What? and WHAT?!? They are time travelers, not Benjamin Button. So it's not that they are naturally proceeding in the other direction of each other, by traveling in time, one transcends it's natural order. So Why aren't they (or her being the backwards one.) going in a more proper direction? I understand that with her mucking in her own past, she can't actually occupy those instances again herself (as not to cross her own timeline)... But still why not sometimes meet in meta-timeline events, anywhere but the past. Time Lord Council intervention is what I would say if this were in the classic era (pre-timewar) they have very cruel mental manipulation technologies, and an interesting take on the death penalty. I obviously won't figure this one out today I suppose. But how about you guys weigh in on that.

One of the things I always enjoyed about Doctor Who was the constant change.

When the series rebooted in 2005, I was at first disappointed. Not in the show itself, but because every single episode featured Earth in some way. And if it wasn't Earth it was New New Earth or some planet or star base with human descendants. 

I missed the old Doctor's way of traveling the universe and visiting planets and people that had little or nothing to do with Earth. 

But this is a new day (and sets and costumes are very expensive), so I settled down a bit. But at least we got to see the comings and goings of some fairly cool people for the Doctor to hang out with. 

But now for the third year running we get more of Karen Gillan. She's not hard to look at, and she has a very strong, compelling character. Arguably she's the first companion that regularly stands up to the Doctor and that is a large part of the appeal.

Why? Iâd go with the fact that Moffatt is trying really hard to GET me to like her...and is going about this in the entirely wrong way. Iâm pretty sure he doesnât really know how to write female characters very well (perhaps with the exception of Sally Sparrow), because what he thinks is a strong female character is completely obnoxious without any flaws that are her own fault. (Before you ask, I did have some similar problems with Amy Pond, but I've grown to tolerate her after series six is over.

""River Song is badass! And cool! And a perfect shot! And knows everything! And has lotsa sex! And kills people! The Daleks are afraid of her for no real reason even though they are rather defiant to the being theyâve come to refer to as The Oncoming Storm! Wasnât that line about gay gypsy bar mitzvahs for the disabled badass and cool? Hahahahaha wildly jerks off while making a sonic screwdriver noise and says âhello sweetieâ during orgasm""

Give me a fucking break.

A few people have refuted the problem that I and many others have with Moffattâs tenure as head writer thus far in that he uses a massive inscrutable overarching plot in lieu of an actually engaging story to keep an audience with the fact that Classic Who also used an entire series of episodes to tell one story. This argument can be easily shot down in flames with the fact that the two eras are completely incommensurable due to the fact that the old episodes of the Classic Who serials are like, 20 minutes long each So what it comes down to is I guess Steven Moffatt doesnât trust really trust his audience to just watch the show because itâs good.. And I wouldnât mind that if the way that he tied up all the loose ends at the end of each series wasnât so hackneyed. The deus ex machinas here put J.K. Rowling to shame, honestly: He keeps painting himself into a corner and deciding the only way to deal with it is fly out of the room with a jetpack.
Which technically works but youâre still an asshole with a jetpack.
Resetting time so nothing ever happened but you still remember it happening or conveniently befriending a group of people travelling around in a ship that can fashion itself to look like anyone you want is not good storytelling; itâs a cop out.
(I'm going to stop before I get too cranky.)

Hartnell would currently be 103, Smith is 28. So that's a 75 year age gap and apart from 3rd, 5th n 6th it's been a drop in age all along his regenerations. (Nearly 20 years younger this past 6 years) The show has being running for 48 years.

So tell me this r/doctorwho; has the Doctor gotten younger by a flat 75 years, 27 years (75 years of de-aging minus 48 years of aging), or younger by 123 years(48 years of no aging plus 75 years of getting younger).

So I was just wondering if anyone on here had any advice for future shops, ideally from those who do this sort of thing regularly. One of my biggest problems is trying to balance the shop so I don't let things go out of date before I use them (E.g. ordering veg but not having the actual meal until the end of the week etc)

I was wondering if any one has any entertaining ones as I do. I'll share one of mine. 
I was wandering at night as I often do with the sonic I made my self (it has a light and some noises that resonate from it) and I spied a woman walking towards me dressed oddly (as I was I get pretty much all of my fashion tips from the different doctors as to what I wear day to day) and I pull out the sonic point it at her change the pitch of the noise and turn it on thinking she may be a Doctor Who fan. She stopped and stood there staring at me and said ""Doctor?"" to which I responded ""Fred?"" There were people around so we came up to eachother as if it was nothing the conversation went a bit like this. 
Her (imitating romana)""Ah doctor I see you've changed again""
Me (imitating Tom Baker)"" you too I see, I'm so sorry""
Her ""Oh? What for?""
Me "" Romana, for what must have happened for you to come back to this world""
Her "" Oh yes, the reversal of the neutron flow was abrupt but allowed""
Me ""Is any one else left?""
Her "" The skism closed as you absorbed the medusa cascade Doctor you know that"" 
Me (putting a jelly baby into my mouth) ""my god"" (falling to sit cross legged wrapped in a scarf and long coat on the brick walk way) 
her (sitting beside me) ""It's ok, you're forgiven you did as you had to.""
Me ""I will see you again soon right?""
Her "" Too soon"" (gives me a hug and walks away)

I stood up smiled and slid my hands into my pockets. My jelly babies were missing but I found a buisness card with her name and number. 
The reason I wrote this is because while most of you seem to celebrate your love of Who some seem to be just kind of embarrassed of it. To be honest I feel a bit more level headed because of the show. If travel broadens the mind Doctor Who has left the door wide open. The best people tend to be into Doctor Who, the ones who will just do something like the above story and I've met so many of you wonderful people and I just want to let out a thanks to the entire community for making the experience just as enjoyable as it is. Sorry if I appear to be rambling, I'm making perfect sense it's undenyable you're just not keeping up. Or you are... I'm going to go now things going on. Well, four things. Well three things and a lizard. I appologize if you've read this far shower me with your down votes, upvotes or stories.

The resolution on this copy is amazing. Hereâs a contrast with the Five Doctors and Mawdryn Undead: http://i.imgur.com/IdiM2.png Are all DVD copies as good as the Five Doctors, did the BBC get a new camera, or are all my other copies just bad ones?

Iâm grinning the whole way through this one. All the previous Doctors, (well Hurndall kind of weirds me out), the Brigadier, K-9! I think thatâs the same house Sarah Jane is seen near in End of Time.

**16 minutes in**: I canât get over the resolution! The TARDIS looks really fancy and cool now.

**23 minutes in**: Now I canât get over how *not* Hartnell Hurndall is. Itâs jarring. The second Doctorâs coat wouldnât be so silly if it didnât have that string at the waist.

**28 minutes in**: Hurndall: âGoodness me, itâs the TARDIS!â and I say, âBut thatâs not *your* TARDIS! The St. Peters emblem isnât on the door!â. Ming mong.

**33 minutes**: Woah. Itâs Gallifrey AND itâs not a BBC quarry. Oh and of course the 4th isnât in this. What is with Tom Baker and not wanting to appear in anything past his original run? I hear he didnât want to do the audios because the stories were bad.

**40 minutes**: Whatâs up with the outfits in this story? Sarah Jane looks silly and 2 and 3 have these coats on. I think 3âs got one because Pertweeâs a little rounder, eh? Cybermenâs voices? Awesome. Hurndallâs legs and coat are so long...

**46 minutes**: Button your jacket three. Finally get to see the burgundy beauty and itâs not buttoned! Oh dear that weird silver robot thing. It was in Destiny of the Daleks wasnât it? Itâs silly. âAnd kindly refrain from addressing me as Doc!â Love it. Hurndall youâre now my Doctor as well.

**55 minutes**: âWhat? No, not the mind probe!â  HA. ...That cave has a waterfall- wonder where theyâre shooting this. How did they get that door in that cave? 3 and Sarah Jane are still stuck with the robot. I didnât realize the story was moving so slowly. Iâm having too much fun. Nice headshot on the Cybermen! Love the Dalek blowing up btw. Is Pertwee wearing a *cumberbund*?? I think thatâs what theyâre called. Facepalm. Did Sarah Jane just try and throw a rock at the Cybermen?! Oh dear. And did Pertwee just lasso the tower from over a hundred feet away?? Oh man. Major facepalming. Love the tower architecture though.

**65 minutes**: Awesome door design. Sheep across minefields. Great line. Easy as 3.14159265! Love that- one of the few things I remember about this story. The tower reminds me of Lord of the Rings. Man, I really wish Pertwee would take that plaid thing off.  Really liking Hurndall. He does well with Tegan. This is very ârunning through corridorsâ but hey itâs good.

**75 minutes**: Jamie! Wow I canât believe so many actors have come back. Musical harp? Brilliant. For a second I thought five was going to play the theme music. I canâtâ believe that rock is full of Greek letters. Really? *Thatâs* high Gallifreyan? 

Oh I knew it was the President! Wait...Borusa can retire? I thought Presidency was for life? HA. Wait til I tell this one guy at the reddit forums! I have to roll my eyes at how many ___s of Rassilon there are.

Oh my god the missing face on the tomb side is part of the plot! Those moving eyes are so creepy. I love how the older âor should I say younger- Doctors criticize five and the way five drops the presidency.

**AND DONE**. What a great story! How did I not remember it so? Well that probably tops my count on overusage of the exclamation mark (edited down). Most of the things I wrote here are momentary thoughts, so any criticisms I may have made are totally invalid.

As a whole I can say this was fantastic- especially for the long term fan who knows classic. Needless to say, this made a lot more sense the second time around. The plot may have been a little slow in the middle with the random villains and death zone, but thatâs expected with so many story lines to juggle. There were lots of clever ideas and witty dialogue in this, especially loved seeing all the past companions. Iâm surprised that I warmed to Hurndall so fast as well.

**Some great lines**: About the Master: âOut of the question!â âYouâre hardly a suitable candidate.â âFor anything.â OR âI wear the Coronet of Rassilon!â  âAnd very fetching it is too.â This story is just full of great one liners. AND âGood bye. Fancy pants!â

This Tuesday October 11th, the bfi are previewing the first episode of Misfits S3. The screening will be followed by a panel and Q&amp;A with members of the cast and crew.

&gt;We are pleased to announce that joining us for the discussion and Q&amp;A will be Howard Overman (creator and lead writer) and cast members Joseph Gilgun, Iwan Rheon, Lauren Socha and Nathan Stewart-Jarrett. The host will be broadcaster Matt Edmondson.

I bought two tickets and then my friend decided he didn't want to go (muppet). So I decided this was a job for reddit!

The screening starts at 6.20 at the bfi Southbank and the tickets are back row centre. If you'd like my spare ticket, just tell me what ironic superpower the Universe would give you and why. I'll let the winner know by 6.30pm Monday 10th October.

Good luck!

unless its in a shitty area, which is usually for small orders.
the tightest people are the middle classes who order meals for two usually with sides and then hold out their hands to get back the ten pence change theyre due. thanks shit head you just tipped Â£3.00 while displaying your shit eating grin cos you think you won.""

So basically my parents never tipped when I was a kid and neither do I or any of my friends nowadays, what is the consensus on tipping delivery drivers here? Am I in an arsehole demographic or does this guy have it wrong? :s

(Ala bad wolf, the planets missing, the bees, vote saxon, etc.)

Moffat started his time as head writer doing something like this with the cracks in time, and pulls it off with only one small blip. (Time of Angels/flesh and stone were rather main-plot heavy)  The season ended with pretty much the same sort of format that RTD used: introduce some sort of clue thing that appears (Often briefly) in pretty much every episode, finally explain/deal with it in the finale.

Season 6 starts off with this in Amy seeing Madame Kovarian every episode, but that gets dropped very quickly and the entire second half of the season is devoid of recurring clues altogether.

Here's what I'm thinking: There are clues, but they're spaced to lead up to a finale for the eleventh doctor. (or perhaps the fiftieth anniversary, or something?)

The clues I think fit the best are the symbols of the Silence. (The ones on the church uniforms that look like an omega with some extra lines in the middle) It's been said before that they're suggestive of Omega, and given the Lungbarrow stuff with Omega, Rassilion and the Other being tied together and the Doctor being the Other, it strikes me as too much of a coincidence that Moffat's plot for next season appears to be about the Doctor's identity, especially given how closely he could tie this to the Other and Omega if he wanted to.

Turns out every set is a fake.  Not just a fake, mind you, but a high production value fake.  The boxes are machine printed, the disks are stamped and silkscreen printed, and some (not all) come with requisite promotional material.  

However, when I load the disks using a computer and examine the format, they are all-region disks that are single-sided, single layer.  Official disks (in the US, where I live anyway) would be region 1 and DVD9 (single-sided, dual layer).  The volume labels were odd as well, with most disks being labeled ""LP,"" some misspelling Doctor (""DOCTOER""), and some we're labelled things that made no sense at all (one of my disks was labelled ""THE NURSES LINE"").

The printing on the disks themselves are rife with errors that you wouldn't spot unless you're looking closely (interesting how our eyes see what we expect to see).  The worst I've found so far is the second-to-last disk of series three, which apparently has a single episode called ""The Sound of the Drums Kast of the Time Loros.""  

I've noted that a few friends have been scammed by these bootlegs even when buying from Amazon.  Series 5 is available on Amazon only from a 3rd party seller, for example.

Does anyone have a comprehensive list of how to spot these fakes before you buy?  Should we start one?

Here are a few references I've found:

But once characters *within the Whoniverse* begin referring to him as the eleventh, then that implies that he is the eleventh regeneration of the Doctor since he was *born*.

Why do we have any reason to believe this? Why do we assume that the regeneration played by William Hartnell was the first? Not a regeneration at all, but the ""real"" Doctor? This seems an absurd assumption to make. After all, wasn't he already hundreds of years old? Hadn't he already been on many dangerous adventures? And when the William Hartnell Doctor dies, doesn't he say something to imply that he has undergone the process of regeneration before? Something along the lines of ""This body is old and tired and it's time for a new one""?

I think it's a mistake for Doctor Who writers to insert lines into their scripts that establish that ""Eleven"" is in fact the eleventh. It seems far richer dramatically to at least allow for the possibility that there were countless past regenerations who we never met because they lived before the show began. Imagine travelling back in time to meet one of them! Or seeing one in a flashback sequence that ties in directly with the current events of the show! Or one of them showing up in our current Doctor's timeline! Imagine if for some reason the current Doctor didn't *remember* his older regeneration, and it turned out to be somebody we've already met! (This is actually my pet theory for the true identity of River Song.) 

I know there's this whole ""regeneration limit"" thing, but haven't the writers already found a way around that? I mean, out of all the things that can be retconned, that seems like the easiest.

Starting with *An Unearthly Child,* *Doctor Who* kickstarted a revolution that, to this day, is still on a rampage. In the event you haven't caught up with it, [here](http://www.crossingthewhoniverse.com/An-Unearthly-Child.html) is the titular episode.

Going through it again, I've seen that, compared to the recent episodes, there's a bit of an effort to make yourself get involved, as there's the culture shock, in a sense. You're transcending 38 years of television and technology and attempting to displace yourself.

Overall, as a first episode, it doesn't pull the viewer in like I went in expecting; it was a gentle, slightly swaying ride. It seemed like it was trying to keep the science to a minimum, but maybe that's the time difference? Also, something I've noticed: the Doctor and his granddaughter Susan, as portrayed by the lovely Carol Ann Ford, never leave Earth during this episode/these episodes. 

The TARDIS, almost a full-out character in recent incarnations of the Doctor, is quintessentially described as an ""automobile"" or another piece of random equipment that the Doctor and Susan utilize to get around. Of course, as a fledgling television show, it's impossible to jam-pack a lot of heavy information and/or hints about a time machine into something that short (and I use the term ""short"" describing the length of the serial very lightly) without pushing the importance of the main, human characters Ian and Barbara into the background as screaming children.

Overall, it was a simple story, executed quite well in my opinion, and easy as a first episode. It established the basis of what would become a treasured television show for millions, while implementing cheesy effects elaborately and effectively.

I give this first serial, *An Unearthly Child*, a 7.5 out of 10.

I'm a Norwegian taking an obligatory English course in Denmark, an we recently had a written assignment in which we were to discuss British identity (apx 400 words). I wrote a text that I found to be be both witty and answering the questions in the assignment.

But when I got it back, I had nearly flunked, and the class instructor called my text hateful and patronizing, as well as not answering the questions at all. Alas, she did not get my humor. Of course, this has left me doubting if it really is a bad text, or if anyone else get it.

So, my questions to you Britons would be:
In the context, do you find this text offensive?
Do you find it witty?
Does the text, in your opinion, answer the questions in the assignment?
 
Thanks for any response.

Assignment + Text here: http://pastebin.com/9AY3dRgT


EDIT: Thank you for all your responses guys and gals. Reading through your comments I've so far come to some conclusions about the text;

+ A bit over the edge to be funny

+ I should show some more love in between the lines to clarify that I'm joking

+ The satirical take on national identity works best when addressing ones own nationality

+ At least one genuine Brit (Hidas462) find it funny

+ At least one genuine Brit (dumbkid) pointed out that if I pull that sh*t in Britain I'll get my head smashed in

+ I didn't really answer the questions in the assignment


Thanks again for taking the time to read the text, and I find your responses to be much more useful than what I got from the instructor. And know that I did it all out of love ;)

EDIT 2: Just to clarify, as some people seem to take this as a real shot at insulting you Brits; this is not an attempt to offend you. Think of it more as the drunk best mans attempt at holding a funny speech in a wedding... or something in that direction anyways. It's not meant to hurt you in a personal way, and I'm sorry if i have insulted anyone in such an manner, e.g. having relatives or friends who fought in the Falkland wars etc. I'm just trying to get a grip of why I personally find it so funny and innocent, and my teacher and others find way over the edge. And I wouldn't have posted it here in /r/unitedkingdom if I didn't mean it in the best of all ways, and because I believe that you Brits can take being ridiculed by a foreigner (even if in an awkward manner) and still being able to have a laugh about it afterwards.

So that's the spec, but as a bit more about the job and company. We're a mid-sized gaming (casino, poker, etc) company based in London. Fully licensed and regulated, so you're not going to get stopped trying to get into America or anything. An interest in poker and gambling is a bonus, but we've trained up people with no previous knowledge before, so don't let that put you off.

At the moment we have about 6 or so customer support agents, but they're based in Romania. As for how that came about; we used to have a similarly sized team here but it become viable for us to move to Romania because one of our agents was Romanian, plus we had a Romanian country manager who have become our Customer Service Manager and Eastern European Regional Manager respectively. Other members of the team have become an accounts assistant here (training towards becoming a full accountant), our CRM manager, our VIP manager and our previous support manager is now Head of Operations. That's all happened inside 2-3 years.

We're looking to have support for the Danish market once it regulates at the start of next year and, if it all goes well, there will be ample room for growth and development. I'm not trying to sell you on another job, this is a customer support agent role, but just saying we're small enough that those with a flair for marketing or development are recognised.

You'll be based here in London, at the far end of Hammersmith (pretty much Chiswick), Stamford Brook stop, but any other questions just ask.

Anyway, my question is about Gallifrey and the ""last great time war"". I get that the doctor is supposedly the last of the time lords (along with the Master), and that he can't travel back into the time war because it's apparently time-locked. But what's keeping him from traveling back to Gallifrey in the time *before* the war? 

And for that matter, why is the universe not scattered with time lords from before the time war?

So here it goes -

I'm trying to help my pal find a job. He's 22 and lives in Wiltshire, UK, and it's been pretty tough for him finding working on which he can make a living. He used to live in a shared flat as of a year ago, but was forced to move back home with his parents as his last job was seasonal and his room mate decided he didn't want to live there anymore. He's been down on his luck ever since, trying to fill in the gap of unemployment with volunteering at his local wildlife trust.

He recently took on a week-long trial for a goldsmith apprenticeship, and was let down in a big way when they declined him the position for someone they could hire for cheaper, even after telling him to make moving arrangements for employment with them. While he was away for the trial week, he was robbed of his phone, cash, amongst other things. Obviously it hasn't made his life any easier. On top of all of this he has some very steep bills to pay.

He's a great guy who desperately needs a break. It's his birthday soon, and I know the prospect of some interviews would really be a great gift to give him.

I don't know if there's anybody out there who can help, but any advice would be much appreciated.

Long time lurker, first time I have made an account

Been thinking of relocating for a while now and finally made the choice My criteria were (1) Good music scene (2) English is the spoken language (3) Job possibilitys with organic food (4) Proximity to nature (5) availability of affordable housing. Seems like Bristol is ideal, got a lot of friends in London but dont think I could live there!

Based in the netherlands at the moment so trying to set up everything online and have a few questions for people on the ground before i book the flight...

What are my chances of walking straight into a job?

(Have 6 years experience running a small kitchen (no diploma) but am open to any kind of work as long as it will cover the bills)

I see a lot of places on gumtree list rent per week, Im assuming that I will have to pay monthly?

(Wont have a huge amount of cash when I land so paying the deposit + a weeks rent would be less scary than having to hand over almost everything at first and hoping for the best)

Are wages generally paid weekly or monthly?
And if monthly is there a month in advance thing ie.. could i potentially be waiting 2 months to get paid?

Is Easton the best choice?

(I do like the idea of a diverse community but have read some negative stuff. Would be good if somebody who knows the area could chime in :)

Basically, make him defeat himself. To elaborate, make him complete some action in concurrence with your plan such that he would have to undo his own actions to undo your plot.

To elaborate on season 5, this actually is where I assumed the series was going at the end of S5, the silence had trapped the doctor into rewriting/rebooting the universe using the pandorica. A devide which they undoubtedly had a hand in creating (due to its relation to the silence, âthe pandorica will open, silence will fallâ) or which at least they were around during its creation. Therefore when the doctor rebooted the universe with the molecules inside the pandorica (TBB) I assumed the molecules had been edited in some way to create a universe that fit with the silenceâs plan. Heck this would even explain why not just seeing the silence, but the image of the silence would have the same memory proof properties. The reaction of all organic beings to seeing the silence could be hardcoded into the universe. This even gives a benefit to the attempt to destroy the universe in TPO, the silence didnât want to destroy the universe, they wanted a universe that fit their plans better, and gave them a superpower. Who better to enact their plan than the one person who could stop it.

We know now that the silenceâs plan is something to do with âthe questionâ though we still donât know why the TARDIS explodes. However I think the seed of how to defeat the doctor has been planted. You canât beat the doctor, but the Doctor can.

Tl;dr- Force the Doctor to have to interfere in events he has already established or done himself in order to undo your evil plot, any other ideas?

**Edit:** I orginally said defeat the Doctor, but everybody seems to be looking to kill the Doctor :(
also the most popular suggestion seems to be ""shoot him when he poops"" . . . . . . .

All throughout this time, I always heard of Doctor Who from various reputable sources. After doing some research a few years back I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of doctors and seasons/series available and I was mostly at a loss as where to start. So for many years, I stayed outside the loop. However in recent times. I've noticed a larger gathering of adoration for the show amongst my friends. Also, the doctor began invading other shows and hobbies of mine with little cameos and references. To give you an idea, for about a week straight, a group of my sailing buddies would consistently cry out ""ALLONSY!"" (or however you spell it) whenever we made a sharp turn in the boats. Needless to say, I finally got fed up and decided to see what all the fuss was about. 

I REGRET NOTHING!
(although I do regret starting the night before a test, now I'm having trouble focusing on studying :P )

I began with the 2005 series 1 show (reboot possibly too? Not entirely sure) and I just finished the 1st 5 episodes. 

Needless to say, it's been a while since a show has been this much fun and entertaining. I love the doctors nonchalant way of dealing with many different situations and the vast imagination of the writers (I really enjoyed the 2nd episode and many of the deep thoughts on whether or not what we do now, will matter later). The comedy and the characters are pure gold and I love many of them, and when the show gets serious, I have no issue getting pulled in and getting serious as well. It's rare to have a story that does that these days. 

Anyway, enough rambling. I just wanted to state that I'm very happy in starting this show, and from the looks of things, the community seems like an amazing group of people as well. I might not be here too much for now though, just because I want to at least get a little more knowledge under my belt before diving in with the rest. I will work my way up to the current doctor from where I am now and maybe someday I'll go back to the classics if I have the time. 

THIS SHOW IS AWESOME!

:D

They're all really nice companies. One develops games, another is in the science sector and the third is a huge media group.

Careers events, advice and information from a society run by students. We aim to make your decision on a career path or first job/internship easier by letting you speak to the people who are vetting your applications, participate in workshops and mock assessment centres/interviews and a whole host of other things. First event will be the Friday week 2 (21st) at 6:30PM in P/T/005 (Next to the massive lecture theatre in Physics). Come along! You don't have to be studying a particular course, nor only be in final year. 

We'll have some fun icebreaker style games and a little more info on events/the society as a whole, with food and drink free.

All that said, I miss Rose. She was always genuinely excited to be with the Doctor, always genuinely excited to be on adventures either with 9 or 10, and she was a companion who HELPED instead of needing SAVING. Yes she occasionally needed saving, but nowhere near on the level that Amy has. Martha was great but too reboundey for me, and I never was a big fan of Donna (I know, I know, she's polarizing).

I'm just tired of the doctor constantly putting his companions in jeopardy only to barely save them, instead of going on adventures with his companions, and getting their help to do whats needs doing.

In the first episode with River, it is shown that River knows the doctor's name and that 'there's only one reason anybody would ever know my name'. Im not quite sure WHY this is, but albeit she does know his name.
We also know that the only other people who have been able to fly the TARDIS have been the master and River, both know the Doctor's name.
But why is this relevant? -Well, at the end of series 5 we see the TARDIS exploding (with River inside) and we are not quite sure why. The silence is an order that believe the prophesy, that when the oldest question in the universe is asked, silence will (or must) fall. As the Doctor is predestined to answer the question, when the silence find out (by controlling river) they can control the TARDIS.
We already know the question is Doctor Who? and the answer is his name. In the ending of series 5 the silence find out his name and manage to control the TARDIS, destroying it in doing so.
Anything im missing?

Edit: Okay i've missed a lot out.

A historical is a story which takes place in Earth's past in which, aside from the Doctor and his TARDIS, there are no science fiction elements. Examples of historicals include The Aztecs, Marco Polo, The Romans, and many other Hartnell stories. A pseudo-historical however, is a story which takes place in Earth's past in which science fiction is involved. Examples of these include The Unicorn and the Wasp, The Idiot's Lantern, and Victory of the Daleks.

So I was thinking, why label the past episodes as historicals, but not label the future episode as futuristics? A pure futuristic would focus on humanity's future. These would include stories such as Gridlock, The Long Game, Midnight, and The Waters of Mars. On the other side, a pseudo-futuristic would be a story in which science fiction elements are present, but the story does not focus on humanity. These would include The Daleks, The Girl Who Waited, and The Web Planet.

Just found out that a BBC News report earlier today showed footage from inside Jo Yeates' flat. Apparently ITV did too so I assume it was many news channels. The BBC report [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-15261783) gives quite a few details of ""What the jury saw"" including various irrelevant items (""A Red Dwarf DVD... hair straighteners"").

Is it really necessary that the public is told what the jury saw? Did we need to know all of that?

I could go on to muse on this being an extension of [Missing White Woman Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_white_woman_syndrome): How often is the public afforded this level of coverage?

I might be overreacting. All last year I felt like wandering up and down that road with a sign saying ""What are you looking at, exactly?"" Ok, *that* would have been going too far.

Does anyone remember the dark times between 1989 and 2005 (not counting the TVM) when all DW fans had were videos and later DVD's or repeats on TV stations like UK Gold for their DW fix.

Granted it's a long time until Autumn 2012 when Series 7 starts but it's not the almost 20 years it was between the airing of ""Survival"" and the resurrection of the show with ""Rose"" but I can imagine a lot of us are suffering without our Saturday night fix of all things TARDIS-y.

A thought occurred to me as to why the BBC, who obviously own the rights to all the episodes, do not show any repeats of complete seriels from the 60's/70's/80's... even if it was on a Sunday night on BBC 4 at 3am.. in this world of Tivo and Sky Plus airing times no longer matter.

I understand that DVD sales and other matters may affect as to why the BBC doesn't do this but it just seems odd that the show, which is the most popular it has ever been, isn't more visible on our screens during the ""down time"" between series. Hell we don't even get repeats of the revived show never mind some quality Davison, McCoy or Baker (both of them!) 

There's also the official BBC DW YouTube channel which has some classic DW but it's not been updated in who knows how long... it's be nice if there was some show rotation.

Did every other episode in the season really need to be a 2 part episode with no resolution? 


Out of 13 episodes, 6 episodes were part of a two part episode. Meaning 3 episodes ended with 'to be continued'. Including the finale, 7 episodes in this season were about the same story.



Amy gets pregnant. Amy is kidnapped by Silence and replaced by flesh. Flesh dies, Amy has baby. Silence kidnaps baby. Baby is River Song. River Song is destined to kill the Doctor. River Song doesn't kill the Doctor. Time starts disintegrating. Doctor fixes time.

BAM! Done.


Everything else was convoluted nonsense that was totally unnecessary to the actual story line.

How about answering 'the question' or why the TARDIS blew up last season or any of the other more interesting plot points brought up throughout the season?


I love Matt Smith but Steven Moffat is seriously ruining my life. It's indecent.


Edit: To all you trigger happy down voters out there, I really have to ask. Is this really not relevant to the conversation? Which is what I thought the purpose of the down vote was? All the Moffat love out there has to have it's balloon popped sometime. I know most of you guys started watching with Matt Smith and I love him but do none of you really think it's worth discussing possible faults/annoyances in Moffats writing? C'mon people!

Edit: Refer to comments below for a more detailed analysis.

TLDR: It feels like Steven Moffat is turning Doctor Who into a soap opera. Discuss.

Reg stirred himself from thought. ""No worse than many that exist already,"" he said.

It's like a human body, you see. A few cuts and bruises here and there don't hurt it. Not even major surgery if its done properly. Paradoxes are just the scar tissue. Time and space heal themselves up around them and people simply remember a version of events which makes as much sense as they require it to make.
That isn't to say if you get involved in a paradox a few things won't strike you as being very odd, but if you've got through life without that already happening to you, then I don't know which universe you've been living in, but it isn't this one.""",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,What Douglas Adams has to say about paradoxes....,166,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/lb4od/what_douglas_adams_has_to_say_about_paradoxes/

At the peak there was approximately 15 people, and there was a nice mixture of people present, in terms of age, gender, and nationality.

I was, briefly table-king, until I was [taken down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCq_Z1sQ9W8).

During the course of the night there were several topics of conversation raised which I noticed:

  * The next [rollergirl bout is 29th October](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=134105243356824).
  * The ratio of Canon to non-Canon shooters was 3:1.
       - If you like photography then [/r/photoclass](/r/photoclass) will be a useful resource..
       - If you want to pose then [I do portraits](http://edinburgh-portraits.com) - and provide cake if you're patient.
  * If you'd like to read about the [Waters of leith](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Water_of_Leith_Walkway) then please do so.  Better still come to Leith and walk it with me.
  * Dragon Tattoos are surprisingly common, though [Tolkien Tattoos](http://www.girlgonegeekblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/01.jpg) are obviously the best - especially if they're [upcoming](http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10794-L.jpg).
  * [Internet dating is hilarious](http://www.abadcaseofthedates.com/).  We can do better, ourselves.  And people have [odd dealbreakers](https://imgur.com/HoEQY) - [apparently](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/laq5t/fuck_that_part_of_a_crap_article_on_dating/)
  * The optical illusion I'm shooting over the weekend is [known as Rubin's vase](http://www.optical-illusionist.com/illusions/rubin-vase-illusion) - and even now I've never seen it done with real people, just identical drawings.
  * I didn't really threaten to strangle anybody.  You imagined it.
  * Hair is good, on other people.
  * The English language is hard, but [less vs. fewer](http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/less-versus-fewer.aspx) is simples; tis all about the sets, baby.
  * [The Balvenie](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Balvenie) is clearly the world's best whisky.

I also learned valuable information on my lonely walk home (happily _my_ route home was downhill all the way) - the Turkish kebab shop doesn't shut until 1AM on a Thursday.

My favorite picture of the night was:

  * [This one](http://i.imgur.com/KNfgv.jpg) - You're __paranoid__, you probably think I meant you, huh?

Next time somebody else can choose the venue and starting/finishing time.  You don't have to go, but you [can't stay here](http://i.imgur.com/89iXm.jpg).

- Well, as far as I know the laws regarding monitoring employee's emails are still a bit...

(I think for a second and can't find a decent portuguese term to convey my idea, so I go ahead and say...) 

- Wibbly-Wobbly

(Three seconds of the customer staring at me like I'm crazy, and then he says)

- Timey-Wimey?

We share a laugh, the meeting continues, and after that we go grap a cup of coffee. He tells me he's halfway thru 11's first season. 

I've ask him if he have ever seen any episodes from 1st thry 7th. He says no. So I whip out my 1TB external HDD with all the episodes and hand it to him. All in all a pretty awesome meeting.

The text of Dr Fox's letter:
 
Dear David, 
 
As you know, I have always placed a great deal of importance on accountability and responsibility. As I said on the Pepsi Chart Show last Sunday, I mistakenly allowed the distinction between my personal interest and the Top 40 to become blurred. The consequences of this have become clearer in recent days. I am very sorry for this.
 
I have also repeatedly said that the national interest in the weekâs singles sales must always come before personal interest. I now have to hold myself to my own standard. I have therefore decided, with great sadness, to resign from my post as host of the Pepsi Chart Showâa position which I have been immensely proud and honoured to have held.
 
I am particularly proud to have overseen number ones by Daniel Bedingfield and Las Ketchup. Their bravery, dedication and professionalism are second to none.
 
I appreciate all the support you have given me â and will continue to soothe the nation with my mellow Magic breakfast show, providing a soothing alternative to that enormous bellend on Radio 1, who is a threat not just to this countryâs prosperity but also to its national sanity.
 
I look forward to continuing to represent my listeners on digital DAB.
 
Yours ever,

Arguably our biggest game of the season thus far.

It's hard to pick a team this week for many reasons.There's a temptation to take Carroll out and play a 4-5-1 with Kuyt and Downing pushing high. I feel that now there is an opening in the England Euro squad, Carroll may grab that extra incentive to up his game. Gerrard should squeeze back in, but Adam had two extremely impressive games for Scotland (he even made some great tackles) so who should he come back for? Downing had an absolute shocker v Everton, but hope he'll pull himself together.

Anyway, I'll go for;

----Carroll----Suarez----

Downing--Gerrard--Kuyt-

----------Lucas---------

Jose-Carra-Skrtl-Kelly

--------Reina-----------

Adam, Henderson, Bellamy all missing out.

Pretty attacking huh?

FAO: Mr. G. Lawrence, CEO.








Dear Mr. Lawrence,





In this world of constant criticism, I think itâs only fair to offer credit
where credit is due. Iâm someone who is quick to let a company know if I
feel that their service has slipped below what I would consider to be
satisfactory, and therefore when a company does something I feel is
exceptional, I like to let them know.





With that in mind, Iâd like to offer congratulations on the fact that my
bills have been delivered to my inbox, almost always on time, for the last
12 months. These bills have also been printed legibly, and, for the most
part, accurately.


Now, I realise that some people would feel that this is not an
âexceptionalâ service from a telecoms provider. In fact, some people would
think that this would form the very core of what they would consider
âbasicâ services from any network; but I am not one of those people.





You see, after my recent dealings with your Customer Service departments, I
think these are âexceptionalâ things that you have been doing. I think this
because, after dealing with these people and their breathtaking
incompetence for the last month, Iâm honestly astonished they are capable
of putting their own shoes on in the morning. The fact they remember to
present me with a bill every month is, in my humble opinion, nothing short
of a miracle.





Itâs also worth noting that, as a result of these recent dealings, your
Customer Service department has also made it to the very top of my âThings
That Infuriate Meâ list. This means they have now leapfrogged some long
standing members of the list, including: âDFS Salesâ, âBMW Driversâ, âCars
With âPowered By Fairydustâ Stickersâ, âTiny Dogsâ, âLocal Radioâ, âIkeaâ
and âMichael Winnerâ.





A proud achievement, Iâm sure.





Alas, I digress. Though I have to admit, after being on the receiving end
of Vodafoneâs circumlocutions, procrastinations, aberrations and random
meanderings for the past month, I feel that I have every right to digress a
little myself.





By now youâre probably wondering what your Customer Service colleagues
could have possibly done to infuriate me to the point of combustion. Surely
they canât have been so inept, so misleading, so magnificently incompetent
to warrant such a reaction?





I can assure you they have.





I first contacted your incompetent minions on the 22nd of September, to
inform them that I would be cancelling my contract under clause 11b of my
T&amp;Cs:





ââ¢ we increase your charges in the UK which has the effect of increasing
your total charges (based on your usage in any of the previous three
months) by more than 10% and you write to us before the increase applies;â





As my September bill would have been more than 10% higher had the new
charges been applied, I was entitled to cancel my contract.





Firstly, I was told that the 10% rule only applies if the cost of my price
plan increases by more than 10%. Now, I think we can both agree that this
was a little porkie I was told by your colleague, yes?





Secondly, I was told that the cost of the calls in question (0844 calls
increasing from 18p per min to 35p per min) would not affect me, as calls
to these numbers had always cost me 35p per min. Again, quite a big lie.





Finally, I was told that it would be the bill for the month after the new
charges take effect which would be used for calculation. Seriously, they
actually said this. If bullshit was music, Vodafone would have a brass
band.





After exasperating myself with these three exchanges of emails, I can only
assume that there are no underpants left in the Vodafone offices, as they
must, surely, have all caught fire by now.





Your staff have deliberately given me false information, to try and prevent
me from cancelling my contract.





Which has got my back up.





A bit.





So, my complaint is now being escalated to your office. Whilst I accept
that thereâs a good chance it will just sit, unread, on an oversized
mahogany desk for a while, I should make it clear that if I donât receive a
response within 3 working days I will simply pass the whole complaint on to
the ombudsman. So there.





I have taken legal advice regarding the wording of the T&amp;Cs, and they have
confirmed that I am correct in my understanding of the contract. They have
also told me that the misleading information given to me by your naughty
customer service staff is a direct breach of the Sales of Goods and
Services Act.





I therefore leave my complaint in your executive lap. Iâm sure, as CEO of a
company like Vodafone, youâre far too busy sharpening your horns to read
letters such as these anyway, so I will just say that I truly hope the
customer service staff who answered my emails bang their shins on low
tables whilst walking to the break room â which is clearly where they spend
most of their time.





Yours Exasperatedly,

One of the scenes that stuck with me is when Rita is talking to the doctor and she says something about being in hell and the doctor asks ""Your muslim"" and she responds ""Don't be scared"".

It gave me a good giggle but I also like the way Moffat handled it. Rather than make her a villain or cast her in a different light Moffat made her look like a human being.

I love how culturally diverse the show is, how it is happy to put all peoples regardless of their race or religion on there. Most shows only include minorities as sideshows and comic relief, Doctor Who is a hell of a lot more forward thinking about it.

I think this is something that the show doesn't get enough credit for. Yes the doctor is fun and the show is crazy and the adventures are brilliant but the human factor of the show is the most important.

NOTE: I am counting the 9th Doctor (Eccleston) as Series 1. However, feel free to post favorites from the original series!
***

**Series 1: ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances""** - Firstly, the creep factor in this episode is fantastic.  Having a small child as the ""bad guy"" was brilliant.  Second, this is the episode in which we first meet Captain Jack Harkness, who remains to this day my favorite character in the whole series.  


Finally, what really sealed it was the following line, delivered perfectly: ""Everybody lives, Rose. Just this once! EVERYBODY LIVES!!"" 


I shiver every time I think about it. 
***

**Series 2: ""The Girl in the Fireplace""** - There are many quality episodes in Season 2, and this one narrowly beat out Christmas Invasion in my eyes.  The impact that the Doctor had on Madame de Pompadour and the relationship they had was beautiful, as were the clockwork enemies. 


All in all, I was astounded by the creativity inherent in the concept. 
***

**Series 3: Blink** - I realize this is the cliche choice... but believe me it was NOT an easy decision.  Every episode of Season 3 was absolutely amazing.  The season ender with the Master, the episode with Shakespeare... it took me days of thought and many conversations with fellow fans to finally settle on this. 


The Weeping Angels are among the scariest enemies I have ever encountered. The fact that the Doctor is pulling all of the strings from decades earlier is also brilliant. 


Besides that, the writer managed to introduce us to a brand new set of characters, become emotionally invested in them, then left us ready to move on... all in one episode. The pacing of it is what really sealed the deal for me. 
***

**Series 4: Silence in the Library/Forest of the dead** - Aside from the fact that *Vashta Narada* may be the most badass name ever, I was again impressed by the creativity inherent in the episode. A library the size of a planet, created for and controlled by a little girl. 


As an added bonus, we get to meet River Song for the first time, a character who dramatically altered my perception of the Doctor. Before River, I never saw the Doctor as a sexual being. After all, up until this point he had kept a very careful physical distance from his companions. 
***

**Series 5: Vincent and the Doctor** - Again, not an easy choice. The idea that only a madman could see the enemy was certainly an interesting one, but what made the whole episode, in my eyes, is the point where the Doctor takes Van Gough to a modern-day museum and allowed him to see what his work had become. How people thought of him long after his death.  


For that scene alone, which left me tear-streaked and red-faced, this is my choice. 


***


I have yet to see Series 6, so that's that!
