It's brand new, still in the packaging. I have no idea what it cost/how much it's worth, but I'm willing to barter for anything LFC/football related. 

It fits a double bed and comes with 2 pillow cases. I can send a picture of it to anyone if they want, but the factory photo is linked below. Seems like it would be perfect for a young LFC fan!

There has to be an underlying reason; besides the fact we forked out a shitload of money on him, that is keeping his head above water and I figured worldwide shirt sales will have a massive influence here. I remembered reading not long after his transfer that by Feb 2011, Torres was selling 40% more shirts as a blue than he ever did as a red...

So I did some digging (not very in depth admittedly but it is 8AM on the day after that calamitous load of bollocks against Swansea so forgive me).

First I found that the Daily Mail (forgive the source, let's just presume their info is correct on this!) did a survey in November [whereby they contacted Premier League clubs to ask for their top shirt sellers](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2229248/Premier-League-shirt-sales-Whos-wearing-who.html). Where most clubs gave a top 3, we were the only club to decline to comment... okay then...

This got me intrigued so I checked out some other stats and found that Torres is [No 3 in North America, behind Van Persie and Rooney as of December for the 2012/2013 season](http://www.talksport.co.uk/magazine/top-ten/121220/revealed-most-popular-premier-league-shirt-names-north-america-187757?p=7)

And then for global sales, [Torres is again 3rd.](http://dawn.com/2012/04/30/rooney-is-replica-shirt-top-seller-worldwide/) 


Overall, we are 4th in the global ranking for shirt sales, behind Utd, Real Madrid, and Barcelona so we are selling plenty of shirts. 

There will be a few that know the reality here, and that is that there is not a lot of profit in shirt sales...



...the real profit is made in selling the CFC brand worldwide and Torres is an intrinsic cog in the brand machine and until that changes, it will continue.


**EDIT: Disagree? Feel free to comment rather than just downvote.**

Extra thoughts/info: 

The average profit from a shirt sale is about £10 so there's a conservative estimate of about £9M annually for total sales of approximately 900,000 (not just Torres) but then you have to take into that the implications of our kit deal with Samsung, worth £18m per season and the deal with Adidas at £20m per season  (signed in 2010 for 8 seasons at a total of £160m). Both are massive global brands who will be delighted with the figures and will even, albeit indirectly, put pressure on our board to try and keep Torres playing in the hope that his performance will improve and shirt sales would even go up!",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,So... let's talk about Torres and his shirt sales...,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/16b13x/so_lets_talk_about_torres_and_his_shirt_sales/

So of late I am having terrible latency and packet loss problems with Virgin Media, it has been around a month now and I get these sort of results every night: http://www.thinkbroadband.com/ping/share/f43a9b4ce8265b5ab4307306ea5518eb.html After four phone calls and two technicians (one was a principal!) they still have not fixed the problem and now I am debating whether or not to switch to BT infinity. I have been snooping around and get a few mixed reviews but the majority seem to be good for BT infinity.

For my area I am estimated 59mb download and 20mb upload (amazing upload in comparison to Virgin.) The package I am looking at is up 75mbps download and evening/ weekend calls. With Virgin I currently pay £34 a month for unlimited calls, 30mb download and 1.9 mb upload. I will however be paying £41 pounds for the BT connection, so basically more internet but less phone time.

Can anyone tell me their experience with BT Infinity? Also what their latency and upload speed is like. I game a lot! So will need good latency and I also stream a bit but would like to stream better quality and more often.

BT HomeHub any good? (I suppose anything is good in comparison with the not so super superhub.

Second time I had a chest infection and got a substitute bint who failed me for being far too hesitant at roundabouts (was during rush hour) and for not getting up to full speed on a very turny, twisty country road.

My mirror work is great, I'm not worried about that.

I know how to identify crossroads and go down to first gear. If I can't see when coming out of my junction, 1st gear. Roundabouts, almost always 2nd gear, if big and open (like your maw) third gear is OK. If I'm taking the first exit, always second gear. All tight bends should be 2nd gear.

My instructor has taught me to do the manouvres by..:

Parallel parking: I do one full turn to the left after I'm at the half of the other car, until I see my point-of-reference (POR) which is the triangle in the left mirror, gone, then full-lock right and straighten the car.

Reverse into a junction: slowly back until I see my POR which is the left passenger seat window print in the corner of the pavement, 1/3 the wheel to the right, watch left mirror to fix myself up.

Turn in the road: Full-lock right down to the other side, stop, full-lock left in reverse, then get the fuck out of there.

And to always stop and do full observations at least three times. One for before I start the manouvre, another when my vehicle is swinging out/causing an obstruction, depending on how long I'm taking another in-between, then another before I continue the road

And if anything that MOVES come anywhere near me I must stop and wait

Fast forward to Wednesday morning at 1:30am and we were still drinking. I'd had no sleep and we'd kept going by ingesting vast quantities of cocaine (not mine, I never buy the stuff). We'd met a group of women who wanted to go to a jazz club so we went but after a while I was asked to leave because I was wearing jogging bottoms (I'd assumed it was only going to be a quick drink when I left the house) so I said I'd go home as I didn't want them to miss out. They didn't go for it and we moved on to another bar. At the door the bouncers said I couldn't come in because of the jogging bottoms, this time I started walking home despite the objections because I was knackered and the jogging bottoms were holding everyone back. I was around the corner from my street when a police van pulled up next to me but I ignored it and kept walking. I'd put a bit of distance between me and the van when I heard ""Oi, you! Come here!"" and two police officers were walking towards me. I shouted back ""Look guys, I'm hanging. I've done nothing wrong and I just want to get home, just leave me alone."" So I turned and carried on walking but then I was tackled from behind and wrestled to the ground. I started shouting words to the effect of ""get the fuck off me, what are you doing?"" Before I knew it I was bundled into the back of the van. I tried asking what I had done wrong but nobody even acknowledged me. After a few minutes I started bashing the divide to cause a ruckous and get some attention but yet they still ignored me. Fast forward to the morning and they let me go but on the arrest report it said they had seen me 'acting suspiciously' and fined me for a section 5 offence, being drunk and disorderly in public. Anyway ,I took the little slip and sent it off to request a court date because I feel hard done by and looking for a job is hard enough without having a criminal record as well. I would understand if I was being a dick but despite being asked to leave one place and refused entry to another I didn't have a go at anyone. I understood that I didn't conform to the dress code so the bouncers wouldn't have called the police to say there's a loony on the loose because I was cool with them. How can I make this go away because from where I'm stood I got royally shafted.

Please believe me when I say this is what happened. There's no detail I'm missing out to make myself seem more of a victim, this is the story. I've been arrested a few times and each time I deserved it but this time it's a joke and I don't feel it's right at all. Any advice? Also, I'll happy to answer any questions if anybody needs clarification.

Despite the 3-2 result to Manchester United (**Chicharito was completely offsides** - it happened right in front of me), this was without a doubt the greatest sports experience of my life.

If you have never had the opportunity to attend an English Premier League match (especially a match at The Bridge), please put it on your bucket list of things to do.  From the moment you walk into through the gates, the intensity is like nothing I have ever experienced.  From the supporters, to the players, to the ticket takers - the whole environment hinges on every play.  

For any Londoners who attended this match: Thank you for the kindness and hospitality that you showed a couple of Americans who love and were in town to watch your team.  Everyone we met had nothing but kind words and handshakes for us.  We will never forget it.

Let me know what you guys think and I'll give the /r/reddevils mods the go-ahead. They post about Liverpool so much on there that I doubt they'll even notice if Jamie Carragher is their banner image, but it could still be fun anyway.

When I was looking through the comments there, nearly every single one is a complaint about how poor their service is, how expensive it is and how some people are paying a fortune for monthly tickets and can't even get a seat most mornings... It just seems so unacceptable.

Some quick googling later and I learned that not only might we have the most expensive trains in Europe, they could be the most expensive trains in the world...

[Britain's railways named as Europe's most expensive](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/08/britain-railways-most-expensive-europe)

I've never really felt the need to speak out about something before, but I recently moved away from a lot of my family and friends and getting trains all over the country has just become impossible. If the majority of their customers feel this way surely something could be done about it.

I was hoping for maybe a suggestion of someone to write to, or maybe start a petition of some sort if there was enough interest, I'd really just like to see if something could be done to lower their prices because it's getting to the point where you can fly to various destinations all over Europe cheaper than I can travel across Scotland!",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Rail Fare In The UK,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/16bvtu/rail_fare_in_the_uk/

This is meant to serve as a wake up call of sorts.

I cannot tell you how embarrassed I am to call my self a Chelsea fan after what some of the fans did last night. First off, the 16th minute thing is pissing me off. Let it fucking go. He's gone, Roman doesn't seem to be the type of person to eat humble pie, Di Matteo WILL NEVER come back to this club under Abramovich, which is also why Mourinho will probably never come back and why Roman has allowed Torres to stay. Secondly, booing Rafa? Of course it's his fault that he puts out the best team and they fail to deliver. Shut up. It's not going to help anyone at the club and especially not the team. You don't like him? Go talk to Roman about it, make chants about how moronic Roman is for sacking so many managers. That's what I thought. Thirdly, booing Torres. I know he's not very good, I know he's missed countless chances, I know there are better options on the bench. It's clear he's not very confident in himself but BOOING him? Are you fucking kidding me? How does that help ANYONE apart from some idiot fans sense of entitlement.

Let me tell you something, we've had trophyless seasons before. Even under Roman. BOOING THE TEAM IS HARDLY GOING TO FUCKING HELP. It's no one's fault we're in this mess apart from Roman's. Stop pushing the blame onto managers/players and just remember that if we are in this position at the end of the season with no trophies won that would be an amazing achievement not 10 years ago. ~~Get off your fucking high horse~~.

I don't agree with every decision CFC, or RA if you will, has made over the past few years. I do believe however that he, whoever else makes decisions, are doing what is best for the club. 
With that said, I don't understand why the majority of the fans bash Rafa instead of support the players. It has been a frustrating year so far b/c of missing out on all the trophys, but even with the loss to QPR and Swansea the team is looking amazing. We are in a huge transition phase and I feel like the patience of the owner is rubbing off on the fans.
We have amazing players and may be signing even more talent this winter and next summer. I am excited where the club is headed and am ok if we have a few slip ups. I see chelsea fans whine way too much when we are so lucky to have a team that is fighting to be one of the best clubs in the world. We all know Torres is bad, but maybe there is something behind the scenes at work we dont know about. 
I would just like to see the fans stand behind the club, trust their decisions, and support the players rather than bash and boo them openly. Of cource I want us to win everything we can, but I would be ok if we didn't win a trophy this year. I am more devistated when the fans bash the players and coaches b/c we had a season of missed opportunities. I love chelsea and i love to watch them play more than anyone and no matter what I appreciate everything they do for us. Often i think this gets overlooked. Does anyone else feel the same way?

TL;DR - Are Chelsea fans too spoiled?

I love reading everyone theories on what this or that means. Doctor Who does this better than most shows, in terms of carry themes/ideas throughout a series. Some subtle, some overt, but always amazing. 

Had a thought the other day though. I had an opportunity when I was younger to hear Kurt Vonnegut speak (wish I had been older to appreciate it more), my class had been reading Slaughter House Five and throughout the book reads a line like ""somewhere in the distance a dog barked"". We racked our brains thinking surely this meant something, so given the opportunity we asked. He simply said ""I think its just something everyone knows, somehow there is always the memory of a dog barking in the distance"". 

At first I was disappointed, but then took it to mean that sometimes things are just in there to be there. Sort of freed up my mind to sometimes just enjoy what I'm reading/watching and not over think it, which brings me to my thought. In a DAE sort of way, who else sometimes shuts their brain down a bit and just sits back and enjoys an episode or two. To just take in the sheer enjoyment and entertainment that is Doctor Who. It is how I started watching, and sometimes its good to not over think it, and enjoy it for what it is, an amazing show that hits every emotion you could have in a show. Everything from ""don't blink"" to ""you're a potato"" to ""I don't want to go"". 

Sorry for the breadth of what seems to be a ramble, just felt like posting something to this end.

First I want to say this subreddit is really well run on a whole, I think, and I enjoy the discussions I have here. We don't have many of the issues that /r/soccer seems to run into (mainly regarding downvoting differing opinions). 

That being said, I've recently noticed us not necessarily applying the same standards to non-reds. Not that we have to like them or anything, but I feel we shouldn't be trying to downvote their posts. Two examples: the first is a recent post on here about an ad for the upcoming match against United (the one with the half Liverpool half United faces). In the comments, someone posted a link to the comment section of the same submission cross posted to /r/reddevils. The comments there had been agrresively getting downvoted, with only one or two at or above +2. I don't think the United users did that to their own comments, and our sub was linked to them. But I thought to myself, ok, that's a one off thing maybe.

Recently, however, the same thing has happened with the banner bet thread. In it, we had mods from /r/reddevils discussing the banner bet with us, and there were links to /r/reddevils. And something that United fans were mentioning is that for the second time in a recent period, things on their subreddit, namely their front page, were getting intensely downvoted. 

Now, I don't mean to make a big deal out of this stuff, I don't really think worrying about subreddit drama is worth it, especially over imaginary downvotes. Still, evidence suggests our supporters (or someone) has been downvoting a lot of stuff on /r/reddevils whenever they are linked here on /r/LiverpoolFC. We don't like United, but we shouldn't be invading their subreddit and messing with their content, even over something like upvotes or downvotes. 

I just hoped to bring this to people's attention so we could make sure something like this didn't happen again in the future. Also, I think a banner bet with them would be intruiging--as much as we may dislike them, I don't think they'll do anything TOO distasteful.

Then huh, episode after episode of the writing attempting to keep peoples attention by never really saying for sure who she likes. Followed immediately by their love being unbreakable and spanning the ages. Load of crap. And that's to say nothing of her ineptitude as a companion. Now here, I have to admit, the writers took worthless to a new level. In most of the history of the show the doctor found (and sometimes caused) a problem. He and his companion then would apply some form of critical thinking and solve it. Now they just seem to more or less run around letting the problems sort themselves out. Pond is just a poor character on a show who's writing has unfortunately declined. It has seen bad times before, I'm just hoping it goes back on an upswing. Combine all of this with the writers simply changing major attributes of some of the antagonists just to force a sub par plot line to work, and u get an all around useless companion.

If Huntelaar's release clause is really on 15mil euros (~12mil quid?) then I might be tempted. He is a good finisher and old enough so that he won't take Lukaku's starting spot when he is done with his loans. The main obstable, imo, would be wages. 

I'd also like to bring in Fellaini or, quite honestly, any proven midfielder. Fellaini is very strong and can surge through to attack as well as muscle others off the ball. He has enough to contribute to play to warrant his price, and he is still fairly young I believe.

I personally like the inclusion of multi-season plot lines (the ""question"" thing), I like his penchant for ensembles (the Pandorica episodes and the one where they [rescue Melody Pond](/spoiler), and I like how Moffat seeds things early-on, like the River arc and now with Oswin, [assuming we ultimately find out how she becomes a Dalek](/spoiler).

But like I said, go ahead and show me the counter-argument, perhaps I missed some very obvious decline in my haste to be current with the series.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,Why do some people contend that Moffat ruined Doctor Who?,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/16d832/why_do_some_people_contend_that_moffat_ruined/

&gt;First comeback - then loan to Serie A?
One can give the other for John Guidetti, 20, who with Manchester City Reserves play their first game in nine months.
- I'm ready, but we'll see what happens on Monday, he greets by dad Mike Guidetti.
FACTS
John Guidetti was recruited as a 15-year-old from Brommapojkarna of Manchester City in 2008 and then train duo Sven-Goran Eriksson and Hasse Backe.
Since then it has been a huge talent on loan from Manchester City on three occasions:
 
 Brommapojkarna
Allsvenskan, April 19, 2010
Guidetti was lent to 1.5 months and played seven Premier Division matches from the start and was into a. Conclusion: three goals.
 Burnley
Championship, November 25, 2010
The Swede was loaned in a month, played two matches from the start and was in three. Conclusion: a goal.
 Feyenoord
Eredivisie, The Netherlands, August 30, 2011
Loaned to the Rotterdam club throughout the season. The result was a huge success where the striker played 21 matches from the start and jumped into two. Conclusion: 20 goals.
275 days after his last match, the 3-0 victory against Excelsior to Feyenoord, John Guidetti could be back on the football field on Monday.
According Sportbladets sources with good insight into Manchester City's Swede included in the squad to face Reading on Monday afternoon in the Premier League's U21 series.
On New Year's Day was the Swede with the warming at a rapid pace with Manchester City's first team for the Premier League encounter with Stoke.
According to information provided to Sportbladet has since Guidetti both himself and the club doctor has given the green light to match play.
""He's ready""
When Sportbladet talking with John Guidettis dad Mike, he has just met his son in Manchester.
- John says he's ready to play, but we'll see what happens on Monday, said Mike Guidetti. John is so chastened now that he does not want to charge anything in advance.
Match play with the U21 team can become an important element in the continued resurgence of football at the highest level for John Guidetti.
20-year-old needs match play to bring up the pace and hardness in the body, but to break into the Man City team will be very tough - and clubs that want to borrow Swede wants to see that he is in the game first?
- Matches is a good news for John, but not a must for other clubs. Many of them know how John performs anyway, said Mike Guidetti.
In an extended interview with Sportbladet last fall said John Guidetti on his club future:
- In the January window, I think they (Manchester City) will find a great solution for me, and then, just honk and run. Then it's a matter of how I feel then. But this is certainly the plan.
- There will be interest, there is no problem, said the striker.
How do you see the situation now?
- Competition in the City is incredible, but it changes from day to day. It depends how it looks at the moment for Johns colleagues said Mike Guidetti.
City wants Jovetic
After the international transfer window closed last January remains basically just the ability to bi on loan to a Championship club in England for Guidetti jr.
But before that he would also be part of a deal. Man City are said to be very interested in Fiorentina striker Stevan Jovetic where Swede with Italian descent could go the other way, to Florence club.
- All that means that John is in a situation or club where he can play is attractive. But a lot could happen during this hectic period.
- When John was ready for Feyenoord took place during the transfer window deadline, said Mike Guidetti.",false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,null,null,self,"Guidetti looks to be set for a return to action this monday.

Fistly, apologies for the throwaway account - I'm quite active on a few sub-reddits and I don't like 'friends' knowing my personal life.

Secondly, I'm going to explain my current situation as it is, but will not explain how the situation came about.It would make for a very long tale full of, in hindsight, stupid decisions, love, trust and idiocy. Should you really want to know... if it will affect whether you can offer me some advice or not... please PM me and I'll explain all the gory details. I also know redditors are a canny lot and will probably piece a lot together yourselves.

On to the situation, and I'm really hoping someone can give me some advice. Just a little history to set the scene.

In August 2012, I moved into a small flat with my SO. I'm a full-time student, and receive grants / loans, and could afford the flat on my own if need be, so there did not appear to be much risk. My SO, on the other hand, was also a full-time student but received nothing in way of money... she was to get a part time job around her studies to pay half the costs. The furniture in the flat is all mine. My father acted as guarantor and completed all the security checks, etc. He also stumped up about £900 towards the £1650 the estate agents wanted for deposit / 1st month rent, with me paying the rest.

Now, here is where the really stupid part comes in... the 6 month lease was in my SO's name only. There were reasons, but... see above. As an aside, it was meant to be a 12 month lease, but... well... estate agents.

Just before xmas, she left. It was sudden and unforeseen and came as quite a surprise, particularly because she dragged it out all over xmas and NY. For most of that time I thought she was coming back. She isn't.

The estate agent knew I was here, but the landlord wanted single tenancy... but it was in our price bracket (it's a bedsit) so they kept it quiet, and would probably deny it vehemently.

So, my current situation: I'm living in a flat where I have no tenancy agreement. There is a month left on the lease (Feb 12th... it was meant to become a monthly rollover lease after this date).

I have explained the situation to the estate agent... they are happy for me to stay until the lease expires (last month rent due this weekend), but if I want to stay past this date, they say I have to go through the whole rigmarole again but in my name... and stump up a further £1650 for 'security checks' they have already done (my father would have to act as guarantor again... I'm a student!) and a deposit which they already have (the original of which will be paid back to my ex-SO, even though my father paid it).

And there is the crux of my problem. I like the flat. It's in a good location, I have made friends here (new town for me) and it's affordable. I have moved about a lot in the last 5 years and have finally found somewhere I consider 'home'. But I cannot afford another £1650 to stay, and the estate agent wants to keep the situation from the landlord, who would probably not be very happy with them.

As I live here, and can prove I have been paying the rent, do I have any legal recourse, even though my name is not on the TA? Have I got any leverage on the estate agent? Should I pay the last month rent if they can just evict me (on top of which it would stop the ex-SO getting so much back, and I could use the money for another deposit somewhere else)? Can they just evict me? Is it difficult to evict me if I just continue to pay the rent and do not leave when the tenancy runs out? Is there anything else I should be considering? Is the estate agent trying to rip me off?

I have a very important exam next week, this is stress I could do without, but it's my own fault. Please, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

So I’m doing my History Day project on how the comeback of the greatest show ever set a precedent for fandoms everywhere by having the loyalest and most devoted-to fanbase ever. I need 5 primary sources, and I’d like one of them to be an interview with someone who has been watching Doctor Who since it came out a second time, so I could compare it with someone who has been part of the fandom since the beginning, and someone who just started watching it, so I can put it on my website (my final project for history day).

It reminded me what exactly it is that we have in this country - a hardworking service that really does come through when needed.

So: I woke up Tuesday morning with chest pains and I was struggling to breathe properly, but being a typical Brit I thought ""ah its probably just a pulled muscle, I dont want to bother anyone, im sure itll get better"". 

Well, it didnt get much better, the pain diminished slightly but by Thursday I was really struggling to breathe. A quick call to NHS Direct led me to the point that, yeah, okay I really need to get down to A&amp;E. I got down there at 6.55pm and the A&amp;E process began.

Since I had chest pains I was seen by the triage nurse really quickly (within 10 mins) ahead of other people - first rule of triage: treat the most serious cases first -  I then had a quick ECG with a second nurse. By 8.45 pm I saw the doctor who had my ECG results, listened to my chest, and suspected a pneumothorax (or collapsed lung as we laymen call it).

This is where things got really impressive IMO. The Doctor himself wheeled me down to X-ray (yeah, i got my own wheelchair! :P ), I had a chest X-ray, and within 5 minutes they had the picture up on screen and yep - I had a collapsed lung! 70% of the left side of my chest cavity was full of air - bloody hell!! The same Doctor then wheeled me down to the Resuscitation ward, hooked me up to the monitors and everything and handed me over to the Resus Doctor. It cant have been much after 9.15pm at this stage.

I was hooked up to heart monitors, blood pressure monitors, oxygen supply, a line into my arm for meds, ECG wires the works! then I was informed of the treatment - a large needle through the chest to extract the air! Again within 5 minutes I had a Dr and a nurse with me, performing the procedure. I wont go into the details of what that felt like, but they pulled out 2 pints of air from my chest!

Another chest x-ray half an hour later to check that it had fixed the problem showed that it had infact worked and i was back to normal. Another half hour of monitoring without the oxygen and that was it - you can go home! It was about 11.30pm.

So in less than 5 hours I had been admitted, tested, diagnosed, treated, tested again, and released! Fantastic service!!

It also made me think of our American cousins - the same thing would have cost a US citizen many thousands of dollars. I had seen 4 nurses, 3 Doctors, an x-ray technician, had an oxygen mask, had my own bed, had two ECG's, 2 chest X-rays, blood pressure monitors, and an invasive procedure - all for free! ( okay not totally - see EDIT 2) Personally, I think we are quite lucky to have the NHS, even with its faults, when it comes down to it, they know what they are doing and can do it very well

**tl:dr** admitted to hospital with a collapsed lung, saw 4 nurses, 3 Doctors, had my own bed, two ECG's, 2 chest X-rays, an invasive procedure, and discharged all in 5 hours and it didnt cost me a penny on the day. The NHS may not be perfect, but it should be remembered just how good the system *can* be.

**EDIT**: thanks for the comments guys. It also seems like Ive started a bit of a debate about the efficiency of the NHS system. This story is just my personal experience that i felt needed to be shared because the media loves to concentrate on particular cases of poor performance. I am not claiming that the NHS is perfect. maybe i got lucky......who knows. Either way, im just glad to be cured and no longer in pain.

**EDIT 2**: okay okay guys i get it - the service isnt totally *free*, but it IS free at the point of service and I will never have a bill turn up at my door for the treatment i received, ever. I fully understand that the NHS is paid for with taxes (national insurance?), but i didnt feel compelled to delve into a discussion about the pro's and con's of tax-paid health care vs. other systems. Given the choice myself, id rather have the UK tax-based system over a private insurance based system.

During my stay here, I'll go to about £6500, not more. I'm not likely to return to Britain for work afterwards either.

It seems to me that the Doctor is kind of an arse to his companions. And not in a funny or endearing way like his predecessors might have been. He is constantly telling the girls to stay back, and while Liz is able to do her own thing in the lab, it seems like Jo doesn't really do much of anything. He and the Brigadier seem to respect each other but not really like working together. No one in any of the episodes I have seen seem to joke around, and I feel like if his Tardis were working he wouldn't choose any of them as companions. 

What I would like to know is whether he ever gets a companion that he does develop a friendly, respectful vibe with.

Well same as last episode, I loved it!

As a sci-fi show goes it had a great plot. The idea of the sun eventually expanding so that it destroys the earth is a very interesting plot. I found it great because we always think about how our future will change, our death yet we know the earth will always be there to welcome new inhabitants. But this has to come to an end. 

I really liked the assembly of various races. As a new first for the show each one looked incredibly convincing. It worked as a great culture shock for Rose, with each race having peculiar quirks and mannerisms, which in contrast to Rosé the doctor finds 'Fantastic'. Christopher eccleston comes across as a lot more alien in this episode than he did in the last, with his admiration for each culture on board. His doctor also exhibited the same mystery that was shown last week. Reflecting on it now with my current knowledge of the time war, the episode really works in showing that he is hiding something from Rose, and brilliantly unravelling his character as the episode progresses.  He's also hilarious and fun to watch, his bodily expression when replying to cassandras threat is great; 'what you gonna do, moisturise me?', classic. 

I thought the villains were also an interesting part of the plot. Firstly I like how the Adherents of the Repeated Meme were first suggested to be the masterminds behind the whole scheme. Upon first viewings this makes you unprepared for the revelation of the true villain. And now onto Cassandra. I enjoyed this villain, it was clever how at first she was presented as more comedic before being presented as more sinister and bitter in her ending. I find myself pleased with the doctors refusal to save her. I didn't believe it unjustified yet still cold, but I prefer darker doctor. 

Tl;dr

Interesting plot and villains, greater portrayal of doctor by Chris Eccleston and companion plays important role

We can configure this on a per-page basis... so if someone has a particular guide or other type of content that they would like to assume responsibility for maintaining, we can give access to that user or group of users to edit.

If you have ideas for content that should be present in the FAQ, throw them at us!  As noted above, if you want to write a guide of your own... please do!  There have been a number of ""Where do I start"" type guides in the past, but using the wiki we can make one that's official (and never disappears in the posting history).

You may have noticed that we've made updates to the sidebar and some small styling changes.  These are all somewhat related, all with the goal of making the subreddit more friendly and making the posting guidelines easier to find.

The sidebar had become so full that we were literally not able to add any more text to it.  By segmenting the data that was presented there into new wiki pages, we clear up space and make the sidebar more readable.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,[MOD] The FAQ has been updated to use the new reddit wiki system,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/16es1w/mod_the_faq_has_been_updated_to_use_the_new/

A content marketing/copywriting internship.

**About me**  
I am a 22 year old University graduate keen to work in a creative marketing based role. I recently completed a BA in Media at the University of New South Wales where I focussed on Marketing and Advertising. I also learnt how to make effective presentations in front of large audiences and refined my writing ability with the assistance of peer and teacher evaluations.

In my last year of studies, a few close friends and I formed the European Society of which I became Vice President. In this role, I managed the social media presence, wrote the copy for flyers, designed the logo, assisted in brainstorming and organising attention and fund raising events, and actively recruited members. Within two months, we were able to gain 120 loyal new members and were featured in the University magazine. At the time of my graduation, the society had over 400 loyal members. 

In addition, I supplemented my studies by attaining over four years of experience in sales, ranging from cold-calling to pitching and face-to-face interactions. This experience consistently helps me determine how to create and maintain attention and interest, and allows me to compose content that reflects this. 

Upon my relocation to London at the start of 2012, I worked for 10 months in an admin-based role in a small office environment. In this position, I wrote and sent out promotional material, developed and strengthened relationships with suppliers, successfully negotiated for lower prices and better service, effectively managed my diary and organised my time to ensure all deadlines were met. 

In looking for an internship, I am eager for an opportunity to utilise these skills and abilities to help write fantastic content for your business and approach any challenge and task you throw at me. I will also be happy to assist with administrative duties, and help your team with anything else you require. I am also fluent in Russian . 

**Goals**  
 My primary goals for this internship are to learn, network and grow my brand.

**Contact**  
Please PM me for more details and my portfolio. 

Thanks.

Welcome to another roundup of all that is juicy and ripe and ready for lying about, maybe we won't even mention [Frank Lampard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend) in this edition.

* First up, lying ITK spainish Journalist [Guillem Balague](http://theshedender.com/2013/01/tabloid-talk/atletico-chief-in-london-to-discuss-falcao-future) has said the Ateletico madrid Boss is in London this weekend to finalise Falcao's move this summer. watch this space...

* Here's the express expanding the [Guardiola](http://www.express.co.uk/football/view/370055) will be on £18mil a year story. Insane amounts of money being talked about there, especially for a coach who is unproven outside his club, let alone league.

* [Ashley](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2260524/Ashley-Coles-agent-flies-Spain-Real-Madrid-talks.html) is off to Real, or at least his agent has flown to Madrid, maybe. Mourinho to start buying/loaning all his past chelsea players into some kind of ageing Gallatico's? 

* Taison has gone to Shaktar leaving Willian to go elsewhere? [maybe chelsea](http://www.givemefootball.com/324393-chelsea-tottenham-on-alert-over-20m-brazilian-playmaker) but I honestly think it's going to be Spurs.

* [David Moyes](http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/article/168/8391235/moyes-planning-to-keep-fellaini) Has reiterated his stance that he is planning to hold on to all his players, despite Chelsea being linked with a move for Fellaini. If it's gonna happen it'll be fater the weekend I think.

* [Modric](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4739623/Luka-Modric-is-a-22million-target-for-Chelsea.html) again... There's actually nothing new to see here, they've just republished it with a line about Taison...

* [Benitez](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/9794593/Rafael-Benitez-expects-Real-Madrid-to-come-calling-if-Chelsea-give-him-the-boot-in-the-summer.html) to replace mourinho. Could we see staright manager swap in the summer? Mou for Rafa? Has this been Ambro's plan all along? I tell you one thing, craziers things have happened in football, much crazier indeed...

Note: I won't be able to provide my own commentary for the game, so I recommend checking out the [BBC's](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20919178) coverage of the game - which I will in all likelihood be using for posterity on this thread (though I might package in my own thoughts at half and full time).

**Kick-off**

(Due to the natural bias of this subreddit, Leeds's stats will be in **bold**, while Barnsley's won't.)

Defoe is a great finisher, but he's too god damn selfish and I really wonder what he's thinking when he's trying those out of the box low shots that end up rolling in goalkeepers gloves.

As with the Chelsea game, we played an extremely tight defence and midfield, pressuring the ball early and stopping the opponents before they could gain any momentum. Taarabt played up front on his own, holding the ball up and waiting to start a counter-attack.

A clean sheet is an achievement we shouldn't play down when we've only managed it three times so far (twice against Chelsea!). Neither is claiming a point vs. the league #3. César made some immense saves to help us get there, but the defence and midfield deserve recognition for their hard work. Derry was evidently the spiritual leader as others around him played a physical and pragmatic game. Nelsen and Hill have become a solid pair. Adebayor and Defoe are exactly the kind of players we've struggled to contain this season. That we kept them out is a positive sign for sure.

As far as the fullbacks go, I'm glad to see Onuoha given chances and making good; he seemed very out of favour only a few months ago. Fabio was one of our better players today. In the beginning of the season I was worried every time he went on one of his sallies forth into offensive positions (Norwich, anyone?), but today he looked in control, and very dangerous. Rafael seems to have cemented his place at United, so if we stay up we might get a chance to sign him. We should spring at the chance.

Unfortunately the other player we got from United was the exception today. Perhaps Park's age is catching up with him, but he seems reluctant to get stuck into challenges: whenever there's a 50/50 for the ball in midfield, it always seems to end up going the opposition's way.

Pleased as I am with the overall performance, I have to say that I still left Loftus Road frustrated. Unfortunately we're at that stage in our season where we need to be claiming points even from unlikely places;  draws are no good when we need to climb quickly. If Tottenham had come out and absolutely run us over, then fair enough -- they're a superb team when they get into their stride. But today, we shut them down, and we kept them out. And with the three golden chances that fell to SWP you'd have expected at least one of them to end up in the net. But none did, and it feels more like two points lost than one point gained.",false,superhoops,t5_2swvo,null,null,self,QPR v Tottenham post-match discussion thread,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/16fwau/qpr_v_tottenham_postmatch_discussion_thread/

Harry has proven he can assemble a gameplan to stifle an opponent when he puts his mind to it and QPR looked very much like we did against Swansea last season at WHL.

The overriding image I still have from that game was Benny absolutely hounding Wayne Routledge everywhere he went. We essentially man marked the shit out of their entire team on that day, and it frustrated them greatly. We allowed their central defenders possession but pressured them heavily once they got around the half way line.

This is what QPR did to us today. They were happy to let us pass around in our own half but they wouldn't let any of our players receive the ball comfortably in their half. It pains me to say this but Mbia made Mousa his bitch today, particularly early on where Dembele had probably his worst half for us. I've actually never really seen a midfielder handle him so well, so props to Mbia. 

This is unsettling to me because it's a formula other teams will employ. We don't have a passer capable of stretching the field, switching the play, or putting people through. The result is a staggering majority of our passes just being played into feet with backs to goal. 

We had the right movement at times but we lack the passing under pressure to take advantage of it. 

For example, whenever Lennon or Bale showed for the ball they were tightly man-marked by their fullback, even if they were dropping to our half way line to receive it. When that happens it invariably leaves space in that channel and in a 4-4-2 we should always have a striker exploiting it. On numerous occasions we did just that but none of our players ever even tried that pass because it isn't a particularly easy one. 

Benny could be a good cure for this issue IMO. A feature of our play last season was Bale dragging his fullback deep and playing it back to Benny, who could very consistently pick out Adebayor ""posting up"" in the channel and dragging a central defender with him. This obviously has a cascading effect that opens up space all over the field and gets impetus behind our attack.

This is just one example of our reluctance to play incisive passes. We can clearly see the runs being made but our players know they can't quite make the passes. IMO a passing midfielder is more important than a striker at this point, particularly if we're not going to play Gylfi or Dempsey who have both proven they can pick a pass better than most of our team. 

Not the end of the world but we do need to bring someone in IMO. ",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,Belated Post-Match Discussion,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/16g2ue/belated_postmatch_discussion/

People have already noted the connection between this season's Great Intelligence and the Second Doctor's Great Intelligence. However, there's another connection: The Daleks turning humans into Dalek puppets.

In the Evil of the Daleks, they attempt to turn humans into Dalek puppets, and for the most part, it works. However, it does not work on the Doctor. Interestingly, in the Asylum of the Daleks, they are turning humans into Dalek puppets, and while it works on most of the humans they run into, it doesn't work on Oswin.

The Second Doctor says the Dalek technology doesn't work because it's calibrated for humans. Is it possible the technology has been calibrated against humans and the failure to completely turn Oswin is a clue?

There's also something interesting about the timeline. Many people have proposed that the Evil of the Daleks is actually the end of the Daleks in their own storyline. This would make sense in the context of Oswin, whose ""human factor"" stopped her from turning to Dalek, so they needed to locate the Doctor and try to find the ""Dalek factor"" =.

I was referring to sky sports news that said that Sunderland are interested in signing Stewart Downing on loan, being on sky news tv I was thought the twitter/facebook/rumour mills to kick so I made the post about Downing expecting it to escalate.

The message I was trying to get across was **WAIT UNTIL THE MEDIA CONFIRM IT**, Downing on loan to sunderland. 

Instead most people read it as

^^wait ^^until ^^the ^^media ^^confirm ^^it, **DOWNING ON LOAN TO SUNDERLAND**

honestly sorry, made the post using my phone in the waiting room then been busy the whole day and thought by time i got home there would be a lot more information about it posted and people would have found and posted the information like we always do here...

except nothing else has been said, so instead of being able to come and clear things up with people I left people wondering what the fuck i was on about all day and really made myself look like a dick and a lot of people are now angry.

So my question is, do you think Clara remembers being Oswin? Does Oswin know/remember that she will be Clara? While they did say the same phrases (souffle girl, Run you clever boy and remember, etc), that could have come from being the same ""template"" rather than the same person. More like identical twins than reincarnations, if that makes sense. Any thoughts?

I joke because of Craig, because he's so awesome the show has become popular.
I forget for a second my friend has yet to watch doctor who, I am not supposed to reveal any spoilers to him because he is eventually gonna get around to watching it.... even though it's been around AGAIN for 8 years and i keep waiting for him to watch it... anyways back to the story.
He asks me WTF is a Craig...
all I said was craig first appeared in one of the doctors adventures in the lodger and he later came back at the end of the season.
I am being called out for spoilers. Please tell me how the EFF is this a spoiler, we argued and argued for a bit, I asked him to change the subject... he told me he would as long as I rephrased my ""It isnt a spoiler"" to... ""It isn't a spoiler to me""
how the eff is that a spoiler, people have come and gone from the show before, and I didnt reveal any heavy plot thickening crap.... makes me hot headed.
Wont rephrase because rephrasing means I was wrong and basically submits an apology when I didn't reveal anything :/

I'm sure they are tons of FIFA 13 players on this subreddit. I'm just wondering what your squad formations are when you play. 

I play in the standard 4-2-3-1:

-----------Reina------------

Johnson--Skrtel--Agger--Enrique

------Lucas-------Gerrard-----

Sterling-----Suarez-----Assaidi

-----------Sturridge----------

This formation has been awesome. lots of pace and trickery on the wings and Sturridge has been really clinical with the finishing. His touch fucking sucks though. many moments of frustration. Anyways thats it! Liverpool in 13 are way better/faster than the squad in 12 and now I can finally use them for every game i play.

At the end of Season 3, you never find out what happened to the Master's laser screwdriver. It could physically age the doctor but not make him regenerate. What if, somehow, the antagonist of the story got a hold of the laser screwdriver and used it on the older doctors? Given the amount of special effects used in a single episode alone, I doubt it would be too tasking to do. And there would be a canonical explanation of how the previous doctors have aged.

But it is completely backed up by the news. I'll tell it how I heard it anyway...

So the job was in a call centre, pretty boring job, my job was resetting passwords for MSN, which involved literally hitting copy and paste for 8 hours a day. They gave you these inductions which last about a week, where you sit around all day.

There's a lot of free time so people are talking away etc, when one guy, Stephen, notices another guy, Lewis, staring at him from across the room. Most people when caught staring at someone, intentionally or not, snap out of it, but Lewis doesn't. He just keeps staring at Stephen.

This happens a couple more times. Pretty much everyone agrees Lewis is strange, so Stephen doesn't think about it too much.

One day, everyone's going home and Stephen gets into the lift, with Lewis coming along. The doors close then Lewis pulls a knife and stabs Stephen twice in the neck. Stephen tries to fight him off, until the doors opened and some people restrain Lewis.

He gets arrested and questioned and it turns out that Lewis is a paranoid schizophrenic. The doctor's records say that he thought the TV would talk to him and that the radio was 'replicating everything he was saying on the phone.'

He also thought he worked for MI5 (read he thought he was James Bond) and that his workmate Stephen was his target.

As if it's not bad enough that it didn't get picked up before that happened, he left (some articles say escaped) from the mental institution he was put into, moved to France and became a teacher!

They only found him out because he told staff he was a Scotland Yard Detective.

I used to take those lifts in work before I knew the story was true and it was a bit weird thinking about it.

Their comedy seems to have gone from Father Ted, Green Wing, Spaced, The Daily Show, Black Books, The Inbetweeners, Brass Eye &amp; Fone Jacker to The Big Bang Theory, The Inbetweeners USA, Rude Tube &amp; Two Broke Girls. It's high volume american imports. Those were the only comedy shows I could find on this week on 4od. 

Their documentaries have fallen even further. We used to have 9/11: The Falling Man, Time Team, Extreme A&amp;E, China: Triumph and Turmoil, Drugs Live: The Ecstasy Trail, Philosophy: A Guide to Happiness. This week we had One Born Every Minute, a repeat of The Sinking of the Concordia, First Time Farmers, Dispatchers: The Secrets of your Car Insurance (*thrilling*) and Undercover Lover (*as bad as it sounds*). 

We also have Made in Chelsea and The Only Way is Essex to factor in, and the apparent death of Peep Show. 

My question is does anyone know if there's a reason for this fall from quality, to the lowest common denominator, and a rush towards reality tv. Is it the fallout from a post Big Brother Channel Four or is it a consequence of a more competitive advertising market? Or lots of things? Or someone in the company?

**TL:DR Do you think the quality of the new programs on channel four has get worse, and do you have any insight as to why that might be?**

Oh, and one more thing, this is going to suck considering the fact that the last creative thing I wrote before this was a story for /r/nosleep, and before that something for an english class three years ago. *ahem* let's begin. Oh and very very slight spoilers if you haven't gotten past series three. But only near the end.
So, the doctor is tramping around in the time vortex all lonely and sad, while he tries to decide on a destination. Suddenly, there's a knock on the door! He questions this while he gathers his wits and opens the door. Outside stands a young male about the age of 19. He enters and the doctor asks him how he can do that. He ignores this and asks the doctor, ""why have you got her trapped? Don't be mean."" The doctor looks around obviously confused and is about to question the boy, but he's disappeared into thin air. Obviously curious as to how this happened, he tries to track him by using the TARDIS. Something backfires and sparks fly, while the doctor wonders who he is and how this is happening. yada yada, several episodes pass, each with the boy making a cameo being chased by another man who looks out of place. The doctor continues trying to catch the boy, but is always a second too late. Doctor meets the man chasing after the boy, and asks him why he's chasing him and who he is. The man introduces himself as (insert name)(we'll go with Bernard) and says the boy has something that he wants. The boy's name is Aldric, and he's ""stolen"" a series of coordinates from Bernard. Bernard realizes the doctor has a TARDIS, and asks to see it. Once inside, he discreetly places a small box on the console. After a minute or two of walking around inside, he picks it up, and places it in his pocket. The moment he steps over the threshold, the TARDIS powers down. The doctor realizes that Bernard has somehow stolen the TARDIS matrix. Bernard says that with this he can travel to a place called the Isle of the Gods. He somehow manages to dematerialize himself using the TARDIS matrix without a proper shell. Aldric suddenly appears telling the doctor that it's time he found out the truth. The doctor requires his help to save his own TARDIS.  Aldric grabs the doctor's hand and surprisingly dematerializes and appears on a desolate  planet filled with ruins. The doctor asks him where they are. Aldric explains that this is The Isle of the Gods, the home world of the TARDIS people. The doctor, obviously confused about the whole ordeal, questions the existence of a TARDIS home world considering the fact that TARDISES are Gallifreyan technology and were grown in a lab. Aldric explains that they are in a space beyond time. He also explains that the TARDIS people were a great civilization that once was the most beautiful in all of time and space. The TARDIS elders dictated that a member of their race must be given to the Gallifreyans in order to defend the universe from the Daleks. A young man was chosen for this. He complied and gave himself to the Gallifreyans so that they might use his power to travel through time and space for good. However, what they did not count on was that the Gallifreyans decided to mount an expedition to the Isle of the Gods. Once there, they found some way to destroy all of the males in the society leaving only the women and children. They enslaved the rest, harvesting their matrices, their essence, for use in TARDIS production. The first TARDIS taken was horrified by this and fought against the Gallifreyans. However, not being in a completely physical form, he was not able to do any damage. He was given the ""honour"" of becoming the first and only organic TARDIS. Once in a physical form, he took the opportunity to fight against the Gallifreyans, and escaped Gallifrey. To avoid an issue of ethics, the Gallifreyan elders concluded it be best to tell the general populace that the TARDISes were simply inventions. The doctor, obviously confused, hurt, and angry begins to lash out. The doctor then calls into question how Aldric knows this. The doctor realizes that Aldric is the first TARDIS. The doctor begins to apologize, but is cut off short by Aldric stating that they must protect the matrix pit. Once a TARDIS dies, their matrix is led to a large pit in the center of the Isle, swirling and swirling around causing the Isle to maintain its existence beyond time. Bernard wanted a TARDIS to tap into the pit and use the matrices to create an army of TARDIS half breeds that would help him take over the universe. The doctor and Aldric begin to walk towards The Pit, and when they finally reach it, discover that Bernard is already there. Bernard tosses the box containing the Doctor's TARDIS' matrix stating that he no longer needs it. Bernard, attempts to shoot the doctor so that he could not foil his plan. Aldric jumps in front of the doctor, taking the bullet. The doctor rushes to Aldric's side and begins to weep. Bernard, in an action that he hadn't thought through very well, reaches into the pit with his bare hands, and begins to glow. He is filled with the knowledge of a TARDIS, causing his brain to overload with information as Rose almost did at the end of Series 1. The doctor, weeping, asks Aldric why he took the shot. He says, ""It's kind of sad, being a lonely god."" The doctor, wondering what he means, asks him. Aldric explains that because they existed throughout all of time and space, their images were often picked up by lifeforms, and interpreted as gods, thus starting religion. He says, with a smile on his face, ""I can finally be with my people again."" and dies in the doctor's arms. The doctor, crushed at the loss of something so precious, lies there, broken. After a while, he gets up, and reinserts the TARDIS matrix into it's place. He strokes the console stating that he's sorry, and that he wished he could have stopped it. ""but then, we wouldn't have had any adventures, eh, old girl?"" He returns to present day London and the scene fades out. It returns to the Isle of the gods, and shows Aldric lying there. His soul begins to leave his body and go towards the pit, but it stops short, and returns to Aldric. He revives with a start, and simply says that he cant go, because it's not yet his time. He dematerializes and appears in the passenger side of a small space ship. He looks over, delighted, and says, ""Oh, its you! You wouldn't believe who I just met!"" the screen shifts to the right revealing an obviously confused Jenny. He says ""this mode of transportation isn't to efficient... How about you and I go together?"" He winks and says, ""Next stop, everywhere"" blah blah credits.

I know that. But what is currently annoying me is the cult like fame he has around here, no matter what it's about. 

For a prime example, i don't like him when he talks about transfers - he's posted several cryptic messages about Walcott, Huntelaar and Downing sounding like he personally knows what's happening in them (each time proved wrong). it irks me. yesterday i posted in his downing thread, and was probably a bit too brash - but my point was valid. When i looked yesterday it seemed like people agreed. But now the downvote brigade has come in (what happened to reddiquite and not downvoting people's opions) and my two posts are know in negative karma(?). It's not the magical points that annoy me, it's the fact that my valid point is being destroyed all because ElevenReds is a cult figure round here.

This is a one time use account but I feel like I owe a lot of you an explanation, then I will answer any questions I can, as best as I can. 

Im truly shocked and humbled by your response, kind words and thoughts.

I've said it many times before, I don't and have NEVER created posts or commented for my own benefit
but i do so because I love interacting with you and this community. You are all such a positive, 
interesting and good looking people that I actually enjoy being part of it and I have never found a community
anywhere else that comes close to you. 

(*soppy and emotional*, but true)

---------------------------

* **The Downing Situation:**

You all know about the Downing post by now, I made the post after seeing a report on Sky Sports News
TV that Sunderland were interested on taking Downing out on Loan. SD being a hot topic I made the post
with the expectation that things were going to escalate and more information would come out during the day,
but it didn't. 

The rumor (like so many others during EVERY TW) turned out to be false and people were left with a post 
from me that they couldn't quite understand.

The Title 'Wait for the media to confirm it, Downing on Loan to Sunderland' was interpreted in two ways.

*How I intended it to read;*

'**wait for the media to confirm it**, Downing on loan to Sunderland' 

this group knew I was posting a Transfer
Rumor and that despite the hype (I was expecting to escalate) we should wait until it is confirmed.

*How a lot of members read it;*

' ^^wait ^^for ^^the ^^media ^^to ^^confirm ^^it, **Downing on loan to Sunderland**' 

this group assumed I had
made some kind of ITK official statement, but that was not the case and as many times as I tell people, some
people still wont get it in their heads that I am NOT an ITK.

I had no access to the internet or TV all day so by time I got home and went to check up on things, I was
shocked to see no new news on the rumor/transfer on Downing. Having spent a long time on this sub, I was hoping
and assumed that somebody would have found a few website links or reports that gave more information on the rumor
(like what happens in most rumor posts here) and posted them in the comments. 

Nope. 

There was almost nothing on the story and it looked like I pulled the rumor from thin air and thankfully
and a long time after I made the post somebody found a [twitter link from a journalist that backed that there WAS
a Downing to Sunderland on loan rumor](https://twitter.com/JNorthcroft/status/290181961480286208) even if it was
false.

By then It didn't matter. Of course there were some justifiably angry people and I don't blame them for being upset,
I apologized for the cryptic message and for leaving everybody confused and then explained myself. 
But their were some who just used it as fuel to the fire for their already well established personal hatred of me.

* **The PM situation:**

I've said in the past and to the people that PM me to talk, that from time to time ill get the odd angry PM and although at first
they bothered me, I eventually got used to them and either ignored them or set the record straight calmly. 

Yesterday seemed to be the tipping point for a lot of the guys that didn't like me, I received maybe 30+ PM's, some simply asking me to provide links, evidence, further information all standard reasonable PM's.

The rest however ranged from bitter to just pure cuntish, varying from how I've ruined this sub by posting shit about players I don't like and I hide behind my name to enforce my own views on people and how I make out like Im an ITK  and Im a cunt and you said Walcott and Huntelaar were 100% guaranteed buys and they didn't come, your a lier and everyone sucks your dick, your lying about your grandparents dying and illness to get attention blah blah blah..

That of course was a quick summary of the topics they covered and it may not sound devastating when listed like that but there were one or two PM's that got really, REALLY personal, threatening to tell people who I was, where I lived, family info.. all this because they just didn't like me and my post, I was seriously shocked and with how things at home had been going I found it all a bit too much and decided I had enough.

* **Deleting ElevenReds and the response:**

I deleted the account early in the morning and no more than 20 minutes later somebody had noticed and reported it to everybody else (SwingYaGucciRag, thank you for your support from day one brother!) Most people figured out pretty quickly that the PM's may have been the cause although nobody knew what was said. 

I got in touch with the Mods who were brilliant and have been brilliant since I first signed up as ElevenReds, they have been fully supportive and really patient and they fully understood my situation. 

I wasn't going to get in direct contact with you guys for a few months while things settled down but after coming by  to see whats going on during LFC vs UNITED day I was shocked, humbled and surprised to find a petition for ME to come back had been made! not only that but an incredible amount of you upvoted it and showed your support and shared your kind words. 

I read through every bodies comments, concerns, questions and complaints to try and get an idea of how I should handle the situation.

* **The Good, The Bad and The Ugly...**

**The Good**

A lot of the comments were great to hear, I really liked hearing that you guys like having me around and enjoy my posts, comments and talking to me! That said I think a lot of you give me *waaay* too much credit, I merely create the posts **YOU** guys and girls of the community make them work and worthwhile and when I comment I just try to speak honestly but respectfully as to why I think what I think. There are also a lot of contributors, posters and commenters that contribute as much and a lot more than I do and I think its very unfair people single me out and not them.

Some people seem to think I think Im never wrong or I only get upvoted based on my name but the truth is I get put in my place and corrected all the time, but, when Im wrong I listen and learn. I still make mistakes or say unpopular things all the time but not as frequently because I've learned from the other members in this community. As for Upvoted just for being ElevenReds, people since the first YNWSA have downvoted me regardless of what I post or say just because Im ElevenReds, regardless people who do like me love to challenge what I think and say not out of spite but to improve everyone's understanding on the point im trying to make and to help me improve it. 

**The Bad:**

The infamous Walcott and Huntelaar posts... the same thing that gets brought up whenever a transfer post and my name gets brought up and yet most people completely misunderstood the posts and the point I was getting at..

Yes, I did tell you information that I should NOT have told you regardless if it was getting reported and I promised id never publicly reveal information like that. BUT, a lot of you misunderstood the difference between me saying 'yes were interested in signing him and talking with his agent' and 'were going to sign him'. I told people we had contacted both their agents and their was interest, I then said **in my own opinion based on the information at the time** that I believed we'd sign one of them if not both of them, that was my personal belief. I also mentioned that for any deal both sides have to agree and that situations and circumstances change but people forget to mention me saying that, regardless Huntelaar changed his mind yet Walcott is still in question but it looks like he's getting ready to settle at Arsenal. Yet some people refuse to let this go and bring up old comments from months ago, like I tell them I had to base my opinions on the info available at the time but I apologize for getting peoples hopes up.

**The Ugly:** 

Im not an ITK... of any kind, I've said this SO MANY times now its embarrassing when people tell people I think I am or I 'claim' to be..never happened.

Using my past and current employment situation as leverage in discussion or for intimidating people against disagreeing with me: I will NEVER EVER do that ever on anyone, everybody is welcome to say anything to me, I love discussing or debating different Ideas so to hear people say they wont say anything to me because of fear of downvotes from others is ridiculous. I will also NEVER post anything publicly that can get me or anyone else in trouble 

some people are getting angry at how people have reacted to me deleting my account, like i and others have said there are a lot more brilliant contributors on this sub that dont get nearly as much credit as they deserve, but please understand i got on well with a lot of people and understand their frustration that I decided to go because of a few members.

Fellaini does so much for the team and is an incredible and intimidating presence on the pitch but his 22 million pound buy out clause could do a lot for Everton.  When Jack Rodwell was sold for 12 million Moyes was able to make a good turn around and bring in some valuable additions to the squad.  I can't be the only one who realizes how thin the squad is and how much the lack of depth hurts Everton.  Mirallas, Gibson, and Hibbert are all out at the moment and yesterday's match vs. Swansea proved that we don't have too many valuable subs to bring on.  I'm tired of seeing Naismith come on the field and not do anything.  With the amount of money that Moyes would get from Fellaini's buyout he could work wonders.  He already does so much with so little but with his astute financial prowess and that much money coming into the club he could make some stellar signings.  Signings that could provide more options at striker, Jelavic isn't the same as last season so far, and at midfield where Everton are weak at times.  I'm not saying that the club wouldn't hurt from Fellaini leaving, it would be quite a blow, but I feel like Moyes might be able to make a good number of  signings that could bolster the squad and pave the way to the Champions League.

Anyway, aside for the usual ""That's why your going down"" chant (we get that every game, by the way), we shared a good bit of banter with your fans. I particularly enjoyed us arguing about who hates Chelsea the most - Just so you know, it's us.

Since returning to the PL Chelsea have used their web site and match programs to belittle us, which is why it's always nice to beat them. During games at the Bridge their half-time announcer is unprofessional and cracks jokes about our club and how small-time they feel we are. So it was great to read [a classy article on your club website](http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/spurs/News/i-thought-it-was-in-jd-13012013.page?).

I always knew that town centres are a bit rowdy on a Fri/Sat but holy shit these stats are crazy:

**HEALTH**

1/8 ""bed days"" in the NHS are used for an alcohol-related illness

1,168,000 patients admitted to hospital for alcohol excess in 2010. That's 25% of all hospital admissions!

2m people drink more than 2x the recommended weekly limit. 1.4m drink more than the weekly limit in one session.

65% of suicide attempts are when the person is drunk

**CRIME**

900,000 alcohol related crimes in 2011

50% of deaths in the UK involve alcohol (drunk driving, murders, suicides)

70% of rapes in the UK involve alcohol (either the victim or the attacker)

30% of arrests in the UK are alcohol related

73% of domestic violence cases involved the attacker being drunk

50% of street crime (i.e. muggings, assaults) involve drunk people

34% of prisoners in the UK are dependent on alcohol

**COSTS**

Estimated cost to NHS = £3bn/yr

Estimated cost to criminal justice system = £10bn/yr

Estimated cost to industry = £7bn/yr (missed days of work mostly)

That's £20bn total

On the flip side, the government ""makes"" roughly £7.5bn/yr from alcohol duty, £7.5bn from VAT and £5bn from the employment of the alcohol-related industry. That totals up to £20bn - roughly the same as the financial costs.

However, there are intangible ""costs"" like the public fearing for their own safety, people being hurt in those aassults and fights, making the local area look worse etc. And hidden costs like lowering the value of houses around trouble spots or certain areas descending into shitholes, insurance premium increases for victims, cost to councils to clean up etc.

To me, the UK seems to have a huge problem. We've seen policies around stricter sales to under 18s, the whole ""alcohol unit"" idea, ending promotion deals on alcohol, and even the discussion of minimum pricing rules. Does anybody have any good suggestions? Also, I know that many /r/uk'ers are keen on the idea of drug legalisations. I would also like to see that happen, but in the case of alcohol, the UK population are shown to be highly irresponsible. To me, that is a huge reason why the government won't legalise more drugs.

So I've been following this season quite closely and I believe our team is too small and/or predictable at times. I think in theory the trio of Hazard, Oscar, and Mata are excellent individually but I don't believe it can work together. For one, they are all too small and too similar (correct me if I'm wrong). They can move quick, possess creativity, but they are far too similar. For instance, when we are struggling in one game, it seems like we need a Hulk type player who can bulldoze into the opposition and strike a shot from afar. Our trio can't do this. I feel like Chelsea is catering to a Barcelona-style attack with small players that want to touch pass all the time and make the killer ball. But I just don't think its working for us. Maybe we are holding out for Pep to come coach us? I just think we aren't playing the usual brash, in your face type of football like the past.

At the very end when River ""breaks time"" they are all transported to a new world where more craziness ensues. 

At the end when Amy is having a glass of wine and River shows up. They discuss where they are in their respective timelines and Amy says she just watched the Doctor die. Not only that but she remembers killing Madame Kovarian. So here's my question: At what time are we seeing this Amy?

If she just saw the Doctor die then she has a full season ahead of her travelling with the 900+year old Doctor, but she would also retain the memories from the alternate world. If this is the Amy that the Doctor leaves behind, is she drinking because it is the one year anniversary of the Doctor's death? Unless the Doctor dropped her off the same time former Amy is in America.

So I'm going to leave it up to you to answer. And provide a thought out reason why (i.e. no ""cause Star Trek is better""). So here it goes: The Sontarans (Doctor Who) vs. The Jem'Hadar (DS9).

Objectively speaking, it's clear that the Jem'Hadar were at least partially inspired by the Sontarans. Both races were genetically engineered for the sole purpose of combat, and both races were provided with a flaw in their genetic makeup (the back of the Sontarans' heads providing a weakness for the enemy; the Jem'Hadar addiction to ketracil white). 

I think the Jem'Hadar would win the space battles easily (we never really get a look at Sontaran space battles, but considering how easily the Jem'Hadar destroy galaxy class Federation starships, I think we know who's the juggernaut here). Ground battles would be a lot closer,  however, I think the Jem'Hadar would probably eke out the victory initally. However, in a full scale war, the Sontarans need either to destroy a ketracil white factory or destory several of the Founders to secure themselves a victory in the full scheme of things.

Number 1 in possession ( no surprise really )

Number 3 in Aerial Duels

Number 1 in shots per match ( Suarez takes about 1/3rd of them )

Number 4 in Passing accuracy ( no surprise again )

We are nowhere in team ratings. This is probably beacause we dont have a squad depth and the transition period in understanding the rodgers system.

Well, the 2005 revived series to be exact.

I just moved back to my home city and one of the first things I did with my two best friends from high school when I got back was suggest a Doctor Who marathon. I gave them a couple of options on what to view first, where to start, and stuff like that. But we quickly decided on the biggest marathon option. We're going to be viewing *every* episode beginning with S1E1 ""Rose"", plus all the spin offs in chronological order.

We were three episodes into Series 1 at my friend's house and they were both absolutely hooked. We click ""Play all"" on the DVD and sat in total silence for the whole 2 hours while we watched, until we needed to change discs. We got 6 episodes in and both are eager to continue and want to know what ""Bad Wolf"" actually means. (When they asked, I replied ""Spoilers."" ;-) ) I highly recommend getting friends who have never watched the show before to join you on a marathon. It's so fun watching them get steadily addicted.

It's honestly one of the best and most fun things for a Whovian to see absolutely everything from the beginning. Seeing every story arc play out is very entertaining, and I highly recommend doing it with friends who have not seen the show before, seeing them become totally obsessed within 3 episodes.

It's also kind of heartbreaking because I know much feels will be had at the end of Series 2, and we'll all be holding back many manly tears.

Getting to watch ""The Stolen Earth"" / ""Journey's End"" with people who are seeing it for the first time *and* will be following both spinoffs is the thing I'm looking forward to the most!

Our original stance was to allow everything and let the community moderate itself. This has broken down in a few instances and I've personally received a fair amount of requests to act upon this. Based on the discussion results, there's enough support of memes to allow them to persist, but there's enough opposition to it at this point for us to change how we deal with them.

I'm proposing that we only allow memes to be submitted through a self-post. Any direct image links will be removed. I want to see if it'll reduce their impact to the front-page and allow posts with more content to easily rise above them.

I'm 27. I graduated from University in July with a degree in History, which I want to pursue a research route in the long term but I can't afford to, as I feel research is probably my forte and something I think I would enjoy building towards.

I'm getting really fed up though of the current jobs market and myself. I have absolutely no idea what career suits my skills and attitudes, everywhere I turn there's next to no advice. I've been applying for admin positions but I don't think admin suits me, there's just not enough responsibility for my own work. I worked briefly in a retail environment and I can guarantee that sales roles do not suit me at all and it is exceptionally clear in any interview I do not have the charisma for front-line sales, so I'm really looking at office-based roles. Generally I feel I am suited to roles that support or help people, so I've kind of slid into admin roles that involve supporting operations, although I've kinda wondered if perhaps HR may be more my thing. I don't know.

To make it worse, the jobcentre is demanding I apply for 14 relevant positions a fortnight, so far I've found 2. Everything seems to be an apprenticeship these last few weeks, or they want someone with specific experience in the role. I've got two years of admin experience, which really does not help my application process.

Basically, I've had a couple of interviews and they've all said I'm more or less overqualified for positions despite lacking the specific experience. The higher positions still want the experience. I'm basically trapped in an experience limbo and it's driving me crazy. I don't think I could afford to volunteer because bus fares and money spent on food would be difficult to manage and as far as I know there's no help on that front, but I'm starting to feel that might really be the only way I'm going to get anywhere. I've used Indeed, the jobcentre's new system, jobsite.co.uk... I've browsed individual businesses sites, looked at various things, been to recruitment fairs... it's just all not panning out.

I want to work, I want to get my life sorted out because frankly, I am sick of being on JSA and the hole my CV is getting from this is eating away at me. I'm already spending time trying to teach myself skills, but there's a serious issue in that I need to be spending time finding a job. Does anyone have any advice or anything they could suggest I could try?

It's all legit, I get taxed (overtaxed as I am on the wrong tax code) for my wages and have been working here since the end of April last year. Since then, the entire staff roster has changed, we've had a new manager and now I've been here the longest, and I've not even worked here a year!

Up until last week, there were 9 of us on the usual rota, meaning there was plenty of cover for all shifts. However, due to hours 'needing to be cut', two members of staff have been taken off the rota. I've asked about this a couple of times, to which her response has been ""it's none of your concern"". This now means there are only seven of us to cover all shifts throughout the week, which I personally feel isn't enough. 

My next six months has been planned out as such:
In work 8 days
Off work 4 days
In work 7 days
Off work 2 days
In work 8 days
Off work 4 days
In work 7 days
Off work 2 days etc. etc.

I never agreed to work long weeks every week for a sustained period of time. I told my manager this, who told me the rota shall not be changed, and if I'm not happy with it then I can leave. Is there some legal requirement somewhere that says an employee can only work so many days between days off? Or that an employee can only work a certain number of days in a row per calender month or something?

I also have a large amount of Holiday Days left, but with the rota being completed for the next six months I'm not sure if I'm even able to take them.

I asked my manager for contact information for somebody in HR to file a grievance complaint, but she told me it wouldn't get me anywhere and that the rota is not a grievance as it's ""only a rota"" and that I was ""lucky to have a job"". Is this true? Is it even worth me sending off some sort of a grievance complaint?

This is the straw on the camels back now, as throughout the past six months the company's standards have declined dramatically. I have a list of issues I've been wanting to bring up for a while, but have felt that if I voiced these opinions then I would be dismissed, as I'm not on a contract and therefore am not legally held to work here. 

So if any of you guys could give me a bit of information on the best ways to file my grievance, and whether or not I do have a leg to stand on in this, it would be highly appreciated!

I follow the Norwegian league kind of close, and he's definately one of the most promising Norwegian prospects. Whether he's good enough for the Premier League, that's a different case. He has won the Norwegian league with Molde FK two years in a row, and has been impressive for the Norwegian national team.

[Here's a Wiki page on him](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegard_Forren).

***
Shifted to the Saturday due to my work commitments and training clashes. Also moved it to 8pm because I finish work at 6pm and even then I still might be late. Please feel free to start the party without me and I will turn up fashionably late. I'm hoping we'll have the Jolly Roger flag to assist new people to ID us (that reminds me, we really need a good photo of the flag so people know what to look out for). /u/Flamekebab is in possession of said flag so hopefully he'll bring it along. Also feel free to PM to exchange numbers or whatever. I'll have my phone on the night anyway and will be updating the thread.

All the people that said they will be attending in the previous thread I'm hoping you'll still be able to attend this one, but if not, there will be more meetups in the future! 


The other exciting announcement!

I will be participating in my very first Muay Thai [fight](http://imgur.com/DMJIE) on the 24th of February in [Greenock](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=kickback+gym+greenock&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;gbv=2&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl), Glasgow! Its all very exciting and nerve-wracking and I'm extending the invitation to attend this glorious event to the good folk here (because I need people rooting for me!). Also its an excuse for a reddit day out and a piss-up. No matter the outcome of my fight, I'm getting drunk (licensed bar at the club!). If there's a better excuse for necking a pint, I've not yet come across it!

Unfortunately it is a ticketed event and I've only got 9 left so friends will be prioritised (you know who you are, you sexy bitches) but please let me know if you wanna come along as there might be spares and I'll have the tickets with me on Saturday.

* First up [Falcao](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4742082/Falcaos-French-fancy.html) would rather go to Paris, France than London, England. What a prick. I don't think I'd want him now even if this report turned out to be unfounded rubbish... 

* [Lukaku](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2261823/Romelu-Lukaku-wants-stay-West-Brom.html) is having so much fun at WBA he would like to stay another year, he's only 19 you know. Must love a Balti.

* The daily Star have us all but signed [Iago Aspas](http://www.dailystar.co.uk/football/view/292887/Spanish-goal-ace-Iago-Aspas-heading-to-Chelsea/) the celta Vigo striker I mentioned last week. £8.5m for Michu 2.0 (I hope).

* This one is in French but basically it states that we will bid for [Mbia](http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Mbia-vers-chelsea/342183#xtor=RSS-1) if QPR get M'Villa. not sure about this one though...

* [Kalou](http://www.dailystar.co.uk/football/view/292929/QPR-boss-Harry-Redknapp-eyes-ex-Chelsea-star-Salomon-Kalou-and-Swansea-s-Danny-Graham/) maybe going back to West london to play for... QPR. I thought he left on rather good terms as well.

* [Guardiola](http://www.givemefootball.com/324638-german-giants-beat-chelsea-manchester-united-to-first-guardiola-move) news just in, the German Giants Bayern Munich have apparently made the first move in trying to tie down Guardiola, they may not have the financial might of Chelsea or City, but could the footballing aesthetic and club set-up be more appealing to the in demand Spainard?

* [Willian](http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-and-spurs-target-willian-runs-into-trouble-at-shakhtar-8450921.html) who some papers are still claiming is a target for Chelsea, just because our name sells more papers than Spuds, has not returned to training, because he's a big sulky, unprofessional baby. Should fit in well in North London then.

* and finally a Geordie car washer (or something) is pissed off because [Demba Ba](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/newcastle-car-cleaner-fuming-after-1534131) still owes him £40 or something. Do one son, he's dawn sath naw.

First stop is the Lake District. The trouble is, I'm finding it hard to locate accommodation. I want somewhere self-catering, but I'm not aware of a decent site where I can search for them, aside from flipkey. Does anyone have any advice in this regard? There's probably going to be quite a few couples, maybe 5 couples in total. Any suggestions?

I'm thinking of staying near Ambleside. Or possibly Keswick, but Keswick seems to have even less accommodation. 

Also, while we're at it, what are good things to do? So far I've got my eye on;

* Gorge Scrambling
* Swimming
* Nature Walks
* Fishing
* Kayaking
* Climbing
* Caving/Potholing

Am I missing out on anything good? Are all of these activities within easy reach of either Ambleside/Keswick? Which town would you recommend? We could do with a bit of night life. Not a lot, just a couple of reasonable pubs.

Travel wise, is it easy to get to these activities via public transport or is a car strongly recommended? If so, any ideas where we can get one at reasonable cost.

Also, I like to cook when I'm on holiday and sample the local produce. Are there any good markets/shops/butchers etc in these areas where I can get some banging local ingredients?

The exam limits are usually quite tight, I've got friends who have resat exams (mainly essay based ones - such as politics) 2 or 3 times because there wasn't enough time to complete it in the first place.

My personal belief of what exams are is for them to test your knowledge, understanding and recollection of your chosen subject. I don't see why there should be time limits at all. Currently it feels like you're being put under more pressure to formulate your ideas within a specific time period, which for a great deal of people, isn't beneficial nor a true reflection of what they can achieve.

I got an e-mail from UCAS last friday saying my application had been updated and I found I had been unsuccessful. The decision letter from the university was really vague and confusing as to the reason I had been turned down so I got brave and called them. I got through to a lady who said that I hadn't got on to the BA but I had definitely got an offer for the HND subject to me finishing my current OU course. She said that if I hadn't had a decision letter by today to e-mail her and she would make sure it goes through. I hadn't had anything this morning so I e-mailed her.

Earlier this afternoon I get a phone call from a different woman saying that I have to attend an interview. I was confused about why I would need to attend an interview if I'd already been accepted onto the course, but the person I spoke to was very vague about it and just said I had to. Later in an e-mail I confirmed that my acceptance was ""subject to the outcome of the interview"".

I am quite upset at how things have turned out and I'm not sure what to do. Part of me thinks that I should call the original woman I spoke to and ask her what is going on, but since they're in the same department I don't want to jeopardise my chances in interview. It just doesn't seem fair to make and offer an then take it away.

Pardon my being vague about the subject/university but I don't want to risk them seeing this and it going against me.

Any advice would be appreciated!

I know this is going to get a lot of hate from you people, because I'm posting in a UK subreddit. But I'm having some what of an identity crisis.

Anyway, here is my quick backstory. I'm from Liverpool, and after a short duration of my life (I'm 17 years old now), I moved to just between the border of England and Wales near Deeside/Flintshire/Connah's Quay in the early years of my life.

Anyway, I'm doing language exchange on a frequent basis, however, it hits me like a ton of bricks when people are asking me about my country. 

To cut to the point. I hate it here and I constantly dream about moving away. The people are rude, the girls are ugly on the inside and usually the outside because they plaster themselves with make up topped with a very vile attitude. 

I have been to many places around the world but almost none in the UK apart from this run down area where people constantly remininsce about how good it was in the 80's and 90's (Bob Marley played here), smoke weed, and do drugs.

My living conditions aren't bad, I'm just extremely bored and unhappy of what I'm seeing on a day-to-day basis.

Yes, many famous musicians came from the UK and scientists. But in the end, I feel like I'm living in what the UK really is, however, I want to be proven wrong...

I want to be proud of my country. But the problem is, I don't know how when I'm surrounded by these people. So, I'm hoping reddit can somehow help me with this problem.

Don't wear flat shoes, especially things like skate shoes, they get really slippery.

Don't dump hot/boiling water on your car to defrost it, it could damage the paint and crack the glass. Use room temperature water and a ice scraper.

Don't drive as fast and be much more generous with your braking distance.

Bikes make good transport through slush, the tyres just cut through. Not a good idea to go very fast though. Dry the bike off properly to avoid damage if you do take it out.

Scarves and hats might look silly but just wear them. Don't want to catch something nasty, do you?

Stock up on a few extra day's worth of dry food that you would eat anyway, just in case.

Tea is good.

**^^This ^^YNWSA ^^post ^^is ^^dedicated ^^to ^^the ^^ElevenReds ^^Cult ^^and ^^the ^^mods**

**THIS PAGE IS: on stand by more to come later!!** (This is how im going to indicate things are being updated..) 

----------------------

*This just in...*

* **[What was I Sahin?](http://i.imgur.com/mlD26.jpg)**

Sadly after months of failing to break into the first team Nuri Sahin, arguably one of the best specialist midfielders in the world 
[has left Liverpool for a return to Dortmund](http://i.imgur.com/Jwm2y.gif)

After battling Arsenal for his signature and only playing a handful of games many fans were left wondering why we bothered to take him loan him in the first place

* **Forren on the verge of sig..No? who?..Southampton!? seriously, who writes this thing..**

With a name straight out of Lord of the Rings and a hair cut to match, a lot of excitement was generated when reports revealed that the [up and coming Norwegian footballer was to have a trial at LFC.](http://i.imgur.com/4paoa.gif)

Reports have come out since then that suggest he has canceled the trial and has signed for Southampton.. [but we aint mad, right?](http://i.imgur.com/0gONc.gif)

* **[Sneijder shows Dutch Courage](http://i.imgur.com/w5Usw.jpg)**

This weeks wild card is world class midfielder Sneijder.. ^^not ^^like ^^we ^^already ^^had ^^a ^^much ^^cheaper, ^^younger ^^one ^^in ^^Sahin ^^but ^^not ^^petty 
^^even ^^though ^^its ^^a ^^fucking ^^joke.. the dutch maestro has publicly said he wants out of Inter and he's available for only 9m! 

*'9m for a world class player!? are you sure ElevenReds?'* Yes, I'm sure bitch!

but he comes with a catch.. [a MASSIVE £200,000 a week in wages](http://i.imgur.com/cFUQU.gif)

With Allen and Jonjo failing to find form and Suso too young to be counted on [we may have no choice but to pay up..](http://i.imgur.com/zKBKH.gif)

BR has admitted that Liverpool's spending policy in recent years when its come to wages ['could have been better handled'](http://i.imgur.com/7uaxn.gif)

* **[Cole does best and heads West](http://i.imgur.com/6Gi2O.jpg)**

After months of protesting in the middle east, the bankruptcy of Greece and the declining Ozone layer Joe Cole finally took responsibility for his actions and [left LFC
once and for all!](http://i.imgur.com/qkfZa.gif)

However, in the midst of celebrations it was revealed that Liverpool couldn't negotiate their way out of paying all of his ridiculous wages and [Joe Coles Agent was less than enthusiastic about lowering his clients wages](http://i.imgur.com/KmSKh.gif)

* **Time To Try, Tom**

2 weeks in and we're still after a player that many considered to be a done deal..at first what seemed to be a decided 4m deal has risen to to a reported 6m, whats worse is that is expected to rise if Liverpool cant manage to snap him up in this window.

Fans are divided, at 4m and his current ability he could go on to become a good player or we could wait and watch him end up else where [but a choice needs to be made soon.](http://i.imgur.com/U2v0g.gif)

* **..and he lived happily ever Afra**

Newcastle's Ben Afra has been linked with Liverpool after publicly saying he wishes to leave. After an outstanding season last year Newcastle have failed to regain their incredible form and the sale of their key players have seen them fall down to a place [that only the Hubble telescope can see them](http://i.imgur.com/Mb0O4.gif). 

* **[Move your Assaidi](http://i.imgur.com/hQZbR.jpg)**

A lot of talk has emerged of Liverpool's mysterious player Known as Assaidi heading on loan to Ajax or Galatasaray. The player who has had very limited playing time in his 6 months here, but he has largely impressed and [some fans cant work out why BR is reluctant to play him..](http://i.imgur.com/SEpCU.gif)

As of right now Assaidi is at the ACoN with Morocco 


--------------------------

*In Other News..*

-------------------------


* **[Gerrard is not down with the kids](http://i.imgur.com/Mqbm9.jpg)**

There was wide debate that Gerrards performance in recent years has been declining with age, despite his lack of goals this season which we've relied on in other years 
he's been storming the [assist table with 8 placing him top](http://i.imgur.com/wqrmq.gif).

In an Interview Gerrard was asked how he felt about playing in such a young squad to which he responded
that he didn't think playing a young squad would get results. 

* **Sturridge 2 for 2 on debuts**

Well, fuck me.. [He did it!](http://i.imgur.com/1RPcr.gif)

The first time since Suarez has a player we've bought has lived up to early to the hype and in some spectacular fashion! 2 goals in 2 first appearances from Sturridge
has fans foaming at the mouth over his potential. Still early days but thanks to [Chelsea's tight spending policy](http://i.imgur.com/bo8D1.gif) LFC were able
to bring in this highly rated undervalued striker in for just 12m!

* **[Suarez Hands us a win](http://i.imgur.com/BZ382.jpg)**

Suarez was again making headlines but for all the wrong reasons after he was seen handling the ball before he scored against Mansfield [sending us through to the next
round despite angry calls for a replay](http://i.imgur.com/DAdu2.gif).

While rival fans maintain the argument their teams consist of saints that would have admitted to the offence, a number of high profile players have come out
to defend Suarez. [Nobody could argue with his explanation of the situation..](http://i.imgur.com/ah0qW.gif) 

* **Sing your Carrolls, you need a miracle**

Andy Carroll when asked what team he'll be playing for next summer replied 'Liverpool'...[yep](http://i.imgur.com/pKnRM.gif)

* **Grab Your Coat Suso, You've Pulled..** 

In the last week 3 LFC players have threatend to deactivate their twitter accounts (Enrique, Jonjo and Suso) with 2 (Jonjo and Suso) actually going through with it due 
to harassment online.

Some have said they are just overreacting and should ignore them, however I personally think they should have looked to me as an Example of 
[how to handle situations like these](http://i.imgur.com/SDbIY.gif)

Not sure if anyone posted anything like this before, but has anyone else noticed a lot of parallels between Doctor Who's Amy Pond and Torchwood's Gwen Cooper?  Here is some of what I mean:

* Their lives are interrupted by a strange, alien occurence 

* Which is explained by a strange, attractive, and very mysterious unnamed man who fights/interacts with aliens and invites them to do so with him

* Romantic tension arises between them and the mysterious man despite them having a boyfriend/fiance

* Which leads to said fiance not liking the man very much

* Despite this, they decide to marry their fiance, but not before a strange alien occurrence happens right before their wedding

* Which goes on as normal, but is interrupted by the mysterious man (and no one but the protagonists remember the whole fiasco afterwards)

* Eventually the alien side of their life begins to be almost too much and they feel like they have to 'choose' between it and real life

I'll be at WHL on sunday for the first time of my life.
Basically, i have a choice of two tickets: 
- Upper south (park lane) in section 44: 125 pound
- East upper section H: 160 pound

I know nothing compares to the atmosphere at park lane, but ive been told east is not that bad. But im concerned with visibility.
Can anyone help me make a choice?
Also if any of you is going to the game i would love to meet up and grab a beer or 12 before the game

It's a design company initially selling originally designed t-shirts to help give me a small bit of finance whilst I attempt to garnish myself some clients for illustrated design work. I didn't want to spam the /r with my site which I'm selling the shirts on; but if you are interested I can add the link.

I'm pretty nervous about becoming self employed but I'm also more motivated and confident in my venture than I have been when approaching some job applications.

Basically I'm looking for any advice you folks have on being self-employed or good places to frequent to promote my work/ services or just to network ( or any good subreddits haha) , I've gotten a fairly OK start but I want to throw myself into it and I think one of the best ways to learn is to take advice from those who may have been through it.

So let me know what you think, please.

**edit**
 
So a couple of you have asked about the site which is **opticapparel.bigcartel.com**
Just a simple big cartel site to give and easy store front.
I also have a twitter,facebook and tumblr for the brand where I post extras and competition updates ( something I did today infact!) 
twitter.com/opticapparel
facebook.com/opticapparel
opticapparel.tumblr.com

And I have also been asked about funding!

I have received two areas of support in setting up the business really.

1. Because I was a jobseeker for so long; after six months your eligible to apply for what they call the NEA allowance which basically means you get referred by your advisor ( if you request it, I had to as my advisor neglected to mention it was available to me i found it through my own research ) to speak with a mentor about setting up your business and they help ascertain whether its a viable idea and help you write a business plan which has to be approved by said mentor ( about a 8 week process in all) if your approved your eligible for the NEA allowance which means you sign of jobseekers but for the first 6 month or so of your new self employment you still receive some funding from the DWP  £65 a week for the first three months and £33 for the last three. ( you can also get a loan of up to £3-5000 as well, I didn't opt in for that )

2.Now the princes trust was another line which I explored through my own research, having gone to their site you can apply there for your initial application for help with funding and advice, ( But the rule is it has to be for a new business not an existing one, so if your doing it along side NEA you need to time it so you complete your princess trust process before starting your NEA and signing of.) Either way I applied to them and you get invited to their offices to discuss your idea, they are used to dealing with all levels of initial idea whether it be your have a faint idea or like me where I had basically finished my business plan. After the initial talk they explain what they can offer and how the process works which is.
You must attend a 4 day workshop on setting up and running your business,
Complete a business plan with them and
Take that plan to panel where it will be discussed and they will decide whether your eligible for funds.
If successful in order to receive agreed funds you must have weekly/monthly meetings with a business mentor who will advise you with any problems your having /make sure your not running your business into the ground ( my meeting haven't started yet and prob wont for a month ).

The princes trust funds come in two forms,
A grant of up to £1500, but there are only certain things you can spend this on, for instance you cannot buy stock with it, or vehicles. And it works in a drawn out process of you find the item your business needs and they fund the finance for that item, in other words they don't just give you the money to spend for your business.

Or a loan which again I think went up to £5000 maybe more if I remember I got a small loan for initial stock ( You can buy stock with the loan as that is just money to spend as you want because its you know... a loan.) but to get the loan you do  need to go through credit checks and all the usual legal.

With both of these funding options you do have to justify why you need the money in your business plan but they mentor you when writing the plan and you can keep going back for advise so its never really a concern, they basically don't want you to fail straight of so do everything they can to avoid it!

I am not sure if the princess trust deal is different region to region, I know the job-seekers isn't that's a standard throughout the UK I'm Lincolnshire based and I know in the surrounding regions there was funding available but with some age restrictions. I hope this can help you guys and maybe give you a nice overview of some of the funding available and if you have any-more questions just ask in the comments or PM me!

I don't know anything about how insurance works here, so any advice is welcome. Here are a few questions that first popped into my head:

1) I have rented a room in a house where the owner also lives atm. Do I need a separate insurance for my room? Will I need an insurance that covers the possible damage I do to the house (i.e. leaving the gas on, forgetting to turn off the tap in the tub)? Or just one that covers my possessions in case of accident/theft?

2) Would a home insurance cover my bike?

3) Should I get a separate insurance to cover my bike and me for any damage we do to each other or others?

All good links on insurance matters are also appreciated. Thank you wise women and men of the internet!

The unquiet dead. The ninth doctors unofficial christmas special. While I found this episode to be less engaging than the previous two I still found it had many positive elements that make it a joy to watch.

 Firstly there's rose.watching it again I found that her character progresses greatly early through this early series. I like the way Mark Gatiss uses her to explore the doctor as she talks about days dead and the life that he leads. There is also a strengthening of her bond with the doctor, you now feel as though they are now friends rather than strangers. 

Christopher Eccleston's doctor was once again on top form. What I like about eccleston is his aggressive nature. He doesn't listen to roses beliefs in this episode. He's more cultured with a greater understanding of right and wrong, not taking any other opinion into account. It's a weakness in many not to value the opinion of others but for the doctor we don't see it as that as he is the doctor, of course he's right. We don't even stop to question his logic. 

A piece of dialogue that I found engaging was the idea that time if constantly in flux and always changing. Now I'll be honest I didn't find the story that interesting. But the idea that time is always shifting adds more drama to the story as we are able to see this threat as also being a threat to ourselves in a modern context. I may be going off on a tangent here but that does beg the question, if the human race could have been destroyed in 1869 then why are events such as the death of Adelaide brook a fixed point? Surely that makes the survival of the human race a fixed event. It's simply the complexity of the show and means our understanding is not complete which is actually a good thing as it means future writers can explore this aspect for years to come. 

The supporting characters were well acted. I found Charles dickens to be well portrayed and liked his character journey he went to as more heroic and open minded. The show should be credited in that the doctor can affect the lives of people in small ways, simply by engaging them more in the world. The scene with rosé and Gwyneth  was incredibly well written, I found myself understanding her feelings and shock at the future world. 

Tl;dr

Not as interesting as the last two but some great aspects to enjoy. The show is slowly unravelling the doctor to the audience and is doing a fine job of doing so.

There was no toilet on the train, and I thought I could make it to my stop if I paced up and down the carriage. I was the only one in the carriage so I was doing my little poo-poo dance, but as I approached the penultimate stop before mine, my stomach/bowels decided that they could no longer hold in the torrent of shit/ diarrhoea inside me. In shear panic and horror I grabbed a newspaper and shat on it, but loads spilt on to the seat.  I grabbed another newspaper and tried to clean up the seat but I left a horrible stench and mess. I don't know what else I could have done. When I got to my stop I took all the newspaper in a carrier bag and waddled home, dumping the bag in a bin. Through some miracle noone saw any of this, and I was able to shower and sleep and forget about it. But ever since I have been overwhelmed with embarrasment and fear of being ""caught"". 

TL, DR: Felt ill on a train, couldn't make it home and shat on the seat. Terrible mess was made.

1. Cool people to hang out with - most of my friends are also living overseas or have at least moved out of this city.

There have also been similar post's regarding aggressively integrating our youth to fill the half-voids we have in our team. We are all also left hanging regarding the stadium, though we can take the recent opening of our new training facility as a positive sign.

I would like everyone to sum up, it makes sense for people to want certain players if they would perform other aspects of the management differently. 

Personally, I don't any big signing's are a necessity. I would like to buy a striker, but if we simply cannot afford a player like Damaio then I trust Levy's judgement and back him in his decision.

I definitely want to see an out and out striker on the bench, even if that means Coulibaly. I do not want to see an attacking bench where Dempsey is counted as our striker, I don't think he offers enough in the form a striker for our team, formation or style, though I do rate him.

Nothing else major for me, I genuinely don't know if I'd feel any different had we not agreed a brilliant deal for Holtby, but we have.

McCormack also scored which is great as it's his first for a while.

What if MPs were elected by random lottery, and not a popular vote? 

Similar to jury service, names would be selected at random off the electoral role and the 'lucky' 600 or so would be invited to stand as MPs. Because of the large commitment, it probably shouldn't be compulsory, but the incentives are there to encourage most people. Should you choose to accept your seat, you would be committed to attending, it's not like you could accept the salary and expenses and not turn up half the time like certain current MPs.

If this system is considered fair enough to base trials on, surely it's fair enough for the legislature? And with a considerably larger sample size, you'd have much less chance of an unintentional bias emerging. 

Once ""elected"", your name would be removed from the list so nobody could do more than one term. Combined with the unpredictability, this would eliminate career politicians and reduce populist policies. Should anything go wrong with a candidate, randomly selecting another would be quick and cheaper than with by-elections.

Perhaps the PM should be directly elected to ensure that the person with the ultimate responsibility is capable of handling it. Those who seek power are frequently those least suitable to wield it, but unfortunately I think this would be more successful than thrusting the keys to No. 10 on some randomer and hoping for the best.

The PM should still be allowed to pick their own cabinet too, between the Commons and the Lords they should be able to cobble together a semi-capable bunch.

I have just recently watched the entirety of the 2005 series and as an aspiring Game Designer (currently in my last semester of a Game Development university education) I was inspired to make a game loosely based on Doctor Who and more specific the episode ""Blink"", you know because of copyright and stuff.

Anyway the game would be a survival horror game where the player has to survive the Weeping Angels assault while trying to get out of a creepy house with poor electricity. To help the player would have a flashlight with limited battery to keep the angels in sight while trying to get out of the maze-like levels. The player would not only be faced with the puzzle to escape the angels but also solve different puzzles of the different levels (example: turn the electricity back on so you can get through a unlit area) I am still debating whether or not to make the player be in possession of a Sonic(What do you think? To obvious reference?).

My question to you lot is of course if you know if any similar projects have been made or are in the making and if it would be something the Whovian community would be interested in. My initial plan is to make a playtesting prototype which would feature one level and really poor graphics which I would make available to the public and especially this subreddit. Then if interest is high enough I would try to get donations via kickstarter or any other means to try and produce a commercial product to distribute via Steams ""Greenlight"".

Please note that although I enjoy Moffat's episodes, *I do not believe one writer is better than the other.* I enjoy *both* for different reasons, just as I believe *both* have shortcomings for different reasons. 

**TL;DR for this thread: Out of personal curiosity and because this is a ""discussion"" thread, I would like to see people expand on their opinions. I'm frequently left wondering why it is that people think something or why they hold a certain opinion. I *personally* favor posts and comments that do more than drop a one line opinion, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.** 

EDIT: I apologize if I have come off as not wanting others to voice their opinions. I greatly enjoy reading through well reasoned, meaningful discussion- *and this is precisely what I want to encourage.* I don't need to agree with others to recognize and even appreciate their well-reasoned arguments. I wish that I saw as much quality discussion as others seem to, and I certainly intend to keep a sharper eye out for it in the future. Again, thanks for reading!

In light of all the Moffat/Smith hate circulating in this sub, I'd like to point out how most of it seems to stem from the simple fact that they aren't RTD and Tennant. 

~~Get over it.~~ 

This is a constantly evolving, changing show and it always has been. People need to accept that and *MOVE ON.* This is not to say you aren't completely entitled to having a favorite Doctor or a favorite companion or even a favorite writer. However, the show *has* changed- along with the Doctor, companion, and writer/producer. 

~~*This being the case, lets discuss the* present *content.*~~ 

I'm sure I'm not the only one who is getting tired of seeing this subreddit devolve from meaningful conversation into a never ending stream of posts and comments about how it ""used to be better,"" ""Moffat is ruining this show,"" and ""eleven needs to regenerate already.""

So please, *PLEASE* focus on meaningful and constructive discussion. This *is* a discussion thread, not a rant/complaint thread. 

Thank you for your time and consideration my fellow Whovians.

The thought of Luis wearing a fucking City or Chelsea shirt chills me down to my very soul. 

I'd like to believe the new improved contract he signed a few months back was an indication of his committed to ""the cause,"" but it's more likely it was done to secure his services past January, and ensure when it does come to selling him that we'll get the highest price possible.

If he goes in the summer I'll be slightly resentful. I think after all the support the club has given him he owes us at least another season. If by the end of the 13/14 season, when he'll be 27, there's still no sniff of Champions League football and he decides to leave, I don't think there can be many complaints.

Personally, I was very disappointed. The main take-away points for me were:

1. It was without any of the sharpness which so marked the original series.

2. The jokes were naff and markedly dumbed-down. It was an ITV version of 'The Thick of It'.

3. It was a showcase of abysmal acting, with very poor delivery for the most part.

4. What were they thinking with Bernard?! He reminds me of the dimwit in Extra's mock-sitcom 'When the Whistle Blows'.

Overall, I'm reminded of another example of TV plundering its past for ratings -- specifically, the Cracker 9/11 episode.

Being an avid car enthusiast myself, I thought I would remedy the lack of UK-focussed car subreddits that exist.  I know things are a lot different in the UK, in terms of the new and second hand markets, rules of the road, and what cars are good and what cars aren't.   I dare say this place will be self-moderating to some extent, but here are a few ideas of what sort of threads are acceptable:


* Showing off your car - Pictures, videos, descriptions.
* A project you may be working on
* Advice on what car to buy
* Advice on a fault your car has
* UK or EU-related automotive industry news
* General driving discussion

----
**Please do NOT post anything that would possibly incriminate yourself or other road users. This includes YouTube videos clearly showing you doing a 0-100mph sprint on a public road.** 

----


Lastly, this is the first subreddit I've created or moderated so I am gladly accepting help with both moderation and initial customisation - If you want to design a logo, feel free!  Also if someone knows how I can enable flair so that we can use it to display what car we own..?!

On /r/soccer there is a Manchester United fan who offers to meet people and buy them a drink, and that seems to go down pretty well.

* [here's](http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2892/transfer-zone/2013/01/16/3676180/-) a video from goal.com in which some soppy bloke says some things in a annoying way, one of which is Frank is going to LA, which I would certainly  be happier with than Man Ure.

* Sports witness, amongst others have been badly translating Spanish broadsheets  to come up with the news that the Piazon to Malaga loan deal is all part of a first dibs on a [Isco](http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/topics/spanish-broadsheet-say-chelsea-got-isco-first-option-as-part-of-p) deal. Who everyone knows is fucking awesome in FM2013.

* hold on a minute [Iago Aspas](http://www.givemefootball.com/324877-reading-make-first-move-for-10m-chelsea-target) isn't going to Valencia, he's going to Reading, poor chap.

* [Jone Okore](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4746139/Jores-Okore-will-cost-Chelsea-4million-say-Nordsjaelland.html) from Nordsjaelland will cost us or Fulham £4mil if we wanted to buy him, which we don't.

* [Willian](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/shakhtar-donetsk-prepared-to-sell-willian-to-chelsea-or-tottenham-for-20m-8452590.html) who we don't need any more but they keep linking us to him because we sell more papers than Spuds, will be available for £20mil.

* [Guardiola](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21038983) said some nice things about English football, whilst speaking at an FA event, therefore he really, really, really wants to manage in England.

I think it's safe to say none of us actually want to know as losing that sense of mystery would suck, I think it could be done fairly simply without us actually knowing the final answer. 

My thoughts are along the lines of whatever is going to go down at Trenzalore is in progress, people fighting lots of tension I'd assume The Silence is there. So The Doctor get's cornered or things come to a head and the question gets asked. Dramatic pause then enter River.

""Hello Sweetie, am I late?"" (Or some such typical River-ism) The Doctor grins, runs over to her whilst saying something witty and whispers the answer in her ear. 

Just because the question must be answered doesn't actually state to whom. This would explain how River knew his name in the Library episode. Towards the end we see a emotional last date between the two and he givers her the future sonic.

-ramble- It involved the Doctor and these people in space suits and they were dead, but they had been taken over by the spirits of trees or something. And this one woman was speaking with death and death was telling her that all the children in the world were the exact same. 
It is positively thrilling. This feeling of beginning a brand new adventure. Knowing nothing about this entire world and the promises it holds for me. The excitement, the heartache, and the journey that I will share with these characters. Does anyone else know that feeling where there’s an exact moment in an episode of a television program you’ve never watched and you know you’re hooked?

And one day, I’ll be watching the episode that got me hooked and I’ll be able to give a proper synopsis of it, like anyone who has been watching a series for quite some time. Truthfully though, sometimes it’s exciting to stand in front of that proverbial doorway and not know what you’re speaking of, but you know you’re filled with the thrill of finding out and beginning your journey.

SOUTHAMPTON: Boruc, Clyne, Yoshida, Hooiveld, Shaw, S Davis, Schneiderlin, Cork, Puncheon, Guly, Rodriguez – Subs – K Davis, Lambert, Ramirez, Fox, Ward-Prowse, Seaborne, Chaplow

10mins gone: Chelsea are in control

15mins: Punch heads over

23mins: It's a slow game. Saints look rather blunt in attack with Rodriguez casting a lonely shadow up front.

24mins: Terrible defending but a great goal from Demba Ba. Bugger. 1-0 Chelsea.

30mins: Saints seeing more of the ball, trying to get back into the game. Not many options attack wise and the ball often going back to Boruc. The team are missing Lambert's presence.

34mins: Apparently Forren is watching the game and had his medical today looks like he will be signing for Saints

36mins: Steven Davis misses a decent chance inside the penalty area, poor attempt. I'm still trying to figure out what he does.

40mins: It has been all Southampton since they went a goal down. Some nice moves and possesion but nothing clear-cut other than Davis' chance.

42mins: Lampard shoots wide, nice Chelsea move.

43mins: Saints are under fire, great save by Boruc stops a Hazard shot making it 2-0.

44mins: 2-0 Chelsea. After a scramble, Chelsea hit the post, the ball comes out to Hazard who gets his goal.

45mins: Half-time - I don't see how Saints are going to get back into this game. I will only update on the scoreline in the second half as the gf is home.

45mins: 2nd Half underway, brace yourselves.

57mins: Lambert is on the pitch, header, GOOOOAL! 2-1!

75mins: Punch scores a beautiful half volley after great work from Shaw! 2-2 Maybe Adkins is a tactical matermind afterall!

I said the guy who follows up Fergie had a tough job with the shadow of the man who went before him being so large, and that United could potentially find themselves having a very tough period of time like ourselves. Apparently this caused outrage and it was inconceivable that United could ever be outside the top 4. United will ""always be in at least the top 3, just off the title"" blah blah blah.


I was astounded by the absolute 100% confidence that United (or anyone) would **always** be the dominant team.


And it got me thinking, I was born just after the period were Liverpool were the dominant force in English &amp; European football.

**So, how inconceivable was it to those who were around at the time that we would be 20+ years without a title/being the dominant force?**

Manchester United simply don't slip up in this scenario. They just don't, and we won't have a 100% run for the next 13 odd weeks. If we keep reasonably good form and hold on to third, maybe an optimistic 2nd then I'll be pleased. We didn't deserve to beat  Stoke the way we did, it flattered us and actually put pressure on the team to perform and, well, they flopped.
Looking specifically at tonight; basically a full team, didn't provide the goods. I honestly believe the missing part of the puzzle these last few games was Victor Moses. He is a beast, gets the ball and holds it up as well as anyone I've seen, takes zero guff from defenders and has a great touch and finesse behind the chunk of an exterior. If he gets back, starts linking with number 29, we'll be in business.
I'm not going to hassle Mr. T, because he doesn't need it, we know how we feel and opinions differ.
I do believe we will end up winning the Capitol One cup though, I just have a good feeling, and I expect us to throw some shapes at the Europa League too. And we seem to own the FA cup recently. All is far from lost
Lampard, Cole? Give them each a 2 year extension, Cole won't accept just one year so it's logical. Just give Frank what he wants, people will just be down on the chairman and Rafa more then ever and that's not what the club needs.

- Unfortunately, due to lack of funds, we were unable to get a hold of a big screen to display the stream in the venue. However, you are still welcome to come meet the players and dota personalities who will be attending the event.

- The max number of spectators is 20. People who arrive after that will not be allowed inside the venue, so if you are coming from a distance I suggest you arrive early. Spectators will have the choice to leave the venue for a set period of time and return later, if they do not return in time, their reserved spot will be lost.

- Spectators are not allowed to use the PCs at any given time. They are reserved for the teams and staff only.



*We hope to be able to provide a better experience for those wishing to spectate next time, given that we attract more sponsors and/or acquire more funds. Unfortunately, this is how it will have to be in the mean time.*
