When Kelly received the power of time travel she technically shouldn't be able to remember what happened previously such as Curtis not knowing anything until he came back to the current times in his travel.

Me and my friend went out for a few drinks and were going to go to al ocal nightclub. The bouncer would not let us in however because my friend had a tattoo on his neck. The tattoo is taseful enough and my friend was otherwise dressed smartly. 

This felt quite discriminatory because there was no way he could change the fact that he had a tatoo on his neck and yet this was given as the raeson he could not enter a popular local club. 

What is the legal situation with this? It wasn't like he was wearing trainers and could change them to shoes. They were basically saying ""for the rest of your life you can never come in this club because of your tattoo"" is this not discrimination?

**Zabaleta:** Solid performance at the back, not really troubled


**Navas:** Second half sub. Put away the 2-2 equaliser in the 92nd minute. Looked good.

**Negredo:** Looked alright after being subbed on but no real sight of goal.

**Nasri:** Came on in the second to add France's third with a good finish. Changed the game after being subbed on.
 
**Clichy:** Poor game, beaten time and time again. No real attacking threat either.

**Kolarov:** Good cross to set up the first and hit a rocket from 35 yards. If only he could play like this for us...

**Nastasic:** Had Vokes in his pocket all night, showed maturity beyond his years in a good performance.

**Hart:** Made a few good saves but otherwise untroubled. Off his line well and dealt with crosses comfortably.

**Milner:**  Good defensive game, pretty average on the attack though. Worked very hard as usual.

I developed Pocket Alan for iPhone and iPad back in 2009 and it was a huge hit. As a naive youngster, the legality of it kinda passed me by and regrettably I took a ""well everyone else is doing it so why shouldn't I?"" attitude.

As time went on I continued to support the app and always said to myself that should the BBC ever step in and make their own Alan app I will remove it and step aside.

Well last month things changed and BabyCow Productions, the company headed by Steve Coogan and Henry Normal approached me to say that they loved the app and wanted to work with me to make it the official Alan Partridge App. While they have spin offs such as their current radio app. They want Pocket Alan to be the one stop shop for all things Alan.

I still retain creative control and they are working hard to get contracts drawn up to give me access to more content.

For those of you who know of the app or have purchased it (thanks btw). What would you like to see in the app? The core purpose will always be the soundboards and that will never change. At the moment it still features clips from ""I'm Alan Partridge"" and there are plans to add the film clips in when the DVD is released this Christmas. 

But what extra could I do? As a fan I have my own ideas but that's just me. 

I know the interface needs to be massively improved (I never wanted to make it look too official...there's an excuse for laziness if I ever heard one) and I am working with the team to bring it on brand but I open to suggestions as to what layout would be good.

I appreciate that some of you may not be too happy with my past antics with regards to legality but, that is all in the past and has been resolved between myself and the IP holders. It's all about looking forward and getting the best possible mobile Alan experience into the palm of your hands.

If you haven't seen Pocket Alan, you can find the link here:

This is an article by Rohan Silva, and he also points out that up to 2010 the IT spend by the gov was Â£25bn a year (don't know for how long though) and the NHS IT project that was scrapped was actually Â£20bn, not the Â£12bn I thought it had been reported as.

Anyone know who was making the threats?

edit: Here's the paragraph from the article

So I just started Series 5 and I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. I know the production team changed and so things were bound to be a bit different - but absolutely everything has changed. Nothing feels familiar. It doesn't even feel like the same show. Although there were some minor changes, Tennant's Doctor felt like the same character that Eccleston played. But Smith's Doctor seems like a completely different guy! There're no familiar faces to ground the new Doctor, like how Rose was there when Tennant was introduced. It feels a little *too* disjointed, does anyone else feel that way? Like Moffat went a bit too far with the alterations? Changing the opening sequence and the song and everything! Like yeah, the song changed over the first four years, but only very subtly. Now it's completely different. I'm just not sure how I feel about this! Even the lighting and colouring seems off. Does anyone else feel this way? Does it get more connected to the Tennant/Eccleston era, or is it completely new the whole way from now on?

I watched that all the way through to what was currently out then decided to start watching the original series. I was almost derailed once by the reconstructions, because they were so incredibly hard to watch. After stopping for a few months, one day I decided to push on and I never looked back, watching a couple episodes per day, when I could.


Today I watched the Doctor Who Movie, thus coming full circle and completing my journey. Here are some of my thoughts.


**Favorite Doctors**


Rather than rating them all in order, which I don't find to be cut and dry, I've grouped them. Within each group I've listed them chronologically.


**First Group Doctors**

* Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) - The one everyone raves about, and with good reason. He was funny, brilliant, kooky, and great fun. I looked forward to each of his stories.

* Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) - My favorite over all. No explanation needed really.

* Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) - He had a tough act to follow, and he lived up to the task admirably.


**Second Group Doctors**

* Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) - Maybe it was most episodes being in color, but he was more vibrant and flamboyant than the previous two.

* Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) - I was sad to see the Fourth Doctor go, but he was fun, smart, and wickedly clever.

* Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) - I didn't expect to like him (more on that below), but he was a wonderful Doctor. Caring, very charming, silly and a great wit.

* Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) - My first doctor, so he holds a special place. Fun, great witty banter, and very good to his companions.


**Third Group Doctors**

* First Doctor (William Hartnell) - A crotchety old man who gets points for being the first, and I didn't particularly dislike him, but I didn't love his Doctor either. The reconstructions were tough to watch.

* Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) - He was a big change from the first doctor, and I enjoyed his stories. But since most were reconstructions, again it was a chore watching his stories.

* Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann) - There was nothing really wrong with him, and maybe it's because he only had one story, but there just wasn't anything I particularly loved about him.


**Last Group Doctors**

* Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) - He was rude, demeaning, and a total dick. He treated Peri like crap. I hated him.


**Favorite Companions**

* Jamie McCrimmon - A total badass. Strong, brave, and fiercely loyal to The Doctor and his fellow companions.

* Sarah Jane Smith - Not sure what I can say that you don't already know about her. A brilliant, loyal and beautiful companion.

* Romana II - Prettiest companion in my opinion. Also smart, brave and fun to follow along with her journey. Much softer than Romana I.

* Peri - A lovely companion, it's such a shame The Sixth Doctor treated her like shit. I was crushed when I thought she'd been body-swapped with that creature.

* Rose - My first companion. I think I was as much in love with her as The Doctor was. Tragic end to her time with the Doctor, but I think they made up for it in the end.

* Captain Jack - Love that he was such a wildcard, off the wall, brave, complex person. I really enjoyed Torchwood as well.

* Amy Pond - She has such a good heart, and while at first she didn't treat Rory too well, in the end I never doubted her love for him.

* River Song - Most fun character, and I love the way she always seems to know just a little more than The Doctor does.



**Least Favorite Companions**

* Mel - I think it might be unfair to list only Mel in this group from the classic series, but she's freshest in my memory and she was a bit annoying with her constant screaming.

* Mickey - At first I thought it was stupid that there be more than just Rose in the Tardis, having never watched anything else, but he grew on me a bit. He did get shafted when Rose chose the Doctor over him, but things worked out pretty well for him in the end. He became more likable as the episodes went on.

* There were others, but I don't remember them at the present moment.


**Best Surprise**

* I don't know why, maybe because of his look, but I did not expect to like Sylvester McCoy's Doctor at all. Within his first story, however, I was blown away! He was funny, thoughtful, intense, brilliant. I just thoroughly enjoyed every minute of his stories.


**Worst Things**

* The reconstructions were a chore and half. I was derailed once by them, and almost gave up on the series. In the end I'm glad I got through them, but it was a hard thing to do.

* The story of ""The Gunslingers"" had the **worst** narration, and pretty horrible old-Western style American accents.

* Mel's constant screaming.

So, I've now had 5 lessons, 1 1/2 hours each in a manual with Top Class driving school. My instructor is a lady called Ash, and she is teaching me well (I think), but she scares me in a way that reminds me of how I used to feel about my teachers at school.

So my questions are...

- How many lessons did it take for you to be ready for your test?

- How can I combat the nervousness that always causes me to fuck up in lessons?

- Should I be a little scared of my instructor?

- Are there any learning-to-drive tips that I should know?

Very few people knew of Roman Abramovichâs plan to buy Chelsea and I first heard of it in a message on my mobile phone. Elen and I were on holiday in America and were lying by the pool of our Las Vegas hotel when I received an unexpected voicemail. It was Rio. 

âA Russian billionaire is buying Chelsea mate. Iâm tellinâ you. This geezer is seriously rich and can afford any player in the world. Thereâs gonna be big changes. I hope youâre up for a fight âcos youâre gonna have one to stay in the team! Enjoy your hols!â 

Cheers mate. Rio can never resist a wind up and in this case he had the chance of a lifetime. I wasnât sure what to make of it. There had been stories for months about different people investing in the club but Iâd never heard of Roman Abramovich. I wondered about it for a while and then went for a swim. Probably just Rio having a laugh. 

Two days later we were in Los Angeles and the story broke in England that Ken Bates had sold the club to a Russian oil tycoon. I called Dad and Kutner but there was very little hard information and a lot of wild speculation. The only thing for certain was that the new owner of Chelsea was rich â very rich. 

Within days we were linked with the biggest names in the world; Thierry Henry, Ronaldinho, Andriy Shevchenko, Ronaldo â and they were just the strikers. In midfield we were supposed to be buying Emerson from Roma, Steven Gerrard from Liverpool, and David Beckham from Real Madrid. On top of that, Ranieri was to be replaced. 

I called a few people for news and while everything I was being told sounded exciting for Chelsea I wasnât sure what it meant for me, but Iâve never been scared of competition for places in the team and never shirked a challenge. When I returned home I found that the place was already bulging with new signings. Glen Johnson, Adrian Mutu, Wayne Bridge, Damien Duff, Geremi, Hernan Crespo, and Alexei Smertin had joined and there was no sign of it stopping there. I looked at the intake: four midfielders already in, plus Claude Makelele, Juan Sebastian Veron, and Joe Cole still to arrive. Only the seven then. I thought about the situation and decided that I had two choices: I could leave Chelsea or I could become a better footballer. I decided to become a better footballer. 

Mr Abramovich arrived at Harlington a couple of days after we had reported back for pre-season training. We got wind of the visit and everyone was there early (some of the younger players even washed their cars). There was a sense of nervousness around the place and uncertainty about what was about to happen. The man we met though was warm and seemed as anxious as any of us about meeting for the first time. He didnât speak any English but said hello politely to the players and staff. I watched him as he came towards me and was slightly surprised by his appearance. I suppose you imagine rich and powerful people to be very imposing characters but he seemed physically slight and quite shy. 

With him was Eugene Tenenbaum who is his close friend and a director of the club, and a translator. Eugene speaks English as a first language but is fluent in Russian and has worked with Roman a long time. Ranieri was introducing everyone and trying to keep things as relaxed and casual as possible. 

When Mr Abramovich came to shake my hand he smiled. I smiled and said hello as the manager told the new owner my name and position. As he listened he looked directly at me and very fleetingly I caught sight of the determination in his gaze which convinced me he wasnât here for a hobby. Mr Abramovich conducts business to be successful. He doesnât like to lose. 

I also liked his style. He took one look at the rickety old set-up of the training ground with its partitioned changing rooms and grubby canteen and pronounced it to be âreally shitâ. I donât know how to say that in Russian but he was absolutely right. He immediately instructed a search for a new site and for a purpose-built complex to be constructed. 

Iâve been told he was in his helicopter helping to hunt for a suitable piece of land when they flew over Hyde Park. 

âWhat about there?â he is supposed to have asked. 

âYou canât sir. The Queen owns it.â 

âWonât she sell?â 

The story has become a bit of an urban myth but the sentiment is accurate enough â Mr Abramovich will stop at almost nothing to get what he wants. There didnât seem to be any limit on the transfer budget and by the time we lined up for the first Premiership game of the season at Anfield there were six new faces in the squad, five of whom started the match. Everyone was feeling the pressure as we gathered in the Anfield tunnel. Ranieri didnât refer to the new owner in his team-talk, his focus remaining on the players and the club. He was trying to take our minds off the fact that we were now regarded as the richest club in the world and one which couldnât afford to fail. 

It was a tough game, though. Veron put us in the lead in the first half and it looked for a long time that we would get the Abramovich revolution off to a winning start as the whole of planet football waited to see what would happen. Then disaster â Michael Owen equalized with a penalty and the day was deflated, until, that is, Jimmy netted with three minutes left. We ran to celebrate with him but the image which will live longest in my mind from that game was the one I saw later that evening on TV. The camera panned to the directorsâ box after the second goal went in and there was Roman Abramovich jumping out of his seat and exchanging high fives with the other club officials. I thought, âHeâll do for me.â 

The second match of the campaign was just as memorable, though it was not for Chelsea. England met Croatia in a friendly at Ipswich on the following Wednesday night and I was fired up for it, not just because of the events of the previous weekend but mainly because I could sense a change in fortune in my international career. There had been a run of games over that summer which included friendlies against South Africa in May and then Serbia and Montenegro in June, followed by a Euro qualifier against Slovakia. Over that period I had managed to force my way into the reckoning with England, and in return, Eriksson had shown real confidence in me for the first time. 

The trip itself was out of the ordinary. Travelling so far at the end of a long season for an exhibition match seemed strange, as was the opportunity to meet Nelson Mandela. It hadnât been on our schedule and didnât seem to be particularly well organized. We were sitting on the coach after training, two days before the match, and we were simply asked if we wanted to go. It meant getting up at 6 am to be on a flight from Durban to Johannesburg. I respect Mandela for what he has done and though he is not a particular hero of mine I felt I should go to represent England. The game was the next day and I would have preferred to prepare properly, and a lot of lads didnât go because of that. In the end I was glad that I went. Mandela came across as a very friendly man. It was a very humbling experience and it dawned on me that I was in the presence of someone who had made history by achieving amazing things for others. Thatâs real celebrity. It was also quite an amusing occasion because Rio jumped to the front when we were being introduced, and in the photo I have heâs sitting beside Mandela holding his hand. Rio was so excited, just like the big kid he can be. 

As for the game against South Africa, I played the last half hour, made a goal, and generally did well despite seeing a St Georgeâs flag in the stand with âWHUâ (West Ham United) on it and a fat geezer caning me when I was warming up. Greeted by Nelson Mandela, international statesman, one day, slagged off by an ignorant football fan, the next â what a life. We won 2â1, and I realize now that my performance in South Africa was the turning point of my England career. 

The midfield four which had played in the World Cup the year before was still going strong but the chance to prove myself came in the first match after the tournament. David Beckham had broken his arm and wasnât fit and so I made my first start under Eriksson in the Serbia game. I played quite well but knew it wasnât enough and the question leading up to the Slovakia match in Middlesbrough was whether Jermaine Jenas or I would replace Beckham in the team. I got the nod but my happiness was tempered by the fact that I would start on the left of a midfield diamond. Anyone who plays on the left of midfield for England has to deal with the fact that no matter how well you play you will always be told that youâre not the answer to the countryâs problems there. Despite what JT thought about my performances on the wing for Chelsea, I didnât really deserve the tag âGiggsyâ. 

It was a big moment for me â starting a qualifying match. The manager had put his trust in me for an important game and I appreciated the responsibility. I was prepared for it and felt I was passing well in an open formation. Then we went a goal down. I walked from the pitch at half-time dreading the prospect of losing and everyone putting it down to the fact that Beckham didnât play and I did. Too much negative thinking â so I got my head down and spirits up and went out for the second half believing we would turn it round. Michael Owen scored twice, impressing on me what kind of player he is â someone special, someone with the ability to score goals when theyâre needed most. 

Paul Scholes was another special talent. He was always the best trainer with England and one of the best players I have ever seen. Heâs razor sharp all of the time, passes the ball so quickly and accurately, and shoots with explosive power. In fact, heâs possibly the best finisher in the business. As an attacking midfielder I looked at him and wondered if I would ever get to that level. There was a period when he didnât score for England and it was made into a big issue but what people overlooked in that scenario was that you make a rod for your own back when you have a habit of getting goals from midfield. Iâve suffered from it as well. People begin to expect it from you even though you donât get anywhere near the same number of opportunities as some strikers who might also be in a goal drought. 

Iâve been called âineffectiveâ because I didnât score in a particular match which can be annoying since it ignores everything else I may have contributed. In the England set-up, Scholesy was the forward point of the diamond which had Nicky Butt at the base and I remember while I was playing for the Under-21s, Peter Taylor taking me aside for a chat. 

âI see you playing the holding role long-term, Frank,â he said. 

âWhat are you talking about? I donât want to play there,â I replied. âIt goes against my instinct. I like to get forward and attack. Itâs the player I am.â 

âNo. I see you developing into a holding player and maybe going forward occasionally from deep. Youâve got to think about where you will best be able to flourish.â 

I did, and I knew it was as an attacking midfielder. Maybe Peter Taylor was looking at Scholesy and thought I didnât have much chance of unseating him in the senior team and that changing tack was a better option for making the step up. But I had no interest in playing deep and was determined to make myself into the player I had always envisaged I could be. 

I had three years between my first and second caps so I wasnât short of time to consider my options. Stevie Gerrard was relatively inexperienced then but in my eyes had already made himself a first-choice pick for England. Beckham was captain and playing very well and generally speaking the lads who were in the team were the biggest obstacles to me getting a chance. I appreciated that they were the best we had and to make an impact I would have to prove myself to be better. That didnât put me off, though I was becoming more aware all the time that international football could be even more fickle than playing for your club. Playing for England can be the best thing in football but it can also be the worst. There is little better feeling than representing your country and doing well. However, youâre often pitted against smaller nations in potentially mundane games and if you are not completely aware and sharp then you can get punished.

Technically they are often much better than the public perception of them. I can understand the public expectation because of the players England have, but international football is not as simple as big team beats little team. The crowd is edgy at those games right from the start â urging you to get forward, score goals, and play entertaining football â but the truth of the matter is that when you open yourself up naively like that you can get picked off and concede goals. Examples of this type of scenario are the Macedonia game at home â when we drew 2â2 â and then the Slovakia match at the Riverside. 

It annoys me when people say or write that England should be convincingly beating this team or that because this ignores the reality of modern international football. I learned from playing under foreign coaches at Chelsea and playing with other internationals that you have to be sharper than your opponent. When I was at West Ham I would probably have agreed with the bulldog gung-ho spirit of âup and at âemâ but that attitude will only get you so far against most teams and will see you torn apart by good ones like Brazil or Argentina. 

You know what to expect of the big nations but my point about the smaller ones is illustrated by the example of players who look very good with their international sides but are less impressive when they join a Premiership club. Thatâs because international football is slower and more technical by nature. You need to have the skill and the mentality to succeed in both. 

I felt much more confident around the England scene as a result of the games that summer and by the time we got to the Croatia match I was buzzing. It told in my performance when I came on as sub for Nicky Butt and scored my first goal. The contest was unspectacular but there are few sweeter moments in football than when you let fly from twenty-five yards and know the ball is going in from the moment it leaves your boot. It is even sweeter when youâre wearing the Three Lions. So what it wasnât a competitive match? I was off the mark for England and my self-belief was strengthened going into the game against Macedonia the following month. 

For the Macedonia game I was asked to play at the front of the diamond in midfield, which can be a tough position to get right. You spend much of the time with your back to goal collecting the ball and trying to link players. Playing behind the strikers has traditionally been the domain of the skilful ânumber 10â type â someone who is essentially a striker but whose ability is not limited to scoring goals. Diego Maradona is the finest example and for me the greatest player who ever lived. I am no Maradona (as Harry once pointed out) but what I have is something different â an ability to make play from deeper positions and then arrive at the right time around the box to have a crack at goal. 

I felt slightly isolated at times in Skopje but I was doing all right. Obviously the manager felt differently. I was subbed at half-time. I hate being taken off at any stage in a match but this was just embarrassing. We were a goal down at the time and Eriksson felt he had to make changes. He brought on Rooney to play in the hole and the team went on to win 2â1. I was glad we won but gutted to be off the pitch. The manager subsequently said to the press that I had done well but he had to change it round to try and force a goal. This was a fair enough point but it wasnât much consolation for me. However, on the flight home I got a boost from the England captain. 

I hadnât had much interaction with Becks until that point and when I first came into the squad I was a little in awe of him. I was still a young kid then and he was already a superstar. This sense of distance between us lasted for quite some time. But while I was sitting on the plane poring over the details of the game in my head and working out where I had gone right and wrong, Becks came and sat beside me. 

âYou all right Lamps?â he asked. 

âYeah. Okay. Iâm pleased we won but a bit pissed off to be pulled at half-time,â I said. 

âI know what you mean. You shouldnât be too down though, because you played well and youâve been doing really well for England and Chelsea. People get dragged off much more easily in international football than at club level and it happens. Donât get too down on yourself, your moment will come.â 

We chatted for a few minutes but it wasnât so much what he said but the fact that he made the effort which encouraged me. He was kind and supportive and I suppose playing the part of a good captain. It broke the ice between us because he is quite a shy person, like myself, and ever since then we have got on very well and I have felt much more involved. I was pleased for the support and finally began to feel a part of the England set-up rather than just âa bodyâ. 

I played in the victory over Liechtenstein four days later when, unsurprisingly, we got some stick for only winning 2â0; but on the next occasion I met up with the squad I discovered what life with the national team was like when a firestorm breaks out off the pitch. It came like a bolt from the blue and had a significant impact. 

On the morning I was due to meet up with the players for the match against Turkey news broke that Rio had missed a drugs test at Manchester United and had been kicked out the squad. I had no prior warning from Rio or anyone else, not even a rumour that something was wrong. I arrived at the team hotel and found that a meeting of the players had been called to discuss the situation. 

The United lads were obviously much better informed than most of us and Gary Neville was the most vociferous in his support of Rio, though the other United lads were very much behind him â backing up all that was said. The room was quiet and everyone was tense. None of us had ever known anything like it and while I would support Rio in every way possible, I genuinely didnât know what practical steps to take. Gary got on his feet and addressed the squad. 

âHere are the facts,â he said. 

âRio missed a drugs test at Carrington [Manchester Unitedâs training ground] because he had already left, having forgotten that heâd been chosen to give a sample for testing. He remembered that afternoon and went back to take the test but was told that the officials had already left. The problem we face is that as a result of making an honest mistake heâs been dropped from this squad and effectively found guilty of breaking the rules before any investigation has taken place.â 

âFucking hell, Rio, you stupid bastard.â 

I had a lot of sympathy for Rio but after the shock of reading about it in the morning, the possible consequences were now beginning to sink in. Rio could miss the Turkey match, but he could also miss the rest of the season â and Euro 2004. 

Gary opened up the discussion and the lads agreed that there appeared to be a miscarriage of justice. We wanted to know what we could do about it. The United lads raised the idea that we should boycott the Turkey match in support of our team-mate. I wasnât so sure. I agreed that it was important to display unity but it was a very difficult situation since the âenemyâ we were fighting were the Football Association, who had decided on this course of action. 

âThe one thing we can do to let them know how strongly we feel about this is to go on strike,â Gary continued. 

âWe should all think about whether or not we go to play in Turkey.â 

When I actually heard the words I was shocked. Yes, we had an opportunity to make an important statement about how we felt and take the stand we felt was appropriate. I looked around the room though and saw a lot of expressions which suggested surprise, apprehension, or just a lack of understanding of what all of this meant. I was behind the idea but I think most lads were simply swept along on a tide of high emotion. Gary had given a very passionate speech and had the support of the players in principle but Iâm not sure any of us had really considered the implications of following through with the threat. 

Nevertheless, the FA were made aware of developments and word came back that they were not prepared to negotiate. The delegation of four which makes up the playersâ committee met with the chief executive of the FA, Mark Palios, and returned very angry. The official response was that if we went on strike then they would pick another twenty players who were prepared to turn out against Turkey and scab on the rest of us. I didnât know Mark Palios very well but he always struck me as quite an arrogant person. I would have hoped that someone in his position would have tried harder to relate to the players and understand where we were coming from. Surely thatâs one of the most important aspects of his job. Instead, he preferred to swan around giving it the big âI amâ which irked me and most of the lads. 

In fact, Mark Palios wasnât so very special, not special at all. The chief executive didnât have to make himself out to be the most important person at the FA. He could have gone about his business quietly and efficiently and left the manager and the players to get on with team affairs. He shouldâve stuck to his own area of responsibility. 
None of this helped the situation. Rio was out â end of story. Mr Eriksson called the players together later the same day, having spoken with some of us already. He knew what was being considered and to be fair he found himself in an impossible situation. He had always been steadfastly behind his players but on the other hand he had to try and put across the view of his employers â the FA. 

âLook, I completely understand your point of view on this,â he said.

âAnd I think that you should support each other at all times. I admire that quality in you and I know that the team and me as your manager benefits from this unity. I think that the stance you are taking is morally correct but we have another problem and that is that we have to play a very important game against Turkey. 

âIf we donât, then all of the hard work we have put in so far will be in danger as will our chance to play at the European Championships. You must remember that is at stake as well as what you are fighting for.â 

At this point a deadlock had been reached. Rio wasnât coming back into the squad and when some of the players started to talk amongst themselves about what might happen next there was a realization of what the consequences could be. We had been chosen to represent our country, to play for England in the match which would decide our fate in Euro 2004. And what about the fans, the ordinary people who supported us? We also had to consider the implications, both immediate and long-term, for all of us. 

By this time the media were having a field day. Papers printed head shots of the players and branded us âtraitorsâ. It was all getting out of hand. I was pissed off at being so labelled by people who expected us to show strength and togetherness on the field â and I mean the FA and the media. And yet we were supposed to abandon a team-mate who was innocent? 

No chance. 

We were due to fly to Istanbul on the Thursday before Saturdayâs game and the talk was of the flight being delayed while discussions went on. By the Wednesday evening I was convinced that there wouldnât be a strike. I understood the concept of using the strike as a threat, but I couldnât see it going beyond that. Even so, Iâm sure there were some players who were prepared to go all the way. In the end, we got together and a consensus emerged that it was better to play the match, achieve the result which would see us qualify automatically, and then deal with the issue of Rio later. He would miss this game but we had a debt to him to make sure we got to Portugal so that he might at least have the chance to play there. 

It was reported that Rio had sent a text asking us not to strike for his sake but to my knowledge that wasnât the case. I certainly didnât receive it or hear of it. He did send a text to some of the lads on the Thursday morning, when it had been decided we would go and play wishing us good luck and urging us to get a result. Rio was happy with the way the situation had been resolved partly because had we gone on strike he would have been the reason for a national scandal. No one wants that responsibility. 

Everyone was predicting that the shambles which had characterized the preparation would have negative consequences on the pitch. In fact it had the opposite effect: the atmosphere at training the day before the match was intense; you could tell there was a sense of injustice felt by every player as the tackles flew in. The practice match was as competitive as I have ever seen it. Fuck them. Fuck them all, was the attitude we adapted. We would get a result to spite everyone who doubted us, everyone who slagged us off or questioned our loyalty to our country. Of course, against Turkey that is exactly the kind of fighting spirit which is going to make a difference. Their fans are hostile, their players adept at winding you up, but in our frame of mind we could match any such aggravation with a siege mentality that Jose Mourinho would have been proud of. 

Becks missed a penalty but unlike his left foot, it didnât feel like anything had slipped away from us. JT came in for Rio and played brilliantly, blocking everything and anything in the way only John can. Emile Heskey got involved in a ruck going down the tunnel at half-time after being racially abused â I didnât see the fight but got there in time to be told that Emile had laid out one of the Turkey lads. Nice one. 

I had never been involved in a team which qualified for the finals of a tournament and even though I only came on late as a sub, it was a fantastic feeling. All of the anger, anxiety, and bitterness which had built up over the previous days evaporated the moment the final whistle went. Weâd won the group and were jubilant â we were going to Portugal. I wondered what Rio was doing at that moment and what he thought.",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,Super Frank on the Roman Empire - Part 2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1m7bt3/super_frank_on_the_roman_empire_part_2/

I also know what he subsequently suffered through the months of the ban when he couldnât play. People donât know how hard that was for him, how lonely he was. Itâs the worst feeling in the world, training all week and knowing there will be no game at the weekend. I have only experienced this when coming back from injury and itâs torture. Rio could have gone off on a world tour, or gone off the rails, or just gone off football. He deserves great credit for the way he trained so hard all those months and for the manner in which he returned to play. Rio has endured much scrutiny and expectation from a very young age because of his phenomenal talent and it has meant that every little aspect of his fitness, form, and the like is analysed as if it was some issue of national importance. That was the time of his greatest trouble and he survived â now he is prospering. 

When I heard he had been hit with an eight-month ban I was angry. It was stated that a missed test is treated the same as a positive one but that is ridiculous. There was no proof to convict Rio of anything except being forgetful and I can vouch for his bad memory. When you consider that Mark Bosnich got fourteen months and Mutu ten months having admitted taking cocaine, Rioâs treatment is a scandal by comparison. The rules say that people found guilty can be banned for life. If they are guilty then why are they not banned for life? I donât understand â surely drastic punishment is the only way to prevent more cases arising? 

Then again, proper testing would help resolve the problem. I know how these drug tests are conducted and they can be a complete shambles. When I had tests at West Ham and in my early Chelsea days, you were nominated to give a sample after training, but when you go and have a shower itâs entirely plausible that people could forget and leave without completing the task. The procedure has been tightened up a little now after Rioâs case but Iâve heard stories about players missing a test on purpose, with their club or team-mates covering for them. No names were mentioned but the method was always the same. If these reports are true, itâs clearly possible to miss a test on purpose and if so, then itâs surely possible to miss one by accident. Itâs the responsibility of the people who conduct the test to make sure itâs carried out â itâs their job; ours is to play football. 

Had Rio refused to take the test and left the training ground having made that clear then he would have been guilty of avoiding the test but that was not the case. From my experience the whole programme â not the tests carried out by individual clubs but the official ones done by the football authorities â is very unprofessional and often sloppy. The tests are not carried out frequently enough, nor is there any consistency. I appreciate that the element of surprise is necessary but the structure as it stands is ineffective in terms of properly policing the game. There is a randomness which borders on negligence â a player could be tested twice in one month or only once in three years. Surely every player should be tested at least once a month or even more? Also, the tests should be conducted with more regulation such as, for example, a player being taken to a specific area after training and only being allowed to leave after the sample has been produced. I would happily be tested every week or every day if it meant reassuring people that football is clean. It would also help prevent stupid stories and gossip spreading about players taking drugs. 

One such episode involved me when some kid who played at Cardiff claimed that five Premiership players were using drugs. He predictably sold his story to a paper, which printed the allegations without naming the players, despite also claiming to be âa friendâ of those involved. After a couple of days rumours were rife that I was one of the footballers accused. This guy claimed that he had been on a night out with me and a few others and caught us doing drugs in the toilet. What utter bollocks. I rang one of the other players who was supposed to have been involved and he told me that the guy making the accusations was someone Rio knew from way back and who tagged along on a couple of nights out with us. I vaguely remembered the geezer but had never even spoken to him. What he had alleged wasnât just scandalous â it was potentially very damaging and totally fabricated. Since then there have been other rumours about me and other players doing drugs but the truth is that people just make this stuff up to try and make money or make themselves look important. I was even told that some website claimed I was gay. Elen will be shocked, not to mention Luna. 

Itâs not just the individuals peddling this crap who are to blame. There comes a time when we have to examine ourselves and a society that encourages people to manufacture malicious stories about footballers or anyone else in the public eye in order to make money. There was a case when Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape in a newspaper and interrogated by police only for the story to be exposed as complete rubbish about a month later. An accusation of a sexual crime can be as damaging to someoneâs character as a conviction yet there was no evidence to suggest that in this case there had been any wrongdoing whatsoever. Ronaldo has to live with that accusation for life but what happened to the person who made up the story in the first place? Nothing except receiving money for telling lies. 

Newspapers encourage this behaviour by offering money to people for âkiss and tellâ stories or even worse. I know that some stories published are true but others are just plain lies. I have always taken a keen interest in the media and how it works in all aspects. As a footballer, though, you develop a thick skin about some of the things that are written. Itâs flattering and satisfying to be praised in print but there are other articles which require a much more pragmatic approach. Personal criticism, team criticism and general gossip written about the club and the manager are all things which you learn to live with and mostly ignore. Some players do this by just not reading the papers at all. Itâs fair to say that Iâm the opposite. 
I regularly read a variety of newspapers, taking in what is of interest to me in both the front and back. At the start of the 2003/04 season, it seemed that Chelsea and Mr Abramovich were making an impressive takeover bid for column inches. Stories on transfers began to calm down to an average of around just five a day and the focus had shifted to the manager. We were used to this coverage by that time and Ranieri decided not to make a big deal of it. He made the odd joke in press conferences but had ignored the speculation in dealing with the players. 

However, as the new season approached, more and more articles began to appear about the possibility of Sven-Goran Eriksson taking over at Chelsea. It was one story which refused to go away and, generally speaking, that alone seemed to give it a measure of credibility. I spoke about it a bit with JT, Eidur, and Jody but we were all long in the tooth enough to know that there was nothing we could do so just had to get our heads down and get on with it. 

Things changed on the morning that pictures were published of Eriksson arriving at Mr Abramovichâs house with the well-known agent Pini Zahavi. It had transpired that Zahavi had played a part in putting the Chelsea buy out deal together (he is also Rioâs personal agent, hence the voicemail by the pool in Vegas) so now we knew there was substance to the Eriksson story. I arrived for training wondering what to expect. 

Ranieri was already at Harlington and passed me at the entrance to the changing room. âGood morning Frank!â The greeting was very normal though there was a slight quiver in his voice. I did my best to ignore it but I could sense the strange atmosphere around the place. We tried to carry on with training in the normal fashion and when it was concluded, Ranieri made sure that everyone would be upstairs for lunch after changing. I walked up the four flights of stairs with legs as heavy as if I had completed a ten-mile run. Once we were all seated Ranieri stood at the front of our tables and there was a sudden and eerie silence. This was it. 

âI know what you are thinking,â he began. âAnd I donât blame you after what you will have seen and read. All that I can tell you is that I have spoken with the owner and he has told me that I have a job here. He has told me that this is my team and what he expects of me and you this season. 

âI am telling you that this is my job and you are my team. Letâs ignore the things on the outside and concentrate on what we know and who we know. We are Chelsea â you and me, all of us. Letâs remember that and do our jobs.â 

I was half tempted to clap him but it didnât seem quite appropriate. They were brave words â words he would repeat throughout the season, not because he wanted to reassure us but because he felt he had to. Even after Eriksson was forced to admit the fact of the meeting with Abramovich and reaffirm his commitment to the England job, it did not remove the axe which hovered above Ranieriâs head. He was, as he would very succinctly put it later on, âa dead man walkingâ.
 
I had a lot of sympathy for Ranieri because of what he had helped me achieve in terms of my game and my career. I knew that a new owner of any business will naturally want to install his own man to run that concern but there was a bond between Ranieri and the players. I spoke to JT and Eidur about it and we agreed that we should continue to show the same loyalty to the manager that he had always shown us. Whenever we were asked in the media about Ranieri we supported him and reiterated our feeling that he was the right man to manage Chelsea. Itâs what we believed in our hearts and minds and I think that unity shone through that season. 

We qualified for the group stage of the Champions League with ease but the experience had gone sour when we arrived in Prague to play Sparta in the opening match. The game itself was not the problem â it was what had happened well before kick-off in the team hotel. Ranieri announced the starting line-up and to my amazement, John, Eidur, and me were all on the bench. At first I thought there must have been a mistake or maybe it was a joke. For one of us to have been dropped would have been disappointing, two would have been serious, but three was surely taking the piss. Our places were taken by the new boys â the children of the revolution as it were â seven in all, as the old guard gave way. 

I stormed out of the meeting room, closely followed by John and Eidur. âFuck this,â I said, âI worked my arse off last season to get this club into the Champions League â we all did â and Iâm sure as hell not going to park it on the bench while the newcomers get to play. I was livid â as angry as I have ever been about a team selection. I went to my room and telephoned Elen.
 
âIâve been dropped, babe,â I said, still seething.

âWhat?â 

âIâm not kidding. Iâm on the bench â and so are Eidur and John.â 

âCalm down, Frank. Whatâs going on?â 

âIâll tell you whatâs going on â I could be leaving Chelsea because thereâs no way Iâm spending a season on the bench to accommodate anyone else at the club.â 

âFrank, calm down. Letâs see what happens in the game and weâll talk when you get home.â 

She was right but I was too steamed up to see it. I went to Eidurâs room to try to find an answer, but the only one apparent was that the new players had been bought to replace us. 

âI wish the fucking revolution had never started,â I said, exasperated. 

âI would happily take the old days now. At least we got a game,â replied Eidur. 

Usually when you put me together with my mates Eidur and John, weâll share a joke and have a laugh but that night the bench was more like hell on earth â full of despair and loathing. On the pitch the team struggled, and I canât say I was disappointed. Ranieri told me to get stripped at the break and I came on for the second half, as we went on to achieve a 1â0 victory. John and Eidur remained on the bench. 
We still talk about that night â although it proved to be a one-off â not because any of us believe we have a divine right to be in the team but because we had all worked so hard to get the club to that level of competition that we thought we had earned a chance to carry the team further.

We then travelled to play a game in hand against Birmingham City knowing that a win would take us to the top of the league. It ended a draw but, ironically, we still went ahead on goal difference despite the fact we hadnât actually scored that night. I went for a warm-down feeling less elated than you might think given that we were leading the title race. I felt worse when I read Ranieriâs feelings on the achievement. 

âTop of the league is not important,â he told the papers. âMaybe we can be a little bit pleased but not much.â It was typical Claudio â failing to accentuate the positive and praising performance rather than what was gleaned from it. That was his way and we were used to it but once again I wondered if this was the right way to go about winning a league title. 

We played Arsenal the following weekend and while the lads were up for it the result went against us â again. We had enjoyed our lofty status for a whole four days and would not get to know the feeling again as Arsene Wengerâs side embarked upon one of the most amazing feats in English football history in claiming the title without losing a match. We never gave up on the Premiership, though, and had other irons in the fire. Peter Kenyon had been poached from Manchester United to become chief executive and immediately warned us that we were expected to win at least one trophy. So far, we were going well in two, with the FA Cup still to come. 

The Champions League was becoming something of an adventure for us. We were steely to beat Sparta Prague before everyone predicted more European embarrassment after Besiktas came to our place and scored twice. It was a warning we heeded. I scored home and away against Lazio and we found a rhythm in Europe which I had never known before. We qualified comfortably for the knockout round where we defeated VfB Stuttgart over two legs by scoring the only goal of the tie in Germany. 

When we were on the pitch I could look around me and feel a genuine sense of optimism about the team. We had quality in every position and were delivering a level of consistency in results which we hadnât managed in my time at the club. Franco Zola was a joy to play with and we had a few big characters in the team who knew what it took to win major trophies. My only worry was that I remained to be convinced that we would. A lot of players had arrived and some had fitted in better than others but there still seemed to me to be a disparity about the squad which somehow didnât suggest that we could achieve something special. Chelsea had a reputation for recruiting players who were individual talents rather than building a cohesive team. Some people will blame the manager for that but I honestly donât think he was solely responsible. You can only sign the people you think will benefit the club as a whole and some of the players who arrived were only interested in themselves once they got there. 

For all that, we were more together than I had ever known and when we discovered we would play Arsenal in the quarter-final of the Champions League the whole country went mad. They were, of course, still unbeaten and in fact had eliminated us from the FA Cup as well as inflicting another league defeat at the Bridge three weeks before we were due to meet in Europe. It was billed as âThe Battle of Britainâ in the media and to us it was a contest we desperately wanted to win â for ourselves, for the manager, and for Chelsea. Britain could wait â this was about pride and the chance to get to a European Cup semi-final for the first time in our history. 

It was also becoming a bit of a crusade on our behalf for Ranieri. Speculation about his position had intensified regardless of results and I could see it beginning to have an effect on his demeanor. I wasnât surprised. Given the immense pressure heâd been under it would have been hard for anyone to remain unchanged. Throughout that season he had periodically repeated his speech about his commitment to the job. When he sensed we needed reassurance he would kick in with a pledge that he was here to stay. He wasnât the only one under pressure but he always accepted responsibility for what happened on the pitch. 

It seemed that ever since Roman Abramovich committed his first million to the club we had spent each day under the public microscope. Everything had been questioned: from our ability to what we earned, from our character to the record of our manager. We had answered some of the questions but now we had the chance to silence everyone, a chance to beat the invincibles. 

The players were as pumped up as the fans for the match and Raneiri was as determined as any of us. Predictable stories of âwin or youâre outâ had appeared in the build-up and while he didnât feel the need to deny them, something fundamental shifted in his resistance. It was barely evident but certainly detectable â not so much what he said as the way he said it. His mood, and the vibe about what was going on, changed. He hadnât surrendered â no way â but he was more resigned than ever to the fact that every game in which he was in charge of Chelsea was one closer to the day he would leave. I asked Eidur and JT if they were sensing the same thing and we knew then that this would be our last big push for Claudio Ranieri. 

The Bridge was alight with excitement as we kicked off against Arsenal but we couldnât deliver the victory we and the fans craved. Eidur put us ahead but the lead didnât last long when Robert Pires equalized. To add insult, Marcel was sent off in the closing minutes and suspended for the return leg. It was hardly a disaster but everyone outside of our team seemed to think that victory was now a formality for Arsenal at Highbury. Given how they had been playing, I suppose that was an easy conclusion to draw. Mr Abramovich paid his now customary visit to the dressing room after the game. He was very upbeat, told everyone how well theyâd played, and that he knew we would do well in the second leg. I was grateful for his enthusiasm. We then thrashed Wolves and had a morale-boosting win over Spurs before the return Arsenal game and when the day of reckoning arrived we were more than ready. 

Ranieri addressed us with an unprecedented degree of passion. He emphasized what we might achieve if we could put Arsenal out of the competition, that we had a chance to make history â a chance that doesnât come along too often. His Roman ancestors would have been proud of him because we walked into that arena like gladiators prepared to fight to the death. 

It was just as well, since the tempo of the match would have caused some people to drop. It was as fierce a battle as I had known though we held our own in midfield and were a bit unlucky when Jose Antonio Reyes gave them the lead. Within six minutes we were level though I was so focused on victory, celebrating my goal wasnât a priority. Extra-time seemed a certainty but the manager had come to the touchline and urged us to double up on the flanks and get in behind them. Arsenal had a habit of allowing their full-backs freedom to get forward and we had discussed negating that with runs of our own. With three minutes left, Wayne Bridge found himself running diagonally at the Arsenal goal. I was following on behind, hoping for a cut back. He left Lauren behind and ran towards the box. I could see a couple of blue shirts arriving in front of me. âPass it Bridgey, Pass it!â He didnât pass, nor did he cut it back to the edge of the area â he just drove it into the net all on his own. Bridgey, you beauty. We went wild â piled on top of each other with our new hotshot at the centre of it. When I looked round I saw the coaching staff embracing each other. We didnât have to wait too long to do the same. 

I walked towards the tunnel feeling overjoyed and exhausted. Our fans were celebrating one of the most important wins in our history and you would have needed a surgeon to take the smile off my face. Then I saw Ranieri: he was on the pitch greeting us as we headed for the dressing room. He was laughing â I think â but the strain was showing more than ever. He hugged me. 

âWe did it Frank! We did it! Fantastic! Fantastic!â he said. 

I drew back and looked him square in the face and thatâs when I knew for sure it was over. A single tear ran down his cheek as he held my arms. He was happy but he wasnât crying from joy. His tears were for a part of his life that was coming to an end, for the effort he had expended and the knowledge that no matter how hard he tried he would not be allowed to finish the job he started. 

We went on to play AS Monaco in the semi-final. Rumours were rife that Kenyon had already met with Jose Mourinho and Didier Deschamps about replacing Ranieri the following season. Mourinho was also in the semi-final where his Porto side would play Deportivo La Coruna while Deschamps â a former Chelsea player â was in charge of our opponents. Our current coach deserved a lot of credit for the fastidious manner in which he kept on doing his job. No amount of pressure or gossip could distract him from guiding the club to a potentially historic climax that season. 

We arrived in Monte Carlo for the first leg and during a walk along the marina we saw Mr Abramovichâs boat which was moored in the harbour. Even by the standard of the âmonstersâ worth millions which are a familiar sight in Monaco, his vessel was impressive. In fact, it made the others look like tugs compared to a luxury cruise ship. It was quite a sight and brought home to us just how powerful a man Mr Abramovich is. We were aware of the pressure mounting on Ranieri but whatever was to happen to the manager none of us looked at Roman as the bad guy â in fact he was Chelseaâs saviour. We knew how close we had come to going bust and the truth is that without Roman Abramovich the club might not have been in existence, never mind competing in the semi-final of the European Cup. The new owner had inherited the players and the manager. He wasnât responsible for us being there but it was his prerogative as to what to do next. 

Hopefully, winning the Champions League might convince him we were worth our wages! 

What happened the following night, however, left us all shocked and very much down and out. We started well and were pretty much in control of the match. Even when they scored Crespo pulled one back and we looked balanced and able to cope with whatever was thrown at us â everything, that is, from Monaco. The origin of our downfall was our own dressing room and it started at the break. 

âSeba! Get stripped and warm up. Youâre going on,â Ranieri said to Veron. 

âBut boss. Iâm not ready to play. Iâm not fit enough,â came the reply. 
Those of us who heard this exchange were dumbstruck. Veron had been carrying a slight injury but was fit enough for the bench and never made any complaint when he was named among the subs. It was a bit late, therefore, to be protesting. 

âSeba! Get stripped. Youâre going on for Jesper.â 

I turned to Eidur who looked at me in dismay. Jesper hadnât been amazing in the first half but he was having one of those games where he had the beating of his man. Besides, who would go wide left? 

Apparently Veron. 

We returned to the pitch in a state of disarray. None of us could understand what was going on. We had been comfortable but now we had a man on the pitch who wasnât fit in his mind even if he was in body. It got better when Andreas Zikos was sent off but it quickly got worse again, shambolic actually. Jimmy was brought on for Mario Melchiot and Scotty Parker was sent to right-back. Jimmy jogged over to his position shrugging his shoulders as I asked him what was going on. A few minutes later, Scotty was dragged off for Robert Huth and I had a bad feeling that it was all going pear-shaped. I wasnât wrong. 
We could have nailed that match. We were 1â1 â with an away goal â and they had only ten men. We were twenty minutes away from having one foot in the final. Instead we lost 3â1 and no one knew how. Apart from the boots being discarded, the dressing room was very quiet. I sat in a daze. Jimmy was the first to speak.

âWhat the fuck happened there?â he said. 

No one spoke because we were all asking ourselves the same question. Perhaps Ranieri had an answer but if he did, he didnât volunteer it. He later confessed that it was his worst forty-five minutes in charge of Chelsea. That was obvious. He was known as the âTinker Manâ but that was the most tinkering he had ever done while I was at the club. 

It was also the most bizarre match Iâve ever played in and because it was so unusual people began to ask if the manager had deliberately sabotaged the team as some kind of advance revenge for his impending departure. I canât provide an explanation even now but I would hate to think that was the case. It was not in his character to be so devious or destructive with his own team. Claudio was also a man of great integrity who took pride in his work â the idea that he would undermine it was unthinkable. 

The second leg became a formality. I donât think we had recovered from what happened in the first game and despite scoring twice we managed to concede two and Monaco went through to the final. The remaining couple of weeks of the season is a blur. Ranieri was given a heroâs send-off at the Bridge on the last day and despite telling the fans he hoped to see them again he knew that when he did he would not be Chelsea manager. It would have been nice if he could have said goodbye to the players face to face but instead it ended with a phone call because the season had finished and most of us were already with international sides preparing for Euro 2004. 

I am very grateful to Ranieri for what he did for me: for having the faith to spend Â£11 million to sign me; for taking me under his guidance and making me a better player; for taking Chelsea to the brink of success without actually tasting it himself. A few days after the final Premiership match I turned on the TV and watched the Champions League Final. I was curious. I am sure that we would have won it that year had we beaten Monaco but I was impressed with the way Porto destroyed the team which put us out. 

At the end, I watched the players celebrate in front of delirious fans and saw Jose Mourinho accept his medal and then leave the pitch to allow his team to take the plaudits. He had just won the biggest prize in club football but he had the look of a man who was already hungry for more success.",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,Super Frank on the Roman Empire - Part 4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1m7ccr/super_frank_on_the_roman_empire_part_4/

I'm moving from Canada to Birmingham for my Masters degree in a week and am trying to plan a day trip to London with my mom while she is visiting with me.  Based on the changing of the guard schedule and our other plans we already have, I am either going to have to miss a university event that I really want to attend in order to see it, or go to London the day before and miss the guard but make the other event.  Neither my mom or I have ever seen the guard change (I have visited London before, however).. How worth is it to see?  I am thinking it's a very popular event and may be difficult to see with all the other tourists anyway.

I'm trying to rent an appartement from a woman located in London and some things about it are very unorthodox for me, so I thought maybe that's just how you rent  appartements in the UK. Some of the things she told me:

- She wants to rent the place for ""at least"" two months. Usually renting such a place here in Germany is unlimited.

- She just wants a 30 days notice before we move out. Here it's 90 days.

- She wants a security deposit and the first rent deposited at a realtor before sending us the keys for our first visit. I mean, I get that she's in the UK and can't just come over to show us the place but asking for such a large amount of money before we have had any chance to see the place seems very strange to us. Even with her assuring us we'd get it back if we don't want to rent it.

If it wouldn't be such a promising appartement I'd just declined long ago because it's too strange for me.",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,self,German about to rent an appartement in Germany from someone in London.

   This issue has always been of the utmost importance to us and, whilst we fully recognise that Spurs fans use of the Y word and associated identity may have caused some upset to members of the Jewish community, we sincerely believe that no Spurs fan uses the term in a malicious way.
  
  As stated at the meeting with The FA at Soho Square in 2006, THST believes that rather than focus on Tottenham Hotspur fans using the term, more work needs to be done to educate supporters of other clubs as to why it is completely unacceptable for them to continue to sing songs and chants that do not focus solely on Spurs fans but slur the Jewish community as a whole. THST recommended a programme be developed to educate fans of opposing teams as to why the meaning when used by others differed to the meaning when used by Spurs fans. It's with much sadness we report that no such programme took place, in spite of our offers of assistance. 

  
   THST is categorically against ejections and banning orders for the use of the term by Tottenham Hotspur supporters in a match environment and will be seeking advice from both the FSF and the legal profession as to whether there is scope for such measures under current legislation. Our view has always been that should Spurs fans use of the âYidâ identity come to an end, this should be as a result of the feeling amongst the Spurs community that it was time to naturally move on.
  
  Over the coming weeks and months, we will continue to communicate with Tottenham Hotspur Football Club and The FA to best serve Tottenham Hotspur supporters on this matter.
We welcome all contribution of ideas towards that aim either by email to info@THSTOfficial.com, via our website located at www.THSTOfficial.com or through our twitter account [@THSTOfficial] (https://twitter.com/THSTOfficial).

I know there is no chance I'd ever get caught...but there is always the 'if'. I don't wanna ride about in fear that I'll lose my license and by bike every time I see a police car. There is no way I'm taking the restrictor out, no matter how much I really want to and how many of you would. I'm not risking it.

So, I'm wondering if you guys think I'd have any chance at all of getting it over-turned/removed...and how I'd go about it.

My argument:
The restriction is based on time. It is a 2 year restriction, not based on mileage, age or experience.
So, in theory you could pass your test, and drive a car for 2 years. Then just jump on an un-restricted bike with no experience.

Therefore the restrictor is pointless. I've rode for almost 2 years. Not a single crash, only been pulled over once. Never had any points, speeding tickets, ANYTHING. I've rode 14,400 miles since passing my test in December. Don't I deserve to have it removed?

If I passed IAM, would I have any more of a chance? Maybe any IAM guys would be willing to stand by me if I could demonstrate my safe riding?

I'm not the best rider in the world. Far from it. I'm nowhere near the fastest rider in the world...but I am safe, and it pisses me off to know I can't have all of my bike even though I have more experience than a lot of people who just jump on an R1 and bin it.

Also - I've noticed a significant drop in the performance of my engine. 10,000 miles since March with a restrictor and I 100% think it has damaged my engine (after all you're only using 1/3rd of it...) it just isn't designed to be ran that way. Any mechanics have a say in this?

So yeah - is it worth seeking legal advice or something because I think it is something which needs attention. The restriction is 100% pointless. **Especially when I've already spend 1 year on a 125cc bike**.",false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,null,null,default,Having a restrictor over-turned?,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/MotoUK/comments/1m8q5r/having_a_restrictor_overturned/

Many people in an area where i (used) to live have recently been publicly voicing their dissatisfaction (via facebook) about their local doctors surgery (not via it's facebook page, but on their own facebook walls)

Recently a person who made such a post (and those commenting on it with a similar feeling) have received letters from the doctors surgery stating that they don't appreciate people ""slandering"" them on a public forum and that they should stop.

It appears they have found the people's addresses by taking their name and cross referencing it with the records they hold. It appears they found out about the negative comments via someone tagging a person in the conversation who was friends with someone who worked at the surgery.

So I ask - Is this a misuse of the records they hold? I have called up the Information Commissioners Office and they suggest this may be the case. I'd like to take this further but i personally didn't receive a letter (and am no longer registered with the surgery), I can't track down an original letter and I don't know the people involved particularly well.

I wonder if anyone could give some insight on this. If it's not a data protection issue, surely it's in the public interest that a company (working in the public interest) is responding to genuine criticism in this way..?

So, over the past summer when we were eagerly awaiting the announcement of Matt Smith's successor and who will be 12, I remember seeing quite a bit of debate/speculation/what have you with regards to who the true regeneration count.

Since the introduction of John Hurt [Spoiler Description](#s ""the idea of being the Doctor between 8 (Mcgann) and 9 (Eccleston) that came during the Time war"") and what his character did [Spoiler Description](#s ""Not acting in the name 'Doctor' but acting to preserve peace and sanity..."")

A handful of folks around the web have thrown out the idea that with the revelation of Hurt, a few individuals have retroactively considered 9 to be 10, 10 to be 11, and so on...

I have considered this possibility, and have thought more on it since I've seen ideas of the regeneration limit lifted during the war.  What if all Time Lords were forced into a wartime regeneration to serve as better soldiers/defenders? It's not unthinkable that regenerations couldn't be forced since that's how the transition between 2 and 3 went.

The leak from the private rented property came through the plastered over cracks in my friends ceiling, and cracked the plaster. This went on for hours until the private tenant came home. The ceiling in my friends flat is now cracked, and stained with a rust color.

How does my friend get the bathroom back to where it was. BTW they have no household insurance. Do they fix it and bill the landlord of the above property? What can they do to redress the situation?",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,self,Question about compensation on damage to home,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1m8yfb/question_about_compensation_on_damage_to_home/

I'm good with computers and can do the PC building no probs (the only difficult part is ventilation, I don't want to use water cooling), but I can't even light a match without burning myself.  Anyone who is interested or knows of someone who might be, please let us know and I'll go into more detail.  The emphasis in this would be on beautiful, functional furniture.

We've recently been working on a startup in Wales. We are making a listings website which offers people the chance to freely list any items of choice online. The user then has the chance to boost there advertisement to the front page and pay a small fee to do so. 

We are based in Wales and are primarily looking to be a Welsh marketplace online and have decided we would like to commit 5% of any profits to charity however, we are yet to decide on a charity and your input would be great. Obviously choosing between charities is difficult but we are looking to support a Welsh charity, keeping it all local.

We are also yet to turn any profit as we need users to make the website successful so at the moment everything is kind of slow but we are committed as soon as we start to gain traction, to donate 5%.

The website is here - http://www.Boosterads.co.uk

* **Choosing where to go:**

[Here](http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/nsa/National%20Scenic%20Areas.pdf) is a map of the National Scenic Areas of Scotland. Other places are nice too.

[Here](http://www.geograph.org.uk/map/tolJ5oOXXJ0oNJFoOXXJfolXbJqobXXJL5405obZtMawOVXh4bVuuM) is a link to Geograph.org. This site has photos of nearly every inch of the land laid over the OS map. You have to zoom in twice on the red map and then click ""Draggable OS"". Perfect for finding hidden, remote camping spots and seeing what the access and area is like.

[Here](http://wtp2.appspot.com/wheresthepath.htm) is WheresThePath which features a split screen with Googlemaps on one side and OS on the other, as well as 1930s maps and others. Zoomable and draggable. The license on the OS maps has a daily limit. Very handy for advance navigation and printing your own maps and altitude graphs.

* **How to get there:**

[Buses](http://www.citylink.co.uk/routes.php) travel between Scotlands main towns (Esp. Glasgow, Edinburgh, Inverness, Perth, Oban and Skye) They are generally frequent and relatively cheap. You cannot take bikes.

[Trains](http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/files/images/Rail/scotlarge.gif) allow access to a large part of the country. Bikes need to be booked on when you purchase. Prices can be cheaper when bought in advance. With 4 people for a weekend it could be cheaper to hire a car.

[Ferries](http://www.projectmapping.co.uk/Reviews/Resources/Calmac%20map.gif) do exist, and provide for pedestrians, cars and bikes to all the main Islands. Island hopping 8 or 15 day [passes](http://www.calmac.co.uk/tickets/island-hopping/) can bring the price down.

[Royal Mail Postbuses](http://www.royalmail.com/personal/uk-delivery/postbus) have a limited number of routes (8 in Scotland) but can be hailed anywhere on the road, of note are the Western Isles services.

[StageCoachBuses](http://www.stagecoachbus.com/highlands-routemaps.aspx) have many routes around the highlands.

* **What to do:**

[Multiday walks](http://www.snh.gov.uk/enjoying-the-outdoors/where-to-go/routes-to-explore/scotlands-great-trails/)

[Short walks and hills](http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/)

[Your Access Rights and Responsibilities](http://www.outdooraccess-scotland.com/outdoors-responsibly/your-access-rights/), know before you go.

* Survival

Most streams and rivers in Scotland are clean and delicious off the beaten track but do check for dead things or houses or other campers upstream.

It is most common to use a gas burner to heat your meals as much of Scotland lacks trees and fires in wooded areas are not allowed per the SOAC. This does not apply on beaches.

In fact, I knew very soon after I met him that he was unique â someone whose personality, ambition, and ability to instill belief in others made him inspirational. People mock him for claiming to be âspecialâ â I would advise against it. Look at what he has achieved already in his relatively short career in football. 

I saw his introduction as Chelsea manager on television the same as everyone else. Myself, JT, Bridgey and Joe Cole were holed up in the England team hotel in Manchester preparing for Euro 2004 when Mourinho exploded into our lives. I watched his performance in the press conference at Stamford Bridge and thought he came across as arrogant and very confident but I donât have a problem with that when someone has the medals in their locker to back it up. 

It wasnât his Champions League, UEFA Cup and Portuguese title wins which swayed me though. Once I met him I knew he was the real thing. I had two conversations with him that summer of 2004 which convinced me that I was dealing with a man who knew what he wanted and knew how to achieve it. 

The unshakeable self-belief which is his trademark can have a very powerful effect on those he believes are of a similar mind. He can be intimidating but he also has a charm which is just as disarming. I began to understand him when we were in America on a pre-season tour that July. Training was varied and enjoyable and his likeable character made the lads comfortable. Nevertheless, I wasnât prepared for what happened after practice.

I was last in the shower and turning to leave when I was stopped in my tracks by the manager. There was a moment of silence as I waited for him to move but he looked me in the eye and I realized he had something to say.

âAll right, boss?â I asked, wondering what I had done to invite an audience. 

âYou are the best player in the world,â he said without blinking. I was slightly confused as well as completely naked. Talk about feeling vulnerable. 

âYou,â he said more forcefully, â are the best player in the world.â 

âOh. Thanks, boss,â I replied cautiously. 

I was unsure if he was telling me this to boost my confidence. I knew that I wasnât the best player in the world and the only indication I had that he rated me was second hand or from the complimentary way he spoke to me in training sessions. He sensed a misunderstanding and made himself very clear.

âListen. A year ago Deco was a fantastic player but now he is in line to win the European Footballer of the Year. Why do you think that is? I will tell you. A year ago he was the same player but now he has won the Champions League and the Portuguese title with Porto and heâs proved he is one of the best. 

âYou are just as good as Zidane, Vieira or Deco and now all you have to do is win things. You are the best player in the world but now you need to prove it and win trophies. You understand?â 

âOkay boss.â 

I knew what he meant but I also felt a bit embarrassed. I wanted to get out of the shower and out of the conversation as quickly as I could. He had elevated me to a new level and I felt a massive surge in confidence. I was walking on air for the rest of that day and I called Mum to tell her what Mourinho had said. 

âYes,â she replied nonchalantly, âI already knew you were the best in the world.â 

I felt ten feet tall and trained harder than ever over the next couple of days. Everything I tried came off â passes, shots, even a couple of headers! We played Celtic in Seattle on the Saturday in our first game under the new boss. The city was experiencing its hottest summer for eighty-three years and it was more than 100Â°F when I jogged out as a second-half sub. Thatâs all right, no problem to the best player in the world â except that I had an absolute stinker. I mis-hit passes, mistimed tackles, and felt sluggish. I came off the pitch feeling a right mug. I couldnât face the manager. How could I? He had told me I was the best player in the world and I had just played forty-five minutes looking more Sunday league than Champions League. He didnât say a word â well, not until a whole year later when we were in New York the following pre-season. He came up to me during training. 

âLamps. Remember that game against Celtic in Seattle last summer?â he asked. 

âYeah. I was complete s*** wasnât I?â 

âYes, you were. You couldnât even pass three yards.â 

We laughed and he put his hand on my shoulder. Togetherness and team spirit came easily and in abundance under Mourinho. If I had a pound for every time someone has asked me for the secret of his success then maybe I would have enough money to pay him to tell me. All I can say is that he has an intuitive understanding of the way people work, of their dreams and desires, and how to harness that energy and convert it into a winning formula. There is no one big thing he has done, no Mourinho magic which turns everything to gold; instead itâs the little things that count â things like instigating a huddle in the changing room before we take the field for a game. JT came up to me the afternoon of that first match with Celtic and told me the plan. 

âThe gaffer said he wants me to get everyone round and I have to give a speech before the match,â John said. 

âWhat am I going to say geezer?â 

âI dunno,â I replied unhelpfully. 

âIâm not sure I like the sound of that. Itâs embarrassing. Thank fuck youâre up first.â 

âYeah, but youâll be next so we better work it out geez.â 

âBut itâs only Celtic and pre-season. It doesnât matter. Weâre all just trying to get fit today.â 

âThat donât matter mate. Iâm telling ya, he wants it to start today.â 

All we could be sure about was that the âspeechâ should conclude with the question âWho are we?â and the shouted response âChelsea!â It still felt very strange when the time came to get into the huddle. JT was great. He set the tone with a real rant about winning, mixed with a lot of effing and blinding. My contributions have been a bit less boisterous but between us all we made it work in our favour and it was the beginning of a very special camaraderie which has got stronger. 

Within a few weeks of entering our lives Mourinho had taken us from being a talented group with the potential to win major honours to a team which would settle for nothing less. I wasnât surprised. From the moment I saw him handle the media on his first day at Chelsea I knew that there was something which set him apart from everyone else. 

That opinion was clearly not shared by the non-Chelsea lads at the England team hotel. I headed for the dining room and Mourinhoâs appearance on telly was the talk of the tables. His swaggering style had certainly made an impression and I learned immediately that I had a manager who grabbed peopleâs attention. 

âSee your new gaffer on the telly?â I was asked a few times by some of the players. It was then followed by: âWho the f*** does he think he is?â 

I wasnât affected by this response. I understood their reaction â it was, after all, the same as that of the general public â but Iâm drawn to individuals who have real character and I didnât feel threatened. My only concern at that stage was what he thought about me. Before Mourinhoâs appointment Didier Deschamps had been in the frame to succeed Ranieri and had been very complimentary about me which selfishly made me wonder if he might be the best candidate. By contrast, there had been only silence from Mourinho. 

I had been preparing myself for his arrival though. A friend in the press called me a couple of days earlier and told me it was definitely him. Fine. He was articulate and well presented and, of course, he had just won the European Cup. Now I just had to wait to talk to him. The wait was short: Eriksson came to me after the meal and said that the new Chelsea manager was on his way to Manchester and wanted to meet me. âNot you then, Sven,â I thought fleetingly. 

JT, Coley, Bridgey, and I were shown to a room in the hotel and waited. We were all nervous. We had seen a stranger describe himself as the âspecial oneâ and he was our new boss. What was I supposed to say to him? I had heard that he was very methodical and would call a team meeting to discuss the finest detail of planning for a match. My experience of that style of management before was with the England Under-21s when Howard Wilkinson was in charge. Wilkinson would call meetings about meetings about meetings â it was very boring and ultimately pointless. Being tactical and organized is something I believe is very important but there has to be balance. 

The door opened and in came Peter Kenyon, Roman Abramovich, Eugene Tenenbaum and then Mourinho. I thought he would be very serious but he smiled and shook hands with us in a very friendly and informal way, putting us at ease. I noticed a twinkle in his eye which suggested he was excited about the adventure he had just signed up for. Kenyon spoke first, introducing Mourinho and saying a few words about how the club was going to go forward. I hardly heard him. His speech barely registered with me â my focus was on Mourinho who sat back in his chair looking extremely comfortable. I was on the edge of mine, literally. 

âItâs a pleasure to be here,â Mourinho began. âI wanted to come and meet you because you are the English heart of Chelsea and a very important part of the team and I want you to be even more so for my team. 

âThis will be a very exciting time for all of us. We will bring in some new players but I wanted to come here to tell you myself that all of you will be major players next season. I have seen what you have done so far and think you are capable of more. With me as coach we will achieve that together.â 

He then spoke to Coley directly. The rest of us were all established but Joe had been in and out of the team and had had a difficult first year at the club. I look back now and realize how perceptive Mourinho was â he realized that Coley was the one of the four who needed most encouragement. 

âI know how I want to play you and how I can get the best out of you,â he said. âI have good experience of making a skilful player work for the team. I did it at Porto and Iâm sure we can do this together at Chelsea.â We chatted for a few minutes and then Mourniho signalled that it was time to go. He had, however, one final point to make. 

âI need to know that you are winners.â

It was a rhetorical question but the brief silence was followed by a nodding of heads and âYes bossâ all round. 

âGood. Because I am a winner and now so are you. We will win things together.â And with that he stood up, shook us by the hand, and walked out of the room. 

Eugene and Roman smiled proudly. They knew they had the right man for the job â and so did we. I didnât see him again until after the European Championships though I know he came to watch all of Englandâs games. I was relieved when he gave an interview during that period saying that he wanted to build the midfield around me. There had been a lot of chat about Portoâs Portuguese players Costinha and Deco arriving at Chelsea, so this reassurance was welcome. 

Harlington was a different place when I returned from holiday after Euro 2004. Mourinho had asked for huge nets to be installed behind the goals and we had ball boys around the practice pitch â previously I would have run to collect a ball myself â simple things but very effective. There was a rule book which he had distributed but he was careful to point out that the one rule he expected us all to adhere to more than any other was to behave as a professional footballer should. 

John and I had been appointed as captain and vice-captain of the club while we were in the States and it became clear that I would have more interaction with Mourinho than I had been used to with any previous manager. Ranieri was never one to consult the players very much, but soon JT and I were being asked our opinion on possible transfer targets as well as the details of the training structure. 

Before he signed a new centre-back he called us to see him and explained that he had identified four possible players: one was English, one Italian, a South American, and Ricardo Carvalho. John and I knew Carvalho from the European Championships and reckoned he was very good but Mourinho was tentative about bringing in too many Portuguese. We told him he should just buy the best.

His response? 4 weeks of pills instead. Ho hum.

So I told him I wasn't up for that at all, and felt that having somebody with whom to communicate what's ticking to would be much more beneficial, so I got no pills and a referral instead! Success!

We are a small software engineering company based in London. We are looking for a Rails contractor as an addition to our team.

We work on several different systems for a range of Startups at any given time. This means that the tasks the developers encounter are varied and range from system architecture and requirements engineering to development, testing and deploying production systems.

The team works remotely and meets via video chat every day. You have the freedom to manage your time yourself, we don't mind when you work as long as the work gets done. You will regularly meet others from the team and the project managers face-to-face in London, depending on where you are based. We are all developers so no frustration with non-technical managers. bitsilk has flat hierarchies, we just get together as a team, discuss and find a solution.

You will lead development on complete projects together with a project manager who deals with the customer and manages the requirements.

We are looking for someone who feels comfortable deciding core implementation questions autonomously.
Overall it is a very flexible and varied position that will put you in front of a range of technologies together with a great team.

**Skills &amp; Requirements**

What you should have:

*   Experience with Ruby on Rails
*     Deep knowlege of JavaScript, haml and scss
*     Understanding of BDD with cucumber
*     Experience in using PostgreSQL and MongoDB
*     Deep understanding of coding standards and best practices
*     Experience with git
*     Passion for elegant, well written code
*     Passion for learning new technologies fast

Bonus skills:

*     Experience with NodeJS
*     Experience in building mountable engines in Rails
*     Understanding of multi-stage deployment with capistrano
*     Any knowledge or experience in AI (ANN, Evolutionary Computing, Agent-based systems)

**About bitsilk**

bitsilk was founded by two developers in '08. Over the past years we developed our buiness model, market niche and identity.
We focus on startups and our mission is to provide a complete service from idea to launch and then on to continuous iteration.

Developers know under which circumstances they can do their job best - for ourselves and for the project. That is how bitsilk operates.

bitsilk is flexible and a great place to work (if we may say so ourselves) but we have big ambitions and a vision to take it much further. Since we have flat hierarchies and short ways everyone can have an impact on how the company operates and in which direction we go.

Besides working on client projects we get together to work on fun side projects from time to time. Currently we are building a strategy game using WebGL and NodeJS websockets whenever there is time.

We meet up regularly - virtually and offline - for a beer or a dinner and are planning a retreat in Denmark this winter.

Check out [bitsilk.com](http://bitsilk.com) for more information.

**Salary**
around Â£300/day, depending on experience

**How to apply**

We will have virtually no power to oppose legislation voted for by people in far-away countries such as Greece or Hungary (who have rapidly growing Fascist movements).

The 50th was originally announced to be 90 minutes long.  While that's sort of okay, I didn't like it very much.  But now, according to another article, the 50th is going to be 75 minutes long, and that REALLY bugs me.

Why, you may ask?  Well think about this.  Classic Doctor Who episodes, while having a different format, were all (for the most part) longer than 75 minutes.  Every time the Doctor met himself, it was even longer (for example, The Two Doctors was a 3 part episode with each being about 45 minutes).  Now back to modern Who.  Most specials are in fact under 75 minutes, but in my opinion this is no ordinary special.  This is the 50th anniversary for crying out loud!  This is supposed to celebrate 50 YEARS of time and space, and yet it's shorter that your average 2 part episode!  In my opinion, the 50th special should have been like The End of Time special.  Not necessarily being split into two parts, but the fact that it was at least 2 hours.  Honestly, even though that special was amazing, it didn't deserve to be that long the way the 50th does.

He scored 3 times and made 4 assists in 6 international games.
It's been reported from a belgian football show that he is living really badly the situation with Chelsea right now.  He was seen upset at the belgian training for their game against Scotland.

It's well known that De Bruyne could have been loaned at Dortmund but the deal didn't go through at the fault of Mourinho. Playing at Dortmund would have promised him a starter position with a great trainer. 
The kid did a superb campaign with Chelsea in Asia and USA, he was elected man of the match for Chelsea's first season match.  Then suddenly he isn't playing for the Supercup, being favored by Schurrle and he is not even benched.
Then at the last minute of the mercato, Willian is being bought for 35 millions and speaks portuguese. So i'm thinking, what the hell is Mourinho doing?  Moreover De Bruyne hasn't seen this coming at all and must feel trapped.

De Bruyne has always been essential for his past teams, being RC GENK or Werder Bremen.  He's known as being proud and always willing to feel important for his team.  Now i know being on the bench for 2/3 months shouldn't be a big deal as he can force 
a loan during the january period.  Now, what about you guys how do you feel about all this KDB story?  Sorry for my english ;)",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,About KDB,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1mbinr/about_kdb/

**Welcome to the pre-match thread for this English Premier League game. It is a game from matchweek 4 of the 2013/14 season.**

*The international break is over, and Chelsea will hope to continue their unbeaten start to the season away to Everton. Everton will hope the same, though their 3 points tally from 3 draws doesn't compare to Chelsea's 7. Chelsea were the only team to beat Everton at Goodison last year.*

I get a phone call from a window cleaner. The window cleaner has my number as in May he knocked at the door asking if I require his services. I said I'd think about it. I took his card. He asked for my number and he'd let me know when was around and we could tell him if we wanted our windows cleaned. I never did contact him again. I got two text messages through the months in which I didn't reply. 

One morning I had an appointment at the hospital so I hadn't left the house early for work as usual. I'd been a little later to go to my appointment when I caught a fella cleaning the windows. ""I never asked for you to clean them. Why are you?"" He was just doing as he was told. I said carry on but only this once and I'd pay him there and then. But he said no. We'll collect later in the day. I never heard from them again. 

So he calls me aggressively on the phone. Not letting me get a word in edge wats. This guy wants Â£18 now off me and I've moved house since. He is threatening legal action in the small courts and CCJ. 

Now I'd gladly see him in court. No contract was ever verbally made. He took not replying to his text messages as proof we wanted them cleaned and said the judge would see as such. I'm not too sure on the fact. 

But for Â£18 is it worth the stress of not paying on principle or worrying that my new address will be passed to him and see him turning up at my door and putting in the windows? Or worth the stress the judge doesn't rule in my favour. Annoyed to the eye balls now.

To say much more would be to spoil the central conceit, so what I will say is this; the first episode is not the greatest in the world, but the second episode more than makes up for it. By the end of that episode, you'll know whether or not this is for you. If you are interested in watching this at all though, I strongly recommend that you do not read or watch anything about this, as it will most likely give away the neat thing about it. Best go in without any prior knowledge. The same goes for future episodes, so ignore the trailers at the end.

The first two episodes will be on BBC 3 next Friday and then repeated on the Saturday evening after.

Something which I've generally heard when people talk about our ancestry is that southerners are Anglo-Saxons, northerners are Vikings and the Scottish, Welsh and Irish are Celts. I thought it might interest those of you whose ancestors are from these Isles to read the following. I've heard about Oppenheimer's work before and have been meaning to get his book about the British. The comment [is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16zl9b/are_modern_greeks_egyptians_etc_mostly_descended/c815mh5), and the following is the summary:

**In summary, Oppenheimer states:
The most important message of my genetic story is that three quarters of British ancestors arrived long before the first farmers. This applies in varying proportions to 88% of Irish, 81% of Welsh, 79% of Cornish, 70% of the people of Scotland and its associated islands and 68% (over two thirds) of the English and their politically associated islands. These figures dwarf any perception of Celtic or Anglo-Saxon ethnicity based on concepts of more recent, massive invasions ... There is certainly a deep genetic division between peoples of the west and east coasts of the British Isles, particularly between the English and the Welsh, but this does not merely reflect the Anglo-Saxon, Viking and Norman invasions. These were only the most recent of a succession of waves of cultural and genetic influx from north-west Europe, going back to the first farmers and before.**

All of my traceable ancestry bar a blob of Italian is English, Scottish and Irish, and I rather like the idea that I my ancestors have been here since the resettlement after the last ice age.

Speaking of which, the fucker has disappeared off the radar for the last two months. I should probably text him really. It's sad when your closest friends move away huh?

I've just been invited to a gig in Notts the weekend before TRL pub meet in Manchester. I really want to go. But: money. Can someone please motivate me to get a better, well paid job? It's not as though I can't do it, it's just the whole effort problem again.

I have also seen every episode of the new series. This is more of an discussion post regarding the matter.

Back 7-8 years ago I watched the first couple seasons of Doctor Who with my dad. At the time I hated it, but I'll get back to that later. 

I saw an episode listed the night before the mid season premier and decided to give Doctor Who a chance again.  I decided to start from season 7 and watched all of them as they were released.Matt Smith was awesome in the episode, and Clara Oswin Oswald made me fall back in love with the show. So after reading up and seeing Clara Oswin Oswald was the new companion. 

I decided to start back at the begging on Season 1. Honestly it was torture trying to get through that season. I wasn't a fan of the first doctor, and I could barely watch Rose Tyler without wanting to turn it off. That combined with the horrible special effects and poorly made costumes IMO made the season a massive bust. David Tennent carried Season 2 and 3 but they still lacked a decent companion. Season 4 was the first really good season in my opinions, but all the constant drawback to the previous 2 companions didn't do much for the season. 

But then Season 5 starts. You lose all recurring main/secondary characters then you get a new doctor and a brand new companion. It seemed like season 5 was designed as a start fresh for the show. Barely anything from the previous 4 seasons came back. I really enjoyed season 5-7 Amelia Pond and Clara Oswin Oswald did wonders as companions. 

----

So back to the question if you were to get someone who has no idea what Doctor Who is, where would you recommend they start. The goal is to make them die hard fans of the show. 

----

Based on the fresh start of Season 5 - I say start at Season 5 - You don't have to worry about any background info from previous seasons holding back your experience, everything after that is basically brand new or explained for first time viewers. After season 5 I think the show is top notch. The only flaws I can really think of would be in the occasional episode plot. I think if people started at Season 1 they would have a harder time pushing through. Once they finish 5-7 sure go back and watch 1-4!

I realize my view may be controversial and fairly unpopular here, but that's why this is a discussion post. So we can get multiple views and opinions on the matter!

Next Friday, my wife and I need to attend a funeral in Bootle/Liverpool, as we live 4.5 hours away, we're looking for a spare room for Thurs 19th and Friday 20th night for a young professional couple and two dogs. I run a small web design business and my wife is a deputy care manager at an elderly care home. We don't smoke, we do drink socially but don't go clubbing or stay out at ridiculous hours. We do however have two dogs. Both well behaved, a Yorkie and a Collie Cross. We have no criminal records, clean driving license. We are happy to discuss provisos, give identification, whatever it takes.

We're checking all the usual places so don't worry about sharing links, but as a Redditor I thought it might be fun to see if there are others with room in their homes and their heart.

We need:

* A floor, it doesn't even need a bed as we have our own inflatable mattress and sleeping bags.
* Space for two well behaved dogs for a couple of hours Friday (the rest of the time they will remain with us)
* Dogs are affectionate and lovely, however one isn't keen on toddlers. Young controllable children ok, but all-hands-jump-on-dog-toddlers are not worth the risk. Existing 4 legged pets may also be a problem so thanks, but don't worry.

In return, we can offer:

* Some financial reimbursement (although funds are limited)
* And/or help with housework and/or garden for the time we have available
* And/or home cooked lunch and dinner (we have a number of cuisines in our repertoire)
* Help with PC repair/streamlining
* Help with a website for your small business/hobby
* Conversation about painting, TV, PCs, Gaming
* Challenging game(s) of Scrabble
* Cleanliness; We would leave your home in the same way or better than when we arrived.

So, I ask you, which Doctor(s) should I watch?",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Which Doctor should I start watching?,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1mdi2m/which_doctor_should_i_start_watching/

1' Shot from Sigurdsson goes over the goal  
3' Townsend takes a fantastic shot that goes *just* right of the goal.  
(If I miss something it's because my stream is shit currently, sadly)  
11' Eriksen plays beautifully to get it into the box and shoots but Ruddy knocks it away. Soldado fired a shot but it ends up back with Norwich.  
(I found it on TV, hell yes)  
23' Rose is fouled, FK for us. Taken by Eriksen.  
24' Free Kick comes in and is blocked by a Norwich player. Eriksen fires a shot well over goal.  
25' Corner comes in, comes to nothing until the ball gets in to Soldado but it's blocked well by Basson/Ruddy.  
27' SIGURDSSON NETS IT AFTER A BEAUTIFULLY SET UP CHANCE BY ERIKSEN AND SOLDADO!  
34' van Wolfswinkel gets in but it goes out for a goal kick.  
38' Nice play by Norwich but Vertonghen cuts out a pass and Rose gets it out.  
43' Walker just chilling out and having a walk in the center of the pitch, shows how free we are right now.  
**HALFTIME**  
45' Second Half Commences.  
49' SIGURDSSONNNNNNNNNNNNNNN WITH ANOTHER GOAL AFTER A CROSS FROM PAULINHO!  
68' WHAT A TACKLE FROM ROSE  
73' Holtby on for Eriksen. What a debut from Eriksen, top lad.  
78' Goal Scorer Sigurdsson comes off to a standing ovation, switches with the Beast.  
82' Lamela on for DembÃ©lÃ© after a nice chance for Townsend that goes just over.

**[](//#notes) Match Notes:**

* Will Samuel Etoâo and Willian prove the key signings triggering a Chelsea march to the title, or are they simply passing through Stamford Bridge for their latest pay cheque?
* Everton have Gareth Barry and James McCarthy making their debut, but these are the types of fixtures when the physical presence of Marouane Fellaini will be missed most.
* Chelsea are unbeaten in the Barclays Premier League in 11 games, winning 27 points from the last 33.
* **Milestone:** If selected, Cesar Azpilicueta will make his 50th Chelsea appearance.

**DAYS SINCE**

* Chelsea lost an away game in the Premier League: 168
* Everton lost at home in the Premier League: 258
* Arsenal won a trophy: 3,038

My partner and I have 2 rooms available to rent on Wallisdown Road in Bournemouth, we are looking for a nice couple interested in house sharing!

I hope it's okay to advertise this here, we are going to be living here for at least 2 more years so we are really looking for committed long-term residents.

We're friendly gaming nerds, currently working and studying in science and technology fields so we'd love a like-minded couple to share with, but people from all walks of life are welcome!

Now, I live with my mother. My father moved out in 1997. Currently her partner lives with us.
Is his income included in ""parents'"" income? He's not a parent or guardian; I'm 22 and he's just another adult who I live with.

I ask because if he's not included, and the Student Finance Gods only go by my mother's income, I could get a bursary. But, if he *is* included, their collected income is above the threshold and I don't get a penny.

I live in London and am not a spring chick, so perhaps my list is a bit disproportionate. 

Saw my mum's friend get beaten up by a mugger when I was nine. They didn't give a crap that there were two children present. They went for her because she said 'that bastard has stolen my chain' whilst my mum didn't say anything about hers. Charming.

Then of course there was the gun-wielding drugged up neighbour I had to get out of my flat. I'll try to find a link. 

When I was 18 I was walking to work along Oxford Street and smoking, and a perfectly pleasant looking man in his early 20s said 'I hope you die of cancer' as he walked past me.

Then there was the man on a train around Christmas time who called me a 'fucking little cunt' because I turned down his drunken request for me to go to his Christmas party with him. 

Oh, I was groped while sleeping on the train once too. First thing in the morning and I was travelling in from Kent and was asleep. Woke to find my trousers had been unzipped and there was a hand in them. He'd sat down with a box in a bin bag on his lap so that it would cover what he was doing. I shouted something obscene at him and people on the train looked at me like I was a mad woman, ha. 

I've had people spit in my face three times:

1) a complete stranger got off the bus at the entrance doors in Brixton and spat in my face as he did so (I don't like Brixton much, crazies chase after me wanting money/cigarettes/who knows what)

2) my husband pinned me down when we were having a row and spat in my face; I had to headbutt him really hard to get him off me (yes, that was the beginning of the end, and yes, it did work)

3) a few years ago someone on the night bus objected to me asking him to turn down his music and spat in my face as he got off at his stop. Now, having already had my face spat in twice in my life, I now had a low tolerance threshold for face spit. This was unwise as I was on my own and he was not, but I ran after him, and the bus driver opened the doors so that I could get to him. I punched him in the face twice, the driver closed the door and we toddled off home. Would sober me have done the same thing? Honestly? Probably. Spitting in someone's face is up there on the grossest things ever to do to someone list. I was coming back from... you guessed, Brixton.

I think I've had my purse stolen twice and a handbag once. The handbag really pissed me off because I loved that handbag, and it had a few hundred quid's worth of makeup in it. I was in a group of 10 people in the pub after we'd won the pub quiz and stupidly thought it would be safe while I went to the loo, as I tucked it underneath someone. Apparently some guy stumbled through the group pretending to be drunk and lifted it with nobody noticing. It goes with me everywhere these days. 

Umm, I think that's it for now anyway. I haven't had a fight since I was 11 though, well except for with the ex but I don't think he really counts. 

Oh, I nearly forgot. Again, 18, walking back to my flat with the bf from a club at about 3am, we'd had an argument so I was a few hundred meters ahead of him stropping, a group of three or four men caught up with me and tried to talk me into going back with them or something. I said no, pointed to my bf a bit further down the hill, they objected to me being with a 'black cunt' and started on me. He obviously ran up the hill but I don't think they did that much damage to him. Me however, well I ended up in the gutter in the middle of the road whilst they kicked ten tons of shit out of me. We went straight to A and E, iirc to get his wounds checked out, there might've been blood, I can't quite remember. Anyway, I woke up the next day and couldn't walk. It took the ambulance men 30 minutes to get me into the wheelchair to get me x-rayed at the hospital because the pain was so tremendous. Miraculously, nothing was broken. But I couldn't walk for a fortnight. They caught them btw, and there were eyewitnesses. But as nothing was broken and they were all first time offenders, they got off with warnings. I did get a call from the police asking if I thought it was a racially motivated attack.... well fucking durr.

Edit: been away, so only just got the chance to add some of the fantastic suggestions I've had. A couple of things for posterities sake: being the worst player to player for Liverpool whose surname ends in a particular letter doesn't necessarily mean they were crap. We could sign a 'Q' who broke Dixie Dean's goalscoring record but he'd still be the worst 'Q' in LFC history by virtue of being the *only* 'Q'. Secondly, if there were was more than one name in the frame for a slot, I made a choice entirely based on my own prejudice.

I am curious. I just moved into my new place and am looking to add that COYS touch.

I am looking for something about 5 ft wide and 6 ft tall, or bigger. Any Ideas with wear to acquire such a thing at a decent price?

Guidelines

Think mid sized x-mas present so not overtly pricey
Cost effective shipping to Toronto Canada
Preferably more weight and fuller feel than a simple flag hanging loosely on the wall

Ideally with club emblem and name

- Any hotel one would recommend (nothing ultra cheap or excessively fancy) ?

Unfortunately insurance is already looking very pricey (Â£1500+) despite the bike only being worth Â£3k.

My experience: Bachelors of Science Degree in Packaging and 1.5 years of industry experience. Studied in the UK before and have been trying to get back there ever since. 

About me: Providing consumers with both a life brand and a cohort brand can often be a challenging prospect. Creating a prominent presence for the younger market while maintaining customer loyalty throughout generations requires innovation from the packaging department. I would love the opportunity to participate in the packaging development process from concept development, all the way to execution and launch. With my R &amp; D experience, I hope to bring with me new ideas, problem solving skills, and product initiatives. Cross collaborative efforts are crucial in a consumer produced goods company and as a packaging engineer, constant interaction with professionals of different departments and sometimes, different companies, is common. My time at Mars Inc. allowed me to get exposure to other functions of the company throughout my projects. The prospects for growth, innovation, and success are vast and endless.  With my technical experience in various laboratories and energy plants, I hope to provide technical support as well as troubleshooting production problems.
I look forward to hearing back from you and please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

I've always enjoyed watching EPL but never really had a team.  I just got NBC sports so I get to watch live games/recaps on sat/sun.  I'm a faithful follower of all of ""my"" teams (NFL MLB etc) so this hasn't been a light decision. I decided to follow closely for a couple weeks and just wait for a team to come to me, and Tottenham has done it.  Play style? Jerseys? Fans? Maybe just coincidence?  Who cares, I'm all in and will be following as closely as i possibly can on this side of the pond.

With the turning circle of a London bus, Zamora hasn't been at his best. SWP is winning more in the air than Bobby and in general Zamora looks disinterested. 

From the outset his acquisition puzzled me. As a QPR player I'll cheer him on, but based on his recent performance and apparent lack of effort, I'm not sure he should be in the first team. It was apparent how much better we played without him on the pitch; with Bobby playing it looks like we have just 10 men.

The surprise at the team sheet and the expected 2 up-front formation was audible at the Crown and Sceptre before the game yesterday. Many have been saying we should be able to play 1 up front and 5 in mid-field, particularly with the 12 mid-field players we have on our books.

To save a wall of text I'll bullet point. (It turned into a bit of a wall, sorry.)

- Had a few friends in school/college but haven't for the better part of 8 years now. 

- Live in the country, middle of nowhere, very little happening here.

- Low paying job, not much money, can't afford a car to go elsewhere.

- Gone quite awkward from being a recluse, not sure what to do about it.

- Colleagues are mostly elderly, I'm 25.

- Tried a few evening classes to make friends, each time didn't go well (socially). Mostly nippers there anyway.

- Looked up local clubs, slim pickings. Tried the local walking club, went quite badly, very unfriendly lot. Very few other clubs, none I can afford/have any interest in (Morris dancing, for example).

- Have a few hobbies/interests but they're all solitary by necessity. Looked into cultivating more social interests but it's difficult to do that with no money, and there's nothing much like that going on locally anyway.

- Tried getting in touch with old school friends, they're not interested.

Usually just shut up and get on with it, as I should, but I'm getting pretty desperate. I don't think people are meant to be alone all the time and it does my head in a bit sometimes. Could really use some advice, sorry if this isn't the right place to ask but all the things I've tried has been from non UK specific advice, and it hasn't worked.

Sure it's only 4 games in (2 for Osvaldo) but now we've had a good look it's nice to gauge opinion.

I'm very happy with the partnership that Lovren and Fonte seem to have struck up. Conceding only 2 goals in 4 games is very good, and it has been a long time since I've been able to feel comfortable about our defense.

Wanyama looks solid. From what i've seen he appears to work best when he doesn't try anything fancy. He's good at just getting the ball down and moving it on. He gives the ball away quite cheaply at times though.

Osvaldo is still adjusting. I don't think he's on the same wavelength as the rest of the team yet, we caught a glimpse today on some of the skills he has and how creative he can be. But the problem is I don't think the rest of the team are able to expect or anticipate any of the things he does. I imagine it will be a while until that is the case, but it's bound to happen.

1) Are there standards of dress I should be aware of? For example, is turning up to class in a plain white t-shirt and jeans ok, or would I be considered an idiotic American? What about in general (say, hanging out with friends)?

1b) On that note, I somehow just can't imagine Brits wearing Nike sneakers. So, am I wrong on that note, and if not, what do you wear?

2) Never had alcohol before (I'm a law-abiding person, except for maybe jaywalking. Ok, fine, I've jaywalked). That said, I understand alcohol is treated very differently, since it's legal (which is to say, I should expect more alcohol in general to be consumed, but less crazy stuff, like binge-drinking). Yes? No? Any tips on adjusting?

3) As far as packing goes--besides clothes, which is answered by question 1, and electronics, which is going to be a mess anyway--anything I should think of bringing to the UK which I wouldn't be if I were merely going to somewhere in the US?

I'll start off with a preface saying that I absolutely love Rose, and love Martha and Donna even more (Martha since she was purposefully awesome and kickass whereas Rose was accidentally so, and Donna was just hilarious and witty), even though plenty seem to disregard one or all of them as ""bitchy"" or ""stupid"". It seems that the same sort of people are quick to dismiss those who found the Rose x Meta pairing, a comforting end to her story, as ""tumblr fanfic-writing teens deep in their wet dreams and insecurity"". I find this a bit insulting and when I saw one variation of this remark on this subreddit yesterday night, I was actually hurt. 

So, why is this anyway? 

I found it a brilliant and ""safe"" ending where my favorite heroine got to eat her cake too; and I hope that the 50th will not feature the Meta doctor but perhaps simply explore timelines and events that happen to include 10, and yet people also insult us for *apparently* wanting Meta to be part of the special. On top of all this, my favorite doctor isn't even 10, but 9.

I want to say from a a corner, but I can't be too sure.

Somewhere around the 30 minute mark, however, Lucas or Agger will go in hard to prevent a Swensea counter-attack and will earn themselves a yellow which will make them extra cautios the rest of the game until they are subbed out, possibly for Wisdom, in the 74^th minute.

At half time the lads will go into the lockerroom and take whatever sleeping pills they have been taking all year and we'll look dreadful.  Second half will have 50/50 posession at best, but I suspect more along the lines of 60/40 Swansea. We will have a promising counter attack around the 60^th minute, but that will be all.  Back and forth the game will stumble along, but from the 75^th minute on we'll be playing 8-10 in the box to try to stop the constant pressure from Swansea.

We will win 1-0, but only because of two great saves: one by Mignolet, the other by the woodwork.

Besides the shape issue neither of the front two strikers were able to impose themeleves as outlets for long balls, though Eto'o surpsingly was able to make some layoffs and so on. Ba could be quite useful here, we've seen how good he can be with those kinds of balls.

It seems the 4-2-3-1 will continue to be our main formation, but we could see that 3-5-2 again if we're chasing a lead, fairly sure Mourinho also used it at Real Madrid.

Something like this

I'm sure many of you agree that this is ridiculous and that taxes paid by the Northern Irish public should not be used for Edwin Poot's own ends.

I don't pay taxes to discriminate against people.

Which is why I want to create a petition on Change.org or here, http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/, for something to be done against Edwin Poots.

I think thousands will support him being taken out of the post of Health Minister, not only for this, but also the Blood Donation fiasco in the past.

EDIT - Kathyrn Torney with The Detail tweeted that Poots confirmed Â£37,112 in legal fees has been spent to try and ban gay men giving blood and Â£17,000 appealing court decision which said banning civil partners adopting children was illegal.

Thats over Â£54,000 of money taken from the Department of Health's budget.

My issue with the Niqab is that is has no basis within Islam, it's a purely social and cultural construct, however it does, i feel, both fly against the ideals of living in a free, civilised and inclusive society as well as alienating those who wear it from the general public. 
I also know of no women who wears it who does so without the pressure of the males in her life or many years of being told all men will only see her as a sexual object and it'd stop unwanted advances....

My question essentially is why can't i as a brown man (if we have such powerful equality laws here in blighty) wear a balaclava in public and when asked say that i'm afraid that due to my religion i can't remove it because i don't want anyone but my wife to see my face lest i get unwanted sexual contact? 

I know the simplest answer will be because i'll be ass'tacked by the police and security services if i walk down a high street with it on but i would like to know if there is any basis under UK law to enable me to do this and test out the reactions.

So, by some amazing feat I've been offered a room onsite at Queens' College (Cripps Hall). Only here's the catch: the building I'm in is half a conference building and half for first year undergraduates--I'm a 23 year-old first-year graduate student. I've been allocated to the conference half, which means my furniture is pristine, river view, all the works... but I will likely have very temporary/unsuitable neighbors (like wedding parties and traveling business groups). This link contains photos of some typical rooms: http://www.queensconferences.com/conference

The other accommodation I was allocated to is more like a large hostel. It's just under a mile away, so about a 15 minute walk into campus. It's 900 pounds cheaper for the whole year. The biggest plus though, is that it's entirely first-year graduates. So tons of neighbors/similar minds to get on with and just a larger networking pool in general. Here are some photos of this one: http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/page-1500 (Bottom of the page.)

I've never studied at Cambridge but have studied further south for quite a while. So I'm familiar with the terrible weather I'll be walking through each day from off-site, but am also familiar with a more interactive life life on campus... and the likelihood I'll attend more course-specific events, etc.  

I'd really appreciate any advice anyone could offer. I'm really stuck! 

Best, and Thanks!

We are a new team going by the name of POTN, aka POTM of the Night. We are looking to recruit two players to complete our line-up - those two players filling the second support role as well as the solo mid. The three of us have played competitively together in a previous team though only playing in small, amateur tournaments and ladders. However, we aim to participate in more competitions in the future as well as attend LAN events.  


**About us:**
As mentioned previously, we do not possess tons of competitive experience though we're all competent players. We've played DOTA 2 since early beta as well as a couple of years of HoN prior. We have good knowledge of the game overall along with the competitive scene. We also have competitive LAN experience from playing CS:S.

Regarding how often we play together, we currently play most evenings and we'll be looking to keep this up with our two new additions.

A little bit about us outside of the game - the three of us are in our early 20s. Two of us currently live in Birmingham with the third member about an hour outside. As stated, we've attended multiple LAN events together in the past, namely the i-series, and this is something we'll be looking to do with DOTA.


**What we would like from you:**
Although relative competitive experience is more than welcome it isn't really a requirement. The experience will come from playing together on a regular basis.

Able to play either support alongside our in-game captain or the solo mid role. You should also be able to play a large variety of heroes within your designated role (exceptions made for micro intensive heroes).

We want you to be like-minded and share our aspirations. This means that you'd be preferably willing to attend LAN events in the future to participate in tournaments.

Maturity is a must though there are no specific age restrictions. As long as you fit in with the above then it should be fine.

And last but not least, we'll be looking to play most evenings with the exception of weekends so being able to fit into our schedule is necessary.
