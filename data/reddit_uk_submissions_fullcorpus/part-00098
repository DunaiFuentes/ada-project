So I'm going to put a bunch of easy questions and some hard ones to make the leader board a little bigger.

Q1: When Jody Morris scored from around 40 yards, who was the player that dummied a header to send the keeper the wrong way?

Q2: When was Chelsea FC founded? **Answered**

Q3: Name Chelsea's first starting 11. (Kinda redundant as everyone will google this)

Q4: Name our last 10 managers and what years they came/left. This includes anyone who was in charge (even for 1 match) **Answered**

Q5: Who was our manager during the 1954/55 season? **Answered**

Q6: Which Chelsea striker had the nickname 'Gatling Gun'? **Answered**

Q7: Which Chelsea player had the nickname 'Butch'? **Answered**

Q8: Who scored a penalty for Chelsea where the ball never crossed the line?

Q9: Who was Gudjohnsen's best striking partner before Mourinho came in? **Answered**

Q10: What number did the song 'Blue Is The Colour' reach on the UK singles chart? **Answered**

Edited 11th question as it's my lucky number: 

Q11: How many games did Chelsea play in the 1940-41 first division?

So, I arranged a trip with my father to Edinburgh for the 1st/2nd/3rd of July, However he now can't make it due to work commitments. The room and the train however are still paid for, so I'm going to just come on my own. 

Does anyone know of any good events that are going on, or of ideas for how I might meet people in the city? Plus, how can I fill my days. Can you suggest your fav museums/parks etc? I have been once before but it was many many years ago so I'm at a loss. I'm 24/M/Brit, confident and friendly enough, but any help is appreciated.

Cheers!

I've never had any guidance from family regarding education. I went to my school's 6th form with no idea that A levels were used to get to uni and none of my family had ever uttered the word 'university' and I had no idea of the work load and soon dropped out.

(I don't blame my family for everything, I admit to being lazy at times)

I went to a really crappy college the year later to study a BTEC and without sounding arrogant, I knew I was too intelligent for a BTEC and after a few months I left.

After 6 months working part time, I realised getting an apprenticeship wouldn't be a mad move and last March I was taken on at a solicitors in the accounts department.

I've been here nearly 4 months and it's hell. For once I've found something I feel at home at, but the setting is horrible. I'm not learning a thing, nobody has time to teach me anything, my boss won't buy me the software required to work and so the only time I do actual accounts work is when my older colleague leaves, and even then it's only number typing and requires no thought or opinion.

I have no confidence in my role either, I am terribly under-trained and make frequent errors and I feel completely inadequate and stupid.

When I have had a tiny taste of actual accounts work I've really enjoyed it. I'm torn between leaving my job and looking for another accounts apprenticeship, staying at my current job and waiting to be trained, or leave and re do my A levels and actually commit myself.

However, I have no idea what costs I'll pay or whether I can study A levels while working.

(Clint Dempsey has been nominated but has insufficient votes to draw conlcusions)


A few observations:

When you look at the results, with 3 of our central midfielders strongly nominated, its actually quite obvious that a midfielder is a bigger priority than a striker right now which puts the Paulinho deal in to perspective and puts a warm happy feeling in your stomach that says ""the guys in charge really do know what they're doing"".

A lot of people want Defoe to stay and Ade wasn't even nominated meaning that we only need 1 more striker and everyone would be happy with the back up which would really be 4 deep if we include Dempsey.

Benny can stay. We have the options of playing Benny, Danny, Jan or Kyle N at LB which I think is hard to improve upon with realistic available LB's on the market right now

No one mentioned Gomes, which I find surprising. I'm of the opinion that we need to bring in a young promising keeper (between 20 and 23 years old). Our number one keeper is currently our youngest keeper by 6 years. I assume Brad will retire at spurs in a year or two and then our backup will be a 33 year old that everyone lost faith in.

With the returns of Kaboom, The Beast, Andros (needs a nickname), and Danny oh what a goal Rose (I just made that one up) as well as Tommy Caroll breaking in. We are starting to look deep with talent. If we ship Parker, Livermore and Ceballos for a season, and buy a midfielder (read Paulinho) and a striker (read Villa?). I think we can sit back and look smug. YIDDO YIDDO YIDDO.

During my short stay in 6th form I studied A Level Psychology and found it incredibly interesting and I was genuinely good at it.

If I take a Psychology Degree at The OU, will I be out of my depth?

Had I stayed on and completed my A level Psych exam, I am confident I would have achieved an A, but will I need prior knowledge when attempting a Degree?

Have any of you completed an OU degree without completing an A Level in the same field?

The site has been going for almost four years and, assuming the sun comes out, we're expecting about 1m users/month over the summer, before pushing into new markets during the autumn/winter.

Our small team of developers work mainly in Python and Django, achieving multiple awards and great reviews for ease of use and speed (http://www.reviewcentre.com/Travel-Agents/Pitchup-com-www-pitchup-com-reviews_1369575). Behind the scenes we've built some pretty nice features to help campsite owners manage their vacancies and encourage them to sign up.

Pitchup.com was cited at the recent W3C/ODI/OKF Open Data on the Web event http://www.w3.org/2013/04/odw/ we're aiming to go beyond the typical travel site by integrating POIs like public transport, tourist attractions and pubs. We were also among the early users of Twitter's recently-launched product cards and autocomplete.

We're looking for a couple of people to work on things like payments, international expansion, testing and personalisation, mobile and geo (backend stack is Python / Django / Postgres / Celery / nginx / S3).

The business is profitable and was founded in 2009 by former lastminute.com staff with a background in the holiday park sector. We're regularly featured in the national press, and our lively, friendly team is based at the Barley Mow Centre off Chiswick High Road in west London.

Please drop me a line if you're interested in more information, or apply at http://www.pitchup.com/jobs/

Requirements

* Expert in Python, with knowledge of at least one Python web framework (ideally Django)
* Good PostgreSQL experience
* Very strong JavaScript skills
* Familiarity with nginx server environments
* Willingness to undertake sysadmin work
* Some remote working is possible, and some on-call evenings and weekends will be required

Treasury agrees to guarantee massive regeneration programme across Haringey, including Tottenham’s new stadium project

The government has agreed to provide a £500m guarantee for a massive regeneration plan across the Tottenham area of London, which includes Tottenham Hotspurs’ new stadium development.

The move to underwrite the Tottenham regeneration plan through the UK Guarantees scheme, revealed in documents published alongside the spending review announcement on infrastructure today, will see the government guarantee Haringey council’s plans to embark on a major regeneration programme across the borough.

Haringey council said Treasury’s commitment meant the council and the Greater London Authority, in partnership with the private sector, could now press ahead with financial security for its plans to transform the area, which include thousands of new homes and jobs as well as better transport links, leisure facilities and business workspace.
The council said £1bn of investment was already committed to the regeneration programme, which comprises a range of different projects across the borough, including Tottenham Hotspur’s £400m stadium development plans, known as the Northumberland Development Project.
Haringey council leader Claire Kober said: “I am delighted that Haringey council’s ambitious regeneration plans for Tottenham have now been given secure financial backing by the government.
“Today’s £500m guarantee means we can now get on with the task of bringing up to 10,000 new high-quality homes and more than 5,000 new jobs to Tottenham with confidence, giving better opportunities to local people.”
“We’re well on our way to bringing change to this community, but today’s announcement means we can step up and truly transform Tottenham.”
The UK Guarantee for Tottenham’s regeneration follows earlier guarantees to the £225m project to convert half of the Drax coal-fired power station into biomass, and a further guarantee for the Northern Line extension to Battersea Power Station.
Today Treasury secretary Danny Alexander also announced that the £10bn Hinkley nuclear power project was eligible for a “multi-billion pound” UK Guarantee, as well as the £600m Mersey gateway bridge project, which will be underwritten by up to £500m.
The UK Guarantee scheme was launched July 2012 in a bid to accelerate up to £40bn worth of major infrastructure projects.
Today Alexander also said the government would extend the life of the UK Guarantee programme by two years to 2016.

I love watching Dr. Who, but my wife and I are only casual collectors of trinkets and doodads related to the show.  So few stores here sell the mystery packets and we went in to buy 10 and my ""magic fingers"" found all that we wanted, but when it came to searching for the sonic-screwdriver of The 11th Doctor, this one popped into my hand before a common one did....quite luckily as I would have stopped after finding a Doctor.  The store had us on the system of allowing us to open the packages before buying them.  This made searching and avoiding duplicates easier.

Anyway, we like the figure and the nice shiny gold plated base, but it seems like such an oddity that it would be found in the least likeliest of places and ever so much after the 2011 release.

We've been linked to tons of players, none more so than Henrikh Mkhitaryan. We've already added Luis Alberto, and we've already got a pretty dang good set of players in the middle of the pitch. That being said, in many games last season, I felt as though our players didn't exactly fit together. Especially in Brendan's system, the midfield is the heart of the team, and it's vital that all the cogs are working in harmony. So here's my take on the situation.



We play mostly in a 4-2-3-1, but here I'm going to be talking about the players who would fit in the middle of a 4-3-3, cause the wings are another thing in themselves that i don't want to get into. I know our formation isn't static but hear me out...



Who we have: Gerrard, Lucas, Allen, Henderson, Coutinho

Last season we played almost exclusively with two holding midfielders, Gerrard and Lucas, with one man above them between the wings. At various points this was Sahin, Henderson, and Coutinho.



What we need...
Not WHO we need, but WHAT (we'll talk who later). Ideally, from the two holding positions, we will satisfy 3 traits: distribution, defensive ability, and work rate.
The biggest issue that I see is that, when Gerrard and Lucas play side by side, we lack the work-rate aspect. To compensate, we played Henderson heavily, and expected him to get back and compensate for the other two. Lets say, for arguments sake, that they will be, for the majority of the season, be paired again next year. This is where Micky fits. He gives the work rate of Henderson, but adds significantly more in terms of offensive capability. I really don't see Henderson as an ideal CAM, which is why Coutinho played there at the end of the year. Micky would solve our patchwork midfield, but I think there are bigger issues at the heart.


Gerrard: He's captain fantastic, we all love him. It would be ridiculous to question his ability. That being said, he has plenty of flaws. For the position he's currently playing the two biggest are that he's not a great tackler (decent, but not great), and his legs are shot. Brendan seems intent to play him as much as possible. I don't fault the idea, but, if we're going to, he MUST play next to someone who can tackle AND run for days.

Lucas: Does not have the legs to play with Gerrard. I love him, but it's true. He tackles phenomenally, but he is oppressively one dimensional. In a Barca style midfield, with only one holding, he would be perfect, but for us, i actually see him as a better compliment to Allen than Gerrard.




So what are we to do?

In the short term, i think the best answer is to split up the current defensive midfielder pairing. Gerrard-Henderson, or Lucas-Allen. This is in no way a perfect solution, but ,complimented by a player like Mkhitaryan at the top of the triangle , i think either would be adequate for the average PL fixture.



Long term... 
In two seasons, if Gerrard is still a nailed on starter, it will speak of our weakness in midfield. Unless we're going to completely change our system, he will never become Pirlo.
Brendan has said that in his ideal scenario, we would play two advanced midfielders instead of two holding. I actually think he's got it pretty well set up to do this in the Barcelona mold. Allen=Xavi, Henderson=Iniesta, and Lucas=Busquets. The problem is that i dont think any of them are good enough.




Possible purchases...

Wanyama- Possibly a pipe dream, but, even if he is, a player similar to him is necessary. Not only would he fit perfectly at the bottom of a midfield triangle, but I also see him as the perfect compliment to Gerrard in the short term. Work rate, strength, tackling ability. Plus i just like the idea of a big, intimidating African in our midfield.


Mkhitaryan- Short term: A huge improvement over Henderson at the top of the triangle. He would give us loads of versatility and a more attacking presence in the center of the pentagon. Long term: its hard to say how the squad will develop, but he could easily be a Downing replacement, CAM, or creative holding midfielder.

I'd like to see five or more colleges (including St. Johns and Clare) and two departments (Economics and Land Economy), but I'm really uncertain as to how long will be spent at each college talking to admissions tutors and looking around.

If there is something that you really think I need to see then please let me know, but as I said I know the city relatively well and have been to lots of the more well known places such as King's college and The Cambridge Union on school trips and competitions.

But what is very interesting in each of these adventures is that there is a cameo from the **Eleventh Doctor**! He typically gives advice and clues to his past selves or even sends a past Doctor to a destination where they have the adventure. But I keep wondering why he is contacting them and what is up to.

Here is his cameos so far in various detail as up to *Trouble in Paradise*.

**Hunters of Earth**
A DJ on a radio gives a dedication to Susan and her friend Cedric. It was sent by someone calling themselves 'The Doctor' along with a message.

Here is the full transcript of the DJ speaking on the radio
&gt;Music lovers and here's a special message for Susan Foreman and not least of all her friend, the mighty Cedric. And this is from, well our geezey here says, he's a doctor. (Laughs) Wait a mo, he says he is THE DOCTOR. Now how impressive is that listeners? Now...wonder what's in his casebook...? And he hopes you're having a real groovy time in the swinging sixties. Miniskirts and Telstars, Steve Zodiac and Fireball XL5, Flower Power and Woodstock...Flower power? Woodstock? What's he talking about? Hey Sue, maybe your friend is a tiny bit...(laughs) spaced out?...if you know what I mean. And let's see what your trippy friend has got to say to you, Sue. What's this? Something about the Beatles never catching on with all those soppy love songs?

&gt;Hey! I think your friend has gone a too bit far here, Sue. We all dig that Mersey beat around here. But, each to his own, I guess. Now, what else has he got to say? Looks like it's a message from Boy Cedric! It's blowing in the wind, Cedric. Whatever that might be... And remember, it's all in the beat. Don't let Cedric forget that Sue, he says. The Doc says, It's all in the beat. Oh, and he wants you to enjoy your coffee at Rosa's too. (laughs) Well, we sure get some crazies here from time to time, but that's 1/2 the fun. And now here's another one from everyone's fab favs, The Beatles! And remember to tune in on Tuesday evening when we'll have a whole hour devoted to our lovable Merse...

Apart from this, Susan has a premonition that something terrible is coming far in the Doctor's future and that it is part of his *destiny*.

**Shadow of Death**
The Eleventh Doctor sends the Second Doctor a message using his psychic paper. I can't remember what the message is. Later the Second Doctor briefly views the future Doctor via a psychic link, describes his future incarnation's bow tie as ""rather fetching.""

**Vengeance of the Stones**
The Doctor sends a message to the Third Doctor via a recording on a telephone, again I don't know what the message was.

I have been trying to apply for a tuition financing loan through DirectGov and it is a bit of a hassle. I'm asking you here on this subreddit because I cannot think of any better. Hope I'm not breaking any rules by posting this .self post.

Anyhow:

On the application's first page, the website asks me if I have lived in a EEA country etc for three years before the course start and I answer yes. Poof, application not for me and I have to send letters and whatnot, although the website mentions that I can apply online if I'm intending only on taking tuition fee loans. I answered no and got further in the form where I multiple times mentioned that I live in Sweden and it did not affect a thing. Weird yes, but I'm glad it worked.

What I've understood is that I, as an EU student, am only eligible of taking tuition fee loans of £9,000 a year. Strangely, the form [suddenly suggests that I am allowed to get maintenance loans from the UK](http://i.imgur.com/6K2Lpvc.png). Weird, isn't it...

Additionally, look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/yOiqUSx.png). I have stated somewhere else in the application that I'm an EU resident, not a UK. I went to check that part and it did show that I clearly was registered as a EU national.

Maybe I'm just too tired to actually be able to submit such a form, but I really need some clarifications here if you don't mind.

- What am I eligible for, as a Swedish student in the UK, grant and loan-wise?
- How do I apply for these loans and grants?
- How do I get a National Insurance no. and do I really need it?

This all is a big clusterfuck that's making me feel like a dumb idiot. Please make this a little easier to understand...

Thanks beforehand folks.

I had arranged to move into somewhere smaller so I could actually afford to live but she was adamant I stay put and keep the flat so I did. Two months ago my job went tits up so I was hard up and asked my other half to cover the rent for that month which she agreed to to. Rent day came and went with no word from the lettings agent so I imagine she took care of it but a week later I had an arrears note. I called them to explain that she must have had trouble sending over the money as she is a proper remote location at the moment but I said I'd talk to her. I messaged her on Facebook as it's our only means to talk but she has blanked me completely. As in, not even acknowledging the messages I've sent but still being active on Facebook. I'm not an idiot, she's fucked me off leaving me behind in rent and without a penny to my name so I explain to the landlord the situation and he was pretty understanding. As you can imagine, my friends flocked around to help me out and just cheer me up so we've had a pretty solid party going for a few days. Nothing crazy at unreasonable times, it's been pretty civil at night when it's quiet but the day gets a bit noisy but not to the point of rioting or anything. I have been boxing stuff up for days so you can imagine the flat is a tip. I have been sorting out what to throw, what's hers and what's mine, it's a shambles and the party made the room look well untidy. I had a friend drop by a few hours ago to help me move the first of the stuff and when I got home, I was knackered as I'd been up for to days straight so I had a sleep. I was awoken by two of my landlords relatives berating me on the state of the place. My landlord had opened the door for them and they came right in while I was crashed out on the settee and had a go. They were walking all around the flat moaning something about it being their inhertiance and how I live like a bum. I don't. I was actually painting the walls before I was forced to make a move and you can imagine the cumulative state of the place after having the decorating gear out, having just had a two day session and trying to get everything moved and sorted. It did look a shambles to be fair but in the four and a half years I've lived in the flat, this is the only time it did look a proper state and these two came in at exactly the wrong time. They left after some words and I thought nothing of it, one of them seemed alright, so I went to go get a milkshake. My landlord, the two guys and two women I'd never seen before started having a right go at me outside my door saying that I started on someone (?) and how I'm being a dick for not paying the rent despite me being nothing but open and honest with the landlord anyway.

So is he just allowed to let family into the house to have a go at his tenants or can I actually get a bit of retribution somehow? The property is managed by a lettings agent as well, its not a direct rental from the landlord.

now what remains is to complete the key signings that will propel us to a top 4 position.  so this is what i consider the players we need to sign to achieve this goal.

Wanyama - We haven't had a DM like him since Momo (pre eye injury).
Celtic want 13 million pounds.  I say we give them Shelvey + 5M pounds.  As long as their is a buy back clause.  He will gain much experience playing in Scotland then West Ham or Swansea, plus CL football too.

Micky Ryan - 25 million pounds.  Just pay the whole amount, sign HIM !

Toby A - A right footed Agger?  Yes please!  Sell Coates + Assaidi + 3M pounds.

If Suarez goes his funds will cover Micky Ryan's fee + whatever striker we replace him with.

I dont know why we havent made a bid for Thiago Alacantra (sp?).  Sell Henderson + 5M pounds.  What an upgrade!

We need another left back.  Either get Ilori for 4M pounds, or make a big for Baines (~12M pounds i would imagine).  We could sell Skrtel to fund this move.

So as u can see there are many options available, most within a reasonable price range.  move quickly and we CAN challenge for a top four position!",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,what we need and how to get it,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1h8afz/what_we_need_and_how_to_get_it/

Just remembered about something pretty awesome that only a fan would understand. As I soon found out from the blank expressions on my fellow contestants faces ;)

Well that being said, I recently finished competing on The Biggest Loser Australia. Now if anyone has watched these types of shows they will be well accustomed to the ""Letters from Home"". We received our letters in January. After a typical message my Dad who was writing the letter but in perhaps the greatest P.S of all time...

""P.S Demba Ba now plays for Chelsea, possibly signing Fellaini in the coming weeks (he didn't mark it with [Rumor])"" 

Of all the things in that damn letter, the main thing that brought a smile to my face was the little bit of Chelsea news he managed to get in for me. We had no access to news, results, anything. After this a couple of the producers at least told me some results ;)

Just a little story from a fan on a slow news day ;) Onwards to the premiership next season :D

FYI - Imagine going 3 months of knowing nothing about your beloved Blues (its torture)...

Got a kitchen ceiling with sags.  Basically started with a straight line crack appearing along width of ceiling and seems moisture has got in leading to sagging of skimming.

I'm getting someone round to quote for sorting it out.  Not sure whether plasterboard will need to come down as well or if it can just be skimmed over.

Whats a good price for either situation?  The room is a 12ft x 8ft roughly.

I don't always agree with violence but sometimes it's the only way people will sit up and take notice, peaceful protests don't seem to do anything any longer and polititions seem to be more self serving than ever.

I'll keep the story short, basically we have neighbours who are overly nosey like watching everything we're doing and even going as far as putting secruity cameras up facing onto our property, they have admitted this BUT they are hidden. Anyway , it's basically to the point where they've been looking in our windows, watching what we're doing outside all the time etc and after being asked to stop haven't. We have told the police now 3 times and they wont do anything about it, told the doctors as it's given my mum depression and been to solicitor so it's well documented but has gone on for years now.

Anyway thing's came to bit of a head about 3 nights ago when they stared in our windows while my mum and dad were sitting watching tv,, In which my dad decided to confront them about it. It was just an argument but they were coming out with some real deluded stuff like "" If you don't want us looking in then put up a higher fence"". My dad lost it at that point and gave the guy a shove and walked away. Today he was arrested for this , I was just wondering what would likely to  come of this, if anything?

I think right now it makes financial sense for me, however I really don't want to give up living with other people.

I currently rent a room in a 6 bedroom house. I pay £700/pcm with all bills included. I've lived in shared houses since I was 18. I'm now 23 years old, and I don't plan on changing that any time soon.

I earn £80k a year + bonuses. I have no debt. I have £50k savings, and £10k emergency fund. I have good credit, as I've used a credit card since I was 18 for most of my expenses, but have never failed to pay the balance in full at the end of the month. My job is stable, I've been employed here for 2 years, and that's not likely to change any time soon.

So my question is about buying a house a bit bigger than I need. Maybe a 3 or 4 bedroom, with the intent to let out the other rooms, while living there myself. The idea of buying the bigger house isn't a financial one, although it seems like it might be advantageous, financially. I simply don't want to live on my own. Has anybody successfully done this? Are there any horror stories? Are there any glaringly obvious reasons not to do this?

I have already maxed out my ISA for this year.

I have also maxed out in premium bonds, which gives me a nice return of avg. £50/month. I have also invested in a Stocks and shares ISA.

Currently, my expenditure is very low, since I am living at home with my parents. The main thing I spend on at the moment is petrol.

I inherited the majority of the money, however I have also worked quite hard to earn some myself. Currently, I do not have a job though, since I am going travelling for a few weeks, and then I will be off to uni in September.

If anyone has any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it.

My basis of the British media is based around their treatment of Luis - from the biting incident to the Evra incident to any little thing he does that they perceive to be the latest worst thing ever that he has done.  My main frame of reference for this was the reactions after the biting.    

Meanwhile, over here in the US, there is currently a murder investigation revolving around one of our football (gridiron) players.  The player is a high profile player for one of the most successful and high profile organizations in the NFL (if anyone wants to Google it, his name is Aaron Hernandez).  The evidence that he was at least involved in the murder is pretty damning (texts sent by the victim seem to imply that he is with Hernandez, Hernandez destroyed his cellphone and home security system on the night of the murder and had a cleaning crew come in to his house the next day, etc.).  Yet the sports media here has pretty much just simply reported this case.  Hernandez has not been cast in any particular role to fit a story or narrative that suits the media.  I was struck by the difference between the way that this is being reported versus the way Luis' actions have been been reported.  

I realize their are differences (primarily the fact that there were cameras that show Luis' actions)
I know a lot of us sympathize with Luis when he when it comes to his treatment by the media, but I think this can kind of highlight it.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a Luis apologist.  I think he needs to cut the shit with his transfer talk and he could have certainly done a lot to avoid getting himself in the situations he has.  But I think the media acts like he is the only person to ever do those things or he has done them worse than everyone else.

The assumption, I believe, is that the doctor spent ~200 years traveling and then came back to see Amy &amp; Rory again between the episode where he drops them off, and the episode when he comes back to battle the Cybermen.

But in The Wedding of River Song we don't really get any indication that 200 years has passed.  Obviously he could have been out doing all kinds of crazy things for all that time just to come back to 2011 because he knew he had to die and wanted to hook up with Craig one last time and then Amy, Rory, and River.

But if that's the case, and 200 years has indeed passed, then why does he pick now to come back to 2011?

Basically i was wondering how we we use him in the team due to our evident abundance in attacking mids.

My opinion on if we were to sign him all comes down to where we would use him. As i doubt he would work as an out and out central midfield player and all the signs are pointing to us moving away from a system with a designated attacking mid in the formation. So after this I thought that we may of actually identified him as an alternative to Bernard and essentially do with him what we did with Siggy and turn him into an inside left/ left forward then with this play a similar way to the Bayern do with Ribery and Robben but in our case Mkhitaryan and Bale.

Osvaldo was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, but because of a great-grandfather who was born in Italy he was able to qualify for Italian citizenship.  Because of this he has played his international career with Italy, making 8 appearances and scoring 3 goals.

Osvaldo exploded onto the scene in 2010-11 when he average more than a goal every 2 games with Spanish club Espanyol, netting 14 times in 26 appearances.  This performance drew interest from larger clubs, and he was sold to AS Roma for 17.5 million Euros.  Osvaldo has enjoyed great success for the Serie A side, scoring 11 goals in 26 appearances his first season, and adding another 17 in his 31 appearances this past season.  His league goal tally of 16 in 2012-13 put him as the third top-scorer, bested only by Antonio Di Natale and Edinson Cavani.

Do you think Osvaldo's game could translate over to the Premier League?

What is a fair price for him?  Would we be willing to pay it?

If he was our lone striker signing, would you be happy? 

Might he be able to pair up well with the likes of David Villa?

“So Clara where to next?” Said the doctor whilst leaning against the TARDIS panel.

“Surprise me!”Replied Clara

“Okay then, prepare to be surprised, Clara Bartholomew Oswald.” Said the doctor while working the TARDIS

“Bartholomew?” Replied Clara inquisitively.

	The Doctor pulled the switch and the TARDIS shook and tumbled around whilst Clara and The Doctor held on. As the TARDIS steadied The Doctor said “What, Bartholomew is a good name, I like Bartholomew it has a certain..” The Doctor was interrupted by a large beep sound. As both Clara and The Doctor looked around, the TARDIS began to flash and shake. Soon the entire TARDIS lost power except for a low light surrounding the room. The Doctor grabbed his screen pulled it towards himself and knocked on it, and abruptly a little green radar popped up showing the TARDIS in the middle as a small white dot, and another white dot behind it curving into a collision course. 

	“Oh no, Oh no, this is bad, this is very very bad.” The Doctor said frantically as he pushed all the buttons and pulled all the levers on the panel.
“What is it?” Replied Clara in a scared yet excited voice.
“Clara grab something and hold on tight, this is going to be one bumpy ride.” Said The Doctor.
	
	Clara ran over and Grabbed the rail whilst the doctor did the same.
“Is this the surprise?”Said Clara.
“Its a surprise all right, but not a intended ...”The Doctor was interrupted yet again by a ferocious bang and the TARDIS shook and rolled as it never has before. Sparks erupted from everywhere and smoke clouded the TARDIS as it made a screeching horrible metal-grinding noise. Clara rose from the floor and waved her hand in the smoke while coughing.
	
	“Doctor?” said Clara in a low scared tone.

	Soon the smoke began to clear and she could see The Doctors hand on the panel and she walked over to help him up. Whilst doing so she said “Doctor are you okay, and what was that?”. The Doctor stood and looked at Clara. Whilst Clara seemed completely stunned, shocked and terrified. 

	“Ummmm, Doctor?”Said Clara stunned. 
The Doctor shook his head and said “Rose you sound different, did the smoke...” He stopped talking as he looked up. “Who was this?” thought Clara. She began to look at him closer. He had spiky hair in the front, was wearing a brown trench or overcoat, and he had a completely different voice. Also no bow-tie. As Clara was looking over who-ever this was, so was The Doctor of Clara, and what he could deduce was “Not blonde” he thought.

Right now without any new signings other than paulinho, i still think he will be behind bale, lennon, holtby, dempsey(maybe this isn't a popular opinion but in an off year without a full preseason the guy still was our 3rd leading scorer and much more consistent than siggy), and townsend.  And with the potential switch to a 4-3-3 his chances just go down.  This is of course if we don't bring in another attacking mid, which if we do only drops him further down the depth chart.

Secondly, I went to do my nails tonight in preparation for tomorrow and found I don't have the exact shade of pinky brown to match said heels so I'm going to have to pop out to Boots tomorrow morning to get it. I already own almost 70 polishes...15 of which are different shades of pink.

I'm only a few episodes in but so far the new characters are boring and completely unlikable. Rudy isn't great enough to keep the show going on his own. 

I found Nathan's sudden disappearance hard to adjust too, but I did end up liking Rudy. I think it could have been handled a little better if they made an actual episode out of what happened in Vegas, and gave Nathan a better send off. It would have been a much better transition. But what's done is done. 

I also think Season 4 would have been much better if they didn't have to write off Kelly. Keeping 3 lovable characters would have worked better than just having Rudy.

Matt Smith is actually the 12th Doctor, not the 11th, since they are inserting a hidden one before Eccleston (the doctor who went bad).  So, when Matt smith leaves in the Christmas Special, the next doctor becomes the last Doctor, right?

The two conflicting episodes are the ""Asylum of the Daleks"" and the ""Name of the Doctor."" 

To recap:
The plot of the Asylum is that the Daleks heard a noise on their planet that scared them. The Daleks send the Doctor down to the planet to investigate. The Doctor later finds out that this noise is Oswin Oswald.

Fast foward to episode 14:
The plot of this episode is irrelevant, it's the end of the episode that intrigues me. Clara jumps into the Doctor's time stream to SAVE him from the Great Intelligence and various other things throughout his timeline. This includes ""saving"" him in the Asylum.

But wait, that's where it gets confusing for me. The whole reason that the Doctor was in the Asylum in the first place was because Oswin was there. If Clara hadn't injected herself into that part of his time stream, he would have never been put in the danger where Oswin was forced to save him. 

My only thought on this is that maybe the part where Oswin deletes the Doctor from the Dalek's memory banks was a way of saving him in a future story.

This post season so far has been a whirlwind of magical signings so far, and the best part is the window **DOES NOT OPEN** until monday *officially*. We have had all of the ups and downs, apparent done deals that really aren't done, and the official signings that normal clubs have in the entire window already. We have signed players for *arguably* less than they are worth. This past month has been whimsical, magical, and at points downright frustrating. We've seen Suarez open his mouth spouting his want for a move away from england, specifically to Real; we've seen signings appear almost out of nowhere (*i'm looking at you Mignolet*). 


I have enjoyed this transfer window as I have the past 4 that I have followed extensively, and at times hated it just like every other window. To quote BR ""It's all part of the dance"". This window has seen us sign Iago Aspas (a good signing, should be a strong wing option switching in and out with Downing depending on the opposition), Luis Alberto (a great pick up, I see him covering for Coutinho/ splitting time with Suso in cup games), and Mignolet (who I see fighting for that #1 spot with pepe all season, eventually ending up taking it for good in the latter part of the season), and we've picked up a top defender (as a sub anyway, with the occasional start) in Kolo, who I am hoping will be a rock for us and help with the learning process of the new defender(s) we bring in.


We've been linked with some fantastic players (that we haven't signed officially yet). Of which I want Alderweireld, and Papadopolous the most. We need defenders that fit the mold of the team that BR is trying to build, and bad. As good of a defender as Skrtel is, I just don't see him making it back into the team...so hopefully a reunion between him and Rafa can happen. Both of those targets are young, agile and good on the ball, Papa is a bit bat shit crazy, but that just adds some flavor to the team. Behind them I want HM (which according to many sources is now a done deal, just not officially announced) who I see as an instant starter, especially with his impressive goal tally last season. Behind him I'll say Ilori, and Atsu who together would only cost us around £8-10M. Both of which look promising but are for the future (Illori moreso than Atsu who is 21). 


I am concerned with how much attention has gone to bringing in new attacking options as opposed to picking up players that will fill squad spots that need covering still. I realize we have all window, but pre-season starts shortly and if we are going to be firing on all cylinders come the dawn of the new season, I would like some cover for Lucas and some cover for Enrique.

I also, like the rest of you, want this whole Suarez saga to be wrapped up next week once Suarez is back from international duty. I'm glad that Real has come out and said that they are not interested in him, but I'm not one that's quick to believe something like that. **IF** we hold on to him, I can see us challenging for top 4 next season and I'm very optimistic even should we lose him. *This year is our year* because fuck it i'm tired of always putting it off until *next* year.

Suppose the Doctor was extremely careful and he didn't regenerate all the time, suppose he lives longer than the 11th lives now. Suppose he's still possibly one of the older doctors and the newest ones don't exist in the Whovian world. But he's extremely careful about what he does and he didn't regenerate when he did. If he traveled everywhere, everyday, at every time (and yes I realize this would take an enormous amount of time) would he be going pass his own time period. And like I said, he's very careful and he didn't regenerate when he was suppose to. Could this happen? And if it did, what do you think he would do?

This is just a question I had wondered for a while, I asked my Awhovian friends and they all said it was an interesting question so I was wondering what you guys think?

Everyone is getting excited over nothing but half truths and speculation. It's all fucking Chinese whispers. 

We all know how it works. Some website will make up a tantalising story in order to increase web traffic. Other news sites will get a hold of it and start regurgitating it as fact. Then it just grows and grows into a fat, sweaty, self replicating monster. 

I could start fragging Twitter with a bunch of bullshit, set up a website 'dedicated to bringing LFC news' and I've instantly got the same amount of credibility as thousands of hackney 'journalists' out there, i.e none. 99% of ITK people on Twitter get their info the same way we all do, by going online and searching for it. They don't have friends in the 'business,' they don't have a direct line to LFC, they're full of hot air and bullshit.

Seriously, until Sky Sports, The Guardian, or any broadsheet, or BBC confirm it, it's all generally speculative nonsense.

We all want this guy. We're a boiling kettle at the moment. If we don't sign him it's going to feel like a massive disappointment, even though I can pretty much guarantee that the majority of LFC didn't have a clue who he was before this saga began. What I'm trying to say is don't get disheartened just because we didn't get him, and definitely don't get mad at the club or Ayre. They've donea fantastic job these past six months. It's clear the club has a brilliant scouting network in place and that we're prepared to spend money...wisely. Gone are the days where we're prepared to have our pants pulled down and bent over a barrel for some 'questionably talented' player.

So baby don't cry, you gotta keep your head up. If it falls through, we've got £20 million to spend. Possibly some of which can go towards a certain young Danish chap. As it stands I'm chuffed with the business we've conducted so far. We know that there's still 3 or 4 more players to bring in, and we can be fairly confident that they'll be of a high standard. The theme seems to be to bringing in young players with MASSIVE potential to become world beaters. I genuinely haven't been this excited since 08/09.

2. Gourmet Kitchen Burger (GBK) - Park Street
3. Yoyo Burger - Triangle

My SUBJECTIVE rating system is based on not only the quality of the burger but also the price, for me Burger Joint takes first prize due to the very affordable price and size of portions, compared to GBKs expensive prices.

Other places worth mentioning:

Atomic Burger - Gloucester Road
Jolly Frier's Super Scooby Burger - Filton ave.

[](/twisit) I theorize that because the Thals were exposed to the same radiation that afflicted the Kaleds, they naturally evolved into Dalek-like creatures over time.

* I start work in 2 weeks (15th July) and am looking to be in a house before then.

* Looking to rent, at around **£450-500** per calender month.

* The type of property itself isn't too important, but need at least two, maybe three bedrooms. Ideally not a terrace house.

* Location: can be a few miles from my work place, a  20-30 minutes drive to work would be fine, but not much more than that.

* My girlfriend and I are in our mid-twenties and have a three year old son who is due to start school this September, so an area with **good schools** is a must.

* Low crime area much preferred, obviously!


So I ask you wonderful people for advice on an area/suburb of the city that you think I'll be able to find a property to rent at short notice, within my price range. I've done some Googling, Edgbaston comes up frequently, but I've not looked into cost of rent there yet.

I am a big fan of tabletop RPGs and have been playing since 2007.  I have mostly played D&amp;D, but have also dabbled in Vampire and a few other odd systems here and there.  I have never wanted to run before though, due to the sheer amount of work I know goes into the process (my husband does most of our GMing).

Recently however, I have decided to give a whack at running the DW RPG, Adventures in Time and Space.  I have had all these ideas for Who episodes running around in my head, and I decided that this will probably be the next best thing to actually writing for the show, lol.  

However, like many games based off of a tv series with a strong central character (Buffy springs to mind), this game has a flaw: one player is The Doctor, while everyone else plays companions.  By definition, this gives one player more power and attention than everyone else, and I really dislike that.  So, in order to get around it, I decided to do my game as sort of a spin-off of the main series.

The idea is that a group of Gallifreyan teenagers, sick of the war and idolizing The Doctor, decide to flee and begin new lives by following his example and stealing a TARDIS.  They succeed in doing so, not realizing that at their very moment of departure, The Doctor was putting the time bubble around the war.  Now they have no way to return home.  They have each given themselves new names in the tradition of The Doctor (one, for example, has chose to be called The Professor) and they each have one piece of sonic technology of their choice.  That's where the adventure begins, and I am now preparing 3 minor adventures followed by a huge show-down at the end of the campaign.  So far the first adventure will use Vashta Nerada and the second will use a Jagrafess, but I am uncertain, as of yet, to what comes after that.  For the Big Baddie, I have pulled a relatively obscure villain from one of the comic books. 

Anyhow, I mostly wanted to know whether anyone else has played this game, and what the strong and weak points of it are, as well as look for some feedback on my game idea.  Anything critique is appreciated!  I am also happy to answer any questions about the upcoming game, as I know that none of my players use Reddit.

Updated about a week ago · Taken in Dundee
The Derby Street multis, Hilltown, Dundee are to be demolished on behalf of Dundee City Council by Safedem on Sunday 30 June 2013.

Safedem have been carrying out works at the multis over the past few months in preparation of them being demolished.

The demolition will be carried out under strictly controlled conditions with safety and technical personnel in attendance.

From 8am on Sunday 30 June, an exclusion zone will be set up around the area, with all properties in the exclusion zone being evacuated. The residents and businesses that need to be evacuated have already been contacted.

The evacuation process will begin at 8am and it is expected that the area will be completely evacuated by 10am.

The following road and footpaths will be closed to all traffic from 8am and for the duration of the operation.

Bayne Square
Canning Place
Derby Street
Hastings Place
Mortimer Street
North Street
Reid Square
Russell Place
Bruce Street (From Byron Street to Hilltown)
Byron Street (From Harcourt Street to Mortimer Street)
Hill Street (Eastbound from Bruce Street to Strathmartine Road)
Strathmartine Road (From Hilltown to Strathmore Avenue)
Burgess Street
Canning Street
Fraser Street
Law Road (From No.4 up to Law Hill)
Mid Road
Paterson Street
Reid Street
There will be no vehicle access to Dundee Law

Any vehicles left on restricted or closed roads will be removed.

With the closure of Strathmartine Road, bus services 22 and 1B will be re-routed via Dens Road and Moncur Crescent for the duration of the operation.

Both St Martins Episcopal Church and St Peter and Paul’s Church will not be holding their regular Sunday morning services. Please contact the churches directly for details of re-arranged services.

Those properties closest to the multi storey buildings will be surveyed. Personnel will carry out external visual inspections of these properties using camera equipment in the run up to the demolition. Inspections will also take place immediately before and after the demolition. These inspections are purely a precautionary measure.

There is a strong possibility that dust will be blown through the air from the collapsing building towards homes in the nearby area. Although the dust is not harmful, we strongly recommend that you close all doors, windows and vents and do not hang out any washing during the operation.

On the day of the demolition, we strongly recommend that all pets be kept indoors ensuring that they cannot escape through cat flaps or open windows or doors. Fishponds and rabbit hutches should be covered.

In the unlikely event of any delays, contingency plans have been made. This may result in an extended period of evacuation. Arrangements for evacuees are already in placed, in case an unexpected delay occurs.

Any local residents who have any questions about the operation should contact the Safedem Community Liaison Team on (01382) 811444 or Mobile: 07714 178711 or e-mail them at; clteam@safedem.co.uk",false,dundee,t5_2sh1y,null,null,self,Demolition Today !!! 8am - 10am - Just in case you were not aware !,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/dundee/comments/1hc7dc/demolition_today_8am_10am_just_in_case_you_were/

We immediatley phoned the RSPCA, and within a quarter of an hour they showed up to treat this poor animal as best they can. From the telephone operator to the man who came out they were nothing but helpful and concerned. The nicest of chaps, on his Saturday evening, came out to pick it up and help.

I seem to only hear bad things about the RSPCA but this has certainly proved they do care. Feeling helpless ourselves to help this creature, please help them carry on their good work.

There are theories flying everywhere. Mine, though, is said by some to be pretty good. *I believe that John Hurt, in the Doctor's time stream, is the original Doctor (without any regenerations) from Gallifrey.*

Right below is a small recap of exact quotes from the end of the episode for those who would like a refresher to help with my evidence:

The eleventh doctor, Matt Smith, tells Clara about the figure of John Hurt, ""I said he was me. I never said he was the Doctor."" Matt Smith goes on to talk about his real name not being 'The Doctor' and choosing that name. He tells Clara that his name is like a promise, and the figure of John Hurt broke that promise. John Hurt says that ""What [he] did, [he] did without choice,"" and that this secret event was done ""in the name of peace and sanity."" Matt Smith retorts, ""But not in the name of the Doctor,"" and leaves.

* *EVIDENCE*: I believe the event that they are speaking of is the Time War, where the original Doctor had to destroy Gallifrey to prevent the spread of the Daleks. The destruction is definately going against the name which he had chosen for himself, 'The Doctor' (it was definately not done ""in the name of the Doctor""). It is the Doctor's secret which he regrets greatly, though at the time he would have felt that he was ""without choice"" and that he was doing it in the name of ""peace and sanity"". 

It all makes sense and it all fits. Whovians of Reddit, what is your take on this? Who do you think John Hurt is?

* **Edit - If I had watched the originals, this theory would probably be that John Hurt is the Doctor between 8 and 9, because lovely reddit helped me find out that the time war happened then. But then why wouldn't 9 be 10? And 10 be 11? Etc.? But maybe something else happened to the original Doctor living on Gallifrey that we will find out. But truly, you never know.

Grey Fox on Paulinho:
&gt;Fee agreed, but not done yet, personal terms etc still have to be discussed. I am going on holiday Tuesday and coming back on the 8th July, been told 2 will be signed by then. We are are dealing with a large number of requests from other clubs re our players and I have been led to believe announcements on those will be made early July too.

Frooj on Smith and Obika:
&gt;I've heard it on good authority that Millwall want Smith back and they also want Obika to join them on loan this season.

Jasper on Paulinho:
&gt;I believe it is agents leaking false information (chelskum) to increase the price as it benefits them, if not the fee then wages and bonuses. Paulinho has agreed to move and is fully aware of absolutely everything, and work started before Confeds. His reaction when asked a direct question is not really surprising. I expect him to be confirmed after Confeds. Be very surprised if this was not the case.

JJetset on Zagreb players:
&gt;JJetset said:
We are definitely after 2 Zagreb youth players !! Jedjav is 1 of them!!
THFC 1882 said:
hope the other one is Alen Halilovic 
JJetset said:
Yes it is

[Paul Taylor on Villa:
](https://twitter.com/PTJourno/status/349603685514481666)
&gt;David Villa has agreed personal terms with Spurs. We are just waiting for the club to announce the signing. #THFC #FCB

Jasper on Various:
&gt;Hudd has been told he can leave, and we will listen to offers for Defoe. We prefer to keep Ade in the ideal.

Roger Morgan on Mkhitaryan:
&gt;Shakhtar's striker Mkhitaryan was in a London hotel earlier this week. He wasn't talking to Liverpool. Agent is Mino Raiola, who looks after Ibra and Mario. Very well connected to Baldini.

JJetset on Huddlestone:
&gt;As is expected, told today Huddlestone definitely off, got a few options, not clear where to yet.
JJ followed up with:
The Trouble with the Tom situation is that DL wants big money for him (of course)and he will struggle to pass a medical at another club due to his bone on bone in his ankle. It a serious condition. He may go well elsewhere but no one will pay the big money if he cant pass the medical so DL will have to lower the fee which is a problem.
JJ later said: Worryingly Kabouls knee is similar.

This was about four or five years ago, while at my grandmother's house because my brother was watching. At the time, I dismissed it as being just another TV show because I was preoccupied. Years later, my friends Hannah and Becca got me watching the show legitimately. After the first episode, I will admit that I was exceptionally confused. I had no clue what I had just watched. So I continued to the next episode, which started clearing things up for me, in terms of what the show is about. What I was NOT prepared for was the gigantic fandom that awaited me, or the fact that I was going to have a deep love develop for this impossible madman in a blue box and two hearts and most of his companions. And then, just like that, I came to realize that 9 was no longer the Doctor. He had become 10, and the regeneration was something designed to keep the amazing Doctor alive. I at first, rather disliked David Tennant. Who the hell do you think you are, just strolling in here taking Christopher Eccleston's spot? But then I started to really like 10. He's completely insane by the time he regenerates to 11, but I really loved him. I had Rose ripped away from me, and I cried for nearly four hours. Then came Martha. Oh, Martha. I never really liked her, and I sill could deal without her episodes, but because she was with 10 I grew fond of her. Don't Blink. When Donna showed up I thought she was mad. I didn't like her. But then I realized that she was wonderful. Don't Blink. She didn't know her true potential. She thought she was just some temp. But then in one moment, one shining moment, Donna Noble was the most important woman in the entire universe. And I love her. I thought I died again when she had to forget. Then 10 went and regenerated to 11, Matt Smith. I thought at the time of my first episode with him portraying the Doctor that he was entirely, completely mental, and how on earth could they do this? And then I realized that his insanity was part of the Doctor's natural progression and I love him, just as much as 9 and 10. I met Amy and Rory and thought that they were wonderful. Ever time Rory died, I cried. Remember the Silence and tally marks. Then River's real identity was revealed and I was mind-blown. Impossible, I thought. As series six came to a close, and everything clicked into place, I had to re-watch the few River episodes from before. Had to. Oh the feels, sweetie. As I begin series seven, I am aware that Matt Smith is leaving. I will dislike whomever plays 12, but I will grow to love him. Unless he's Rupert Grint, in which case, the ultimate Ginger has just entered a realm that I love from another I love."") And yet one thing remains, the thing that keeps it going. Through all of the regenerations, through all of the companions, the Doctor has taught me something. Everyone in the universe is important. Everyone deserves second chances. Never underestimate the underdog. Love with everything that you've got, because if you Blink, you may not be able to anymore. Always bring a banana to a party. Wear bowties because they are cool. Never ever set standards for yourself that you won't be happy with or think that you are any less than what you are. There is so much more that I could say, but words cannot describe the amazing things that I've grown to love and know without doing an injustice. To really understand, one must watch Doctor Who. Most will chuckle at the incessant ravings of a fan, call me a nerd and move on. Members of the fandom will understand, some probably will shed a tear. There are a select few who may watch, some who will follow the same path that I have, and others abandon it. I give you a warning, while it is layered with amazing things, there are deep levels of heartbreak and sadness waiting inside this wonderful TARDIS. But it is worth it. Every step, every crushing moment, every laugh, and yes, every scare is totally worth it. Come enter the world I live in. Maybe then you'll understand.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Hello Sweetie (A newcomer's thoughts of Doctor Who),45,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1hckz5/hello_sweetie_a_newcomers_thoughts_of_doctor_who/

First of all, if I am in the wrong subforum, please excuse me! 


**Background story:** I'm a 20 year old university student from Finland. I am a language minority (finnswede) and a major part of my family is 100% swedish. I've never really learnt to master the finnish language very well, and now when I'm older I have difficulties getting a job and fitting in ""with the crowd"". I've slowly started to plan my future, and I don't see myself living in Finland much longer.



I've always been very outgoing towards new cultures/countries and I've been travelling to several countries all over Europe. My all time favourite place so far is the United Kingdom. I've been there twice, first time I went to London and second time to Salisbury (and a quick visit via Bournemouth, Portsmouth and Fareham). I also have my best friend living here, whom I met online circa 2 years ago. I must say, I just love the british people and your culture. You are so open, kind and outgoing and I always feel so welcomed among you.



**Now to the actual questions...** My british friend is excited over the possibility that I would move to the UK. He has promised that he will lend/rent me a room/bed/floor until I get on my feet there. He has also suggested that I would come for a summer first, and see if I like it, and then move there permanently. I think that is a rather good idea.



*Let's say I go there next summer and stay for three months.*

* Do I need a visa? I tried looking it up and it said I wouldn't need one even if I would work? Could that be true?
* How easy would it be to get a job for the summer? I'm not picky, I'm very helpful and well-mannered. I speak english quite well and also swedish and some finnish and german. I have great experience with kids, but I can pretty much work with anything. I have no piercings or tattoos, but I have bright red hair (don't really know if that would be a problem).
* Would it be hard to make friends? I already have my best friend and his group of friends there, but of course I would like to make some friends of my own.
* If I would get ill, do I get free/cheap healthcare without british citizenship? I have travel insurance and a finnish health insurance card.


*Let's say I move there permanently...*

* Would it be difficult to get a somewhat nice job with a finnish university degree? I study social policy, and when I'm done I will have a masters degree (I'm sorry if that would be the wrong title, it's the degree you get after 5 years. Social policy is a part of social sciences).
* Do I have to start worrying about house and pensions for my older days right at the start, or can I leave that to the future?
* Would it be hard to get british citizenship? I've tried reading about it online but I couldn't find out if you would have to do some kind of test when you're allowed to apply.



That's all I can think of right now. I've found a lot of information on the internet about this matter already, but there are still many questions left. **Also, I wouldn't mind if you would share your own thoughts and tips about living in the UK! The questions I wrote down are just things that came to my mind right now.**

He does seem to be consistent and has a good work rate which I like very much (2 things which cannot be taught imo); however, at times he doesn't seem to have a very good awareness of the space or players around him. I saw quite regularly that he when dispossessed it would be from him receiving the ball in an advanced position and being tackled easily from behind. Of course this is something he could work on but is something that is incredibly important in the PL. I'd be very happy if he came obviously but I wouldn't be too disapointed if he didn't and we signed someone in the mould of Eriksen who I think the potential to be a better overall AM/Winger.

2)  Can't the doctor just go back in time and prevent the time war from happening?

3) Do you think it's stupid they called the 2nd time war a ""time war"" when there's only 1 time lord against tons of daleks?

4) Who's your favorite doctor and why?

5) Is Rose a good companion compared to all other companions? (pre- or post-Rose era, doesn't matter)

6) Mickey stayed in the parallel universe, are they gonna see him again?

7). I heard that David TENnant wanted to play the doctor ever since he was a kid, is the reason he left because of the plot, like the writers said he should die here because it's good for the story, or personal choice?

8) Is Eccleston a good actor in your books? Cause he's still my favorite!

Spurs bought Halilovic and Jedvaj for 20 million euros! Tin was the winter, Alen for a year

Author: Davorin Olivari
Posted: 19 minutes ago

We have resolved the transfer of JEDVAJ and Halilovic, we are all agreed with their future club! With a team that will remain with us (not saying who the buyer is), one of them will stay at least a year, said Barisic

What are Sports News announced, there was a rumour yesterday, today it has become official! Tin Jedvaj and Alen Halilovic have been sold! According to Dinamo president Mirko Barisic.

- We completed transfer or Tin JEDVAJ and Alen Halilovic, we are all agreed with their future club! With a team that will remain with us, one of them will stay at least a year.

Is the buying club Tottenham?

- Suffice it to say that they will go ... I do not want the name of the club out in public.

Has everything been signed between the two clubs?

- Well, we can say that everything is resolved.

And is the information that Dinamo will receive 20 million euros on the basis of these two transfers.

- Yes, about this figure.

Speaking of departures, is at the front door and Sime Vrsaljko?

- Važemo the best deal, but by 1 September will all be solved.

So Mirko Barisic. So it's all over, Jedvaj Halilovic will relocate to the Island. Although the president from the previous match was closed when it comes to the name of the club, all unofficial information suggests that the new club the Dinamo two wonderkids will be at isTottenham, the club with the White Hart Lane where great success was seen with (Croatians) Luka Modric, Vedran Corluka and Niko Kranjcar. Dinamo and Spurs have glossy relations, so that the outcome of the story is actually logical. Tin Jedvaj from Dinamo should happen in the winter transfer period when they will be of legal age, and easier to get the work permit. Alen Halilovic is one that will remain ""at least another year.""

Now I feel well and truly out of my depth.

Neymar makes it 2-0 to Brazil. Spain are having a shocker (how often do you get to say that?)

HALF TIME

SECOND HALF

Fred grabs his second, making it 3-0 to Brazil...Surely no way back for Spain now, especially with the way they're playing. 

Jesus Navas has come on, showing that Spain still want this. Hopefully that means Villa will come on too.

PENALTY TO SPAIN

Holy.Fuck. Sergio Ramos has just stuck it wide. If that had gone in, would've made for a very interesting last 35 minutes.

David Villa is coming on! From all the rumours, he could be a Spurs play soon, so now we have 2 Tottenham targets on the pitch. Torres is the one who Villa has replaced.

RED CARD Straight red card for Pique for a cynical tackle on Neymar who was through on goal. Ref had no choice, correct decision.

Great save from Cesar to deny a curling effort from Villa. Villa is looking good, he's still got it, if we get him I think it'll be a great move.

PAULINHO'S Confed cup is over, he's replaced by Hernanes. He had a great game, a very good first half, started to look tired in the second half. He's the real deal. Picturing him alongside Dembele and Sandro is very exciting. He said the transfer will happen after the Confed cup, so hopefully the deal is done in the next few days. I've got everything crossed. Great player.

FULL TIME Brazil 3 - 0 Spain. Thanks to everyone who commented on this watch thread, had a great night talking with all of you, now let's sign Paulinho and Villa.

Also bonus question: which Companion do you think is unnecessarily hated?

For my favorite companion: I would say Romana (second regen), Not only someone from the same planet as The Doctor but is someone who is a TimeLord and can brought a new dynamic. She was also a nice kind person unlike other companions.    

For my least favorite: Peri, It's mainly because she just didn't click for me. Mixed that with what was going on behind the scenes of Dr Who and the poor stories (NO NOT CAVE'S OF ANDROZANI!) I really didn't like her and was not the companion for me. 

The Companion I think is unnecessarily hated on is: Adric, maybe because my family is a big bunch of Dr Who fans so I watched the old series just before the new series aired in 2005 and being a small kid at the time found a 11 year old traveling with the Doctor very cool. (this is also known as the Short Round effect) Also I think a character who is out of there Universe, who's a genius with childish mannerisms (or even is a child in this case) can make a very good character and can be something of a view point for children. Again if done right which was rare but the actor (Matthew Waterhouse) was a good child actor, I also loved the way he went out which actually added to the character of The Doctor and was a companion who he couldn't save and has stayed dead (which is a rarity in New Who) [but it's unlikely Moffot will be bring Adric up any time soon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyWzjJ_HRjA&amp;list=FLvM2lkJM5Rnly6sPyLGyupg&amp;index=1).

My dad used to say that people get the governments they deserve the UK is my home and I feel that its my fault and if I continue to let it happen then it is definitely my fault. It's not the tech, it's the method of communication
If I write a letter to you it is my fundamental, inherent right that that letter will get to you without anyone prying on it.


Nobody is going to stop the mail man and go ""hang on mate, standard procedure, let me read that"" ""ok good, carry on”.


I pay royal mail, royal mail keeps it secure and gets it to you. So why, when I pay sky, can GCHQ go ""yup cheers, lets have a wee look thanks"" ""ok carry on"" just because the medium is more technical?
People don't understand, thats all it is. It's an electrical wire in place of a physical horse cart so why should it be different? I'm still paying a guy to get my message to you.


The worst bit, the Data protection act was born in the 80s, because we were all really upset about the idea that our personal data could be recorded so easily so they dreamt it up, and amended it in the early 90s. What it does is ensure that data collected is relevant to why it was collected, at the consent of the person, used for that purpose only, deleted in a timely manner and not sent abroad.
However, it also, under amendment, allows GCHQ to share with others so GCHQ can come out and say ""guys dont worry, we're abiding by the law, we're keeping your data for 30 days, and once we know it isnt terroristy we delete that info"" ... however, the act states they can share it with the USA, or allies, circumventing the data protection's ""not abroad"" aspect and, when the NSA has the data, they aren't bound by the 30 day clause so, GCHQ can collect the info pass it to the NSA who have better processing facilities and store it for as long as they bloody well like. 


People then say ""well, if you aren't doing anything wrong, you shouldn't worry"". I say fuck that. That is not what privacy is about. 30 years ago homosexuality was a taboo, and in places illegal. What if the morality of the next government changes?

What if something that was legal, is now illegal, and evidence is collectable from stored info to prosecute people who weren't guilty at the time.

I think of anonymous, releasing the information from BNP supporters. Sure the BNP are arseholes. But it is our democratic right in this country to support legal, and official political parties. That is our right.

What if it was suddenly illegal to have voted BNP?

Well... somewhere those who did, are recorded. And what if they get rounded up because 3 years ago they supported and voted for the BNP? What if that info is used to persecute them? and not just them, gay people, unmarried mothers... left handed people whatever! Maybe people predisposed to a certain medical condition. Just random examples.


Privacy is privacy, and it is not about right or wrong, or good or bad. It's about the intrinsic right to mind your own business

If we do nothing, we're all fucked. The entire country has come all this way as the most stable democracy man kind has ever come up with.

“Surprise me!”Replied Clara.
“Okay then, prepare to be surprised, Clara Bartholomew Oswald.” Said the doctor while working the TARDIS
“Bartholomew?” Replied Clara inquisitively.

	The Doctor pulled the switch and the TARDIS shook and tumbled around whilst Clara and The Doctor held on. As the TARDIS steadied The Doctor said “What, Bartholomew is a good name, I like Bartholomew it has a certain..” The Doctor was interrupted by a large beep sound. As both Clara and The Doctor looked around, the TARDIS began to flash and shake. Soon the entire TARDIS lost power except for a low light surrounding the room. The Doctor grabbed his screen pulled it towards himself and knocked on it, and abruptly a little green radar popped up showing the TARDIS in the middle as a small white dot, and another white dot behind it curving into a collision course. 

	“Oh no, Oh no, this is bad, this is very very bad.” The Doctor said frantically as he pushed all the buttons and pulled all the levers on the panel.
“What is it?” Replied Clara in a scared yet excited voice.
“Clara grab something and hold on tight, this is going to be one bumpy ride.” Said The Doctor.
	
	Clara ran over and Grabbed the rail whilst the doctor did the same.
“Is this the surprise?”Said Clara.
“Its a surprise all right, but not a intended ...”The Doctor was interrupted yet again by a ferocious bang and the TARDIS shook and rolled as it never has before. Sparks erupted from everywhere and smoke clouded the TARDIS as it made a screeching horrible metal-grinding noise. Clara rose from the floor and waved her hand in the smoke while coughing.
	
	“Doctor?” said Clara in a low scared tone.

	Soon the smoke began to clear and she could see The Doctors hand on the panel and she walked over to help him up. Whilst doing so she said “Doctor are you okay, and what was that?”. The Doctor stood and looked at Clara. Whilst Clara seemed completely stunned, shocked and terrified. 

	“Ummmm, Doctor?”Said Clara stunned. 
The Doctor shook his head and said “Rose you sound different, did the smoke...” He stopped talking as he looked up. “Who was this?” thought Clara. She began to look at him closer. He had spiky hair in the front, was wearing a brown trench or overcoat, and he had a completely different voice. Also no bow-tie.

I can't do DAS until I'm 24 now right? or because I passed under the old laws can I still do DAS?

The job is at a restaurant/pub. I've had three ten hour shifts so far and I'm set to do five a week.

[DANNY ROSE:](http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/first-team-profiles/danny-rose/)


Quick, aggressive left-sided player who has developed into a fine left-back after starting out at Spurs as a left winger.

A regular England Under-21 international, Danny featured 11 times in the Premier League for us in 2011-12 - starting three matches - and 20 times in all competitions.

He then took his place in Team GB for the Olympic Games in the summer.

Signed from Leeds in July, 2007, Danny had a spell at Watford before making his Spurs debut in the League Cup win at his home-town team Doncaster in August, 2009.

But Danny will always be remembered for his full debut later that season. Selected for a crucial derby against Arsenal in April, 2010, he delivered with one of the all-time great derby goals, a full volley from fully 35 yards that flew home and saw us on the way to a 2-1 victory over the Gunners and eventually fourth place in the Premier League and Champions League qualification.

Danny played 17 times on loan in the Championship for Bristol City in 2010-11, before starting our final four fixtures in the Premier League.

[BENOIT ASSOU-EKOTTO](http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/first-team-profiles/benoit-assou-ekotto/)

Super-consistent left-back is now regarded as one of the best in his position in the Premier League.
Indeed, only a shoulder injury denied him the chance of an ever-present campaign in the Premier League in 2011-12.

Benoit dislocated his shoulder at QPR in April, 2012 and that meant he missed our last four PL matches, having played in all 34 up to then. He made another six appearances in cup competition.
The Cameroon international added another two goals to his CV as well - including a 30-yard belter against Everton in January, 2012.

Benoit has forged a real understanding with Gareth Bale down the left flank in the last two seasons.
The 2010-11 campaign was another productive one for Benoit, as he played in 45 of our 53 matches. Indeed, he started 45 of our first 48 games before a late hamstring injury ruled him out for the last three weeks of the season and he was our only player to start all 12 matches in the Champions League.

-----------------

Q's:

Is Benny good enough for top 4?

Should he be moved on?

Should we sign someone, or is Danny Rose a good replacement?

Is Rose's aggressive temperament and lack of experience holding him back?

How much of a problem area is LB and how high a priority should a signing be?

------------------

Anyone who says Jan should play LB is a foolish fool from foolton.

EDIT: Zeky Fryers is beyond shit, he barely started for the youth team, and will not, if ever, get 1st team appearances.

It was a great day, with a presentation/discussion mainly on positioning and appropriate gear choices and then the observed ride in a pair before lunch, more observed riding, on-road workshop on riding twisties efficiently and safely, and back to HQ for de-brief and home with a copy of the police handbook for riding.

The observed rides are done in a pair, rider -&gt; police -&gt; rider, switching every now and then with feedback. I went ahead first and wasn't entirely sure what to do with respect to speeding, as the officer told us we should ride how we normally would, or else the day would be pointless. He picked up that I was riding forced, and reassured me he wasn't checking the speedo and neither should I and he didn't care if we sped as long as we weren't riding dangerously and there was no preaching about how I should always strictly obey speed limits.

This week I will share with you all of Frank Lampard's 203 goals for Chelsea, in gif form. 

I know someone started something similar a while ago bu I can't find it thanks to reddit's brillant search function. 

As for the .gifs themselves they are 400 by 300 for the first 100 and 400 by 200 for the remaining 103. I tried my best to keep the size under 5mo per gif, they look smooth enough to me, I hope it will be for you as well. Since I can't use imgur a self-post with the links with RES seems like the best option. 

---

So to start the week, here's all 25 of Frank's goals with his 'weaker' left foot. Inspired by [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1h3qh5/ronaldos_weak_foot/), being able to shoot with both right and left foot is an underrated attribute on which Lampard has worked hard during his career. 

There are some of Frank's finest goals in there, enjoy !

(quick model fact: Kate Moss has been shagging Bobby Gillespie for many, many years - he's probably singing about her on 'Get Your Rocks Off')

Now you.

Welcome back to Picture of the Month, where we showcase some Welsh photos and culture. Here's the plan:

Using the comments section below, submit your photos for Picture of the Month. The photo must be your own work and be your best or favourite representation of Wales and Welsh Culture.

The photo with the most upvotes by **midnight July 7th** gets featured on the sidebar (where you can see last month's winning submission by /u/KaiserMacCleg), until it's time for next month's, in which it will be added to the list of Pictures of the Month to come in the upcoming wikilist shindig.

The submitter also gets **a month of reddit Gold**.

So let's get into the rules:

* This month's theme is **'Garden'**. Be as creative as you want, as long as it ties in with this month's theme!
* Photo submissions must be the root comment in any given comment thread
* It must be your photo. No pilfering photography sites
* It must be 'appropriate'. No hi-res genitalia please.
* It must be at least 300x200 pixels, but the higher the resolution the better! I mean, within reason of course.
* Captions are welcome and encouraged, as they will be included in the 'about' section
* Please be kind and courteous of other users' submissions
* Use your upvotes wisely! The most upvoted submission will most probably be the one we choose, though this is at the discretion of the mods.
* Don't be nasty and downvote images just 'cause they're not yours. That's totally not cool
* This contest will have nothing to do with the upcoming header image photos, more info to come...
* If you suspect foul play feel free to message the moderators!

Changes from last month's competition:

* We're running this for a whole week, so there's plenty of time to get your submissions in. Tell your friends!
* *We have a theme!* This month's theme, again, is 'garden'.

That about sums it up. We look forward to seeing your submissions,
Good luck!

So I did my CBT today, well half of it the radio didn't work for some reason so we had to cut the road bit short. I'm hoping to do full license maybe direct access (I'm 25) somewhen but had some thoughts/questions about costs. Also up to this i've had no experience on a motorbike but picked it up pretty easy. I do a lot of road cycling and I have a full driving license so its really just the controls and weight of the bike cornering which were throwing me off. 

Firstly could I jump straight into a theory + practical test or should I buy/rent a 125cc bike for X months before doing that? Ultimately I want a ninja250/300 doubt anything bigger than that for long for seeable future they look really fun and about as powerful as you realistically need. So I don't really fancy shelling out on a 125 for a short time period. 

Also before doing practical I should buy my own gear I imagine? I know leather top + trousers + gloves + boots + helmet are pretty much needed. But how much should I be looking to spend, prices seem to vary wildly online but seems like you are looking at least £500-600 total for the lot? 

Then obviously there is the cost of the bike tax + insurance? Can anyone say roughly how much insurance is for a ninja250/300. Also should I be looking at used 250R as first bike they seem to be around £3000 or just bite the bullet and shell out for the new 300? Everything I've read says the new 300 is better in almost every way and I don't know the first thing to look at buying used so I'm thinking new might be safer albiet more expensive?

Let's just pressume for a second that Hurt's Doctor isn't a 'Time War Doctor', we've been assuming that the Doctor killed his son/daughter in the time war when he was wiping out the timelords... or at least that's what's hinted. Now think of it this way, the Doctor only took Susan with him when he left Gallifrey... and every time he's gone back to Gallifrey he's never popped back to see his son/daughter, what if the reason the Doctor ran away from Gallifrey was because he killed his son/daughter?

I’m a singer/songwriter from a band in Melbourne, Australia called BETWEEN THE WARS. I’m coming over to the UK in October and I’m looking to play a show on 16th October in Bristol. 

I’ll be playing solo (although our recorded stuff is full-band). Our style is probably best described as folk/punk. Tales of drinking, sailing, love, loss and regret. 
You can hear some stuff from our most recent album on our Australian label’s Bandcamp page: http://slipperyslope.bandcamp.com/album/wont-go-quietly.

Anyway, if you know anyone or have a contact who might be able to help me play a show on 16th October in Bristol, please private message me. 

Thanks heaps and hopefully see you in a couple months!!!

Jay

I'm from Manchester, UK and I used to have a very good friend who lived in up in derry and as some friendships do I let it kind of slip away into nothing which is one of my biggest regrets I have.

I have tried and tried to find her online with her old email address but it's all come to dead ends, everything online seems to end suddenly around a similar date in 2010. I'm incredibly worried about this and has prompted me to make this post.

I'm just trying to find out, firstly if she's OK and if there is anyway I can contact her. If anyone knows her could someone pass this message on to her or just let me know she's OK. 

I'm not sure if I can publish her full name here, so her name is ""Ebby"" and was fair skinned with black hair. If anyone needs me to give any more information just message me.

Thanks, you're my only hope.

I'm starting a blog to raise money for charity, and I need a web developer to help me get the website functioning properly. I have a lot of experience with design so if we work together, I have a feeling we could get this up very quickly and make it very successful. The intention is to raise a lot of money for charity and I'm looking for the right kind of person to help me get the ball rolling. 

This would be an ideal role for someone who wants to flesh out their portfolio. I can't offer you much money until we start getting donations, after which I will pay you in arrears based on a agreed upon sum, but I will pay you whatever money I have now to help me get this started. 

If you would be interested in taking part in this not-for-profit project, message me and I'll forward you some more specific details.

Many Thanks

Sources tell me that the LFC store will soon double the price of letting on the back of the kits. As such, they expect to see a significant increase in income as fans attempt to get kits with some of our new signings' names on the back.

A leaked inventory sheet shows that a kit with ""Papalopashamalamadingdong"" would have cost $275 USD with shipping.

Insiders are brushing it off saying that it is ""simply another method LFC is considering using to raise funds to able to continue to field the most competitive and successful team possible"" noting that ""nothing is set in stone, but fans should see a chance coming soon""

In other news heads have rolled after the signing of Iago Aspas. It seems that a scout's daughter had written a note to her father indicating that she wanted a [Lhasa Apso](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Lhasa_Apso_Puppy_Mochi.jpg/220px-Lhasa_Apso_Puppy_Mochi.jpg) puppy for her birthday. Due to poor handwriting, it was mistaken as instructions to persue Aspas, and the offer was made and accepted before the mistake was realized.

I'm starting a blog to raise money for charity, and I need a web developer to help me get the website functioning properly. I have a lot of experience with design, like Photoshop, Illustrator and Flash, so if we work together, I have a feeling we could get this up very quickly, looking and working well. 

The intention is to raise a lot of money for charity and I'm looking for the right kind of person to help me get the ball rolling.

This would be an ideal role for someone who wants to flesh out their portfolio, do a lot of good (+karma real life) and possibly make a friend = )

I can't offer you much money until I get a job, after which I will pay you in arrears based on a agreed upon sum. However, I endeavour to pay you whatever money I have now to help me get this started. This won't be much since I'm on JSA, but I'm hoping this project will also help me get a job. You can read all about it on the link I posted below.

If you would be interested in taking part in this not-for-profit project, message me and I'll be happy to get in touch. 

You can read about my idea and hence decide whether you'd like to take part by reading my mission statement: http://suhailpatel.co.uk/my-message-to-humanity/

Many thanks for reading!

Alright, let's get going!

Today we have every penalty Frank has ever scored with Chelsea,  all 48 of them. 

This might not be the most spectacular part of the 203 but. Making the gifs made me appreciate the precise routine done over and over again before every penalty, with the success that we know: 48 goals in 55 attempts, a staggering 89% conversion rate.

vs Charlton (between #71 &amp; #72) - No video for this one, it was left out of the Season Review for some reason (maybe Frank deleting the evidence?)

At the moment, I'd like to study a joint honours in Electronic Engineering with Computer Science however one University which I'd like to go to (Manchester) do not offer a course like that.

My question is, do I go for just the Electronic Engineering course or do I go for a course called ""Computer Systems Engineering""? From what I've heard EE covers a wide range of topics including CSE but does not go into as much depth wheras CSE is deeper but only focuses on computers.

For anyone wondering what each course includes, here are their structures:

A little bit about me: Studying a mechatronics course at school and I **really** don't like the mechanics part. I enjoy programming but do not want a course based completely on programming as I enjoy designing circuits and soldering etc...

[If you didn't know:](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/features/home-grown-quota-for-premier-league.html)
&gt;All 20 Clubs must include eight Home Grown players out of a squad of 25 for that Premier League season.

&gt;A Home Grown player will be defined as one who, irrespective of his nationality or age, has been registered with any club affiliated to the Football Association or the Football Association of Wales for a period, continuous or not, of three entire seasons or 36 months prior to his 21st birthday (or the end of the season during which he turns 21).

&gt;Clubs are able to supplement their squads with unlimited additional players under the age of 21 on 1st January in the year in which the season commences.

Another way to think about it is that we are only allowed 17 players that are not home-gown, since if you don't have those 8, then it takes away from your total 25.  So with that in mind here's how it looks:

http://i.imgur.com/8lPfITK.png?1

As you can see as it currently stands we have 16 players in the squad who are not trained in nation, leaving just one spot available unless we got rid of someone.

Lukaku, Piazon, and Wallace would not count in the squad because they are still under 21. Lukaku will become trained in nation for the start of next season, and Piazon in January of 2015 due to his spell with Malaga.  If we loan Piazon to a non-English club for more than 6 months, he can no longer be trained in nation.  Also if we don't loan him at all, he could be trained in club (more on that later).

Unless one of McEachran, Kakuta, Hutchinson, or van Aanholt join the squad, we would go into this coming season with 6 trained in nation players, meaning a total squad of 23 if we added one non-trained in nation player.

UEFA also requires that we have 8 players trained in nation, but 4 of those also have to be trained at your specific club.  It also requires U21 players to have been at the club for at least 2 seasons for them to not count against the squad total (so for instance Wallace would not count as U21).  This makes things even trickier for us as only Terry, McEachran, and Hutchinson are over 21 and trained at our club.

So with all that bit of structured rambling said, keep it in mind when thinking about future transfers.  As it stands we only have room for one over 21 international, but 2 trained in England players.",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,Analyzing the makeup of our current squad,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1hijiz/analyzing_the_makeup_of_our_current_squad/

Basically I've wanted to start riding for a few years but never had the money to do so, well now I sort of have the money and I want to start on the road to riding. I've had a full car licence (B1, B) since I was 17.

A guy at work has just got a ZXR400 which is a bit beat up and needs a bit of work done which he's hoping to carry out in the next year and then sell on, so that's where I come in, in a year or so I wouldn't mind maybe buying this off of him. But before I do I think it would be best for me to get a smaller bike to ride and get used to before jumping up to a 400?


How do I go about doing this? Do I do my CBT now to get an A1, then buy myself a 125cc for a year or so before taking my test for an A licence? 



Sorry for the wall of text, I'm really confused, I sort of know what I want but have no idea how to get there, as you can see.

Not to say this one is, but it's a little unique in that I don't think 'Oh Cecilia' has ever been used for a player's song,  and even has that sort of samba-ish beat to it. And there are moments in the song where the fans at all ends can hold notes and have a good time of it. 

Was thinking this: To the tune of Cecilia by Simon and Garfunkel:

Coutiiinho, you're breaking Blue hearts, you're shaking their confidence daily. Oh Coutiiiiiiiiiinho, they're down on their knees, they're begging you please, just don't pass.

Coutiiiinho, you're breaking﻿ Manc hearts, you're shaking their confidence daily. Oh Coutiiiiiiiinho, up and down An-field, we're begging you please, ne-ver stop.

Ne-ver stop

Watching you in the afternoon, Oh Coutinho
Home or a-wa-ay    (watching you)
We stood up to cheer you on
When we saw how you passed
Thank you Inter Milan

Coutiiinho, you also score goals, still shaking their confidence daily. Oh Coutiiiiiinho, with your magic feet, from a Rio street...welcome home. 

Welcome HOME...

Oh Oh Ohhh Oh Oh Oh Oh Ohhh OH OH OH OH OH

He even has hair like Garfunkel. Or did, until we saw him at Fulham, when he got rid of those curls...for now.

I think how well KDB adapts to the premier league will be quite an important factor, as him playing well will provide a good alternative for when we bench one of Mazacar (the same applies to Schurrle). 

I think the super cup might play a more important role than people anticipate. I can see that if we get stomped on by Bayern, it will really set us back in our important opening campaign (as well as the opposite).

On November 23, 1963, Doctor Who aired with the episode An Unearthly Child. The first episode introduced audiences to the mysterious character who called himself “The Doctor.” His granddaughter Susan, attended Coal Hill School where she excelled (most notably History). Her teachers became suspicious of this young girl and wondered about her home life. One day after school, Barbara Wright and Ian Chesterton followed Susan home and saw she vanished in a junkyard. They follow her and find themselves in the TARDIS. The Doctor, showing a pompous attitude, is hesitant to let them in and prefers to be alone, as he doesn’t like to meddle with the affairs of Earth. This first episode kicks off the show and to everyones dismay, continued for 26 seasons.

In the series 7 finale of Doctor Who, John Hurt is introduced as the Doctor. Who is this mysterious man? It can be assumed that he is a previous incarnation of the Doctor, an unknown Doctor. Since the show returned in 2005, there have been no mention of this Doctor and suddenly, this new doctor appears? One from the past? Moffat has become arrogant with his writing. He has begun to take the shows lore and adapted it to his own will. Clearly, everything about the Doctor, his race, his planet, and his past have all been present from the beginning! Why would Moffat dare adapt the show to his liking?

Right? Wrong.

During William Hartnell’s run, it was unknown where the Doctor originated from. It was unknown what his race was called and it was unknown as to why he was in 1963 London in the very first episode. At the end of season 2, the Doctor met someone from his home planet in The Time Meddler. This was the first time the Doctors origins were touched upon. However, it wouldn’t be until The War Games that the Doctor’s race was named.

At the beginning of Season 3, the Doctor changed his face after defeating the Cybermen for the first time in The Tenth Planet. This was a big leap of faith by the development team. Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis had no right giving the Doctor the ability to change his face. But they did, and it moved the show forward.

At the end of season 6, the Doctor’s race was named. They were called “The TimeLords.” During the conclusion of the epic 10 part story of The War Games, the Time Lords banish The Doctor from his home planet and force him to change his face. It wasn’t until the end of the Third Doctor’s run that “regeneration” was said and coined. Earlier that season during the story The Time Warrior, the Doctor’s home planet was named as Gallifrey. This occurred 11 seasons after the beginning of the show. Robert Holmes moved the show forward.

After the show was cancelled, it went off the air for 15 years. When the Doctor returned in 2005, there was a Time War that wiped out the Time Lords and the Daleks, leaving The Doctor to be the last of his kind. The space of what occurred between his Eighth and Ninth Incarnation are unknown. Russell T. Davies moved the show forward.

When Doctor Who began, it was meant to be an education show for kids, showing historical events in a fun creative way. All of the major changes and additions to the mythos of the “Whoniverse” have moved the show forward. 

Steven Moffat, an avid Doctor Who fan all his life, shows nothing but love for the show. He’s essentially living out every fan fiction writers dream. These new ideas have been in his head for years and years and he can make them a reality.

The point is, change is good. This show is about change. Moffat, himself, said he was moving the show forward. Revealing a lost incarnation of the Doctor is moving the show forward, whether you like it or not. This is going to be a key event in 50 years.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,How Moffat Ruined Doctor Who,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1hji1a/how_moffat_ruined_doctor_who/

I was just going through my UJM application history and noticed something odd. I have applied for 76 jobs using the UJM system, only eight of my applications have actually been viewed by the employer advertising the job. That works out to be something like 89.5% of my applications have gone unnoticed.

So my question is, have you found work using this system? I personally think it is useless and I have much better results using other job sites, but I have to use UJM to keep the job centre happy and I feel like it is a waste of time which I could be using looking for jobs elsewhere.

I was intrigued by this, and someone else's comment to 'throw the ticket away as it was a scam', and I found this thread:

It's interesting to see that it is, indeed, a load of rubbish. So, for future reference, if you get a parking ticket from UK Parking Control LTD, chuck it in the bin, ignore all correspondance, and *do not* reply to the letters.

Just a little heads up.

Disclaimer: I will not park on the curbs any longer as there is parking just a 10 minute walk away and I respect the landlord's decisions, and nobody else will either - not for fear of parking tickets, but out of respect for the company. I just wanted to make it clear that I'm not a douchebag and I had no intention of just ignoring it and continuing to park on the curbs, as, well, obviously that's a douchebag move.

I live in Norway, and had my computer sent for repair in the UK.  I know the package I shipped was well packed (bubble wrap etc), and the box that I got back had no damage.

Unfortunately it appears that the computer has damage on the top corner, exactly like it had been dropped.

The company is not responding to my emails asking for information on what happened, and since I do not live in the UK I do not know what I can do.

I wanted to ask if anyone had any advice on how I can proceed?  Is there a way to file a claim against the company?

In the end, with shipping and the service, it comes to a good amount of money that was all for nothing (the reason the computer was sent for repair was not fixed either).

Hey there LawAbidingCriminaI

Thanks for dropping off the post. Appreciated.

I hear what you're saying mate and don't lose any sleep over it.
Glad you refused to pay them for the bank thing and i don't need any tenancy agreement changing just so they can rip us all off even more.
Keep that £150 and whatever else they would try to extract from you and see it as a kind of wedding present from me ! hahaha
Mate, you seem genuine and as long as I get paid every month, then we're cool.

To be honest, it would have been good to meet you face to face to discuss a few things because i've also been very unhappy with the service from the letting agents.
Do you know they take 11% of your rent every month and then another 20% for tax. It doesn't actually leave me with much... 

Anyway, it's gone midnight so turning off for the night.
Don't worry about the rent date or changing contract or anything and there's no problems at all for me if its a few days late or if your fiancee is living with you.
Hope to meet you both anyway.

Not passing through HK are you by any chance on the way to Korea ?

Cheers

Hello again!

Today we have the 14 goals scored by Lampard with his head. 

Frank is relatively tall at 1m84 but his reputation wasn't made on aerial skills. Still, with his fantastic sense of placement (more on that tomorrow), Lampard has been able to finish a few goals with his head, especially since a certain spanish wizard joined the club. 

Some wonderful crosses all around:

Whenever criticism is levelled against the USA on Reddit, the most upvoted comments are those defending America. Just below that is a layer of people lamenting the (often nonexistent) anti-American 'circlejerk', and below that will be a smorgasbord of explanations as to why America was right all along. There's rarely any acceptance that the USA may have got something 'wrong'.

It seems like we're more ready to accept our nation's wrongdoing than our American cousins are. Is that true? Are we actually more critical of our own nation's chequered track record? What has the UK done wrong in the 20th Century and maybe even before it was the United Kingdom? What are our equivalents of Iran Air flight 655, and have we come to terms with how wrong they were?

Reddit's obviously going to sway things, but I think we largely accept the moral question marks over the Dresden bombings, 'scorched earth' in the Boer War, British troops' actions in Northern Ireland...

We should not be so quick to let people take our rights away, especially for such pathetic reasons.

If the draconian measure of prohibition actually worked it would still be a questionable thing to do - but it doesn't work.

Virtually anyone who isn't in the business of trying to get elected (and who is vaguely aware of current events) now recognises prohibition and criminalisation are a failed policy.

More class war from the Tories and I'm bloody pissed off.

I'm naturally a big Clint Dempsey fan and being of Welsh ancestry I also took to Gareth Bale just in time to watch him become one of the best players in the world (and hopefully he's still there in August!). It took me a while to find a PL team I could identify with but I can finally say I consider myself a Spurs fan and seeing them in person would surely solidify that.

Problem is that I've been told Tottenham tickets are notoriously difficult to get, and the two matches I could attend -- the 17th at Crystal Palace and the 24th with Swansea -- are both team's home openers which will just make it worse. The Palace match would work better with my schedule but that means trying to get away seats (which is fine as I love traveling for Timbers games and I don't really care where I see them) but it requires you be a season ticket holder or a paid member just to apply. And I don't even want to think about trying to get tickets to the first game of the season at White Hart Lane.

Can anyone offer some advice or assistance on getting tickets? Is there any way I could get away tickets to Palace without being a member? Or if Palace will be impossible, how might I get into the home opener on the 24th? I understand they have a partnership with Stubhub but should I expect to find tickets there at non-extortive prices?


If anyone's ever in Portland, I'm a Timbers Army season ticket holder and can usually track down some extra tickets. Our games are always sold out and the atmosphere is second to none in MLS.

Thanks in advance. Hope to see your fine club next month!",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,Ticketing help for a visiting American?,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1hku8w/ticketing_help_for_a_visiting_american/

I'm coming to University of Leeds this September and need help with finding a good accommodation nearby. The University's options are quite steep and the difference between them and outside accommodation is nearly half.
