I don't have any experience of Welsh people or Wales, but I've lived in all the other three countries. Northern Irish people will identify as British (if theyre on that side), Scottish people (in general) won't (pro-independent Scotland or not, most identify as 'Scottish' right away), and English people identify as either English or British. But I've noticed, English people often use 'British' to refer to just England, or when talking about things 'in the UK' will then give exclusively England-based examples; or slip into using 'the UK' and 'England' interchangeably.

I wonder if it comes from education. Anyway it still surprises me how little English people (based on my experiences) seem to know about the cultures of NI, Scotland and Wales and how their perspectives on things are often a bit different. I do think that strongly nationalist perspectives aren't helped by a lack of integrated history education, for example. A lot of my nationalist friends (from various countries) I think are more so because theyve always had quite an isolationist view of their country's history...anyway. Rambling a bit perhaps.

  Short story: We bought a house down here in Surrey. It's nice enough, and the areas ok but there's virtually nothing to do down here that isn't a 10-15 minute drive away, and the pubs around here are shite (both of them) which means we would either have to drive to one (ruling out both of us having a pint) or suffer South London public transport just to go for a nice pint.  
  
  We're in a bit of a quandry - been here for a few years now and have not really met anyone; it's quite insular and I'm getting quite bored of it. Not got much in the way of hobbies these days other than drinking wine and playing computer games (often at the same time) and cooking, which aren't really hobbies that get you out and about meeting people. I looked into joining my local shooting club because guns are cool but the waiting list *just for approval of membership* is a minimum of 8 months, more if they are fully booked; spoke to a chap there and yeah, they're fully booked. So, that's a non-starter for the next year or so while I presumably wait for someone move out of the area or whatever. Reading, I quite like too, but I'm not the sort of person to go to a reading circle and be forced to read the Hobbit and then talk about it. I did a degree in English; I've quite literally had enough of talking about books.

The reason for this is because within many different forms of media about Doctor Who which has contradictions that range from big to small. For example, in NA: Lungbarrow, it was stated that the Doctor took the TARDIS on his own and had traveled to Gallifrey's past which is where he found Susan (who is the granddaughter of  the Other) and had taken her with him. However, in CC: The Beginning and TV: The Name of the Doctor, it is shown that he left with Susan. You see, in Lawrence Miles' EDA: Interference and NA: Dead Romance, it explained that the bottle in in the EDAs contained the NA universe. Also, in NA: Christmas on a Rational Planet, a bottle was found that had contained a universe that was similar to the TV Movie which some have theorized that it contained the EDA universe. So it was like the Farnsworth Parabox theory from Futurama where one box contained another universe and in that universe, there was another box that contained the other. So if one who was from the EDA universe were to go into the bottle that contained the NA universe, they would end up coming out of the bottle that contained the EDA universe and vice versa. So there is the NA universe, the EDA universe, the DWM universe, the Big Finish universe, and more. It was also explained that the reason why references to the NAs were made in the EDAs were because one of the bottles had a few cracks in it and some events had bled through. What if other bottles exist that contain the other universes? What if the Romana played by Juliet Landau was actually not a future incarnation of the Romana that exists in the Big Finish universe but a Romana that exists in a different universe such as the NA universe who had somehow found her way through the BF universe? What if the Master played by Alex Macqueen is the same way as well. What if the Faction Paradox, instead of being erased in the EDA universe, had somehow escaped into the NA universe with the use of the bottle? Or maybe there are alternate versions of them that reside in the NA universe. It is possible that they had indeed escaped (or at least some of them) because in NA: Dead Romance, it was implied that the one-armed man was actually Father Kreiner. What if the Faction Paradox novels and audios take place in a possible future of the NA universe? It is possible that references to the NAs in the BF audios could be the same reason for the references to the NAs in the EDAs. The Classic Series serves as a basis for all these universes but they all diverge at certain points. For example, Ace was killed in DWM: Ground Zero when in fact a much older Ace was very much alive in the NAs. Maybe the BF universe and the Revived Series universe were not always one. Maybe the bottle containing the BF universe that resided in the Revived Series universe had broken and instead of being destroyed, had instead merged with the other universe. Either that or there are much larger cracks on the bottle containing the BF universe that resides in the Revived Series universe.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,The Bottle Universe Theory,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1vr7c8/the_bottle_universe_theory/

For example Barcelona have the youth teams playing tiki-taka football which means that when they go to the first team there is less of an adapting period to get used to the style.

As is said i am in a fortunate situation and have the option to not take out any student loans. However just because i don't have to doesn't mean its the best financial decision for my parents (It wouldn't be a burden to them, my school fees are ~£12k per year ATM)

I am trying to calculate if it is worthwhile taking out the student loans for my course (3 years) opposed to not taking them out at all and paying in full. However if i do take out the loans my parents would put the ~£36K into the market, hoping to beat the interest on the loans. 

The question i want to ask is that is it worthwhile taking the loans out, as presuming you earn £25K start salary, increasing 2% plus inflation i/they would end up paying an extra £15K in interest over 23 years or so.  

I am confused as to take out the loans or not, i will not be paying for them my parents will, what is the best way to do this.

If Pompeii is a fixed point in time, then how does time in the Doctor Who universe deal with this? Would it find some other way to blow the Pryovile energy converter? Or would it stop the Pyrovile crashing altogether which would let the erruption of Pompeii carry on unabated?

I think this wa just a matter of time. I've seen it in the videos, there is a stratification dividing the Spanish and British players. And everyone who knows something about group dynamics, knows that this can't be sustained over time. If there are strong personalities in either groups there will inevitably be clinches.In hindsight I think it was a mistake to bring in so many Spaniards, bearing in mind how easy it is to get lazy with learning a new language and socialize with others. Angel Rangel did well, but he has a completely different mindset and realized this early on, even settling in Wales and has a Welsh wife if I'm not mistaking. Keep in mind he arrived at a time when a transformation was absolutely required of him (only a few Spaniards there at the time).We all know how challenging group dynamics can be. At the start everything is working great and you are untouchable as a team, but as time goes, these strong personalities are shining through. One person can be dealt with, but when there is a group of people supporting this person, you are forced to choose a side. For the Spaniards, this is either Swansea City or Chico Flores.In reality there are two options in my opinion:1.Chico Flores must go2.Michael Laudrup must goThe latter can be explained by the fact that he doesn't possess the leadership authority which is required in such conditions (this would never have happened under the likes of SAF). As much as I hate to suggest that one of our legends has to go, I think it's the best thing for our beloved club.Options, perspectives, suggestions?",false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,null,null,self,A psychological perspective on what's going on at the Swansea City camp,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/swanseacity/comments/1vr9cy/a_psychological_perspective_on_whats_going_on_at/

##Loans

**Suso at Almeria** -- As predicted, Suso had a major chance to impress in his favoured position of attacking midfield as Almeria met Racing in a home Copa del Rey second leg tie. Suso played 90 minutes in the game, of which Almeria unfortunately lost 2-0. A poor result, albeit against a better team, but Suso will be disappointed the not having made more of an impact. As of now, his best position looks out on the right wing where it is less likely he will doubled up on.  
Despite having played a major part in the recent Copa games Suso is still unfavoured in terms of a starting La Liga place. Although, he is beginning to weed his way back into contention. This time with an appearance in Almeria's tough game away to a in-form Villarreal, Suso came on at half time with the score 1-0 to the home side but wasn't able to make a significant impact as they lost 2-0.

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Coady was disappointingly dropped to the bench for Sheffield United's home game vs Bradford, and was only able to make a very late substitute appearance. Although, it's disappointing to see Coady dropped, it proved an effective change as Sheffield drew 2-2 after two poor loses.

**Krisztián Adorján at Groningen** -- Adorjan and Groningen finally returned to action after their winter break as they drew 1-1 away to Waalwijk. Adorjan played a important role in attacking midfield, although he was sacrificed for defender Lorenzo Burnet when Groningen went down to 10 men. Leading at the time of this substitution, the man advantage helped Waalwijk as they grabbed a late equaliser.

**Pepe Reina at Napoli** -- Reina was absent again, through recovering from injury, as Napoli drew disappointingly with Bolonga due to a last minute equaliser. The game saw Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon give Napoli the lead after previously being 1-0 down. However, Ronlando Bianchi's literal last kick of the game goal, for then 10 men Bolonga, saw Napoli chance of the Scudetto slip further away.

**Jack Robinson at Blackpool** -- Robinson came up against Barnsley are their new addition in Ryan McLaughlin as Blackpool recorded their 4th consecutive loss. Again, there's little I can say about Blackpool. They show no sign of improving, and with questions of manager Paul Ince's future there could be further turmoil.

**Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City** -- Assaidi returned to Stoke's line up as they met bottom placed Crystal Palace. An easy fixture on paper, but Palace were determined and superb. With Assaidi coming off at the 70th minute, he wasn't able to perform to the level he was prior to a few weeks ago, and Stoke ultimately lost the game 1-0.

**Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC** -- Borini was pivotal to Sunderland turning around a tough game to Southampton. The in-form southerners were 2-0 up when [Borini got his sliced goal](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/fan_shot_images/317665/iCFvMYz54FJyv.gif). Borini continued to play well and Sunderland bagged a equaliser in the second half. They even continued to push on and looked close to getting a winner, with Borini scoring another only for it to be ruled out for offside.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Derby got back to winning ways with a tight 1-0 win against Brighton, Wisdom as always starting at right back. However, Wisdom was taken off prior to the goal in the close affair; being taken off for striker Conor Sammon, with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford getting the winner.

**Craig Roddan at Accrington Stanley** -- Roddan wasn't part of Accrington's squad for their 2-1 win against Cheltenham.

**Ryan Mclaughlin at Barnsley** -- Ryan McLaughlin made his Barnsley début directly against fellow Liverpool counterpart Jack Robinson. The right back displayed a number of his skills, highlighting his pace, ability to beat a player and passing ability numerous times. In what is certainly a impressive start, it's good to see McLaughlin finally getting a great chance at senior football after failing to push through to the first team. [\[Individual highlights of McLaughlin here\]](http://t.co/iupeALveRq)

**Tiago Ilori at Granada** -- Ilori recently finalised a move to 11th placed La Liga side Granada. With comments from Rodgers coming to light, it is evident a loan move in January has been in the pipe line for a while. Again, it's great to see us utilising the loan system, especially using clubs in Spain; playing against the very best is a priceless learning experience.

##The academy:

**Liverpool U21s** -- The U21s returned to attack after a prolonged winter break with a very tough match away to a strong Arsenal side consisting of the likes of Frimpong, Jenkinson and Oxlade-Chamberlain. Unfortunately, the game wasn't televised, so I haven't been able to see the goals but I do know Ngoo (2), Smith and Peterson were the scorers.

**Liverpool U18s** -- A U18 side, that was absent from such talents like Sinclair and Chirivella through injury, met Aston Villa at Langtree Park in the FA Youth cup 4th round. Due to this Sergi Canos was called upon to lead the line, with Ojo, Kent and Trickett-Smith behind. U21 pairing Brannagan and Rossiter sat deepest in midfield.  
Liverpool started well, Trickett-Smith and Kent having early opportunities from outside the box. Liverpool made the breakthrough, from a similar chance, too in the 19th minute. Ojo's cross field run broke to Maguire, who pushed forward from left back. He chipped a ball back to Trickett-Smith who took and score a sublime half volley. Soon after, however, Villa were level. They pushed forward on the counter attack and a simple ball into the box caused more problems than it should have. With neither Williams or Randall able to clear, Villa's striker McKirdy poked it in. Villa were on the forefront now, with Ojo giving away a poor pass in his own half, Crump was the only thing stopping McKirdy from making it 2-1 to the away side.  
Wilson replaced Ojo at half time, the Englishman not having the best half all around. Wilson was soon into action, winning a free kick 10 yards outside the area. Although, his attempt floated a yard or so over the bar. Villa were still in this, no doubt about it, and they emphasised that when Jordan Rossiter was forced to clear a header off the line. However, from that clearance Liverpool were able to counter, and it was Harry Wilson at the forefront of the counter attack. After a series of short passes Kent drove down the right and delivered Wilson with the ball. Although Canos and Trickett-Smith were open in the area, Wilson only had one thought in his mind. He cut onto his left foot and placed the ball into the bottom left corner. Liverpool regained the lead.  
Liverpool finished the tie off superbly, with what was Ryan Kent's second assist and Harry Wilson's second goal of the game. Maguire pressurised down the left hand side forcing the ball the break the Ryan Kent. Kent did brilliantly to beat two men, and shake off a third. Next, he played a inch perfect through ball to find Wilson. From that point on, the rest was a given. Wilson left two Villa players on their arses and again slotted into the bottom left corner. [\[GIF of Wilson's second goal here\]](http://gfycat.com/WelloffSardonicAlaskanhusky)  
Wilson almost finished off his hat trick when Kent, again, got it to him. However, his right footed shot was saved well. Final score, 3-1 Liverpool. [\[Highlights of the game here\]](http://vimeo.com/84277984#at=0)  

The U18s were soon back in action, with a 5-0 win away to Blackpool. Unfortunately, this was not televised, but I know the scorers were Harry Wilson, Sergi Canos, Dan Cleary and Sheyi Ojo (2). Nice to see Ojo bouncing back after what was a disappointing display in the Youth Cup.

The U18s were soon back in action, with a 5-0 win away to Blackpool. Unfortunately, this was not televised, but I know the scorers were Harry Wilson, Sergi Canos, Dan Cleary and Sheyi Ojo (2). Nice to see Ojo bouncing back after what was a disappointing display in the Youth Cup.

##Loans

**Suso at Almeria** -- As predicted, Suso had a major chance to impress in his favoured position of attacking midfield as Almeria met Racing in a home Copa del Rey second leg tie. Suso played 90 minutes in the game, of which Almeria unfortunately lost 2-0. A poor result, albeit against a better team, but Suso will be disappointed the not having made more of an impact. As of now, his best position looks out on the right wing where it is less likely he will doubled up on.  
Despite having played a major part in the recent Copa games Suso is still unfavoured in terms of a starting La Liga place. Although, he is beginning to weed his way back into contention. This time with an appearance in Almeria's tough game away to a in-form Villarreal, Suso came on at half time with the score 1-0 to the home side but wasn't able to make a significant impact as they lost 2-0.

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Coady was disappointingly dropped to the bench for Sheffield United's home game vs Bradford, and was only able to make a very late substitute appearance. Although, it's disappointing to see Coady dropped, it proved an effective change as Sheffield drew 2-2 after two poor loses.

**Krisztián Adorján at Groningen** -- Adorjan and Groningen finally returned to action after their winter break as they drew 1-1 away to Waalwijk. Adorjan played a important role in attacking midfield, although he was sacrificed for defender Lorenzo Burnet when Groningen went down to 10 men. Leading at the time of this substitution, the man advantage helped Waalwijk as they grabbed a late equaliser.

**Pepe Reina at Napoli** -- Reina was absent again, through recovering from injury, as Napoli drew disappointingly with Bolonga due to a last minute equaliser. The game saw Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon give Napoli the lead after previously being 1-0 down. However, Ronlando Bianchi's literal last kick of the game goal, for then 10 men Bolonga, saw Napoli chance of the Scudetto slip further away.

**Jack Robinson at Blackpool** -- Robinson came up against Barnsley are their new addition in Ryan McLaughlin as Blackpool recorded their 4th consecutive loss. Again, there's little I can say about Blackpool. They show no sign of improving, and with questions of manager Paul Ince's future there could be further turmoil.

**Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City** -- Assaidi returned to Stoke's line up as they met bottom placed Crystal Palace. An easy fixture on paper, but Palace were determined and superb. With Assaidi coming off at the 70th minute, he wasn't able to perform to the level he was prior to a few weeks ago, and Stoke ultimately lost the game 1-0.

**Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC** -- Borini was pivotal to Sunderland turning around a tough game to Southampton. The in-form southerners were 2-0 up when [Borini got his sliced goal](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/fan_shot_images/317665/iCFvMYz54FJyv.gif). Borini continued to play well and Sunderland bagged a equaliser in the second half. They even continued to push on and looked close to getting a winner, with Borini scoring another only for it to be ruled out for offside.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Derby got back to winning ways with a tight 1-0 win against Brighton, Wisdom as always starting at right back. However, Wisdom was taken off prior to the goal in the close affair; being taken off for striker Conor Sammon, with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford getting the winner.

**Craig Roddan at Accrington Stanley** -- Roddan wasn't part of Accrington's squad for their 2-1 win against Cheltenham.

**Ryan Mclaughlin at Barnsley** -- Ryan McLaughlin made his Barnsley début directly against fellow Liverpool counterpart Jack Robinson. The right back displayed a number of his skills, highlighting his pace, ability to beat a player and passing ability numerous times. In what is certainly a impressive start, it's good to see McLaughlin finally getting a great chance at senior football after failing to push through to the first team. [\[Individual highlights of McLaughlin here\]](http://t.co/iupeALveRq)

**Tiago Ilori at Granada** -- Ilori recently finalised a move to 11th placed La Liga side Granada. With comments from Rodgers coming to light, it is evident a loan move in January has been in the pipe line for a while. Again, it's great to see us utilising the loan system, especially using clubs in Spain; playing against the very best is a priceless learning experience.
*****
##The academy:

**Liverpool U21s** -- The U21s returned to attack after a prolonged winter break with a very tough match away to a strong Arsenal side consisting of the likes of Frimpong, Jenkinson and Oxlade-Chamberlain. Unfortunately, the game wasn't televised, so I haven't been able to see the goals but I do know Ngoo (2), Smith and Peterson were the scorers.

**Liverpool U18s** -- A U18 side, that was absent from such talents like Sinclair and Chirivella through injury, met Aston Villa at Langtree Park in the FA Youth cup 4th round. Due to this Sergi Canos was called upon to lead the line, with Ojo, Kent and Trickett-Smith behind. U21 pairing Brannagan and Rossiter sat deepest in midfield.  
Liverpool started well, Trickett-Smith and Kent having early opportunities from outside the box. Liverpool made the breakthrough, from a similar chance, too in the 19th minute. Ojo's cross field run broke to Maguire, who pushed forward from left back. He chipped a ball back to Trickett-Smith who took and score a sublime half volley. Soon after, however, Villa were level. They pushed forward on the counter attack and a simple ball into the box caused more problems than it should have. With neither Williams or Randall able to clear, Villa's striker McKirdy poked it in. Villa were on the forefront now, with Ojo giving away a poor pass in his own half, Crump was the only thing stopping McKirdy from making it 2-1 to the away side.  
Wilson replaced Ojo at half time, the Englishman not having the best half all around. Wilson was soon into action, winning a free kick 10 yards outside the area. Although, his attempt floated a yard or so over the bar. Villa were still in this, no doubt about it, and they emphasised that when Jordan Rossiter was forced to clear a header off the line. However, from that clearance Liverpool were able to counter, and it was Harry Wilson at the forefront of the counter attack. After a series of short passes Kent drove down the right and delivered Wilson with the ball. Although Canos and Trickett-Smith were open in the area, Wilson only had one thought in his mind. He cut onto his left foot and placed the ball into the bottom left corner. Liverpool regained the lead.  
Liverpool finished the tie off superbly, with what was Ryan Kent's second assist and Harry Wilson's second goal of the game. Maguire pressurised down the left hand side forcing the ball the break the Ryan Kent. Kent did brilliantly to beat two men, and shake off a third. Next, he played a inch perfect through ball to find Wilson. From that point on, the rest was a given. Wilson left two Villa players on their arses and again slotted into the bottom left corner. [\[GIF of Wilson's second goal here\]](http://gfycat.com/WelloffSardonicAlaskanhusky)  
Wilson almost finished off his hat trick when Kent, again, got it to him. However, his right footed shot was saved well. Final score, 3-1 Liverpool. [\[Highlights of the 3-1 win here\]](http://vimeo.com/84277984#at=0)  

The U18s were soon back in action, with a 5-0 win away to Blackburn. In a game where Neil Critchley made a surprising 9 changes, with only Sheyi Ojo and Sergi Canos retaining their starting places from mid-week.  
Liverpool were off to a flyer when Wilson played a lovely one-two with Sergi Canos, although his shot was saved well. Liverpool continued to play well, and made the breakthrough in the 10th minute with Sergi Canos intercepting the ball, playing in Ojo who smashed the ball into the top left corner with his left foot. Blackburn responded well, earning a free kick which resulted in a shot Firth was forced to save.  
Ojo drove forward down the left hand side, continued to look like Liverpool's biggest threat and won a corner. It was from that resulting corner of which Liverpool went 2-0 up. Marsh delivered a curling corner and Cleary finished it with a well placed header. Soon after, Blackburn's Jack Doyle was fortunate to not be sent off for a potentially leg breaking tackle. Liverpool didn't let this deter them. Ojo, again, driving forward down the left delivered a great ball to Canos who placed the ball in to make it 3-0. Liverpool were in full stride now, with left back Sam Hart striding forward, he opened up play. Eventually, the ball came to Wilson on the left, and as he beat his made and drove into the box he was fouled and won a penalty. Wilson slotted his penalty in to again score. Half time and it was 4-0 to Liverpool.  
Liverpool got their 5th before have time when Ojo was set clean through. He slotted past the 'keeper to further extend the lead. Blackburn looked more threatening, forcing Firth into making of impressive saves. Liverpool held on to their clean sheet to complete a superb performance. What was most impressive, was Ojo's performance. He bounced back extremely well after a poor spell midweek. Wilson continued to look much better than his age suggests, such an impressive talent. Canos seems to be settling in well, taking the chance of Sinclair's absence by the horns. Final score, 5-0 Liverpool.

##Loans

**Suso at Almeria** -- As predicted, Suso had a major chance to impress in his favoured position of attacking midfield as Almeria met Racing in a home Copa del Rey second leg tie. Suso played 90 minutes in the game, of which Almeria unfortunately lost 2-0. A poor result, albeit against a better team, but Suso will be disappointed the not having made more of an impact. As of now, his best position looks out on the right wing where it is less likely he will doubled up on.  
Despite having played a major part in the recent Copa games Suso is still unfavoured in terms of a starting La Liga place. Although, he is beginning to weed his way back into contention. This time with an appearance in Almeria's tough game away to a in-form Villarreal, Suso came on at half time with the score 1-0 to the home side but wasn't able to make a significant impact as they lost 2-0.

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Coady was disappointingly dropped to the bench for Sheffield United's home game vs Bradford, and was only able to make a very late substitute appearance. Although, it's disappointing to see Coady dropped, it proved an effective change as Sheffield drew 2-2 after two poor loses.

**Krisztián Adorján at Groningen** -- Adorjan and Groningen finally returned to action after their winter break as they drew 1-1 away to Waalwijk. Adorjan played a important role in attacking midfield, although he was sacrificed for defender Lorenzo Burnet when Groningen went down to 10 men. Leading at the time of this substitution, the man advantage helped Waalwijk as they grabbed a late equaliser.

**Pepe Reina at Napoli** -- Reina was absent again, through recovering from injury, as Napoli drew disappointingly with Bolonga due to a last minute equaliser. The game saw Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon give Napoli the lead after previously being 1-0 down. However, Ronlando Bianchi's literal last kick of the game goal, for then 10 men Bolonga, saw Napoli chance of the Scudetto slip further away.

**Jack Robinson at Blackpool** -- Robinson came up against Barnsley are their new addition in Ryan McLaughlin as Blackpool recorded their 4th consecutive loss. Again, there's little I can say about Blackpool. They show no sign of improving, and with questions of manager Paul Ince's future there could be further turmoil.

**Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City** -- Assaidi returned to Stoke's line up as they met bottom placed Crystal Palace. An easy fixture on paper, but Palace were determined and superb. With Assaidi coming off at the 70th minute, he wasn't able to perform to the level he was prior to a few weeks ago, and Stoke ultimately lost the game 1-0.

**Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC** -- Borini was pivotal to Sunderland turning around a tough game to Southampton. The in-form southerners were 2-0 up when [Borini got his sliced goal](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/fan_shot_images/317665/iCFvMYz54FJyv.gif). Borini continued to play well and Sunderland bagged a equaliser in the second half. They even continued to push on and looked close to getting a winner, with Borini scoring another only for it to be ruled out for offside.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Derby got back to winning ways with a tight 1-0 win against Brighton, Wisdom as always starting at right back. However, Wisdom was taken off prior to the goal in the close affair; being taken off for striker Conor Sammon, with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford getting the winner.

**Craig Roddan at Accrington Stanley** -- Roddan wasn't part of Accrington's squad for their 2-1 win against Cheltenham.

**Ryan Mclaughlin at Barnsley** -- Ryan McLaughlin made his Barnsley début directly against fellow Liverpool counterpart Jack Robinson. The right back displayed a number of his skills, highlighting his pace, ability to beat a player and passing ability numerous times. In what is certainly a impressive start, it's good to see McLaughlin finally getting a great chance at senior football after failing to push through to the first team. [\[Individual highlights of McLaughlin here\]](http://t.co/iupeALveRq)

**Tiago Ilori at Granada** -- Ilori recently finalised a move to 11th placed La Liga side Granada. With comments from Rodgers coming to light, it is evident a loan move in January has been in the pipe line for a while. Again, it's great to see us utilising the loan system, especially using clubs in Spain; playing against the very best is a priceless learning experience.

##The academy:

**Liverpool U21s** -- The U21s returned to attack after a prolonged winter break with a very tough match away to a strong Arsenal side consisting of the likes of Frimpong, Jenkinson and Oxlade-Chamberlain. Unfortunately, the game wasn't televised, so I haven't been able to see the goals but I do know Ngoo (2), Smith and Peterson were the scorers.

**Liverpool U18s** -- A U18 side, that was absent from such talents like Sinclair and Chirivella through injury, met Aston Villa at Langtree Park in the FA Youth cup 4th round. Due to this Sergi Canos was called upon to lead the line, with Ojo, Kent and Trickett-Smith behind. U21 pairing Brannagan and Rossiter sat deepest in midfield.  
Liverpool started well, Trickett-Smith and Kent having early opportunities from outside the box. Liverpool made the breakthrough, from a similar chance, too in the 19th minute. Ojo's cross field run broke to Maguire, who pushed forward from left back. He chipped a ball back to Trickett-Smith who took and score a sublime half volley. Soon after, however, Villa were level. They pushed forward on the counter attack and a simple ball into the box caused more problems than it should have. With neither Williams or Randall able to clear, Villa's striker McKirdy poked it in. Villa were on the forefront now, with Ojo giving away a poor pass in his own half, Crump was the only thing stopping McKirdy from making it 2-1 to the away side.  
Wilson replaced Ojo at half time, the Englishman not having the best half all around. Wilson was soon into action, winning a free kick 10 yards outside the area. Although, his attempt floated a yard or so over the bar. Villa were still in this, no doubt about it, and they emphasised that when Jordan Rossiter was forced to clear a header off the line. However, from that clearance Liverpool were able to counter, and it was Harry Wilson at the forefront of the counter attack. After a series of short passes Kent drove down the right and delivered Wilson with the ball. Although Canos and Trickett-Smith were open in the area, Wilson only had one thought in his mind. He cut onto his left foot and placed the ball into the bottom left corner. Liverpool regained the lead.  
Liverpool finished the tie off superbly, with what was Ryan Kent's second assist and Harry Wilson's second goal of the game. Maguire pressurised down the left hand side forcing the ball the break the Ryan Kent. Kent did brilliantly to beat two men, and shake off a third. Next, he played a inch perfect through ball to find Wilson. From that point on, the rest was a given. Wilson left two Villa players on their arses and again slotted into the bottom left corner. [\[GIF of Wilson's second goal here\]](http://gfycat.com/WelloffSardonicAlaskanhusky)  
Wilson almost finished off his hat trick when Kent, again, got it to him. However, his right footed shot was saved well. Final score, 3-1 Liverpool. [\[Highlights of the 3-1 win here\]](http://vimeo.com/84277984#at=0)  

The U18s were soon back in action, with a 5-0 win away to Blackburn. In a game where Neil Critchley made a surprising 9 changes, with only Sheyi Ojo and Sergi Canos retaining their starting places from mid-week.  
Liverpool were off to a flyer when Wilson played a lovely one-two with Sergi Canos, although his shot was saved well. Liverpool continued to play well, and made the breakthrough in the 10th minute with Sergi Canos intercepting the ball, playing in Ojo who smashed the ball into the top left corner with his left foot. Blackburn responded well, earning a free kick which resulted in a shot Firth was forced to save.  
Ojo drove forward down the left hand side, continued to look like Liverpool's biggest threat and won a corner. It was from that resulting corner of which Liverpool went 2-0 up. Marsh delivered a curling corner and Cleary finished it with a well placed header. Soon after, Blackburn's Jack Doyle was fortunate to not be sent off for a potentially leg breaking tackle. Liverpool didn't let this deter them. Ojo, again, driving forward down the left delivered a great ball to Canos who placed the ball in to make it 3-0. Liverpool were in full stride now, with left back Sam Hart striding forward, he opened up play. Eventually, the ball came to Wilson on the left, and as he beat his made and drove into the box he was fouled and won a penalty. Wilson slotted his penalty in to again score. Half time and it was 4-0 to Liverpool.  
Liverpool got their 5th before have time when Ojo was set clean through. He slotted past the 'keeper to further extend the lead. Blackburn looked more threatening, forcing Firth into making of impressive saves. Liverpool held on to their clean sheet to complete a superb performance. What was most impressive, was Ojo's performance. He bounced back extremely well after a poor spell midweek. Wilson continued to look much better than his age suggests, such an impressive talent. Canos seems to be settling in well, taking the chance of Sinclair's absence by the horns. Final score, 5-0 Liverpool.

This time with an appearance in Almeria's tough game away to a in-form Villarreal, Suso came on at half time with the score 1-0 to the home side but wasn't able to make a significant impact as they lost 2-0.

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Coady was disappointingly dropped to the bench for Sheffield United's home game vs Bradford, and was only able to make a very late substitute appearance. Although, it's disappointing to see Coady dropped, it proved an effective change as Sheffield drew 2-2 after two poor loses.

**Krisztián Adorján at Groningen** -- Adorjan and Groningen finally returned to action after their winter break as they drew 1-1 away to Waalwijk. Adorjan played a important role in attacking midfield, although he was sacrificed for defender Lorenzo Burnet when Groningen went down to 10 men. Leading at the time of this substitution, the man advantage helped Waalwijk as they grabbed a late equaliser.

**Pepe Reina at Napoli** -- Reina was absent again, through recovering from injury, as Napoli drew disappointingly with Bolonga due to a last minute equaliser. The game saw Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon give Napoli the lead after previously being 1-0 down. However, Ronlando Bianchi's literal last kick of the game goal, for then 10 men Bolonga, saw Napoli chance of the Scudetto slip further away.

**Jack Robinson at Blackpool** -- Robinson came up against Barnsley are their new addition in Ryan McLaughlin as Blackpool recorded their 4th consecutive loss. Again, there's little I can say about Blackpool. They show no sign of improving, and with questions of manager Paul Ince's future there could be further turmoil.

**Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City** -- Assaidi returned to Stoke's line up as they met bottom placed Crystal Palace. An easy fixture on paper, but Palace were determined and superb. With Assaidi coming off at the 70th minute, he wasn't able to perform to the level he was prior to a few weeks ago, and Stoke ultimately lost the game 1-0.

**Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC** -- Borini was pivotal to Sunderland turning around a tough game to Southampton. The in-form southerners were 2-0 up when [Borini got his sliced goal](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/fan_shot_images/317665/iCFvMYz54FJyv.gif). Borini continued to play well and Sunderland bagged a equaliser in the second half. They even continued to push on and looked close to getting a winner, with Borini scoring another only for it to be ruled out for offside.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Derby got back to winning ways with a tight 1-0 win against Brighton, Wisdom as always starting at right back. However, Wisdom was taken off prior to the goal in the close affair; being taken off for striker Conor Sammon, with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford getting the winner.

**Craig Roddan at Accrington Stanley** -- Roddan wasn't part of Accrington's squad for their 2-1 win against Cheltenham.

**Ryan Mclaughlin at Barnsley** -- Ryan McLaughlin made his Barnsley début directly against fellow Liverpool counterpart Jack Robinson. The right back displayed a number of his skills, highlighting his pace, ability to beat a player and passing ability numerous times. In what is certainly a impressive start, it's good to see McLaughlin finally getting a great chance at senior football after failing to push through to the first team. [\[Individual highlights of McLaughlin here\]](http://t.co/iupeALveRq)

**Tiago Ilori at Granada** -- Ilori recently finalised a move to 11th placed La Liga side Granada. With comments from Rodgers coming to light, it is evident a loan move in January has been in the pipe line for a while. Again, it's great to see us utilising the loan system, especially using clubs in Spain; playing against the very best is a priceless learning experience.

##The academy:

**Liverpool U21s** -- The U21s returned to attack after a prolonged winter break with a very tough match away to a strong Arsenal side consisting of the likes of Frimpong, Jenkinson and Oxlade-Chamberlain. Unfortunately, the game wasn't televised, so I haven't been able to see the goals but I do know Ngoo (2), Smith and Peterson were the scorers.

**Liverpool U18s** -- A U18 side, that was absent from such talents like Sinclair and Chirivella through injury, met Aston Villa at Langtree Park in the FA Youth cup 4th round. Due to this Sergi Canos was called upon to lead the line, with Ojo, Kent and Trickett-Smith behind. U21 pairing Brannagan and Rossiter sat deepest in midfield.  
Liverpool started well, Trickett-Smith and Kent having early opportunities from outside the box. Liverpool made the breakthrough, from a similar chance, too in the 19th minute. Ojo's cross field run broke to Maguire, who pushed forward from left back. He chipped a ball back to Trickett-Smith who took and score a sublime half volley. Soon after, however, Villa were level. They pushed forward on the counter attack and a simple ball into the box caused more problems than it should have. With neither Williams or Randall able to clear, Villa's striker McKirdy poked it in. Villa were on the forefront now, with Ojo giving away a poor pass in his own half, Crump was the only thing stopping McKirdy from making it 2-1 to the away side.  
Wilson replaced Ojo at half time, the Englishman not having the best half all around. Wilson was soon into action, winning a free kick 10 yards outside the area. Although, his attempt floated a yard or so over the bar. Villa were still in this, no doubt about it, and they emphasised that when Jordan Rossiter was forced to clear a header off the line. However, from that clearance Liverpool were able to counter, and it was Harry Wilson at the forefront of the counter attack. After a series of short passes Kent drove down the right and delivered Wilson with the ball. Although Canos and Trickett-Smith were open in the area, Wilson only had one thought in his mind. He cut onto his left foot and placed the ball into the bottom left corner. Liverpool regained the lead.  
Liverpool finished the tie off superbly, with what was Ryan Kent's second assist and Harry Wilson's second goal of the game. Maguire pressurised down the left hand side forcing the ball the break the Ryan Kent. Kent did brilliantly to beat two men, and shake off a third. Next, he played a inch perfect through ball to find Wilson. From that point on, the rest was a given. Wilson left two Villa players on their arses and again slotted into the bottom left corner. [\[GIF of Wilson's second goal here\]](http://gfycat.com/WelloffSardonicAlaskanhusky)  
Wilson almost finished off his hat trick when Kent, again, got it to him. However, his right footed shot was saved well. Final score, 3-1 Liverpool. [\[Highlights of the 3-1 win here\]](http://vimeo.com/84277984#at=0)  

The U18s were soon back in action, with a 5-0 win away to Blackburn. In a game where Neil Critchley made a surprising 9 changes, with only Sheyi Ojo and Sergi Canos retaining their starting places from mid-week.  
Liverpool were off to a flyer when Wilson played a lovely one-two with Sergi Canos, although his shot was saved well. Liverpool continued to play well, and made the breakthrough in the 10th minute with Sergi Canos intercepting the ball, playing in Ojo who smashed the ball into the top left corner with his left foot. Blackburn responded well, earning a free kick which resulted in a shot Firth was forced to save. Ojo drove forward down the left hand side, continued to look like Liverpool's biggest threat and won a corner. It was from that resulting corner of which Liverpool went 2-0 up. Marsh delivered a curling corner and Cleary finished it with a well placed header. Soon after, Blackburn's Jack Doyle was fortunate to not be sent off for a potentially leg breaking tackle. Liverpool didn't let this deter them. Ojo, again, driving forward down the left delivered a great ball to Canos who placed the ball in to make it 3-0. Liverpool were in full stride now, with left back Sam Hart striding forward, he opened up play. Eventually, the ball came to Wilson on the left, and as he beat his made and drove into the box he was fouled and won a penalty. Wilson slotted his penalty in to again score. Half time and it was 4-0 to Liverpool.  
Liverpool got their 5th before have time when Ojo was set clean through. He slotted past the 'keeper to further extend the lead. Blackburn looked more threatening, forcing Firth into making of impressive saves. Liverpool held on to their clean sheet to complete a superb performance. What was most impressive, was Ojo's performance. He bounced back extremely well after a poor spell midweek. Wilson continued to look much better than his age suggests, such an impressive talent. Canos seems to be settling in well, taking the chance of Sinclair's absence by the horns. Final score, 5-0 Liverpool.

**Suso at Almeria** -- As predicted, Suso had a major chance to impress in his favoured position of attacking midfield as Almeria met Racing in a home Copa del Rey second leg tie. Suso played 90 minutes in the game, of which Almeria unfortunately lost 2-0. A poor result, albeit against a better team, but Suso will be disappointed the not having made more of an impact. As of now, his best position looks out on the right wing where it is less likely he will doubled up on.

##Loans

**Suso at Almeria** -- As predicted, Suso had a major chance to impress in his favoured position of attacking midfield as Almeria met Racing in a home Copa del Rey second leg tie. Suso played 90 minutes in the game, of which Almeria unfortunately lost 2-0. A poor result, albeit against a better team, but Suso will be disappointed the not having made more of an impact. As of now, his best position looks out on the right wing where it is less likely he will doubled up on.  
Despite having played a major part in the recent Copa games Suso is still unfavoured in terms of a starting La Liga place. Although, he is beginning to weed his way back into contention. This time with an appearance in Almeria's tough game away to a in-form Villarreal, Suso came on at half time with the score 1-0 to the home side but wasn't able to make a significant impact as they lost 2-0.

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Coady was disappointingly dropped to the bench for Sheffield United's home game vs Bradford, and was only able to make a very late substitute appearance. Although, it's disappointing to see Coady dropped, it proved an effective change as Sheffield drew 2-2 after two poor loses.

**Krisztián Adorján at Groningen** -- Adorjan and Groningen finally returned to action after their winter break as they drew 1-1 away to Waalwijk. Adorjan played a important role in attacking midfield, although he was sacrificed for defender Lorenzo Burnet when Groningen went down to 10 men. Leading at the time of this substitution, the man advantage helped Waalwijk as they grabbed a late equaliser.

**Pepe Reina at Napoli** -- Reina was absent again, through recovering from injury, as Napoli drew disappointingly with Bolonga due to a last minute equaliser. The game saw Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon give Napoli the lead after previously being 1-0 down. However, Ronlando Bianchi's literal last kick of the game goal, for then 10 men Bolonga, saw Napoli chance of the Scudetto slip further away.

**Jack Robinson at Blackpool** -- Robinson came up against Barnsley are their new addition in Ryan McLaughlin as Blackpool recorded their 4th consecutive loss. Again, there's little I can say about Blackpool. They show no sign of improving, and with questions of manager Paul Ince's future there could be further turmoil.

**Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City** -- Assaidi returned to Stoke's line up as they met bottom placed Crystal Palace. An easy fixture on paper, but Palace were determined and superb. With Assaidi coming off at the 70th minute, he wasn't able to perform to the level he was prior to a few weeks ago, and Stoke ultimately lost the game 1-0.

**Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC** -- Borini was pivotal to Sunderland turning around a tough game to Southampton. The in-form southerners were 2-0 up when [Borini got his sliced goal](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/fan_shot_images/317665/iCFvMYz54FJyv.gif). Borini continued to play well and Sunderland bagged a equaliser in the second half. They even continued to push on and looked close to getting a winner, with Borini scoring another only for it to be ruled out for offside.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Derby got back to winning ways with a tight 1-0 win against Brighton, Wisdom as always starting at right back. However, Wisdom was taken off prior to the goal in the close affair; being taken off for striker Conor Sammon, with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford getting the winner.

**Craig Roddan at Accrington Stanley** -- Roddan wasn't part of Accrington's squad for their 2-1 win against Cheltenham.

**Ryan Mclaughlin at Barnsley** -- Ryan McLaughlin made his Barnsley début directly against fellow Liverpool counterpart Jack Robinson. The right back displayed a number of his skills, highlighting his pace, ability to beat a player and passing ability numerous times. In what is certainly a impressive start, it's good to see McLaughlin finally getting a great chance at senior football after failing to push through to the first team. [\[Individual highlights of McLaughlin here\]](http://t.co/iupeALveRq)

**Tiago Ilori at Granada** -- Ilori recently finalised a move to 11th placed La Liga side Granada. With comments from Rodgers coming to light, it is evident a loan move in January has been in the pipe line for a while. Again, it's great to see us utilising the loan system, especially using clubs in Spain; playing against the very best is a priceless learning experience.

##The academy:

**Liverpool U21s** -- The U21s returned to attack after a prolonged winter break with a very tough match away to a strong Arsenal side consisting of the likes of Frimpong, Jenkinson and Oxlade-Chamberlain. Unfortunately, the game wasn't televised, so I haven't been able to see the goals but I do know Ngoo (2), Smith and Peterson were the scorers.

**Liverpool U18s** -- A U18 side, that was absent from such talents like Sinclair and Chirivella through injury, met Aston Villa at Langtree Park in the FA Youth cup 4th round. Due to this Sergi Canos was called upon to lead the line, with Ojo, Kent and Trickett-Smith behind. U21 pairing Brannagan and Rossiter sat deepest in midfield.  
Liverpool started well, Trickett-Smith and Kent having early opportunities from outside the box. Liverpool made the breakthrough, from a similar chance, too in the 19th minute. Ojo's cross field run broke to Maguire, who pushed forward from left back. He chipped a ball back to Trickett-Smith who took and score a sublime half volley. Soon after, however, Villa were level. They pushed forward on the counter attack and a simple ball into the box caused more problems than it should have. With neither Williams or Randall able to clear, Villa's striker McKirdy poked it in. Villa were on the forefront now, with Ojo giving away a poor pass in his own half, Crump was the only thing stopping McKirdy from making it 2-1 to the away side.  
Wilson replaced Ojo at half time, the Englishman not having the best half all around. Wilson was soon into action, winning a free kick 10 yards outside the area. Although, his attempt floated a yard or so over the bar. Villa were still in this, no doubt about it, and they emphasised that when Jordan Rossiter was forced to clear a header off the line. However, from that clearance Liverpool were able to counter, and it was Harry Wilson at the forefront of the counter attack. After a series of short passes Kent drove down the right and delivered Wilson with the ball. Although Canos and Trickett-Smith were open in the area, Wilson only had one thought in his mind. He cut onto his left foot and placed the ball into the bottom left corner. Liverpool regained the lead.  
Liverpool finished the tie off superbly, with what was Ryan Kent's second assist and Harry Wilson's second goal of the game. Maguire pressurised down the left hand side forcing the ball the break the Ryan Kent. Kent did brilliantly to beat two men, and shake off a third. Next, he played a inch perfect through ball to find Wilson. From that point on, the rest was a given. Wilson left two Villa players on their arses and again slotted into the bottom left corner. [\[GIF of Wilson's second goal here\]](http://gfycat.com/WelloffSardonicAlaskanhusky)  
Wilson almost finished off his hat trick when Kent, again, got it to him. However, his right footed shot was saved well. Final score, 3-1 Liverpool. [\[Highlights of the 3-1 win here\]](http://vimeo.com/84277984#at=0)  

The U18s were soon back in action, with a 5-0 win away to Blackburn. In a game where Neil Critchley made a surprising 9 changes, with only Sheyi Ojo and Sergi Canos retaining their starting places from mid-week.  
Liverpool were off to a flyer when Wilson played a lovely one-two with Sergi Canos, although his shot was saved well. Liverpool continued to play well, and made the breakthrough in the 10th minute with Sergi Canos intercepting the ball, playing in Ojo who smashed the ball into the top left corner with his left foot. Blackburn responded well, earning a free kick which resulted in a shot Firth was forced to save. Ojo drove forward down the left hand side, continued to look like Liverpool's biggest threat and won a corner. It was from that resulting corner of which Liverpool went 2-0 up. Marsh delivered a curling corner and Cleary finished it with a well placed header. Soon after, Blackburn's Jack Doyle was fortunate to not be sent off for a potentially leg breaking tackle. Liverpool didn't let this deter them. Ojo, again, driving forward down the left delivered a great ball to Canos who placed the ball in to make it 3-0. Liverpool were in full stride now, with left back Sam Hart striding forward, he opened up play. Eventually, the ball came to Wilson on the left, and as he beat his made and drove into the box he was fouled and won a penalty. Wilson slotted his penalty in to again score. Half time and it was 4-0 to Liverpool.   
Liverpool got their 5th before have time when Ojo was set clean through. He slotted past the 'keeper to further extend the lead. Blackburn looked more threatening, forcing Firth into making of impressive saves. Liverpool held on to their clean sheet to complete a superb performance. What was most impressive, was Ojo's performance. He bounced back extremely well after a poor spell midweek. Wilson continued to look much better than his age suggests, such an impressive talent. Canos seems to be settling in well, taking the chance of Sinclair's absence by the horns. Final score, 5-0 Liverpool.

Villa were on the forefront now, with Ojo giving away a poor pass in his own half, Crump was the only thing stopping McKirdy from making it 2-1 to the away side.  
Wilson replaced Ojo at half time, the Englishman not having the best half all around. Wilson was soon into action, winning a free kick 10 yards outside the area. Although, his attempt floated a yard or so over the bar. Villa were still in this, no doubt about it, and they emphasised that when Jordan Rossiter was forced to clear a header off the line. However, from that clearance Liverpool were able to counter, and it was Harry Wilson at the forefront of the counter attack. After a series of short passes Kent drove down the right and delivered Wilson with the ball. Although Canos and Trickett-Smith were open in the area, Wilson only had one thought in his mind. He cut onto his left foot and placed the ball into the bottom left corner. Liverpool regained the lead.  
Liverpool finished the tie off superbly, with what was Ryan Kent's second assist and Harry Wilson's second goal of the game. Maguire pressurised down the left hand side forcing the ball the break the Ryan Kent. Kent did brilliantly to beat two men, and shake off a third. Next, he played a inch perfect through ball to find Wilson. From that point on, the rest was a given. Wilson left two Villa players on their arses and again slotted into the bottom left corner. [\[GIF of Wilson's second goal here\]](http://gfycat.com/WelloffSardonicAlaskanhusky)  
Wilson almost finished off his hat trick when Kent, again, got it to him. However, his right footed shot was saved well. Final score, 3-1 Liverpool. [\[Highlights of the 3-1 win here\]](http://vimeo.com/84277984#at=0)  

The U18s were soon back in action, with a 5-0 win away to Blackburn. In a game where Neil Critchley made a surprising 9 changes, with only Sheyi Ojo and Sergi Canos retaining their starting places from mid-week.  
Liverpool were off to a flyer when Wilson played a lovely one-two with Sergi Canos, although his shot was saved well. Liverpool continued to play well, and made the breakthrough in the 10th minute with Sergi Canos intercepting the ball, playing in Ojo who smashed the ball into the top left corner with his left foot. Blackburn responded well, earning a free kick which resulted in a shot Firth was forced to save. Ojo drove forward down the left hand side, continued to look like Liverpool's biggest threat and won a corner. It was from that resulting corner of which Liverpool went 2-0 up. Marsh delivered a curling corner and Cleary finished it with a well placed header. Soon after, Blackburn's Jack Doyle was fortunate to not be sent off for a potentially leg breaking tackle. Liverpool didn't let this deter them. Ojo, again, driving forward down the left delivered a great ball to Canos who placed the ball in to make it 3-0. Liverpool were in full stride now, with left back Sam Hart striding forward, he opened up play. Eventually, the ball came to Wilson on the left, and as he beat his made and drove into the box he was fouled and won a penalty. Wilson slotted his penalty in to again score. Half time and it was 4-0 to Liverpool.   
Liverpool got their 5th before have time when Ojo was set clean through. He slotted past the 'keeper to further extend the lead. Blackburn looked more threatening, forcing Firth into making of impressive saves. Liverpool held on to their clean sheet to complete a superb performance. What was most impressive, was Ojo's performance. He bounced back extremely well after a poor spell midweek. Wilson continued to look much better than his age suggests, such an impressive talent. Canos seems to be settling in well, taking the chance of Sinclair's absence by the horns. Final score, 5-0 Liverpool.

##Loans

**Suso at Almeria** -- As predicted, Suso had a major chance to impress in his favoured position of attacking midfield as Almeria met Racing in a home Copa del Rey second leg tie. Suso played 90 minutes in the game, of which Almeria unfortunately lost 2-0. A poor result, albeit against a better team, but Suso will be disappointed the not having made more of an impact. As of now, his best position looks out on the right wing where it is less likely he will doubled up on.  
Despite having played a major part in the recent Copa games Suso is still unfavoured in terms of a starting La Liga place. Although, he is beginning to weed his way back into contention. This time with an appearance in Almeria's tough game away to a in-form Villarreal, Suso came on at half time with the score 1-0 to the home side but wasn't able to make a significant impact as they lost 2-0.

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Coady was disappointingly dropped to the bench for Sheffield United's home game vs Bradford, and was only able to make a very late substitute appearance. Although, it's disappointing to see Coady dropped, it proved an effective change as Sheffield drew 2-2 after two poor loses.

**Krisztián Adorján at Groningen** -- Adorjan and Groningen finally returned to action after their winter break as they drew 1-1 away to Waalwijk. Adorjan played a important role in attacking midfield, although he was sacrificed for defender Lorenzo Burnet when Groningen went down to 10 men. Leading at the time of this substitution, the man advantage helped Waalwijk as they grabbed a late equaliser.

**Pepe Reina at Napoli** -- Reina was absent again, through recovering from injury, as Napoli drew disappointingly with Bolonga due to a last minute equaliser. The game saw Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon give Napoli the lead after previously being 1-0 down. However, Ronlando Bianchi's literal last kick of the game goal, for then 10 men Bolonga, saw Napoli chance of the Scudetto slip further away.

**Jack Robinson at Blackpool** -- Robinson came up against Barnsley are their new addition in Ryan McLaughlin as Blackpool recorded their 4th consecutive loss. Again, there's little I can say about Blackpool. They show no sign of improving, and with questions of manager Paul Ince's future there could be further turmoil.

**Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City** -- Assaidi returned to Stoke's line up as they met bottom placed Crystal Palace. An easy fixture on paper, but Palace were determined and superb. With Assaidi coming off at the 70th minute, he wasn't able to perform to the level he was prior to a few weeks ago, and Stoke ultimately lost the game 1-0.

**Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC** -- Borini was pivotal to Sunderland turning around a tough game to Southampton. The in-form southerners were 2-0 up when [Borini got his sliced goal](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/fan_shot_images/317665/iCFvMYz54FJyv.gif). Borini continued to play well and Sunderland bagged a equaliser in the second half. They even continued to push on and looked close to getting a winner, with Borini scoring another only for it to be ruled out for offside.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Derby got back to winning ways with a tight 1-0 win against Brighton, Wisdom as always starting at right back. However, Wisdom was taken off prior to the goal in the close affair; being taken off for striker Conor Sammon, with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford getting the winner.

**Craig Roddan at Accrington Stanley** -- Roddan wasn't part of Accrington's squad for their 2-1 win against Cheltenham.

**Ryan Mclaughlin at Barnsley** -- Ryan McLaughlin made his Barnsley début directly against fellow Liverpool counterpart Jack Robinson. The right back displayed a number of his skills, highlighting his pace, ability to beat a player and passing ability numerous times. In what is certainly a impressive start, it's good to see McLaughlin finally getting a great chance at senior football after failing to push through to the first team. [\[Individual highlights of McLaughlin here\]](http://t.co/iupeALveRq)

**Tiago Ilori at Granada** -- Ilori recently finalised a move to 11th placed La Liga side Granada. With comments from Rodgers coming to light, it is evident a loan move in January has been in the pipe line for a while. Again, it's great to see us utilising the loan system, especially using clubs in Spain; playing against the very best is a priceless learning experience.

##The academy:

**Liverpool U21s** -- The U21s returned to attack after a prolonged winter break with a very tough match away to a strong Arsenal side consisting of the likes of Frimpong, Jenkinson and Oxlade-Chamberlain. Unfortunately, the game wasn't televised, so I haven't been able to see the goals but I do know Ngoo (2), Smith and Peterson were the scorers.

**Liverpool U18s** -- A U18 side, that was absent from such talents like Sinclair and Chirivella through injury, met Aston Villa at Langtree Park in the FA Youth cup 4th round. Due to this Sergi Canos was called upon to lead the line, with Ojo, Kent and Trickett-Smith behind. U21 pairing Brannagan and Rossiter sat deepest in midfield.  
Liverpool started well, Trickett-Smith and Kent having early opportunities from outside the box. Liverpool made the breakthrough, from a similar chance, too in the 19th minute. Ojo's cross field run broke to Maguire, who pushed forward from left back. He chipped a ball back to Trickett-Smith who took and score a sublime half volley. Soon after, however, Villa were level. They pushed forward on the counter attack and a simple ball into the box caused more problems than it should have. With neither Williams or Randall able to clear, Villa's striker McKirdy poked it in.

Wilson replaced Ojo at half time, the Englishman not having the best half all around. Wilson was soon into action, winning a free kick 10 yards outside the area. Although, his attempt floated a yard or so over the bar. Villa were still in this, no doubt about it, and they emphasised that when Jordan Rossiter was forced to clear a header off the line. However, from that clearance Liverpool were able to counter, and it was Harry Wilson at the forefront of the counter attack. After a series of short passes Kent drove down the right and delivered Wilson with the ball. Although Canos and Trickett-Smith were open in the area, Wilson only had one thought in his mind. He cut onto his left foot and placed the ball into the bottom left corner. Liverpool regained the lead.  
Liverpool finished the tie off superbly, with what was Ryan Kent's second assist and Harry Wilson's second goal of the game. Maguire pressurised down the left hand side forcing the ball the break the Ryan Kent. Kent did brilliantly to beat two men, and shake off a third. Next, he played a inch perfect through ball to find Wilson. From that point on, the rest was a given. Wilson left two Villa players on their arses and again slotted into the bottom left corner. [\[GIF of Wilson's second goal here\]](http://gfycat.com/WelloffSardonicAlaskanhusky)  
Wilson almost finished off his hat trick when Kent, again, got it to him. However, his right footed shot was saved well. Final score, 3-1 Liverpool. [\[Highlights of the 3-1 win here\]](http://vimeo.com/84277984#at=0)  

The U18s were soon back in action, with a 5-0 win away to Blackburn. In a game where Neil Critchley made a surprising 9 changes, with only Sheyi Ojo and Sergi Canos retaining their starting places from mid-week.  
Liverpool were off to a flyer when Wilson played a lovely one-two with Sergi Canos, although his shot was saved well. Liverpool continued to play well, and made the breakthrough in the 10th minute with Sergi Canos intercepting the ball, playing in Ojo who smashed the ball into the top left corner with his left foot. Blackburn responded well, earning a free kick which resulted in a shot Firth was forced to save. Ojo drove forward down the left hand side, continued to look like Liverpool's biggest threat and won a corner. It was from that resulting corner of which Liverpool went 2-0 up. Marsh delivered a curling corner and Cleary finished it with a well placed header. Soon after, Blackburn's Jack Doyle was fortunate to not be sent off for a potentially leg breaking tackle. Liverpool didn't let this deter them. Ojo, again, driving forward down the left delivered a great ball to Canos who placed the ball in to make it 3-0. Liverpool were in full stride now, with left back Sam Hart striding forward, he opened up play. Eventually, the ball came to Wilson on the left, and as he beat his made and drove into the box he was fouled and won a penalty. Wilson slotted his penalty in to again score. Half time and it was 4-0 to Liverpool.   
Liverpool got their 5th before have time when Ojo was set clean through. He slotted past the 'keeper to further extend the lead. Blackburn looked more threatening, forcing Firth into making of impressive saves. Liverpool held on to their clean sheet to complete a superb performance. What was most impressive, was Ojo's performance. He bounced back extremely well after a poor spell midweek. Wilson continued to look much better than his age suggests, such an impressive talent. Canos seems to be settling in well, taking the chance of Sinclair's absence by the horns. Final score, 5-0 Liverpool.

##Loans

**Suso at Almeria** -- As predicted, Suso had a major chance to impress in his favoured position of attacking midfield as Almeria met Racing in a home Copa del Rey second leg tie. Suso played 90 minutes in the game, of which Almeria unfortunately lost 2-0. A poor result, albeit against a better team, but Suso will be disappointed the not having made more of an impact. As of now, his best position looks out on the right wing where it is less likely he will doubled up on.  
Despite having played a major part in the recent Copa games Suso is still unfavoured in terms of a starting La Liga place. Although, he is beginning to weed his way back into contention. This time with an appearance in Almeria's tough game away to a in-form Villarreal, Suso came on at half time with the score 1-0 to the home side but wasn't able to make a significant impact as they lost 2-0.

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Coady was disappointingly dropped to the bench for Sheffield United's home game vs Bradford, and was only able to make a very late substitute appearance. Although, it's disappointing to see Coady dropped, it proved an effective change as Sheffield drew 2-2 after two poor loses.

**Krisztián Adorján at Groningen** -- Adorjan and Groningen finally returned to action after their winter break as they drew 1-1 away to Waalwijk. Adorjan played a important role in attacking midfield, although he was sacrificed for defender Lorenzo Burnet when Groningen went down to 10 men. Leading at the time of this substitution, the man advantage helped Waalwijk as they grabbed a late equaliser.

**Pepe Reina at Napoli** -- Reina was absent again, through recovering from injury, as Napoli drew disappointingly with Bolonga due to a last minute equaliser. The game saw Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon give Napoli the lead after previously being 1-0 down. However, Ronlando Bianchi's literal last kick of the game goal, for then 10 men Bolonga, saw Napoli chance of the Scudetto slip further away.

**Jack Robinson at Blackpool** -- Robinson came up against Barnsley are their new addition in Ryan McLaughlin as Blackpool recorded their 4th consecutive loss. Again, there's little I can say about Blackpool. They show no sign of improving, and with questions of manager Paul Ince's future there could be further turmoil.

**Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City** -- Assaidi returned to Stoke's line up as they met bottom placed Crystal Palace. An easy fixture on paper, but Palace were determined and superb. With Assaidi coming off at the 70th minute, he wasn't able to perform to the level he was prior to a few weeks ago, and Stoke ultimately lost the game 1-0.

**Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC** -- Borini was pivotal to Sunderland turning around a tough game to Southampton. The in-form southerners were 2-0 up when [Borini got his sliced goal](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/fan_shot_images/317665/iCFvMYz54FJyv.gif). Borini continued to play well and Sunderland bagged a equaliser in the second half. They even continued to push on and looked close to getting a winner, with Borini scoring another only for it to be ruled out for offside.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Derby got back to winning ways with a tight 1-0 win against Brighton, Wisdom as always starting at right back. However, Wisdom was taken off prior to the goal in the close affair; being taken off for striker Conor Sammon, with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford getting the winner.

**Craig Roddan at Accrington Stanley** -- Roddan wasn't part of Accrington's squad for their 2-1 win against Cheltenham.

**Ryan Mclaughlin at Barnsley** -- Ryan McLaughlin made his Barnsley début directly against fellow Liverpool counterpart Jack Robinson. The right back displayed a number of his skills, highlighting his pace, ability to beat a player and passing ability numerous times. In what is certainly a impressive start, it's good to see McLaughlin finally getting a great chance at senior football after failing to push through to the first team. [\[Individual highlights of McLaughlin here\]](http://t.co/iupeALveRq)

**Tiago Ilori at Granada** -- Ilori recently finalised a move to 11th placed La Liga side Granada. With comments from Rodgers coming to light, it is evident a loan move in January has been in the pipe line for a while. Again, it's great to see us utilising the loan system, especially using clubs in Spain; playing against the very best is a priceless learning experience.

##The academy:

**Liverpool U21s** -- The U21s returned to attack after a prolonged winter break with a very tough match away to a strong Arsenal side consisting of the likes of Frimpong, Jenkinson and Oxlade-Chamberlain. Unfortunately, the game wasn't televised, so I haven't been able to see the goals but I do know Ngoo (2), Smith and Peterson were the scorers.

**Liverpool U18s** -- A U18 side, that was absent from such talents like Sinclair and Chirivella through injury, met Aston Villa at Langtree Park in the FA Youth cup 4th round. Due to this Sergi Canos was called upon to lead the line, with Ojo, Kent and Trickett-Smith behind. U21 pairing Brannagan and Rossiter sat deepest in midfield.  
Liverpool started well, Trickett-Smith and Kent having early opportunities from outside the box. Liverpool made the breakthrough, from a similar chance, too in the 19th minute. Ojo's cross field run broke to Maguire, who pushed forward from left back. He chipped a ball back to Trickett-Smith who took and score a sublime half volley. Soon after, however, Villa were level. They pushed forward on the counter attack and a simple ball into the box caused more problems than it should have. With neither Williams or Randall able to clear, Villa's striker McKirdy poked it in. Villa were on the forefront now, with Ojo giving away a poor pass in his own half, Crump was the only thing stopping McKirdy from making it 2-1 to the away side.

**Suso at Almeria** -- As predicted, Suso had a major chance to impress in his favoured position of attacking midfield as Almeria met Racing in a home Copa del Rey second leg tie. Suso played 90 minutes in the game, of which Almeria unfortunately lost 2-0. A poor result, albeit against a better team, but Suso will be disappointed the not having made more of an impact. As of now, his best position looks out on the right wing where it is less likely he will doubled up on.  
Despite having played a major part in the recent Copa games Suso is still unfavoured in terms of a starting La Liga place. Although, he is beginning to weed his way back into contention. This time with an appearance in Almeria's tough game away to a in-form Villarreal, Suso came on at half time with the score 1-0 to the home side but wasn't able to make a significant impact as they lost 2-0.

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Coady was disappointingly dropped to the bench for Sheffield United's home game vs Bradford, and was only able to make a very late substitute appearance. Although, it's disappointing to see Coady dropped, it proved an effective change as Sheffield drew 2-2 after two poor loses.

**Krisztián Adorján at Groningen** -- Adorjan and Groningen finally returned to action after their winter break as they drew 1-1 away to Waalwijk. Adorjan played a important role in attacking midfield, although he was sacrificed for defender Lorenzo Burnet when Groningen went down to 10 men. Leading at the time of this substitution, the man advantage helped Waalwijk as they grabbed a late equaliser.

**Pepe Reina at Napoli** -- Reina was absent again, through recovering from injury, as Napoli drew disappointingly with Bolonga due to a last minute equaliser. The game saw Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon give Napoli the lead after previously being 1-0 down. However, Ronlando Bianchi's literal last kick of the game goal, for then 10 men Bolonga, saw Napoli chance of the Scudetto slip further away.

**Jack Robinson at Blackpool** -- Robinson came up against Barnsley are their new addition in Ryan McLaughlin as Blackpool recorded their 4th consecutive loss. Again, there's little I can say about Blackpool. They show no sign of improving, and with questions of manager Paul Ince's future there could be further turmoil.

**Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City** -- Assaidi returned to Stoke's line up as they met bottom placed Crystal Palace. An easy fixture on paper, but Palace were determined and superb. With Assaidi coming off at the 70th minute, he wasn't able to perform to the level he was prior to a few weeks ago, and Stoke ultimately lost the game 1-0.

**Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC** -- Borini was pivotal to Sunderland turning around a tough game to Southampton. The in-form southerners were 2-0 up when [Borini got his sliced goal](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/fan_shot_images/317665/iCFvMYz54FJyv.gif). Borini continued to play well and Sunderland bagged a equaliser in the second half. They even continued to push on and looked close to getting a winner, with Borini scoring another only for it to be ruled out for offside.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Derby got back to winning ways with a tight 1-0 win against Brighton, Wisdom as always starting at right back. However, Wisdom was taken off prior to the goal in the close affair; being taken off for striker Conor Sammon, with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford getting the winner.

**Craig Roddan at Accrington Stanley** -- Roddan wasn't part of Accrington's squad for their 2-1 win against Cheltenham.

**Ryan Mclaughlin at Barnsley** -- Ryan McLaughlin made his Barnsley début directly against fellow Liverpool counterpart Jack Robinson. The right back displayed a number of his skills, highlighting his pace, ability to beat a player and passing ability numerous times. In what is certainly a impressive start, it's good to see McLaughlin finally getting a great chance at senior football after failing to push through to the first team. [\[Individual highlights of McLaughlin here\]](http://t.co/iupeALveRq)

**Tiago Ilori at Granada** -- Ilori recently finalised a move to 11th placed La Liga side Granada. With comments from Rodgers coming to light, it is evident a loan move in January has been in the pipe line for a while. Again, it's great to see us utilising the loan system, especially using clubs in Spain; playing against the very best is a priceless learning experience.

##The academy:

**Liverpool U21s** -- The U21s returned to attack after a prolonged winter break with a very tough match away to a strong Arsenal side consisting of the likes of Frimpong, Jenkinson and Oxlade-Chamberlain. Unfortunately, the game wasn't televised, so I haven't been able to see the goals but I do know Ngoo (2), Smith and Peterson were the scorers.

**Liverpool U18s** -- A U18 side, that was absent from such talents like Sinclair and Chirivella through injury, met Aston Villa at Langtree Park in the FA Youth cup 4th round. Due to this Sergi Canos was called upon to lead the line, with Ojo, Kent and Trickett-Smith behind. U21 pairing Brannagan and Rossiter sat deepest in midfield.  
Liverpool started well, Trickett-Smith and Kent having early opportunities from outside the box. Liverpool made the breakthrough, from a similar chance, too in the 19th minute. Ojo's cross field run broke to Maguire, who pushed forward from left back. He chipped a ball back to Trickett-Smith who took and score a sublime half volley. Soon after, however, Villa were level. They pushed forward on the counter attack and a simple ball into the box caused more problems than it should have. With neither Williams or Randall able to clear, Villa's striker McKirdy poked it in. Villa were on the forefront now, with Ojo giving away a poor pass in his own half, Crump was the only thing stopping McKirdy from making it 2-1 to the away side.  
Wilson replaced Ojo at half time, the Englishman not having the best half all around. Wilson was soon into action, winning a free kick 10 yards outside the area. Although, his attempt floated a yard or so over the bar. Villa were still in this, no doubt about it, and they emphasised that when Jordan Rossiter was forced to clear a header off the line. However, from that clearance Liverpool were able to counter, and it was Harry Wilson at the forefront of the counter attack. After a series of short passes Kent drove down the right and delivered Wilson with the ball. Although Canos and Trickett-Smith were open in the area, Wilson only had one thought in his mind. He cut onto his left foot and placed the ball into the bottom left corner. Liverpool regained the lead.  
Liverpool finished the tie off superbly, with what was Ryan Kent's second assist and Harry Wilson's second goal of the game. Maguire pressurised down the left hand side forcing the ball the break the Ryan Kent. Kent did brilliantly to beat two men, and shake off a third. Next, he played a inch perfect through ball to find Wilson. From that point on, the rest was a given. Wilson left two Villa players on their arses and again slotted into the bottom left corner. [\[GIF of Wilson's second goal here\]](http://gfycat.com/WelloffSardonicAlaskanhusky)  
Wilson almost finished off his hat trick when Kent, again, got it to him. However, his right footed shot was saved well. Final score, 3-1 Liverpool. [\[Highlights of the 3-1 win here\]](http://vimeo.com/84277984#at=0)  

The U18s were soon back in action, with a 5-0 win away to Blackburn. In a game where Neil Critchley made a surprising 9 changes, with only Sheyi Ojo and Sergi Canos retaining their starting places from mid-week.  
Liverpool were off to a flyer when Wilson played a lovely one-two with Sergi Canos, although his shot was saved well. Liverpool continued to play well, and made the breakthrough in the 10th minute with Sergi Canos intercepting the ball, playing in Ojo who smashed the ball into the top left corner with his left foot. Blackburn responded well, earning a free kick which resulted in a shot Firth was forced to save. Ojo drove forward down the left hand side, continued to look like Liverpool's biggest threat and won a corner. It was from that resulting corner of which Liverpool went 2-0 up. Marsh delivered a curling corner and Cleary finished it with a well placed header. Soon after, Blackburn's Jack Doyle was fortunate to not be sent off for a potentially leg breaking tackle. Liverpool didn't let this deter them. Ojo, again, driving forward down the left delivered a great ball to Canos who placed the ball in to make it 3-0. Liverpool were in full stride now, with left back Sam Hart striding forward, he opened up play. Eventually, the ball came to Wilson on the left, and as he beat his made and drove into the box he was fouled and won a penalty. Wilson slotted his penalty in to again score. Half time and it was 4-0 to Liverpool.   
Liverpool got their 5th before have time when Ojo was set clean through. He slotted past the 'keeper to further extend the lead. Blackburn looked more threatening, forcing Firth into making of impressive saves. Liverpool held on to their clean sheet to complete a superb performance. What was most impressive, was Ojo's performance. He bounced back extremely well after a poor spell midweek. Wilson continued to look much better than his age suggests, such an impressive talent. Canos seems to be settling in well, taking the chance of Sinclair's absence by the horns. Final score, 5-0 Liverpool.

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Coady was disappointingly dropped to the bench for Sheffield United's home game vs Bradford, and was only able to make a very late substitute appearance. Although, it's disappointing to see Coady dropped, it proved an effective change as Sheffield drew 2-2 after two poor loses.

**Krisztián Adorján at Groningen** -- Adorjan and Groningen finally returned to action after their winter break as they drew 1-1 away to Waalwijk.

Again, there's little I can say about Blackpool. They show no sign of improving, and with questions of manager Paul Ince's future there could be further turmoil. **Update:** Paul Ince has today been sacked. Not really too surprising. Hopefully Robinson retains his place.

With Assaidi coming off at the 70th minute, he wasn't able to perform to the level he was prior to a few weeks ago, and Stoke ultimately lost the game 1-0.

The in-form southerners were 2-0 up when [Borini got his sliced goal](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/fan_shot_images/317665/iCFvMYz54FJyv.gif). Borini continued to play well and Sunderland bagged a equaliser in the second half. They even continued to push on and looked close to getting a winner, with Borini scoring another only for it to be ruled out for offside.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Derby got back to winning ways with a tight 1-0 win against Brighton, Wisdom as always starting at right back. However, Wisdom was taken off prior to the goal in the close affair; being taken off for striker Conor Sammon, with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford getting the winner.

**Craig Roddan at Accrington Stanley** -- Roddan wasn't part of Accrington's squad for their 2-1 win against Cheltenham.

**Ryan Mclaughlin at Barnsley** -- Ryan McLaughlin made his Barnsley début directly against fellow Liverpool counterpart Jack Robinson. The right back displayed a number of his skills, highlighting his pace, ability to beat a player and passing ability numerous times. In what is certainly a impressive start, it's good to see McLaughlin finally getting a great chance at senior football after failing to push through to the first team. [\[Individual highlights of McLaughlin here\]](http://t.co/iupeALveRq)

**Tiago Ilori at Granada** -- Ilori recently finalised a move to 11th placed La Liga side Granada. With comments from Rodgers coming to light, it is evident a loan move in January has been in the pipe line for a while. Again, it's great to see us utilising the loan system, especially using clubs in Spain; playing against the very best is a priceless learning experience.

##The academy:

**Liverpool U21s** -- The U21s returned to attack after a prolonged winter break with a very tough match away to a strong Arsenal side consisting of the likes of Frimpong, Jenkinson and Oxlade-Chamberlain. Unfortunately, the game wasn't televised, so I haven't been able to see the goals but I do know Ngoo (2), Smith and Peterson were the scorers.

**Liverpool U18s** -- A U18 side, that was absent from such talents like Sinclair and Chirivella through injury, met Aston Villa at Langtree Park in the FA Youth cup 4th round. Due to this Sergi Canos was called upon to lead the line, with Ojo, Kent and Trickett-Smith behind. U21 pairing Brannagan and Rossiter sat deepest in midfield.  
Liverpool started well, Trickett-Smith and Kent having early opportunities from outside the box. Liverpool made the breakthrough, from a similar chance, too in the 19th minute. Ojo's cross field run broke to Maguire, who pushed forward from left back. He chipped a ball back to Trickett-Smith who took and score a sublime half volley. Soon after, however, Villa were level. They pushed forward on the counter attack and a simple ball into the box caused more problems than it should have. With neither Williams or Randall able to clear, Villa's striker McKirdy poked it in. Villa were on the forefront now, with Ojo giving away a poor pass in his own half, Crump was the only thing stopping McKirdy from making it 2-1 to the away side.  
Wilson replaced Ojo at half time, the Englishman not having the best half all around. Wilson was soon into action, winning a free kick 10 yards outside the area. Although, his attempt floated a yard or so over the bar. Villa were still in this, no doubt about it, and they emphasised that when Jordan Rossiter was forced to clear a header off the line. However, from that clearance Liverpool were able to counter, and it was Harry Wilson at the forefront of the counter attack. After a series of short passes Kent drove down the right and delivered Wilson with the ball. Although Canos and Trickett-Smith were open in the area, Wilson only had one thought in his mind. He cut onto his left foot and placed the ball into the bottom left corner. Liverpool regained the lead.  
Liverpool finished the tie off superbly, with what was Ryan Kent's second assist and Harry Wilson's second goal of the game. Maguire pressurised down the left hand side forcing the ball the break the Ryan Kent. Kent did brilliantly to beat two men, and shake off a third. Next, he played a inch perfect through ball to find Wilson. From that point on, the rest was a given. Wilson left two Villa players on their arses and again slotted into the bottom left corner. [\[GIF of Wilson's second goal here\]](http://gfycat.com/WelloffSardonicAlaskanhusky)  
Wilson almost finished off his hat trick when Kent, again, got it to him. However, his right footed shot was saved well. Final score, 3-1 Liverpool. [\[Highlights of the 3-1 win here\]](http://vimeo.com/84277984#at=0)  

The U18s were soon back in action, with a 5-0 win away to Blackburn. In a game where Neil Critchley made a surprising 9 changes, with only Sheyi Ojo and Sergi Canos retaining their starting places from mid-week.  
Liverpool were off to a flyer when Wilson played a lovely one-two with Sergi Canos, although his shot was saved well. Liverpool continued to play well, and made the breakthrough in the 10th minute with Sergi Canos intercepting the ball, playing in Ojo who smashed the ball into the top left corner with his left foot. Blackburn responded well, earning a free kick which resulted in a shot Firth was forced to save. Ojo drove forward down the left hand side, continued to look like Liverpool's biggest threat and won a corner. It was from that resulting corner of which Liverpool went 2-0 up. Marsh delivered a curling corner and Cleary finished it with a well placed header. Soon after, Blackburn's Jack Doyle was fortunate to not be sent off for a potentially leg breaking tackle. Liverpool didn't let this deter them. Ojo, again, driving forward down the left delivered a great ball to Canos who placed the ball in to make it 3-0. Liverpool were in full stride now, with left back Sam Hart striding forward, he opened up play. Eventually, the ball came to Wilson on the left, and as he beat his made and drove into the box he was fouled and won a penalty. Wilson slotted his penalty in to again score. Half time and it was 4-0 to Liverpool.   
Liverpool got their 5th before have time when Ojo was set clean through. He slotted past the 'keeper to further extend the lead. Blackburn looked more threatening, forcing Firth into making of impressive saves. Liverpool held on to their clean sheet to complete a superb performance. What was most impressive, was Ojo's performance. He bounced back extremely well after a poor spell midweek. Wilson continued to look much better than his age suggests, such an impressive talent. Canos seems to be settling in well, taking the chance of Sinclair's absence by the horns. Final score, 5-0 Liverpool.

##Loans

**Suso at Almeria** -- As predicted, Suso had a major chance to impress in his favoured position of attacking midfield as Almeria met Racing in a home Copa del Rey second leg tie. Suso played 90 minutes in the game, of which Almeria unfortunately lost 2-0. A poor result, albeit against a better team, but Suso will be disappointed the not having made more of an impact. As of now, his best position looks out on the right wing where it is less likely he will doubled up on.  
Despite having played a major part in the recent Copa games Suso is still unfavoured in terms of a starting La Liga place. Although, he is beginning to weed his way back into contention. This time with an appearance in Almeria's tough game away to a in-form Villarreal, Suso came on at half time with the score 1-0 to the home side but wasn't able to make a significant impact as they lost 2-0.

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Coady was disappointingly dropped to the bench for Sheffield United's home game vs Bradford, and was only able to make a very late substitute appearance. Although, it's disappointing to see Coady dropped, it proved an effective change as Sheffield drew 2-2 after two poor loses.

**Krisztián Adorján at Groningen** -- Adorjan and Groningen finally returned to action after their winter break as they drew 1-1 away to Waalwijk. Adorjan played a important role in attacking midfield, although he was sacrificed for defender Lorenzo Burnet when Groningen went down to 10 men. Leading at the time of this substitution, the man advantage helped Waalwijk as they grabbed a late equaliser.

**Pepe Reina at Napoli** -- Reina was absent again, through recovering from injury, as Napoli drew disappointingly with Bolonga due to a last minute equaliser. The game saw Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon give Napoli the lead after previously being 1-0 down. However, Ronlando Bianchi's literal last kick of the game goal, for then 10 men Bolonga, saw Napoli chance of the Scudetto slip further away.

**Jack Robinson at Blackpool** -- Robinson came up against Barnsley are their new addition in Ryan McLaughlin as Blackpool recorded their 4th consecutive loss. Again, there's little I can say about Blackpool. They show no sign of improving, and with questions of manager Paul Ince's future there could be further turmoil. **Update:** Paul Ince has today been sacked. Not really too surprising. Hopefully Robinson retains his place.

**Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City** -- Assaidi returned to Stoke's line up as they met bottom placed Crystal Palace. An easy fixture on paper, but Palace were determined and superb. With Assaidi coming off at the 70th minute, he wasn't able to perform to the level he was prior to a few weeks ago, and Stoke ultimately lost the game 1-0.

**Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC** -- Borini was pivotal to Sunderland turning around a tough game to Southampton. The in-form southerners were 2-0 up when [Borini got his sliced goal]. Borini continued to play well and Sunderland bagged a equaliser in the second half. They even continued to push on and looked close to getting a winner, with Borini scoring another only for it to be ruled out for offside.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Derby got back to winning ways with a tight 1-0 win against Brighton, Wisdom as always starting at right back. However, Wisdom was taken off prior to the goal in the close affair; being taken off for striker Conor Sammon, with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford getting the winner.

**Craig Roddan at Accrington Stanley** -- Roddan wasn't part of Accrington's squad for their 2-1 win against Cheltenham.

**Ryan Mclaughlin at Barnsley** -- Ryan McLaughlin made his Barnsley début directly against fellow Liverpool counterpart Jack Robinson. The right back displayed a number of his skills, highlighting his pace, ability to beat a player and passing ability numerous times. In what is certainly a impressive start, it's good to see McLaughlin finally getting a great chance at senior football after failing to push through to the first team. [\[Individual highlights of McLaughlin here\]]

**Tiago Ilori at Granada** -- Ilori recently finalised a move to 11th placed La Liga side Granada. With comments from Rodgers coming to light, it is evident a loan move in January has been in the pipe line for a while. Again, it's great to see us utilising the loan system, especially using clubs in Spain; playing against the very best is a priceless learning experience.

##The academy:

**Liverpool U21s** -- The U21s returned to attack after a prolonged winter break with a very tough match away to a strong Arsenal side consisting of the likes of Frimpong, Jenkinson and Oxlade-Chamberlain. Unfortunately, the game wasn't televised, so I haven't been able to see the goals but I do know Ngoo (2), Smith and Peterson were the scorers.

**Liverpool U18s** -- A U18 side, that was absent from such talents like Sinclair and Chirivella through injury, met Aston Villa at Langtree Park in the FA Youth cup 4th round. Due to this Sergi Canos was called upon to lead the line, with Ojo, Kent and Trickett-Smith behind. U21 pairing Brannagan and Rossiter sat deepest in midfield.  
Liverpool started well, Trickett-Smith and Kent having early opportunities from outside the box. Liverpool made the breakthrough, from a similar chance, too in the 19th minute. Ojo's cross field run broke to Maguire, who pushed forward from left back. He chipped a ball back to Trickett-Smith who took and score a sublime half volley. Soon after, however, Villa were level. They pushed forward on the counter attack and a simple ball into the box caused more problems than it should have. With neither Williams or Randall able to clear, Villa's striker McKirdy poked it in. Villa were on the forefront now, with Ojo giving away a poor pass in his own half, Crump was the only thing stopping McKirdy from making it 2-1 to the away side.  
Wilson replaced Ojo at half time, the Englishman not having the best half all around. Wilson was soon into action, winning a free kick 10 yards outside the area. Although, his attempt floated a yard or so over the bar. Villa were still in this, no doubt about it, and they emphasised that when Jordan Rossiter was forced to clear a header off the line. However, from that clearance Liverpool were able to counter, and it was Harry Wilson at the forefront of the counter attack. After a series of short passes Kent drove down the right and delivered Wilson with the ball. Although Canos and Trickett-Smith were open in the area, Wilson only had one thought in his mind. He cut onto his left foot and placed the ball into the bottom left corner. Liverpool regained the lead.  
Liverpool finished the tie off superbly, with what was Ryan Kent's second assist and Harry Wilson's second goal of the game. Maguire pressurised down the left hand side forcing the ball the break the Ryan Kent. Kent did brilliantly to beat two men, and shake off a third. Next, he played a inch perfect through ball to find Wilson. From that point on, the rest was a given. Wilson left two Villa players on their arses and again slotted into the bottom left corner. [\[GIF of Wilson's second goal here\]](
Wilson almost finished off his hat trick when Kent, again, got it to him. However, his right footed shot was saved well. Final score, 3-1 Liverpool. [\

The U18s were soon back in action, with a 5-0 win away to Blackburn. In a game where Neil Critchley made a surprising 9 changes, with only Sheyi Ojo and Sergi Canos retaining their starting places from mid-week.  
Liverpool were off to a flyer when Wilson played a lovely one-two with Sergi Canos, although his shot was saved well. Liverpool continued to play well, and made the breakthrough in the 10th minute with Sergi Canos intercepting the ball, playing in Ojo who smashed the ball into the top left corner with his left foot. Blackburn responded well, earning a free kick which resulted in a shot Firth was forced to save. Ojo drove forward down the left hand side, continued to look like Liverpool's biggest threat and won a corner. It was from that resulting corner of which Liverpool went 2-0 up. Marsh delivered a curling corner and Cleary finished it with a well placed header. Soon after, Blackburn's Jack Doyle was fortunate to not be sent off for a potentially leg breaking tackle. Liverpool didn't let this deter them. Ojo, again, driving forward down the left delivered a great ball to Canos who placed the ball in to make it 3-0. Liverpool were in full stride now, with left back Sam Hart striding forward, he opened up play. Eventually, the ball came to Wilson on the left, and as he beat his made and drove into the box he was fouled and won a penalty. Wilson slotted his penalty in to again score. Half time and it was 4-0 to Liverpool.   
Liverpool got their 5th before have time when Ojo was set clean through. He slotted past the 'keeper to further extend the lead. Blackburn looked more threatening, forcing Firth into making of impressive saves. Liverpool held on to their clean sheet to complete a superb performance. What was most impressive, was Ojo's performance. He bounced back extremely well after a poor spell midweek. Wilson continued to look much better than his age suggests, such an impressive talent. Canos seems to be settling in well, taking the chance of Sinclair's absence by the horns. Final score, 5-0 Liverpool. [\[Highlights of Liverpool U18s 5-0 win here\]]

##Loans

**Suso at Almeria** -- As predicted, Suso had a major chance to impress in his favoured position of attacking midfield as Almeria met Racing in a home Copa del Rey second leg tie. Suso played 90 minutes in the game, of which Almeria unfortunately lost 2-0. A poor result, albeit against a better team, but Suso will be disappointed the not having made more of an impact. As of now, his best position looks out on the right wing where it is less likely he will doubled up on.  
Despite having played a major part in the recent Copa games Suso is still unfavoured in terms of a starting La Liga place. Although, he is beginning to weed his way back into contention. This time with an appearance in Almeria's tough game away to a in-form Villarreal, Suso came on at half time with the score 1-0 to the home side but wasn't able to make a significant impact as they lost 2-0.

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Coady was disappointingly dropped to the bench for Sheffield United's home game vs Bradford, and was only able to make a very late substitute appearance. Although, it's disappointing to see Coady dropped, it proved an effective change as Sheffield drew 2-2 after two poor loses.

**Krisztián Adorján at Groningen** -- Adorjan and Groningen finally returned to action after their winter break as they drew 1-1 away to Waalwijk. Adorjan played a important role in attacking midfield, although he was sacrificed for defender Lorenzo Burnet when Groningen went down to 10 men. Leading at the time of this substitution, the man advantage helped Waalwijk as they grabbed a late equaliser.

**Pepe Reina at Napoli** -- Reina was absent again, through recovering from injury, as Napoli drew disappointingly with Bolonga due to a last minute equaliser. The game saw Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon give Napoli the lead after previously being 1-0 down. However, Ronlando Bianchi's literal last kick of the game goal, for then 10 men Bolonga, saw Napoli chance of the Scudetto slip further away.

**Jack Robinson at Blackpool** -- Robinson came up against Barnsley are their new addition in Ryan McLaughlin as Blackpool recorded their 4th consecutive loss. Again, there's little I can say about Blackpool. They show no sign of improving, and with questions of manager Paul Ince's future there could be further turmoil. **Update:** Paul Ince has today been sacked. Not really too surprising. Hopefully Robinson retains his place.

**Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City** -- Assaidi returned to Stoke's line up as they met bottom placed Crystal Palace. An easy fixture on paper, but Palace were determined and superb. With Assaidi coming off at the 70th minute, he wasn't able to perform to the level he was prior to a few weeks ago, and Stoke ultimately lost the game 1-0.

**Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC** -- Borini was pivotal to Sunderland turning around a tough game to Southampton. The in-form southerners were 2-0 up when [Borini got his sliced goal](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/fan_shot_images/317665/iCFvMYz54FJyv.gif). Borini continued to play well and Sunderland bagged a equaliser in the second half. They even continued to push on and looked close to getting a winner, with Borini scoring another only for it to be ruled out for offside.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Derby got back to winning ways with a tight 1-0 win against Brighton, Wisdom as always starting at right back. However, Wisdom was taken off prior to the goal in the close affair; being taken off for striker Conor Sammon, with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford getting the winner.

**Craig Roddan at Accrington Stanley** -- Roddan wasn't part of Accrington's squad for their 2-1 win against Cheltenham.

**Ryan Mclaughlin at Barnsley** -- Ryan McLaughlin made his Barnsley début directly against fellow Liverpool counterpart Jack Robinson. The right back displayed a number of his skills, highlighting his pace, ability to beat a player and passing ability numerous times. In what is certainly a impressive start, it's good to see McLaughlin finally getting a great chance at senior football after failing to push through to the first team. [\[Individual highlights of McLaughlin here\]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbqIZfU-y4&amp;feature=youtu.be)

**Tiago Ilori at Granada** -- Ilori recently finalised a move to 11th placed La Liga side Granada. With comments from Rodgers coming to light, it is evident a loan move in January has been in the pipe line for a while. Again, it's great to see us utilising the loan system, especially using clubs in Spain; playing against the very best is a priceless learning experience.

##The academy:

**Liverpool U21s** -- The U21s returned to attack after a prolonged winter break with a very tough match away to a strong Arsenal side consisting of the likes of Frimpong, Jenkinson and Oxlade-Chamberlain. Unfortunately, the game wasn't televised, so I haven't been able to see the goals but I do know Ngoo (2), Smith and Peterson were the scorers.

**Liverpool U18s** -- A U18 side, that was absent from such talents like Sinclair and Chirivella through injury, met Aston Villa at Langtree Park in the FA Youth cup 4th round. Due to this Sergi Canos was called upon to lead the line, with Ojo, Kent and Trickett-Smith behind. U21 pairing Brannagan and Rossiter sat deepest in midfield.  
Liverpool started well, Trickett-Smith and Kent having early opportunities from outside the box. Liverpool made the breakthrough, from a similar chance, too in the 19th minute. Ojo's cross field run broke to Maguire, who pushed forward from left back. He chipped a ball back to Trickett-Smith who took and score a sublime half volley. Soon after, however, Villa were level. They pushed forward on the counter attack and a simple ball into the box caused more problems than it should have. With neither Williams or Randall able to clear, Villa's striker McKirdy poked it in. Villa were on the forefront now, with Ojo giving away a poor pass in his own half, Crump was the only thing stopping McKirdy from making it 2-1 to the away side.  
Wilson replaced Ojo at half time, the Englishman not having the best half all around. Wilson was soon into action, winning a free kick 10 yards outside the area. Although, his attempt floated a yard or so over the bar. Villa were still in this, no doubt about it, and they emphasised that when Jordan Rossiter was forced to clear a header off the line. However, from that clearance Liverpool were able to counter, and it was Harry Wilson at the forefront of the counter attack. After a series of short passes Kent drove down the right and delivered Wilson with the ball. Although Canos and Trickett-Smith were open in the area, Wilson only had one thought in his mind. He cut onto his left foot and placed the ball into the bottom left corner. Liverpool regained the lead.  
Liverpool finished the tie off superbly, with what was Ryan Kent's second assist and Harry Wilson's second goal of the game. Maguire pressurised down the left hand side forcing the ball the break the Ryan Kent. Kent did brilliantly to beat two men, and shake off a third. Next, he played a inch perfect through ball to find Wilson. From that point on, the rest was a given. Wilson left two Villa players on their arses and again slotted into the bottom left corner. [\[GIF of Wilson's second goal here\]](http://gfycat.com/WelloffSardonicAlaskanhusky)  
Wilson almost finished off his hat trick when Kent, again, got it to him. However, his right footed shot was saved well. Final score, 3-1 Liverpool. [\[Highlights of the 3-1 win here\]](http://vimeo.com/84277984#at=0)  

The U18s were soon back in action, with a 5-0 win away to Blackburn. In a game where Neil Critchley made a surprising 9 changes, with only Sheyi Ojo and Sergi Canos retaining their starting places from mid-week.  
Liverpool were off to a flyer when Wilson played a lovely one-two with Sergi Canos, although his shot was saved well. Liverpool continued to play well, and made the breakthrough in the 10th minute with Sergi Canos intercepting the ball, playing in Ojo who smashed the ball into the top left corner with his left foot. Blackburn responded well, earning a free kick which resulted in a shot Firth was forced to save. Ojo drove forward down the left hand side, continued to look like Liverpool's biggest threat and won a corner. It was from that resulting corner of which Liverpool went 2-0 up. Marsh delivered a curling corner and Cleary finished it with a well placed header. Soon after, Blackburn's Jack Doyle was fortunate to not be sent off for a potentially leg breaking tackle. Liverpool didn't let this deter them. Ojo, again, driving forward down the left delivered a great ball to Canos who placed the ball in to make it 3-0. Liverpool were in full stride now, with left back Sam Hart striding forward, he opened up play. Eventually, the ball came to Wilson on the left, and as he beat his made and drove into the box he was fouled and won a penalty. Wilson slotted his penalty in to again score. Half time and it was 4-0 to Liverpool.   
Liverpool got their 5th before have time when Ojo was set clean through. He slotted past the 'keeper to further extend the lead. Blackburn looked more threatening, forcing Firth into making of impressive saves. Liverpool held on to their clean sheet to complete a superb performance. What was most impressive, was Ojo's performance. He bounced back extremely well after a poor spell midweek. Wilson continued to look much better than his age suggests, such an impressive talent. Canos seems to be settling in well, taking the chance of Sinclair's absence by the horns. Final score, 5-0 Liverpool.

The media agency is consistently voted one of the top places to work in the UK and the international SEO team is a fast growing and dynamic team within an already successful search organisation.

**Requirements:**  
- Fluency in English, as well as a wealth of writing experience in English (Fluency in another European language above degree level is a massive plus).   
- Being able to communicate in written English is a huge part of the job, therefore any professional writing/creative writing experience is a huge advantage.   
- Knowledge of Microsoft Office suite as well as basic CMS experience and a knowledge of Google products (gmail/drive etc.) is desired.  
 - A basic understanding of online trends is a must.  
 - Analytics experience is a huge plus but not a requirement.  
 - The candidate must be personable, confident and able to express themselves effectively.  
 - The candidate must have a creative flair for online content of all kinds (video, articles, apps, infographics, widgets etc.)

I went to J&amp;S a few weeks ago and tried lots on. The best fit I could find was their BKS range in an XL, however, the build quality was fucking abysmal. I could pull it apart with my bare hands. 

Does anyone else have a similar problem finding the right size? I know we all have different shape/size heads but is anyone that's had a similar problem able to relate and offer a brand that was perfect for them? Somewhere for me to start next...

A few questions for the sub:

1. What is your definition of success in this match? Do we need to win outright? Is a draw ""success""? What about merely keeping the match close? What about if we're deeply outplayed but only lose 0-1? Is that better or worse than playing very well but being very unlucky in a 0-4 loss? I guess the point here is outcome versus process, and to what extent we privilege either.

2. What tactics would you adopt and how would you approach the game? Clearly this is contingent upon which players return from injury, but for the sake of argument let's just say that all the players listed in the sidebar as January 29 are indeed available. 

3. What do you think Sherwood will do? (This may or may not be different from your approach, but I think it's useful to distinguish.)

4. What's your predicted outcome, and how important is this match in the big picture? Do you put a lot of stock in being able to get something positive?

Another week, another re-shuffle among the top four, although the current lineup is actually back to what it was two rounds ago. Interestingly, **ThePlays** in fifth and **Metalingus FC** in sixth haven't moved at all for bloody ages now - that's six and nine rounds respectively that they've held those particular spots. Can't say they're not consistent. A solid 61 from **The AlmightyFloaters** sees them return to the top ten after a lengthy absence and the recent resurgence of **Joey Barton's Visa** continues as they jump into seventh place.

Absolutely *no* teams recorded their personal-best positions this week, so I *really* don't have much to write about. Thanks, everyone. Theveryone.

####Biggest movers:
**Brendan rodgers boys** showed the most improvement, their league-best score of 81 took them up nine places to 50th, with **Maddogs** following them closely by jumping six spots to 52nd. No team dropped by more then five places this week, with **Baines on Toast** and **FC Monty** sharing that particular ignominy. Considering the former only scored 30 points, that slide is no surprise.

It's the FA Cup this weekend, so we'll be back with more exciting imaginary action after the midweek fixtures. You can still join the league with the code code **375561-306516**, and you can check out your team's past positions with [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak5ieGUOod7fdDJaV0RmYzB2YVBiZk96VGxDMlQtN3c#gid=0).

* Jack Grealish remarkably shook off the effects of this [horror tackle](https://vine.co/v/hljDaLgA30M) (he's really been targeted lately) to start for Notts County away to Peterborough. By the 16th minute Notts were 2-0 and had a man sent off, Grealish didn't do anything particularly spectacular in the first half, got booked for time wasting. Peterborough went 3-2 up but Grealish [scored the equaliser for 3-3](https://twitter.com/Official_NCFC/status/425740395713011712). Here's a [comment](https://twitter.com/BBCCambsSport/status/425739103351480320) from the journalists that cover Peterborough that reinforces the view of most that have watched him in recent weeks - he's a very talented young player. Unfortunately for Notts the crazy game ended 4-3 to Peterborough.


* Samir Carruthers started for MK Dons away to Crewe, hoping to build on impressive form against Wigan and Bristol City. Carruthers seemed to play pretty well, he [smashed the bar](https://twitter.com/MKDonsFC/status/425720446135177216) early on before having a [shot saved](https://twitter.com/MKDonsFC/status/425720731087810560).

###Match facts: Head-to-head

* Manchester City have lost none of their last eight meetings with West Ham in all competitions.
City's 6-0 victory in the first-leg was the joint-biggest win in League Cup semi-final history - West Ham were also on the end of the other six-goal defeat when they lost 6-0 to Oldham in 1990.
* Manchester City met West Ham once in the League Cup back in 1984, beating the Hammers 2-1 in a replay at Upton Park after a goalless draw at Maine Road.
* Both clubs were semi-finalists in 1964 and 2011, with West Ham losing to the eventual winners on both occasions.
Manchester City strikers Alvaro Negredo and Sergio Aguero have both scored 21 goals each this season in all competitions - one fewer than West Ham's squad have managed in total in the Premier League this season.

[Blog #1](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/17/inside-default-web-blocking-part-1/) [Blog #2](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/18/inside-default-web-blocking-part-2/)

But I think the blog format is poor so I summarise below:

* [Alcohol](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/17/inside-default-web-blocking-part-1/#Alcohol%20and%20Tobacco) blocking fails due to the campaigns being targeted at https enabled social media platforms
* [Blocking filesharing](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/17/inside-default-web-blocking-part-1/#File%20Sharing) blocks all file hosting sites including sourceforge - but not actual P2P filesharing of course
* [Gambling](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/17/inside-default-web-blocking-part-1/#Gambling) is blocked. Except on Sky which has a gambling division and doesn't even offer the option to block it.
* [Games](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/17/inside-default-web-blocking-part-1/#Games) blocking fails to block https-enabled social media sites. Manages to block app stores and critical application patching however. Insecurity FTW!
* [Sky blocks bulling](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/17/inside-default-web-blocking-part-1/#Cyberbullying) via magic fairy dust not available to competing ISPs
* Despite much fanfare, [Pro-ana content](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/18/inside-default-web-blocking-part-2/#Pro-Ana%20Content) not blocked at all. Government actually realising complexities here? Surprising result
* [Sex-ed](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/18/inside-default-web-blocking-part-2/#Sex%20Education) block works, knocks out LGBT content, still fails
* [Web-blocking circumvention](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/18/inside-default-web-blocking-part-2/#Web%20Blocking%20Circumvention) turned on by stealth on BT once base level of filtering enabled. Makes incredibly half-arsed attempt to block VPN sites
* [Esoteric material](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/18/inside-default-web-blocking-part-2/#Esoteric%20Material) block attempt by government to block cult websites without actually introducing legalisation to define cults. Like pro-ana content blocking, not actually implemented
* [Extremism and Terrorism](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/18/inside-default-web-blocking-part-2/#Extremist%20Terrorist%20Material) not yet blocked as that is a separate programme to expend the scope of CTIRU to roll out existing block list not yet implemented

It's a mess of a system, most of which outright fail to work and where it partially works often raises further issues. Analysis illustrates the duplicity of government advocates.

While my friends pick the big, gaudy clubs like United or Chelsea, I think my heart's landed with Everton. Here in the States, there aren't many Everton fans, but the few I've crossed paths with were nothing but friendly. They weren't dicks about how this club was the end-all be-all of the football world; they just wanted to share ideas about the game. Seeing that, I decided to give the team a try. After watching a good amount of games this past season, I can genuinely say that I love the way these guys play. Classy, but not so flashy that I get physically angry. 

With all that being said, I don't really know that many fans, so I don't have many people to talk to regarding thoughts on players, formations, managerial situations, etc. So, does anyone have anything to share with a budding fan?",false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,null,null,self,"New to following the team, any thoughts you want to share?",12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Everton/comments/1vtdtj/new_to_following_the_team_any_thoughts_you_want/

Just wanted to talk about a small thing that's been bothering me: the wardrobe issue.

In season 1 (episode 3), when The Doctor took Rose to the 19th century and they met Charles Dickens, he gave her directions on how to get to a certain closet in the TARDIS (revealing, by his directions, just how massive it actually is on the inside) where she could find a dress that would help her blend in with everyone else in the 1800s.

Then in season 2 (episode 2), they accidentally happen upon Queen Victoria and all those people exclaim over Rose's ""nakedness"" because, since it was an accident, she didn't change into proper attire.

Now, in season 3, The Doctor has taken Martha Jones to both 1599 and the 30s, and she's wearing the exact same thing--a low-cut shirt, leather jacket, and tight jeans. He doesn't bother to let her change into something more time-appropriate, doesn't even mention it, and none of the people during those times even notice, except for when Shakespeare commented that they were ""tight-fitting."" But no one finds it odd that a woman is not only wearing pants, but *tight jeans.* It's just been bothering me, because this is the kind of show that's usually consistent and explains everything. Martha just walking around God-knows-when in 21st century clothing seems like something the Doctor would view as a serious no-no, or at least address.

So I was just hoping to get everyone else's thoughts on this.

**JACK OF ALL TRADES, MASTER OF ALL**

In almost every single episode, with few exceptions such as *Midnight*, the Doctor has both practical and theoretical knowledge of every situation he finds himself in. He is supremely adaptable, as evidenced by his ability to use his sonic screwdriver to ~~put up whatever cabinet is required~~ take exquisite advantage of subtle opportunities. One wonders whether he was the inspiration for the Greek goddess [Athena](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena); of all the ancient deities, who else embodies the Doctor's resourcefulness? Not only is he exceptionally learned, he still maintains an immortal wonder and scholarship for the universe.

**VIRTUE**

He feels love, but does not stray into jealousy. He feels anger, but does not act upon it. He feels pity, but does not condescend. He shows mercy, but prepares judgement for the unrepentant. He recognizes that forgiveness is not the key to the shackles of guilt, but to the shackles of hatred. He does not content himself with a good solution, but strives to see the best way forward. He is courageous enough to threaten a Dalek fleet with a pastry. He does not revenge, even though none would blame him. And he always answers pleas for aid, even at his mortal peril. He is humble enough to consider the trade of a couple centuries of existence for a paltry few decades as more than fair.

**PEOPLE; HOW DO THEY WORK?**

Any one of these characteristics would amass him an army of followers, but it is empathy that gives him irresistibly polarizing charisma. His mercy in victory has even recruited his [former enemies:](#s ""Madam Vastra, Novice Hame, et al"") and his willingness to imperil his own life alongside complete strangers has inspired reciprocity. The mention of his name can resurrect hope and tremble invasions; here is a man who can stand tall on the front lines, lock eyes with every form of death, defend himself only with an instrument of peace, and **win**.

**THIS POST WAS ORIGINALLY ABOUT *ME*, YOU KNOW...**

So how does the Doctor inspire me, personally? I am a student, currently working towards a Master's degree in Mathematics. To be a Doctor would require me to give something back to humanity, to enrich us all in some mathematical way. Perhaps I cannot do this; but there are other ways to be like the Doctor.

 - I could (and have) become a teacher; take on my own companions and show them the wonders of the Universe. Never should the day come when I grow weary of new ideas, or contemptuous of familiar ones; for in that day I should become unworthy of my mastery.

 - I should choose my career with wisdom. Let the conqueror draw his own plans, let the miser count his own coin, let the swindler find his own mark, let the corrupt craft his own lie. I will build [engines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_confinement_fusion) that  move people forward, [ideas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations) that help them dream, [elegant stratagems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(complexity\)) that help them save, [art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem) that makes them think, and [wonders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program) that give them hope.

The Doctor's greatest gift is the secret of his name.

That space is reserved for *your* name, for *all our names*. It is the question that must never be answered, because if it is, silence will fall. No more effort made to become the Doctor, to transcend our own expectations of ourselves, no more progress; just the hope that someone else will help us, someone else who is the Doctor will come to save us.

I have seen that guy from Benfica Djuricic play a few times, he looks good and plays with good pace but i am not usre if this is just speculation. Benfica have said we have not made an approach for him. 
Without doubt we need to spend in this window to get the new players ready for CL qualification, we need a striker and at least one midfielder. 
Defoe would have been a great signing but I am not sure if he would come to Scotland and I don think we could afford his wages

Some guys might not like this but I would cash in on Forster (if anyone from the premiership is silly enough to buy him) and buy with the money we get for him.

Here is the final doc (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AnbRX76-rFRIdFlDUVhpZlNQbC1qOHdIbk1yX0M5ZHc&amp;output=html ) 

Some key points

* 4th is the best position we can have after this round, 6th is the worst
* 73.28% chance that we will stay at 4th 
* 16.5% chance that we will drop to 5th
* 10.66% chance that we will drop to 6th 
* There is also a 25% chance that next week the probability of us being 4th will be 100% ( If we win and City win away )

Furthermore at what point does it become better to buy cheaper bulbs? Given the price of some of the LEDs I'm seeing I can't imagine they'd pay for themselves in savings, so to speak.

What do you think, is it worth it \ necessary?

Not in a literal beat you up sense, but more walking up to me and asking me directly for change. I don't mean they just sit down on the side of the street and beg, but walk up to and directly address me. This will sound terribly selfish, but it is very annoying when trying to go about my day to be directly asked for change several times on a 1 mile walk to the library. Are there not local services for them?

I'm from Sydney Australia and I'm going to be in the UK for about a week to visit.

I'm a Bitcoin enthusiast and I attend the Sydney Bitcoin Meetup religiously every week.

I've been to the UK plenty of times, and each time I go I would go to an ATM and take out GBP using my Australian Debit Card. This incurs horrible bank fee's, ATM fees, and my bank screws me on 2.5% lower currency exchange rates :(

Alas! Bitcoin!

I was hoping someone could help me exchange my AUD to GBP using Bitcoins!? :)
I'm looking for about ~600GBP spending money, and was hoping someone could meet up with me and I could trade you the appropriate Bitcoin for GPB at the current market rate/exchange rate? :)

I land in the UK on Saturday 25th of January at ~5am, and I have a train from London Paddington to Exeter at 9am. Would someone be able to come meet me at Starbucks or something at Paddington Station at ~8am? I know this is kind of an early hour for a Saturday, but I do have to be on my train by 9am.
Also, I would need to borrow some Wifi from either Starbucks or tether some internet from you :)

* **3 - South Ham via Saurum Hill** - Split off from the old 3. West Popley end moved on to the new 6. Now goes via BCoT instead of Winchester Road.
* **4/A - Town Loop** - Slight change to the route in South Ham and Worting.
* **6 - Winklebury &amp; East Popley** - The last remaining cross-town route. East Popley end of old 3 tacked onto existing 6 route.
* **7 - Chineham** - Split off from the old 1. Same route to town, now every 15 minutes instead of 12.
* **8 - Kempshott via Buckskin** - Combination of the old 1 and 8. Takes the fast route via Churchill Way and Kempshott Lane, but takes the long way around Hatch Warren to get to Sainsburys.
* **11 - Oakley** - Split off from the old 8, goes via Winchester Rd and Buckskin. Now hourly instead of every 20 minutes. 
* **12 - Kempshott via Brighton Hill** - Sweeps up the places left behind by the removal of the old 1 and 7.

I am trying to deposit into bitstamp with an international transfer here: https://www.bitstamp.net/account/deposit/bank/international/

I am presented with the following page: http://i42.tinypic.com/xnwyna.png

I assume since bitstamp trades bitcoins for $$$ I will need to select the dollar option? Can anyone confirm if this is correct?

So lets say I select the dollar option, I will then be presented with this page: http://i39.tinypic.com/2rg2eqb.png

So do I then log onto my bank account and do an international wire transfer of my preferred amount to the info provided in the picture I just linked

Account owner:	Bitstamp LIMITED
Address:	5 J. House, Calleva Park, Aldermaston
City:	Reading, Berkshire RG7 8NN
Country:	United Kingdom
Account number:	0000170073837
IBAN:	SI56290000170073837
Bank name:	Unicredit banka Slovenija d.d.
Address:	Smartinska 140
City:	1000 Ljubljana
Country:	Slovenia
BIC (SWIFT):	BACXSI22

This bank appears to be in the UK so if I send it dollars will it accept dollar deposits and credit these dollars to my account?

What if due to changing conversion fees less dollars turn up than I intended to send, will bitstamp just credit my account with the dollars that turn up or does it have to be the exact amount I specified?

I was hoping I could just throw dollars at an account using my unique reference number and they would be credited to my account when bitstamp staff get around to it.

Any help would be apreciated guys, how the hell do you get money to bitstamp since transferwise stopped allowing cryptocurrency transfers?

I think he's one of the best young midfielders in the world right now, but there are very obvious holes in his game that could bite us in the ass later on if he's all we have to rely on. 

I'm afraid that this reads like a long criticism of Oscar, but that's not what I intend it to be. I just want us to examine the pros and cons of having Oscar as our #10. Here the cons are bolded and the pros are mostly absent, so please feel free to put them in the comment. 


I'll summarize my main points below:

* **He's not a traditional #10:** Unlike Mata or say Xavi, he cannot slow down the game when we need to. If for example, we have a flimsy lead and the opponents are charging, it'll be a great time to hold on to the ball in midfield just so the opponents don't have it. Mata could help us retain possession, Oscar can help us win it, but retention isn't his thing.

* **He's too generous on the ball:** To the opponent that is. His pass completion rate is average and he concedes too many interceptions. I think he and Willian gives the ball away more than anyone on the squad. That may not always be a problem as we have enough cover in that case, but it certainly reduces the amount of chances we can create in each game.

* **His vision isn't Great:** Obviously, he sees very clearly, but I'm not convinced in his ability to see chances no one else can. Mata makes these defense-splitting passes that must either get intercepted or will lead to a goal-scoring chance. Oscar rarely even attempts these passes. I don't think that's because he lacks confidence; Oscar has lots of confidence. But there are two kinds of players in this world: Those who sees chances like that and the ones who don't. I think that Oscar falls in the latter category.

* **Set pieces:** I read somewhere that the best teams convert one in 4 or 5 corners. With Mata, we're close to that, but without him, we're very far off. Oscar's corners rarely get converted. Most of the time they can't even beat the first man.

* **He's wasteful on the counter:** On paper, this isn't necessarily true because he has pace and good ball control which always help with counter attacks, but I feel like he often makes the wrong decision when we're on the counter. The best counter-attacking teams like Real and Dortmund will score if you give them more than one chance at a 3V2 counter attack in a game, but I don't think that is necessarily true for us.

* **He's like Lampard, but not quite**: I think his role is comparable to 2004 Lampard back when we were playing Duff and Robben as wingers with Lamps right between them. Oscar is faster than Lamps, which his good, he had better dribbling too and there are a number of things he does better now at 22 than Lamps who was 26 at that time, but Passing and Shooting aren't one of those things and those, in my book are the most important qualities.

* **He can't jump-start things:** Whenever we're struggling to create something in attack, I feel like Oscar disappears into a defensive cover. It seems like in those times, all I see is Hazard taking on men, maybe drawing a foul and trying to get us back into attacking form. That should be Oscar's Job.

Obviously a lot of people will disagree with a number of points I've made here, but please try to do more than just disagree. Let's hear your counter-argument. Whether or not I like it, Oscar is our #10 now, therefore as a Chelsea fan, the more of these points you can convince me I'm wrong about, the better I'll feel.

BTW, I'm still in deep denial on this whole Mata thing. Our board will go to bed tonight mulling over this apparent bid from United, but the sun will rise in London tomorrow and they'll wake the fuck up and realize they're about to make a massive fucking mistake.

Is anyone here looking for accommodation for the Autumn/Spring terms 2014-2015? 

My friend and I are looking for two housemates to join us in a house in Hales Place, Canterbury. We'll both be 22 and going into our final year, so graduate students may find this suitable. We lived with two guys last year so are more than happy to have this arrangement again. 

 The house is a comfortable 15 min. walk from the UKC campus in a quiet residential area. We have two single rooms: one is downstairs with a door to the back yard, which is ideal for smokers. There’s also a downstairs toilet for convenience. The other room is upstairs, and rent for each room is £325 per month. The deposit is £300, and you would be required to pay half rent during July and August (this is, unfortunately, a standard request from Canterbury landlords it seems). 

Both bedrooms are equipped with desks and desk lamps, a chest of drawers, a bookcase, and a clothing closet.

Our landlady is extremely helpful and has always been prompt and fair when dealing with household problems. There are no ‘admin’ fees that you get with going through companies because we deal directly with her. Bills are not included but last year we shared the bills between us and it was always very reasonable, although I don't know the exact cost per person.

We're friendly, laid back, enjoy a drink or two and like going out from time to time, so would prefer to live with people who have similar interests. We did lots of things together as a house last year (e. g. playing guitar, watching films), so would love to recreate that very relaxed environment.

We're both in the USA at the moment (we lived in this house last year though), but we can Skype/Email to your heart's content. 

Thanks for reading!

I've done my best to, and pasted it here for opinions. I'm worried, because I keep hearing how ATOS likes to make examples of people with mental health problems, and I don't want the attachment letter to come across like I'm shirking responsibility, but instead hopefully communicate to the assessor that I am in no way ready for work when you consider my physical and mental issues.

""I thought out of a matter of prudence, I should write down a more comprehensive list of my issues as they’ve developed, frustrations, and what, specifically hinders me. In doing so, I feel that had ATOS not previously misjudged my condition entirely, I might not be as bad as many say I am now; at the very least, I believe it would be fair to say I would at least be functional in today’s society and making a decent effort of trying to piece my life back together.

So what’s wrong with me? To list physical encumbrance, I am severely unhealthy; I am overweight, my blood pressure the last three times I’ve had it checked have sat comfortably in the 110/180 mark, and I barely sleep. I have incontinence issues; I often find myself having wet the bed at night after waking up from night terrors, and during the day, my bowel movements result in excessive gas issues, and excreta escaping in an often fluid form. I would state that if I had the money, I would ensure that I had at least one clean pair of shorts, but I cannot afford regular laundry, and certainly not on the level of changes that would be required to keep a clean, functional appearance in the workplace. 

I can no longer touch my toes without severe ache, and standing up takes effort. Even for the shortest of times, I experience sharp pain in my lower back, and find that I have to sit down to ease the pain – even then, I have constant lower back pain that requires medication on a regular basis for temporary respite. As for walking, this…More or less is currently out of the question. I can make it to the end of my road (about 100 metres from where I’m currently sitting) without feeling extreme discomfort in my lower back, and will find that I’m out of breath, and require a rest for a few minutes when I reach the school gates, which I estimate to be less than ten metres away.

My cupboards are mounted, but I will often place any food I’m likely to use in the short term on the lower shelves, and largely use a microwave as placing food in the oven can be uncomfortable when I bend down for a variety of reasons; sometimes I will experience nothing more than discomfort, but I have been known to lose bowel control, and end up needing to mop up the mess that’s been made.

In addition to all of this, I have an old injury in my wrist that has a recurring ache; painkillers don’t help, and I've minimised any usage I have with my PC to simply watching DVDs or talking with one of my few friends and family on skype.

All of this, it must be said, are physical ailments. In addition to this, my mental state has worsened exponentially over the past few years; my behaviour has become ever more erratic and paranoid, to the degree that I no longer leave the house if I can avoid it – I steer well clear of populated areas such as the city centre, never even contemplate leaving my home the moment it starts to get dark, and generally, if I need to go somewhere, will opt for a taxi as it minimises my chances of coming into contact with multiples groups of people – which brings me to a list of why.

If I had to label the major phenomena of what happens when I’m experiencing anxiety, I would say that it is a state of hyper vigilance; Noises are frighteningly loud for me, everything is brighter; I can only best describe the feeling that if someone were to place a dial on my senses, my normal day would consist of a 3, and when I step out of a door, the dial is increased to at least a 9…And then Hallucinations begin. I will often “see” people decomposing as I walk down the road, which only serves to heighten my anxiety; in fairness, I will often try my best to cope until I can reach a place that I feel is safe, but an inability to find somewhere that I feel is safe will often result in me becoming erratic, panicked and even violent and disruptive – if it persists, family members have known me to simply find a quiet corner and become quite catatonic. My breathing becomes laboured, and I struggle for air even more than I usually do so.

On the rare occasions where I’ve been asked to hand in a sick note to the job centre, or go to the doctor, I will seek the quietest place I possibly can; the job centre, while looking at me with an element of confusion and probable revulsion from my body odour, will often place me in a side cubicle until I am called. At the doctor’s surgery, I will generally find a seat and focus on something on the floor; if someone sits next to me, I’ll move, and this triggers anxious feelings; I’ll start to get twitchy, I’ll bite my nails, but I’ll remain quiet at all times – if other people come into the waiting room, I will usually spend a good portion of my time moving from space to space, so as to avoid any possibility of contact with people.

All of this of course, is entirely dependent upon my ability to leave the house in the first place; because of erratic sleep patterns (I am known to go anywhere between a period of one and three days without sleep, and then enter a period of Hypersomnia; this makes me extremely unreliable for appointments, impossible to arrange a schedule to, and it depresses me more because so far in 37 years of life, there appears to be nothing I can do; I force myself to stay awake often because of nightmares that stem from a childhood of being beaten and sexually abused, to then sleeping so much that I will wake up to find myself in a puddle of my own urine and/or excreta. This, as you can imagine, would be enough to make any man my age feel low, but when I combine this with an already depressed state, I honestly judge myself to be quite a pathetic creature, unworthy of being loved or wanted in any significant way. My days are spent alone, with the exception of the few times when people call me for bill payments or during the course of correspondence.

To make this worse, I haven’t had a proper shower for nearly two years, through a mixture of a lack of desire to place any effort on a day to day order and simply being unable to afford to. I have spent two winters struggling to keep warm, which has only served to worsen my state of mind, and while I publicly maintain that I am fiercely and extremely private as a person (which, in all fairness I am) and will attribute this to being the reason why I don’t allow people in my flat, the real reason is that I am for all intents and purposes non-functioning. I don’t clean up after myself most the time, and the worst part is I don’t care to. Tidying up has no meaning, because I’m quite content now to just let life pass me quietly by – I have, in all conventional meanings of the term, given up. I feel a certain degree of shame in acknowledging that not only do I wait for death, I welcome it – because then I would no longer have to worry about how insignificant I am, and that in order to live in a life that’s filled with nothing but bills, misery and pain I have to beg a completely anonymous person for enough money to be able to afford to eat more than my current diet of beans of toast, and to afford even a modicum of a quality of life. To be clear on this point…I have no vices. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t take drugs, and a part of me that fights to live wants to be a functioning member of society; Despite my numerous problems, if someone asked me for help in a way that I’m able to, I would gladly do so, if only to break up the tedium; but the part of my mind that wants that, and the reality of who I am in this moment are two separate things entirely; please don’t make me go to work right now. I’m not ready for it, and the idea of being around just one person I don’t know fills me with dread and fear in ways that I doubt you could barely comprehend. I obsess over the smallest of details, and worry that it might result in the very worst outcome possible. And then I consider all the other variables, and this could all stem from simply being asked how I am today.

 I would say that over the past two years, I anticipate death, and think about taking my life between three and four times a week, and will often find myself attempting to take my life on a semi regular basis.

Between myself and my partner we earn a combined £40k - my bank are willing to lend me £200k based on that and my credit rating.

I rent a one bedroom flat for £680 a month, and I can see that over a long term (35 to 40) I could make the payments no issue. I've been given an inital 2 year fixed offer at 4.89%. 

My plan at the minute is to look at property around £170k and take as long a term as I can (40) but overpay by as much as possible.

I have access to a £17k Trust fund which I can use as deposit.

Does this sound sensible? Im 23 so taking something out over 40 years seems a big thing to get my head around.

It appears he has been able to overcome Chelsea's initial refusal to sell to league rivals and is seemingly on his way to Man United. 

It seems as though everyone this year has overlooked Man U as a future club to contend with despite the past few years success. There were rumblings of a possible bid for Mata in the beginning of the season; however, thoroughly rebuked by Chelsea if they proved to be true. 

It is difficult for clubs to plan for such instances when a quality key player is unsettled and looking for a move, particularly in a position of strength and numbers. Whereas other key areas are in need of strengthening, both immediately and looking at seasons ahead, is it worth it to compete for a player such as Mata?

Have Spurs missed out? Would Tottenham, whose midfield is already overcrowded with players, some even publicly unsettled, have benefited from the addition of Mata?

Obviously Lloris is hands down our starter for the foreseeable future. He's world class and we are extremely lucky to have him.  


After that, we know that Papa Brad wants to coach and I've heard Columbus Crew thrown around.  From what i recall he is retiring from play this summer or at least that's a tentative time.


And then there's Gomes who I think we can all agree has had his time in a Spurs shirt.  I assume that when his contract is up, at the latest, he's out as well.  


Unless I'm mistaken, that leaves us with Archer.  I don't know a lot about the youth squad personally, but I don't think that he's regarded as a world-beater or anything of that sort.  So are we in for a new keeper this summer? I don't think its pressing enough to hunt for one in January (which i officially started pronouncing as ""Yanuary"" last season, just thought I'd share that.)

Does anyone here live at Horniman House, or know people who do?
Pictures and some sharing would be so greatly appreciated.

Cheers

The problem is, according to Royal Mail the address doesn't exist. The issue is that it's a house with four flats in it. The house number and the road name come up without a problem, but none of the flats.

This means that I'm having trouble changing my addresses as they all seem to use Royal Mail's information.

Do you know if there's a way to get the flat added to their records? This must be the case for the other three flats too and it seems a bit silly.


EDIT: Just got a reply from the Royal Mail. Because there is only one collection point for post in the building (i.e. in the main hall), they only have it registered as one address. If each flat had a separate post box, they'd have each one registered individually. So hopefully that won't cause problems.

We have been targeting Salah for months and we all knew we were interested in him before January.

 
Do questions have to be asked of the transfer committee and whether we can get players in quicker?

 
Yes Coutinho, Sturridge were very good/cheap purchases, but there have also been a lot of players we have missed out on because we are so reluctant to up the bid etc.

 
Shouldn't this Salah deal have been tied up earlier in the transfer window? This would have more than likely given him more game time with us and also stopped a bid from Chelsea(although we don't know this)


Also a raising concern from us Liverpool supporters is the defensive midfield position, with Lucas out for a couple of months this could be a problem.

 
We do have Joe Allen as cover to play there but he has been injury prone this season, and what if he were to get injured? We would be without a DM and would suffer against all the big teams defensively

Surely we have to be getting a defensive midfielder in before the end of the window, yes there is time but it looks unlikely that anyone is going to sell the type of quality we need in that position.

Yesterday, when I was just leaving job and heading home I saw one of the most strange and awesome things I've ever seen. I was walking St. Andrew Square when I started to hear a loud hissing noise, like some gas from a valve. At the other side of the square I saw some kind of truck (like the garbage truck) with something similar to a (really) big flare in its rear part. As I came closer, I started realizing that there were two men working near the truck. Ok, the thing is one of them was  holding some kind of hose with the handle flaring. You know, like all red as if it had fire inside it. The guy was pointing the hose at the floor and smoke went out of the surface that the guy ""cleaned"". 

Have you ever seen something similar to this? Do you know what the hell was that and what is the exact purpose of the ""flaring cleaning truck""?

In the book, Ramit suggests allocating income like this:

* 50-60% fixed costs (rent, bills, subscriptions, etc)
* 10% investments (401k, Roth IRA in his case)
* 5-10% savings goals (holidays, mortgage deposit, gifts, etc)
* 20-35% 'guilt-free' spending money

I currently allocate my income something like this, but I wonder if I should allocate more to investments/pensions:

* Fixed costs 45% (I included groceries &amp; travel in my case)
* Company pension 3% (matched by company and before tax so equivalent to 4% after tax)
* Investment fund (S&amp;S ISA) 4%
* Savings goals 20% (house deposit/fees, holiday)
* 25-30% spending money

I also have a business account with them, so the first thing she asked was if my nature of business had changed before questioning the number of incoming credits to my current account, to which I advised her my business hadn't changed and the transactions were completely separate from it, but were in fact related to personal trading with foreign and digital currencies. She asked, ""Bitcoins, right? Tell me about them"".

I was sure this was going to be the dreaded phone call that I wasn't allowed to trade Bitcoins with this account, or that someone had reported a fraudulent transaction, but nope. I explained the ins and outs of them, where I get them, how more and more companies are accepting them as a form of payment (making sure to drop in Virgin Galactic), and how I take my own security precautions by asking for a scan of the bank card and/or ID for trades over a certain amount of GBP.

She was completely cool with it all. I asked if Barclays had or were introducing any policies regarding what I'm doing or Bitcoins in general and she said no, and as far as she knows they have no plan to. She told me to carry on as I am and that if anything ever changes she will notify me.

IF we have bid Chelsea have come in with a bid for Salah (Bid apparently 11 mil or 12.5 mil)

IF this is true and Chelsea are on their way to securing Salah's signature then we have shown how weak we really are.

IF Salah is Rodgers top target then why not just pay the 12 million at the start of the month and be done with the transfer, rather than waiting 22 days to allow other clubs to notice the player is available and snap at a 12 mil price tag (which is relatively cheap considering it is his top target).

It makes no sense to argue with Basel over 2 mil for a player that is considered a top target for us.

I could understand if they were asking for 30 mil and we were trying to get down to 18 million, it's a mere 2 million pound extra.

I am starting to question if Rodgers or FSG really want to push for top.

We almost lost Coutinho to Southampton because we wouldn't pay 10 mil and would only pay 8 mil. Luckily for us we are bigger than Southampton where as this time Chelsea are the bigger club and will succeed in signing him if the rumour is true that they are bidding for Salah!.

I am a law graduate and have done some volunteering for over a year so have some experience under my belt. Ideally, I am looking for work within a charity organisation in an advisory role, customer service role or an admin role but I'm pretty desperate so will take anything (within reason).

I've sent so many online applications but no response.

Everybody keeps telling me to join an agency but I have no clue where to start.

I have googled some agencies online, signed up and submitted my CV via their website but no response yet.

I'm thinking of just going to the city and going door to door at agencies in the hope that somebody will take me seriously, but firstly, I don't know where to start and secondly, I'm worried that they will just tell me to sign up via their website.

Can anybody recommend any good job agencies that actually help? (maybe sit down with you and discuss how they can help - or is this a myth?)

Alternatively, what is the best way to approach a job agency?

Also, any other advice for a job seeker would be much appreciated.

Thanks!

I must say it is one of the best series i've seen. About a year ago i started to hear from my friends how good it is, they posted DW related things on Facebook and i am naturally quite open-minded, so i put it on my imaginary ""To watch"" list, but i did not rush in any way, actually, it was one of my new classmates who gave me needed push.

First episodes were feeling like it was a cheap TV production - it probably was, and i do not complain - and it got better with time. I love series which have consistent universe, and DW satisfied me in this way.

Not everyone may see it same, but i like how they put homosexuality in there every so often - i am not a homosexual or in LGBT community, but i am happy for those people, i support them (of course i like gay jokes and so on, but that is different). I also felt some atheist themes in the series, that was pleasant too. I also very like the Doctor's ""no guns"" policy, it's not something you can see very often today.

On the GrandOldTeam forum this transfer is getting a lot of heat. It's being described as 'unimaginative' and worst of all, 'Simon Davies-esque'.

Personally, if it's a cheap deal, I think he will make great back-up for the central midfield area. He is a player Martinez has worked with extensively and I'm sure if he didn't feel like he could improve our squad, he wouldn't be interested in him. He's 26 years old and it would be nice if we could give McCarthy and Barry a rest once in a while. I'd actually be happy with the signing. One thing I never felt we had under Moyes was a good squad with real depth. These kind of signings will give us a chance to rotate and not exhaust players.

I was saddened by the Mata departure, when my mom and her husband told me that they will buy me a trip to london for a weekend to see Chelsea - Sunderland. This made me incredibly happy, since I've never seen Chelsea and I've never been to London. 

The problem is I'm handicapped. I need to have a wheelchair with me when going around. I can walk up to 100-200 meters and stand for a bit, I'm not totally ""chairbound"". My questions are about London and the stadium. How is it? How adapted for the disables is it? Are there some special seats for the handicapped? I have no issues with sitting on the regular seats, I just thought that maybe I can get some better ones. Are there some bars where there is some kind of a meet-up before? 

I'm truly sorry to bother, but I'm so happy right now and this is a big deal for me!

So in November the fixed term contract I was working ran out and I was not able to secure another job in that time. Whilst looking for work I decided to volunteer my time as a classroom assistant not only to boost my CV but also to prepare for a possible future career in education. So I sign on and go to my first appointment where I have to declare the fact that I'm volunteering and the hours that I'm working. It was under 16 a week so that should've been no problem.

Over the next 2 weeks I attend the appointments at the Jobcentre that are booked in for me and sign on when needed. I carry on volunteering when I can, applying to any jobs I could find and keeping a thorough record of my job search. I haven't been paid by this point but it was still early days. 2 more weeks pass and I still haven't been paid so I take this matter up with my advisor. Apparently the Jobcentre haven't received confirmation that I am volunteering from the school. No worries, I chase it up twice with the head teacher and am told that the form was definitely sent back. I call up to see what is going on with my payment, my advisor gets me to sign a declaration and I'm told I should hear soon.

Flash forward to today. I've managed to secure a permanent position at the previous company I worked for so I've closed my claim and am now working full time. Except I was never paid. Not a single penny. And I don't even get half my normal wages this month because I started so late. And I've had no income since I lost my job. Yesterday I rang the Jobcentre and was told that I'd be called back by 1 today and that my claim is still stuck with the Decision Maker. Having heard nothing by 1, I ring again. I was told I'd be called back in the next hour. Nothing. Call again, told it's been escalated and a team leader will contact me in the hour. Nope. Call again, was told I'd hear before 5. I finish work and still nothing.

So basically I'm completely stuck. I can't seem to talk to anyone at the Jobcentre about the situation and apparently my claim is stuck in limbo. That money would really help with getting to work and paying for other necessities I have but I've been left to struggle. I've paid my taxes for years and the one time I need a bit of help from the government to get me back my feet and I'm completely ignored. There's all this talk of benefit cheats and benefit fraud but I've done everything by the book and have genuinely been trying to get back into work but have been punished for volunteering my time to further my chances of securing a career. I honestly have no idea what to do at this point.

I'm currently in an annoying situation and wondering if anyone has any ideas that could help.

My Wife and I are currently looking into buying our first property, we have a reasonable loan saved up (around 20k at the moment and saving roughly another 1k a month) and my wife has a permanent job on just over 20k/year.

I recently resigned a permanent position which was both low-paid and low-prospect for the opportunity to work for a company I am very enthusiastic about for a much higher salary (24k) and much better opportunities for the future.  The kicker is I'm currently only employed with them on a fixed term contract lasting 10 months (which I'm 2 months into).

Unfortunately, even though I am quite employable, have a decent deposit saved up, live well within our means and have no credit history problems, every Mortgage company I've researched won't consider using my salary for mortgage calculations.
I've been told so far that I either need to make my FTC job permanent, or I need to wait till I've been in contract work for 12 months with another 6 months to go before I would be considered for a mortgage.

I'm hoping someone out there will know about a lender who might be willing to listen to our individual situation rather than just 'helpfully' point out that they would have given me a mortgage no problem if I'd stayed in my old dead-end job.

Thanks in advance!",false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,null,null,self,Advice on getting a FTB Mortgage,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1vymxu/advice_on_getting_a_ftb_mortgage/

* Do you get to do the 3rd year buggy project?
* Would you recommend it here? Why?

Secondly I have some questions on accommodation:

* Stoke Bishop or Clifton? Which is a more 'student area'
* Is the Hawthorns any good?
* Best self-catered hall in your opinion?

I bought a '97 gixxer back in the summer from a friend. I had the carbs cleaned and new diaphragms fitted. When it cam to putting the bike back together, it started and then stalled (put the side stand down). Anyways, after it not starting again due to the immobiliser going tits up I removed it (immobiliser). 

So, here I am, 27 days away from going travelling and I need to sell the bike to help fund this. I have still not figured out why it won't start, but I am certain it will be simple and I just can't figure it out. 

The question I have is this. How do I go about selling this bike while it is technically a non runner, and what would be a fair price. New chain and newish tyres and body is in good condition. I wish I could keep her, but I will be away for 18 months and I am not sure I can fix her with good time to sell. 

Cheers.

These players always seem to come from clubs where they are developing well in first teams, sign for liverpool and come crashing down to earth when they're sent to the U-21s. For all the money spent on them, we can't really be sure that they're any better than the youth players we already have. Even Rodgers doesn't seem to be sure: what was the point signing Alberto if you are going to bring Smith on instead of him as a sub?

The record of these players is no better than the players we've had from a younger age. Flanagan has shown we have no idea how good someone can be until they get a good run of games, so why not give as much of the little time available to players we've had from younger ages, like sterling? Not only would we have the satisfaction of producing homegrown players, but the money spent on 18-21 year olds could have funded the purchase of a 22-25 year old to go straight into the first team, or several younger talents like Sterling or Will Hughes.

The life alert system was incredibly slow to respond and even then when the ambulance arrived they couldn't get in. Eventually my aunt was contacted and drove across London to let them in. He was on the floor for hours.

Are there any systems in place in the uk to make sure this doesn't happen again? Are there any technologies that we can use? I'd hate to have to resort to something like a nanny cam and invade his privacy.",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,self,90 year old grandfather lives alone in a flat in London.

I didn't see the game, but I can imagine that after 3 goals at home, the team wasn't doing much, so I think for Donnelly to make something out of nothing is exactly what we need. We say that he is too young but right now, we need more players. If you look at the premier league, there are much younger players with big roles at the club. For example, Januzaj, Luke Shaw, Lukaku, they all play regularly, and their young age doesn't affect how they play. I think Michael Laudrup really needs to stop substituting Bony off and bringing on Vasquez when he has never proven himself. Donnelly could end up making us a lot of money if he has a solid season with regular playing time. Even if he plays well and we keep him, we have great options for Bony and Michu. If he keeps playing on the youth team, he is never going to get the experience he needs to make it as a young talent in one of the toughest leagues in the world. Since I first heard his name, I wanted him on the pitch, but only in pre season has he had that chance, and he took it so well with the way he was able to play, even if the clubs were not very good.

Any news on Donnelly playing in a premier league match in the near future?

This year, it's opposite. After Chelsea snapped up Mohamed Salah (which I didn't think we needed badly), I am still thinking we need a class defensive midfielder. I know Diame is not a world class, but I have huge admiration for this lad. 

No Salah - no problem. He might have scored 5 or 6 goals until the end of season and I don't think we are that short of goals. We need an Alonso.

Anyway, who do you think we should buy?

What the fire is saying is to try the ""find tickets"" button at [Ticket Link](http://www.chicago-fire.com/tickets/group/SpursSupporters). But if this doesn't work I would suggest calling into the Fire - 888-MLS-Fire. They are also looking at opening up more section as the day goes on but they need to sort out security and other logistics. So hold tight and if the site is working give em a call. 

Sorry this is so frantic. I don't think the Fire expected the demand and response that we have given!But it will all be worth it and Maybe at the tailgate before the game there will be some sort of secret word that if you give it you will get a free shot of Malort. 

If you have already gotten your ticket through a supporters group (Chicago Spurs, New York Spurs, Boston Spurs, etc, etc...) you do not need to order through this link. So if your group has already contacted the fire to reserve your block of tickets you are set. 

This link will direct you to buy a ticket in the Spurs supporters sections 134, 133 and 132. 

The special offer code is Fire.

There are instructions on the link as well. Also the Fire ticket rep who is handling this has his email on the page if you have questions.

And here is the link. [tickets for Spurs supporters]
(http://www.chicago-fire.com/tickets/group/SpursSupporters) 

I can try to help with any other questions or clarifications.

The competition is based around the theme ""Waste of Space"" and is open to any short story or poem with that title. There are separate categories for children (6-11), teens (12-16), and adults. The word limit for short stories is 2000 words.

Submission deadline is January 30th. Find more information about submitting here: [ONCA ""Waste of Space"" competition](http://onca.org.uk/waste-of-space/). The performance evening will be on Saturday the 8th of February at the ONCA gallery. This would be an excellent chance to showcase your writing and dabble in the eco-creative!

I'd like to imagine that on par with the clubs image and dealings - they tend to be more ""take the higher ground"" and ""we'll do it the slow but right way"" with their transfers too. 


Especially with BR's influence who is so in this mindset that he's risking his reputation on building a ""future winning liverpool team"" rather than a marquee hotfix quick return. He's instilling a philosophy on and off the pitch with a very long term goal. He's thinking seasons ahead in most decisions and building a long term solution with a big youth focus rather than trying to rely on ""quick fixes"". He's taking a steady but powerful uphill walk to the top.


So, when it comes to transfers I think one of the reasons we might potentially keep getting sniped is because BR and the club are taking a more ""traditional and respectful"" approach to the players. Where other clubs might be taking a more ""competitive and cut-throat"" approach. I imagine LFC walking in to the meeting room, being completely honest with the players and not promising them full 1st team slots or over exaggerated wages and other incentive. I think they're being truthful and respectful and saying it how it is and hoping to appeal to the footballers sense of morality.


So basically, I think they look for something even more in targets. Imagine some unknown overnight wonder boy who's sitting in front 5 PL managers all arguing with each-other and throwing money at him making unrealistic promises etc. Meanwhile liverpool slip an envelope with the proposal towards him and sit back. I can see the downsides to this, where one in so many footballers will get caught up in the moment and sign the highest wages or the club will sell to the highest bidder. But some clubs and some footballers will appreciate liverpools culture - and they may not always deal with them - but when they do, they create real relationships with the club built on mutual respect of honesty and professionalism - meanwhile the players that do chose us over other teams are the type of moral mature players that will stay and make a difference for seasons to come.

I'm a 28 year-old graduate from one of Canada's top universities, the University of Victoria, with a 2:1 average. I recieved a Bachelor of Arts degree in Dec 2013 with a major in English and a minor in Professional Communications. I have also recieved an Associates Degree in Creative Writing from Camosun College. 

As for experience, I was a volunteer editor for Camosun College's creative writing journal Beside the Point for four of the five years it was running. I took part in regular brainstorming meetings, marketing, and editing and helped with the book layout. 
I have also done some basic web design for an entrepreneur in Victoria using Adobe software, such as inDesign and Photoshop, as well as Wordpress.
Lastly, I have worked in hospitality at cafes, hotels, and a museum for nearly ten years and ran a small business at a convention for four years. The last was incredibly exhausting with strict deadlines, but highly rewarding and lucrative.

I just moved to London from Canada a little over a week ago for equal-part adventure and employement and I'm loving the people and the culture! I'm a very friendly, energetic woman who loves keeping busy, learning new things, and being challenged. I also make fantastic coffee!

If you'd like to have a look at my CV or have any questions, please email me at: dy.cope@gmail.com

They also refer to Damien Comolli, who studied a lot of Beane's ideologies. Comolli was the Director of Football at Tottenham from 2005 to 2008 (i think?) and brought in a lot of great players for us (Bale/Modric/Berbatov) as well as terrible players for us (Hutton, Taarabt, Bentley).

I think that some of that ideology, especially regarding the idea that EVERY PLAYER HAS HIS PRICE. I think we've seen this winter transfer window how much he values these players; specifically Holtby at rumours of £9-10 mil and Capoue at £15-17 mil. 

Which makes sense because Holtby is probably 2nd option at any midfield position (second to Paulinho as B2B, second to Eriksen as a CAM). The only place he would be first choice is as a ball winning midfielder higher up the pitch, which we don't seem to want as we tend to allow them to attack and counter. Levy values his services as a bench option at around £9-10 mil, and that seems fair.

It also makes sense for Capoue as a backup to Sandro (and some argue Bentaleb) as well as 4th/5th choice CB. Levy values him at £15-17 mil, which is also probably fair considering he is our 2nd most experienced DM.

All in all though, it seems DL does get good money for the players we sell (come on almost £130 mil for two players from RM is pretty good) and even for bench options he tends to get good money from them. Which is probably why we always here other teams saying ""yeah xyz player at Tottenham is good but the price is too high""...",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,Thoughts on Daniel Levy and how he sells...,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1w1eo1/thoughts_on_daniel_levy_and_how_he_sells/

People point to the fact that in ""The Impossible Astronaut,"" the 11th seems to be glowing and about to regenerate (him actually being the Teselecta aside), as well as in ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" when he gives a bit of his regeneration energy to save River, as establishing the Doctor's ability to regenerate further. The inconsistency of these scenes becomes hard to rectify with the new canon that was established in both ""The Day of the Doctor"" and ""The Time of the Doctor.""

Here is where I think we can square everything away: simply redefine regeneration energy as a constant, biological byproduct of Time Lord physiology. In other words it's always with them, and only expresses itself when a Time Lord needs to revitalize himself, and is more chaotically expressed when a Time Lord doesn't have the ability to maintain complete control over it; i.e. when they die and regenerate completely. The longer a Time Lord lives and the more times a Time Lord regenerates, the more energy it uses and the less it has for the next go-around. By redefining this definition, we can not only account for why the 11th no longer has enough energy for a new regeneration at the end of his life, but we can also account for how the Doctor can stay relatively youthful after having lived for centuries in almost all of his forms, and yet he can still maintain the ability to age; it just takes a lot longer because of his biology.

What works with this point of view is that it is actually backed up some by canon. Both Romana and River Song express the ability to control their forms when regenerating, and the new Doctor even uses a face he's seen previously in Pompeii (not to mention the Curator stating that he revisits previous faces later in life while sporting the visage of the 4th Doctor). In ""Rise of the Cybermen,"" the 10th doctor gives up some of his regeneration energy into revitalizing the TARDIS, and is actually quoted as saying he is giving up some years of his life in doing so. In ""Journey's End,"" he uses his energy to heal himself and then siphons off the rest of his chaotic energy into his cut-off hand. The 11th Doctor is probably the best offender of willing use of regeneration energy, using his to heal River Song's hand in ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" and telling the Cyber Controller he can regenerate at will during ""Nightmare in Silver."" And finally, both the 10th and 11th Doctors right before they regenerate are healed of battle wounds and old age and returned to their former, unhurt or aged selves for a period of time before they regenerate. While they don't exhibit control over these particular instances, nevertheless it sets a precedent of regeneration energy's ability to heal, which Time Lords have been said to be able to control in canon, when River Song says she will age backwards to freak people out in ""Let's Kill Hitler.""

Not sure if this works out completely, but I think it's one way we can think about the information we've been given and move past the nitpicking into a new Doctor.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Regeneration energy: Inconsistent?

Cost was £35 for the team.

The objective is - you're locked in a room and have one hour to escape.  Finding where the place was proved to be a bit of a nightmare for our Value Cabs taxi driver,  but we got there in the end - and he was good craic, so I didn't mind paying the extra £1.80 while he drove around in circles.  Finally arrived at the venue (after hassling several mechanics on the way) and was greeted by the guy who designed the room.  Pleasant chap, told us the rules and we entered.

If you're bored, want to try something different - have a go at this.  We had absolutely brilliant craic.  I can't give too much away about the actual game itself, because any spoilers would probably ruin it for you... but worth every penny.

Apparently, if your team manages to escape the room in less than an hour, the guy will give you your money back... our team didn't make it out within the hour, but the challenge in itself felt like money well spent.  It really makes you ""think outside the box"".

It was something a bit different - and I kinda like the idea that Belfast has something like this.  Would recommend to anyone with a spare hour.

To reproduce:

1. Login.  
2. Let your session time out. (10 minutes after your last action, open a new tab and go about your business). A dialogue box is displayed: ""Because we haven't seen you in the last 10 minutes, for your security we have logged you out of your internet banking session."" Do not click anything.
3. Refresh the page. You have not been logged out and your online banking remains fully accessible. This can be repeated to hold a session open indefinitely.

I have tried this twice now and it has worked both times on different pages within online banking.

In the interest of responsible disclosure, I believe the possibility of using this in an attack is minute and that the benefits of making people aware of this far outweighs those of keeping it closed. Lloyds have no e-mail or phone number for inquiries of this type, either, as well as no disclosure/vuln policy.

tl;dr? Log out of your bank account immediately after you are done. 

Further looking around it seems the latest Chrome and IE11 do not seem to be vulnerable. I'm speculating they're using some JS to log the user out that Firefox doesn't like.

Lloyds have responded to me saying they're looking into it.

Of course we will bring Lukaku back from Everton but more than likely I see him coming off the bench in games. He should however start is FA Cup games and Capital One games and some EPL games but most of the time next season he should be coming off the bench to grow more into the player Chelsea need and the player he can come out to be.

I still say Diego Costa (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBvHgA0oiw) would be a great signing for us and he will work great with the likes of Hazard, Oscar, Willian, and Shurrle.

Lukaku (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h3c8c7NNV0) is a great prospect and a future talent more than the one he is now but next season I still say he is still too young to lead a Chelsea team.

This is just my opinion like I said and Lukaku might not be thrilled coming to be in the bench but in all reality asking a 20 year old to lead a Chelsea team to win us the EPL, CL, FA Cup...etc it's something Lukaku has not experienced. Will he be a future talented star and will score 20+ goals a season in the EPL? Yes, without a doubt but I don't see that happening next season.

What do you guys think? Would you start him next season? Or would you want Chelsea to get a covenant striker?

Mata plays best in the role that Rooney is currently fulfilling. Why else would they go for a player like Mata, instead of finding a centre midfielder, a left back or a centre defender? A lot of the United supporters I know in real life have shared a similar sentiment. There are other positions that are in much more dire need of being filled, yet they splash a club record fee on an attacking midfielder?

The fact that Chelsea were willing to sell Mata to Manchester United tells me that something else is going on behind the scenes. United might not be willing to let Rooney go in January, but it wouldn't surprise me to find out that the two clubs have reached a ""gentleman's agreement"" on Rooney's future, seeing as his contract will be down to its last year this summer. Basically, I feel as if this transfer was a goodwill gesture. It surprised the shit out of everyone, including Wenger, so I find it doubtful that Mourinho decided to let Mata go to United ""out of the goodness of his own heart.""

So I figured I'd break down the numbers to see what the probability of the team breaking the single season record. First thing I wanted to do was break the data down to make scoring a goal count as a success and not scoring a goal count as a failure. This is an independent model and is analogous to having a situation where you roll a die and a success is rolling a six and a failure is rolling any other number. Therefore, I had to break the games down into discrete intervals since City often scores more than 1 goal per game. I decided to break the games into 30 3 minute intervals, because I felt that 90 1 minute intervals were not representative of runs of play. Therefore over the first 22 games of the season City scored 63 goals, and, using this as the expected value for those 22 games, City has a 9.55% chance of scoring a goal during each 3 minute interval. Using the way I had broken down the data set I was able to make a binomial model which is written as 

f(x,n,p)= (n! * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x))/(x! * (n-x)!) 

where x=successes n=intervals p=probability of success. 

So, City beats the single season goal scoring record if they score 41 or more goals (x&gt;=41) over the next 16 games (n=16 * 30), with an independent chance of success each 3 minute interval (9.55%). So the probability of that happening is equal to sum of each probability f(x&gt;=41, 16 * 30, 0.0955). Using a stats program called ""r"" I can have my computer do that operation using the command ""1-pbinom(40, 16 * 30, 0.0955)"" which means ""the probability of not scoring less than 40 goals over the last 16 games."" This yielded the result of City having a **79.378%** chance of beating Chelsea's current record of 103 goals in a season by 1 or more goals.

Mata´s gone red

but shall remain a blue.



To Stamford Bridge he came and 

helped us reach our aim.



With his special finess

his first season became a success.



Scoring in his first game

the boy from spain gained lots of fame.



With his awarness and creativity 

he certainly enhanced our productivity.



*The reason is because we won two major titles and

*Mata won his first player of the season.



Not only could he assist.

After a while he got bored and scored.



Comming from Spain he never seemed to complain.



We knew he didn´t have much of a choice.

It was either play for Moyes or being the fifth wheel 

in a Rolls Royce.



It´s a pity that 

he has left the big city.

To the place where one

won last year´s match.

With tears we must see him leave. 

All we can do now is be thankful for

what we managed to achieve.



We hope to see him continue to perform.

Like he did in last year´s Chelsea uniform.



United will get a hell of a player.

But if they want to win against Chelsea

they will have to come up with a hell of a prayer!

So I've been trying to teach myself CSS, and I decided to see if I could get a subreddit to look as close to the official www.mcfc.co.uk website as possible.  I gave it a go and /r/testsubject1b is the result.  I think it's a reasonable facsimilie.

I wanted to offer it up to the community as an option for the look of /r/MCFC.  It's obviously quite a change.  The current style of the subreddit is bright and playful, and this proposed change is fairly dark and serious, but also pretty professional-looking in my opinion.    So what do you think?

Don't worry about anyone's feelings, the current subreddit style has been pieced together by various mods since it was created, and the proposed new style isn't really my design per-se - it's an attempt to copy a pre-existing design (plus I've already implemented something similar on /r/NYCFC, so I'm golden).

One day I found my sister watching an episode, I had nothing else better to do so I figured why not. I got super hooked and couldn't stop watching. Within 2 months I had watched the entirety of the 2005 series episodes. When I first brought up the fact with my friends that I had started watching it, I thought they wouldn't really care. We are all good friends and I just mentioned it in common conversation. They all immediately mocked me, nothing too much, just a little joking, then it went away. Just yesterday, out of the blue, my friend randomly said 'I would argue that Doctor Who fans are worse than My Little Pony fans."" We were all taken aback by this. At first we all argued with him, but after a while it seemed to be me arguing with all of them. It came to the point where they were being straight up immature. ""hur hur hur look at me, I fly around in a big blue box I'm so cool."" At that point I promptly hung up the skype call and haven't spoken to them since. I would really like to resolve this as they are really the only friends I have. What do I do?

Side Note: If they had ever actually tried the show and then came to the conclusion that they didn't like it, I would totally accept it. But the thing is, none of them have ever even seen it. They just hate it for some reason. I think it may partly be that they have committed so much to hating it, they are afraid they might like it if they gave it a chance.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,Someone I considered a close friend is now greatly mocking me for adoring this show.

Evidentially I live close to Disneyland and decided to get an annual pass because well why not? I went with some friends and we were having good times when I noticed the same 11th portrait in Paradise Pier at Disney's California Adventure. Me and a fellow Whovian friend of mine were astonished by the portraits when the artist decided to approach us about it. Her name is Crystal Webb and she creates portraits for people at the Disneyland Resort. Along with being a fantastic artist, she is also a huge whovian who creates great pieces of art that she sells and auctions off. She is very nice and kind and I had the pleasure of meeting her and I believe she deserves recognition for her art. Don't be shy and feel free to stop by and say hi to her if you see her during your visit to Disneyland as she welcomes conversation with fellow whovians :) Oh also sorry for the blurry pictures and/or low quality, my phone is not the greatest &gt;.&lt;

* Nasri's Injured so it's out of Lopes/Milner/Navas

* Richards is back

* Does Rodwell start?

* Does Jovetic Start?

I would like to see:

Dzeko

Lopes Jovetic Milner

Fernandino(45') Garcia

Kolarov Demichelis Lescott Richards

Pantilimon

* Navas swapped for Milner so Navas is fresh for the spurs clash, let Lopes start again- he needs all the time he can get! great young talent

* Demichelis on for Nastasic, because i would like Nastasic to be reinstated into our Premier League XI ASAP and against spurs

* Dzeko is on awesome form and negredos injured, Its also important that Jovetic gets 90' under his belt, plus Aguero needs a rest to be fresh for spurs

* Its also a good game to ease Richards back into the team from injury

* Ferna getting subbed for Jack Rodwell at 45' mins (only because im just not sold on a Rodwell-Garcia partnership yet)

I know how people like to see Luiz (for whatever reason) as our next captain, but I honestly think that he currently lacks the discipline to fill that role.

The articles in question were based on a report done by UWE professors who were presumably horrified by its misrepresentation. And what's more, the first and incorrect article was prominently placed in the paper yet the retraction was just a few paragraphs and buried somewhere inside.


I ask you, how can a paper get something so wrong? Was it incompetence or deliberate? Y'know what, it's almost like the publishers have an agenda! They want the paper to appeal to the Daily Mail motoring brigade who regard any restrictions on their right to drive their poxy cars as fast as they like, wherever and whenever they like as a massive infringement of their liberty. So misquoting a report from a reputable source might serve the paper's commercial interests. The small-minded-middle-England mob see the headline, 75% to Ignore 20mph ban, and they buy the paper. Sales go up, profit goes up, ignorance soars, and no-one reads the correction and apology.

Earlier in the week they started a competition: send in pictures of the prettiest street in Bristol and they even got that wrong. They published the article online with a picture of Redland Park and labeled it Redland Road! Comments from readers put them right. The article seems to have gone now.


And last year they covered the announcement that 20mph limits were to be spread across Bristol with the news that BCC were going to spend something like £25m on it when in actual fact it was something like £2m!

He reminded me somewhat of Zola, and just like the great man, he too was loved not only by the Chelsea crowd but also by away fans, no mean feat in today’s match day climate. Indeed, he could walk into any team in the Premier League but sadly not into the one that really mattered.

He was certainly different to today’s modern footballer – educated, cultured and swerving tattoos and controversy and the bright lights of London, saving them for visits to art galleries, museums and places of historic interest and bringing in his friends from Spain to explore these places with him.

He didn’t forget his roots either, buying shares in his old club Oviedo when they were running into financial problems – true to the mark of the man.

He has a unique record too and that is scoring on his debuts in the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup and the World Club Championships-a truly great accomplishment.

I had the pleasure of meeting Juan on several occasions and he was always ready and willing to sign autographs and was particularly brilliant with kids who idolised him – he is such a superb role model.

His wizardry on the ball was second to none and his record of assists beats many hands down.

In his first season he helped Chelsea win the FA Cup and his contribution to our Champions League season was legendary, after telling Drogba we still have time to equalise and delivering a perfect corner to him to do just that in the last minutes of normal time in Munich.

After Robbie’s dismissal when heads were down once more, he single handedly dragged us through the season and got us to the Europa League final and indeed once again delivered the corner which decided the game and made history again for the club.

With the announcement of the appointment of Jose Mourinho at the start of the season it was rumoured that Mata ‘wasn’t his sort of player’ and although he started at Everton and indeed made chances which others hashed, he didn’t feature again until, ironically, Norwich away where he played a part in our 3 1 win. He assisted JT’s goal at Tottenham away and then helped in our 4 3 win at Sunderland but wasn’t even in the squad for the league cup game match which we lost up there and I knew then that the writing was on the wall.

It’s a great shame that a coach with Mourinho’s abilities couldnt find a place in his team for Mata’s talents but with the defensive format he adopts, Mata was better off leaving-both for the sake of his football career and for him personally. Nevertheless, throughout the whole episode, he has acted with total professionalism.

Let it be said that the last time I felt so upset about a player leaving was when, ironically, Zola left us at the end of the season. However, they were totally different situations.

I wish the two time Chelsea Player of the Year all the very best for the future. Thanks Juan for all the entertainment you provided and for being part of the Chelsea history and for making it all possible. Its been an utter, utter pleasure to be associated with you.

As things turned out, I just continued using my personal bank account, out of habit. I called to cancel after a bit, to avoid any charges, but was told I had a year or so free banking left, so I kept it just in case... with about £3 in it.

Shortly after this I got a full time job as an employee, and informed HMRC, etc. that I ceased operating as a sole trader. I also moved to another address.

Fast forward to today, when I found the old chequebook for the account in my documents. 

I'm not sure what to do about it. The account doesn't appear on my credit record and they haven't been in touch (they had called me on the phone a few times in the past).  I haven't changed my number.

As the ""business"" no longer exists, should I just forget about it again? Should I get in touch? Would they have closed the account, or is there a chance they'll send me crazy bills for unpaid account charges if I ever show them I am still contactable?

**UPDATE:** I bit the bullet and gave them a call. They told me they put an inactive flag on the account because of an undelivered letter returned to them (before the 18 months free banking expired).

I have been living an a property for just over a year. Since living here the boiler has not functioned properly, last winter it would not work at all, the landlord got it fixed by a company. The engineer said that the timer was broken, so disconnected it. But the boiler then would only work periodically. The engineer came out again 3 months later. Had a look at it and said the diaphragm/float (or something similar) was not getting enough pressure. He said the only option is a new boiler. The landlord was told. Then last month the engineer came out again as it was playing up again, no pilot light, (pay by bill, so no chance of cutoff). I have emailed him twice last week with my four week notice, he claims not too of received it. Then the landlord asked if I would pay a contribution to the boiler repair!!!
