true,[deleted],null,null,"PSG had a reputation for having roudy fans. Added to that their 2 main stands had ultra groups who did not like each other. To simplify things, Boulogne was white nationalist, while Auteuil was multi cultural and apolitical, but more leaning on left wing.

In the year 2000's things started getting worse as the results of the team worsened. 3 big events brought the ultras in trouble. I cant remember the order but they included

1) PSG lose at home to an Israeli club in Europa league. Boulogne boys chase Jewish fans. An off duty policeman tries to protect the a Jewish fan and shoots and kills a Boulogne fan

2) Marseille beat PSG 3-0 in Paris. Marseille fans are not allowed to travel to Paris for the game. So pissed off Paris fans attack each other. Autueil fans beat up and kill a Boulogne leader

3.) French cup final Lens-PSG at the Stade de France. French cup final is on national tv and is attended by President and many kids. Normally its more family orientated. PSG fans unhurl a huge banner calling people from the North region where Lens is from as Pedophiles, Insestuals, and alcoholics


This big events are added to alot of troubles PSG fans had been doing. So the PSG direction along with the French government take the drastic step of banning ALL ultra groups. There are 13,000 in these groups, however only a few minority of maybe 300 causeproblems, yet everyone is punished equally. And ever since this has been the case at home games. PSG stadium which used to have one of the best athmospheres in France is very quiet now and boring. Added to that, the direction pass alot of restrictive moves to kill even more the athmosphere

No banners allowed

The art and graffiti ultra groups used to decorate their sections in the stadiums are erased

People are assigned random seating. This is the only club in the world to my knowledge that does this. This means that when you buy a ticket, you are assigned a random area in the stadium and you cannot come in groups larger than 8. They did this to make it impossible for fans to gather together.

Apart from a small section of hardcore fans, everyone agreed there was a problem with PSG fans. People were willing to try and find solutions but instead the direction has had a total ban without any negotiation. They are trying to change the PSG crowd by having more young people, higher class people, basically people who watch the games sitting down and you clap whenever there is a goal. When you watched PSG games in the early 2000s, seeing the athmosphere today is really sad and its annoying that the direction is not trying to do anything to accomodate historic fans",0,1342899438,null,0,false,0,c5hciwn,t3_wrbbl,t1_c5hciwn,t1_c5hc2kf,null,1429434081,1,false,Ligue1,t5_2sc3j,1

The situation now sounds similar to that of Northern Ireland where, although there was significant support for a united Ireland during the Troubles, the support has dwindled since then and the majority of Nationalists are content with the current situation. 

But there are other factors at play there such as the ability of the Republic to afford unification right now, the hugely improved rights for Catholics, something that can now actually be called democracy in place and an understanding that it will have to go to a vote and the unionist population is still bigger.

But it is still at the back of people's minds. Many are happy with the status quo for now but if the opportunity presents itself in the future opinions may change again. Particularly with the continuing demographic trends favouring the Catholic/Nationalist community.

Because of that I think there still may be larger support in Basque that isn't showing up in polls but is at the back of peoples' minds, dormant. It's difficult to tell though and I don't know the Basque situation quite as well to be sure.

There are probably decent resources comparing the delays and processes throughout Europe. If you can't find any, why don't you ask your professors in Warsaw if you could write a thesis on this matter, comparing the legal frameworks with the associated economical benefits or handicaps.

What I know about the French process is that it can be considerably simplified and somewhat accelerated for highly qualified immigrants by the quality and importance of people who will agree to write to the administration recommending that you should be granted residency or citizenship as soon as possible.

As this will probably be something shared by the relevant processes of whatever state you eventually choose, I suggest that you network as much as possible throughout your education, in order to be able to ask many people of power and importance to intercede on your behalf.

Start with your professors and the high-level administrative staff at every business school you set foot on.

Continue with every business leader and executive you get in contact with. Once you have met them, find excuses to meet them again, especially if you can find a way to be of use to them.

Involve yourself in politics and law. Go interview people for the school newspaper, etc.

I spent last year in Nice, but never once made it to Cap Ferrat, so I couldn't say too much about it!

Monaco is just down the road(half hour train ride, about 4 euro) and has just as much, or more to see!
In reference to the Carte 12-25 discount card, I'm fairly certain it only comes as an annual thing, and as such costs upward of 70 Euro, clearly not worth it in the savings you'de make in a 2-3 week trip.  
Trains are cheaper than flying, rideshares are cheaper than trains, and hitch hiking is cheaper than rideshares. It all just depends on your taste for adventure!

Besides the political mood in spain right now is to decrese the autonomy of the regions instead of increasing it, so I don't think the central goverment will cede even an inch more autonomiy to catalonia. Also every time a region gets more autonomy the rest demand it to, not to be less, and generalizing the basque fiscal system would mean the end of the spanish state as such.

As far as violence go its quite unlikely catalans resort to that, because they would lose every time (spain has an army, catalonia does not). Also any kind of violence would seve as an excuse to stop the independece movement. Only if the proces is perfectly democratic would catalonia have a chance to get the international support it needs.

In summary, I think that in the next year the chances of independence will reach is maximum, because the catalan parties are backed into a corner, after next year they will probably lose credibility to lead such a complicated process. Ofc this doesn't not mean it will happen. Another important factor that goe against indepence is the finacial crisis, if catalonia would declare independence all of a sudden, is very likely that both spain and cataloina would go imediatly to bankrupcy because both would probably be shot out of the international financial markets, and obiously germany and co. would try to stop an even leading to that.",0,1342918846,null,0,false,0,c5hgkdo,t3_wx6kw,t1_c5hgkdo,t1_c5hg618,null,1429436061,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I would also recommend Eze village, Cap d'ail and Villefranche Sur Mer (especially Villfranche). The only travel recommendation that I have is that you should use Nice as your base and that way you can buy a weekly bus ticket and get buses from the city centre. Can't remember how much it is but it was fairly cheap.

The best way to get from Paris to Nice is by train. There is a website (I can't remember the name!) for splitting the cost of a car journey. It will probably save a little money but it would take a full on day of driving or two days if that's too much. So in the long run a train is the best bet. You might also want to check low cost internal flights, but I don't know the prices.

The best business environment is certainly not one where things happen as you portrait. Government policies will not become better if you just allow companies to do as they please (which is pretty much the 'best business environment'), it will become worse. So will any efficiency and public service.

The alternative is that companies and richer individuals will not get away with paying 0.002% taxes, where I pay 50%, anymore.

If all jobs for 'normal' people disappear because the real work is being done by machines and robots, and computers and networks. If these are all made to optimalize profits for the happy few, and keep the rest begging for a low-wage part-time job, then where would there be any incentive for the 'system' to become better? The rich and the companies will just arm themselves (even more then now, and even in western countries) and the poor will simply die or become gettho-ized.

Later researchers then said there was no evidence for any of the numbers and even evidence for a famine was hard to come by. There's almost no qualitative evidence of the famine, interviews with peasants even tend to indicate the opposite. Farmers loved Mao. So they concluded a minor famine leading to a drop in fertility, but no excessive deaths. 

What we do know is that life expectancy rose each year (from 35 to 65 under Mao's reign), food production rose with 169%, population grew with 77%, per capita food with about 80% and most strikingly, value of industry in the GDP went from 36% to 72%. So, whatever the casualties of the famine (or genocide if you believe it was deliberate), China under Mao did not suffer from it. And many lives were saved thanks to the agricultural reforms, to the point they even had to forbid people from breeding.

The anti-nuclear position has a long history in Germany and is rooted in the peace movement and environment movement. In the 70s only the fringe of the left distrusted nuclear power technology and the big evil centralized industry necessary for it. Then 1986 the Chernobyl disaster happened. This changed all. The radioactive fallout cloud covered large parts of the country. Crops were distroyed. I remember as a child I wasn't allowed by my parents to drink milk anymore. Even in 2012 one shouldn't eat the meat of wild pigs or mushrooms from the forest, because it is contaminated by radioactivity! 

http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/a-quarter-century-after-chernobyl-radioactive-boar-on-the-rise-in-germany-a-709345.html

France was largely spared from the fallout. Perhaps that made all the difference. 

After that traumatic event opposition of nuclear energy was the purpose and ambition of the green party and gradually became the mainstream position. Germany also has no ""final storage"" (Endlager) for nuclear waste, which provides constant political strife: What geological formations would be adequate for storage in all eternity and of course no city wants the storage in their backyard.

Nuclear power was planned to be fazed out already, but when Fukushima happened it was like switching a button. The technology was just dead. Even the conservative parties or the industry couldn't advocate it anymore, there is no support in the media whatsoever, you find no popular scientist who will argue for it.

Theoretically, (*handled in a sensible way, safeguarded by harsh laws and continuously and thoroughly checked upon by powerful authorities*) nuclear energy is safe. Some research is still necessary to get a handle on the waste issue etc, and much more money is needed to shred the old antiques we have running right now and build new ones, but that's peanuts in comparison to the real issue. 

The issue being: That's the theory. In reality we have paper tiger authorities, politicians pandering to public opinion, corruption and lobbyists out the wazoo. Corners are cut, shortcuts taken, shit happens. Sad thing is, this time the shit that happens is highly toxic, odor- and tasteless, invisible, of varying toxicity, and basically indestructible.

- a loud bell
- at least two independent brakes (a back pedal brake may be one of them)
- a bright light at the front and a red one at the back, powered either by a dynamo or batteries.

Police can and will check whether your bike is safe. The tires should have some profile left and enough air in it (you can use air compressors intended for cars at gas stations - it's easier than doing it by hand), each brake has to be able to stop the bike from the speeds it can reach downhill. I've experienced brake failure and was glad my other brake was able to stop the bike in time. Your used bike will most likely have worn down brake pads, so better change them.

The frame should be without rust or cracks and not bend or vibrate when driving over potholes. Do, if possible, a test run around the block before buying.

If you want to increase your visibility (aka your chance of survival), consider wearing a reflective vest and a helmet. Neither are mandatory, but I can't recommend them enough. I wouldn't be writing this text if a helmet hadn't protected my head a few years ago. I've also seen bikers attaching little blinking lights to their helmet, bike and body, which are available at every bike store (*Fahrradhändler*).

Don't ride the bike if you are drunk or high, this will result in the same kind of fines and ""interesting"" experiences with the German police and legal system as if you were driving a car or motorbike under the same conditions.

You should have at least a rough knowledge of the *Straßenverkehrsordnung* (a collection of laws concerning road and street usage). The aforementioned rules regarding the equipment of the bike and intoxication are among those laws. Here's a [basic introduction](http://www.gettingaroundgermany.info/regeln.shtml). Most of this is focused on cars, but the basic rules are the same for bikes. Know the most important [traffic signs](http://www.gettingaroundgermany.info/zeichen.shtml).

So much for gun loving, gun toting Americans.

As for the ""other half"" of the Americans that are against gun restrictions, please consider that American culture and ideology puts a lot of emphasis on self reliance and personal responsibility. A gun is a huge responsibility and very dangerous. Actually most dangerous to yourself (you are much more likely to get seriously injured or killed if you carry a gun). Americans even accept that. They just consider that people should be responsible and take on the responsibility, if they carry a gun.

true,BusHeckler,EURO,European Union,"If you cut too hard and fast you're going to cripple the social help that the states provide Eurocitizens - scaling back is necessary in an efficiency sense but I argue that the states should attempt to keep as many people in employment as possible. In this way a certain amount of nationalisation and therefore increased expenditure must be accepted.

The logic is simple - the more money people have in their pockets, the more they will spend, or save. If they're spending, YAY more money in companies' bank accounts so fewer companies going bankrupt and so fewer jobs being lost. If they're saving, YAY more REAL money the banks can lend out to needy businesses trying to get short term credit to fulfil orders and keep people employed.

The way to pay for the state expenditure should be through high income taxes for those already in higher brackets of tax and a reeling in of banking (some sort of banking sector special taxes) and 'off-shore' tax avoidance. This should be relatively easy in Europe as most of the off-shore banking happens IN the EU in places like the UK Channel Islands and our friends Luxembourg and Liechtenstein. Not a repatriation of these funds, but allowing of other EU states to claim their taxes on funds in fellow EU states' banking companies.

High income rates can be softened so as not to punish industries that can easily fly the EU, or that don't deserve it. Manufacturing and service industries don't really deserve their high earners being fucked over, but banking and financial industries certainly do. As for those that can leave easily, manufacturing is an obvious one where we already struggle to compete with the East - wouldn't want to pile on any more pressure there.

As a final clause, simply opening up banking sectors in all countries to make small banks - and keeping multiple bank accounts per person - the norm. A few hundred £s/Euros in one bank, a few hundred in another, a pension with one, a savings account with another. If one fails, np, we cool.

It would have a huge proportion of it's population incarcerated for trivial charges! The media would start lying to them! Their government would descend into two parties squabbling over who gets to live in a big white house!

They would break up peaceful assemblies! Their government would start scaremongering and use fear as an excuse for controlling the movement of their population all overseen by scary, faceless agencies with aggressive three letter acronyms! Thank God for that man sitting in his room surrounded by rifles arguing on the internet!

The reason the Eurozone mess has dragged on for so long is all about politicians appealing to their electorate. Hell you could argue that the economic crisis of the last few years is due to politicians making decisions to win votes rather than in the best interest of their countries.

Merkel is holding it up as she knows she will be out of a job when the necessary changed are made.

But Joyce Lee Malcolm points out some of the pitfalls in that approach. For example, the murder rate in New York City has been more than five times that of London for two centuries -- and during most of that time neither city had any gun control laws.

&gt; In England as in America, sensational gun crimes have been seized upon and used politically to promote crackdowns on gun ownership by law-abiding citizens, while doing nothing about criminals. American zealots for the Brady bill say nothing about the fact that the man who shot James Brady and tried to assassinate President Reagan has been out walking the streets on furlough.

Thomas Sowell, [Gun Control Myths](http://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2002/11/26/gun_control_myths/page/full/), check also [part II](http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell112702.asp):

&gt; The grand dogma of the gun controllers is that places with severe restrictions on the ownership of firearms have lower rates of murder and other gun crimes. How do they prove this? Simple. They make comparisons of places where this is true and ignore all comparisons of places where the opposite is true.

&gt; Most people who are in favor of gun control laws support such laws because they believe that these laws will reduce the number of firearms deaths. Such people are not the problem.

&gt; The problem is with very different kinds of people, often in leadership positions, whose support for gun control laws is strong enough to override any facts.

If you are willing to kill someone using a gun is sort of effortless and can be done from a distance, while using a knife is a physical act, where you have to get close and in contact with your victim. 

Maybe not in this case but in a lot of cases I think people would think twice before they stab someone because I think the idea of a blade cutting flesh, is something everyone can imagine and is affraid of, while a gunshot is something abstract, I have nothing to compare it to and therefore the whole process of shooting someone is a sort of sureal scenario.

I also assume that it's also quite exhausting to kill people with a knife, so I would expect that killing sprees like the one Aurora would have drastically less victims.

true,dumnezero,ROMA,Romania,"&gt;Because the right to bear arms is what differentiates a free person from a slave

Close... but no; free persons are different thanks to a form of property rights. Slavery is pretty old, older than guns and you can read about it in history books. Weapons don't guarantee freedom. In the history of slavery, you'll find plenty of cases of soldiers and warriors being slaves to an army.

&gt; Also guns can prevent crimes (imagine if one person on Utoya had a gun except for Breivik).

You're thinking that someone would use it...  you think it's so easy to shoot someone...

Rather than prevent crime, weapons are just great stuff to steal and sell. The more people keep guns, to more guns that are ""lost"" and washed up in the underground of society.

&gt;The criminals will get their weapons anyway.

Which criminals? You seem to think all criminals are willing to risk the consequences of homicide. 

And no, they won't get it anyway. The less guns there are floating around, the harder it is to get one; it's just like any other commodity. It would raise their price, though (which has good and bad consequences).

&gt;Also, if guns are banned, should we ban knives and other pointy things as well? Or are these reasonable threats?

No, but we should keep an eye out for knife-throwing courses. If you really can't tell the difference between a gun and a knife, well, Google it.  I do want to point out that guns are basically really good at offering the ability to kill someone with the ~~push of a button~~ squeezing of a trigger and good just at that (well, maybe paper weights, but who uses those anymore?). A knife has many uses.

I'm for the strict gun-control laws and I still consider myself a free man. You do not need to point a gun against your bosses head in order to be free, you can instead resign any time you wish. There's absolutely no need for guns in modern world (read: the West) if protection (e.g. police) is usually just one phone call away.

&gt;Also guns can prevent crimes (imagine if one person on Utoya had a gun except for Breivik).

The Utøya massacre was not first incident in which police didn't respond in time, neither will it be the last.

It's not because of ethnicity, it's because of large amounts of poverty in large cities, and poor people are primarily minorities:

&gt; During 1999--2002, among persons aged 10--19 years, the homicide rate for blacks was estimated to be 17.8 per 100,000 population, a rate 10 times that of whites (1.8 per 100,000)

[Source](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6001a14.htm)

The per captia homicide rate of white people, who do not make up the vast majority of those living in poverty, is similar to that of Europe, which has a homicide rate of 5.4 per 100,000. The vast majority of homicides in America happen in poor inner-city neighborhoods and are gang related.

&gt; homicide and violent crime is greatest in urban areas of the United States. In metropolitan areas, the homicide rate in 2005 was 6.1 per 100,000 compared with 3.5 in non-metropolitan counties.

1. Tougher gun laws, explicitly, bring back the 1994 ban on Assault Rifles and magazine capacity.
2. Universal health care (Help those that are sick and need mental attention)
3. Stop victimizing killers in the media

I don't really have a good explanation as to why Americans/redditors fetishise guns as much as they do, but I imagine it has a lot to do with:

1) The frontier - we needed cowboys with guns to conquer it, so guns became integral to American culture, which leads me to...

2) Film/TV - The amount of American-made films and television where the hero's only viable solution is to shoot his enemy is absolutely mind-boggling. I think that really helps develop an extremely absolutist mentality when it comes to violence.

3) Fear - Americans are very scared of home invasions and tend to believe their only defense is having a gun, since tasers, pepper spray, or other non-lethal weapons are apparently not viable options.

4) Demographics - the majority of redditors are white males. The math isn't hard.

true,DisregardMyPants,UNSA,United States,"&gt;But still, the issue here is minimum wage laws. Right now, in Greece, minimum wage is hardly enough for someone to survive, let alone have a family.

But a lower minimum wage would make it so that it would require less money to survive.

If I'm creating FoodProductA, my costs are the cost of production, wages, and then a small percent for profit. If minimum wage goes down, that let's me move the price of the food product down...and if there's a big enough base of people(those making minimum wage) that can't afford the product without me moving the price down, it makes sense to.

&gt;Therefore, according to my original argument, lowering it further is only worthwhile after the cost of living is decreased.

I agree with this, but what I'm saying is that you can't really bring down the cost of living *until* you bring down that minimum wage. That cost decrease is what *allows* for the price decrease.

The businesses can't run at a loss on the off chance minimum wage will lower and make it worthwhile. It can cause some temporary problems while prices catch up, but things really do have to move in the order of wage decrease-&gt;price decrease. And while this seems like it would achieve an identical equilibrium to what existed already, the difference is that *more* people are able to be hired, and therefore *more* can afford the necessities.

Decreased wages where? All I've heard of was public employees wages going down, and that has no impact at all on prices.

Same thing for unemployment - a high unemployment rate technically brings down the per-capita income, but has no impact on prices because the products themselves are no cheaper to produce as a result of unemployment.

Also, are you talking about domestic products or imports?

&gt;just because your false ideal about how markets work predicts that eventually these wages will become livable.

Errr..false ideal? Sorry buddy, but it's easily seen in countries across the world. It's why people in places like India and Vietnam can survive on lower wages than you can in the US or Germany: because the lower wages have led to lower priced products in that country that make it possible.

What I'm discussing isn't some abstract theory. It's reality, easily observable in dozens and dozens of countries.

&gt;Prices adjust according to demand first. 

Yes, and a decrease in demand from prices being too high increases demand for lower priced products. When companies have decreased expenses from the wages, they will enter these cheaper markets so they can gain more revenue from the unoccupied niche.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I currently live in Texas and I have lived here off and on, for a good portion of my life (28 years old). Aside from spending three years overseas while in the US Army, I have lived in the states my entire life. I have, however, traveled quite a bit and I am aware of what else is out there.

I own a few guns.
I enjoy it as a sport.

I have a concealed handgun license. I do not, however, carry a gun with me where ever I go. The two main reasons that I went through the trouble of acquiring a concealed handgun license, was that it facilitates the gun buying process and there are also VERY few occasions when carrying a handgun would be ideal.

I get the whole gun nut stereotype and, YES, they freak me out too. For example, the instructor for the concealed handgun license class that I took, was out of this world. He would go on and on how he has AK-47's in tennis racket cases in each one of his cars trunks. How he and his wife take classes together on how to clear a house, just as a tactical SWAT unit would. He had at least two guns on him at all times... Yada, Yada, Yada... You get the idea.

This is how I see guns... They are a hunk of metal, polymers, and wood. Nothing more.
I see marijuana and most other drugs as the same. A plant. A substance that does nothing to anyone, when sitting on a table.

In the states, we have the Democratic party which is PRO drug decriminalization, and the Republican party which is PRO maintaining gun legalization.

The Democrats state that drugs need to be decriminalized and regulated, because people will use them, obtain them, regardless. But, guns need to be outlawed. No questions asked.

The Republicans state the same thing for guns, and, in turn, they say that drugs are bad and need to stay illegal.

What is all boils down to, in my opinion, is psychology. Reactance is a well studied psychological phenomenon, where simply by making something taboo or illegal, you increase its desirability.

Making guns illegal, will not make them disappear. AK-47's are very easy to manufacture and I could easily see criminal organizations sprouting up to manufacture them, should the DEMAND ever warrant it. I see that as being unlikely though as the supply for them is out of this world. If you make ammunition illegal, however, I could definitely see this happening with ammunition. You would create a black market, just like what happened with booze in the 20's and now with illegal drugs.

You also need to understand that, YES, this is a mental health issue. If someone wants to kill themselves, someone else, or multiple people in a public place, it is going to happen regardless. 

For example, look to the Iraq/Afghanistan conflicts... Policing efforts... Whatever you want to call them. Are the majority of the soldiers killed by gunfire? No, they are killed by Improvised Explosive Devices. Guns are inefficient at creating mass casualties. Banning guns could actually push individuals to more lethal means to carry out whatever it is that they want to do.

Black powder, nitro glyceryn, propane tanks, gasoline, and other explosives/flammable substances, are easy to come by and manufacture at home in a modern society. I can also think of a half dozen poisons that are equally easy to come by.

The bottom line is that if you eliminate guns, PERSON X just reaches two inches to the left, in their quest for finding their tool of destruction.

Yes, we do have a high rate of homicide, compared to the rest of the western world but, IN MY OPINION, it is due to MANY contributing factors. The biggest one, however, would be our lackluster healthcare system. Multiple studies have shown that prisons in the states, are nothing more than the endpoint for individuals with untreated bipolar disorder. When you have individuals like this that aren't properly treated, they end up in the prison system.

Another contributing factor would be, in my opinion, our asinine war on drugs. Just look to our prohibition era, where violent crime soared when we made alcohol illegal. Making drugs illegal, creates nasty environments.

I also try to look at it from a purely business, numbers only perspective. For example, take the attacks on 9/11, where about 3000 individuals died. The USofA then went on an emotionally fueled rampage, where we destroyed two countries, and wasted over 4 trillion dollars.

In my opinion, that 4 trillion would have been better spent by giving every US citizen healthcare because far more lives would have been saved.

Where does this tie into the Colorado incident? Well, something bad happened and it WILL invoke an emotional response. All that I ask is that you act like an adult when putting together a response, instead of acting like an angry, drunk, teenager at a bar, whose mother was just insulted.

You also need to understand that BAD THINGS happen. It is a fact of life. Although you may want something to blame for it, there is nothing that you can do.

Banning guns will not solve the problem because there are too many other means available, to accomplish the same, if not greater goal. Bombs are illegal to sell and purchase in the states but, did that stop Timothy McVeigh from blowing up the Oklahoma City Federal Building?

Drugs and weapons still make their way into supermax prisons. Murders still happen in supermax prisons.

In my opinion, the correct answer is not to create a police state. All the USofA needs to do, is fix its god damn healthcare system. Too many people either need help and do not know it or they know they do but cannot afford it.

This is, however, just my two cents.

But in recent years banks share prices aren't so good, so they can't easily sell more shares for cash. So instead they lower the amount of lending they do which is the last thing you want to force them to do in the current climate...

I would advise you to fully understand my argument before insulting me. Considering you immediately followed this with something you didn't understand about my argument, perhaps you should have held off longer.

&gt;First of all, why would decreasing public sector wages have no impact? 

Because that doesn't decrease the expense of producing the product. The price of the product incorporates the expense of the employees working for the company, not random public employees.

Lower wages for public employees could impact the expense of producing a good if there was an immediate reduction in taxes to match the salary, but Greek businesses didn't pay much tax in the first place *and* there was no immediate drop for those that did because the money is still needed elsewhere.

Especially in Greece's case I can't see how reducing the wages of public workers would have an impact on prices no matter what they did.

&gt;You are arguing against a straw-man here. I concede that lower wages can lead to lower cost of life in general. 

Not a strawman, a misunderstanding at worst.

&gt;First, wages in Greece have already been lowered and prices have not even started catching up yet.

That article doesn't really give enough information to create a diagnosis. It doesn't say whether he's counting the unemployed in the ""wages and salaries have fallen"" number, he doesn't separate out private/public salary reductions(huge in a country with a public workforce the size of Greece's) and most importantly: he doesn't say which income bracket is falling or *when* it's fallen(important in figuring out why prices haven't caught up).

The other end of it is that the slew of bankruptcies for businesses in Greece does leave them with a severe lack of internal competition that can cause serious problems. Greece is - by all accounts - a worse case scenario. Everything has to go right and very little has.

Well there are two extremes: employers will never raise the wages at the lower end and just wait for the state to do it or employers will respond to employees' wage demands as much as they do now and the state can keep the low wage subsidy fixed (at x% of unemployment benefit). I think the reality would lie somewhere in the middle, obviously you could try to make sure somehow that employers don't abuse the system. The state can also increase taxes on these service sector firms if it appears that they are just ""offloading wages"" to the state.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; You make good points, but why don't e.g. farmers respond to #3 and start pushing out more product and slightly undercut the market price? 

You know as well as I that the food market is tightly regulated because of the Common Agricultural Policy. Even so, Greek farmers are notoriously unorganised. Even so, what you have suggested started happening, but on a small scale that makes no real difference in the grand scheme of things.

The rest of your comment seems a bit off-topic. What do any of the things you mention have to do with prices not adjusting to internal devaluation? Anyway, I'll give short answers to all your points:

&gt; The way I've understood this mess is that Greece has less industry than Northern European countries, yet they had almost the same wages + public sector. Pre-euro you could devalue your currency to regain competitiveness, but afterwards it wasn't possible. And then all the overdue reforms to improve productivity and the general health of the public sector.

That's part of it, sure. Actually, the wages and public sector only started rivaling the rich countries after we joined the eurozone. And that only happened because a cheap credit line became available to Greece at the time. That is the crux of the issue, as far as I can tell: Foreign excess capital was invested en masse in Greece. This fueled a bubble; gains in productivity could not catch up to increases in wages. (This is where your point becomes relevant. You could argue that productivity would increase fast enough if Greece was less corrupt and all that, but I think wages would outpace productivity gains in the end anyway.) Now the bubble burst and all hell broke loose. 

&gt; One final thing, Greeks are actually very entrepreneurial.

That's a stereotype that goes around a lot but I can't say how accurate it is.

&gt; The problem might even be that people don't trust the state

That's a very real problem. A lot of people use this excuse when they don't pay their taxes. I'm not sure how justified it is.

&gt; I've also heard that e.g truck drivers and pharmacists have lobbied themselves monopolies. All of these are just sneaky rent-seeking at the expense of the general public. 

Not exactly true. We call these ""closed professions"". There's a certain number of licenses and there's a market for them. This scheme is a remnant of the military junta, actually. The point is that, until recently, you couldn't open a pharmacy or do truck transfers without buying such a license from a previous holder. 

&gt; If public sector workers are squeezed enough they will also have to resort to bribes to supplement their income

This is already a problem. I thought it would go away after the country became more rich but it didn't. Then, I thought it needed more time, but I guess we will never know now.

&gt; Aren't Greece's tax inspectors semi-independent or something? I'd try to fix this first.

Simplified case. You have €500,000 in cash. You pay rent €12,000/year more than dues from the house you own.

1. if you buy house with that sum,  you save  €12,000/year in rent and  your wealth is probably protected from inflation. 
2. if you invest that sum and can get 4% yield above  inflation, you end up with yearly income of  €8,000 after you have paid the rent.

If you take into account that most people take mortgage and must pay that down, it changes the equation even more. Most people don't own the house until decades after they have bought it.

No, there is no substitute for the intimidation and stopping power of a gun.  The only issues are whether a person might draw a gun too readily - it should only be done in a life-or-death situation - and whether the attacker might take the gun from a person who hesitates too long.

Well the receiver of the benefit is going to be better off financially, because they're also paid by whoever they're working for. So they'd get 80e + their wages. Does it matter to them where the money comes from?

How much you pay to supplement their wage is a value judgement (so as long as the shift from unemployment benefit to working benefit happens, it's a more efficient system and I'm happy), but I guess I was thinking of two reasons:

1) Current low-wage people already working would also be eligible for the subsidy, so there'd need to be some savings or tax increase somewhere to pay for it in the short term. Part of the costs is obviously covered by people leaving UE benefit. In the long term there should be some growth from productivity + all kinds of savings as people become more socialised and more invested in society (so less money spent on policing, healthcare, various social problems). There's also intangible benefits for individuals like a greater sense of self-worth and more happiness, but I guess these are harder to quantify.

true,flyingkangaroo,null,null,"&gt; I'm reading the reactions and I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Am I?

That's called ""culture shock,"" I believe. People in the USA are raised up with a certain set of values. 

Here's a list of several:

One big value is the importance of opinion. There is no common set of principles or values which we adhere to, when discussing issues pertaining to our communities. Everybody can have an opinion about anything, and is free to state it. It does not have to be backed up by reason, nor does it have to be backed up by research. To criticize an unsupported opinion is considered rude and inappropriate. (American Redditors, because of their anonymity, feel a guilty pleasure in flouting that social rule).

Another value is individualism. People's lives go only as far as their workplace and their immediate family. People usually don't even know their next door neighbors... nor do they want to. They make a nice little bubble in which to live... and what happens outside of that bubble is only considered a problem in so much as it could impinge on what happens inside the bubble.

The belief in good and evil is very prominent in the USA as well. Even by simply reading the Associated Press newswire you can see that most articles about tragedies are written as if the reporter was writing a film noir script. It's as if reporters have pulled out a template from a file cabinet and are just filling in names and places and other details. Hollywood films and violent video games also show how Americans have trained themselves to think about the world. People nearly universally believe that there are bad apples out there who need to be stopped and imprisoned and who can't be reformed. This idea is supported by many American scientific models about biology and behavior. This kind of integrates into people's mindsets about needing to maintain order in their own personal lives, but not being able to have an influence outside of that bubble.

Because of the belief in good and evil, people strongly believe in national defense. What other country in the world spends the proportion of tax revenue on its military that the USA does? None.  Of course, European nations and the rest of the Western world is kind of ""codependent"" with us... that is to say you folks reinforce our vision of ourselves as ""knights in shining armor"" - other nations are complicit in supporting our predilection for military investment. Through NATO and the UN and other international treaties, other nations depend on the USA for their own national defense.

Then there is the belief in ""the American Dream,"" which basically necessitates a vast scope of income inequality in the nation. You need to have a vast discrepancy between minimum wage entry level jobs and the sums that upper management are paid, in order to have the monumental social mobility that people believe in, with all their heart, here in the USA. This works well with the American mindset that people who work hard are rewarded a lot, and those who work less need to live a more meager life.

One has to also remember that while there are many Americans who lecture their neighbors about the value of caring and sharing and working for the good of the community - in general, these are only values that Americans would like to believe in - not things that they can ever actually bring themselves to believe in. Instead, folks believe in getting on the corporate ladder... in working hard and earning a lot of money and building themselves a happy life with those resources.

Finally, one has to recognize that at a certain population size, a nation becomes so big that it becomes its own little world. It becomes ethnocentric. It becomes like a place with one-way glass walls where people in smaller adjacent nations can look in, but from within, people don't really look out closely at the wider world. Such a large nation has a range of ecosystems within it... and people see that there are many opportunities which can be had somewhere within the national borders. They don't see the need to look at how other smaller nations around them debate their own public policies, or how they choose to live their lives.

If you add all of those values together, you can see how people might begin to rationalize gun violence, and how they might not be able to see the social systems at work which seem so obvious to people in other Western nations where people have cooler minds in regards to public policy decisions.

On the other hand, from looking at this list, you might also see how the USA becomes a powerhouse of innovation and invention.

In politics, people have agendas. To further those agendas, it helps to have a target that invokes a strong emotional response. Therefore, they find a way to vilify a symbol for their cause.

Take the whole war on terror crap. Muslims, at least in the states, have been unjustly vilified. They have been turned into this horrible thing in the eyes of the general public, to the point where hate crimes are sprouting up. All to fuel the USofA's military industrial complex.

Assault riffles have been turned into this same type of boogey man, with respect to the whole political debate on guns in the states.

If you follow that childish emotional reaction, then, yes, guns and Muslims are bad!!!!

If you look at the raw data from a scientific or mathematical perspective (excising the emotional aspect), they aren't that bad at all. Muslims are people, just like anyone else, and assault riffles are just hunks of metal, wood, and polymers.

Kennesaw Georgia *requires* that every household maintain a gun, and the crime rate there is half the average of the overall US. Not 10% less, 50%.

Many places give criminals a slap on the wrist, and no rehab/job-training. With a crime record, they cannot get a job, so there is a slow steady slide from petty crime into more serious crime.

Unfortunately this also feeds into the conservative Americans fears. They want guns to protect themselves, because they feel unprotected by the city/state/fed government.

Just my perspective...the USA is so large, there is a great variation from one state/city to the next. One state is bicycle-friendly, medical marijuana is legal, low crime, etc...another state, you get prison for possession of half a joint, very high crime rate, hard to start a business...

Nobody would understand this better than a brilliant Prussian commander of the 18th century, when warfare was taking the leaps from ancient hand-held combat to explosions and formations. The heart of the problem that long-range weapons pose to a society is the perceived ""willingness"" to use these weapons and kill. However, the statistics tell a different story. As countries have become more modern and developed modern weapons, international violence has dropped tremendously. We live in the most peaceful time in humanities history - but academically, we cannot say this is because weapons are more long range, more likely democracy has spread and international opinions of peace weigh more heavily discouraging conflict among kings.   
  
From my experience of studying history, wars, regarding commitment of military servicemen into danger, no commander *wants* to see their men put in danger or killed. War is a nasty business and most people are sane-enough to avoid it by whatever means. But by the time war comes, it's a business that needs to run its course and be over with as soon as possible. Modern weaponry allows for that. Someone is going to die (that is the nature of war), but drudging it out in lines of swords is not morally superior to dropping a single bomb.   
  
The best example of ""dignity to a vulgar brawl"" is the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's absolutely terrible what happened to the civilians (and military personnel) of those cities, but so was the entirety of the war. So was the eastern campaign in Europe, so was the North-African campaign. But those bombs ironically saved lives as I'm sure you've heard the argument before. If US/Soviet troops has to take Hiroshima by land, they would have instead dropped thousands of bombs, sent hundreds/thousands of troops and vehicles and campaigned a ""vulgar brawl"" to take it. I fail to see how this could conceivably be superior to ending a nasty business with the most eloquence possible.  
  
You might make the argument that ranged weapons *""encourage""* killing as a civilian/criminal level, but at a state/international level it's done more good than bad.

Debt reduction would also be possible by printing money or expropriating the people, but those aren't long term solutions by themselves because they do not address structural problems and uneven distribution of wealth. Either way a reset, painful as it will be, is needed. If that's what we're in for, avoiding the inevitable will just make it more painful and longer lasting.

Making structural changes to the financial and political system would be utopian as it is right now because the banks are part of the government, so perhaps we would first need a government that is transparent, acts in the interest of the people and is immune to lobbyism/corruption. The pirate parties appear to be most exciting candidates as of yet.

First and foremost, it should be possible to revert the banking deregulation process even if we do not get an utopian government that acts in the interest of the people. Then (if we do get an honest goverment) we can address the problem that while banks are considered to be of ""systemic"" importance and have the power to create money and thus drive the entire economy and society, they are corporations which by definition need to maximize profits for themselves using any means they have. I do not have a readymade replacement but I believe that institutions which are required for the society to work should be public. Take the privilege to create money away from the banks or nationalize them.

Hold politicians and bankers accountable for financial crimes. Hold politicians accountable for their decisions in general. The derivatives market should be restricted significantly but I do not have specific suggestions at this point.

Even if there were valid statistics, proving that more people are hurt from gun accidents, than lives that are saved due to self defense. That wouldn't be a fair assessment. 

Number one, there are aspects of the equation that statistics wouldn't adequately capture. For example, there is the deterrent effect. Knowing that someone would probably shoot me if I invaded their home, is a big deterrent. I sure as hell would think twice about jumping through the window of someones home, if that were the case.

Furthermore, should the actions of a few, be responsible for depriving everyone the opportunity to defend themselves?

The guns we know about are in the hands of law-abiding citizens which carry permits and registration. Because of this, they are easy to find and are the only people we could effectively strip guns away from. After depriving them of guns, now everybody who didn't have registration, a license or permit (you know, those things that make sure you don't have any felonies or mental health issues) are the only ones with guns. Good job. I'm sure there will be absolutely no negative repercussions from this. 

&gt;Protecting you from the tyrannical government? Do you really think you'd survive 10 minutes if your government wants to build up a dictatorship? I just think about 20 rednecks with their guns standing in front of the white house and getting cut down by an army probably strong enough to invade Cuba.

I might not, but others will. And hell, I think we'd last ten years, probably more. Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, if these conflicts have shown us anything it's that a determined and armed foe on his home turf can put up one hell of a fight, even win the war, despite the fact that the enemy is better equipped and trained, or is more technologically advanced. Hell, we won the Revolutionary War, yet George Washington lost most of his battles and the British were better trained and better armed.

And let's remember that the concentration of guns in the United States is ten times (if not more) than any of those three countries I list above. Plus, unlike those countries, the people that use them here are better trained, with many being Ex-Military or Ex-Police. And those ""rednecks"" you make fun of, well, they have been practicing and hunting with those guns since they were wee little lads. 

You're also not taking into account how many soldiers would outright desert, taking their equipment and training with them, or the number who would refuse any orders to fire on fellow citizens.

[And a army probably strong enough to invade Cuba?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion) Eh...I'll take my chances.....

&gt;Which leads me to your next point. The holocaust. At first, you're an idiot for thinking that both periods are actually comparable. It took you 2 days to get from west to east Germany. 

I'm the idiot? You're the one who thinks **two days** is some kind of huge barrier. It took **two weeks** too get from New York to California. Two days isn't shit. 

&gt;There was no Internet, no affordable telephone, no mobile phone network. 

This is the **1930s**, not the **1800s**. You DID have telephones, telegraphs and mail, by your own admission, that only took TWO DAYS to get to it's destination. TWO DAYS! That's it! 

&gt;People in the west didn't know what was going on in the east and vice versa.

Once again, this is the **1930s**, not the **Cold War**. You were a united country. Not a divided one. You had phones, telegraphs and a organized postal service, which once again, by your own admission, would've only took two days to deliver a piece of mail or news from one side of the country to another. 

&gt;So... Nazis everywhere. Ready to shot you as soon as you get their attention in a negative way and you really expect those people to start a riot? With nazis around that would know that there is probably one weapon in every 5th household? There were riots. There were resistants.

It could very well be that there were a lot of guns in private hands.

What riots? What resistance? Don't try to whitewash history. Hitler was looked at as a godsend to your country after the ass-fucking with the Treaty of Versailles (which, I admit, was unfair as shit), but that shouldn't excuse the *willful ignorance* that permeated through German society at the time. And don't tell me that ""nobody knew"", because that's bullshit, Mien Kampf was published before Hiter was even in office and his speeches spell out his intentions well enough if you have ever actually listened to them. 

But hey, it didn't matter, because he took a broke, defeated Germany with a huge unemployment rate to a wealthy, proud Germany where everybody was able to find a job. My opinion is that the general attitude was, ""Hey, who cares if people start going missing, as long as I still have my job everything is cool.""

And I wasn't implying that things would've changed if more White Germans had guns, because it probably wouldn't have, the White German people loved Hitler too much at this point in time. He was a popular leader, hell, he didn't even have to rig his election if didn't want too. No, I was saying there would be a difference if the **german gypsies and jews had more guns**, that's my point. Sure, your normal German might not get himself killed in a riot/resistance, but the average Jew or Gypsy, who was faced with Death or Death, probably would've.

So just to be clear; C4, nuclear explosives, and anti-air weapons should all be available for civilian purchase? And in the case that someone misuses them, then we should punish the person?

No.  It is a crazy thing indeed.  Your average American is absolutely prepared to live with a much higher homicide rate in return for the ""freedumb"" to own guns.

Americans are obsessed with freedom, but don't really have any.  Walk down the street with a beer in your hand?  Not a problem in most countries.  Banned in American parks and virtually everywhere else.  Want to travel by major transport domestically?  Better be ready for some of the most invasive and degrading ""security checks"" possible.  This goes double if you're flying.  Highest incarceration rate in the *entire* world, both per capita and total.  The US has more prisoners than China, a nation of more than one billion people.  Just think about that for a minute if you will.

I would definitely agree that even as an American, it is difficult for me to wrap my head around the fact that we have very few rights, especially as workers and consumers, but will fight tooth and nail to ensure that we make it easy for the average person to repeat what just happened in Colorado, and this little episode won't change that.

The OP said ""I don't want to start the usual ""yurop is better, durrr"" circlejerk..""

I was born, raised, and lived in the US virtually my whole life, and I DO want to start that conversation.

Many European (and developed) countries ARE much better than the US in quite a few respects.  That is the truth, and there is nothing wrong with telling the truth.

true,El-Wrongo,GNLD,Greenland,"You are ignoring the fact that places that have strict gun control laws generally have it implemented in a attempt to bring gun violence under control. Generally speaking the more violent states and cities in the U.S. have big minority communities. New Orleans, DC, Baltimore, New York, Los Angeles all have lots of violence, lots of minorities and strict gun control laws. 

Minorities in these areas have been discriminated, causing poverty disenfranchisement which in turn cause some among them to turn to avenues that they normally wouldn't turn to. Avenues that have huge profit margins and require relatively small amount of capital input, as capital is generally not widely available among the poor. In the 1920s this was the illegal sale and trafficking of alcohol. The Irish and the Italians were the ones doing this, as they were discriminated against, poor, but had enough freedom of movement to actually pull it off. Black people and Mexicans couldn't actually pull it off, as they were living under a apartheid like situation, where killing a few of them to steal their alcohol was mostly a profitable venture if you yourself were white. During prohibition Irish and Italian gangs were responsible for a lot of the violence plaguing parts of America, as rival crews attempted to gain a advantage against the competition.

These days alcohol is legal, and doesn't provide the huge profit margins it did during prohibition, but poor black people and Mexicans have another avenue to pursue in drugs. However to sell drugs you need territory. A corner to stand on, a high rise or courtyard to sell from, much like the speakeasies during prohibition. If you sell drugs you are operating in a space outside of the law. You can't drag someone to court to make sure you receive payment for your product. You can't call the police to report someone robbing you of your product. Territory is held by whoever has the muscle to hold it. This means if you sell drugs, you have to enforce any rules you want to enforce and you have to claim the territory to sell the drugs on. If someone is standing on a corner you want, you have to move them of the corner. If someone robs you, you have to settle the score yourself. This is more easily done with a gun than with any other implement, causing gun violence. The gun violence means politicians who want to be relected get their panties in a bunch, causing them to enact gun laws to counter the gun violence. 

Whether or not the gun laws are the correct counter is another question tough.

As for the 'wal-mart down the street argument', there are just so many holes I don't know where to begin. I'd say it'd be easier to order the weapons off the internet than to even go down to your local gun shop, which most large cities probably have near 20 at least. So I mean I could mosey on down to gander mountain as the Aurora Shooter did, or I could order my weapons from the internet as I believe the Columbine Shooters did(if my memory serves me correctly). The point is, it doesn't really matter where he got the firearms. If he wanted them, he would have obtained them. He was a Phd student. Why would ANYONE believe that he SHOULDN'T have been able to own a gun. He had no prior record - or else he wouldn't have been able to purchase the weapons - and was by most standards your average American. 

What it really comes down to is identifying these so called 'nutjobs'. This bring me back to my original point in that, any one can snap making it nearly impossible to find said nutjobs. [Andrew Stack](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/us/19crash.html) was 53 years old when he crashed a plane into an IRS building because he had hang-ups with the government agency. But this nutjob, they let him get his pilots license. OH MAN! In the post 9-11 world we ALL know a pilots license is probably a thousand times more dangerous for a nutjob than owning a gun.

Your post conflates a lot of arguments into a fairly confusing soup, here is how I, as an American and resident of Canada feel about some of the points you raised:

First, the murder rate in parts of the states is bad, but I do not think you can correlate this violence to gun control or a lack thereof. [Here](http://geoggeol.mansfield.edu/media/images/crime-rate-map.jpg) is a map of the crime rate. First, notice that it's mostly falling. There have been some gun control laws passed at the state level, but there have also been some significant relaxations of the law.

My home state, for instance, now allows people to ""conceal and carry"" a hand gun for their own protection. That in itself is kind of stupid, but it has not resulted in the kind of gun violence that you see in other states. I would argue that it will not either, the only thing that causes that kind of violence is high populations **and** poverty.

So I'm not opposed to gun control because I think it's important for people to own all manner of guns. I'm opposed to it because it won't make anyone safer. It will just cost us money and make some gun hobbyists paranoid and bitter.

I live in a very safe city right now (Vancouver, BC, Canada).  It's safe because of some great harm reduction programs that are in place to deal with low level drug addicts, and because of the stupid amount of money drifting into the city's real estate market. People are comfortable enough and safe enough so there is no gun culture, and thus no guns, no need for explicit regulation.

How can you go about proving your mental stability? People who are mentally unstable in many cases won't out themselves. People with depression and anxiety a lot of times go for years denying treatment and denying their illness, even though they feel the effects daily.

This is not a US specific problem. I would say based on population that the amount of mass-shootings like this are no more common in the United States than Europe.

The rest of gun violence is an outgrowth of criminal enterprises or accidents. The point is though that the type of person that's determined to cause maximum harm like the aurora shooter or Breivik is going to go to extremes to do so. They are not the type of person that would be deterred with laws prohibiting guns. 

Furthermore. In the US there are already so many guns that it is downright impossible to enforce any type of anti-gun legislation. Chicago, Illinois has some of the strictest gun laws in the United States. It's not legal to own a gun anywhere in the city, for any reason (unless you're a cop). Yet, Chicago consistently has one of the highest homicide rates in the nation. 

Also Consider this. There are millions upon millions of gun owners in America. I don't think the majority of the population owns guns, but a near-majority does at the very least. The point is that many, many, many Americans own guns, but most of them never use them or go on crazy killing sprees like this. Plenty of people have no problem being a responsible gun owner. In fact, 99% of gun owners are very responsible. Should they be denied the right to protect themselves because 1% of the population is nuts? Keep in mind that if guns were illegal those who were still VERY determined to get their hands on them could.

&gt;Don't hide behind it, if you think everyone has the right to own assault rifles say it. Don't say 'the founders believed everyone has the right...'

Most people aren't saying this. I can't even believe you think that most Americans think this. This is overgeneralizing in the extreme. 

The problem with banning assault rifles is that by banning a particular model you end up with people modifying weapons that can then become semi or fully automatic weapons. One weapon is banned for being semi-automatic, and another very similar one with a different grip isn't. 

Even beyond these legal issues, there are huge social \ societal ones.  

-If you ban assault rifles for civilians, that means the police generally can not have them either. The police are then bringing handguns to an assault rifle fight when the criminals show up. You say: Okay! Make an exception for the police. Then you're allowing an easier chance for those same weapons to get into civilian hands. You're also arming your police force to the teeth which Americans don't trust in the first place. I'm sure you could possibly toss all these issues out the window and dismiss them, but seriously fucking consider the consequences - intended or unintended.

-Police can not be everywhere at once. There is a man in your house stealing your shit, and possibly putting your family at danger. Would you like to roll the dice with your life and the life of your loved ones by calling the police and hoping they show up OR would you rather do that AND have the option to defend yourself if need be? 

-Unlike in Europe there is a huge amount of gamelife to be hunted. It isn't a sport so much as a way of life for many people. Our hunting season is a LOT shorter here than it is there - why? We want the wildlife to grow back so we can hunt. *I* personally don't find this way of life to be all that interesting, but who the fuck am I to tell people who have done that their *entire lives* how to live? And remember, banning subsections of guns (shotguns, handguns, rifles, assault rifles, etc) - many weapons can be converted or changed either in a makeshift or professional way into another class. It's amazing what you can do with a can-do attitude, a bit of knowledge, and access to parts.

I haven't really been following the whole reaction to this event, I certainly didn't mean to extrapolate to all Americans. I was mainly commenting on that thread in particular. That was the first 'american' thread I had really looked at. [This comment thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/wys8n/jason_alexander_on_aurora/c5hnz0u) and [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/wys8n/jason_alexander_on_aurora/c5hnpnf) make up a large proportion of the comments in there and they are both just talking about interpreting the 2nd amendment. In earlier events (Virginia tech for example which I followed a bit more closely) there are arguments on both sides of gun control that are just interpreting the 2nd amendment differently.

I just don't agree with that type of law making. A good law now may not a good law in 200 years. Yes laws shouldn't be changed on a whim or in a knee-jerk response but even though the US constitution is a fantastic basis for laws the writers could not have imagined the 21st century. I just find it silly that someone would argue the point by citing a guy that died 200 years ago. One* should argue what the law **should** be not what it is.

You make some very good points in the second part of your comment, especially about trust which I think is very central to the whole argument, but I was mainly trying to make the point about how they were arguing their position, not what their position was.

They are misunderstood people who need our help. I would have invited them home, fed them and gave them some money too. :D

Thanks for belittling a perfectly valid point. A robber who kills people is not a robber anymore. Why would a robber kill people who pose no danger to them? Look at the first video, the robbers did not have a loaded gun, the weren't there to kill people. 

Lastly, robbers wouldn't be so agressive if they didn't expect every household to be armed. It's basically like an arms race. Robbers start with knives and homeowners get bats, robbers follow with a pistol and the homeowner get a shotgun. Now robbers come with full military gear. If you think the best response to crime is brute force you're sadly mistaken. It's not like other people in other countries are just staying at home and getting raped/killed.

I'm not a thief so can't answer the question, but fact is, many people died while being robbed.

Matter of fact, my friend's dad was killed in a robbery attempt in Dallas while entering a 7/11. He walked in the store while the store was being robbed, the thief got startled and shot my friend's father in the chest, and ran out. Dude was never caught and ended up not taking shit, but killed an innocent person.

Why did that thief killed the person entering the store and not the cashier who had the money?

And as far as the paranoia...every every state has different cities with different neighborhoods with different views on crime.  Some places have no concerns about crimes as they are safe neighborhoods, while others (south chicago for example), are a war zone every day.

Not everyone lives under paranoia, unless you live in specific areas.

But to assume that a thief is not going to kill, rape or maim somebody is somewhat unrealistic. Just like I can't assume every thief is going to kill a person, you can't tell me, the thief will just enter the home, rob the place and do nothing else.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; edit: I've been told that Sweden and Switzerland have lots of guns per capita, is that somewhat true, or is that overstated?

Yes.  Switzerland here, spent a lot of time living in the US, also gun owner in favor of lax firearms regulation.  I won't go into ""why"" unless someone's curious, but you've heard all the reasons before.

France also has a comparatively high rate of gun ownership.

The ease of obtaining firearms is definitely a factor in the use of guns in crimes.  What a lot of people miss, though, is that the major factors by far are socioeconomic.  Education, political stability, cultural mix, prosperity, history, all of these contribute _vastly_ to the probability whether you'll have shootings or not.

Switzerland's gun ownership is mostly (not entirely) due to the military, and guns are seen less as a self-defense method than as a common-defense tool.  The country is also very very very very very stable, prosperous, well educated, yada yada.    And yet, we have had shootings in the past - mainly murder-suicides, but also a fair share of crimes and the horrible massacre in one of the cantonal parliaments a while ago.  

In any society, the occasional person will flip their shit, it's inevitable - there are basically five stages to limiting the damage from this:

- prevent this from happening in the first place (make sure as many people as possible are happy and healthy)
- detect craziness and treat it
- prevent crazy people from accessing deadly weapons
- prevent armed crazy people from using their deadly weapons
- defend actively against armed crazy people

Each of these, in increasing order, involves tradeoffs.  It's a fact of life.  

I like to reply to the demand for stricter gun laws with the fact that, according to UK crime statistics, gun crimes of all kinds actually rose between the 1997 firearms act amendment and 2007, before falling again.  And strict (and inconsistent) gun laws did not stop events like the 2007 Duisburg mafia massacre.

Sadly, people focus on what they want to see.  There's very little rational thinking in the gun debate.",0,1343037509,null,0,false,0,c5i1jyt,t3_wz629,t1_c5i1jyt,t1_c5hvcld,null,1429446164,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

Most would raise an objection to that.  We have many devices that use the same principles as firearms but that aren't created for that reason. But yes, I understand your point.

Frankly, also speaking as a brit, I wouldn't have an objection repealing the handgun laws here *for purposes of sport* and as you say, heavily regulated.  
I find it asinine that we are hosting a pistol event at the olympics and have created an indoor arena for this, when our pistol team have to practise outside the UK.  

I am currently looking at taking up target shooting once again, and would be gong for the largebore comps using a Lee-Enfield, but I expect that it will be quite expensive with regard to licensing and regulation but I'm prepared to accept that as a necessary cost.  
As such I do argue for firearm ownership but I'm much more rational about claiming what reasons would motivate me to own one.

As for permits and the constitution in the US, it discusses bearing arms with relation to militias.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"It's not really about increased interest rates per se, it's about underwriting debt without having any control over the spending. That is, national governments in one country would make decision that would ultimately affect those everywhere else.

Greece is the poster child for this risk, but it's by no means alone in this. Times change, economies change, society changes. This happens constantly, and this is reflected in governments' budgets. New programs need to be created and old ones expanded all the time, that's why new budgets are written every year. But you can't just spend more money on one thing without either increasing your income (taxes) or cutting expenses elsewhere. And that's unpopular, something democratic governments like to put off and leave to their successors, while it's the opposite with the expansion part. Talk to an expert in any area and she'll tell you government spending in that particular area is too low and urgently needs to be raised. Practically all of them are probably right. We need to spend more on education, on science, infrastructure, social policies and welfare. The list goes on. Budgets have a natural tendency to grow, no matter how efficient the underlying bureaucracy is, with or without catering to the clienteles of the parties in power.

There are only two mechanisms that limit budget growth and force politicians to eventually make unpopular cuts to the least urgent chunks of the budget -- that tax increases are even more unpopular, and that too high debt levels result in higher interest rates that at some point begin to fuel themselves. Evidently, this risk was not enough to keep the Greek government from overspending.

Stop ripping it out of context. From the outside (before people knew what was going to happen) the police in the US and the Gestapo look similar. Breaking into houses without identifying themselves and shooting people? Arresting people for wanting to complain? Let people go that shoot a black dude in a hoody and with fucking sweets in his hand? Corruption that allows those cops to get a month paid holiday until they go on duty again? That sounds a lot like what would I expect from the Gestapo.

2) Depreciation will let these countries become more competitive again vs Northern europe and the rest of the world.

3) If you are an investor you can hedge your currency exposure, institutions do this every day for currencies around the world, it isn't hard.

4) Countries (like the Chinese) will be much more willing to buy their debt knowing that these changes have taken place, because they offer an actual solution to the core problems which have been dogging europe for two years now.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; According to Wolfgang Höpken, professor of southeastern European history at the University of Leipzig, these ""democratic deficits"" are partially due to the countries' limited experience with maintaining democratic systems.
Höpken pointed out that even before World War Two, Bulgaria and Romania lacked strong democratic foundations. Later, when they were part of the Eastern Bloc, their Communist regimes only exacerbated the problem by creating mistrust in public institutions.
After the fall of the Iron Curtain, Bulgaria and Romania faced the unique challenge of reforming their economic and political systems at the same time.
""This presented a great hurdle for these societies,"" Höpken said. ""Expecting flawless democratic order to set in immediately would have been naive.""

That is very true and is ultimately the cause of all the problems. No wonder it comes from a historian and not  from an economist. I still believe that we could have been more successful at this whole thing had we approached the fall of the Berlin Wall with the Chinese model (reform of the economic system first and foremost).

But hell, did we NOT have any choice in any of this. When you look at it, Bulgarians have never played an important role in what happens with them since the 1880s.

Biggest cities in Poland were like 30% Jewish. My city had Jewish hospital, university, many high schools, etc. Jews had their own regional parliament in most bigger cities, had the right to collect taxes among themselves and only their leaders paid these collected taxes to Polish budget, etc, etc.

The source of antisemitism then (apart from stupidity and xenofoby, obviously) was that Jews often monopolized whole branches of industry and trade in cities where there have been many of them. Banking was traditionaly Jewish trade there (because Catholics were forbidden to lend money with interest rate). So they had money, they had educated youth (literacy among Jews was always very high) and they were mainly doing business with each other. Thanks to control over big percentage of credit money they could influence other industries, for example by not financing potential competition to other Jews. Poles were infuriated by that. Jews were infuriated because of persecution and xenofoby (for example there was quota for Jews on university, only so many of them were allowed each year).

Of course that's a big generalization, reality was much more complex. There were Jewish units in Polish army and in the insurgents that fought for Polish independence in 1831, 1861, 1918, in war with USSR in 1920 and in war againsti Germany and USSR in 1939. Polish elites were divided - one side (the majority in government) were neutral to Jews (Józef Piłsudski and his people) and in effect protected them from persecution most of the time. The other side were anti-semitists (Roman Dmowski and his people). They weren't as radical as Nazi (nobody proposed killing Jews in Poland), but there were serious propositions to expel Jews to Madagascar :/ . Fortunately they never were in power in Poland, always just in oposition.

Many Jews integrated. Most of Jews weren't rich and didn't participated in financial cartels(besides - there's nothing illegal in only financing people you like, even if it makes it very hard to compete with you), and that certainly wasn't good enough excuse to hate them. That's why I think anti-Muslim and anti-Roma sentiments are exactly as stupid as anti-semitism from pre-WW2 era. There are real reasons to don't like Roma, but when people learn it's ok to hate all the Roma becaus of these stereotypes - it's similiar to what happened before WW2.

It's referring not only to the fact that yes, the waste we currently generate is permanently noxious for all of eternity, give or take a couple of millennia (which is clearly unacceptable). It also encompasses the amount of waste first and foremost, and how to deal with it. 

Obviously we need to find a storage solution that doesn't involve haphazardly encapsulating noxious items in fragile containers and burying those in our collective front yards as surprise presents to our offspring. If that.  

Obviously we should try our hardest to design a reactor that does not produce waste, or as little as possible. 

Obviously we need to find a way to deal with contamination that doesn't involve breaking down and then rotating things at high speeds.

Obviously we need to look into how the waste we absolutely have to produce is handled uniformly and responsibly, not by every country as it pleases, but worldwide.

There is a whole throng of problems here. This isn't even beginning to scratch the surface. ""Waste issue"" means *everything* related to the generation, transport, disposal, possible recycling, (...) of said waste. 

It is an incredibly broad term, but it's also an incredibly complex issue, and if humanity as a whole wishes to continue using these types of reactors we need to seriously step up our game in research and engineering related to all of those areas. Which is something we have been neglecting, and which makes nuclear energy so ridiculously cheap. 

Just dropping those little gold nuggets down some mine shaft or chasm in the sea is cheap, and quick, but certainly not a solution.

&gt;It's to do with climate. Once air conditioning became cheap, the American South suddenly put on a spurt of growth. Prior to that they struggled because it was impossible to work in the heat and humidity (and if you doubt this, visit Florida in the high summer and see how unbearable it is outside). It's also notable that southern Europe simply doesn't use as much air-conditioning as they need and nowhere near as much as the Americans, thanks to EU regulations on saving energy.

&gt;In hot climates you are constantly getting dehydrated which causes exhaustion. In extreme places like sub-saharan africa the temperatures are so fierce that you'd die if you tried to work outside past mid-day. Once they can afford air conditioning they too will suddenly put on a growth spurt.

&gt;Of course extreme cold hinders you too - it's the reason Siberia isn't as rich as western Russia, and the reason why the Scandinavians were backward backwaters till they invented affordable central heating in the 20th Century, and then they suddenly put on a growth spurt.

The Democrats??  No. You're way off base.  Democrats conceded defeat on the gun issue almost 20 years ago. Even then the type of things they were asking for were gun locks, registration, background checks, and banning specific type of firearms, ammunition and magazines they deem to be too dangerous or too powerful.  It is the state and city leaders of **both parties** from the largest urban areas like New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and Chicago who still fight the fight for gun control and try to ban handguns.  

We had a beloved sitting congresswoman shot in the head from close range and almost killed during a spree in which the shooter used and extended round magazine last year and nothing changed. 

You've bought into the lie that the NRA uses to keep getting people's money.  The lie is that Democrats want to take away your guns.  Democrats don't give two shits about the gun control unless they are on the NRA side(which a significant amount of them are).

I'd wager the majority of Democrats believe that people should be allowed to own guns for ""sport"" and personal protection.  And a few of them even on the extreme left share the view that guns are needed in case of a revolution or invasion believe it or not.  We just want sensible laws and restrictions and we want to absolutely keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally unstable.

true,ThatLeviathan,null,null,"The problem from my perspective is that people are taking an extremely complicated issue and boiling it down to ""if guns hadn't been available, that guy couldn't have shot those people.""  In a perfect world, that's obviously true, but nothing happens in a vacuum.  The Aurora shooting was a statistical anomaly.  Thousands of people are killed with guns every year (most of them accidents or suicides, of course) but because of the media response to the latest tragedy, gun control is back in the spotlight.

If we really want to have a conversation about gun control, we have to take into account ALL the variables, not just one crazy mfer.  For example, let's say that ""assault weapons"" (which is really just a media phrase for any high-powered rifle that looks scary) had been banned in Colorado.  Could the perp have done just as much damage with a simple semi-automatic pistol?  Probably. Okay, so do we ban all semi-automatic weapons (as Mayor Bloomberg of NYC suggests)?  Fine, but then we have to examine what the complete consequences of that action would be, which means we need to take into account not just the times where a semi-automatic weapon was used to kill innocent people, but the times where a semi-automatic weapon was used to save lives.  Which is difficult to count because it's difficult to define: do we count just situations where a criminal was actually shot by a citizen in self-defense?  Do we also include situations where a citizen merely drew his weapon and the perp ran off without anyone firing a shot?  Do we include situations where a perp was simply deterred from robbing or burglarizing someone because he worried that the victim might be armed?  Estimates for the number of times crime was stopped by the presence of a gun are FAR higher than the number of times a gun was used in a crime, even by Handgun Control Inc.'s numbers.

When you compare gun laws, you have to keep in mind that while America's FEDERAL gun legislation may not be as restrictive as the rest of the world, state and city restrictions are very different.  American cities, where most gun violence actually occurs, usually have far more gun control than rural areas.  I don't suggest in this situation that the sole cause of gun violence is gun control, but it's obvious that there are more factors in play here than simply ""availability of guns.""

If America has a crime problem, the causes are extremely complex, and almost always rooted in poverty.  Well-fed, healthy, well-educated people tend not to shoot each other in stupid domestic disputes, no matter how many guns happen to be available.  I admit that having ready and easy access to guns makes things like the Aurora tragedy more likely, but then, how many times this year will a drunk driver take out an entire family?  A lot more than once or twice, I bet.  It would be awfully silly to make it illegal to drink alcohol, or drive cars, just so we don't have to read about sad media-hyped stories.

John Lott studied gun control back in the 90s (check his book ""More Guns, Less Crime"") and discovered that gun control legislation at the state and local level didn't seem to reduce crime, and in some places actually increased it.  His explanation for this was simple: criminals fear an armed populace.  When you get rid of guns, you get rid of that fear.  So while getting rid of all the legal guns in a community makes everyone FEEL safer, from statistical perspective it doesn't do much to help, and may actually REDUCE that safety.

TL;DR: banning legal guns will make tragedies like Aurora and Columbine much less likely, but will make us all much less safer from more common crime.",0,1343056811,null,0,false,0,c5i4fnb,t3_wz629,t1_c5i4fnb,t3_wz629,null,1429447521,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Culture shock happens for a reason. It's because there are common values in a country which you, as a foreigner, are not accustomed to. I went to Germany as an exchange student years ago and I felt culture shock both being there, and upon coming home. In order to understand what's happening, you need to understand what undergirds people's attitudes and approaches to life. It's an illusion that people are homogenous in their lifestyles across Western countries. The allusion that I use is the science fiction notion of ""parallel universes."" Things may seem the same on the surface, but underneath it all, different core values and approaches to life govern people's behavior.

As the distraught person who asked the original question indicates, it can be very disturbing to see how large groups of people think and talk about certain subjects if you don't understand these cultural differences. I've now lived over forty years in this my country of the USA, in many places within it - and what I've written is an attempt to explain the American mindset to a foreigner. Other countries have pros and cons to their zeitgeists as well, but the variety in the world in approaches to life is seen when you cross international borders. It is not as prominently found between ethnic groups in any given nation. It's about how you think, not about how you look, physically. In a country like Afghanistan or one in Africa where there isn't mandatory public schooling for every kid, you'll see lots of variety in how people think. In Western countries you'll see mostly similarities between how citizens of the same country think. The black, hispanic and white kids all go to the same school, and they get enculturated with the same values. Also, the mass media within any given country helps to reinforce those common sensibilities.

""So the patriots are correct, gun ownership is in the constitution - if you're in a well-regulated militia. Let's see what no less a statesman than Alexander Hamilton had to say about a militia:

""A tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice. It is not a day, or even a week, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss.""

Or from Merriam-Webster dictionary:
Definition of MILITIA
1
a : a part of the organized armed forces of a country liable to call only in emergency
b : a body of citizens organized for military service
2
: the whole body of able-bodied male citizens declared by law as being subject to call to military serviceThe advocates of guns who claim patriotism and the rights of the 2nd Amendment - are they in well-regulated militias? For the vast majority - the answer is no.""

I feel the methods of documentation back then, were less than perfect and maybe most things could/would not be recorded/known to everyone. I have here some of the current recorded ongoing wars - http://www.warsintheworld.com/?page=static1258254223 which is classified as a war with 1000+ deaths per year.

I feel the largest reason why your argument should not hold up is because while it may seem that the ""number"" of strifes and battles might have gone down, the casualities are much more than just number of deaths which is higher too (61 million [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties] in just world war II fought for ~8 years which I would consider a war fought without swords and with guns and bombs). People still show (admittedly mild) signs of radiation posioning. In essence we are attacking people who arent even born yet; such are the real effects of modern war. People who might have not had any part of the ideology that dragged them into this war. For example, when USA bombed Afghanistan in the hunt for Osama, there were many more civilian causalities as a result of the bombings. To bring up a parallel universe scenario, if the same war had to be fought with swords, at least the sides on the battlefield would be people who wanted to protect him vs the people hunting him down, not people who live in the general area of where intelligence findings say he might live.
All bombs do, is minimize the attackers' immediate losses. Countries don't see as many immediate repercussions save the later economic strain it puts on the country waging it and even that, might be better managed.
I believe all guns and bombs do, is make it easier to start/wage war after all.

Your final scenario, is barely even an argument if you could call it that. You pit the worst extreme against the other. It would be like me ending my argument, saying I would rather be sliced in half in one quick sword slash rather than die an excruciating pain from paralysis as the bullet is lodged in my spine. It's just pitting an extreme scenario against a more favorable and likable one.

The real question is, why do we think civilized brawls are any better? They are just better in appearance...lesser blood out of the same number of people dying.
