&gt; The debate raging over Greece's place in the euro zone has obscured an important fact: Many of the most painful steps of the Greek bailout have already been completed.

&gt;That has implications for how euro-zone authorities respond to the antibailout backlash in Greece. Why, after two arduous years of negotiations, austerity and halting progress, would the euro zone risk the chaos created by a Greek exit if the government doesn't follow the bailout program as promised?

&gt;Consider what has been accomplished. Greece has cut its budget deficit sharply; its budget deficit excluding interest payments isn't far from balance. Euro-zone politicians, defying domestic opposition, have put together two enormous bailouts for the government and engineered an ambitious restructuring of its debt, all to keep Greece from dropping the euro.

&gt;The toughest question left is Greece's remaining debt, which will increasingly be held by euro-zone governments. The line from European officialdom is that Greece must repay this debt as foreseen by the bailout program. After all, Greece and its private-sector creditors just spent months negotiating a debt exchange that more than halved the value of their Greek bonds. That wasn't enough?

&gt;Markets don't think so. Greek 10-year bond yields were 18% right after the exchange in March. Yields like that imply a significant risk of default.

&gt;It isn't hard to see why. The bailout envisions Greece with debt at 120% of gross domestic product in 2020, still very high. And many economists believe the assumptions made by the ""troika"" of the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank in the second bailout—for example, that the Greek economy would contract only 4.7% this year—are too optimistic.

&gt;""Take the troika's forecasts of Greek GDP with a hefty pinch of salt, because the economy is in free fall,"" said Simon Tilford, an economist at the Centre for European Reform in London. Greek GDP fell 6.2% in the first quarter, the Greek statistics agency said this week.

&gt;If growth continues to underperform expectations, Greece's debt won't be much lower in 2020 than it is today.

&gt;""There will be have to be haircuts on the loans made to Greece by the euro-zone governments,"" Mr. Tilford said.

&gt;Another cut to the interest rate on these loans, valued at about €52.9 billion ($67.3 billion), could be the first step, said one euro-zone official involved in the discussions.

&gt;Most analysts and investors agree Greece's remaining debt won't be repaid in full, whether it stays in the currency area or leaves it.

&gt;But wouldn't forgiving more of Greece's debt be a reward for bad behavior? It depends how you look at it. Greece has missed plenty of budget targets, but over the past two years, the government has cut its primary deficit—the budget deficit excluding interest payments—to 2.2% of GDP in 2011 from 10.6% in 2009.

&gt;That is a huge amount of austerity undertaken amid economic headwinds that make deficit cutting particularly hard. Greece's primary deficit is now smaller than those of several other countries in the euro zone, including France, the Netherlands, Spain and Luxembourg.

&gt;Greece now needs its creditors much less to pay pensions, civil-servant salaries and otherwise fund the operations of the government. Most lending from the euro zone and the IMF is now going to pay interest on existing debt, which will increasingly be owned by the euro zone itself, rather than fund the government's operating expenses.

&gt;More cuts and overhauls are needed, particularly to improve Greek competitiveness, but that is a significant accomplishment, given how dysfunctional Greece's budgeting was when the bailout began. More debt forgiveness could be the euro zone's reward to Greece for a tough job, more-or-less well done.

&gt;But if the euro zone insists that Greece follow the bailout, the government's relatively small primary balance makes life outside the euro zone more feasible. Greece would default on its debt and adopt its own currency with its government spending and revenue roughly in line.

&gt;While that would be a painful step for Greece, it might be even worse for the rest of the euro zone.

&gt;""The contagion then to the rest of the euro zone would be very grave,"" Mr. Tilford said. ""It's clear from what we've seen in Spain and asset prices across the south over the past week that the contagion risk is very clear.""

&gt;Bailouts for Spain and Italy might be required, dwarfing the cost of keeping Greece in the euro-zone fold and possibly fracturing the currency area. That should make the game of chicken euro-zone politicians are playing with the recession-weary Greek public look much less appealing.",0,1337306078,null,0,false,0,c4pdasy,t3_tsmho,t1_c4pdasy,t3_tsmho,null,1428948292,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Tu fais un amalgame complet entre manifestation et laïcité.
Si demain je souhaite réaliser une marche en l'honneur du pastafarisme, j'ai le droit.

Tiens toi qui aime la loi:

Selon le décret loi du 23/10/1935, pour pouvoir exercer son droit de manifester, il faut faire une déclaration préalable, car «sont soumis à l’obligation d’une déclaration préalable, tous cortèges, défilés et rassemblements de personnes et d’une façon générale toutes les manifestations sur la voie publique».
Cette déclaration doit être faite soit à la préfecture de police, soit à la mairie dans les communes où la police n’est pas étatisée. Il faut noter que cette déclaration préalable doit être faite auprès des préfectures ou des mairies de toutes les communes qui seront traversées par la manifestation.


La religion n'est en aucun en rapport avec ce droit. Il y eu des manifestations juives comme musulmanes en France. Et heureusement qu'elles ne sont pas interdites.

true,captainhamster,EURO,Special Snowflake,"Personally I would welcome a withdrawal of U.S. military bases. I too have often heard the argument that 'our military allows your social democracy' and I believe it to be nonsense. Most European countries have militaries of their own that do just fine, I honestly don't see some country or the whole continent suddenly being overtly invaded if the US removes personnel. I would be genuinely curious to see how the US contributes to EU and European defence budgets, as to my understanding this is only through 'renting' the military bases they have.

The problem with the US lessening military integration with European countries would be a potential loss of close relations and economic downturn in the towns where the bases are stationed. I don't think there would be a significant decrease in security seeing as most threats nowadays seem to be asymmetrical. Asymmetrical threats largely require intelligence and information services to combat, and the sharing of that kind of information won't stop as it is mutually beneficial and frankly necessary.

The benefits of the US decreasing or removing their military presence in Europe would be the removal of a relic of the cold war, more independence, and in my view actually more safety. The US leaders can complain all they want about European actions in Afghanistan, the fact remains that the overwhelming majority of people here don't seem to want to be there, don't want the war, and will only support 'reconstruction' like missions, not actively hostile ones. I'm quite tired of European military leaders wanting to impress the US, as most civilian folk don't give a shite. Many societies here are not militarily minded, we don't want it to be a priority, and the sooner this would happen the better.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;Some of the rhetoric surrounding this issue has been rather anti-European: for example, one senior US military spokesman quoted on NPR this morning said that European officers are reluctant to fight or put themselves in harm's way in Afghanistan; he basically called them cowards[.]

At least Finland, Norway and Sweden are in Afganistan for strictly peacekeeping, I imagine this goes for several other European countries there as well. The troops are not supposed to get into fights. Using guns is the last resort after you have taken cover and can't get the other person to stop shooting otherwise (situation on the ground might be different, but that's how the orders were when they left home).

The job isn't really made easier by American troops killing reporters and civilians, burning Korans and otherwise acting like dicks. 

&gt;I've heard fellow Americans gripe that the only reason Europeans can afford social democracies with programs like national health is because American taxpayers foot most of their defense bills - Europe doesn't have to pay the full cost of defending itself, the argument goes, so it can therefore afford ""luxurious"" social programs.

European nations can afford social programs because we vote political leaders who think social programs are worth more than tax cuts. That's the primary reason.

Far, far behind that one comes the fact that it's far cheaper to only wage wars with the permission of The United Nations Security Council.

&gt;It reminded me of the anti-Europe insults spouted by Rumsfeld, like when he referred to France and Germany as ""old Europe."" 

I suppose this refers to the time when France and Germany didn't want America to attack Iraq without some evidence of WMD's, the WTC plot and/or Iraq preparing for war.

&gt;More seriously, Europe has nuclear weapons and elite fighting units; while it might not maintain enough force to fight a major land war or invade foreign nations, is that really necessary anymore? Is there a need for NATO now that the USSR is gone? 

Some sort of defence union is probably mandatory, as Russia seem more than willing to try to boss around the ~~Baltic countries~~ former Soviet block. Being part of EU and NATO have made a major difference for the countries that Rumsfield called ""new Europe"". 

The problem with that term was that it put EU (as led by France and Germany) and NATO (as led by America) at odds. ""New Europe"" could only be succesful if it had the open markets of EU (with Russia being largely off-limits) and the safety of NATO (so not to be bossed around like Ukraine or invaded like Georgia). Losing the support of either would have been a hard blow.

The ""not wanting to fight America's wars"" is the main reason why Sweden and Finland aren't members of NATO.

Not to be disrespectful, but your country devastated Europe in World War II.  The collapse of the traditional powers and the reaming you gave Eastern Europe contributed greatly to the rise of communism. Europe was rebuilt with large contributions from America.  The satellite wars fought in Vietnam, Korea, and elsewhere were not fought in Europe in large part because the U.S. planted its troops in your country and said it would defend it as your own.  Three generations of Germans grew up without fear of invasion, starvation, or lack of Economic opportunity in large part because of the stability the U.S. has enforced. Lets not forget its neo-liberalism which has so vigorously been forced as the status quo by the U.S. and which Germany owes much of its economic success to.

Don't get me wrong, America is by no means perfect.  The U.S. has done a lot of messed up things and has gone astray this past decade, but this is about more than the now.  This is about history and posterity.  Germany has had much benefit from its relationship with the U.S. It will also, in my opinion, benefit both countries into the future by remaining close allies. 

You may think Russia is not a threat, but they still have enough nuclear weapons to wipe out the world.  They are still militarily powerful enough that, if they were inclined to and the US was inclined to allow them, fight virtually any country outside of the U.S. and China and win. Does Germany clash with Russia? Sometimes, although rarely directly.  What about the EU? I think it is more than a little idealistic to think war and conflict remains in the past.

&gt;Same here, not sure why that is either.

I think that the official justification was to prevent each government from firing the people brought in by the previous one (mainly its voters) and replacing them with *their* voters. The fact that this was considered normal and that it took a law to counter it, is telling. Of course, it didn't stop the hiring waves, only the firing ones. I don't know what's worse, the problem or it's 'solution'.

It would be interesting to find out what the reason is in Germany.

&gt; Well, the way it's perceived here is exactly the opposite. Pasok and ND are coming across as ""reformed"", or at least as if they understood the situation, because they're willing to work together and are even campaigning on what people don't want to hear. Neither Samaras nor Venizelos are any more popular in Brussels or Berlin as they are in Athens. They just seem like the best bet.
Syriza, on the other hand, is seen as a return to old politics -- they make unrealistic promises and refuse to cooperate with political competitors. Similarly, that people vote for them isn't seen as a fresh start, but as rejection of change.

That's very interesting! You'll have to keep in mind that PASOK and ND are still the same people that have been ruling all of these decades. I mean the same physical persons. They have told so many lies, they have been entangled in so many scandals (but have always been getting away scot-free somehow), that they are viewed as completely corrupt and untrustworthy, no matter what they say. Who wants more of the same? I don't mean austerity, I mean more of the same lies and corruption. If they seem willing to cooperate with each other, it's only because they see this as the only way for *their parties* to survive (not Greece). Venizelos himself has publicly stated (after the elections) that PASOK is 'rotten to the core after all these years'. That's the same party that was being presented as the only 'trustworthy' political power in Greece before the elections.

By that token, Tsipras is seen by former voters of PASOK and ND as a breath of fresh air (his age and mellow, calm talk helps). We'll have to see.",0,1337330416,null,0,false,0,c4pgrj3,t3_tqnsp,t1_c4pgrj3,t1_c4p7j0i,null,1428949890,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3
true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"There's much more to it. I'm sure you've noticed that there is a big difference between how Greece is being discussed here compared to the others. Of course some of it is due to Greece needing the biggest chunk, but the main reason are the causes for their issues.  

Ireland had a housing bubble and an over-leveraged banking sector that blew up during the 2008 financial crisis. Before that, they had an exemplary budget policy, with low debt and surpluses, and their economy is strong and structurally healthy. They're in a temporary tight spot, but they do whatever they can to get out of it and it's really just a matter of time.  

Portugal does have structural problems and some that resemble Greece's, but on a much smaller scale. They had overlooked the necessity to increase competitiveness when low wages and an educated work force alone didn't cut it anymore after the Eastern Expansion, and Poland, the Czech Republic and so on were eating their cake. They need to reform, but they're working on it and they'll get there eventually with a little help.

Both needed some bailouts, they've got them, they're working on it, no problem. The notorious anti-EU crowd aside, I hear nobody complaining about those bailouts, and there even is a relatively broad support for giving them a stimulus. 

Italy has been having high debt since forever. They were permitted into the Eurozone because of a clause that said entering with high debt levels was OK if a country was seen as working on reducing them, which they had dine until they took a break from reforms after they had been let in, and, well, they were still on that break when the crisis hit.  
But they're working on it now and are going through structural reforms. They have a very strong industrial base in the North, and there's really no reason why their (Northern) economy wouldn't be just as strong as its Austrian neighbors. Give 'em a bit of time to enact reforms, and if markets stay calm they'll have some *very* impressive growth coming their way.  
If markets act up, however, we have a problem. Italy is the third largest economy in the Eurozone. There is very little room for error here.

Spain had similar surpluses and low debt as Ireland (and we'd be in big trouble if they hadn't had them, or if their banking system had blown up similarly), and a giant housing bubble as well. They were over-reliant on construction, which due to said housing bubble lead to wages increasing above of what their productivity would have normally permitted far too quickly, and they have nothing to replace it with.  
They've started out on very low debt levels, but their deficit is huge, their unemployment is scarily high and causes those deficits, and there are no credible plans that could fix it. Not because they don't try, they do, but because there simply doesn't seem to be an obvious solution.  
They're the forth largest economy in the Eurozone and sustaining them for the long term would be extremely expensive. That's a problem, a big one, but at least they're doing what they can and haven't needed any bailouts (yet). 

On the other end of the spectrum we have the core, among them hawks like the Netherlands, Finland and Austria, and of course Germany. Germany is a special case among them, in several ways. Populist anti-bailout parties haven't made governing difficult like in the Netherlands and Finland, although the sentiment is still there. But the main difference is a result of the Reunification:

Remember what the situation was like back then -- we went from two countries, one with a highly decentralized and extremely efficient free market economy and one with a planned economy that operated on a modus of ""this be our city for [iron works](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenh%C3%BCttenstadt)!"" None the less, the workers in the East were very well trained, and the economy operated in the same sectors -- industrial machines, chemicals, and so on. Predictably, the industry in the East could not compete with that of the West, unemployment went through the roof, and a wave of migration set in as the young and the best trained part of the Eastern work force headed to greener pastures in the West.  
Germany's solution was to drop money on the problem, *huge* amounts of money, but in the early 00's it became all too obvious that this [didn't work](http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,373639,00.html). People referred to Germany when they talked of the ""sick man of Europe"", unemployment was very high, and the overextended social net was dragging the Western economy down. At the time, we had a center-left government of the Social Democrats and the Greens. They created a commission to come up with a solution, and then went through with it a labor market reform, welfare cuts, an overhaul of the unemployment system and an increased retirement age. Those reforms kicked in in 2005, you can very easily spot it when you look at a graph that shows unemployment figures.  
There was another factor, however, and that aggravated the negative effects of wages rising faster than competitiveness in the Eurozone periphery. During the decade before the crisis, unions had a deal with the employer associations -- we accept stagnant real wages to regain competitiveness in return for job security.  
When the reforms kicked in, there suddenly was a hyper-competitive Germany, and shortly after the 2008 financial crisis pulled the rug under the feet of the periphery. Some of the problems were caused by it, some had been set up domestically and were merely triggered, and some had existed all along but now became all too obvious. In the case of Greece, it forced the government to come out and explain that the statistics weren't as accurate as they should have been.

Now, Greece is a very special case. They combine an enormous debt and deficits with too low productivity. They do have qualified workers, but what little economy there is to work with is uncompetitive and tied up in red tape. They didn't have a housing bubble or a similar trigger, they got there over a long time in a slow motion train wreck, and it was allowed to escalate to this point because the fact that it was happening had been veiled by their corrupt bureaucracy -- which is seen as them having undermined the common currency. They lack the governance that is necessary to even begin to clean up this mess, and their electorate is about to vote a party into power that outright states that they don't have to because the Eurozone simply can't afford to let them descend into chaos. That there is some truth to that in case of a country that is responsible for a mere 2% of GDP is a big part of the problem.

This all happened right after tax payers had to bail out banks that had made risky bets for high profits, and they don't distinguish between speculation and supposedly secure government bonds that hardly beat inflation -- Greek bonds yielded only very little more than German ones when banks bought them.  
People aren't good at putting themselves in other people's shoes, their perception is selective, and they like to put blame on others. Greeks see what they had to endure and compare their situation to how things were before the crisis. People in the core focus on what hasn't been done, and it's difficult to explain to them why they have to pay while some rich Greeks don't. In the case of Germany, that we had to go through unpopular reforms that Greeks reject fuels self-righteousness, and people pay way more attention to burning German flags and Nazi cartoons than to people cueing up in breadlines.

There's another important difference between the Eurozone and transfers within Germany or the US, apart from the unemployed being more easily able to move to a different state though the lack of language barrier:

Those are federations. States do have sovereignty in many areas, such as education or the police force. They can set their own taxes, in the US and to a lesser degree in Germany, but by far the biggest chunk gets collected and is spent federally. In the US, the federation simply ties spending on infrastructure maintenance to policies in areas that states in theory would be fully sovereign in. This restricts a state's ability to get itself into trouble, and the others have a lot of power through federal budget allocations, both in the US and in Germany, and welfare spending is set centrally.  

We *should* have this in the Eurozone and indeed the EU, IMHO, but we don't. The core doesn't like transfers, and the periphery doesn't want to give up full budget sovereignty. Every transfer of sovereignty has to be agreed to in each individual nation state.",0,1337330462,null,0,false,0,c4pgrnd,t3_ts1tw,t1_c4pgrnd,t1_c4pf2f8,null,1428949894,1773,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1773

true,Impedence,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I think part of the problem is that there is a disagreement about what NATO is for. The [north atlantic treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Treaty) was a mutual defence agreement, as enshrined in article five. However, since then it has grown extensively.

NATO does more than this. It is a command structure for fighting a war as an alliance, but in preparation for this, there is joint training, and [standardisation of equipment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STANAG). The US bases in europe are a manifestation of NATO (part of cooperation, and back-up the credibility of article 5). I absolutely agree that the US should scale-down and remove bases in europe it no longer needs (saving themselves a lot of money), now that there is no imminent threat, but this is not the same as disbanding NATO.

The US does pay a large amount of NATO's budget, just under [23%](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_67655.htm) of the $2.8 billion. The US needs to decide if the benefits of NATO outweigh this cost. There are benefits in terms of political influence (and arms sales) which members of the US armed services may not factor in to their opinions. The expansion of NATO in europe was not done to improve the USA's military capability (look up the armed forces of Albania and Croatia), but to advance political goals. the generals may not like it, but many politicians do.

I would argue that Afghanistan is a poor example. The USA's invocation of article 5 against an ill-defined non-state enemy is hard for European governments to sell at home when it involves the deaths of their servicemen. This is part of the cause of the [extensive caveats](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/12/are_all_nato_soldiers_created_equal.html). Remember, Afghanistan did not attack the USA, the taliban did not attack the USA, an organisation based in Afghanistan attacked the USA, over 10 years ago. Similarly, with Libya (and Kosovo in the past), this is not a defensive operation. However, in the case of Libya, the US was a major player, but not the totally dominant one, so you can read that another way.

Basically, the questions what is NATO? and what should NATO be? Do not seem to have the same answers to everyone.

true,SPRM,SCOT,German studying in Scotland,"I'm glad someone else seems to have the same opinion as I have. I am actually writing my Bachelor thesis at the moment about the CSDP of the EU and my reasoning as to why the questions I raise and try to answer in the thesis are relevant is that Europe has basically lived under a very cozy umbrella of American/NATO-provided security and defence. Now that the US is 'pivoting' away from Europe, i.e. concentrating on the Pacific and not regarding Europe as its most important allies, it is in Europe's interest to increase its own capabilities in the realm of security and defence and to shift from the framework of the NATO to the CSDP in order to maintain its needs. Territorial defence might not be the most important of those needs, as I also think that territorial war within our borders is rather unlikely, but that is by far not the only security-related threat a country can face. EU NAVFOR Atalanta is a good example of why the EU needs, in my opinion, considerable capabilities also of military character: as the single biggest market in the world, we depend on open sea lanes and reduced threats through piracy and sea-based terrorism. It is vital that we maintain and develop further the means we can deploy to ensure the safety of trade routes if we are to keep our level of wealth. 

Edit: For those interested, there is always an ongoing debate between 'atlanticists' and people in favour of independence about whether European security and defence should be handled in the framework of the NATO or the EU. The United Kingdom is a prominent proponent of transatlantic cooperation to continue, whereas France, always weary of American influence, as is well known, tends to favour European independence. That's probably one reason why the UK mainly takes part on Operation Ocean Shield (NATO) at the Horn of Africa while France is a major contributor to EU NAVFOR Atalanta.

Also, Europe still spends an incredible amount of money on defence, but, compared to the US, gets much less out of it because European militaries are still, in big parts, trying to provide the whole spectrum of military capabilities. Only few countries really seem to have understood that this is both inefficient and unnecessary. The Netherlands is a positive example, as far as I am informed, as they have decided rather recently to abandon all their tanks and rely on Germany to protect it on land in the unlikely event of territorial invasion. Of course this was an outcome of having to cut the defence budget, but that is the best incentive there is to force European leaders to work together more closely on developing transnational defence capabilities. Holland operates now e.g. the [European Air Transport Command](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Air_Transport_Command). In my opinion, this is the only way to go.

Edit: By the way, if anyone is interested, the European Union is also surprisingly transparent when it comes to security and defence.

My point was that if not for EU/Nato their situation would be different. Even while Estonia was in NATO and EU, they still had problems with Russia during the statue-episode in 2007. Without support from EU/NATO, things would probably been even harder (of course, this is all speculation).

And it's not just Belarus and Ukraine. In the late 90s Russia was everywhere in the Balkans, claiming common heritage and interests, pushing for regional superpower-status. I'm sure you remember this if you followed news back on the day :)

Personally I think the main reason why EU expanded so hastily toward east even though the countries weren't ready for membership was to get Russia to back off. The only country there today who isn't an EU member, candidate or wannabe is Serbia, and from them brief googling granted me pages like [this](http://english.pravda.ru/russia/economics/05-04-2011/117464-russia_serbia-0/), [this](http://www.europeanforum.net/news/752/russian_president_pays_historic_visit_to_serbia) and [this](http://rt.com/politics/roar-russia-strengthen-presence/).

&gt;And I frankly don't see Russia trying to pull the military card on the EU anytime soon.

You don't have to start an invasion to prove that you're ready to do business. You can also move forces nearer the border of the country you want influence over, open new bases near the border (claiming ""tactical reasons""), do ""accidental"" flyovers over the neighbouring country and check how fast the airforce of the other country answers, do army rehearsals near the border etc. They all increase pressure. (Russia does all of these with Finland.)

Russia has also officially said that it protects all Russians everywhere, even if said Russians don't have citizenship of Russia. Has led to fun situations  with Finland and our small Russian minority (with Russian officials coming here to instruct in how to run things etc.), can't even imagine how things are in the former Soviet block where the Russians are the majority in some provinces.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Not to be disrespectful, but your country devastated Europe in World War II. The collapse of the traditional powers and the reaming you gave Eastern Europe contributed greatly to the rise of communism. 

Well, if we're going to start playing the GUILT GAME, then I suppose it's fair to start talking about all the dictatorships the US set up and supported throughout the world over the last 80 years, or the left wing, democratically elected governments that said dicatorships sometimes replaced.  

&gt; Europe was rebuilt with large contributions from America. 

Yes, the Mashall Plan. We know. It was in the form of both grants and loans, much of it was spent on American goods, and obviously the loans had to be paid back. The primary goal of the Marshall plan was to prevent the spread of Communism throughout Europe, but the way many Americans talk about it, you would have thought it was humanitarian aid.

&gt; The satellite wars fought in Vietnam, Korea, and elsewhere were not fought in Europe in large part because the U.S. planted its troops in your country and said it would defend it as your own. 

Which, of course, also removed the option for Western Europe to be neutral in the conflict between the Soviet Union and the US. Placing US nuclear assets on European soil gave you a rapid strike capability without risk of losing any of your own cities, and so made Western Europe a target for Soviet nuclear attack rather than simply convensional invasion. 

&gt; Three generations of Germans grew up without fear of invasion, starvation, or lack of Economic opportunity in large part because of the stability the U.S. has enforced. 

Okay, you weren't doing too badly up to here, but this pure Republican party horseshit. I grew up in West Germany during the cold war, in military quarters. Everyone lived in fear of when ""the bomb dropped"", because there was very little chance of surviving if things kicked off between the US and the USSR. My Dad was in Intelligence, and as I got older we talked a lot about what was going on. Here is what was going on:

In the event of a Soviet invasion the British and Germans, and other NATO forces, were expected to make a ""last stand"" against Soviet forces. No one was under any illusion that this would result in anything other than obliteration for NATO forces in West Germany, but they would hopefully delay the Soviet onslaught enough, and cause enough damage, so that the US reinforcements being rushed over the Atlantic would mostly be doing a mopping up job when they arrived. Collatoral damage (thats ""civilian casualties"" to normal people) were expected to be massive. If it looked like the tide was turning against NATO and the Soviets were going to take take Western Europe, you know what the American plan was? Nuke the whole of Western Europe to prevent its industrial base from falling into Soviet hands. That's right, good old Uncle Sam was planning to kill every last one of us if it looked like we were going to end up as part of the Soviet Union. Peronally, I'd rather be alive in a communist state than dead in a nuclear wasteland.

Far from ""protecting"" us, the US viewed Europe an expendable pawn in it's global struggle with the Soviet Union.   

&gt; Lets not forget its neo-liberalism which has so vigorously been forced as the status quo by the U.S. and which Germany owes much of its economic success to.

I think this is untrue, and so, I think, would the average German. We are debating this in the UK at the moment. Most of Germanys success has been as the result the *rejection* of neo-liberalism, or at least the way it has been implemented in the US. For example, Unions are strong organisations in Germany, and legal requirements for companies to have Union representation on boards, and further requirements for worker consultations for large scale business changes, have prevented the manufacturing offshoring that has occurred both in the United States and the UK. Such legal requirements would be looked upon with horror in the US, and labelled ""socialism"", but they have contributed to higher employment, lower weekly working hours, and a generally higher level of affluence. 

&gt; Don't get me wrong, America is by no means perfect. The U.S. has done a lot of messed up things and has gone astray this past decade, but this is about more than the now. This is about history and posterity. Germany has had much benefit from its relationship with the U.S. It will also, in my opinion, benefit both countries into the future by remaining close allies.

No, what this is about is the United States wanting bases in Europe for the benefit of force projection into the Middle East. Personally, the linked article above is all noise, *no one* in the US government will voluntarily close bases on European soil for the forseeable future. If anything, it will be Europeans asking the US troops to leave that finally closes the bases. 

&gt; You may think Russia is not a threat, but they still have enough nuclear weapons to wipe out the world. 

So does the United States. Given that logic, we should be as fearful of the US as we are of Russia. 

&gt; They are still militarily powerful enough that, if they were inclined to and the US was inclined to allow them, fight virtually any country outside of the U.S. and China and win.

No, they really couldn't. If they mobilised on Europes eastern borders they would be in for a very nasty shock indeed. A high proportion of the European population has seen compulsory military service, and even if the Russians won, at the very least they would see an insurgency that would make the US experience in Iraq look like a walk in the park. No one has ever managed to conquer the whole of continental Europe. Ever. The most professional armies the world has ever seen have tried, and failed. I see no reason to think that a half-assed bunch of Russian conscripts could manage it, or hold Europe even if they could. And what would be the point of such a war? What would be the goal?

true,Impedence,UKGB,United Kingdom,"""War on European soil"" is not a matter for mutual defence. The Yugoslavian breakup and conflicts were  localised, and not a threat to NATO countries. While interventions might use NATO command structures and resources, they are not part of NATO's purpose.

There are two problems you highlight. The capability to intervene, and the will to intervene. The problem with Bosnia was the will. At the time shortly after the end of the cold war, defence budgets were still relatively substantial (compared to now). Even if Europe spent more on its armed forces, that wouldn't help, as there was conflicting public opinion about military intervention beyond that sanctioned by the UN.v The initial troops were [under the UN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNPROFOR#Personnel) And later NATO forces [came from many different countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFOR#Components)

I also find it misleading to highlight the failures in capability of ""some"" european armed forces. Remember firstly that the US spends over 40% of world defence spending. Many capabilities the US takes for granted (especially in power projection) are rare, or even unique in the world. Secondly, the european members of NATO vary vastly in size and wealth, and therefore also in military technology and military budgets. The top three; France, the UK and Germany are (in small theatres), not too far behind the US in training and equipment, Italy and Spain have fairly respectable armed forces as well, but from there on down capabilities diminish rapidly. Lumping all of them together is misleading.

&gt;I'm sorry that you feel that way about the Balkans, but if NATO had not intervened more people would have died. Europe can not sit back and allow ethnic cleansing to take place anywhere, if there's one lesson this continent should have learned over the past hundred years it's that. Bombing Serbia and preventing it's forces from acting on civilians was a good cause.

But that's the thing, they didn't really prevent ethnic cleansing. Look at the demographic of Kosovo before the war vs. after the war. With the exception of the north part there are virtually no Serbs living there anymore. There are so many displaced people from Kosovo living in any given part of Serbia today you wouldn't believe. What I'm saying is that while the bombing efforts kept Serbia's military pinned down, the KLA was given free reign to burn down villages, kill civilians and make everyone flee from their homes. I'm pretty sure the Serbian military would have done the same things if they'd not been pinned down, but they didn't really prevent ethnic cleansing if they were only stopping one side, did they?

NATO however got a pretty good deal out of it - the largest NATO base in the balkans today is situated in Kosovo, which has a pretty good strategic position, considering it's on a relatively narrow straight between central europe and the middle east.

&gt;Afghanistan suffered from a lack of planning ,vision and goals not so much really an issue with NATO rather than with the people involved in NATO.

The people involved in NATO are NATO. What do you judge an organisation by if not by the nature of it's operations. The bottom line is, an organisation founded on mutual defense was used to attack and invade a country. NATO's european members were naturally less than excited about it.

&gt;Make no mistake, Russia is not Europe's friend we cannot afford to appear weak to a nation that is fuelling our economy's and has no issue in turning off the taps to exert influence. The missile shield is ridiculous though, but again I don't think this is primary a NATO concern.

Oh i never thought Russia is Europe's friend, but they're fuelling the economy throught business deals, which should be negotiated by those means. Every country will and does exert influence through business, why is Russia special in this regard? What i'm trying to say is, NATO is setting itself in a position where they are threatening Russia in a military sense, and Russia is naturally not pleased. Is it justified to get better deals on the price of gas by threatening with guns? If Russia were threatening Europe by military means, i could understand surrounding it with military bases, but I haven't seen any of that yet, just taking the cold war rethoric out of the closet, dusting it off and using it once again.

We could have done better no doubt, but was this NATO's fault? I don't think that the mistakes that happened in both Kosovo and Bosnia and the entire way the breakup of Yugoslavia would have been handled better with some over arching UN force.

I agree with you here, NATO's mandate shouldn't allow it to take these actions, but the UN is teethless so what can you do. There needs to be a separation between the alliance that ensures a mutual defence treaty and whatever treaty they want to draw up that has the teeth to stop ethnic cleansing happening in Europe again. They need to be two distinct groups with very different mandates.

Russia is threatening Europe though, but via economic means. Europe has no other response but to buckle up and show that it can't be pushed around economically with the only playable card it has. Concessions will be made re: military bases in exchange for Russian concessions on how much fuel it allows to be pumped into Europe. It's not too dissimilar from how the cold war was, but we don't live under the threat of nuclear weapons hanging over Europe's head any longer. Russia is still a hostile place to do business and a belligerent partner in negotiations.

Anyway I think we're slightly drifting of point here, my basic premise is that.

1. NATO needs to just be about defence. No pre-emptive actions.
2. The UN needs teeth to prevent things like what was happening during the breakup of FRY
3. That force needs to be truly international
4. We need to be willing to use it (big one, especially with the amount of nations being involved)

I don't know if this is possible with the way the UN is set up though, the security council veto's alone make it improbable.

Estonia is in both EU and NATO and they had that statue-episode.
Finland is in EU and we have to suffer repeated ""accidental"" flyovers (and all the rest I listed above). 

I agree with you on the integration issue on a whole, but excluding Finland and Sweden, pretty much all the EU countries are in NATO and supposedly integrate through that (that's also the main expressed reason why we should be in NATO as well - it's a topic that's always on the table in Finnish politics). It's true that EU Battlegroup isn't exactly a formidable force.

How?

&gt;  Europe was rebuilt with large contributions from America.

These 'contributions' weren't 'large', in fact their effects on the whole *wirtschaftwunder* were quite insignificant. 

Furthermore, it's not like the US gave European nations money they could spend where they wanted(Asia). These 'funds' could only be used to buy American products. The Netherlands, being one of the countries that benefited the most from the Marshall Plan(still less than 8% of yearly growth -1965 can be attributed to the plan), used most of the 'aid' to buy weapons from the US. When they subsequentially used those arms to restore order in the Dutch East-Indies the US got nervous and started supporting the Republik Indonesia(they wanted an easily manipulable country, oil and other resources). 

&gt; The satellite wars fought in Vietnam, Korea, and elsewhere were not fought in Europe in large part because the U.S. planted its troops in your country and said it would defend it as your own.

These wars were fought there because the US had interests there. They even fabricated the ""Domino-theory"" to fool their electorate. 

European nations weren't so sure that the US would ""defend it as your own"" and we can't be sure now either.

&gt; Three generations of Germans grew up without fear of invasion, starvation, or lack of Economic opportunity in large part because of the stability the U.S. has enforced.

There was a lot of fear and part of that fear was a direct consequence of the tensions that the US created. Remember that the SU wasn't as big a threat as the US thought they were. 

&gt; neo-liberalism which Germany owes much of its economic success to

What? I assume you mean economic neo-liberalism? This has benefitted everyone and existed before WW2 aswell. The US isn't pro-free markets for humanitarian reason btw.

&gt; fight virtually any country outside of the U.S. and China and win.

I disagree, though your definition of winning may depend on the war-aims.

As to the old saw that Europe isn't pulling it's defense weight, I, for one, am glad Europe isn't a heavily armed camp again and would like it to stay that way. NATO is a defensive alliance, first and foremost, let it continue to be one. 
Also, I would like it if we were to bring our troops home from Europe for good and not have to spend all of the time of people and resources on something that we should have ended twenty years ago.

Because while Germany was struggling, from 2002 to 2005, the ECB reduced Euro interest rates ([275 basis points from peak to trough](http://www.ecb.int/stats/monetary/rates/html/index.en.html)), pouring capital into European banks and providing monetary stimulus to the German economy. But at the same time [the Spanish and Irish economies were still growing strongly](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ngdp_rpch&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:DE:ES:IE&amp;ifdim=world&amp;tstart=832374000000&amp;tend=1305673200000&amp;ind=false). The reduced rates led to huge transfers from banks in the core countries to invest in housing in Ireland and Spain, driving [high current account deficits, and the continuation of an unprecedented boom in construction](http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/7876). And it was the bursting of the bubble associated with this boom that led to massive government deficits, tenuous balance sheets throughout the European banking sector, and the need for the Spanish and Irish bailouts. 

Then, once the situation had reversed, and Germany grows while Ireland and Spain stagnate, the ECB has apparently refrained from doing as much as it could to help. Notably, they are still hawkish on inflation, even when some inflation would arguably help periphery countries become more competitive. So, the charge is that the central Eurozone authorities have exacerbated rather than smoothed the crisis, by acting on behalf of the interests of the core over the periphery, and therefore the core countries bear some degree of responsibility for the consequences of these actions.

Yes, and my original version of that point said that (before I hastily edited it), but that is the running things side. Operations are not included in that, and the US pays a lot more proportionally for those (in money and lives). Personally, I think that there are no other ways the USA could spend under a billion dollars, in a way to bring in more security and political benefits. Besides, I'm pretty sure that the USA's equipment and weapons sales (and maintainance contracts) they are able to make to Europe (because of the need for compatibility between armed forces) help out-weigh this. Where were the tomahawk missiles used by Britain in Libya made, for example

Another point I didn't bring up are that the USA is known to be making extensive use of european special forces from many countries in Afghanistan, whose operations are not well known, but stories occasionally when negative [come out](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,554033,00.html), which I'm pretty sure are the tip of the iceberg, and won't be recognised by the majority of Americans.

I share your frustration, but this really isn't an unhealthy thought pattern considering the kind of grievous confusions people have in other respects, about fascism. It's more correct to say far right ≈ nazis (congruency, not equality.) For example, far too many people believe fascism could never happen again, or that it appeared suddenly, instead of being the gradual process that it was. That I consider more critical than hairsplitting the far right tendencies towards fascism from fascism itself.

I don't mean jingoism or anything like that, but just proud that we have came together like this.

The EU should never be about leaving, it should be about reform, and every member has a good deal of power to bring their ideas to the table. I'm not saying it doesn't have flaws (I would like a single elected president), but I think a lot of these are down to the fact that this has grown out of a trade agreement. 

Things that annoy me about the British Press:

1. They want Greece to leave the Euro and often don't cite the fact that a Greek exit could be catastrophic to the whole european economy.

2. They have no foresight to see that in 10 or 20 years the UK won't be a world power at all, and in fact has more benefits in staying in the EU. The only real argument against the EU is pure nationalism. 

3. They poison the public against the EU without noting that even if we were in the EFTA we would still adhering to EU trade laws without representation.

4. The British centric attitude of even the BBC, who I saw today said 'Should Britain Build a Space Port', only to be clarified in the video as 'Should [Private Company] build a space port'.

I'm not saying we shouldn't be critical of the EU, heck, that's how things are fixed, but the press is critical of the EU and then have no solution to the problem except 'leave'. My auntie the other day said that the way to fix the recession is to 'leave the europe .. ', she didn't even know what the EU was! And why should people think differently, if you've read the telegraph your whole life (a pretty good paper!) and it's now telling you that this evil EU entity is threatening our way of life, then sure, you'll listen to them. 

It's not even as if the press is giving an unbiased view of the EU, often it just throws things way out of proportion (see optional EU flags on sports teams headlining as 'EU FLAGS TO BE PUT ON SPORTS UNIFORMS'), and honestly, I don't think this is 'British' at all. 

The British way to do things (as most eurosceptic nationalists will tell you) is through reason, logic, and levelheadedness approaching the problem and changing it to benefit you.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Here's an economic analysis I've written to accompany the political one:

Within the Eurozone European economies and the ECB are all 100% autonomous organizations. Unlike in say the U.S. where if the state of Mississippi runs a surplus, but Oregon has a deficit, your economic profit is zero instead of negative because some of that budget surplus can be used to cover that budget deficit. However, in Europe Germany technically isn’t responsible for making sure Greece turns out alright just as much as Japan isn’t responsible for the economy of Zimbabwe. To use a clichéd analogy, the chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

This was taken into careful consideration when planning the Euro, and which countries would be admitted to the Euro zone. Thus to protect the stronger European economies from the weaker European economies, a set of  guidelines were set into place to ensure that weak European countries wouldn't drag down the rest of the strong European economies by joining the currency. Not sure what the specific agreements were off the top of my head, but it was something along the lines of low inflation, high savings/investment, and low growth/debt ratio. If you met these conditions, you were officially part of the Euro zone!

Now, notice that last condition I mentioned, low growth/debt ratios. I have pointed out earlier that in order to grow your economy, and especially to grow your economy at a rate that Germany/France would deem you worthy of joining the Euro zone, you have to borrow/spend and borrow/spend a lot.
 In theory this would allow the strong European economies to join together immediately under the currency while the weaker countries would be lined up to join the Eurozone as their economies slowly improved over time. 
However, the incentive for a country such as Greece to join the Eurozone was huge. Being tied to a set of very strong economies like Germany and France would be a huge benefit to the struggling Greece, and even not being included in the Eurozone from the offset would widely be considered an insult to historically very European countries. 



So you may be asking yourself, if low growth/debt ratios were required to enter the Euro zone, and raising your growth/GDP ratio is the only way to enter, that's a catch-22 how were they allowed in? Well I'll tell you, they did it through shady accounting measures. Greece started borrowing money and spending huge amounts via fiscal policy to grow their economy.

Despite their huge debt levels and artificially inflated economies Greece and a bunch of other weak Euro economies find themselves in the Euro zone riding Germany's growth to prosperity, right? Not quite. Because the ECB is autonomous these countries can't use monetary policy to change their money supply. The only way Greece can start paying back its debt is by growing and increasing their marginal tax base. Here’s where the first problem sets in. Normally after fiscal policy is used to reach the full employment output, monetary policy can be used to stabilize prices and allow the economy to continue to produce at that full employment output. Since Greece can’t do that, the only way they can continue to facilitate this growth is by continuing to borrow, this time by using the perceived strength of the Eurozone as a sort of credit rating to borrow lots and lots of money.  

Eventually Greece reaches a point where they can’t borrow any more money without paying back their existing debt, but they can’t grow to pay back their debt without borrowing more. Once the full nature of Greece’s debt/gdp story is revealed, a massive credit freeze hits the weaker countries of the Eurozone. Now Greece is facing huge unemployment, and can’t do anything about it. Can’t use monetary policy to push up aggregate demand, and it can’t use fiscal policy to facilitate growth. Even worse is because Germany is so afraid of inflation, they will under no circumstances allow the ECB to start printing off money. Something Greece desperately needs to boost consumption. This is why some economists are starting to predict the end of the Eurozone. If Greece is able to return to the drachma and establish a central bank, they can lower interest rates to the lower bound rate, and immediately start printing money to fuel growth based fiscal policy.

According to the AD model, when an economy is well below the full employment output monetary and fiscal policy can be used to return the economy to that point. According to neo-keynesian theory specifically when the economy still isn’t at full employment after the central bank reaches the lower bound rate, fiscal policy is then used to boost AD back to full employment output. If fiscal policy overshoots that target (AD&gt;Y), then monetary policy is used to raise interest rates and make minute adjustments in AD. So there we have it, in essence Greece just doesn’t have enough money to both pay back its debt and to consume at level able to grow the economy.

Greece is in trouble due to its overwhelming debt issues.  But why is this crisis happening now versus in the year 2000?  Because Greece was in the Euro, and they could sell debt at Euro rates, rather than at Greece rates.  However, they can't devalue their currency, and Germany insists on hawkish monetary policy to reduce inflation.  The rest of the continent needs loose monetary policy and Germany insists on tight monetary policy.  When you say that Greece ""lacks the governance to clean up this mess"" it's true, but they also lack the ability to clean up the mess.

We can see this much more clearly when we look at Spain.  Spain didn't have a governance problem.  They were running a primary budget surplus before the crash.  They have a problem with Germans buying up the cost of housing in the country and pushing up wages.  And now they have a problem with monetary policy being incredibly tight and Frankfurt insisting on austerity measures that are crippling their economy.

Spain doesn't need a regressive transfer system and a loss of sovereignty, they need looser monetary policy and aggressive fiscal stimulus (which they could pay for if Greece hadn't tanked their credit by proxy).

Similarly, Italy doesn't have as big a governance problem as Greece.  They have a monetary policy problem.  

You can simplify matters by saying that the biggest problem in the EuroZone is the prioritization of Germany's monetary needs over the rest of the area.

Edit:  also, a large part of Germany's success is that the Euro being ""dragged down"" by the periphery has prevented the currency from appreciating where it normally would, allowing Germany to continue being powered by exports.  Finally, the reason why Frankfurt is considering more bailouts of Greece is that it's cheaper to bail them out than all the German banks who misbehaved.",0,1337352753,null,0,false,0,c4pj507,t3_ts1tw,t1_c4pj507,t1_c4pgrnd,null,1428951012,36,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,36

true,BakersDozen,null,null,"&gt; Ireland had a housing bubble and an over-leveraged banking sector that blew up during the 2008 financial crisis. Before that, they had an exemplary budget policy

That's partly what's so vacuous about all of this.  For much of the so-called ""celtic tiger"" era, Ireland's economy was indeed held up as an example, even though it was utterly unsustainable.  As the housing bubble inflated, so the government dropped income taxes and moved to more transaction taxes.  The money flowed into its coffers, and the government was able to buy industrial harmony through sharing the largesse with the unions.  The public sector swelled and successive ministers bragged about how much they were pumping into it, rather than about the value they were getting for every euro spent.  When the bubble burst, the income stream went with it, and Ireland was left with a bloated administrative structure which it could neither afford nor touch, thanks to the union agreements hammered out in good times.  An unmanageable deficit for the medium term was thus ensured.

The banking sector was indeed highly leveraged thanks to a steady incoming stream of bond money.  When the bubble collapsed, the banks ended up with their loans failing, and the security of unfinished housing developments proving next to worthless.  Bond holders had no realistic hope of getting their money back, a situation which the EU was not prepared to countenance.  Under pressure, an ill-advised government made a rushed decision, literally getting ministers out of bed one hurried night to approve a government guarantee of all of that debt.  These socialised investment losses added to Ireland's already embarrassingly large government debt, and Ireland ended up getting EU/IMF money to pay back unsecured foreign bondholders.

I currently work in the UK. I want to be with my family and friends in Spain, but there is no work. It seems to me, Spain needs to re-structure it's tax system. The big companies like Telefonica and Mercadona have a lot of policitcal sway. The current tax structure is attractive to them. The litle guys though, have no protection, pay too much tax and social security and get very little in return for superannuation or other support services. And yet, the little guys contribute significantly to the economy. I do wonder if the government made it cheaper to participate - i.e. more support but pay less tax - how many more illegal companies would suddenly become legal. 

I also wonder about the amount of fraud there is in the system. It seems to be a lot, but I don't have any data for comparison/insight. Weekly you read about a politician or someone in a local council who took bribes. This has to be hurting the ability of Spain to recover - millions of euros going missing or miss-spent.

And finally, there isn't any real support I can see to help people change careers out of constuction into something else.

true,mambrino,ESPA,Spain,"I can answer in the case of Spain.

Here the mindset has always been pro buying instead of pro renting (for decades, housing was a way to keep wealth when the currency -peseta- was being devaluated). You could hear you mom constantly saying ""to rent is to throw money away"" (*alquilar es tirar el dinero*).

Forward to the 2000s: Spain got the euro currency, and lost control of its monetary policy: interest rates of the European Central Bank were lower that previously (with Spain's own Cental Bank), so this gave access to a lot of cheap money to local Banks and companies, and at the end, households, in the form of mortgage and consumer credits.

From the 2000s Spain economy experimented unprecedented growth. The future was bright, and money was cheap, so more and more families decided to bought a house. This made the prices go up, stimulated the house building sector, which in turn attracted investments from banks and required immense workforce. That made the economy look even brighter, and the unemployment shrank. In turn, more people had access to housing, banks were willing to take less precautions when giving out mortgages (as housing prices were rising, it always seemed a good investment), this in turn stimulated demand and even more money was available, etc, you get the idea, the system had feedback so a bubble formed from 2000 to 2007, aprox.

Of course, internationally, Spain seemed an excellent place to invest, and massive quantities of foreign and local money were sucked into the sector.

Spain Central Bank and successive governments did nothing, as things seemed to go beautifully and nobody wanted to be the messenger of bad news.

In 2007-2008 the international crisis cast some doubt in the international credit markets, and this event alone was enough to moderate the rate mortgages were being conceded to households by banks, which in turn moderated demand, then prices increases went flat, the bubble slowly burst.

At first, until about 2010, there were a lot of naysayers, but today in 2012 everybody openly assumes the housing market is in free fall, and even the government is eager to burst the bubble even more and make the banks come clean of it, to regain international credibility.

The big problem is that this housing bubble supported many things: GDP growth, very low unemployment, and a huge slice of banks' investments.

As the bubble popped, a shitstorm unleashed.

Now the house building sector is something laughable, like a tenth of what it was in 2007. All the workforce is now unemployed, most of these families have mortgages and incredible personal dramas (in Spain, you are responsible for your debts, including mortgages, for your whole life).

Unemployment is awful, moderate in the rich regions in the north (esp. Basque Country) but desolate in the south (something like 30-40%)

Add to this that most government money (especially for local governments) came from taxing building construction, etc, and from VAT. Also, government spending has gone thru the roof (unemployment benefits, etc).

So less income + a lot more spending = budget deficit.

Finally, the banking system was heavily invested in the housing sector (credit to construction projects and companies, and mortgages to families). As the credit defaults have risen a lot, and housing prices have crashed, the Banks accounts are extremely damaged.

As banks are really scared if somebody finds out their real situation, they tend to lie, hide losses, and feign that everything is good until, suddenly, they blow up.

The government has had to nationalize more than 10 banks, the last one a very big one (like the 4th or so), Bankia, a couple of weeks ago.

This create quite a social unrest because people have to endure big cuts in education, public health system, etc (about 10.000 M€ the last ""packet"") and, at the same time, saves banks (it's estimated that ""helping"" Bankia will require more than 10.000 M€ of public money).

Edit: also, the shit banks may be hiding casts a lot of doubts internationally, as investors know the government will try to help the crappy banks incurring in more budgetary deficit.

And, well, that's more or less where we stand now.

Fortunately I'm not unemployed, but I'm scared we may be forced to leave the eurozone, and lose my life savings to devaluation or whatever.

Please, the EU has meant a lot to Spain. This country was shitty in the 80s, now you can almost feel you are in Europe when you are here. Don't abandon us!

Edit: spelling, etc.

TL;DR: pro-buying mentality + cheap money = housing bubble. Bubble = low unemployment and bank investments.  Bubble burst, workforce went unemployed, banks went broke.

We have to remember this is more aimed at Greece than us. We are already signed up to the strict rules, this is just restating them and enforcing them. We haven't even broken those rules so the punishments wouldnt apply.

From what Ive read, and anyone that may please correct me if im wrong, is that the argument that it will cause worse austerity is incorrect. the type of budget rules are to address countries like Greece and Italy who ran constant deficits and was allowed to get worse until it became a huge problem. With us that wasn't the case .No punishments apply if it is an extraordinary event that pushes countries into debt (like the 2008 collapse) and it does not stop borrowing for investment purposes or one off projects. Also the rules don't apply when were in a bailout program and for many years after the end of that program. More years than its needed or desirable to sort out the deficit.

I think most people realise that spending more than you have is foolish. Leaving aside the bank bill we still have a massive hole in our public finances (what is it now 12 bn?) and if we need to fill that hole and dont have access to the ESM we will have to do it through cuts and taxation.

true,we_who_love_freedom,null,null,"I have spent a year studying this very issue in my Masters at NUI Galway. Perhaps I could shed some light on the issue as it relates to Ireland.

So you know from looking around EVERYWHERE that a referendum is to take place to ratify the Fiscal Compact, which is happening both because it has already been signed by Enda and because the treaty itself requires internal ratification into Irish law.  The issue is so hot-button that no one wants to take responsibility for it without getting a clear signal from the people about they want.

In brief, the treaty does a few things, which IMHO seem to be logical.  Mainly it aligns the fiscal policy of each ratifying member-state with the overall monetary status of the whole. This is to say that since EU member states have the same currency, ECB-set interest rate, and in most cases, legal protections, that they must also have the same budgetary position with regard to debt levels and deficit/surplus proclivities.  

There has been a very large amount of what I would call 'cross-investing' between financial institutions within the Eurozone.  An example of this would be German banks buying Greek and Irish sovereign bonds; across the EU, banks in many nations have bought the bonds of other EU states, particularly the Count's 'core' nations buying 'periphery' nation bonds.  The effect of this investment is to tie the EU together financially beyond a currency: should a nation like Greece default on its financial obligations, it could potentially trigger a cascade failure across the EU as the banks holding those bonds may potentially sustain such losses that they default themselves, causing the national economies in which they are located to default. This is why people from the troika have cautioned that losing one state could spell the end of the Euro itself. Interestingly, the Count would be the second German I have heard talk about the relatively tiny fraction that Greece makes up in the EU with regard to GDP, yet has not discussed the extent to which German banks have invested in unstable Greek bonds. I would be very happy to hear, for my own benefit, the extent to which a Greek failure would impact German banks.  Losing Greece might not have any real impact on gross output, but I am sure it would have a huge impact on many domestic economies as banks holding Greek bonds suffer losses. 

That said, the way the Treaty works is actually simple.  First, it mandates that all signatories maintain a debt level of 60% relative to GDP.  Any nation that exceeds this mark triggers an automatic mechanism in Article 3 that mandates them to reduce their debt level by 1/20th per year until it returns to the 60% debt to GDP level.  In Ireland's case, with a debt to GDP figure expected to peak at somewhere around 120% by next year, it would mean that Ireland would have to reduce its debt level by 3% per year over the next 20 years or face an internal sanction.  

Beyond this, the treaty orders that each signatory maintain a budget position that allows at most, a .5% structural deficit in nations who have a debt level lower than 60% and 1% structural deficit in nations who exceed the 60% mark, as they are considered 'special cases'.  A structural deficit differs from an actual deficit in that it is adjusted for position in the economic cycle.  In other words, the allowable amount of deficit is determined by whether the economy is in growth or recession phase; the amount of budget deficit is higher during a recession economy than in a growth economy so that nations can use proper counter-cyclical planning to cool off a growing economy and encourage growth in a contracting one.  What is the most important fact to note is that the wholesale overspending and large budget deficits some EU nations have maintained over the years will no longer be allowable.

With regard to Ireland, most of what is being said in the media, across the board, by Labour, Fine Gael, Enda, Noonan, Sinn Fein, and the TDs has little if anything to do with what the real issue is.  So, I will try to lay it out as succinctly as I can:

When the housing bubble and over-leveraging of all 6 banking institutions in Ireland threatened total economic collapse, Ireland took a very large bailout from the IMF/EU; I know you know this, but bear with me, I am only setting the stage.  The money was used to recapitalise the banks, which were re-organised, and to give the government money to continue funding itself until 2015.  It came with the mandate that the State reduce its deficit levels incrementally each year.  In 2011, Ireland had a 10% budget deficit. In 2012, it must reduce this to 8.6.%. Next year, that level should be 7.5%, in 2014 5%, and in 2015, 2.9%.  The government expects to meet these targets through a combination of economic growth and reduced spending, but IMHO it is unlikely they will meet this.  In many regards, they are working at cross-purposes.  It is very difficult to nurture growth while reducing spending; one is taking money out of the economy and asking it to grow. 

The elephant in the room which is being ignored in the media is debt. As I said before, Ireland has nearly twice the amount of debt, largely due to the bailout, that the Treaty allows.  Servicing this debt is requiring something like 25% of tax revenue (non-voted expenditure in the budget) to pay JUST the interest payment.  Add to this a large budget deficit that has been sustained since 2001, when Bertie's government moved from counter-cyclical policy toward pro-cyclical policy and added more fuel to the fire of an already out of control economy.  Overall, this debt level places the Irish economy in a very fragile state; the amount of money being required to be spent on loan repayment is forcing Ireland close to the margins for default--should it not meet the growth targets, or be unable to meet the budget positions, it will add more debt to the burden, which has the potential to lock the country into a perpetual debt cycle that becomes progressively harder to break. At some point, if the debt keeps growing, it will either force default through failure to make the loan payment, or by triggering economic collapse by the act of paying it. 

So, with regard to the treaty, all the Treaty will do is to force Ireland to reduce it's debt levels by 3% a year, and maintain less than a 1% structural deficit.  The question is whether this is possible, especially when the growth figures being put out by finance are very likely overly optimistic.  Ireland's open economy is very dependent upon the performance of the economies of its trading partners, which in the case of the UK, it's chief trading partner, is going into recession; there is also trouble generating export-led growth when access to credit remains doubtful and the government is deleveraging the economy.  

What you and the rest of the voters out there need to think about is how committed you are to reducing debt.  Quite frankly, the 'austerity' idea being flogged across the media is ridiculous, in parallel with social unrest across the EU--Hollande's election and Greek parliamentary woes are examples.  What opponents of the treaty are mainly saying is that 'austerity' or the forced reduction of spending is bad and shouldn't happen, and that the people of the State shouldn't bear any burden for the state's troubles.  I say this to you not as a partisan attempt to garner a 'Yes' vote, but to point out how short sighted it is.  If the treaty fails, it will signal a return to the overspending policies of the past, where the State will have to borrow money to fund itself, which will add more debt to a dangerously high amount.  I support growth, creation of jobs, and social safety, but no one has explained how exactly this will happen without a large increase in spending, and even more added debt. My guess is that Sinn Fein et al aren't considering it.  They want relief now, and don't care what the consequences will be in the long term. 

The road ahead is going to be hard. If the government ratifies the Treaty, it will force the state to reduce to a skeleton size, and many people will likely emigrate, as they are now. Social protections like the Live Register and Pensions will dwindle. Croke Park will dissolve, and their will probably be some unrest. The State will simply have to cut to all but essential services until it can get a handle on the debt situation, if it can even cut enough services to make the interest payment and arrive at a budget surplus without triggering collapse.  Sounds dreadful doesn't it? The alternative is not ratify the treaty, and effectively cut Ireland off from further assistance and destroy any confidence in Ireland in the markets; and to resume greater spending in the attempt to grow, which will almost certainly end in default through continually added debt.  What 'austerity' really means is what position Ireland will take in the future.  Hope this helped.

true,refcon,UKGB,United Kingdom,"1. The British Press puts forward multiple views - the Guardian and Independent are Left wing, Times and Telegraph Socially Conservative and Economist Fiscaly conservative and Socially Liberal. You can no more lump the UK press all into 1 than I could say that the whole of the French Press is summed up by Le Monde.

2.Again if you read newspapers like the Guardian and Independent this view is repeatedly put across. Hell editorials in right wing newspapers have made this point. Also whether Europe will be politically integrated enough to be considered a superpower is debatable - look at its failure to gain a democratic mandate on the European constitution. That was by the French and the Dutch, not the dastardly British. 

3.Again people have many different view points. The point on having to follow EFTA rules was made in the Economist - hardly the pro European paper of choice. 

4.There is a reason the British Broadcasting Corporation is British centric. It is because it is the BRITISH Broadcasting corporation. It is also viewed as one of the finest international new organisations in the world, as it is mainly funded by the UK population a focus on the UK is not nationalist, simply a reflection of the population. 

I am not 'anti' the EU, I do not however believe it is run well, it is not run by the most talented people in politics and it has a severe lack of democratic accountability and creditably. There are perfectly logical reasons to oppose further expanding the EU's powers. 

I find it interesting that you harangue those who oppose your view on the EU as they do not know the opposing viewpoint, yet your own comment completely ignores the opposing argument which you implicitly claim you know. 

Rather then your Auntie (who I am sure is a lovely woman) why not pick someone like Peter Osborne or Boris Johnson who are highly educated political writers. Find an article of theirs on the EU and the Greek crisis and repudiate that rather then posting an argument that despite your calls for research has no facts.

And the most costly operations in the last decade have been Afghanistan and Iraq (I know, not NATO, but it's surely in the minds of the ""America pays for the protection of Europe"" crowd), that had very little to do with NATO's original purpose and do very little to protect Europe from the ills of the world. (They likely contributed to it by way of increased immigration)

Now, I don't want it to sound like I'm anti-NATO or anti-US or anything like that, and I don't think we're really arguing here, just discussing the facts. I do in fact believe Europe (meaning mostly the EU) needs to step it up in this area as well as numerous others, and that a NATO with the US and EU as equal contributors is going to be necessary once the center point of world power shifts east. Europe is caught up in internal squabbling and still fails to act singularly in a convincing way, as recently demonstrated in Libya. Nobody shares European values more than the US (and secondary, South America and maybe Africa, but that's a long way in the future), so any drifting apart and weakening of the US and EU will have negative consequences not only for us, but the entire world (the void left behind would quickly be filled by the likes of Russia and China).",0,1337356432,null,0,false,0,c4pjuzb,t3_tsutn,t1_c4pjuzb,t1_c4piq81,null,1428951348,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Proper regulation of interest rates by the ECB could have allowed direct injections of liquidity in the Greek economy to de-leverage its debt to be possible. Instead fears of hyper-inflation may force economic ruin, which I think is ironic. 

Also people should remember that the US is a domestic economy. 80% of what it produces it consumes, which is the opposite of most of Europe, barring Germany.  When talking about Keynesian economic models (which are horrible btw) the approach taken to using interest rates as inflation targets differs in domestic vs open economies because the keys to growth are located within the state.  This is to say that lowering interest rates to encourage consumption has less impact in an open economy because most of the products consumers are purchasing are imports; lowering interest rates in a domestic economy works better because consumers are buying domestically produced products, and most of the borrowing is being done by domestic firms who will sell domestically.  For Greece, Ireland, and other open economies to grow like they need to, money must be spent to nurture production, not consumption, in a slow change toward a domestic economy from an open economy.  If Irish firms can start producing products that Irish consumers buy, then the economy it creates is self-sustaining.  This is exactly what Greece needs.

I would also try to remember that Ireland's issues aren't isolated.  Across the board, debt is a gigantic problem. So much so that I would say debt is to the first world like famine and disease are to the third world. Everybody is having to reconsider their choices.  It's not just Ireland. And remember that we are tough people. Ireland has had worse and survived. We'll get through this one too.  What we have to absolutely do is be honest about it. What shocks me is the lack of reality I am hearing in the media about what is going on.  Either they don't get it, or they are covering it up, both of which are unacceptable in my opinion.  

BTW I think that we are caught up in a much larger current.  I just returned from Hong Kong where I was working with Enterprise Ireland to facilitate trade.  It was great to see one of the world's most free-market economies function, and to see how much prosperity there is there.  It was interesting to hear HK business leaders talk about how they view the welfare states of Europe as failures because the very government they allow to intervene in the economy on their behalf, to provide services that create 'equality', actually destroys the means of production through excessive taxation and regulation.  It might not be a bad thing for this particular model of governance to fail, if it means a change toward something more free market that will enable the building of wealth.  It's just that across Europe these more 'socialist' backlashes seem to indicate that people are determined to take things further than they already have.  So I wouldn't worry too much about Ireland specifically. Forces in France, Greece, and lately in Germany, may make the decision for us.  We ought to just head down to the pub, have a pint, and wait it out. It'll be grand so.

Of note, the current arrangement of sovereignty in the US and the economic coordination that falls out of it is not how the US has always been.  A great deal of evolution happened in the 19th century that produced the power dynamic that underlies US economics and makes it very different from EU economics.  The central event of that century, from the US point of view, was the American Civil War.  The great historian Shelby Foote noted that the Civil War had such an impact on power dynamics in the US that it changed the language.  Prior to the Civil War, the country was referred to in the plural.  ""These United States are...""  Afterward, grammar changes to the singular.  ""The United States is...""

&gt;I would be very happy to hear, for my own benefit, the extent to which a Greek failure would impact German banks. 

The answer is right now, not much impact on German banks. The markets have seen the Greek 'problem' coming for a long time, and the banks have already taken a haircut on Greek bonds. This means that they have internally written the value of these debts down to almost nothing, and already accepted the loss. If they do recover anything, it will be seen as an unexpected windfall.

We may see some wailing and screaming, but it will be play acting. The losses have already been booked, and any further government/EU money spent would end up on the banks' balance sheets as pure profit.

true,BakersDozen,null,null,"&gt; What opponents of the treaty are mainly saying is that 'austerity' or the forced reduction of spending is bad and shouldn't happen, and that the people of the State shouldn't bear any burden for the state's troubles. 

What I've heard them say is that the forced reduction of spending is pointless in isolation.  It further starves an economy where 400,000 people are already unemployed.  By taking money out of people's pockets, it further stifles growth.  Stifling growth leads to a falling GDP, so that the same Euro value of debt ends up representing a higher debt to GDP ratio, the polar opposite of where we are trying to go.

&gt; If the treaty fails, it will signal a return to the overspending policies of the past, where the State will have to borrow money to fund itself, which will add more debt to a dangerously high amount.

The State will have to borrow more anyway.  That's certain.  

&gt; I support growth, creation of jobs, and social safety, but no one has explained how exactly this will happen without a large increase in spending

Which is a failure of the political system and the architects of this treaty.  If I remember correctly, it refers to growth just once in the preamble, and never comes back to the topic.  No wonder M Hollande wants to revisit it.

&gt; If the government ratifies the Treaty, it will force the state to reduce to a skeleton size, and many people will likely emigrate, as they are now. Social protections like the Live Register and Pensions will dwindle. Croke Park will dissolve, and their will probably be some unrest. The State will simply have to cut to all but essential services until it can get a handle on the debt situation, if it can even cut enough services to make the interest payment and arrive at a budget surplus without triggering collapse. Sounds dreadful doesn't it? 

It does.  It shifts the burden mostly onto those in receipt of welfare - those who can least afford it.  You don't even hint at higher taxes for the wealthy.  It also assumes that somehow, our economy will grow all by itself in the middle of all of this.  All of those unemployed, all of those who emigrate, all of those who drop below the poverty line - are they going to grow the economy?

&gt; The alternative is not ratify the treaty,

not ratify it now, while the government tells us it doesn't need the funding.  Not ratify it now while its contents are potentially going to be changed.  Not ratify it now while there is no evidence of a balancing growth strategy and no equally enforced commitments to invest in growth.

&gt; I say this to you not as a partisan attempt to garner a 'Yes' vote

Funny.  That's exactly how it reads.

But, to be fair, you do provide a lot of info, so thanks for that.  It's a pity that you were unable to more clearly separate the fact from the opinion and conjecture.

Irish banks turned to buying bonds as well as to excessive lending in a search for yield.  Because the housing market was booming, and houses and land are fixed assets, they were deemed safe investments even if their recipients weren't.  It was assumed that houses placed in receivership could be sold off for a profit if mortgage holders couldn't pay. Second, the problem goes all the way up the chain. The ECB, the Irish Central Bank, and the Irish Government all contributed to failure. The ECB because it was using 'inflation targeting' as it's chief means of measuring economic health, the Central Bank because it failed to ask any of the 6 Irish commercial banks where the money they were requesting to borrow would go, and the Government for adopting pro-cyclical fiscal policy.  Third, the decision to seek the bailout wasn't rushed or over night. It took most of a year, with varying members in various administrations sometimes saying everything was fine,  It was only when the NPRF had been raided and so much stake in the banks had been bought by the State that the government began to suspect it couldn't handle things alone. Fourth, the guaranteeing of the debt, which happened twice prior to NAMA was an attempt to stop a run on the banks and before the full extent of the catastrophe was known. Look at what would have happened if they hadn't: total economic collapse.  All 6 banks would have failed much faster as depositors, bondholders, and stakeholders all tried to withdraw their assets.  At least the guaranteed debt bought enough time through confidence for the government to seek help. Fifth, the bailout was to recapitalise banks, not to pay back bondholders.  When the bubble burst, the banks were left holding the bag on a whole host of bad debts on loans they had granted but had defaulted. The only way bonds really have to do with this is in the commercial paper that the banks had written, and to the fact that Irish bonds became worthless in the market and subordinate bondholders had to take a haircut in order to not lose anything. The worthlessness of Irish bonds is the reason that Ireland had to leave the market. 

Had the treaty been ratified, the budgetary position Ireland took under Bertie's administration after 2001 would have caused a problem. Large budget deficits are forbidden in excess of .5% structurally, and Ireland was above this for a decade.

""What opponents of the treaty are mainly saying is that 'austerity' or the forced reduction of spending is bad and shouldn't happen, and that the people of the State shouldn't bear any burden for the state's troubles.""

Utter nonsense, what the people on the no side are saying is much more nuanced than that. The fiscal treaty is a basket case, one who's policies were already ignored by Germany when the last set of deficit rules were introduced under the ""stability and growth pact"" 15 years ago http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16290598 the argument against the treaty is many fold

1. First it represents a chance for the people of Ireland to vote against the idiotic bailing out of the banks. In the last election in 2011 both parties now in government ran on a strongly anti-bailout campaign, and since getting into office have proceeded to continue enacting the policies of the previous government. Fianna Fáil, one of the most successful parties of the post war democratic era suffered the biggest of it's history for enacting those policies. The fiscal compact vote gives the Irish people a chance to vote against the greatest outrage in history of the state (they won't though, by the looks of it now)

2. There is a growing demand in Europe for a turn away from austerity and more towards some form of growth, as represented by the delay in Germany to ratify the treaty (something German chancellor Angela Merkel wanted to get out of the way ASAP to put pressure on Ireland but now due to political pressure has not been able to), and the election of Francoise Hollande in France. Ireland's vote could add to that pressure, setting the agenda rather than following it slavishly (for once).

3. Ireland's debt levels are unsustainable, with a debt to GNP ratio of 140% (not to mention the second highest levels of per capita external debt in the world http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_external_debt ), and an increasing chunk of our finances being needed to serve this level of debt. There's no sense in agreeing to further concessions unless something is done to reduce this burden. 

4. The treaty in inserting a structural balance requirement is effectively outlawing the dominant post-war/depression school of economics known as Keynesianism, it prevents countries running counter-cyclical policy (ie. save when things are good spend when things are bad).

5. The ESM is an unaccountable (who's employees are literally beyond the law http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CZr17HLH5U ) undemocratic institution, it is a wet dream for the likes of Goldman Sachs.

6. There is a clause in the treaty which the Irish government agreed to which (might, there is some disagreement on this) mean that if Ireland doesn't ratify the treaty we'll be cut off from funding for a second bailout (which ironically the government is denying will ever happen). This clause was agreed to in March some three months after the treaty was signed by our own government.

""Ireland had a housing bubble and an over-leveraged banking sector that blew up during the 2008 financial crisis. Before that, they had an exemplary budget policy, with low debt and surpluses, and their economy is strong and structurally healthy. They're in a temporary tight spot, but they do whatever they can to get out of it and it's really just a matter of time.""

...you couldn't be more wrong.

""they had an exemplary budget policy, with low debt and surpluses""

We had a budgetary policy which inflated the housing bubble, including tax breaks for building rental properties, and insufficient investment in health and education. We had a chance to develop an economy that wasn't utterly reliant on foreign investment, by investing and encouraging native industry, instead we pulled the plug on companies like Súcra (Ireland's home based sugar producing company) because they weren't making enough money. 

""their economy is strong and structurally healthy""

Anything but, we've lost 140,000 jobs in construction alone (out of a working population of just over a million). Those were decent paying low skill jobs that will never be replaced. A lot of our foreign investment is of questionable worth. The pharmaceutical industry which was behind a great deal of Ireland's recent (and widely celebrated as proof that austerity is working) meagre GDP growth levels has the highest levels of RPE (revenue per employee) of any industry, anything ranging from €200,000 - €2,000,000 per anum per employee, this means less jobs for your bucks. These companies aren't supplied by Irish companies except when it comes to service industries like construction, legal, health, insurance and banking, industries government after government have bent over backwards to save and support. Hardly any of the raw materials for the foreign owned high-tech sector in Ireland is supplied from within Ireland, these countries are for the most part shells, who use Ireland as a means to avoid paying tax in their home country (more often than not America). We Irish don't make anything ourselves.

""They're in a temporary tight spot,""

There's nothing temporary about 140% debt to GNP, especially if you've no investment towards growth, which is what the new fiscal compact treaty is effectively outlawing, plus a decimated private sector and are actively cutting back on public spending.

""but they do whatever they can to get out of it""

Meaning our government does whatever it's told, ie. whatever is in the interest of the big nations like Germany rather than our own, for example having to borrow €90 billion over the next twenty years to pay off a €26 billion hole in the books of a bank (Anglo Irish) who only dealt with customers in the construction industry and didn't even operate a single ATM machine in the whole country. We have the second highest level of total external debt IN THE WORLD http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_external_debt (albeit inflated by foreign owned banks based here) one does not simply ""get out"" of over half a million dollars in debt per capita.

Companies continuously run with huge levels of debt. My fathers company for example has loans out that are worth about half of what the company is worth, however the loans are spent on investments, which increase revenues and the value of the company.

Why can't a country do the same, and borrow in order to invest (rather than to spend on social services) in infrastructure etc. Surely this would increase GDP, and stimulate growth.

true,we_who_love_freedom,null,null,"I disagree with you most wholeheartedly. Here's why:

&gt; What I've heard them say is that the forced reduction of spending is pointless in isolation. It further starves an economy where 400,000 people are already unemployed. By taking money out of people's pockets, it further stifles growth. Stifling growth leads to a falling GDP, so that the same Euro value of debt ends up representing a higher debt to GDP ratio, the polar opposite of where we are trying to go.

I have already stated that the State is working at cross-purposes in trying to encourage export-led growth at the same time as reducing spending. That it is nearly impossible to achieve growth under de-leveraging conditions. What you don't seem to get is that money doesn't come from nowhere. If the State wants to increase spending and thus encourage growth, it has to be paid for through revenue, which is largely through borrowing. The position that you are taking is that continuing to borrow money, which is increasing the debt burden, which lessens the amount of revenue available to spend from an already low amount, is just fine to continue. It doesn't seem to matter that we already have twice the limit that seems safe, and have been running a budget deficit for nearly a decade, or even that the only way we could continue spending the way we are is through borrowing. We have to stop borrowing, and the 'austere' means of reducing budget deficits s a good thing. You are all about ends, but do not consider the means. 

&gt; It does. It shifts the burden mostly onto those in receipt of welfare - those who can least afford it. You don't even hint at higher taxes for the wealthy. It also assumes that somehow, our economy will grow all by itself in the middle of all of this. All of those unemployed, all of those who emigrate, all of those who drop below the poverty line - are they going to grow the economy?

There is no doubt that we are suffering and that lots of people are without work. The thing is, which I am reading all over the place, is 'demand jobs' as if they appear from nowhere; as if they aren't created by companies with a stable financial sector and access to credit.  I like jobs, and I like growth just as much as you do.  But your method to achieve them is unsustainable, which I said above, but more than that, the reluctance to enter into a common fiscal policy alongside a common currency and interest rate will not only isolate Ireland from the EU, but will destroy any confidence in Ireland in the markets. We'll watch as our sovereign bonds to generate cash for the government stay worthless and places like BOI and AIB can't get any investors.  Good luck asking the troika for more funds when we turned down their idea of accountability. You think things for the people of Ireland are bad now? Just wait until we can't service the loan because we can't outgrow our spending habits and end up leaving the Euro.  How much will our punt be worth do you think? How well do you think we'll attract FDI to create jobs like you want? Have you thought about that?

&gt; not ratify it now, while the government tells us it doesn't need the funding. Not ratify it now while its contents are potentially going to be changed. Not ratify it now while there is no evidence of a balancing growth strategy and no equally enforced commitments to invest in growth.

What exactly is a 'balancing growth strategy'? And why should the EU make a commitment to help Ireland grow when it is thinking of limiting liability? That's what this is about: the capacity for one member state to harm the others. We got ourselves into this mess, and they are assisting us because it is in the interest of the whole to do so, and precisely because our poor practices necessitated the need for some regulation.  Full stop. It isn't the EU's responsibility to help Ireland grow, it's ours, and we absolutely must take some accountability for the state of things. I hate that 400k are on social welfare, and that 50k a year are emigrating.  But unfortunately, the only way out is through. We cannot fix the problem through the exact means that helped cause it. The State must return to the budgetary policy it had prior to 2001, which was exemplary and disciplined.  We cannot keep borrowing. This is a FACT and not conjecture. 

I tried hard to not make this a partisan post.  It truly wasn't intended to persuade anyone to take a position.  It is true that I have analysed this problem and have made my choice for how I think it should be handled.  But the post was an attempt to draw attention to the real problem we face, and that is debt. It isn't jobs, or collective bargaining rights, or sovereignty, or any of the other issues the parties are making this about. The Treaty is about how we will handle our debt burden, and how we will spend money, period. If one wants to fix the economic outlook, we have to first address the debt we carry.  It is the chief concern of everyone with whom we trade. 

To be honest, I almost can't understand the position you're taking here. To use an analogy, it's like you don't care that the train we are on is about to go over a cliff because the view is nice.  I have seen first hand working to facilitate trade for Ireland that the economic systems being proposed in Europe are doomed to fail. The France that Mr. Hollande wants to build, as well as the rest of the welfare sates of Europe are viewed as failed states by more prosperous nations.  To give you an example, in Hong Kong, where the bulk of global trade happens, while I was working with Enterprise Ireland, they recently considered an initiative to enact something like Social Security for all elderly residents. It would have been the equivalent of 300 Euros a month as payment.  But they rejected it, despite pressure from the mainland, because they knew that despite their ability to pay for it now, in 10 years time it would become unsustainable, and more importantly, that nations like France, Ireland, and Germany, who have all done so, now face serious economic peril because of it.  They, being highly prosperous, don't want to start down that road. 

Lastly, you're statement that I simply provided opinion and conjecture instead of fact is ridiculous. Every fact I said in my post is accurate.  Read the Regling and Watson report, or the National Recovery Plan if you want further evidence.  My analysis is based on figures.  I have personally plotted Ireland's debt to GDP projections for the next four years, and even went so far as to do so under more harsh circumstances than the government is predicting. I know exactly what happens to revenue if we don't make either our growth targets or budget restrictions. You're statements sound exactly like the ones I'm reading all over Galway, in the Times, and on the radio by people who know nothing about economics, and you're objections to my post show how little you know about it. 

I'll leave you with an example. Do you understand the relationship between budgetary position, growth, and debt? There's a formula for it. Simplified it's -pD=R-G.  That is the percentage deficit multiplied by a negative must equal the interest rate of debt minus the growth rate in order to maintain debt equilibrium. Lets say Ireland runs an 8.6% deficit as it plans to this year.  Also, it's currently about 6.8% of GDP to service the debt.  So how much do we need to grow under these conditions to not make it worse? Lets see.  Rearranging for G, -G=-R-pD, so G=6.8+8.6, or G=15.4%.  So Ireland, running a budget deficit of 8.6% must grow by 15.4% in order to remain debt neutral. That is to say that if it grows less than 15.4%, then the R value grows because debt grows. If it grows more, than the R value decreases.  Do you see how this could create perpetual debt? Nearly any defict creates a nearly impossible growth target. So my 'conjecture' is based on fact. So you tell me how we plan on growing enough to counter our budget deficit that you will maintain by over-spending, and tell me how it doesn't end in default?",0,1337366791,null,0,1337589393,0,c4pm0k4,t3_ts1tw,t1_c4pm0k4,t1_c4pl036,null,1428952430,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,Throwahoymatie,null,null,"luis1972 is basically right, but I can elaborate if you're interested.

It has to do with how bond markets work, and how democracy generally works.

Democratic governments function by politicians promising the masses goodies.  They can do this by either raising taxes (which hurts real economic productivity, because taxation is a non-voluntary transfer of wealth rather than voluntary trading), or by borrowing money.  Governments borrow as much money as they possibly can by issuing bonds.  Investors buy/sell the bonds, and the demand for the bonds affects their interest rates - as demand for a bond falls, its interest rate rises automatically (in order to attract more buyers).

The European governments are massively in-debt and it's doubtful they'll be able to collect enough tax revenue to pay *the interest* on their bonds.  This causes bond holders to sell, which drives up the interest rates further.  So it's a vicious cycle.

The same thing will eventually happen in the US, and that's why you see US police gradually militarizing and buying crowd-control equipment - they are preparing for the collapse of the dollar.

When Greece finally drops out of the Eurozone (it'll happen), Portugal, Spain, Italy, and others will also consider dropping out, and their bond markets will collapse as well.

The root of all this was having an ""elastic"" money supply, rather than a ""fixed"" money supply based on a commodity like gold/silver:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvL_Dm2d99A

Often you'll hear people mock the gold standard, and its proponents, and claim it causes the economy to stagnate or have a series of ""Panics"".  But this is false, because a neutral observer to the history of gold standards shows that any economic problems occurring during them were the results of other government interference in the market.",0,1337376647,null,0,false,0,c4po1d7,t3_ts1tw,t1_c4po1d7,t1_c4pl002,null,1428953383,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

But you have to keep in mind that governments themselves are *monopoly security corporations* that derive their revenue from *mass extortion* (taxation).

true,BakersDozen,null,null,"You make a fair few references here to my ""position"".  Let me remind you what I have said thus far.  I have countered your somewhat fanciful characterisation of claims made the ""No"" camp with the claims which I have actually heard them make.  I have pointed out that regardless of whether or not we ratify this treaty, we are going to need to secure funds from someplace.  I have pointed out that the treaty makes no provision for growth.  I have pointed out that those hurt by the cuts in welfare are those who can least afford the hurt.  I have pointed out that there is no need to ratify the treaty yet, and some good reasons why we might wait.

That's what I actually said.  You have inferred a position based on the above, but mostly that's your own imagination setting up straw men for you to knock down.

&gt; I have already stated that the State is working at cross-purposes in trying to encourage export-led growth at the same time as reducing spending. That it is nearly impossible to achieve growth under de-leveraging conditions.

We hold much common ground here.  Perhaps we should leave it there?  Oh, go on then.

&gt; If the State wants to increase spending and thus encourage growth, it has to be paid for through revenue, which is largely through borrowing. 

Again, the State will have to borrow from someplace anyway, regardless of the vote.

&gt; It doesn't seem to matter that we already have twice the limit that seems safe,

Our debt to GDP ratio is about twice the arbitrary limit of 60%.  This arbitrary limit (as of 2011 figures) is also broken by the EU average, the Euro average, Germany, Belgium, the UK, France, and a whole host more.  Attacking our GDP is no way to improve this percentage.

&gt;  and have been running a budget deficit for nearly a decade

Actually, we ran a general government surplus for all bar one year in the period 1997 - 2007, and the current deficit run started in 2008.  Not that that's an endorsement of the terrible economic policy of those years, I'm merely pointing out the facts.

&gt; The thing is, which I am reading all over the place, is 'demand jobs' as if they appear from nowhere; as if they aren't created by companies with a stable financial sector and access to credit.

Again you either mischaracterise the diverse cases made by the broad church opposing the immediate ratification of this treaty, or you have access to some strange reading material.  Many of those who realise that the continued growth in unemployment and emigration isn't helping to rebuild the economy are proposing that we invest in projects which create those jobs.  Something which An Taoiseach seems to have [recently cottoned onto](http://www.independent.ie/national-news/taoiseach-draws-up-jobs-list-to-cash-in-on-eu-deal-3106025.html) as he scrabbles to find ways to invest, but something right now which is unachievable under the strictures of the treaty.  You don't create sustainable jobs by ensuring that people have no money to spend on goods and services.

&gt; the reluctance to enter into a common fiscal policy alongside a common currency and interest rate will not only isolate Ireland from the EU

Who will it isolate us from?  France, whose President and Finance Minister have rejected the treaty as it stands?  Germany, where opposition to it is increasing?  The only country, as far as I know, to have deposited its instrument of ratification so far is Greece.

&gt; but will destroy any confidence in Ireland in the markets.

And how will our shrinking GDP, increasing unemployment, and lack of investment in infrastructure give the markets confidence? 

Are you under the impression that the cuts to date have worked?  If you compare the government forecasts from this April to those issued last April, they tell a very different story.  Our projections for Average annual growth rate in GDP, GNP, investment, real wage growth; our projections for nominal GDP in 2015; Job Creation 2011-2015; Unemployment % by 2015; and public debt by 2015; - all of these have worsened in the past 12 months.  And that's just our projections.  Tell me again how this plan is working?

&gt; What exactly is a 'balancing growth strategy'? 

A balancing growth strategy might consist of a programme of investment in key infrastructural areas which would provide much needed jobs in the short tearm, jobs whose wages could be spent on goods and services, and infrastructure which could be used to service business.  It might further consist of targets in these areas to ensure that the funds are invested appropriately.  These could be run in parallel with cuts where money is not being usefully spent.  That is the balance.  

Eurostat figures from 2008 show that Ireland's spend on social protection (22.1% of GDP) was already lower than either the EU-27 average (26.4%) or the EuroArea-16 (27.5%).  I couldn't find any more recent stats, but I doubt the situation has improved for our most vulnerable, and any further cuts unfairly tagret them.

&gt; We got ourselves into this mess

We didn't get into this on our own.  True, we had a housing bubble, but no-one forced international investors to continue pouring their funds into it.  Had the ECB considered raising interest rates when Ireland and other peripheral economies desparately needed that, it would have deflated the boom, but such an accommodation was impossible while Germany's economic cycle needed a low-interest boost.  Had we been allowed to let unsecured bondholders take the loss on their investments, we would have been saved a sizeable portion of our burden, but we weren't.  We didn't get into this all on our own. We were helped and pushed into this hole.  Now that we are in the hole, perhaps we should stop digging.

&gt; It isn't the EU's responsibility to help Ireland grow

This isn't about Ireland.  This is about the European economy.  We all need growth, and we need a combined strategy to encourage it every bit as much as we need a combined strategy to encourage debt reduction.

&gt; I tried hard to not make this a partisan post.

Then perhaps you should have limited yourself to a more neutral presentation rather than referring to one position as being ""short-sighted"".

&gt; The Treaty is about how we will handle our debt burden, and how we will spend money, period.

It was about this.  Then in a late draft they bolted on an unnecessary link between this treaty and the one establishing the ESM.  Thereby allowing the proponents to hang the debate as much as possible on access to additional borrowing, rather than the rest of the treaty which holds to the increasingly clearly erroneous view that you can cut your way out of a recession.

&gt; To give you an example, in Hong Kong, where the bulk of global trade happens, while I was working with Enterprise Ireland, they recently considered an initiative to enact something like Social Security for all elderly residents. It would have been the equivalent of 300 Euros a month as payment. But they rejected it

And you present this as a role model?  A [relatively recent study](http://www.aasw-asia.net/JSSP%2043.pdf)found that:
&gt; the poverty rate for households with at least two elderly persons in the
household (45.1 percent) was higher than for families without (19.7 percent) or
with only one (38.7 percent) elderly person in the household.

Is that the future you offer to us in our old age? 

&gt; Lastly, you're statement that I simply provided opinion and conjecture instead of fact is ridiculous.

That's not what I said.  I said that it was a pity that you didn't separate the fact from the opinion and conjecture.

And as for my speculation on the merits of centralization, it seems to me that the actions of the individual European nations are having tremendous economic impact on the others, and there would be some benefit to centralizing control so that poor decisions in certain countries don't lead to situations like the one Europe is currently in.  

However centralization does have its risks as well, having too much power in one place (or person) can be dangerous.  It seems to me a balance needs to be struck between the two extremes, but the extent of that balance is up to the people who know the situation best in Europe.

There are 'odd' ways in which one or a very few states can affect one or all the others. Sometimes this is a direct affect. California passes legislation that Texans like, and so they agitate for similar legislation.

However, there are indirect means of affecting other states.
Text books for primary education (ages 5 -&gt; 18) is an example. Texas and California are the 2 largest purchasers of text books.  Legislation, preferences, theism and many other factors affect the content of text books.  So... book publishers cater, more like pander, to these 2 state's desires.

Lets take a more concrete example :
evolution - for what ever the fuck reason evolution is 'controversial'.
Texas doesn't like evolution. So text books are modified to reflect this.

Then when Pennsylvania, or Vermont go to buy text books, the contents reflect Texas' choice regarding the teaching of evolution.

true,RabidRaccoon,null,null,"&gt; This is why some economists are starting to predict the end of the Eurozone. If Greece is able to return to the drachma and establish a central bank, they can lower interest rates to the lower bound rate, and immediately start printing money to fuel growth based fiscal policy.

Look at this 

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/market-implies-greek-devaluation-1530-drachma-versus-euro

&gt; On the day when Greek 1Y yields broke above 400% for the first time, a consideration of just what Greece would look like post-exit is perhaps fruitful. Looking at hypothetical forward rates (generated from covered interest rate parity between EURUSD FX and EMU sovereign interest rates), MSCI has an interesting analysis of what a decoupled Drachma (and for that matter Lira, Escudo, and Irish Pound) would look like. Given the Greeks entered the EMU in January 2001 at 340.75 Drachma to the Euro, the current market is pricing in a massive devaluation to around 1530 Drachma to the Euro

So the market is pricing in a ~80% devaluation devaluation if Greece leaves the Euro. That's going to sting isn't it?

I know it's zerohedge and I think they are overly pessimistic most of the time too. But the MSCI analysis they link to seems OK to me. And even a much lower devaluation would be devastating. Not to mention the chaos that would ensue during the switch from € to drachma - everyone would know that their € accounts in Greece would be forcibly converted to drachma. Even if that is done 1:1 everyone knows the drachma will devalue once the markets open. 

This is serious shit by any standard - I can't imagine how bad things would get if they thought they were about to lose up to 80% of their life savings. And the markets clearly believe that Greece is going to print money when if it switched back to the drachma and are therefore pricing in a devaluation. 

I'm not sure if traditional economics is capable of telling the Greek authorities what policies to follow in such an extreme situation. Plus of course it's not like the Greek authorities are exactly planning for it - it would be more like they would only do it under extreme duress having failed to implement austerity and presumably failed to stay in the Euro.",0,1337395839,null,0,1337396232,0,c4pr8en,t3_ts1tw,t1_c4pr8en,t1_c4pj1xe,null,1428954889,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

And inflation targeting is essentially a way of controlling the full employment output (Y). The central bank controls AD, thus they have the power to manipulate the money supply in a way that ultimately determines whether or not the economy is going to be producing at Y. Inflation targeting is just the level at which they're pumping money into the system to either accommodate a growing economy, or to try and boost AD.

 Inflation as a rise in price levels higher than a rise in wages occurs when the inflation rate set by the central bank (i.e. the amount they're raising the money supply by) is greater than the level of peoples/institutions/firms/whatever that need the new money for transactions. In other words when the economy is already producing at its optimal rate pumping money into it doesn't actually do anything other than lower the value of the currency.

true,nestoras,GREE,Greece,"There are many new parties (I think there were a total of 36 parties for these elections), but they all face an uphill, almost impossible battle due to our overcooked (by the two dynasties) electoral law. A party will not enter parliament at all if it takes less than 3% of the vote! That's it. No justification at all. I think this law was enacted many years ago to stop the then newly-formed leftist parties from gaining any traction against the Right. It remained, because it serves a very important function to our 'rulers': a vote for a new, unproven party is considered a 'wasted vote' since in all probability it will not exceed 3% the first time. Hence, most people don't vote for these parties and the prophecy is a self-fulfilling one. They don't get more than 3% and they do not enter parliament. In order to give you an idea of the damage this law has done in the recent elections (when people DID vote for smaller parties out of pure anger and spite), a full 19% of the vote (i.e. more than what the first party got) is NOT REPRESENTED in parliament (i.e. it got 'wasted').

Syriza had the advantage of being an older, more established party (they have always been getting around 5%) and thus they were not seen as a wasted vote.

There are other reasons as well, e.g. the public money a party is allocated for its advertising budget is directly proportional to its last election results (new parties do not get any money at all, which is unfair but very convenient for PASOK and ND). Let's also not forget that PASOK and ND 'own' the largest TV stations and newspapers (not directly, but in an underhanded sort of way).

true,ctolsen,EURO,European Union,"This is a simplified view on the state of the Norwegian penal system. I personally agree that prison is primarily about rehabilitation. It is about retribution to the extent that victims should have a certain peace of mind and to prevent vigilante justice. 

Other than that, it should be obvious that when you welcome people back into society even after murder, rehabilitation is extremely important. And we should be open to experimentation. When you see something that works, you use it. Just like this island. And remember: None of these inmates have their freedom. They're still stuck on that island.

Not everyone agrees, however. There's been a lot of debate in the past few years about sentencing and mandatory minimums, and barely any of it focuses on rehabilitation rates or reintroduction. (This is also why many of the experiments like Bastøy stay out of the public eye for quite a while.)

And all is not good in the Norwegian penal system. One third of our inmates are in there for relatively benign drug crimes. (A relatively high ranking police investigator has said that someting like 4/1000 investigations into drug crimes actually matter.)

Recidivism rates are somewhat high, too. The official rate is about 25%, comparable to several US states like Arizona, Nevada and even Florida. However, this isn't the whole picture. We do something almost no countries do: Incarcerate people short-term for relatively benign traffic crimes. These people obviously have a very low reoffending rate. Also, it is not good considering that our sentences are generally shorter.

The rates are 60-80% for theft and violent crimes. And over 50% for drugs, as we *really* suck at rehabilitating drug addicts -- we have the highest overdose count (not in prison, in general) in Europe.

Just a reminder that even if we're doing a lot of good things, and I like how we think about crime, it's not like we're perfect and something for the world to copy 1:1.

Seeing these articles about hardworking Greeks and ""busting the myths"" never seem to answer my most basic question; if they did everything right, how are we in this situation? How the hell didn't anybody notice about the numbers not adding up (I won't give any anecdotes as they might be ""myths""); the signs had to be there for years. There must have been thousands upon thousands of people who knew that this was not only wrong, but also unsustainable. And yet nobody did anything.  

To paraphrase my father; it isn't about what you do right; it's what you do wrong and aren't willing to do otherwise.

Which correlates with this;

She knew for ten years and didn't do anything. And according to the article:

&gt;There are millions like her. 

If we are meant to take this article as the definite version of what happened to Greece, ignoring all the others that came before it, it isn't giving very good picture. Basically all the good people didn't care, just left the ""liars and crooks"" doing whatever they wanted. Corruption and incompetence. Surely these crooks and liars have been arrested for all the damage they did and are now waiting for their day in court, right? Right?

The problem is, among other things, productivity.

The question *why* exactly productivity is comparably low is a topic worth discussing, and the solution is certainly not simply raising the retirement age.

Granted, they're reporting that meth use is increasing, but they still lump it together with amph. No general study is being done in Norway separating those two. You can see it in seizures and sewer analysis, again, not necessarily a good stat.

But again, the drug-related mortality is mostly due to heroin, methadone and other opioid poisoning. 255 out of 285 deaths in '09 (latest numbers) were in this group.

&gt; Greece still needs its international creditors from the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund, but it needs them much less than when its now-despised bailout program began in 2010.

&gt;How so? The IMF and the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, project that Greece’s primary deficit – that’s the government deficit excluding interest payments – will be 1% of gross domestic product in 2012.

&gt;That’s not too bad. It’s better than the forecast government balances of France, the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland,  and Luxembourg, among others. And it’s way down from the 10.4% primary deficit Greece recorded in 2009 – a sign of how much austerity the country has endured over the past three years.

&gt;The EU and the IMF haven’t been particularly good predictors of anything related to the Greek economy, and in November they were still saying Greece would record a 1% of GDP primary surplus this year. But still, a 1% deficit is in the same ballpark, albeit a pretty large ballpark.

&gt;That means Greece needs much less money from the euro zone and the IMF to continue paying pensions, civil servants and otherwise keep its government running. So, well done to everybody involved! The sound of champagne corks popping should be echoing through the hallways of euro-zone finance ministries, right?

&gt;Uh, not exactly. Anxiety over the Greek program and a possible Greek exit from the euro zone has never been higher. The Greek electorate is furious with its politicians for dragging them through five years (and counting) of recession. A standoff between Greece’s anti-bailout politicians and the euro zone threatens to push Greece out of the single currency area, imposing enormous costs on the Greek economy and destabilizing the euro zone as a whole.

&gt;You’d think given how far Greece has come – and the enormous cost of a euro-zone exit – that euro-zone policymakers would be bending over backwards to diffuse the anti-bailout backlash in Greece.

&gt;But instead, euro-zone politicians are seeking yet more from Greece. They want the government to repay its existing debt, which was just restructured in March, and all its interest payments. This will be no small feat: The commission projects Greek interest payments, even after the restructuring, will be 6.3% of GDP this year and 6.4% in 2013, easily the biggest interest burden in the 27-nation EU.

&gt;With interest payments this large and nominal GDP expected to drop sharply this year and probably next, full repayment is almost certainly impossible. Greece’s deficit excluding interest payments is small, a sign of how much both Greece and the euro zone could benefit from more debt forgiveness. A tough restructuring could transform Greece from the cause of the currency bloc’s collapse to a country with a small deficit, moderate debt, stagnant growth and high unemployment i.e., not much different from the other countries of the euro zone’s troubled periphery.

&gt;From the euro zone’s perspective, that would surely be better outcome than the cataclysmic financial crisis that could be triggered by a Greek exit from the currency bloc.",0,1337436171,null,0,false,0,c4pve1t,t3_tuoef,t1_c4pve1t,t3_tuoef,null,1428957036,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,nestoras,GREE,Greece,"&gt; There must have been thousands upon thousands of people who knew that this was not only wrong, but also unsustainable. And yet nobody did anything.

Yes, there must have been. Let's break them down:

1. Greek politicians: Yes, some of them knew Greece is over-borrowing and over-spending. Too entrenched in party politics, power struggles and one-upping the other party to do anything about it. Nobody wants to be the guy who will 'get the snake out of the hole', as the Greek saying goes. Some of the most honest (and technically minded, because most of them are simply incompetent) ones did secretly notify the Prime Minister (these things are sensitive) that things are not going well (after the Olympics). This became known later. The Prime Minister did not act or did too little too late, for various reasons. Summary: self-serving party interests.
2. Foreign politicians, IMF, ECB, lending banks: They must have surely known. Why did they not do anything? I do not know. Perhaps because the interests of the individual, here and now, weigh more than those of the many, sometime in the future. Why else? I do not buy into the conspiracy theories.
3. Greek citizens: I was born during the 70s, grew up during the 80s and 90s. All I can tell you, is that my country seemed to be doing well, like other civilized countries. People were getting better off, we were a full member of the EU, in good international standing. Businesses were opening left and right, people were buying things such as cars, TVs and computers and Greece seemed to be participating in world events more and more (culminating in the  organization of the 2004 Olympic Games). Sure there was corruption and tax evasion but this was a normal part of life and things seemed to be OK, regardless. Nobody thought ""Oh boy, how did the bank get all this money that they lend me to buy a car? How did Greece become so rich over a decade or two?"". For the average citizen, all this seems to be the natural progression of things. I bet that's what you think for your country right now. Suppose that in ten years you suddenly learn that this prosperity has been fake and that you have been 'over-borrowing' all this time.

As for the unemployment, I've heard Aerospace engineering makes a lot of money in Italy, as other engineering in Italy doesn't make nearly as much as the US does. I guess if I can't land a job by time time I graduate, I can move back to the US where there are much more engineering jobs (I currently have an internship at a small firm).

My goal is to survive college in Italy, get a great education, and (if I'm lucky) find a job in Italy. While I like the US, Italy imho is a much more beautiful country, and I would really like to live there.

However, I feel strongly that this captivity carries great responsibility, and it seems to me that Barcelona's zoo is not fulfilling its responsibilities to the animals--they don't, in fact, appear to be looking after the animals even ""reasonably"" well, and we should ask ourselves if ""reasonably"" well would even be half good enough to settle for.

Taking Susi's case, for example: elephants are highly evolved, highly intelligent, highly social mammals. See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#Social_behavior) and [here](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-moral-lives-animals/201103/the-good-samaritan-elephants) and [here](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-zoos-kill-elephants), for instance.

Susi and Alicia were a tightly knit pair of female elephants. Alicia was the matriarch. When Alicia died, not only did they DISMEMBER HER BODY right in front of Susi, they left the QUARTERED PIECES OF HER BELOVED ALICIA in Susi's cage overnight! This is like a literal elephant psychological terror film, but it's not fiction. It's pretty much the utmost in elephant cruelty and it's what happened. Now Susi is traumatized and deeply depressed, and they have brought in Yo Yo, but 1) [elephants don't bond just like that](http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=immigrant-elephants-stick-together-08-12-10), particularly when they are in such a state of severe psychological anguish, 2) Yo Yo [may be carrying tuberculosis and is reported to be very aggressive](http://www.bornfree.org.uk/campaigns/zoo-check/captive-wildlife-issues/elephants-in-captivity/susi-at-barcelona-zoo/) and 3) Yo Yo is mainly being kept in the medieval underground torture chamber and they are not even together yet.

There is nothing negative or damaging about the campaign to have these elephants freed and moved from what for them is an inner-city prison to an elephant sanctuary, which is sadly still lacking in Europe. There is nothing negative or damaging about exposing the mistreatment of these animals in the zoo. What is negative and damaging is how the zoo is abusing the animals, and if we're going to have a zoo, pressure needs to be brought to bear so that instead of them being looked after ""reasonably"" well, i.e. being terrorized, they are cared for exceptionally well, which is the least that they and our children who will see them deserve.",0,1337444185,null,0,1337465503,0,c4pwj1z,t3_tromv,t1_c4pwj1z,t1_c4pi677,null,1428957574,1,false,Barcelona,t5_2qosg,1

I actually don't think that fiscal policy is super effective in most cases (due to action by the central bank).  Literally the only times in which fiscal stimulus is really important is when either tools for monetary policy break down (the zero bound), or when the problem is so severe that you have to take a kitchen sink approach.  Spain is in that situation right now.  25% unemployment is flat out unacceptable, and yet they're being treated as though their chief problem is the budget deficit.

Two years ago I was singing praises to European solidarity, but after having seen and heard words upon words upon words with the actual amount of change it's brought being close enough to 'fuck all' to make no difference, I'm seriously doubting Greeks' capacity to change at all. He might _say_ it's not like throwing money at a bottomless pit, but the very fact of his election success suggests the bottom isnae visible.

He's right in saying that the real issue is the debt, but even if it were wiped out by a wave of some magic wand, Greece would start building up new debt from that very moment.

Parce que le modèle Autrichien c'est soit le retour à l'étalon or et limiter les leviers, soit le système de banque libre où chaque banque choisit ou émet la monnaie qu'elle souhaite.
Dans les deux cas rien à voir avec la zone euro, qui est plus proche des monétaristes, enfin jusqu'à très récemment vu qu'on commence à vouloir que la banque centrale agisse comme la FED.

Pour ce qui est de l'Islande, la modification de la constitution est bonne pour la démocratie Islandaise, mais il ne faut pas oublier plusieurs choses. La première, c'est que l'Islande, c'est un cailloux peuplé de 320 000 habitants, c'est à dire pas grand monde.
Ensuite l'Islande a commit une erreur qui est lourde de conséquences pour eux, ils ont nationalisé des banques avant que le peuple ne décide (à juste titre !) de refuser de rembourser les dettes de ces banques.
En France nous n'avons pas nationalisé les banques, nous avons directement remboursé leurs dettes.

Dans les deux cas il y à Aléa Moral, les banques sont sauvées par l'état et peuvent donc continuer à faire des conneries (dernièrement JP Morgan aux USA).

Donc voila, l'exemple de l'Islande, il est symbolique, le peuple ne se laisse pas faire et prouve qu'il est carrément moins bête et plus apte à diriger le pays que des technocrates. Mais en attendant, l'exemple Islandais c'est juste de faire défaut de la dette d'une banque, hors sur la dette française, ça pèse peanuts.

Pour le reste de la dette que fait-on ? Si tu veux revenir aux autrichiens, beaucoup se prononcent pour un défaut partiel de la dette publique. ;-)

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;The Prime Minister did not act or did too little too late, for various reasons. Summary: self-serving party interests.

&gt;Sure there was corruption and tax evasion but this was a normal part of life and things seemed to be OK, regardless.

Corruption is probably unavoidable, but it's never something one should accept, but always to fight against.

And I'm not saying Finland is perfect - recently one of our MPs were convicted for having a birthday party thrown to him by corporate interests. On another instance an MP was convicted for having granted money to association he was a member in. Few years earlier a minister had to resign for granting money for a golf field company she owned stock in. And so on. 

These things happen. Some probably got past the radar, but if things register on radar, it should be looked into and and everything discriminating should be brought to light and court date assigned.

Not being lawyer, I can't be sure, but based on what you wrote about your former PM, one would think there would be enough evidence to at least charge for high treason and probably several other MP's as well. If having a birthday party is enough to get 15 months suspended service due to corruption, I'm pretty sure intentionally driving your nation to bankruptcy is at least finable offence as well.

&gt;Foreign politicians, IMF, ECB, lending banks: They must have surely known.

Foreign politicians surely knew. It was known that Greece had cooked the books to get into euro,  and the figures given afterwards were suspect as well. But the rules said that we had to believe on the data you provided. If it was cooked, there wasn't anything one could do. Doing otherwise would have been against Greek sovereignty.

Some of the lending banks must have known as well, as I understand some of the banks helped do that cooking. 

Don't know anything about IMF or ECB, but I don't think they had much authority back then, when things were going ok.

&gt;People were getting better off, we were a full member of the EU, in good international standing. Businesses were opening left and right, people were buying things such as cars, TVs and computers and Greece seemed to be participating in world events more and more (culminating in the organization of the 2004 Olympic Games).

OK, I get that. Thanks for typing that out. 

&gt;I bet that's what you think for your country right now. Suppose that in ten years you suddenly learn that this prosperity has been fake and that you have been 'over-borrowing' all this time.

I'm a bit younger than you, but I still remember the time before [Finnish Banking Crisis of the early 90s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_banking_crisis_of_1990s). It was mostly caused by relaxation of banking norms, and not by corruption, but the end result was the same. Everything was swell and then the music stopped. Unemployment rose and peaked at 18,4% (I understand that Greece is now around 13%). But life goes on. We did heavy cutting on social services, lent heavily to put a lot of money into the banks to keep them somewhat stable (they later paid back), prosecuted some banksters and redid the banking laws. In time things went to normal again. 

But I don't have a cent of debt on my name and neither do many others of my generation. I haven't even taken student loans, preferring to work for the expenses that I couldn't cover with student allowance. Seeing to where lending led in the 90s was more than enough. I suppose that some day I'll take a mortgage and buy [a flat/a house], but not before I have half the money on the bank account and can be reasonably sure that I can keep myself employed till I pay back the other half. 

But still, things aren't optimal. Big part of the pension money was lost in the recent upheaval, the baby boomers are retiring and the exports aren't really looking that good either. We're lending money and giving it to you, Greece, in hope that we can make things a bit better and perhaps have the luxury of thinking stuff like retirement ages in five years. 

Instead we hear stuff like blaming us for lending you and acting in a manner that makes one think that not only did we waste our 3 billion euros (which is a big sum for a country of our size), we might actually have made things worse. And blamed for it. 

Not fun.

I'm striking out my comment too, however I still disagree with you that the blame lies on Maria and the millions like her.

Yeah, as I said, I got a bit heated and I regret it.

Oh, but it's fine to binge drink to an extreme nearly every weeked and stumble home black-out drunk at 5 AM on Saturday, a very popular activity in Sweden (and, I suspect, the other Scandinavian countries)--this would certainly qualify as alcohol abuse and make the people who do it alcoholics, but they see nothing wrong with this while simultaneously thinking anyone who smokes one marijuana cigarette is severely mentally ill and in desperate need of arrest and forced treatment and rehabilitation :/",0,1337452726,null,0,false,0,c4pxwjk,t3_tujo8,t1_c4pxwjk,t1_c4pxtk0,null,1428958225,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

There's also been a growing problem with illegal immigration. If you can get a visa to Canada or Mexico, you can make it to the States, period.

exactly, so unanimity applies in tax rules, for as long as any nation has objections to majority voting in this area. 

I don't understand your point with quoting QMV changes though; old or new system, majority voting is majority voting and any area covered by it is obviously an area where a country doesn't have a veto anymore. 

Basically, there are areas where the ""community method"" of deciding fully applies, with comission having the monopoly of initiative, any decision having to get support from both 'houses' of the legislative, with the parliament voting by majority, and the council by qualified majority, and the luxemburg court acting as the constitutional court, having competence over eg. the correctness of transcription of a directive created in this manner into national law.

And then there are areas not yet covered by this system, for eg taxation and foreign policy, or further transfer of competencies via either passerelle clauses etc.

The only difference between the old and the new QMV rules is basically that things become much easier to pass under the new system, and there is a reshuffling of voting strengths of various countries - relative winners basically being the very small and the largest, and mid-sized countries, say something like portugal, sweden, austria, bulgaria, lose in power.

Now the fact things can more easily pass the council means the parliament can be more assertive w/o blocking decision-making, too.

It would be easier to remain fair in opinion pieces, such as debates, because you can present simultaneously and with the same treatment multiple differing stances on a single matter.

As you mention, true objectivity can hardly be achieved in media even if one tries, because for every issue there's an infinite number of aspects to consider and a limited amount of time and resources to cover it, and what you do or don't show biases that coverage.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The Lisbon Treaty makes qualified majority voting in the Council the general rule for EU law-making.

&gt;Furthermore, it foresees a general passerelle in art. 48.7 TEU: the European Council can move unanimity to QMV in all areas of the TFEU, including CFSP (except defence - see 48.7.1 TEU). 

I hope you understand that in that sentence 'the Council' and 'European Council' are two completely different bodies. 'the Council' is the council of ministers - or officially, the 'Council of the European Union', and it does decide on most but not all questions by qualified majority already before Lisbon - and in even more areas after. 

'European Council' is the council of heads of government, that generally decides by unanimity, though for some matters, like confirming the most important offices in the EU bodies, by a supermajority rule - which isn't about to change, and is different from qualified majority. I forget the number, and won't dig since it's completely tangental, but I think its 72% of members. In any case, it decides by unanimity in using passerelle clauses or revision procedures.

You are severely misunderstanding the treaty if you're trying to imply that any move from unanimity to qualified majority would be in any way related to the changes in how the qualitied majority is calculated though.

Lisbon treaty did expand the scope of qualified majority decision-making. Though not to taxation. But, there will be exactly zero new policy areas that will move to qualified majority by the virtue of the qualified majority rules change in 2014 and 2017. 

The way to expand qualified majority decision-making without the laborious process or re-negotiating the treaty itself, is via some specific and the general passerelle clauses. All of which require unanimity for the change. Or via the simplified revision procedure, which has the same characteristic.

One thing I wanted to pick up on was this statement:

&gt;Now the Euro Zone needs not 'lend' Greece $130 billion. It could, instead, simply pay the creditors--directly--eliminating the restructured debt. This leaves Greece intact to carry on, no austerity required and a single debt consolidated to payback to the Euro Zone at low interest.

&gt;If the Euro Zone wants to ensure that Greece doesn't damage them. Then, it would let Greece out of the Euro until it pays-back, proves stability and stops running a deficit economy. It's easy for the IMF to ensure that the drachma doesn't devalue 80%.

This seems like the juncture in which we are switching from economics to politics. The Eurozone has no rules, regulations, or even precedent with which to structure and implement a process such as this. Furthermore, despite being what seems a very logical thing to do, the underlying issue seems to be to what degree other European countries are willing to step up to help Greece out. We go back to our U.S. example of states helping other states here.

I agree, the core of europe will not indefinitely tolerate UK sabotaging their desire to integrate further. Now, various provisions for enhanced cooperation as well as the special rules for eurozone go into the direction of a two speed structure, leaving the eurosceptic lands on the fringes of the more integrated core.

But being on the fringes of something is more dangerous than blocking the creation of such core, so I think stalling and sabotage is the reason UK even wants to be inside.

&gt;with the move away from unanimity in some areas being one of them.

Still, on the short run, UK can indeed veto any move to qualified majority rule in areas where it doesn't suit it. I thought you were implying otherwise.

But, FTT is not the only new tax measure currently proposed. 

Harmonization of corporate taxation, though w/o the EU collecting it directly, is under way, as a harmonized taxbase calculation, in an extranational regime, for the companies that choose it. For accounting convenience. This will happen as an enhanced cooperation system if UK blocks it, though I think the difficult party that really should go into it is Ireland in this case.

Comission recently proposed a number of options for a new 'own resource', ie EU tax, with the FTT being only one among them. Not even the one chosen in the end - what they wish to see is an EU-collected carbon tax for now. A direct 1% EU VAT was also proposed, as was a couple of others. The logic behind VAT was to be in direct contact with the citizens, and also to demonstrate vividly to them how tiny EU budget is in comparison. 

Such taxation competencies would in fact be nothing new, since the EU initially and still finances itself through common customs and tariffs, only due to world trade liberalization and growing budget, now such financing is a minority of its budget. But it is seen as strategically significant for the EU system to be financed by proper 'own resources' rather than merely through (admittedly obligatory) transfers from the national budgets, as is mostly financed now. This avoids the 'relative contributions' debate over the size and composition of the EU budget, year after year, and gives states less options to blackmail the EU over.",0,1337463495,null,0,1337464178,0,c4pzntw,t3_tuhep,t1_c4pzntw,t1_c4pz8on,null,1428959121,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

No.

&gt;These laws would be the average of everyones lines in a democracy and will be under murder and above picking your nose in public.

No, that's the thing. It's not one line. It's a bunch of lines, and all of them should be proportially punished if broken.

That's what I meant with a line drawer. Everything below is legal, and everything above that is a capital crime and people prefer if we execute those. But it's not one line at all. And if we lockup some one for life that murders their spouse in rage, what is the proportional punishment for a serial killer? or a terrorist?

I don't think it's useful to ruin somebody's life forever, when they cross that single line. If only to communicate that, generally speaking, bad behavior is not just caused by a single person, but by a single person interacting and finding a place in society. That we are the product of our own choices, but also our environment. 

That when one person commits a very serious crime, that person did not just fail us. We failed as well. We share some of that responsibility.  From child molesters that were themselves molested as children to people just snapping and not being able to deal with life. 

And it's too easy to just draw a single line in the sand, and say everybody below that line is an innocent victim and everybody above that line is a unforgiveable criminal. It's a continuum.  Yet, the kind of 'we must punish harder' rethorics, are all about that. If that's the intent, why not just kill them? If you don't think they deserve another shot at life, why not go the full mile? But next election, we move the line a line, and suddenly some of the hardliners will find themselves at the other side of the line, if only just by a toe. 

Now, I don't know, if more violent places generally cause a more harsh penal system, or if it's the other way around. But it has been said, that the level of 'civilization' can be judged by just looking at how a society treats their criminals. The role of the state is not to revenge, but to lead by example of how people should treat each other. To set the tone of civility.

So, IMHO, The state should always show more mercy, than a person could. Understanding that many of the lines aren't that fixed in stone, that intention and background do play a role, that people aren't perfect and make mistakes.

For example: Englischer Garten is awesome, as well as Isar banks / Flaucher in the south of Munich. Another thing is Gärtnerplatz, which is always crowded at night. I love the clubs in Munich. Also, the countryside around Munich is great. You're in the Alps (skiing!) within an hour and a half by car/train.
You won't have trouble with the dialect.
Unfortunately I have to agree with yeahwhynot_, it's hard to find a flat in Munich. Either you're lucky or you will need some time to find a flat/room.

To the costs (in Munich):

- 350-500€ for a room in a shared flat in maxvorstadt/schwabing (~=center of munich). Less if you're lucky, less if you go farther outside.

- Something around 600€ for a one bedroom apartement (not 100% sure about that)

- groceries are very cheap in all of germany, compared to the rest of Europe/North America

- I pay 20€/month for my cellphone, 30€ for internet + landline + cable tv

- speaking of entertainment (as example, clubbing): 5-10€ entry fee, 3-4,5€ for a beer, 7-9€ for a longdrink.
7€ for a mass of beer (~1 liter) in a biergarten. biergartens are awesome!

- public transportation: 35-60€/months, depends on whether you are a student or not. I don't use public transportation, I go by bike everywhere and love it. I don't think you need a car in Munich.

I have never lived in Bavaria, but tech wise this is where it's mostly happening in Germany. Other than that there are only 2 real ""cities"" in Germany: Hamburg and Berlin that clock in with over 1 million people. Berlin is definitely the cheaper, ruder, yet more lively one. If you like the honest in your face but from the heart style, than Berlin might be it.

If you want to stay in Germany and go for a career I think Munich would be your best choice. But be aware, they suck at football. (Don't like Bayern Muenchen, but Schweini deserves a hug tonight. So many finals :/)

The prices should be roughly the same as in Toronto, maybe even lower. (One of the reasons we choose Montreal. Close to downtown, a nice 6 1/2, $1150) Those prices are rather unusual in Germany though.

I don't know how deep your pockets are, but you might want to have a look at Switzerland, specifically the ETH in Zurich (http://www.ethz.ch/index_EN). 

If it's a really good education you want, this is a place to look at. World class and if you like living there you'll definitively can make a nice career there as well. (I partially grew up there and work there for years) 

Also it takes you 1 hour to go to Germany, 2 hours to go skiing, 3 hours to Italy and 4 to the mediterranean from Zurich. 

As everywhere else, if you're an engineer and you know what you're doing you're easily in the range that doubles the average household income. Currently there are some moves to try and lower the engineers salaries in Germany, but if you stick to your guns, actually like what you're doing and don't want to ascend into management in the next few years you'll be well off. Not rich, but money isn't going to be your primary concern.

Oh yeah, to understand the Bavaria vs. the rest thing. It's not like Quebec vs. the rest of Canada at all. More like Alberta right now.

true,BroBecker,null,null,"I am from the center of Germany but have lived in quite a few different cities. The cliché about Bavarians is that they are self righteous, smug and conservative. This is mostly bullshit as with most clichés. This might be true if you live somewhere in a village in southern Bavaria but Munich is a beautiful multicultural city with pretty friendly and outgoing people. And they are talking normal german over there as well, so you will be able to understand them. It boggles my mind how some kid from a village in the middle of nowhere in northern Germany will call a Municher backwards but that strangely happens. Munich is the headquarter for most of Germany's biggest companies and as such there are plenty of foreigners and you are welcome. It is an expensive city though, that much is true.

Berlin is cheaper, even more international, more artsy and alternative, generally more shabby and definitively cheaper. If you are into Arts and culture or politics, Berlin is the place for you. There is however almost no industry in Berlin, so your chances of finding a job as engineer are slimmer.

Aachen is probably the best engineering Uni out of the lot (TU Munich is also very good though). The University is quite closely connected with several businesses. Aachen itself is said to be nice but boring. If you are looking to drink lots of beer with friendly guys, it's great. If you're planing to see some girls too or do some cultural activities, it's tough. After all it is a city of engineering students.

As already mentioned RWTH is definitely a great university but the city really might not be the best for going out, meeting girls etc. because a big part of the population consists of engineers. They job situation should be second best in Germany in the Ruhrgebiet. Only bested by Bavaria.

When considering TUM you have to keep in mind that the campus for engineers is in Garching, not directly in the middle of Munich and it can be a pain to always have to ride into the city even though it isn't that far. Garching by itself is even worse than Aachen considering partys and girls. That beeing said you get a top education from the TUM and nightlife in Munich itself is awesome! Just the rents in Munich are pretty high but the Engineering Sector in Bavaria, expecially around Munich, is very big and if you are qualified you shouldn't have problems finding a well paying job. Oh and the ""rumors"" about Bavaria might apply to small towns in the ""outback"" of Bavaria but definitely not Munich, which is very international, open and theyspeak normal German (mostly). :)

Now to Karlsruhe. The KIT is also one of the best engineering schools in Germany, ranging just as high as RWTH or TUM. The University is located right in the middle of the city and overall the whole city is pretty awesome. Great nightlife, partys... I can only recommend looking into it further.

I can't say that much to Darmstadt. I have not heard any great things from the University. The city can be pretty nice, though I would recommend the the others first, except Aachen. ;)

You should just check all of the citys out when you visit and see if any of them fit your requirements.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Capitalism means to be entitled to the labour of others through ownership of the capital. The most obvious example of capitalism is paying rent. The owner does not labour but they still expect to be paid. This sort of thing is what anti-capitalists criticise, not the liberty to open shops and make products.

Except that capital has been accumulated by working for it. For example I have bought my own apartment by taking a 25 year loan from the bank, which I will pay by working. After I have paid the loan, the apartment is fully mine. Now in the future, if I don't want or can't any more live in my apartment, and decide to either rent or sell it, isn't it right that I will be compensated for all those worked years?

I would also like to point out positive sides of renting...

* I went to study into a university 300km away from my parents home, without the ability to rent I couldn't have studied in a place of my choosing.
* After studies were over, I relocated for work, to a town 450km away from my place of studies, after the recession started I again moved into the capital city, moving another 200km. Without the ability to rent, I wouldn't have been able to as flexible as was needed to work.
* In the next 35 years in working life, it is more or less certain that I need to relocate inside the country and have to spend at least few years out of the country in order to gain maximum output what I can give in my work. Again ability to rent is must.

I really don't understand the stand that renting is bad.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"You're right in that EU isn't living up to the title of ""community of independent states"". 

The whole definition of EU has been under work for the last 20 years. You note that ""European Communities"" was the name before we integrated to the point of calling ourself an union? After abandoning that, we've gone through two or three updates on the rules. Each time toward more democratic direction, I think.

Personally I like the word ""confederation"", as it's nicely well defined one instead of a big bunch strange words that's hard to grasp (though I suppose that there being federations that call themselves confederations muddles up the waters somewhat).

Anyway, pure confederations aren't very stable entities. Most have lasted historically only few years before breaking down or, when trying to compensate for the brittleness, turned into federations (United States being a good example). Also please remember that this isn't only about how the whole thing is organised, but also how much power European Parliament, Council of Ministers etc. has. Russian Federation is completely different beast from the German Federation! :) So it's not just about the offices, it's also about how much power they have.

I understand where you're coming from. Still, I don't think European Assembly as an idea is that good one. First, because complicated organisations that only few people can manipulate (in this case, the party leaders) become easily corrupted. Second, people might not want to vote the same people or parties on different levels. Third, if MEPs were also national MPs, they would fall under curtail of the Council of Ministers, in which case the former couldn't work as a counterweight to the latter. For example, in the ACTA-case, CoM was wholehearted proponents for it, while EP were against. If the doors to EP went through the ministers (which tend to be party leaders in their homelands) the MEPs would have no way of putting their foot down without paying for it dearly.

As I see it, Parliament is just one more stage over local council and national parliament. It's the part of EU that works the best, and the one part I would be most hesitant to change.

I have issues with Council of Ministers, but each country gets one vote there, so can't really say it isn't democratic either. The people there seem to bring the worst out of each other, but it's clearly working as intended, so I don't see that one could do much to change it. 

Commission is really the place where we have the biggest problems. The candidates are chosen by local leaders according to backdoor-politics and EP has to vote for them as one, which means that singular commissar-candidate has to be really unsuitable for EP to reject the whole bunch (I can only remember one time this has happened; the candidate was well-known proponent against women's rights). The way the commissars are chosen and then elected should be better done, but I don't really know how.

I'd also wish that the President of the Commission would be more public figure. Barroso is the most powerful singular person of the EU power-structure and you really don't see him in the news.

After doing my Bachelor's in mech eng in Canada, during which I did some schooling and internships in Germany, I decided to do my Master's in Fahrzeugtechnik. I got accepted to almost all of the same universities as you listed and ended up going to the TU München. Why München? Mostly because I had already been living there and so I already had friends and I also enjoyed the weekly snowboarding trips to the alps as well as the Biergartens. From what I had read, the RWTH and the TU München are the best for Fahrzeugtechnik. I had visited Aachen a few times and there's really not much going on there, so if you're looking for a good nightlife and single girls, it's not ideal.

The main thing I didn't like about the TUM is that it's so huge and somewhat impersonal. Based on experiences during my year-long exchange at the TU Braunschweig, it's probably safe to say that I would have gotten to know more people and felt more ""connected"" to the university if it had been smaller. Most of my Munich friends I knew through things other than school. Another downside to the TUM is that it's outside the city in Garching, so the transit pass will cost about 70€/month and it'll take you between 20 minutes and an hour to get there (though I didn't mind the long ride that much cause it gave me time to read). The TUM is definitely good from an academic standpoint, though, and there are a lot of interesting research projects to get involved in. I definitely don't regret my decision.

As for living costs as a student here, I paid 260€/month for a room in a shared apartment in a student residence. That includes utilities and internet. The cheapest student residences in Munich go down to about 230€, so it's not THAT much more expensive than other cities and groceries are relatively cheap all over Germany. It's true that the Munich bars and clubs tend to be more expensive than in other cities, but there are lots of student parties where you can drink on the cheap. For a phone I just use a prepaid for 9c per minute and per text... don't usually spend more than 15€/month.

I still live in Munich and work at BMW, so if the auto industry is where you want to be, there are good opportunities here. If you want to do aerospace, you basically have to choose between Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich. The pay here is typically 45-50k€, with the take-home being about 60% of that. I pay 400€/month for a nice 60 m² apartment shared with my girlfriend. Groceries are about 150€/month. Transit pass is about 60€/month. So really, my basic living expenses are only 25-30% of my net income.

Je suis actuellement assistant de français en Angleterre mais j'ai fait mes études à la Sorbonne (je suis français, pour clarifier).

Qu'est-ce que tu vas étudier là-bas ? Moi j'ai étudié en LLCE Anglais, donc selon ce que tu fais, certaines choses que je vais te dire peuvent être plus ou moins vraies.

La première chose que tu dois savoir, c'est que je ne cherche pas à te faire peur avec ce post. Ce que tu vas lire n'est qu'un avertissement pour te préparer à certaines galères bien spécifiques. 

La Sorbonne accepte quasiment n'importe qui avec un baccalauréat. Tu dois te demander en quoi ça te concerne. L'université a un prestige à conserver, et bien qu'il n'y ait pas de concours d'entrée à proprement parler, il y a bel et bien une sélection ""officieuse"" qui prend place afin d'éliminer les mauvais éléments...et cela se traduit par : faire de la vie des étudiants un enfer.^^ Cette ""sélection"" se déroule en deux temps :

* Premièrement, le processus administratif pour les inscriptions est intentionnellement très compliqué et tordu. Secrétaires constamment en pause café, secrétariats fermés aux heures d'ouverture, administrations déplacées dans d'autres bâtiments...it's all a bloody mess. Si tu es perdue, je te suggère d'engager la conversation avec d'autres étudiants : c'est grâce aux galères administratives que je me suis fait mes premiers amis !

* Deuxièmement, les examens. Alors que la plupart des universités américaines sont très portées sur les QCM (questionnaires à choix multiples), à la Sorbonne, c'est une autre affaire. Prépare-toi à rédiger des dissertations longues comme le bras avec une méthodologie rigoureusement française, qui est radicalement différente de l'approche américaine. Les examens sont souvent très difficiles, mais tu devrais t'en sortir si tu étudies suffisamment et si tu as plein d'amis pour t'aider !

Pour voir les choses du bon côté : la Sorbonne dispose d'enseignants qui sont pour la plupart extrêmement compétents, les meilleurs dans leurs domaines respectifs. Tu te retrouveras sûrement à acheter un bouquin écrit par un de tes professeurs, car on parle de spécialistes nationaux (voire internationaux). Je pense que tu peux apprendre beaucoup en allant là-bas. Aussi, la plupart des étudiants sont vraiment sympas, donc n'hésite pas à demander si tu es perdue.

Pour l'italien, je suis sûr que ça peut se faire.

The Church is anti-abortion, anti-premarital sex, and anti-divorce. If people were following the Church they would be getting married even earlier to avoid premarital sex, and they would then have more children, and not divorce. Instead, they are having premarital sex, having small families (one, maybe two children. [1.4 is the average](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)) and [a large number divorce](http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-12-21/entertainment/27085086_1_divorce-rate-marital-relations-russia). As the map shows, they also have many abortions.

The real reason is legacy of the Soviet Union, where other birth control methods were hard to come by in any sort of reliable and regular manner but abortions were readily available and free, and presented as a purely medical issue. Abortions are still perceived that way far more than they are in the West. At the same time, birth control remains expensive, there are popular beliefs that the hormones in birth control pills can damage  a woman's health and there is a [cultural bias against condoms](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/sifp/2008/00000039/00000001/art00001) (this last issue is also a problem when combating STDs). As I mentioned above, people want smaller families as well. The end result is that women get pregnant more often than do women in the West, and when they do, they are more likely to have an abortion.

TL;DR Abortion rates in the FSU are the result mostly of policies of the atheist USSR supported by curent cultural trends, and are the opposite of what the Orthodox Church wants and promotes.

After two years of studying in German, I was good enough to do job interviews without any problems. The benefit of studying here is that when you graduate, you get a 12-month residence permit to look for a job. And when a company considers hiring you, they don't have to follow the rules of the so-called Vorrangprüfung, which normally requires them to hire EU nationals over foreigners, unless the foreigner is somehow specially qualified. So basically, to them you're viewed as good of a potential employee as any German who was in the same University program as you (assuming your German is adequate).

true,PredictionBoom,null,null,"I'd just like to add my 2 cents. I'm 26, I studied near Munich and i'm working there right now. I'll be moving to Berlin this autumn, as my girlfriend lives there.

First of all: I think Berlin is the way to go if having a great time is your number 1 priority. I can almost guarantee that you'll love it. It's an extremely international city. Most young berliners are used to talking English on many occasions because of that, and the German in the north is much easier to understand (the regional dialects become stronger the further south you go). You'll meet loads of people from all over the world, as well as many fellow Canadians - that can really help when you feel homesick every now and then.  The costs of living are lower than in the south, too. The rents *can* be high, depending on the area you want to live in, because the city just keeps growing and growing, but overall you'll be fine. Compared to other european metropolises it's a steal. The Berlin night life is a league of its own, and you'll need a lot of self-discipline to not be hungover seven days a week  :)

Don't write off Munich too early, however. It's a great city, too, it just feels completely different. Berlin is a crazy, screaming punk, while Munich is a talented, beautiful diva with some annoying quirks and whims. While bavaria is, overall, more conservative than the rest of Germany, there's a huge difference between Munich and the surrounding rural areas. Munich is an extremely friendly and open city, with a great night life of it's own - just not as excessive as Berlin. Clubs close at 7 or 8 in the morning, there's more police on the streets, the laws are a tad stricter, and shops have shorter business hours. Everything's a bit posher. But don't be scared by the word ""conservative""! You won't be chased by bavarian mobs with pitchforks, there are simply more people who vote for the more conservative parties. The poeple who feel like they don't fit in the surrounding rural towns often move to Munich because the climate there is so different and relaxed. It may take some time to get used to the Bavarian accents however, especially when you visit the surrounding areas (for hiking or skiing, the alpine upland is stunning). The big upside for you could be the Bavarian economy: Munich is filled with big corporations, engineers are in extremely high demand, and the salaries are almost the highest in all of Germany. (Average Munich salaries are ranked #2 in Germany, Frankfurt is #1 because of its huge banking sector, Berlin is ranked #50 - [source](http://www.stepstone.de/Karriere-Bewerbungstipps/gehalt/in-welcher-region-wird-am-besten-verdient.cfm)) **Edit:** I just read that you're interested in the automotive sector.

Our country would be far far better off financially not supporting US actions in the middle east.

AND REMEMBER THIS: One of the reasons that the US pays so much is so that it can have bases in Europe to protect sovereign US soil as well as give it a launchpad for operations into eastern countries. These bases serve absolutely no purpose in protecting the EU.

As a result, annual reported abortions have fallen from about 130,000 per year in the mid 1980s to about 160 per year in 1999-2004**.Poland is widely criticized by abortion proponents for its current policy. Some have also claimed that the Polish abortion law has not really impacted abortion rates.
