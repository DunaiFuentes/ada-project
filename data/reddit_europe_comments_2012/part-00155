true,Fiedryn,null,null,"&gt;Do you honestly think demanding reparations from Germany now [...]would have any significantly positive effect on the Greek economy?

It goes without saying that a sudden income of billions in reparations would have a very positive result to pretty much any economy. Is that really even a question? 

But you seem to have completely misunderstood me. While Germany has a *duty* to pay their debts like any other country in the world (including Ireland, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece. They are in no way special in comparison to these countries), it is not to be expected for Germany to pay their debts in the short term, even if they wanted to. 

Therefore, some kind of arrangement or flexible type of repayment should be considered in the long-term. For now, it is simply disgraceful for Germany to adopt the single most strict stance towards countries in debt, when Germany in fact has a massive debt towards these countries.

From purely economic to deontological perspectives, Germany's policy today is  ridiculous and inexplicable. If Germany can just write off debts and promote such destructive austerity policies towards countries it certainly owes too, so should countries like Italy or Greece.

Of course, because two wrongs don't make one right, that shouldn't be done either, and a consensus must be found between these countries.


&gt;(Expecting Germany to pay for more 65 years of interest is ridiculous btw.)

Expecting for Germany to pay for anything when it can avoid it through political manouevres is ridiculous, anyway, so this is a moot point.

&gt;How would you explain to a young German that you deserve money for crimes that his/her great-grandfather has commited?

As opposed to a young Greek who never voted for the governments his parents or grandparents did? And who has to face a 50% youth unemployment?

Or are perhaps, his or her parents or grandparents at fault, for voting (for 40 years, now) for governments who constantly lied to them and had zero essential transparency? Do they deserve for their life expectancy to be reduced significantly or for their pensions to go unpaid for years?

Kudos must go to Germany for smartly redeveloping itself post-WW2 (something that Greece didn't do, either under dictatoric or democratic regimes), but it must be realized, that as soon as they made a profit, they made the choice to invest in further domestic development and not repay their debts. If it is fine for Germany to do this, why shouldn't everyone else in debt do so? That is problematic to say the least.

Even if we ignore the massive war reparation debts, the massive low to zero interest loans the Germans ""took"" (as in: stole under the nose of puppet governments) from many European banks in World War 2 are still sitting, (as numbers), for all means and purposes in the German state bank.

Again, under which right are German governments entitled to not play by the rules, yet demand for everyone else to do so?

There is far more revenue value wise than VAT applicable sales value wise - hence the reason why only a few % is needed .

In an ironic way, it would seem that the country who had it worse percentage-wise, Poland, is moving along the same lines as Greece on the matter of war reparations, providing for yet another flaw in that logic. With the war reparations being a condition under the peace treaty, and Germany having failed to comply by that condition raises certain questions, but certainly doesn't suddenly remove the right to demand for reparations by victim-countries. By that logic, let's return Vichy France's territory back to Germany while we're at it. Even if this right to war reparations was to magically vanish, the low interest loans that Germany took forcefully during the war have yet to be repaid. And if war reparations can just be ignored, loans can't. Or can they? If they can, then no country currently in debt should have to repay their loans a la Germany. Re: your constant use of Estonia as an example, congrats on them developing smartly, unlike the Greeks, but on which grounds can they demand reparations from Russia? As far as I am aware, the Russians never agreed to any sort of treaty which included reparations.

&gt;Edit: I'd also like to correct you of your comparison with the Polish casualites.
Here[1] is a Wiki article about that. 16,5 % of the Polish popolation died, 4,5 % of the Greek ones. No, you did not have half as many causalties.

Actually, you should check your source:
&gt;Gregory Frumkin, who was throughout its existence editor of the Statistical Year-Book of the. League of Nations gave the following assessment of Greek losses in the war. He points out that that, ""**the data on Greek war losses are frequently divergent and even inconsistent**"". His estimates for Greek losses are as follows: The war dead included 20,000 military deaths in the Greco-Italian War of 1940–41, 60,000 non-Jewish civilians, 20,000 non Jewish deportees, 60,000 Jews and 140,000 famine deaths during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II[235]
The Greek National Council for Reparations from Germany reports the following casualties during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. Military dead: 35,077 including, 13,327 killed in the Greco-Italian War of 1940–41; 1,100 with the Greek Forces in the Mid East and 20,650 partisan deaths. Civilian Deaths: 771,845 including: 56,225 executed by Axis forces; 105,000 dead in German concentration camps (including Jews); 7,120 deaths due to bombing, 3,500 merchant marine dead, and 600,000 war related famine deaths[236] Jewish Holocaust victims totaled 69,500.

While the GNCRG could be more likely biased than Frumkin, Frumkin himself admits that his source material (the reports) were inconsistent, while there is no mention of Frumkin's sources either.

In fact, no one really knows the number of Greek casualties during WW2. It could be well over 10% for all we know. There were severe problems with the estimates, as even several years after WW2 and the Civil War, there were reports of massive voter fraud through the use of identification of dead family members.

My source was this: http://www.secondworldwarhistory.com/world-war-2-statistics.asp

It's detailed analysis of US victims made it rather attractive, though I suppose that it is no better a source than Frumkin or the GNCRG. After all, the major partisan groups may have ""minimized"" their casualties, and generally didn't have any reason to provide detailed reports to the government, as they were in terrible terms with them, after the war.

Along with that, the general population lived under terrible conditions under the occupations, rendering the burrial of famine victims crude and of course not recordable with good precision.

&gt; If there's no majority, elect a government (say eliminating weakest candidate round by round until one remains). if the parliament wants to censure the government, it should need to name and so elect a new one in the same motion etc.

As a Dutch person, big no (assuming I am interpreting your statement right). The idea of a single party holding the majority in parliament just sound wrong wrong wrong. Especially if you need to eliminate the small parties to do so. One of the major advantages of the parliamentary system is the abundance of choice. I am able to vote for a party that I actually like and agree with (not just the party I dislike and disagree with the least). And while they may not be a part of the coalition they still do good work (passing motions, amendments and even the occasional law).

&gt; Also it can make the parliamentary term fixed or near-fixed, which is a bit fairer than the government being able to choose the time of the election.

That sounds a lot better. One of the issues with a parliamentary system is that near the end of the term maintaining the coalition becomes a liability to a parties performance in the next elections, creating a rather perverse incentive for a coalition member to blow up it's own coalition after ~3 years. (I think we had about 6 parliamentary elections in the past 10 years.) Though I think it would require a decoupling of cabinet and coalition. De-politicizing ministers, have the parliament assign them based on merit not political affiliation. So that when a coalition falls and a new one forms (without intervening elections cause the term aint over), you don't end up with ministers enacting (or worse, refusing to eneact) policies they personally disagree with.

The era of cheap credit kinda skewed this a bit as poorer people who otherwise couldn't afford luxury goods suddenly found that they could now borrow money and be able to buy things they wouldn't have been able to otherwise.

Oh, goodness, no, def not. A proportional parliament as is. I'm speaking of the procedures for electing the prime minister from the parliament, and how one could make it impossible for a government not to form, if one would wish. Seemed relevant given recent Belgian situation. Now Germany doesn't do exactly this, but goes a long way in that direction:



&gt; (1) The Federal Chancellor shall be elected by the Bundestag without debate on the proposal of the Federal President.

&gt; (2) The person who receives the votes of a majority of the Members of the Bundestag shall be elected. The person elected shall be appointed by the Federal President.

&gt; (3) If the person proposed by the Federal President is not elected, the Bundestag may elect a Federal Chancellor within fourteen days after the ballot by the votes of more than one half of its Members.

&gt; (4) If no Federal Chancellor is elected within this period, a new election shall take place without delay, in which **the person who receives the largest number of votes shall be elected.** If the person elected receives the votes of a majority of the Members of the Bundestag, the Federal President must appoint him within seven days after the election. If the person elected does not receive such a majority, then within seven days **the Federal President shall either appoint him or dissolve** the Bundestag.

So they make a first-past-the-post election of the prime minister in the parliament if all else fails. And have new elections or just keep him/her, depending of what the president think is a good idea. So in the end, they'll get a government one way or another...

Only thing one could need to tweak in this procedure to ensure at least a proper minority government to form is to make that final vote be a multiple-round runoff. So when the parliament votes to elect the prime minister, if the top candidate didn't get a majority, eliminate the bottom candidate and members of parliament vote in a new round among the remaining ones, untill the top candidate does have a majority - which is guaranteed to happen at least by the time only two prime ministarial candidates remain. 

I think they do something like this for the president. Ofc a lot faster way of doing this would be with ranked voting and some calculation like Schulze's (not instant runoff, for its formal failings), but this has some tradition of use in politics and is easier to understand, and the parliament isn't too big to go at it multiple times.

And since the parliament cannot censure the government without simultaneously voting in another (constructive non-confidence vote only), there is no possibility of not having a government (only a possibility of a weak one). And no need for any provisions for early elections, really.. 

So, one needn't go all the way there - germany doesn't - but some aspects of the model might make the parliamentary democracies which have an issue with government stability more manageable.

true,Fiedryn,null,null,"&gt;Of all the countries that suffered through WWII, Greece is the only country arguing that WWII reparations are responsible for the state that they are in today.
&gt;So, still not leading up to Poland's 16 % - yet they are not are blaming their financial problems on the Germans. You are.
&gt;In fact, Greece is the only country still arguing about this like mad

For crying out loud, what on earth are you even on about? 

Have you managed to demonize Greece in your mind to the extent of actually believing that Greece is blaming its financial problems on WW2, specifically the Germans, and raving like mad about the reparations?

In the case you eventually wake up from this hate-filled little manufactured reality, you will realize that the greek government has passed two- three by the time this week ends, IMF-proposed memorandums in an attempt to solve the problems they have with their economy. It would be rather difficult to try to solve something Greece would blame solely on the Germans, now, wouldn't it?

Not only has there been no animosity between ""Greece"" and ""Germany"" as you would like it to seem, not only does the gov tolerate Germany's strict (and hypocritical, as outlined quite a few times already) austerity policy, which clearly does not seem to work, it has gone as far as to invite the German chancellor in friendly terms, and with honors (a military precision drill took place and the President of Democracy along with the PM discussed with Merkel).

As for your claims on ""the only country still arguing about this like mad"", this case has been on courts for decades right now, with some attempts at arrangements having been made, but mostly failed. And unlike the Polish Parliament, no resolution relevant to ""We conclude that  the German state owes as massive amouts of money in debt"" has been passed in recent years. 

I'd like to conclude by expressing the hope that this little gem of a paragraph has not been a hate-fueled delirium, but rather a desperate trolling attempt. If that is so, I must say that that was a good effort, though I'm a Cypriot who has lived for some years in Greece and Slovakia, so that doesn't really offend me personally.

&gt;the fact that you have not received the war reparations that you want, you seem to have lost sight of the fact that it was 70 years ago.

Source?
You still seem to be missing the fact that as I had remarked german war reparations amount to little over half a billion dollars, as opposed to the massive multi-billion loan taken from the Bank of Greece during WW2, but I'm sure that you'll ignore this again, too.

&gt;Why do you refuse to answer that? Why has Greece fucked up its finances so bad?

As I said, I will not repeat my arguments. And that is why I didn't (re)answer to your implication about the presence of a strong pro-fascist sentiment in modern Greece. I have already analyzed my views on the economic problems of Greece and about the +7% rise of the GD. You can read up on my posts as they are right there, I won't waste any more time re-analyzing my points unless a new argument is put forth.

Either way, whichever is the major contributing factor the state of Greek economics, it only serves your interest to further demonize the people themselves. It, in no way, removes Greece's or Poland's or whoever's right to receiving reparations and/or long-due, huge, loans.

&gt;despite having it much worse afterwards? 

I was unaware Estonia and Poland suffered a massive civil war waged between WW2 partisans and an Ally-sponsored government.

&gt;Why did you borrow so much money?

Oh, please get over yourself. :P

You do realize that that the whole reason of the 'bail-outs' is to get these countries back into the market so that they can take **more** loans to repay their older loans, and then continue taking even more loans to repay the new loans.

If your problem here is the reckless loaning, you might consider attacking the austerity-measures that have even more reckless loaning as their long-term goal.

PS: Nice assumption with the ""you"" btw. Clearly anyone who has something bad to say about the German gov or defend a fellow country in debt must be Greek. Keep on stereotypizin' :)

US infrastructure is not great, but it's not horrible. It was a hurricane. Short of sinking the powerlines underground(which we do many places) we were not going to be able to stop this. And the East coast is *not* an area generally hit by storms like this.

&gt;There's a difference between getting the facts, seeing what is happening and understanding why the people do it, let it be done to them, isn't it?

I understand what you're saying, but I adamantly believe he does not have his facts right. He has warped them utterly to fit into his preconception.

&gt;He is talking about cultural understanding. You guys used to be the spearhead of mass democracy, champions of public education, fighter for freedom. All that seems left is being capital's bitch. Why do you let that happen? Why do you keep falling for the nonsense of ""socialists"" ruining your country when the truth is staring into your face? A country bled by the rich and its military ventures.

It's the same conflict we've always had. Power of states vs power of national government, fermented and twisted over decades, fighting itself out in the subtext of nearly every issue we have on the national stage.

We made guarantees at the formation of our union to the southern states about the ability to leave and the power they would have. While I believe the civil war was a just war because of the overriding abomination of slavery, we broke those promises. They weren't allowed to leave and they weren't allowed to maintain power.

Our history ever since then is the urban areas trying to push their point of view on the rural areas, and the rural areas responding with a kind of all encompassing oppositional defiance to the point where even a good view when forced on them is perceived is bad. They lost the governmental war(for power, not the civil war) so what we're seeing now is the governmental equivalent of guerilla warfare. Scattered victories and obstruction won for short amounts of time. So now we have the worst of cases: A federal government with slightly tyrannical tendencies impeded at every corner and states too weak and underfunded to pick up the slack.

The only thing you really need to understand about political conflict in America is the civil war and the competing visions of what the country would be like. Capitalism and economic progress is one of the few things almost everyone agrees on now.

Europe is great if you want to be an employee and make a living that way. It's horrible if you want to *build something*. Employment laws in particular are made for large companies who can stomach losses, not nimble startups where a single employee may be 5-10% of your revenue. The taxation levels as well make growth very, very difficult. You can sustain yourself at a small/moderate size, but actually *growing* is hard.

It is not a coincidence that the US dominates the internet in many ways.

1) Taxes - When you're a 1-2 year old business being taxed at 50% means emptying your bank account by 50%. If you've been spending hard that year(the one not taxed yet) it can mean emptying out more than 50%. If you(for example) bought some technology that cost 25% of your bank account, then you get hit for 50% taxes on the previous year, you are removing *66.66%* of what remains in the account.

You need reserves to pay employees if things go badly, so this severely hampers your ability to expand. Also having a 25% VAT tax competing against companies that don't have VAT, and you have to lower prices by 25% just to be competing on an equal playing field with American companies.

2) Employment Law - Europe has strong employee protections that make sense for large businesses capable of absorbing losses. If you're a start-up on the brink, it's nothing but problems. For a start-up employees are a major part of your cost. Individual employees can be 5-10% of your revenue. Not being able to fire a bad hire for months(if at all) is absolutely catastrophic. 

Combine it with large mandated vacation days and restrictions on work hours(meaning you can't ""work until it's done"") and you have serious issues.

3) Investors - The above 2 things make investors run for the hills. Especially in places where there is a high capital gains tax, the reasons for investing quickly disappear. The whole advantage of startups is the potential for explosive growth and the ability to turn on a dime. The 2 things I mentioned earlier severely impede those advantages. Taking away the potential return for the investor and then removing the reasons he would invest in a startup in the first place means that it's much harder to get VC money. We survived without taking VC, but for many companies that's not possible.

-----------------------------------

Though all of this, it's important to realize one thing: Running a startup is really, really hard and most startups will fail. The ones that succeed will likely flirt with failure on more than one occasion. While the things I mentioned seem minor to others, combined they are more than enough to push a good start-up over the edge and into the abyss.

You're simplifying it significantly, but even on the rare occasions it is that way the entire process is expensive and bureaucratic.  Also even after 6 months, you absolutely need to be able to fire people without it costing tens of thousands of dollars. The [economist covers it in some depth](http://www.economist.com/node/21559618).

*The third big obstacle is labour law. If young firms are to survive near-terminal mistakes, or fluctuating demand, they need to be able to reduce staff costs quickly and cheaply when necessary. That is far harder in many European countries than elsewhere. The complexity and cost of firing people in Europe is a big concern for American venture capital, says Georges Karam, the chief executive of Sequans Communications*

[..]

*The cost of paying out large severance packages (six months of severance pay is typical even for very recent hires) can be a huge drain for a small company. “In San Francisco and in China, a communist country, I pay one to two months,” says a beleaguered French chief executive who does not want his name attached to such a sensitive subject. Big severance packages also make it much harder for start-ups to recruit the professional managers that can take them into the big league. Experienced executives are loth to forgo such reassuring goodies by resigning.*

[..]

*Anil de Mello, who started Mobuzz, a Spanish online-video firm, in 2005, watched his fledgling company implode with the onset of the financial crisis. He thought bankruptcy would give him a new start. But after business creditors were dealt with, Spanish social security pursued him for five more years to extract repayment of severance money it had paid to the firm’s employees on his behalf.*

Neither is Greece, nor is Poland, and generally anyone else in any position to actually realistically expect for the German gov to repay the reparations. How such a debt got written off is beyond me, honestly. The war reparations (which were only around $0.55 bn) could have have been arranged off by some treaty I'm unaware of, though the loan the German state took from the National Bank of Greece seems to be well-recorded.

As you say, due to the precedent that this would set, Germany couldn't pay back the reparations even if they wanted to-- the loans, etc should have been paid decades ago, before the interest and whatnot accumulated such a debt. Furthermore, it would set Germany and Europe as a whole back, really back, so it is also a bit problematic to require for the debt to be repaid instantly or in full, etc.

I think that the best thing that could happen for all sides involved would be some special arrangement; I believe that the Karamanlis Senior administration proposed that Germany gave a long-term loan with very low interest to Greece, though the arrangement wasn't settled (Not sure if it was the Karamanlis administration, I'll need to check that up). I'm not necessarilly proposing the same exact deal, but something similar could work. From a global perspective, I think that writting off huge debts is no better a precedent than  admitting to owing a huge bet yourself.

Either way, at this time, it would be more deontologically honest for the German government to be more lenient towards debt-ridden countries that it owes to, and I'm not necessarily talking just about the Eurozone here. And it works both ways. The countries that Germany owes to are/can be/could be lenient towards Germany, and Germany could be lenient towards countries that owe to its state.

It really is suprising to me that Germany would be probably the strictest and most pro-austerity measure member of the Eurozone, when it generally follows a very valid ""smart investment"" plan and has ""written-off"" quite a debt.

The Conservatives aren't anti-Europe, they're EU sceptical.  Widely different things.  The Conservatives have said numerous times that they're for staying in Europe.  They don't pretend Europe is bad for us, they actively argue that it is good.  What they argue is that Conservative direction in Europe, economic integration but no compromise on sovereignty and national identity, is the right one.  They get votes on Europe because they're seen as one of the parties that is not only willing to play hard ball but is capable of carrying through, whereas Labour has a reputation for being raped and with the LibDems the buggery would be consensual.  

They're hated for being vocal about their intention to get the best for Britain out of Europe, and not necessarily what's best for Europe.  No other country is any different.  Every one does which is best for their country first and Europe second.  When France and Germany break their own ERM rules and then tries to hold others accountable, they're out for themselves.  The Tories at least are honest about their intentions.

true,parigot,null,null,"Your friend's story sounds true. Occasionally people have sent me gifts from the States and thought it sounded better to put a higher price than the original gift cost. Once I had to pay more than $100 in customs for a package because my father described his gift on the customs slip as ""antique glasses"" worth $75-- which was a cheap set of 12 tall massmade glasses from Sears or somewhere. (Hard to find tall glasses in France.) 

The thing is to make sure you put the value as less that $20 (the less the better) and say it's a gift. Don't package it as something valuable. It doesn't matter what the real value is and you can put whatever you like without having any liability because the sending country doesn't care what you write. 

The problem is, as far as I can see, that customs agents think everyone is cheating, so if you put $50 as the value of the package, they assume it's really worth hundreds and charge accordingly. Once they decide how much customs to charge-- and they don't usually even open the package, I've never had one opened-- the recipient has only the choice of paying the duty or returning the package unopened. 

For things like CDs or money, I put them in a cheap paperback book to mail them and write $1 or so on the outside. ",0,1352233041,null,0,1352233417,0,c6xecgi,t3_12i6zy,t1_c6xecgi,t3_12i6zy,null,1430337162,1,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,1

UKIP argues for a Swiss style trade agreement.  What you describe is on the cards because they're grown ups, it's none of this school yard 'if you don't want to be in our gang we're not going to play with you again' nonsense.  UK and European companies will still want to trade with each other.  I find the whole notion of a punitive Europe if the UK leaves the Union childish and contemptible.  It's on the cards because it's still a best fit win-win solution for everybody concerned.

As for the matter of 'being offered' as if scraps swept off the table.  They're not in a position to not offer it, and it'd be the same if any of the larger countries were to leave.  You don't take a multiple trillion euro economy's trade out of Europe and for everyone not to hurt - so the simple solution is if the UK chooses, as it is well in its rights to do and Europe can't do anything about that, any exit solution is one that allows British trade and Britain can set its own requirements and expectations just as other countries traditionally have.

&gt;If there was a choice of UK stays in EU (status quo), or UK leaving EU and common market and free trade, what would you want?

a) There is no status quo, as Ireland should know all to well given its referendum history, as should most of Europe but especially France and the Netherlands.  The Lisbon Treaty is suspiciously identical in what it delivers to the Constitution they rejected.  It was just a way to circumvent their referendum laws.  It's a freight train that is constantly moving in different directions and no one country is in control.  Hell, without looking it up I seriously doubt that most people know who Viv Reding is.  There's no accountability when people don't even know who their Vice President and Commissioner for Justice is.

b)  Given the two options of staying in a derailing train or getting out at the previous station, leaving the common market, I am most decidedly on the train platform and looking for a taxi.  If they're insistent that the only way forward for Europe is going down federalism they are recreating the same conditions of early Yugoslavia, and there's absolutely nothing stopping the UK from entering a trade agreement and getting out.  Trading with Europe would just be like trading with any other country, or how every other country in the world outside Europe trades with it.

But the idea of Britain not being able to negotiate its own European solution is specious.  Norway can have a Norwegian solution, and Switzerland could manage a Swiss solution but the UK couldn't manage a UK solution?  Don't buy it. 

 Let's not forget too that Ol' Blighty has what must be a terribly annoying habit, if you're European, of being absolutely right when it comes to the direction Europe should move in.

I'm currently studying abroad in Madrid (a media studies major... not theatre but still, I'm interested in art as well) and one of my larger problems here has been finding ""new"" and ""exciting"" art. Not to get too historical, but not toooooo much new stuff was produced when Franco was in power, and things aren't nearly as vibrant or progressive (for the most part) as say, Berlin or London. 

However, there is stuff! As for my personal input, the Reina Sofia (a big place, I know) is AWESOME and has some super fantastic new art. I've been to plenty of museums large and small here, and the Reina's collection is out of this world. Even if you don't care for Dali or Picasso, they have plenty of new, experimental art AND video that will impress you for hours on end. 

I am going to be lazy and copy/paste an email response to a question about contemporary art spaces that my boyfriend's uncle was kind enough to send us about contemporary art here in madrid. His work is along the graphic designy end of things, but I can wholeheartedly recommend all he said here. Hope my info and this email helps, I can try to answer other questions, but come to Madrid it's fabulous!

Dude, believe me, multipliers aren't something you can pull out of your arse. Sure, they're there, but they don't work like that.

While your reasoning is accurate, do keep in mind that there are no free lunches. While cutting public spending has negative effects in the GDP, the taxation required for the public spending in the first place also has negative effects in the product.

The solution to the public debt problem can come from reduced public spending or the same public spending but with a stronger economy. And, with regards to Greece, the economy growing soon is improbable considering that their state is broke and it's currently a very unattractive place to invest in, that's why they're first cutting spending and only later worrying with the growth of the economy - because while cutting spending is sure to reduce the public debt, increased government spending stimulating the economy is much more uncertain.",0,1352241543,null,0,false,0,c6xgzoc,t3_12pddz,t1_c6xgzoc,t1_c6x6jrz,null,1430338461,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

As for the taxes, they will not be lowered at all with or without these measures. If anything, with these measures, they will probably have to rise to compensate the loss in revenues from the total freeze in economic activity that comes when all your population expects things to get worse and worse.  
  
To me this is simple math, a multiplier bigger than 1 shows austerity is self defeating, while a multiplier smaller than 1 would show it works, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something as this is not my field.

true,h2orat,null,null,"I've made a few posts about this before, I'll share below the comments, but I wish to provide some additional information here.  There are several good locations within the Paris city limits that would be able to accommodate you within the budget range mentioned above.  Additionally, there are several agencies within Paris that can assist you.  I would recommend going through an agency because they'll be able to assist and vouch for your financial ability.  Landlords in Paris can be equated to Employers with a job opening.  There are dozens of applicants and the landlords have their pick of the litter.  However, your ability to prove a stable income to pay for rent will help in terms of how they view you.  The ability to also show an employment contract and pay stubs for the prior months will also help.  These are things that the agencies will ask for you to provide to assist in your relocation.

In terms of what you have found so far, I wish to dispel some misconceptions you may have (I had these as well before going over).  What you have found so far in terms of things being overpriced or worn down furniture is how housing in Paris is; especially if it is an apartment that is rented frequently.  IKEA and other cheap furniture options are used greatly because of the wear and tear.  Additionally, the demand for housing in Paris is extremely high.  So Landlords are able to charge higher rates for very small apartments based on the location.  I have seen apartments that are the size of standard US bathrooms that were for 1000 Euros/month.  Additionally, I have seen apartments three times the size of the previously mentioned apartment for 650 Euros/month, because of the differences in location and the cheaper apartment was also on the 8th floor with no elevator.  There are still several great locations within Paris at a good price, but when you find them, you have to take them immediately, because at least 20 other people are also looking at it. If anything, I would strongly suggest looking for people you know with contacts in Paris who can ask around to their friends and networks to find if anyone has something available.  This is often better than any other way.

Again, I promised to provide what I have posted in the past and I hope all this helps:

&gt;I made a post about something similar to this a while back. Below is the link for that thread as several people had good ideas on there as well.
&gt;
&gt;[lk2009 looking for Fall Semester apartment](http://www.reddit.com/r/paris/comments/tpdbv/hi_rparis_ill_need_somewhere_to_stay_from_august/)
&gt;
&gt;If you are a student, your school should have some viable options for you to stay in. Whether it is dorm-style apartments or living with families. There are several organizations in Paris that can help you find a family to live with, but I have no experience with any of them.

&gt;Here is my original comment which should still apply here:

&gt;Finding an apartment in Paris can be very difficult. Unless you know someone already here that can hook you up, I can recommend a few places for you. Also, understand that finding housing on a short term lease (Less than 12 months) can also decrease your chances.

&gt;First, if the university you are going through provides you with options, I recommend taking one of them. Makes things infinitely simpler as the school has done the majority of the work.

&gt;Second, there are several agencies within Paris that you can go through for housing; understand that you'll have to pay a fee which can add up to one month worth of rent. Here are a few options: [Lodgis.com](http://www.lodgis.com/), [SeLoger.com](http://www.seloger.com/), and I'm sure you can find others via the internet.

&gt;Third, I have heard a few people have success with Craigslist in Paris, but I have also heard more stories about people being scammed. Just use the same kind of sense that you would use when dealing with a long lost Nigerian relative. It's worth an effort, but generally for self-listed apartments, they require your physical presence to meet you in person. Another website, like Craigslist, that people use is [PAP.fr](http://www.PAP.fr). It is more reliable than Craisglist, but scams are still possible.

&gt;Finally, I found my first location in Paris through [SabbaticalHomes.com](http://www.sabbaticalhomes.com/). Very reliable, but some of the locations on this site can be very expensive. Mainly because they are more for vacation rentals.

&gt;I would recommend researching all your options, but understand that with the second and third options you will have to have a lot more information upfront to give to the landlord. Most of the legal rights in France reside with the person renting the apartment, not the landlord. Therefore, landlords are a lot more ""picky"" when it comes to who they rent out apartments to. I had to provide a CV, bank documents, proof of income (if not possible, guarantee of funds via letter from family, plus their bank statement), recommendations from previous landlords, and basically anything else that would make me look like a good tenant short of a blood test. This can be a bit daunting, but in reality it is no different than looking for a job.

&gt;Price depends on where you get situated. The more central you are in Paris, the higher the price and smaller the location. Sometimes you'll find a nice price for a place within Paris, but then realize that it is on the 8th floor with no elevator, or does not have bathroom included with the room (communal bath in hallway). If you take the time you should be able to find something nice, otherwise, I recommend going through an agency or your school and leave it up to them. if possible, take a trip out here early so you can spend a few days looking at what is provided.

&gt;Good luck.",0,1352244392,null,0,1352245013,0,c6xhuc3,t3_12qv02,t1_c6xhuc3,t3_12qv02,null,1430338843,1,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,1

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;I didn't pull the multiplier out of my arse, I based it on the interval between 0.9 and 1.7 given by the IMF not long ago. 

Yet even them IMF said that they miscalculated its effects. These multipliers make absolute sense in macroeconomics but accurately predicting them in real life, that's can be an issue. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's econometrics, and it's very difficult to accurately predict because of the sheer number of exogenous variables that simply can't be predicted in the models.

Heck, even a multiplier of 0.9 is nothing like a multiplier of 1.7, that variation is immense, that's an huge error margin.

&gt;As for the taxes, they will not be lowered at all with or without these measures.

Yep, you're most probably right. Which is unfortunate, cutting spending but also increasing the tax rates in order to downsize the size of the government is counter-productive. Sure, in the short-term, it does increase it's revenue, but on the long run, it makes the economy much more uncompetitive, and the worse an economy performs, the less a government can tax.

&gt; If anything, with these measures, they will probably have to rise to compensate the loss in revenues from the total freeze in economic activity that comes when all your population expects things to get worse and worse.

Again, you're right, but if the alternative of cutting spending is spending, that's also not viable, it was spending that got them in this situation in the first place. The problem of the 'government should spend to expand the economy' in this situation is quite simple, the government is already buried in debt and nothing guarantees an increase in spending will generate growth (not only this wasn't happening in the past as a lot of that spending went to waste, now the situation in Greece is quite volatile and you can very well be in a liquidity trap).

It's all about mix between tax rates, GDP and public spending. If you can't cut public spending, you can't raise public spending and the economy won't grow no matter what, the public debt problem will never be fixed.

&gt;To me this is simple math, a multiplier bigger than 1 shows austerity is self defeating, while a multiplier smaller than 1 would show it works, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something as this is not my field. 

I'm also no expert in this, trust me, but with regards to the multipliers of public spending, you also have to consider the opportunity cost which is to not tax the income the state is spending in the first place. Even if there was a multiplier of 5 by every € the state injected in the economy, if there was the alternative of not taxing in the first place (which in itself would avoid a negative multiplier but this is simply and example) and the multiplier of the private sector was of 6€ by every extra € it kept, this would be a situation where even though the multiplier is great at first glance, it's actual inefficient when compared to the best alternative which in this example was to not tax in the first place.",0,1352245169,null,0,false,0,c6xi2gu,t3_12pddz,t1_c6xi2gu,t1_c6xh9az,null,1430338960,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Exactly, Greece consistently had a much much bigger multiplier with austerity than expected, hence the miscalculation and why the new estimate is so high. This is, again, the reason why this specific strategy is not only bad, it is particularly bad for Greece. 

Alternatively, one could say Greece's public spending multiplier was insignificant. That while austerity and reducing spending is now harming the economy, the runaway public debt they got in the first place didn't provide the economic growth it should, not by a long shot.

Nobody is saying that austerity doesn't have a direct negative impact in the GDP, the problem is that not-austerity (aka spending) was the root of the actual problem in the first place, that while the best thing would be for there to not be a need for austerity, that the public debt mandated it and that its alternative will have much more severe consequences (and, again, was there a control in the public spending in the first place, austerity wouldn't now be required).

&gt;Greece needs to either default and exit the Euro immediately or actually get helped by the Eurozone instead of ""helped"" in the form of ""bailouts"". The longer they stay in this course the worse any outcome will be for them.

A default and exit of the euro? That's insanity, that would be the coup de grâce for them! They're not dead yet, don't try to contain them and throw them under the bus!

Not only would them be in a much worse situation that they're in now, we'd also suffer directly from it. All the European economies are interconnected, you really don't want a domino effect now.

&gt; or actually get helped by the Eurozone instead of ""helped"" in the form of ""bailouts"".

There's political reasons behind this. You're right, a simple ""you're forgiven of your debt"" would end this but what's preventing this from happening again? The structural changes need to happen, there needs to be barriers against the runaway public deficits, that's the main goal of these interventions - not to raise the GDP, not to preserve the life quality, no - simply to prevent this spiral of events that happen when the spending is excessive and it's weight on the rest of the economy just proves too much.

This is more complicated than it sounds, on the one hand, the average Greek doesn't any blame in the situation he's in and he's the one that has to pay for it, on the other hand, the average not-Greek also isn't to blame for any of this and shouldn't be expected to continue to pay for Greece's mismanagements.",0,1352248135,null,0,false,0,c6xiu5r,t3_12pddz,t1_c6xiu5r,t1_c6xielf,null,1430339308,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The alternative (our strategy) they have is, even after seeing they are getting fucked in the ass to push forward and keep doing what is asked in the hopes that a bone will be thrown their way in the end. There are no guarantees that will happen.  
  
Europe wouldn't even need to forgive anything, they would just need to seriously lower the interest rate on the loans it does to them since their budget is already pretty much balanced if you exclude interest payments. This way everyone gets paid. And all you need is to force Greece to agree to keep the budget as balanced as it is now, no more austerity is necessary.

Seriously though, the thing that gets me about those tiresome turds is that I am convinced many if them actually believe that they are doing the right thing.  I once had a (very civil) email exchange with the head of digital copyright enforcement at EMI or some other music firm after my girlfriend had bought some DRMed Grönemeyer CD (which took me all of about 3 minutes to strip of the DRM so she could put it on her music player). 

I informed them (very politely) that I did not approve of the implication that I was not to be trusted after having legitimately purchased their product, that providing a crippled item without clearly labeling it is not a good way to make friends of your valued customers, and that treating me like a potential pirate just meant that the next time I was feeling inclined to consume their artist's fine creations, I would be far more likely to not bother proving them wrong instead of paying money to people who assume their consumers are basically crooks. 

He genuinely did not get it. The implied insult and pointlessness in DRMing a disc someone was BUYING with a ""protection"" that is a joke to anyone with half a clue, and whose only purpose seemed to be to possible off every single German music forum in existence, just escaped the poor man - who was very polite and otherwise apparently quite reasonable and intelligent.

Er jobbte z.b. gern mal beim Film als Extra und kriegte da immer nur die Rollen als Drogendealer, Kleinkrimineller, etc.

Am demütigendsten sei es gewesen, dass abends in NY weisse Frauen oft die Bürgersteigseite wechselten, wenn er ihnen entgegenkam. Weil sie wohl das Vorurteil hatten, dass Leute wie er eben nur böses im Sinn hätten. Sowas würde in Berlin eigentlich nie vorkommen.

Ich denke, bei ihm war es auch die Lebenssituation: Er war in Berlin in einer guten Beziehung mit einer Berlinerin, total verliebt. Das hilft bei vielem. ;-)

* Britain is talking about the raw budget spent by the EU.

* The EC is talking about the budget as a percentage of GNI or income. GNI has gone up because Bulgaria and Romania joined after the settlement was made for the 2007-2013 budget. And Croatia is due to join within the 2014-2020 budget period.

Both sides have reasonable points. The former definition is most relevant to country contributions, because the increased budget will have to be met by the existing net contributors, rather than any of the new accession states, who will be net beneficiaries. The latter definition is most relevant to the EC, because it is trying to maintain its current level of service and investment provision.

Personally, I'm disappointed that this has to be a numbers game. I'd much rather we were trying to alter the budget so that it is properly audited, and so that more money is spent on useful programmes. That primarily means cutting the CAP, and transferring the cash to infrastructure and research investment, although admittedly this would be impossible anyway, given the French veto threat. But this is a good example of how poor Britain is at diplomacy within Europe.

Also our economies are so deeply intertwined that we can't just overlooked the gigantic fuckups in regulating wall street. Don't get me wrong we are not doing much better over here in that regard but a clear signal from the US would be more than welcome. Call it leadership if you like.

The potential problems that I can think of come into play when you consider other countries, not just Greece by itself. If you give Greece such a deal -- further debt reduction and all the bailout money at a time -- then you need to give a similar deal to the other GIIPS. I'm not sure if all Eurozone members can currently get that kind of cash, which after all they have to borrow themselves, and it's questionable whether banks everywhere could take the hit of a substantial debt cut for the larger Southern economies.

I also have doubts about any Greek government managing reforms of the labor market and the bureaucracy that are actually necessary without the next tranche as leverage (or, depending on how you look at it, the Troika as a political scapegoat), quite frankly.

Another reason is that when states start making investments into other states, then very soon everything will become politicized. Lets say that the EU decides to build some solar power to North Africa, the first in-fight will be between states to make sure that they get their fare share on contracts, the second fights brakes sooner or later with the builders and the host country, ranging from ever changing requirements to bureaucracy interrupting the whole business. And every time after a fight, politicians will come and save the project with the European taxpayers money.

How about this... If the Northern African countries want investment, then they need to start promote such things as rule of law, safety of conducting business, etc... and then when things are competitive enough, private investors will come and will invest. Let the market do what it knows best, after all it wasn't foreign states that invested to China, it was private companies.

P.S. Another thing that people forget when they speak about investing into Northern Africa. If you invest huge amounts of money somewhere, and if that something has any strategic value, then you better have the capability of securing that investment.

*However*, the European Commission says ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/creating-opportunities/bilateral-relations/countries/norway/ ) EU → Norway trade is €43bil, €91bil the other way, and for Switzerland ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/creating-opportunities/bilateral-relations/countries/switzerland/ ) it's €47bil &amp; €67bil. *(I may have got these numbers the wrong way around, but the point still stands)*

&gt;Les turques ne sont pas des arabes. Tu veux peut-être dire musulman? Dans ce cas c'est pas évident, si on compte la Bosnie par exemple.

non, c'est juste une erreur de ma part (ca m'aprendras a poster a des heures indus). ce que je voulais vraiment dire c'est ""les turc sont les plus laic parmis cet ensemble qui regroupe magreb, peninsule arabique, moyen orient  et les pay qui finissent en ""an"" "". je ne sais pas si  il y a un mot pour designer cette region, si quelqu'un a une proposition, je suis preneur.

true,WhyNeptune,WALE,Wales,"On the ""do you think homosexual behaviour is natural"" I answered no. The reason for this was I believe that everyone has a choice and not only is it not predetermined, it may necessarily not be permanent and can be subject to change; so I was surprised by the amount of people that put yes.

I'm wondering whether in this I am a minority or if we thought of the question differently. Hopefully someone follows up


**Edit : This is an edit due to a reply a month after this was written so I thought I should try and explain the view point that I had better.**


Wow, that thread was from awhile ago lol. I didn't come across as I wanted there, what I meant was that I do not believe in the argument:

""God made me this way"" or the similar ""I was born this way""

The reason I do not like that argument is that I feel as if the people using it as making excuses. Rather than say I want this for myself or I like it, they say I was made this way in one fashion or another, and that they had no decision whatsoever.

The other argument is that perhaps they are slightly true which I didn't really address or think of when I wrote that is that we can only rarely control which chemicals fire in our brain in response to which stimuli.But these do change, whether it is the love of an individual or the love of an activity. I just find it hard to believe that, for example, every man that has ever walked down the wedding isle to marry a women and later decided that they enjoyed men were to put it bluntly, lying through their teeth and their whole life prior to the act of loving a man was a lie. Instead of simply that they changed as we all do.

I used the word natural in the wrong context for as someone rightly said, as well as yourself, anything within the animal kingdom is natural.

Anyway, this is sort of what I meant when I wrote that I did not believe that either homosexualness (word? or is it simply homosexuality) or heterosexualness was predetermined and was not subject to change. As if everything was final, and that is that. But you are right, the behaviour is certainly natural.

I hope I've explained myself better and don't sound pedantic about the subject. Reply even if I hopefully don't so I can see your thoughts on that matter.",0,1352307039,null,0,1357415640,0,c6xtxep,t3_12sw8g,t1_c6xtxep,t3_12sw8g,null,1430344651,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Interviews are different from campaign speeches. The latter are scripted by professional speech writers and aimed at undecided voters among a few selected demographics in swing states. I've watched the election on NBC and found it remarkable how they emphasized that Obama was said to have had a hand in writing his acceptance speech. US presidential campaigns could hardly be distinguished from marketing campaigns for a product that has been tailored for a target demographics if it wasn't for the vastly larger budget.  
Communication isn't just about what you say, but also what you don't say. By letting the candidates set the agenda themselves they can pick the topics they like and avoid those they don't. Clint Eastwood talking to the chair was almost like a metaphor for this. In an interview, on the other hand, a journalist can ask questions directly, at least if the interview is of the proper kind where questions aren't pre-approved, and the journalist isn't selected for her or his friendliness towards the candidate and able to actually ask proper questions without fear of alienating such a great ""get"" for future interviews by their respective network.  
An extreme example was Palin last time around. Without the few interviews she had given early on, the public might have never learned about her staggering ignorance, because her speech writers actually know their stuff and she at least is able to read. 

Of course, this doesn't really answer the question why he would give interviews, it just raises the question why he was able to get away with not giving any.

The poverty limit for a single person is €550/month, and minimum wage is €590. What you're hearing about supposedly troika-sanctioned labour reforms is an attempt by some Greek industries to influence troika, in order to drive salaries below the poverty limit. These industries owe the state hundreds of millions of Euros in unpaid taxes and social security contributions. Also, they want to create Exclusive Economic Zones where they will be able to take advantage of the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, by paying them half of the minimum wage.

Obviously the candidates are being cast in a light that the campaign managers, party strategists, and speech writers believe would appeal to both the base of the party and enough of the masses to win an election, but the importance of these entities I believe is overstated.

If that were entirely true, then the candidate would not matter at all, they would simply be a body in a suit acting out a script. I feel the candidates have more say in what the message of a speech should convey, that there must be feedback between the speech giver, and the speech writer. Otherwise situations could arise where the speech does not reflect the speakers views, so it would therefore be corrected.

This is highly misleading.
While they don't prosecute the possession they charge you with a DUI if you have THC-COOH, the product THC degrades into and which is not psychoactive, in your blood and drive. They usual urine tests also only looks for THC-COOH while alternatives that check whether you're under the influence at the moment do exist but are not used.

So if they catch you while driving you're looking at either a Drunkenheitsfahrt + Aufbauseminare (1-1.5k€) and a few months Fahrverbot up to a Drunkenheitsfahrt + MPU (around 2k€ upwards) and Fahrverbot until you pass your MPU.
Especially for people in their 20s-30s that are dependent on their car for work this can mean a serious dent for their professional career, so I'd say we are a far cry from legalization.

It also helps prohibition that it got dropped of from every party's agenda as soon as they got into power, the FDP for example used to be pro-legalization (while they now hold the office of Drogenbeauftragte with Mechthild Dyckman who has simply no clue about the realities of drugs and especially drugs in Germany), as were the Greens who dropped the issue when they formed coalitions.

Of course the candidate still matters, after all this is about a pretty powerful office. That's why it's so important that people actually know what they'll get.

true,doogood,null,null,"Hey there!

I've recently put together a list of some of my favorite restaurants (with descriptions) in Madrid for a friend who just visited. If you have any specific questions about other foods (I don't go to bars much, but do love food) or museums, I am an art student studying abroad here and can recommend some good sites, just let me know. But here are a few restaurants- pick and choose and I can vouch for any!

1) [SALVADOR](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2034008-Reviews-Restaurante_Casa_Salvador-Madrid.html)
This old Hemingway favourite is typical of many Madrid classics – walking past, you wouldn’t give it a second look. Since 1941, locals have been coming to the ‘Saviour’ for lashings of hearty Madrid cooking, and among them are plenty of bullfighting aficionados and toreros (bullfighters, or matadors), especially during the Fiestas de San Isidro Labrador. Ordering a plate of rabo de torois a way to win friends, while the remainder is simple, no-nonsense fare.

2.) [LA CASA DEL ABUELO](http://www.lacasadelabuelo.es/)
In Huertas, La Casa del Abuelo is famous for gambasa la plancha (grilled prawns) or gambas al ajillo (prawns sizzling in garlic on little ceramic plates) and a chato (small glass) of the heavy, sweet El Abuelo red wine; they cook over 200kg of prawns here on a good day.
 
3.) [MOMO](http://11870.com/pro/momo)
Momo is a Chueca beacon of reasonably priced home-cooking for a casual but stylish crowd. It’s got an artsy vibe and is ideal for those who want a hearty meal without too much elaboration. The menú del día (fixed-price three-course meal) is one of Madrid’s bargains and the famous chocolate moco (snot) is the tastiest of dessert dishes despite its worrying name.

4.) [CON DOS FOGONES](http://www.condosfogones.com/)
There are few cities in western Europe where you can get a ten-euro three-course meal as good as this. The Dominican chef conjures up a variety of traditional Spanish food and new takes on classic international cuisine. And eating so cheaply doesn't mean eating in a spit-and-sawdust locale either - this restaurant looks as good as its food is great.

5.) [CASA GRANADA](http://www.notesfrommadrid.com/2007/01/23/shhh-dont-tell-anyone-else-about-casa-de-granada/)
Casa Granada is the best hidden bar in Madrid. Even when people are told the exact location they still can't find it.
Unfortunately, the excellent drink + tapa offers have disappeared as the bar tries to milk its location for all its worth. But it's still a great location for a drink.
Where is Casa Granada?
At C/ Doctor Cortezo 17. Walking down the road between the Teatro Häagen-Dazs Calderón and the movie theater (which also happens to show movies in English), you'll see this buzzer (above) on the left-hand side. Press it and you'll hear a bell. Go through the door and take the elevator to the top floor. Voila!
 
6.) [LA SANABRESA](http://www.restaurantelasanabresa.com/index.html)
You can’t wrong with their wonderful baked lamb and chicken, and their menu del dia starts at 10 euros for lunch and dinner.  It was written in the New York Times a few years ago as being a “French Bistro, Spanish style.”  Also make sure you sit in Joaquin’s section up front. (big mustache waiter)  If you go for dinner get there at 8pm when they open, otherwise a line forms out the door by 9pm, and they are closed on Sundays, and some Mondays.
 
7.) [MACEIRAS](https://plus.google.com/105356590714269119068/about?gl=US&amp;hl=en) ****highly recommended****
Galician tapas (think octopus, green peppers etc) never tasted so good as in this agreeably rustic bar down the bottom of the Huertas hill, especially when washed down with a crisp white Ribeiro. The simple wooden tables, loyal customers and handy location make for a fine atmosphere. There’s another branch around the corner at Calle de Jesús 7, which keeps the same hours.
•  Price: meals €20-30
 Hours 8.30pm-12.45am Tue, 1.15-4.15pm &amp; 8.30pm-12.45am Wed, Thu, Sun &amp; Mon, until 1.15am Fri &amp; Sat
 

And here's some various info for good measure...... 

Plaza Mayor
One cannot visit Madrid without trying the famous and traditional “Bocadillo de Calamar” (fried cuttlefish roll) at the restaurants in Plaza Mayor offering the best quality and outdoor eating at between €3.50 and €5 depending on whether you sit down or opt to eat on the move

If you wish to try tapas on a budget then I recommend La Latina and Alonso Martinez as the “cheap and plentiful” neighbourhoods where the tapas is of a good quality and not simply a couple of olives or stale chips on a plate. Another option is the chain 100 Montaditos where you choose from over a hundred different tapas and eat your fill for €7-8 at various locations around town.

Gran Via, literally “big street”, is home to exclusive corporate addresses, the major theatres and upmarket stores. What isn’t often mentioned is that by taking any of the numerous streets leading off this thoroughfare one can find countless restaurants and cafeterias offering very very economical eating. The majority of these restaurants are either family run or independent speciality establishments such as Asian or Chinese cuisine and a meal “a la carte” comes in at no more than €15. For dining out in Madrid there’s no cheaper alternative for a sit down meal.

Brazil is a massive country which is making great progress. They are not culturally far from us and if we work together we can become closer. Mexico has its drug war, yet is still doing very well.

true,ajuc,POLA,Poland,"I don't see how it's so obvious. First of all we talk about overall effect - if some companies and artists are hurt, while some other benefit, the overall effect can be anything, you need to define how we average this (I suggest sum of (square of the change of profits times the sign of this change)). Then we need to calculate this (and it's hard cause we deal with ""what if"" scenarios).

There were companies that benefited from piracy (I'd say Microsoft, Adobe and Corel are among them - they got their marketshare thanks to piracy, and people trained to use their apps buy licences when they go proffesional, start a company, etc). If people had to pay for every app and game they use - they would search for free alternatives (like GIMP instead of Photoshop, Linux instead of Windows, Libre Office instead of Microsoft Office, etc). And when you know one application going to another is a barrier.

Another thing is - piracy makes you much more recognizable. There is a point in the development of game studio, when the advantage of more potential customers is greater than the lost profit. There were studies that shown that pirates are the people that are the most probable to buy music/games/etc. If they feel your game deserves the pay - many will pay. See the McPixel gmae to see how smart developers benefit from their games being pirated. There's no way its developer could get that media coverage and got to so many people without piracy.

For now we have:
 - outrageus claims of damages from publishers (counting everybody pirating the game as lost profit - that's the wrong way to count this - no way people would buy all the games they pirate)
 - studies showing that piracy can be good for at least some companies
 - anegdotic evidence of companies benefiting from piracy

I think it isn't obvious who is right.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"&gt;You still haven't given me a source for that is how the wine money is spent. Give me a source please. I'd since that would be very relevant since you are saying that 2% of the EU budget is going to environmental adjustement of wine yards.

Because there are only two major things that the CAP budget can be spent on really when it comes to farming; income support for farmers to ensure that in years of low market prices due to international factors they don't go bankrupt, and for environmental sustainability. I can't give you a source because it's not as simple as looking at a source, it's in essence the entirety of the CAP.

&gt;It is not justified to the level that we are subsidising, and it is not an argument that it can't be done on a national level. Are you claiming that we need to subsidise it with €3/day to stabilise them? I do not think we need to pay that amount of money

The amount of money that goes into the CAP is the amount it needs to ensure agricultural worker income stability, food price stability, food security and environmental sustainability. 

&gt;I sent you the Eurostat report. I object to around 40 % of the EU budget is going to CAP. I think it could be done better on a national level, and less corrupt. Also, I do not think the farmers need that much.

You know where percentages of the CAP go to, you haven't demonstrated any knowledge of knowing the criteria for why it's spent the way it is. All you seem to know is 'this percentage goes here', and not WHY. Until you know WHY, I think it's ridiculous for you to criticize it.

&gt;Also, you haven't addressed the fact that the EU is harming 3rd world farmers with it subsidies.

I already said that I know that it's harming third world farmers with it's subsidies elsewhere, but that's a silly point. We live in a realist dominated international world. The EUs CAP can at least to a high degree ensure that the food we get doesn't significantly harm the environment, which can't be also said for third world countries.

&gt;Of course. Link[1] . Another Link[2] . They mention the corruption that you do not believe exist either, but really, I can just throw link after link at you about the corruption in the EU. Here are some:
Link[3] . Here is my favourite, a minister's daughter, a Swedish accordian club etc. This is when investigating journalism actually checked where the money was going........
Link 1[4] .
Link 2[5] - here it is also mentioned that some countries (willfully I suppose because it is not really hard) don't release the numbers in accessible ways.
Link 3[6] . This is actually an article of EU dealing with it, but the numbers they get back are very small, I just thought I wanted to prove that it was officially recognised byt the EU that it is corruption, since you do seem to believe that.

Those kinds of errors turn up in any kind of government funded project, it's silly to single out just the CAP for that happening.

&gt;So, how do you suggest dealing with the corruption? Do you think it is wise keeping something that is obvious corrupt? It haven't been dealt with in the last 16 years, so it is not like one can say that the EU is working on it 

http://ec.europa.eu/budget/explained/myths/myths_en.cfm#4of15

&gt;For example, since northern Europe will be getting more and more rain (I study environmental science) it is strange that 2 % of the whole EU budget should go to how to deal with arid areas in wine yards (which you claim), but not a lot on how to deal with the more rains we will get.

FFS, how many times do I have to explain this to you? That was an example of what it goes on, once there is a need to address environmental sustainability with regards to higher levels of rain due to global warming the CAP will address that as well.",0,1352329479,null,0,1352330134,0,c6y0j5t,t3_12lkq7,t1_c6y0j5t,t1_c6w8wmf,null,1430347798,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

You can understand from this how people who join the force, and many of them are very young people, many of them from the countryside, simple folk kids and workers, even if they are not racist or have a tendency for violence and abuse of authority, are forced by this established circle in the police force to actually become abusive and racist. If that's your everyday social circle that's what you will eventually become.

Second, *if* what you claim was true, which you seem so reluctant to proveI do not still how spending 2 % on the water issues of wine is defenseble. First, wine is a small, and certainly not important as food, so it would be wiser to spend it on the watering of wheat, potatoes or something similar. Second, as I am sure you know, the climate changes will lead to too much water in a lot of areas, and just spending 2 % on the watering of wine is certainly irresponsible, when the whole of northern Europe, will be wetter. We need to learn how to deal with to much water. How will that affect the forrests in northern Europe_

Second, you never ever proved to me that spending 44 % of the EU budget on CAP is better, than having it on a national leverl. Links, please. You never proved or, even argued against the corruption that is so rampant(are you saying that it is not, or that they are dealing with it), the fact that the budget have been OK'd in ages, or the fact that there might be a lot of government out there who is a lot more sound and healthy, than the EU. Are you saying that government Reinfeld is more corrupt for example, or Germany's government.

You also never proved why the subsidies have to be so big. Even if we have them, 44 % of the budget, links for that please.

So, why don't you give me the links, I for example honestly do not understand why the watering of wine (as you claim),is so important that one have to spend 2% of the budget on it, while simoulataneously cutting down on education, research and development.

I'm contributing more data, analysed on a much larger scale. I will also share some observations. The results are not as clear-cut as they might seem.

First, some background information for those not familiar with the subject.

According to Article 27 of [Presidential Decree 26/2012](http://et.diavgeia.gov.gr/f/min-interior/ada/%CE%9244%CE%91%CE%9D-%CE%A0%CE%A5%CE%A3) (PDF, in Greek), military personnel and members of the Security Forces (Police, Special Guards, Coast Guard, Fire Service) vote in designated polling stations near their departments' premises, along with other citizens, with their names on special lists and by showing their special IDs. They are also able to vote in polling stations in their local authorities (where they live or where their parents registered them when they were born), since their names are already on the electoral roll, as it happens with all citizens on the day they turn 18. In order for them to do that, they have to file applications with their departments. If they are granted a leave, their names are taken off the aforementioned special lists.

[Hellenic Police](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_Police) has 55.000 members and two main branches in Greece, one in Athens and one in the northern city of [Thessaloniki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki) (Greece's Second City), dividing the country in two. The [General Police Directorate of Attica](http://wikimapia.org/1007449/Police-headquarters) has its seat in the [7th Municipal District](http://wikimapia.org/10382644/7th-Municipal-District-of-Athens) ([population estimate 160.000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens#Athens_Municipality)) of the City of Athens, and the [General Police Directorate of Thessaloniki](http://wikimapia.org/1471951/Police-Headquarters) has its seat in the [Municipality of Kordelio-Evosmos](http://wikimapia.org/14548826/Municipality-of-Kordelio-Evosmos) ([population estimate 75.000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kordelio-Evosmos)).

Let's start with last May's elections in Athens.

There are 107 citizens-only and 44 mixed polling stations for citizens and members of the Special Forces, in the 7th Municipal District, the seat of Athens Police HQ. We are able to know this by examining [the list provided by the Ministry of Interior](http://www.ypes.gr/UserFiles/f0ff9297-f516-40ff-a70e-eca84e2ec9b9/TMHMATA_INTERNET_20120427_1213.xls) (XLS, in Greek, the number of voters in the electoral roll shows up in the 4th column) and the total number of registered voters showing up in the [final results](http://ekloges-prev.singularlogic.eu/v2012a/public/index.html?lang=en#{""cls"":""level"",""params"":{""level"":""ep"",""id"":38}}) ([also accesible as an XLS by way of RAR, in Greek, via Athens' Court of First Instance](http://www.protodikeio-ath.gr/opencms_prot/opencms/ProtSite/ekloges/Vouleutikes_ekloges_6_5_2012/apotelesmata_eklogon_6_5_2012/APOTELESMATA_A_ATHINON.rar)).

You may view and download the combined data from [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8sWlN44lWd2bGxrNHlpVmJxSG8).

In citizens-only polling stations in this district, 6,34% voted for Golden Dawn. In mixed polling stations, where citizens and members of the Security Forces voted, 15,99% chose Golden Dawn. Among members of the Security Forces, Golden Dawn received 32,52%.

We are able to calculate the last percentage by subtracting the number of citizen votes from the total number of Golden Dawn votes, and dividing by the number of Security Forces votes. We can find the number of citizen votes by multiplying the turnout rate (calculated using data from the 107 citizens-only polling stations nearby) by the number of citizens registered in the electoral roll, and subsequently by Golden Dawn's percentage among citizens (also calculated using data from the nearby citizens-only polling stations).

Moving on to last June's elections in Thessaloniki.

There are 67 citizens-only and 21 mixed polling stations for citizens and members of the Police forces, in the Municipality of Kordelio-Evosmos, the seat of Thessaloniki's Police HQ. As before, we have the data from the Ministry of Interior and the [final results](http://ekloges.ypes.gr/v2012b/public/index.html?lang=en#{""cls"":""level"",""params"":{""level"":""ep"",""id"":6}}) ([also accesible an XLS by way of ZIP, in Greek, via Thessaloniki's Court of First Instance](http://www.protodikeio-thes.gr/opencms_prot/opencms/ProtSite/downloads/apot_ekl_2012/apot_synd_aperif_12a.zip)). We are able to find [24 polling stations designated for members of the Security Forces](http://www.pkm.gov.gr/inst/pkm/gallery/PKM%20files/2012%20Elections/2012_06_17_Apofaseis/2012_06_17_%CE%91_%CE%A0%CE%95%20%CE%A3%CE%A4%CE%A1%CE%91%CE%A4%CE%99%CE%A9%CE%A4%CE%99%CE%9A%CE%9F%CE%99.xls) (XLS, in Greek) in the website of the region of Central Macedonia (one of [Greece's 13 administrative divisions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_regions_of_Greece)). 3 of them were reserved for the Military.

Again, you can view and download the combined data from [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8sWlN44lWd2STNTNHVHN29rdTA).

In citizens-only polling stations in this municipality, 9,48% voted for Golden Dawn. In mixed polling stations, where citizens and members of the Police forces voted, 10,85% chose Golden Dawn. Among members of the Police forces, Golden Dawn received 20,22%. The last percentage was calculated using the procedure explained earlier.

Now, it's time for some observations.

I've read an analysis of 44 polling stations, 20 citizens-only and 20 mixed, in a part of the district where Athens Police HQ are located. The conclusion was that ""45% of Greek police vote for Golden Dawn"" (*edit: OP has since revised it, following our discussion; his projection is now about Athens alone*)

There can be no disagreement that in the recent elections, Golden Dawn's percentage among policemen seems to be significantly larger than the one found in the general population.

I've analysed data from 239 polling stations, 151 in the district where Athens Police HQ are located (107 citizens-only and 44 mixed), and 88 in Greece's second largest city (67 citizens-only and 21 mixed), in the municipality where Thessaloniki's Police HQ are located. I found that 32,52% of the Security Forces in the 7th Municipal District of Athens and 20,22% of the Police forces in the Municipality of Kordelio-Evosmos in Thessaloniki voted for Golden Dawn.

[In 2009, Golden Dawn received 19.624 votes.](http://ekloges-prev.singularlogic.eu/v2009/pages/index.html?lang=en) If 45% of the members of the Police forces had voted for them then, they would end up with more than 25.000 votes.

In 2012, after 3 years of repeated salary cuts and increasingly difficult living conditions, and with the issue of illegal immigration being a hot topic due to the incompetence of EU legislators to provide a better framework than [Dublin II](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33153_en.htm), Golden Dawn seized the opportunity and transformed itself, from a fringe to a protest party and a parliamentary power, averaging 6,92% nationally. [More than 400.000 of citizens voted for them.](http://ekloges.ypes.gr/v2012b/public/index.html?lang=en#{""cls"":""level"",""params"":{""level"":""epik"",""id"":1}})

However, saying that 1 in 2 policemen are Golden Dawn voters seems wrong.

In my analysis I've gathered data for up to 13% of the Greek Police forces. We know how many members of the Security Forces (Police, Special Guards, Coast Guard, Fire Service) voted in polling stations near Athens Police HQ. We also know that 1 in 3 voted Golden Dawn. Although the majority of them are policemen, at the moment we have no way of knowing their exact number. In the area surrounding Greece's other General Police Directorate, 1 in 5 policemen voted Golden Dawn. We still don't know how more than 85% of the policemen in the rest of Greece voted (it woud be an extremely time consuming , if not impossible project to find and analyse data from more than 20.000 polling stations), but a quick look at mixed polling stations in other major cities shows that they went nowhere near the percentage found in Athens, or even in Thessaloniki's in many cases. These cities enjoy better living conditions than the two major metropolitan centres, and crime rates are lower. Another interesting observation is that many prisoners voting in special polling stations went with Golden Dawn, probably because they're not getting along well with incarcerated illegal immigrants.

Taking into account the ""1 in 3"" scenario in Athens' centre, the ""1 in 5"" in Western Thessaloniki, and the tendency for declining Golden Dawn percentages in the rest of Greece, it seems more plausible that 1 in 5 policemen voted for Golden Dawn in the end.

tl;dr: caveat lector

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Because there are only two major things that the CAP budget can be spent on really when it comes to farming; income support for farmers to ensure that in years of low market prices due to international factors they don't go bankrupt, and for environmental sustainability. I can't give you a source because it's not as simple as looking at a source, it's in essence the entirety of the CAP.

That is odd, because I can go in and look at what the Swedish government spends, and they spend more, in much more money, in much more detail. If 2 % of the Swedish GDP goes anywhere, you can be bloody sure we can have a look at it. A budget without transparency, is corrupt. 

&gt;Those kinds of errors turn up in any kind of government funded project, it's silly to single out just the CAP for that happening

Cool, give me links of that happening in Finland.

You conveniently refuses to address Transparency Internationals report about the European Union, and a lot of the states in it, southern and eastern Europe compared to northern Europe. If Greece is number 80 on the list, Italy 69 etc, that is really, really bad, and the fact is, corruption is a major, major problem. Sweden, Finland Germany, the Netherlands, etc are all in a top 15. Are you saying that is not spilling over to the EU? It is rather obvious that northern Europe is actually much more likely to spend the money on what they are supposed to be spent on. The sad thing is also that these numbers are rather static. It is not like Spain or the other countries(number 39) are  coming from number 100. Frankly, it has been like this forever, and the EU is not doing anything about it. Frankly, the countries are corrupt, and I am bloody tired of it. 


I still are not seeing the links to why **44%** have to go to the CAP? Why do I have to pay so much more for food, while simoultaneously cutting down on research.

To be frank, I can imagine *some level* of CAP in the EU, but *not* on the levels that are now, nor as long as it is corrupt. And, it is not like the countries or the EU has been less corrupt.

&gt;FFS, how many times do I have to explain this to you? That was an example of what it goes on, once there is a need to address environmental sustainability with regards to higher levels of rain due to global warming the CAP will address that as well.

The link I gave showed that not more than 0.2% of the EUs budgets gets wasted on Fraud (which is unsurprising given that countries like Bulgaria and Romania are still not westernized with respect to societal reactions to fraud so the few areas where they have competencies likely skew the number as a result). This also addresses your point about corruption, EU institutions have less fraud than the individual countries of the EU put together on average! This benefits ALL of Europe in the long run, just as the cohesion funds benefit ALL of Europe in the long run as well.

Would 44% of one Euro be too much for you as well? It's not the percentage, it's the absolute value. Now, consider this;

The US spends [$151 billion](http://www.obpa.usda.gov/budsum/FY13budsum.pdf) on its agriculture policy, for the size of Japan's agricultural sector, it also spends a good deal more than the EU, Australia spent [$1.6 billion](http://www.daff.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/1907590/2011-12budget.pdf) despite being 25 times smaller in population

Simply put, the EU spends equal to or less than what other first world countries do! And you still want to cut it!

The link from the *EU*,the organisation who hasn't gotten their budget OK'd in 16 years!!!!! I think that says it all. I'd like links to organisations like Transparency International or something similar.

&gt;Would 44% of one Euro be too much for you as well? It's not the percentage, it's the absolute value. Now, consider this;

&gt;The US spends $151 billion on its agriculture policy, for the size of Japan's agricultural sector, it also spends a good deal more than the EU, Australia spent $1.6 billion despite being 25 times smaller in population

Frankly, I can't say I know I know a lot about the Japanese and the Australian agriculture, but I do know comparing oneself with the US is really bad, particularely from an environmental perspective. It is like saying one is good because one balances the budget better. Frankly, most countries does that. We should be the best,not compare ourself with the worst.

Yes, 44 % of the budget is to much, way to much. I am sure my country could handle it more effectively, or are you saying that Sweden couldn't? Besides, we pay more for our food, to much more. Are you saying €3/day is OK? I think it is a lot.


&gt;I said WHEN.

So, they haven't even started yet? What? So, what is the money currently going to?What have I been paying towards? Who has received the money so far? I honestly do not see how hard it can be to show me in detail where the 2 % wine subsidies of the total budget are going to? Or just link to the climate projects that they have lined up for the next 7 years. Or, are they planning to start doing that research in 2020? What is my money going to? You have to start linking. Don't you agreee, that a budget should be able to link to where the money is going too? Why can't you just link to it?  2 % - I can show that in the Swedish budget, but we are less corrupt.

Ones that you can get in Germany ... I'm not sure. I found [this forum thread on the topic at Beer Advocate](http://beeradvocate.com/community/threads/american-craft-breweries-that-distribute-to-europe.46752/#post-605478). From the comment I linked there, I can recommend most of Flying Dog's offerings, Victory's IPA, and Sierra Nevada's IPA.

The best American beers come from Michigan, but most aren't even distributed outside of the American Midwest. If you can get your hands on anything by Short's (more experimental American ales; I'm drinking [an ale with dill, horseradish, peppercorn, and celery seed](http://www.shortsbrewing.com/beer/our-portfolio/specialty-beers/bloody-beer/?iAmLegal=1) at the moment) or Jolly Pumpkin (Belgian style ales, including lambics), those are the gold standard in my book. Short of that, Bell's Brewery makes solid beers, and they are a much larger brewer (i.e. more likely to be found outside of my region).

Hope that helps (and that I stopped myself before going overboard)!

**E.T.A.:** I assume that you prefer lagers to ales, so, in the event that you ever come to Michigan, do yourself a favor and go to [Wolverine State Brewing Company](http://wolverinebeer.com/the-lagers/).

The Mondeo is a cool car, but there were some disappointments. The engine noise is really low though, and no, when the engine is idling I don't hear a loud noise. It's not as good as a petrol car, but both the noise reduction and vibration absorption have been improved from the previous model imo.


You might notice a difference because of the cold weather. Cars now have automatic fuel regulation and it will give the engine more fuel if its not warmed up, which in turn would raise your idling RPM making the engine a bit louder. If it's not that and the guys at a Ford service tell you everything's ok, I wouldn't worry. Although if it's really really bothering you, try asking the guys at talkford.com or just to be sure, get it looked at, by another dealer.


As for sturdiness, I completely agree. I'm sure they built it properly, but I also have a feeling of I'd say isolation. You just don't connect with the car, you don't feel the road, you don't hear the wind, it keeps the RPM up during shifts for smooth shifting, I don't even have to use a key to start it. It's cool but at the same time it feels wrong, I can't really give a concrete description. It's a computer first and car second I guess.
