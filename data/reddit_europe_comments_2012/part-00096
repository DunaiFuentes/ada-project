I think a lot comes down to the fact that hosting a war in your own homeland really scars the country and the culture for several generations. Our grandparents and great grandparents were involved, as children, in city bombings. They had to hide away from buildings and roads when the sirens rang, because bombers could attack houses and groups of refugees. In very short, the France you see, and its culture, was built by such people.

So yes, I believe you will find that people in France and Europe are more defiant about life in general and as a result less open to innovation and eccentricity, but this is just a reminder of the wars that shaped our country.

(E con valide intendo: non facciamo l'errore di credere che nel Nord Europa si usino i mezzi __solo__ per innato senso civico... Li si usano perché si arriva prima, si spende meno e sono puliti, non affollati e confortevoli.)

2) Per quanto riguarda la salute, leggevo (credo sul Corriere) che da quanto è stata istituita l'area C, è aumentato il traffico al di fuori di essa. Hanno diritto alla salute solo gli abitanti all'interno della Cerchia dei Bastioni? Ancora una volta si dimostra che la coercizione non porta le persone a scegliere diversamente, ma solo ad andare (in macchina, of course) a far shopping da qualche altra parte...

Tecnologie più richieste: domanda troppo vaga, dipende dal settore e dalla tua specializzazione. Prima di pensare alle tecnologie dovresti capire per cosa ti senti più portato: programmazione, system integration, system administration, networking, dba, ecc

Il consiglio che ti dò è di proporti come programmatore junior in una ditta di consulenza (le famose body rental) e di farti qualche anno di esperienza così. Le ditte di consulenza ti prestano brutalmente ad ogni cliente che paga. Quando inizi è ottimo perchè ti capita di vedere lavori diversi, tecnologie diverse, clienti diversi. Insomma ti fai la gavetta. 

L'importante è che non ti lascino a vegetare dal cliente, se succede chiedi di essere spostato presso un altro cliente o licenziati. Ricorda che l'indicatore più importante di come sta andando la tua carriera non è quanti soldi guadagni o che ruolo occupi ma quante cose stai imparando. Soprattutto nei primi anni (ma in realtà anche poi) devi sempre continuare ad imparare, non avere paura di affrontare cose che non conosci, anzi sfrutta tutte le opportunità per imparare una cosa nuova.

Non ti limitare alla programmazione, cerca di fare un po' di tutto, anche il sysadmin o qualsiasi cosa ti chiedono. Dopo 2-3 anni dovresti avere una buona visione dei vari lavori del settore e sicuramente avrai le idee più chiare su cosa ti piace fare e cosa no. Tenere i piedi in più staffe (programmazione, sysadmin, ecc) è utile quandi inizi sia per capire cosa ti piace sia per tecnicamente per avere le basi. Ma prima dei 35 anni devi assolutamente scegliere una carriera e una specializzazione e puntare solo su quella.

Molto spesso le società di consulenza ti prestano a società grosse, quando hai qualche anno di esperienza e ti senti pronto per fare il grande salto cerca di farti mandare in consulenza presso una multinazionale (ce ne sono tante), se lavori bene dopo qualche anno ti assumeranno e da lì la tua carriera sarà sempre in crescita se lavori bene.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; That article is absurdly pedantic. 

Might be the reason I quoted the relevant disclaimer about iron age and voting. Yes the article certainly is pedantic but I found it funny, interesting and informative. I'm a big fan of history lessons and for example had never before heard of a monk named Bede (shame on me). Good reading.

The article defines whole affair as a ""mini-controversy"" and ""micro-scandal"", and rightly so, IMO.

&gt; Anglo Saxon is not used to refer to ethnicity, unless that is the clearly delineated context. It is a generalized way to refer to political, economic, cultural and legal codes which arose from or were championed by England or the British isles. 

And in USA it also seems to contain a refence to ruling white upper class as in [WASPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestant). And it also works as a code word for ""white"" (but not just any white). I gather that is the reason for some mild protest among some americans.

Implication was also noted in Daily Telegraph's original atricle: [Mitt Romney would restore 'Anglo-Saxon' relations between Britain and America](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/mitt-romney/9424524/Mitt-Romney-would-restore-Anglo-Saxon-relations-between-Britain-and-America.html)

*""In remarks that may prompt accusations of racial insensitivity, one suggested that Mr Romney was better placed to understand the depth of ties between the two countries than Mr Obama, whose father was from Africa.
“We are part of an Anglo-Saxon heritage, and he feels that the special relationship is special,” the adviser said of Mr Romney, adding: “The White House didn’t fully appreciate the shared history we have”.""*

What I want is serious quantitative easing. I don't care if the money comes our way.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;What exactly is there in Poland that would be of special interest to the US

First, from what I've read, Poland is a rising economic power.

Second, many Republicans think that Eastern Europe is less socialistic, more supportive of US wars, and more socially conservative than Western and Northern Europe.  They therefore like Poland and will favorably view Romney's visit to Poland.

I realize that might offend some Poles, so remember that I'm not saying Polish people are like Republicans, but only that many Republicans perceive the Poles as kindred spirits who are ""doing it right,"" as opposed to the more liberal, socialistic western/northern Europeans.  Remember Bush's line about ""Old Europe"" (France, Germany) vs. ""New Europe"" (Poland, Estonia, etc)?  That's the idea.

Next, there is a Polish meme in US politics; Romney's visit to Poland might be part of an effort to revive that meme.  In 2004, the Democratic candidate, John Kerry, was debating George W. Bush, who was running for re-election.  Kerry was listing US military allies when he was interrupted by Bush, who said, ""You forgot Poland.""  The cameras swiveled to Bush, who then chastised Kerry on TV for not remembering an ally that sent troops to Iraq and Afghanistan.  This became a big moment in the 2004 campaign because many people concluded from it that Kerry was weak on national security and lacked sufficient knowledge of our foreign affairs.  It helped get Bush re-elected.  Since the Republicans benefited from the incident, which didn't happen that long ago, they like to periodically hint that the Democrats have, again, ""forgotten Poland.""  I suspect Romney will start chastising Obama for allegedly ""forgetting Poland"" in some sense right around the time he visits Poland, if he hasn't done so already.

Poland is also near Russia, our eternal enemy, and is anti-Russian (from what I've gathered), so Poland would be a great place for US military installations, at least from the perspective of the US government.

Finally, there might be conservative, wealthy US expats in Poland who want to donate money to Romney's campaign.",0,1343362440,null,0,1343362826,0,c5k2kwd,t3_x6ruq,t1_c5k2kwd,t1_c5jsjds,null,1429481273,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

Per esperienza personale ti posso dire che ci sono ben poche web-agency disposte ad assumere a tempo indeterminato...di solito programmatori/grafici sono freelance (quindi con partita iva).


Nel mio caso (sviluppatore web) dopo l'università ho fatto una stage post-universitario durato 6 mesi e dopo sono stato assunto a tempo indeterminato (sono li da quasi 5 anni): per certi versi sono stato fortunato per molti altri è una disgrazia (sottopagato, mancanza di meritocrazia, crescita, ecc...).


Anche io sono dell'idea che ogni 4/5 anni sia giusto guardarsi in giro (anche prima se necessario) in modo da non stagnarsi su una realtà aziendale che potrebbe risultare controproducente: Internet cresce a ritmi spaventosi, chi si ferma è morto (poi qui dipende anche da quanta passione hai tu a riguardo, per quanto tu ne abbia sappi che arriverai a casa stanco quindi riuscirai ben poco a lavorare su progetti extra-personali).


Un altro consiglio che ti do è di non sottovalutare il tuo CV, cerca di scriverlo al meglio...mi è capitato di fare selezione e devo dire che ne ho viste di cotte e di crude.

Across those nations, the US has been able to cover the world, but more importantly a major player in two theaters, the Pacific and Atlantic. With the rise of China and Russia, the US is starting to shift it's focus towards the Pacific.

They didn't.

The first is the short chronology theory with the first movement beyond Alaska into the New World occurring no earlier than 15,000 – 17,000 years ago, followed by successive waves of immigrants.

* Ever increasing energy prices: oil and gas prices are only going up, and in most countries only politically feasible new energy production forms are wind and solar which are much more expensive than fossil fuels.
* Shrinking generations: in most EU countries newer generations are smaller than the ones they replace. Essentially this means that our maintenance relation, working adult per dependent, is going down. The problem is increased by our pensions system that the older generations haven't fully contributed to.
* Increasing global competition: more and more developing countries are competing in with products and services previously manufactured in developed countries. Developed countries need to either push forward to compete with higher tech or sophistication, or they need to increase efficiency of production to maintain current standards of living.

What we need to do to match these challenges is to...

* Invest in energy production and increase efficiency of energy usage
* Cut govermeant spending to match incomes with expenditure. Cut govermeant employment to free human resources for the private sector.
* Add incentives for the private sector to invest in R&amp;D and liberalize the labor market for the private sector to increase its flexibility and ability to take risks.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; There are good arguments for cutting down on the public sector but that is not one of them. Unemployment is a problem, how does creating more help the private sector or anyone else for that matter?

The thing is that not all employment is good, and not all employes produce. In the private sector internal inefficiencies are constantly addressed and unnecessary or unproductive people are fired. The same work and produce can be had with lesser amount of people. This same should applied to the public sector, current results should be produced with lesser amounts of employees, and the best way to force that is to just fire certain amount of people, and make the rest find ways to produce what is needed.

And those persons who will be unemployed, the state will benefit by having smaller costs, and when labor market is liberalized, markets will use these new resource at their market price. Also some former employees will start up new businesses generating even more produce for the whole economy.

&gt; You are right that printing money alone will not solve the underlying problems but committing econimic suicide by trying to tax and cut your way out of a depression sure as hell isn't the answer either. Of course budgets need to be balanced but it should be blatently obvious by now that after a certain point cutting and taxing shrink the economy to the point where your measures are counter productive and the overall deficit does not decrease significantly or actually increases. The stop spending more than you earn and everything will be okay attitude is over simplistic and reflects how politicians would like things to be instead of how they really are. You need a bit of earn more so you can afford to spend more too.

Well then when are states going to do necessary reforms if not now? Most European states didn't do any market liberalizations or cut down public spending in good times, why should the public believe that they will do it now? In my honest opinion the only way for necessary reforms and transformation to happen is to force them. If states won't force them, then the markets will force the states to do them, or states will face lower standards of living to their citizens.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"I think that many Republican establishment figures believe that the current importance of the radical Tea Party would have forced them to at least pay lip service to so many far-right ideas in order to win the primaries that any Republican candidate who survived that process would end up looking too radical to win the general election.

That's because the conventional wisdom is that the American electorate is divided rather evenly between Republican loyalists and Democratic loyalists, with the election therefore being determined by a relatively small demographic of ""independents.""  These people rejected the Tea Party politics of the McCain/Palin ticket in 2008, and it is thought that they will do so again.  Obama is a charismatic candidate with a pretty good record, from the perspective of many American voters, and it is thought that he will seem like a moderate (which independents favor) as compared to the Republican, who would either have to stand by the radical promises he made to the Tea Party or reverse course and look like a political opportunist who just says what he needs to say to win elections (indeed, this has happened to Romney, who runs the risk of becoming a walking joke as a result).

Obama is somewhat vulnerable because voters tend to blame the president for any economic trouble the country encounters, even if it is not the president's fault.  It has been unclear how the economy might change before the election - for example, will Greece exit the Euro, causing negative economic effects in America which angry and uninformed voters will pin on the president?  So he is vulnerable in the sense that he might suffer a drop in popularity based on possible downturns in the economy.

I didn't realize that in fact you will have the opportunity to move around! That's great!

Concerning the time period: like Coin-coin said below, I would advise you to go in May/June: the weather will probably be quite nice and warm, the days will be waaaay much longer and the place won't be crawling with tourists.
Mind you, you can also go skiing in the Alps all year round in some high altitude ski resorts (won't be as nice as during the November-February time period but it is still possible). But that will be quite a trip from Paris (I'm talking about something around 7 hours driving).

If you are willing to drive up until Germany, Switzerland, ... Boy oh boy ... There will be so much to see, you will probably have to plan your trip carefuly and decide on a few locations. I would give the general advice to take your time, there's no rush and you can miss so much if you just rush from one place to the other just to complete your checklist (as many tour operator tourists do).
From the beaches of the WW2 landing of Normandy, to the cliffs of Britanny, to the mounts of Auvergne, the pine forests of Aquitaine, to the Pyrenées moutains, to the french Riviera and lavender fields, up through the Alps, Jura, Vosges and Alsace, there's just soooooo much to see that I cannot advise on just 1 or 2 specific locations (and that's only France!

true,DivineKing,UNSA,United States,"&gt; Your post implies, very typically, that people without religion can't tell right from wrong (here it was expressed as ""good"" and ""evil""), that essentially they have no morals. You fail to realize notice the capiricious and arbitrary behavior of any god you can imagine. 

You didn't demonstrate, or even try to demonstrate how a Godless person can logically have morals.  I have to assume that's your acceptance that I'm right.

&gt; You also fail to realize that when you do something because god said to, that's not morality, that's just following orders.

The Cosmos has an order to it.  The only way to approach the Transcendent is to follow that Divine order.  It's not a question of God saying so, it's a question of realizing the most basic and fundamental truth.

&gt; As is often said, morality is what you do when no one is looking. The love of an atheist is worth much more than the ""love"" of a theist. 

An atheist first fails to see the order in the Cosmos.  They then base their actions on pure sentimentality - essentially just doing things because they were taught one way on a totally materialistic level.

And of course this is not an accurate estimate of their true genetic ancestors.

People feel that way or at least responded so in a questionary.

While I know what you mean('contractors' are awesome), there's another end of it when it comes to starts ups vs. traditional small business: Buyouts and VC. 

Venture capital types like a lean startup, but they do not like things that even have *potential* to explode in their faces: and that includes hiring practices done with a nod and a wink. Beyond that employees are a significant part of the value of a start-up, and their presence(as full time employees instead of under the table/part-timers) means higher valuations, which means more VC and higher buy-out offers.

1. The demise of capitalism has been predicted many times, and it was always wrong. 

2. I think this time it's going to happen. This is mainly due to what took place in the 1970s in the states. The Republican party was hijacked by fanatics, they whole political spectrum moved to the ""irrational""/libertarian/christian"" right. As a result,  funding for scientific/technological research was either diminishing or research was stagnating for years. Right now we are reaping the last fruits of the latest part of the post 1945 . Without rapid technological change (""revolutionising the means of production"") capitalism cannot function. It reverts to Feudalism. 

3. We have a crisis of overproduction. There is too much capital in too few hands. Apple for example has 250 Billion of cash. 

4. The ""nouveaux"" capitalists of (Especially the Arabs and Russians) don't actually push a high-tech agenda, prefering to invest in western funds or diamonds and golden cars. 


Here is what I expect: 

There is not going to be anything violent, the capitalist mode of production will just collapse. After the collapse either said parties (+anybody reasonable across the political spectrum) will take charge and install a sane system (""communism from below"") OR mafia/underground-like organisations (of whatever political ""colour"") will rule Europe and we will enter a new dark ages.

true,theICEBear_dk,null,null,"The growth of the Enhedlisten is actually mostly fueled by internal politics as Danish politics has been split between navel-gazing and running the EU for half a year (just finished). The centrist-left coalition in government is made up of the Centrist-right wing ""Radikale Venstre"", the historically big centrist-left ""Socialdemokraterne"" (which used to be an entirely left wing party but the current leadership thinks they can take a page out of Tony Blair's Labour playbook and get ahead, but they've misread the population. And finally the government is made up by the leftist Socialistisk Folkeparti which has never been apart of a government before. The government was elected last year in November and has disappointed its voters by mainly leading what is perceived as a centrist-right set of politics, either without explanation (likely to keep the Radikale Venstre in the coalition) or because of austerity measures. 

At the same time the right wing has become very media dominant these recent years so the especially papers and half the Danish speaking TV channel spend most of their times slapping the leftists around the head with various issues so when the politicians in government react with centrist policies the very-left leaning population feel betrayed. This has mainly happened for the same reasons as elsewhere where the cash strapped papers are now owned and run by the corporations and they are at the very least influencing the public debate that way. One of the right wing parties is almost fully subsidized by various companies and its opinions seems to change with their sponsors opinions (has been caught doing this on for example nuclear power politics, which they were against until getting a sponsor for it) and seems to mainly attract the young middle manager type of voter.

Enhedslisten also has a very charismatic leader in Johanne Schmidt Nielsen which has done wonders to wrangle her party which is a unification of various semi or fully radical left-wing groups like the former Communist Party of Denmark and the Anarchist movement.

Finally this has all lead to particularly the Socialistisk Folkeparti voters migrating further left to get to some politicians with enough fervor and idealism to at least have an opinion and which seems willing to make media unpopular decisions even when they contradict with what the PR consultants think (another systemic problem at the moment is the bureaucrat/media consultant guided way everything seems to be run). 

What remains to be seen at this point is how long the electorate will remain angry with their former parties. Denmark used to have a very left wing population but as it has aged and the media has changed the right wing has become a lot more popular, so it is more likely in fact right now (baring a financial crash or a Danish version of Libor in the management of Cibor (possible but suppressed by the various banks and bureaucrats if it has happened)) that the right wing will take over again even though it is their mess the left wing government is trying to fix.

I agree with all of your points, but it must be said the behavior of both the EZ leaders and Spain is perfectly understandable, the EZ want our banks to survive so they can keep paying their debts and Rajoy's government wants the bailout to save Bankia, the Popular Party bank. As you see none of them really cares about the little guy. 

Regarding the survival of the spanish banks, AFAIK, only Bankia and CAM have asked for money, but I have no doubt that as soon as the banks are ordered to price their assets at market value, instead of at bubble prices, all of them will need public help, with the possible exception of Santander, BBVA and La Caixa, as SAN and BBVA have enough activity in other regions and La Caixa owns shares of many companies. 
The problem then will be that those troubled banks are huge, so we cannot do what you did in the nineties, because we don't have any money to finance the opertation, and the ECB won't let them fail, because then we would bring down the world economy as French and German banks have no use for overprized terrain and half built houses, so they would experiment loses similar to the whole GDP of Sweden!

The other matter i'm talking about is that it's bad this migration, because like you said there is no European state, while a Californian working in Texas contributes to the US a Portuguese working in Germany contributes nothing to Portugal, he is generating zero wealth to the country there are no money transfers in the EU like on US so the different countries conditions will only get worse.

Really? The reason the U.S. is so entwined with Europe is specifically because we're world police? It has nothing to do with our contribution in WWII? The Marshall Plan? Us, effectively, being the lynchpin and leading member of NATO? 

&gt;Sometimes you guys are called ""world police"" because you always interfere and intervene (also with the military) in other countries. There is no denying the influence and the size of the U.S. (politically, historically, economically, etc.), but there is also no denying that the U.S. is just another country.

We are just like any other country, but we also provide a fuckton of military support and cooperation to European countries. In fact, and I know this is a unpopular opinion here, but I think it's the sole reason why Europe is capable of retaining so many small militaries and able to divert a lot of the money they would've spent on defense to social programs. 

The Fulda Gap, Kosov or Libya, all of these go to show that when Europe needed us, we were there, and when they couldn't get the job done themselves, we were more than happy to step up and help. We didn't ask for a ""Thanks"" or nothing. In fact, all I see is the opposite, especially when it comes to Libya. I can't count how many times I've heard this from Europeans:

*""Imperialist America is trying to drive us into another war with Libya!""* 

*""I can't believe our leaders are acting like America's dogs to take down Gaddafi!""*

When in fact, Europe was the first one in Libya and America didn't want to get involved at first, but after it became apparent [that the operation would fail without U.S. Military Support or Leadership](http://www.economist.com/node/21528248), Obama finally gave the okay. 

But that doesn't fit with their confirmation bias, so it's ""alright"" to say it was America's fault because they were warmongers...because...you know....fuck the facts.

&gt;You may have a very different history than other countries have, but you are still a country -with a lot of flaws- nontheless. The notion of American exceptionalism is regarded by Europeans as an outlandish idea that possibly stems from too much patriotism (something that Europeans may view as nationalistic even - a concept that has always been regarded in a negative light since WW2 by most).

I can agree with you on the history part. And while I don't think it's a bad thing to be proud of where you come from,  I respect your view on it. 

&gt;You may personally disagree with the idea of American exceptionalism, but the idea is still very much alive in your political system as well as throughout your culture.

As it is in yours. How many times have I heard that Europe is ""superior"" to the United States because of the death penalty? Because of the number of atheists you guys have? Because of the fact you're left leaning? All while ignoring the problems you guys possess? You're just like any other country (or countries) in this regard. We're no different, we just get more attention (as seen here).

Regarding the remaining banks, their problem with collateral is that due to our absurd laws we've allowed the banks to keep their assests (houses and land) valued at 2007 prices, while the market prices are 40% lower, waiting some kind of miracle that would reactivate the economy (I haven't seen this posted in /r/europe and I think it's more serious than the bailout itself) Also, the only relevant collateral of many banks are those terrains and buildings, so we'll be only passing the problem to the ones that received the goods (I'm sure the Swedish Government have better things to do than try to sell villas in Marbella and pay property taxes for it)",0,1343420009,null,0,false,0,c5ke0hr,t3_x8x2a,t1_c5ke0hr,t1_c5kdlu7,null,1429486782,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I said because we have a conscience. If we do something bad, we feel bad, so there is incentive not to do bad.  

&gt;There's no scientific objective reason to want a well-functioning society over anything else  

We want a well-functioning society in order to try and increase our quality of life. The better our quality of life, the more easy it will be to stay mentally and physically healthy, stay alive, and reproduce. Thus, it is in our evolutionary interest to strive for a better society.   

&gt;I think you aren't. Presumably each thought is equally valid, so therefore there's no reason for me not to kill you.

The concept of worth is completely subjective. If you really want to get objective about it, you can't say that god is objectively worth anything because perhaps I don't want god. Therefore, to me he would be worthless. Would it matter to god what I think? Would he be worthless just because I thought of him so? Not necessarily. He gives himself worth, just like I give myself worth. However, if you want god, then he is worth something to you, but only to you. In society, we don't go around killing people even if they seem worthless to us, because they might be worth something to other people, who in turn, might be worth something to us. Again, this goes back to empathy and to how a society functions. If people go around killing each other just because worth is subjective, society won't function correctly, and we might destroy ourselves.

true,SimonGray,DENK,Nørrebro,"I think Europe on average does have less entrepreneurship than many other places, but I don't agree with the view that this is necessarily required for economic growth.

As an example, South Korea developed rapidly and is still developing very fast using an economic model which completely disregards the needs of entrepreneurs and instead encourages gigantic conglomerates that suck up all the talent in huge projects. Conglomerates like Samsung, Hyundai, LG, etc. are still innovating quite a lot, inventing a bunch of new technologies and South Korea is AFAIK the country with the highest patent registrations per capita in the world - this is all accomplished in an economy which doesn't give a shit about encouraging entrepreneurs and hardly any South Korean dreams of starting his/her own business, they all just want to get a salaried position at Samsung.

I personally think start-ups and entrepreneurship makes for more interesting economic growth, but it's certainly not required.

While the Economist will occasionally write articles about the successes of alternative economic models, such as the ones found in Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Sweden, etc. they somehow always figure out that the only way to achieve economic growth is through the good, old, anglo-saxon, lets-all-pretend-every-country-can-have-a-Silicon-Valley-if-it-wants-to pipe dream. Yeah, Silicon Valley is great, ""Creative Destruction"" is a nice economic theory, but seriously we have all these places that are doing great despite not copying America's economic policies, maybe it's time to review the default advice that they always arrive at?

En fait, ses propos condamnés rejoignent principalement le ""combat pour les animaux"". Un peu comme des féministes peuvent désormais se faire traiter d'islamophobes parce qu'elles généralisent à l'ensemble de la religion musulmane des pratiques douteuses envers le genre féminin, Bardot s'est retrouvée accusée souvent de racisme pour associer les musulmans à des égorgeurs de moutons.

C'est plus de la bêtise et du préjugé que de la haine pure.
Après, elle a aussi un regard très critique sur l'immigration ; un regard de nationaliste, de réactionnaire, et de personne attaché à certaines valeurs. Je ne les partage pas, ces valeurs, mais je comprends qu'on puisse se sentir ""attaqué"" par l'immigration à ce niveau ou par un changement radical dans le paysage culturel, religieux, politique et social de la France.

Personnellement, je suis athée. Et je respecte les croyants, mais pas vraiment les croyances en tant que telles. Le rapport à la femme des monothéismes chrétiens et musulmans me dégoûtent, par exemple, même dans leurs versions les plus ""soft"" ou ""progressistes"". Alors je comprends (sans pour autant adhérer) lorsqu'un discours de haine est issu d'une amoureuse des animaux, et vise la religion musulmane lorsque la personne s'imagine que tous les musulmans égorgent des moutons dans leur baignoire.

""La France c'est aussi l'acceptation des cultures et les droits de l'homme.""

Ah bon ? Oui, dans les dorures de la République.
Mais celle-ci est, en pratique, assimilationniste (on ""accepte"" pas les cultures, en France, on les soumet ; d'où les multiples débats sur la religion musulmane par exemple), et a toujours prôné les droits de l'Homme sans véritablement les respecter. La France a été un ""grand pays"", est l'est encore. Ce qui signifie qu'elle s'assoit sur les Droits de l'Homme dès qu'elle a des intérêts économiques, militaires ou politiques en jeu.

En fait, des positions comme celles de Bardot sont plus proches de tout ce qui a été fait ou vécu en France depuis nos vieux royaumes et empires, et même au sein de nos précédentes Républiques, qu'autre chose.

La France, c'est aussi ça : une culture créée quasiment ad hoc, qui s'imagine éternelle et universelle, et pour qui une partie de la planète est composée de barbares. C'est un ""soft power"" qui prend ses racines (par automatisme, j'ai tapé ""racismes"", hahaha) dans ses anciennes colonies.

Ouais, c'est infect. Mais c'est un aspect de la France que beaucoup de gens adorent. 

""""T'as vu on se fait des bisoux dans la rue et on a des choses à manger"" c'est juste une partie de notre patrimoine.""

Dans lequel tout doit passer tout d'abord par le Travail (""fais tes études OU trouve un homme, mais pas les deux en même temps !""), ou dans lesquelles l'homme et la femme ne sont pas nécessairement faits pour s'aimer à tout âge et librement (très très fortes différences d'âge culturellement imposées, femme devant rester vierge, etc.).

Franchement, depuis mes 14-15 ans, je me rends compte qu'une grande partie de ma vie a été consacrée à l'amour, aux couples, et aux plaisirs que cela peut procurer. Une immense majorité de mes amis, y compris les bosseurs fous, considèrent cela comme une priorité également ; largement devant le fric, pour une bonne partie d'entre eux d'ailleurs, même si cela dépend.

First part with transformation was good.

Healthcare propagande was terrible, does not belong in an opening ceromony for the Olympics.

Musical thing went on for waaaayy too long.

Mr. Bean thing was pretty hillarious.

The whole Thames thing/the thing with the Queen was interesting enough.

Nations walking is was boring as hell - but it always is when there's 205 nations to represent

Disappointed they had Arctic Monkeys and Paul McCartney play instead of having Muse play the official song for the Olympics, but I'm a Muse fan so this part may be biased.

- Use trip advisor but don't rely on it. The world wont end if you turn up and the room sucks. 

- Always lock your door when in your room. I had two near instances of invasion when I was travelling so it's very important. Even if you're in the room for a moment. 

- Use a bag that a) doesn't have a zip clearly obvious and b) doesn't have valuables in an outside pocket.

- Don't expect everything to be on time. Most things will be delayed, especially trains.

- Always carry cash with you. ATMs can be difficult to find and definitely prepare in advance for booking out of hostels/hotels.

- When in Naples, DO NOT GET IN A CAB THAT DOESN'T HAVE A METER. Seriously. I did that but I was very lucky that our driver was a good guy. It's a very dangerous city. (I had some pretty horrible things happen there). Edit: The worst part is that these cab drivers will rip you off, since they have no way of indicating what charge rate they will do per kilometer. The lowest they generally ask for 18 euro so it can be rather expensive for a short trip. 

- Wear closed in shoes in Naples. There is a lot of glass on the streets. A lot. And trash. 

Edit: As a further little note to kind of emphasise the danger of being in Naples, when I was leaving my hotel, the staff would ensure that I had no jewellery on my person and would even supply a cheap watch for me to wear out, in place of my other slightly expensive one. They were already anticipating that I would be robbed and had set up a hotel policy to prevent it.

-you can't miss the citrus-based economy. go ahead and enjoy it though, because all the lemon and orange flavored candies and sorbettos really are pretty damn good

-take a ferry to check out Capri (recommend going from Sorrento) but don't waste time at the usual tourist traps; walk through the city of Capri and head to the top of Mt. Solari from Anacapri

-Non-negotiable: take a bus to Amalfi, passing through Positano. Super easy from Sorrento, get a cheap ticket at the station. it's one of the best rides you'll ever have and the beauty is breathtaking. I took a bus there and a ferry on the way back just so I could have both experiences and views.

Tralasciando le seconde me gravissime conseguenze per gli utenti e concentrandoci su quelle per gli sviluppatori significa che avresti a che fare con ambienti di sviluppo tendenzialmente costosi, sia lato hardware che lato licenze e/o fee da sostenere per la pubblicazione; sforzi enormi per mantenere la stessa applicazione su piattaforme radicalmente differenti tra di loro inoltre gli ambienti e gli ecosistemi sarebbero completamente controllati dalla corporation di turno (oggi è Apple, domani è MS o Google) che farebbero il cattivo ed il bel tempo sulla tua giornata lavorativa (leggasi: bug non documentati, documentazioni lacunose)

Ora, è facile fare un parallelo con le console per i videogiochi: differente piattaforme, costi alti di sviluppo e porting però lì stiamo parlando di margini che giustificano tali investimenti in personale e tempo. Inoltre i cicli di vita erano tali da garantire un minimo di pace mentale (e comunque neanche tanta, vedi le defezioni da stress in EA) agli sviluppatori. Nel mercato mobile i cicli di vita di framework, documentazione, API e nell'ordine del biennio: significa che ogni due anni prenderai la maggioranza di ciò che hai imparato e la quasi totalità del codice scritto e lo butterai nel cesso perché la big corporation di turno ha deciso così.

Nel mercato delle 'app' domina la long tail delle applicazioni che vendono poco o niente mentre sono poche, pochissime le applicazioni che riescono a fatturare cifre degne di questo nome.

In other words, they would manage customer accounts and extend loans to companies in the real economy, thereby fending off a recession. Much of the investment banking sector, on the other hand, would be liquidated as part of the insolvency proceedings.

So her plan is to have every country in the Eurozone with debt in excess of 60% undergo a partial default in order to reach that threshold, then have each state inject capital into their banks. Wouldn't these states have to borrow money in order to inject enough capital into the banks? Not only that, but a partial default in most of these countries would completely destroy investor confidence in government bonds.

Naples has a really bad reputation and many specific areas are filled with camorra mobsters, drug dealers and so on. There are some areas in Naples you really have to avoid. One is Forcella, and it's really close to the center (this means it's easy to end up walking there and get robbed or to get into a clan war gunfight) another is the Central Station (mostly scams/pickpocketing) also avoid like the plague Secondigliano, Scampia, Sanità, Quartieri Spagnoli and Poggioreale. If you want to visit one of these neighborhoods only go together with a local. 

Also don't expect cars to stop at pedestrian crossing or maybe even at red traffic lights. Pay a lot of attention when you're crossing the road. 

Also pay attention to your belongings when walking in the streets. There's people that lives doing scooter robberies. Basically two people on a scooter will target you and steal your bag/purse/necklace and just get away as fast as they can since all this happens while they're still on the scooter.

Norway: Is the Saudi-Arabia of Europe. Invests money wisely. Small population. Basically they can sell their products on the world market. Relatively little trade with neighbour countries.

Switzerland: Neutral in psychology. Has lots of offshore banking. However CHF is linked to EURO. In 2100 will probably be part of the EU. :-)

Outside Monetary Union, but within EU:

Denmark: EU member, small population, at the moment heavily hit by Economic Crisis. Would probably have been better off within Monetary Union.

Sweden: see Denmark. Also neutralist tradition. Neutralist countries will need more time to test the water before further integration with rest of EU is accepted.

Great Britain: it is not in the interest of the elite (which is still pretty much really an elite by birth) of GB to integrate further in the EU (City of London banking regulations, hereditary interests, some people haven't let the Empire behind them, etc.). Press aids elite in letting the GB man-in-to-street think that the EU is the worst thing on earth.

Yes.

&gt;Is it really required for stability and peace to have such deep integration?

Some integration is required for peace and stability, though this integration is IMO more regarding economic stability and growth.

&gt;Do we need one constitution and one currency?

I think we do, though if some countries disagree, they can and should always be able to opt-out.

&gt;Aren't the differences between nations the charm of Europe?

There's much more to Europe to that. I personally think there are more things that unify us than those that separate us. Others might disagree and say they're nothing like the rest of the Europeans but that's fine.

&gt;Doesn't a trade union suffice?

Not if we want to remain competitive against countries like the USA, Russia, China and India.

IMO, we need the EU but it certainly can be improved. What I disagree with is when people point out some flaws of the EU and say that because of those flaws, the EU should be scrapped and everyone should be on their own - forgetting how nasty the past centuries were when there was no European integration.

We can cross borders without much hassle, we can trade if people from all over Europe, we can just as easily invest in EU countries as we would in our own, now we have the chance to protect these rights and to increase them by making Europe even stronger.

true,eddarval,PORT,Portugal,"The EU was born because of 2 fears.

The first was the fear of a 3rd World War ravaging the continent. Europe has been in a constant state of war since the fall of the Roman Empire. Even if at some points in time we weren't in *de facto* state of war, the threat of it was always constant. The constant rivalry between England and France, Portugal and Spain, Spain and France, and between the micro-states that would later form both Germany and Italy. War has always been a constant in the continent. This ended with the WWII when the continent was effectively divided in two and the European Empires collapsed. This is brings us to the second fear.

The second fear was the fear of the ""Communist Threat"". Europe was afraid that the Eastern Empire could advance, and with that, tampon states like Poland come into play after WWI. That was a common fear to all countries. The fear of an invasion from Russia (which to a degree was also constant before the XX century, but the country didn't had the effective power to actually invade before). 

Geo-politically speaking, the EU is the only way continental Europe has to avoid starting another war. Without the EU, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK would be rivals. We could see the birth of alliances like the ones that lead us to WWI. The rise on commercial protectionism, a run to weaponry, increased tensions and Europe would again fall into the spiral of wars that is plaguing us for a millennium. The problem with this spiral in our days is the weapons we use. The war with the European powers fighting each others would be a total war.

Sure you can say we don't need to fear Russian anymore, but don't we, really? And you can say that EU has done it's job, and I would agree to some extent, but that doesn't mean it's not needed. It's not to say we should move the concept of EU to a complete Federal State, but which better way to make sure the continent isn't destroyed by war if the continent is one single entity?

true,Dylz,UNSA,United States,"1. There's a ton of organizational and logistical infrastructure in NATO that it would be senseless to toss away without good reason.

2. The US military has an ability to relatively quickly deploy en-mass anywhere in the world that the Europeans don't. Also, the US has various support and force multiplication assets that European countries don't. By working with the US, they gain some access to these capabilities.

3. Despite some acrimony during the Bush administration, the European countries do, generally, want to keep the US interested in Europe. Our interests internationally do generally align.

4. Diplomacy itself is an investment. There's always a risk in renegotiating treaties and alliance structures. If the parties are generally satisfied with the current arrangement, there no reason to take the risk of changing everything up.

All that being said, the US would love if the European powers created a stronger, centralized, military force that was still a part of NATO. It would take some of the burden off of US forces in joint operations and make coordination easier.

*Realized this sounds like a very ""YAAAAYYYYY UNITED STATES!"" reply, so I'm adding another:

5. In addition to NATO being beneficial to the Europeans, it's also beneficial to the US. European cooperation is invaluable to the US logistically, tactically, and diplomatically, as seen in operations in Libya and the Middle East. European countries have a great deal of soft-power and knowledge that the US doesn't, especially in particular parts of the world like the Middle East and Africa. European countries are also well placed to provide us with logistical support when operating in those regions. And finally, when an operation is underway, every soldier, machine, and dollar helps.

Some members of the conservative establishment in the US think the US would be better off without NATO. These people are foolish. Thankfully, this kind of thinking declined during Bush's second term.",0,1343483931,null,0,1343503168,0,c5kp5e5,t3_xaplq,t1_c5kp5e5,t3_xaplq,null,1429492108,58,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,58

A similar route could easily be followed towards a land locked country like Switzerland. But Switzerland isn't the only problem. There are nations who enable tax evasion all over the world, and there are others in the EU. Belgium has a tax system as dispicable as the one in Switzerland. It's a system that attracts huge corporations from all over Europe that allows them to evade millions of euros of tax. Now, every country is allowed to democratically decide their own tax system for all I care, but because of our globalized economy countries use it simply to fuck with other nations. And that's the root of our problem.

But that doesn't mean we can't do anything outside coercion or military intervention. To prevent tax flight you can restrain free movement of capital. But the best way to prevent tax competition is to tax international business on a unitary basis. This way national authorities can treat related entities as a single unit, with consolidated accounts, combining all the activities of the firm. The resulting unitary tax would then be apportioned between states on a formula based on the proportion of real business done in that state. This would stop companies from conducting fictitious activities through shell companies in tax havens. 

However, not only will this take an international effort, it also needs an automatic exchange of tax information between jurisdictions. But if a country like Switzerland denies to participate, we don't even have to resort to sanctions or hostilities. We can just deny all capital movement to Switzerland. And just like Monaco did, they will adjust their tax system in a matter of days, if not hours.

true,schlork,null,null,"&gt; Taking away wealth gained by ethical means just because someone was more successful than his peers and they want a bail out - not just at all.

It depends on what the alternative is. If dispossession would prevent rampant inflation and the crash of the EU economy, it would probably be in the interest of the wealthy.

And I'm not sure if it's possible for a person to ethically accumulate billions of Euros. Man hours certainly can't justify these amounts of money, so it's usually based on an unconventional business idea. But you simply can't start a business without using all kinds of (often tax funded) established infrastructure nowadays. Amazon would've been stillborn without parcel services, and any parcel service would go bankrupt within days without well-maintained streets and rails.

Of course, Amazon is a great business idea that many people benefit from, and those who invested in it should be heavily rewarded. But what is an appropriate reward? I think it boils down to this: How much personal wealth is necessary for people to have great ideas and work their asses off?

It is however a fact that no relevant economy has ever tackled a deep crisis succesfully without huge reinvestments. And this makes sense, because during an overproduction crisis we are in need of more demand.

Sure it's impossible to become rich without using government infrastructure, but is it really unethical? It's not like theres any alternatives to driving on public roads and using public post service etc.

I think it's impossible to determine the optimal level of compensation, and trying to set it could do more harm than good. On the other hand it's been shown in some research that too high bonuses can lead to worse performance...

And while I'll agree that becoming a billionaire is very hard to do ethically, setting the bar at 1 million seems to low, especially when it concerns people saving up for retirement etc. If someone saved up for 40 years dreaming about traveling the world when he retires, how could we tell him ""sorry we'll be taking that money for bank bailouts, now hope you won't need any expensive medicine procedures or they'll take the rest of it"".

Every european country that has more interest is being less integrated in the EU while being able to apply/integrate more already do so:  
1. Switzerland: they are the de facto financial neutral zone of the whole world. They thrive on not being really part of anything. Liechtenstein goes where CH goes.  
2. Norway: North sea oil and fishing. Expects them to join EU when these two resources becomes scarcer.  
3. UK: the economic dependency on financial services is what makes UK not join the Euro. USA influence is what fuels the general ""anti-EU"" sentiment in UK. UK government has interest in playing the american friend in the EU because of the leverage that can be used into EU.  
4. Belarus: Russian puppet state, nuff said.
5. Ukraine: it has long term interest in joining (it's Europe's farmland) but like UK it's in between EU and Russia.  
6. Russia: massive natural resources (plus huge political reasons, of course)

true,eberkut,EURO,European Union,"&gt; So you are saying, that then will all the EZ countries that disobeyed the rules and got Europe into this mess a) start paying their fines b) obeying rules? Why should they?

&gt; What makes you belive that? How are you going to implement rules when, evidently a majority of the EZ countries, don't give a toss about laws? How can you make sure that they will not behave the exactly same way with the next treaty, or the treaty after that?

I hate repeating myself: because there would be a strong federal administration.

This implies a power beyond member states with common interest at heart instead of member states defending local interests only. This federal administration would have budget and enforcing powers of its own. It would manage wealth transfers and programs meaning it would actually control part of its member states destinies in a way they can't simply ignore it. It would also imply more transparency and democratic controls making backroom deals less likely.

You can dislike the federalist options for many valid reasons but it actually answers your point.

&gt; Do you think it's OK, until then, (to when the EZ countries decides that one should follow the laws) to disobey rules, laws and regulations? Why can't they start now?

I never say that it's OK. I'm as disappointed in member states as you are. You already know why they don't start now: because virtue is rarer than egoism. The same reason we have states as the national level or why anarchy doesn't really work.

&gt; Also, to write that new treaty will take years, and might not even go through, if they do it democratically. Do you think it's OK to do what they are doing now, rushing it undemocratically forward? Should a constitution be implemented undemocratically?

I also never said that. I would have preferred the 2003 Convention for the Future of Europe had been a true constitutional convention. There was no desire for this at the time for many reasons and now we have to save what can be.

&gt; Can Finland just choose not to listen to the next treaty?

Finland can choose whatever it wants. If it's such a painful thing to be part of the EU, the Lisbon Treaty has provisions for leaving the union.
