I don't want to be forced to make a pronounced statement, you're trying to garner opinions from me that aren't my own to make a biased sample in that case. You're not accurately representing my opinions with your survey. 

Economically wealthier people should be taxed more as they have more disposable income, a poor person might be taxed at a rate that will significantly affect their purchasing decisions whereas a wealthy person will only be taxed at that rate at a very very high tax rate. But the fact that a person may have been born with something is not applicable. You're just trying to marginalize certain forms of wealth, old money is bad, new money is okay because it's not talked about.

Everyone's happy; religious people can still marry according to the rules of their religion and the irreligious are not be discriminated by the state (people in religious unions would simply be seen as individuals by the state). People who want to live in less ""traditional"" unions (by Western standards) can simply do so without discrimination from the state (once again, they're just treated as separate entities).

Parentage is first of all determined by the genetic make-up of the child (easily solving the problem of &gt;2 parents, as the recent research brings us close to the possibility of having 3 biological parents; also regulating surrogacy). Parents already have the right to transfer their parental rights and responsibilities to another entity (person(s)/state) through adoption, these rules don't need changing. If the biological parents split and the new partner wants the parental rights and responsibilities and one of the biological parents doesn't, they simply transfer the child to them. This is nothing new.

A man is not automatically responsible for the child of his female partner unless he is a genetic parent of said child, unless he chooses to do so, and becomes a legal parent if a genetic parent transfers their rights and responsibilities to him. Men do not become fathers by the simple virtue of being named the father by the mother, although a simple declaration is just fine and genetic tests are not needed, unless someone contests said declaration within a specified time frame, roughly the same way it's done today (today parents simply sign a piece of paper that says ""we declare we are the parents of the child"" and that should be enough). If a person refuses to declare themselves a parent, a genetic test is needed. If a person is not declared a parent but believes they should be, once again a test is needed.

Parents (biological or legal) are simply ""parents"". Numbers are not needed; people have names. If the parents have identical names, they have usually already figured out a way to label themselves unambiguously (e.g. a number issued by the state like the National Insurance number or PESEL or what have you). The labels ""mother"" and ""father"" are *tolerated* by the state, but all legal documents uses the terms ""parent"", ""parents"" or simply the name of the person concerned. For example, an agreement form for a school trip or for a medical procedure asks for the signature of a parent.

Here are some recommendations from the top of my head:

* [Fassbinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Werner_Fassbinder), the great German director: Berlin Alexanderplatz (based on the novel), Welt am Draht (science fiction), ...
* Werner Herzog: Aguirre (but original language is english), Nosferatu, Woyzeck, Fitzcarraldo, Mein liebster Feind
* Loriot (German Comedian): Ödipussi, Papa ante Portas

Other movies

* If you are a computer geek: 23
* Lola Rennt
* Die Blechtrommel (based on the novel)
* Laß Jucken, Kumpel. The best known of the German Sexfilm Genre (sex film)
* Die Brücke

If you are into crappy B movies then there is a whole genre of German underground horror movies like Violent Shit and Nekromantik. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_underground_horror

The German Edgar wallace movies are also fun to watch but not really good movies: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Wallace_movies

----
Prior to the end of WWII

* Propaganda movies: They are Nazi propaganda so be aware! But they are still interesting in a film historical sense as long as you don't try to derive political ideas from them: Kolberg, Triumph des Willens
* Das Blaue Licht
* Die Feuerzangenbowle
* Fritz Lang: Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse, M, Metropolis (silent)
* Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari (silent)
* Nosferatu

Außerdem: Andreas Brandhorst - Kinder der Ewigkeit.

so it turns into a gamble if it works fine, if it won't you are doomed in a vicious circle. sure there are examples where things worked out fine, like brazil. but the way i see it most politicans just use increased debts because it's the most comfortable solution for them. this solves problems in the short term run, maybe enables them to be reelected but i often times doubt that it is a resonable long term strategy if you dont even manage to get right of the debt during boom times.

There's absolutely no need to stop heterosexual couples declaring themselves 'mother' and 'father' except for weird misguided notion that if they were allowed to describe themselves that way then gay parents would somehow be less. So you prevent that by making a pretence in legally recognised official forms.

Heterosexual couples can still define themselves as ""mother"" and ""father"". The issue is that, in the legal framework of family law, you have to handle all cases equally, or else there will be discrimination. So in the legal sense, we are all parents.

The name that shows up on the pre-printed administrative forms is a minor concern. As a genderqueer gay (biological) male, I prefer ""parent"". I'm sure many straight couples prefer ""mother"" and ""father"". I'm sure many gay couples prefer ""father"" and ""father"" or ""mother"" and ""mother"". But when it comes down to it, this just isn't very important.

But as for birth certificates, it _is_ important that they be accurate. The easiest solution there is to just have it say ""parent"". Another way would be to have three different forms, with the three different ""mother"" and ""father"" combinations.

As for Iraq. Iraq was... weird. I still don't know what happened there, but Osama Bin Ladin was the figurehead for 9/11, not Saddam, and he was alive and well despite there being no evidence of WMDs in Iraq. People were gunning for the man that spearheaded an attack on America's innocent civilians, and our involvement in Iraq didn't really change that desire to bring justice to America's biggest terrorist.

That said, your objections don't exactly contradict why we might respect those who enlisted at those times. People can look at Afghanistan and Iraq and know they're in for a world of shit, but we certainly don't blame them for that. People can enlist thinking they're being stationed in Japan but end up getting reshuffled to the middle east, but we certainly don't blame them for that, either. It doesn't particularly matter why someone wants to enlist, but at the end of the day, their service means they volunteered to do something so the rest of us didn't have to. We thank them for doing the dirty job that the rest of us don't want to, and subjecting themselves to incredible hardship so the rest of us didn't have to.

Also in Trapani is Marsala - famous for Marsala wine.  There are a lot of places that specialize in agro-tourismo where you can stay in a villa, loft or room right on the vineyard for short money.  Some googling on this would help.

Palermo is very nice (where I live).

20 minutes outside of Palermo is [Terrasini](https://www.google.it/search?q=terrasini+sicily&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zrx5UJ_5DcXgtQay4YBI&amp;ved=0CAsQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1568&amp;bih=908) with a famous piazza and ocean drive.  Very nice to visit and doesn't cost much at all.

But as for most beautiful and recognized, it would have to be [Taormina](https://www.google.it/search?q=taormina+sicily&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w7t5UPiyCY2yhAeqsIHYCw&amp;ved=0CEkQsAQ&amp;biw=1568&amp;bih=908).  I've stayed there myself and although you always pay tourist prices, it's worth the stay.  Just a gorgeous place.

I've been visiting Sicily for 10 years before my family and I moved here.  We've never been robbed or pick pocketed.  I've always felt safe.  The people here are the warmest, like to talk and are usually curious about tourists.  But like any city, don't flash cash around in the open and don't look like a target.

One other thing, you're coming in October as things begin to quiet down but wherever you go, search for local festivals or celebrations that are happening.  They are a great time and give an excellent opportunity to experience local culture and food.

true,nobb,null,null,"&gt;ce n'est pas l'esclavage en général qui est montré du doigt mais l'esclavage pratiqué par les européens et les américains.

Je pense que la principale raison c'est que c'est le seul qui a laissé derrière lui une population distincte d'ancien esclaves aussi importante. Je subodore que les populations d'esclaves de la traite orientale ou intra-africaine soit sont mort a la tache si ils travaillait dans des mines par exemples soit ce sont lentement intégrés a la population si ils travaillait comme domestique. en tout cas, c'est pareil pour de nombreuse civilisation qui pratiquait l'esclavage, comme les grecs, les romains ou les danois : aujourd’hui il y a plus de groupe ethnique correspondant au esclaves.

Du coup, c'est pas non plus absurde que les critiques qui émerge des populations issue de l'esclavage se dirige essentiellement vers les nations directement responsable, surtout quand il s'agit de parler de réparations concrètes et pas de condamner l'esclavage en général.

&gt;une certaine version de l'histoire héritée je pense de la guerre froide où un ""ouest"" nébuleux est responsable de tous les malheurs du monde.

Le problème, c'est que c'est quand même un peu vrais, on peut pas nier qu'il y a eu un passage imperialiste de l'histoire ou les européen (pas que eux, mais principalement eux) ont envahis le reste du monde, d'abord les deux Amériques (provoquant la disparition de pratiquement toutes les cultures locale, quoique essentiellement par la maladie), puis l’Afrique et enfin une bonne partie de l’Asie. Et c'est aussi vrai que les territoires ainsi colonisé ont été organisé essentiellement pour l'extraction de ressource sans considération particulière pour les autochtones.(un exemple parmis cent, l'organisation des réseau férré en afrique est construit sur un schema d'extraction de ressource assez violent, ce qui donnent [les ligne des chemin de fer en dents de peigne](http://filipspagnoli.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/africa-railway.gif)).

En fait c'est un peu comme les allemands aujourd’hui. je pense que personne d’à peu prés raisonnable tient la génération actuelle responsable du nazisme mais personne en Europe (et ailleurs ) ne le supporterais si ils essayaient de minimisé ou de passé sous silence ce passage de leur histoire. la colonisation et l’impérialisme c'est pareil, il y a pas a se sentir spécialement coupable, mais c'est odieux d'essayer de nier ce qui c'est passé (notamment tous les courants nauséabonds sur les bienfait de la colonisation).

&gt;Il est maladroit et très périlleux sur le long terme de continuer à enseigner une version unilatérale de l'esclavage dans des sociétés multiculturelles et multiraciales comme la notre. Mais bon j'imagine que dans des classes où parler des croisades ou de la shoah est devenu impossible, il serait tout aussi illusoire de vouloir parler des marchés aux esclaves 

après avoir regardé les programmes de [collège](http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid81/les-programmes.html#Histoire-g%C3%A9ographie-%C3%A9ducation_civique) et de [lycée en seconde](http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid52692/les-enseignements-nouvelle-seconde.html) , il me semble que l'enseignement de la shoah est toujours la (en troisième) et si ça a pas trop changé depuis mon époque, les croisades doivent être abordé en cinquième, notamment en lien avec la renaissance. 

Mais le vrais problème, c'est que c'est extrêmement dur de faire un programme d'histoire satisfaisant pour aux moins deux raisons. la première c'est la contrainte de temps : il n'y a simplement pas le temps pour aborder plus qu'une poignée de sujet de façon pas trop superficiel. on pourrait remplacé tout les enseignements par de l'histoire et a la fin il y aurait encore d’innombrable choses digne d’intérêt à apprendre.

La deuxième raison, c'est l'histoire pour quoi faire? Est ce que le but c'est d'enseigner les principales mouvements qui on marqué l'histoire du monde (il faudrait parler de Gengis Khan par exemple), ou d'essayer de donné les clefs pour analysé le monde moderne (mais personne n'est d'accord sur comment analysé le monde moderne, et est ce qu’apprendre les principales réserves de pétroles dans le monde est prioritaire par exemple?), ou construire notre identité de français (et qu'est ce qui nous définit comme français? la non plus tous le monde n'est pas d'accord. Est ce que connaitre par cœur le nom de tous les rois de France c'est pertinent?) ou d'européen. et il y a encore d'autre questions qui sont cruciale : est ce qu'il faut se focalisé sur les individus ou sur les population pour décrire l'histoire? (par exemple, dans la révolution haïtienne, quel rôle donnés a Toussaint Louverture et quel role a la population en generale?), est ce qu'on enseigne des suites de fait de façon chronologique ou on essaie de mettre en relation des evenements pour en decrypter les méchanismes? est ce que l'on souligne les points commun et recurent de l'histoire, ou on insiste sur la particularite de chaque situation? est ce qu'on essaient d'organisé les fait pour montré une idée de progrés de l'humanité ou on insiste sur les vas et viens de la condition humaine? et ainsi de suite.

Toutes les positions précédentes sont défendable, et l'histoire a l’école est un gros compromis sur toutes ces positions. c'est a la fois pas terrible et sans doute une des meilleurs solutions, parce que le mélange des points de vue prépare mieux un esprit critique qu'une ligne directrice unique, aussi brillante soit elle. l'histoire a l’école n'est pas conçu comme le bagage minimum du citoyen, mais comme le marche pied vers un approfondissement du sujet tout au long de la vie. 

&gt;Il n'y a pas eu ce genre de mouvement sociétal en orient à ma connaissance. L'esclavage à grande échelle à été stoppé par la colonisation française/européenne au maghreb et en Afrique. A l'est la chute progressive de l'empire ottoman face aux tsars russes et aux puissances occidentales durant le XIX et le début du XX° siècle. 

C'est pas entièrement vrai (j'ai pas le temps de tous verifier et ce message est deja bien trop long), par exemple l'empire Ottoman a aboli l'esclavage [en 1847 ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzimat), avant les états unis, dans le cadre d'une série de reforme de modernisation du pays. j'ai bien des difficultés a trouver des info sur le sujet, donc si tu as des sources, je suis preneur.


Pour conclure, j'ajouterais que le manque d'information sur la traite orientale peut etre aussi vu sous un autre angle : l'eurocentrisme. On n'en parle pas parceque d'une façon générale on ne parle pas des choses qui ne nous concerne pas directement ( exemple extrême, on ne nous enseigne rien sur l'histoire de l’Allemagne entre la séparation de l'empire carolingien et le nazisme.

Secondly, the privatisations have not been successful across the board. In a lot of the cases it has simply turned into a moneymaking machine for the market, leading to higher prices and worse service for the population. I do agree that privatisations can be a really good thing, but they're not being pragmatic about it but it happens on a ideological basis. It's not good for Sweden in the long run.

Also, the way that they deal with poverty (which means immigrants, to a large degree) is going to become a problem. We have had increasing social unrest in these groups, and lowering taxes has not generated more jobs. The model for learning immigrants Swedish is really flawed too, which certainly doesn't help. These groups feel discriminated against, and even if it wasn't the intention it's becoming a bigger and bigger problem.

Another huge problem is how they've reduced the disability services, and trying to get people back to work by force. The idea was that it should be combined with rehabilitation efforts, which is a good idea, but it hasn't been implemented nearly as often as it should. This leads to a pretty oppressive disability strategy, and sick people finding themselves in poverty. It may be possible for a good portion of the people on disability to work if they find work that caters to their disabilities, but these jobs don't seem to materialise. So you get part time unemployment instead. These policies need to be refined quite a lot, especially improving the incentives for employers to employ part-time disabled people.

I feel that much of the economic gains from these policies are essentially a kind of piggy backing on selling out public property and are of a transient nature and they will lead to less efficiency much greater inequalities in the long run.

Just use common sense - can not policies set in place over the course of 6 years affect a society?

true,diehard3,null,null,"The article claimed that IT in Europe alone was 374 bln EUR:

&gt;  To translate this into savings, the researcher draws on estimates for the total value of the IT sector. Industry groups and analysts estimate this to be between 374 billion and 399 billion euro.

For me this spells out to ""the IT sector in Europe is 399 bln"" vs ""According to market researcher DataMonitor, the size of the worldwide software industry in 2008 was US$303.8 billion"". 

Now, IT isn't only software, but it's a joke to assume savings from open source larger than the size of the entire software industry.

And to claim gains from ""better quality"" and confusing stuff like ""the costs for reused code is about three-fifths that of traditional code"". What does ""re-used code"" has to do with it?

There have been larger OS projects like the LiMux project (Munich city uses open source since 2008, migration will be 80+% complete next year). Savings have been around 25% in license costs (25 mln over 5 years so far).

http://www.opensolutions.net/home-news/newsansicht/stadt-muenchen-spart-durch-linux-rund-ein-viertel-an-it-kosten/e93fb675b8ceb8948d58caf3b5bf5fb4.html

Given that licenses are not *that* huge a deal (manpower is way larger), you can extrapolate their figures to 450 bln savings * 4 = 2 trln originally for licences. Then say licenses make up 25% (no idea what it actually is, maybe around 5-10%) of IT costs we get 8 trln/year for IT in Europe.

If you think that's realistic be my guest. But then I might have a bridge to sell somewhere that is a real bargain, too. Just in case you're interested.

My guess is that they simply confused millions with billions. That would be immediately believable and would look realistic, maybe a bit on the low side. And utterly unremarkable as, you get stuff free you normally pay for and save some money... who'd have guessed...

true,IamBulgariaAMA,BULG,Bulgaria,"Hello,

Let me start out by saying it straight - I completely disagree.

Judging by your post, you seem a bit bitter, because most of the stuff you wrote seems very biased.

I've actually worked in Technologický Park and lived in Brno for a year.

I most certainly do not agree with the comparison to Bangalore - Brno is actually quite a nice city, it has a great combination of old/historical buildings and monuments and a very vibrant and cool atmosphere, largely due to the fact that a very big part of the population there are students. As far as I remember there's about 100 000 students there year round, so night life is also big there. Brno is a lot like most cities in that part of Europe - same as Bratislava, Vienna and Prague - it combines modern and historic sites quite well.

I can't talk about rents in Prague, but let me just say that I shared an apartment which was literally a 5 min walk from the center of the city (Náměstí Svobody) and a 10 min. tram ride to my office and rent run about 300 EUR each. While this is a bit more than my colleagues paid in other parts of the city, our apartment was big and the location was absolutely phenomenal and well worth the extra cash.

I cannot compare the price of public transportation with other parts of the Czech republic since I only spent my time in Brno, however what I can most certainly say is that you could actually set your watch to the bus/tram schedule. Trams and buses were most definitely not from the 2000's, however they were always on time. Also, there was night transport starting from the city center every evening, running every hour and travelling to all parts of the city. Now this might be standard in larger western European cities, but I would not call such a city 2nd tier when even public transport is made so convenient for its citizens. 

I am not sure where you worked and lived, however, walking that distance only makes sense if you wanted to go for a walk, transportation was plenty in my time over there.

Out of curiosity - Are you originally from Brno? I am sure choices are plenty, especially in Brno itself, there are so many global corporations with distribution centers there, I find it hard to believe choices are limited.

And before anyone calls me out as biased - I actually left Brno as I didn't adapt to the people and culture at the time and did not enjoy my time there. However that takes nothing away from the fact that Brno is actually quite a nice place to live and work in.",0,1350218378,null,0,false,0,c6m9dtu,t3_11gd5k,t1_c6m9dtu,t1_c6m8q09,null,1430144142,15,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,15

Most were acquitted so it must mean there's not much evidence besides one word against another and that's not sufficient when suspects are risking 20 years in prison. Some were even acquitted after the prosecutor admitted they had nothing and thus asked the court to let them go. This might very well end up as being a huge failure by the police and the prosecutors, not by the judges.

Another point is that some of the accused were minors at the time or barely major. You're not judging the guy who's 30 years old now but the one who was 18 years old then. Indeed, some leniency might come from the fact that more than 10 years after the fact, several accused are married with children and have a job. So even for those actually sentenced, this might explain why they are so lightly punished.

Last point: since the victims were minors at the time, the trial was closed to the press and the public. Also, in France, a Cour d'Assises does not have to motivate its ruling. Because of these two facts, the only way the public might be informed is through the victims and accused lawyers. You're not going to get an unbiased reporting this way.

That Bangalore-feeling is more related to the company atmosphere than to the city itself, but I'm quite certain it's the same in most of other tech companies as well, because only few have their HQs in Brno. All the newsletters and every relevant manager only talks about what's happening in Prague and they have no idea what it's like in Brno, and frankly, they don't care because they don't live there, it's really just something near the freeway. They don't even see the city, when they come, they talk only about how was the journey on the freeway. I imagine it's similar in all companies that have developers in Brno and management and other branches elsewhere. And that's nearly all of them.

Public transit works, but it's really faster for me to walk to home at evening, because after 7 PM, you just wait all the time. Missed connections means waiting another 10 minutes or even 20. If that happens twice, and that's more of a rule than exception, it really gets faster to just walk right away and perhaps take a short hop if something runs nearby. It's also very slow, tram tracks in most of the city are in a bad shape, there are many long sections when the speed is limited to 30 km/h or even less. Insane amount of time is also spent on intersection, only minimum of them with any preference for public transit.

Apartment selection is very limited, especially if I don't want to share the apartment. Unless you want to live in a panelák or some newly built ghetto in Medlánky or whatever. Living closer to work isn't a good option either, because the office is in a terrible part of the city (again, close to the freeway to Prague). The only attractive part of the city (where you lived, I assume) is nearby to the old center, just few streets around Veveří and Kounicova street.

That's all bearable and actually, I can imagine that living in Brno could be OK, if some problems were properly addressed. And most of all, if people cared. I have never seen emptied litter bin in my whole life here. All of them are overflowing. Nobody cares. Ever.

But if I could easily choose to live in a ""first-tier"" European city, why on earth would I stay here?

Non voglio dilungarmi molto perchè è come cercare di spiegare a qualcuno che una porta si può aprire al primo tentativo solo se si legge a priori l'etichetta TIRARE o SPINGERE su di essa.

Per il resto, mi fa sorridere il fatto che viene prestata più attenzione ad un giornale che intasca soldi pubblici in cambio di notizie scritte da giornalisti servi, piuttosto che dare credibilità a qualcuno che faccia da megafono alla parola dei cittadini. 
Beppe Grillo può piacere o non piacere, per carità, ma l'attenzione sul ""chi votare"" va diretta ai candidati del movimento 5 stelle. Sono loro che prendono voti. Non Grillo.

Now, for some context: One of the points GD was making before the elections is how immigrants take state resources that could be used by ""real Greeks"". In their talks they mentioned not only jobs but also that, if elected, they would [go to hospitals and kindergartens to kick out the foreigners]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P9_MquKs2oI#t=116s). 

This same point about stopping the children of immigrants from taking up positions in kindergartens [was also made by current Prime Minister Samaras](http://youtu.be/UGRLLXzRpwA) before the elections. 

Recently, one of the Golden Dawn MPs asked a question in the parliament requesting information about this ""issue"". The government responded by immediately sending the linked document to all kindergartens in order to amass and later aggregate the data. 

Edit: [Lawyer's opinion on whether this is a violation of privacy](http://elawyer.blogspot.nl/2012/10/blog-post.html) (in Greek).

If the market is large enough, surely someone will come up that creates the needed software. If not, chances are that there aren't OS solutions either.

If the market gets larger, more competitors come up that drive prices down. So you can't point at - say - Apache and claim that you save 10 mln licenses for Windows NT Server or whatever. Eventually someone will pop up that creates an alternative.

Apart from that: the cost of developing the software is more or less the same. It's not like these are all saints waiting to do some code. A lot of times, the software is developed on company time because they needed some features that weren't present before.

So the size of the software industry is directly correlated with the savings in open source - all you save are license costs. You still have to pay for support and customization.

Why not go ahead and name them, then?

If the prize was renamed, and stripped of all references to Alfred Nobel, it wouldn't breach any trademarks. And who would hand it out, if not Norway? Sweden? why would that be better, and wouldn't that be in direct contradiction to Nobel's will as well?

Finally, do you really think the peace prize would be better, just because it was less controversial? there are literally hundreds of peace prizes out there that no-one's ever heard about.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I think that the problem with the people on the lists you linked to is that while som of them might be worthy to recieve the peace prize, they would not actually be eligible to recieve it if we are to take Nobel's will literally. In fact, many people like that have already won the peace prize , it's just that no one remember them. 

Well, the point is that you can still find receipiencts, that is was mattered (I googled for five minutes, I am sure with a bit more effort one can find people,  or do you honestly believe there are none out there? )

Also, the point of the will was to recognise people, help them. Not that the individual receipient was to be remembered for decades.

&gt;If the prize was renamed, and stripped of all references to Alfred Nobel, it wouldn't breach any trademarks. And who would hand it out, if not Norway? Sweden? why would that be better, and wouldn't that be in direct contradiction to Nobel's will as well?



What? Well, of course you can do that, if you want. I can also start a competition every fourth year in memory of the greek olympic games and call it something else, but it still wouldn't be the Olympic games.

Are you saying that the Norweigans will start handing out ""Stortingspriset"", and that will dominate over  the newly founded committee who stills hands out the same old Peace Price, it is just decided by other people? Do you truly think that will happen? 

Just because the Norweigans can't handle it, it doesn't mean that the price ceases to excists. Why would it? 

According to Nobel's will, I *think* he wanted the Norweigans to handle it, but I think it was a wish, not a directive. If the Norweigans can't handle it, I don't see why Sweden can't form a Nobel Peace committee, just like we have with physics etc, and hand it out with the other prices.

&gt;Finally, do you really think the peace prize would be better, just because it was less controversial?

Why would it become less controversial? No one says that, we do not know who will receive it. 

You do not seem to get it, the point is that the Nobel Peace Price is supposed to be handed out in accordance with the will. Whether you or I like it or not is irrelevant. You just can't ignore the testament.

It's not high acceleration, it's 1G. You can pull more than that stopping suddenly in a race car.

Are you claiming that the Norweigan Peace Prize committee are following the testament? Yes or no? 

Do you even understand the argument? 

The thing is that all wills in Sweden fall under different Länsstyrelse in Sweden, depending on where the person died. In Alfred Nobel's case, it happens to be Stockholm. So, Länsstyrelsen is ultimately in charge of the will- do you agree,or not? 

Then, they have authorised the Nobel Prize committee, to implement it. If they do not implement it correctly, Länsstyrelsen have to intervene, and (I think, law is not my strong suit) and ultimately it will be decided in Förvaltningsrätten, if they take it so far. 

So, the ones who decide this things are lawyers and courts in Stockholm, not me, and not you. 

So far your arguments has been that the Nobel committee had looked at it and it was wrong, even though the Nobel committee doesn't decide, then you argued that the will is old fashioned and there are absolutely no receipients in the whole world. Now you are trying to make it in to a Swedish / Norweigan thing. It isn't. Had a Swedish committee made the same choices as Jaegerland et al, Länsstyrelsen would have said the same thing, since they are not interested in nationality, they care whether the will is being followed or not!!!

Get you facts right. Sweden is not in the position of removing the prize from the peace prize committee, Länsstyrelsen is, if it is taken to court.

If you had bothered to read, I also wrote that it was probably not very likely that it would be removed,but a stern warning would suffice. In answer to your hypothetical scenarios, I said, that a new committee could be formed, and it could be handed out elsewhere. 

The fact is, you are refusing to accept that the committee is not following the will, or even the spirit of it, and then the authorities are  required to act.

If the number was 20%, then this number would reflect the number of non-EU immigrant families. If you multiply the number of existing non-EU immigrant families by 10, it's easy to understand that Greece, an EU country, would be taking in more non-EU immigrants than an EU country could handle, in proportion to its population. The impact in Greece's social cohesion would make all lectures about democracy redundant. Far larger countries struggle with smaller numbers of non-EU immigrants, as a percentage of their populations.

Kenan Malik put it beautifully recently.

http://kenanmalik.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/what-is-wrong-with-multiculturalism-part-1/

&gt; Part of the problem in discussions about multiculturalism is that the term has, in recent years, come to have two meanings that are all too rarely distinguished. The first is what I call the lived experience of diversity. The second is multiculturalism as a political process, the aim of which is to manage that diversity. The experience of living in a society that is less insular, more vibrant and more cosmopolitan is something to welcome and cherish.  It is a case for cultural diversity, mass immigration, open borders and open minds.

&gt; **As a political process, however, multiculturalism means something very different.  It describes a set of policies, the aim of which is to manage and institutionalize diversity by putting people into ethnic and cultural boxes, defining individual needs and rights by virtue of the boxes into which people are put, and using those boxes to shape public policy. It is a case, not for open borders and minds, but for the policing of borders, whether physical, cultural or imaginative.**

&gt; The conflation of lived experience and political policy has proved highly invidious.  On the one hand, it has allowed many on the right – and not just on the right – to blame mass immigration for the failures of social policy and to turn minorities into the problem. On the other hand, it has forced many traditional liberals and radicals to abandon classical notions of liberty, such as an attachment to free speech, in the name of defending diversity. That is why it is critical to separate these two notions of multiculturalism, to defend diversity as lived experience – and all that goes with it, such as mass immigration and cultural openness – but to oppose multiculturalism as a political process.",0,1350247135,null,0,false,0,c6mf4h9,t3_11gsg1,t1_c6mf4h9,t1_c6meqgm,null,1430146931,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

My studies are in immigration and I have been influenced a lot by writers such as Didier Bigo in these issues. There is a brilliant article of his, a whole theory that he calls ""Governmentality of Unease"" (influenced by Foucault and his notion of governmentaility and the pan-opticon which Bigo sees as a *ban*-opticon of the modern Europe), an analysis that sees the bigger picture of things, that has to do with the very notions of perceptions of nationalism and citizenship but also of practical things like the political game and the industries of military equipment for control and surveillance.

Yes, at least in spirit.

The Länsstyrelsen part:

I'm sure you're right with regards to the will. A nitpick: Nobel died in Italy.That changes nothing legally, of course.

But the lawyers and courts can't legally prevent the peace price commitee from handing out the peace price. What the courts can decide, is if the name of Alfred Nobel will still be associated with the peace price.
If they decide to disassociate the name from the price, he consequences are likely to be quite a clusterfuck and would indeed turn the whole thing into a particularly nasty Swedish/Norwegian thing.

&gt; So far your arguments has been that the Nobel committee had looked at it and it was wrong, even though the Nobel committee doesn't decide

I have no idea what you're trying to say here, you must have over-edited this part.

&gt; If you had bothered to read, I also wrote that it was probably not very likely that it would be removed.

Agreed. I doubt anything will actually happen, it's just the usual talk.

&gt; Get you facts right. Sweden is not in the position of removing the prize from the peace prize committee, Länsstyrelsen is, if it is taken to court.

Yet it is only in Sweden and the Swedish press that people are arguing that the peace prize should be handed out elsewhere. I'm not trying to turn this into a pissing contest. I'm saying that behind all this talk of Nobel's will, it's already a pissing contest in fancy clothes, which will progressively turn more nasty if the case develops further.

&gt; The fact is, you are refusing to accept that the committee is not following the will, or even the spirit of it

That's right, just as it is a fact that you refuse to accept that the committee has followed the will, or at least the spirit of it. Or to put it differently, we disagree.

2a) The ministries asked the local administrations during the summer holidays. It was forgotten/ignored/backlogged/ithappensduringthesummerwhateverthefuckyouwanttonameit until GD's MP's new question, written this time.

2b) The government might thought that it would go away, but they were again reminded of their obligation following the written question, hence the chain of urgency in the requests following that.

I know where Nobel died, changes nothing. It is where his will is registered. Also, if you do not follow that will, you do realise that the implications are that testaments do not have to be followed in Sweden. The law is Sweden, like any country, doesn't make an exception for the fact that he was rich and it is now a famous prize. Thus, the consequences for not following is far reaching. 

Of course Sweden is writing about it. What do you expect? Länsstyrelsen in Stockholm is threatening legal actions, it would be a poor journalist who didn't write about it. Do you think they should not, that the Swedish journalists shouldn't report it, or that Länsstyrelsen shouldn't care if testaments are being followed? 

You obviously think that the will is being followed, but the point is, Länsstyrelsen doesn't and ""nowhere"" does the testament talk about ""spirit of the testament "". I have no idea where you got that from, and is certainly nothing Länsstyrelsen should listen to. Could you please link to where in the testament it says ""disregard my earlier wishes and think of the spirit of the will"". Both you and I know there are worthy recipients out there. So, as far as the will goes, Länsstyrelsen is to make sure it is being followed, not ""the spirit""(certainly not a Swedish legal phrase I recognise, but then again, I am not a lawyer). 

Oh, and as far as Reddiquette goes, I just loved what you wrote about Sweden before

I just wish you would recognise that the testament is not being followed, it is not a Swedish conspiracy, there is no such thing as ""spirit of the will"" legally, and no, one can not continue to hand a Nobel prize if one looses the right, although one would certainly be able to create a new one.

&gt; After the genocide we survived in two world wars because we were on the right side of the international community, Serbia and its national interests do not deserve to be treated unfairly today because Serbia has always been on the side that fought against fascism

&gt; Those who lost their lives here were innocent victims, they gave their lives for the new Europe and the EU is now conditioning our entry by saying that we have to allow what started in WWI and WWII to be finished and that it is to shrink Serbia as much as possible,

&gt; Serbia is not asking for anything and you should not give anything to it. Serbia deserves to be a part of Europe because it was creating Europe here as well. That is why by remembering and not allowing the darkness of history to engulf this we are proving our desire to fight for ideals of freedom, equality and respect

&gt; If the Draginac victims were members of some other nation, legends and stories would have been told about them and that is why Serbia needs to insist that its dead must never be forgotten

&gt; We need to forgive those who committed the crime but we cannot forget or accept that their victims are more valuable than ours

&gt; It is important to know who was on which side. We were on the side of truth and justice and we expect those on whose side we were on to be on the side of truth and justice when it comes to Serbia

The peace prize committee has *never* followed the literal interpretation of Nobel's will, but it is only the last couple of years this has been an issue. So the question is why now? If Länsstyrelsen wanted to make an issue over it, they could have made it already the first time it was awarded to the founder of red cross. Von Ossitzky, Borlaug, Dailai Lama, Tutu, Menchu, Madela/De Klerk, Belo/Ramos-Horta, Hume/Trimble, All the organizations who ever got the prize. None of these were directly related to fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. But there were no complaints from the Nobel Foundation or those who adminstered the will of Nobel back then. So there is a precedent. That is what I mean by spirit of the will. 

So Länsstyrelsen will have to argue convincinly in court that the way the will is not being followed to the letter now is different from the way the will is not being followed to the letter in the past. The argument that the peace prize comitte has completely disregarded Nobels will would be hard to prove, and in any case, it was explicitly stated in Nobels will that selection of laureates would be selected by a independent committee selected by the Norwegian parliament, so Länsstyrelsen have no legal mandate to control the selection of laureates directly, nor institute a different selection process for the committee members.

The last bit proves that you really do not care about the testament or actually even understand it. Switzerland can't hand out it. It was also rather rude and dismissing, so I figured you were not knowledgeable nor interested in a serious discussion. Therefore, I wrote Fuck you

The fact that things have been incorrect before, doesn't mean that one can't correct them, does it? I do not know why Länsstyrelsen haven't acted before, but I do know that they have brought it up before, but Jaegerland et al do not seem to care. We both know that there are worthy recipients out there, even though you said there were none. It doesn't mean that one will remove the NPP from those who received it before. Above all, I see absolutely no reason why one shouldn't follow the will- none. Why are you stating that one shouldn't. 

Also, I'd like you to answer the question if ( the not legally recognised) term ""spirit of the will"" should go for all Swedish testaments then? I doubt you'd say that, then is the argument, do you think we should make an exception for Jaegerland et al? How would that law look? We do not write laws for individuals, and I doubt Norway does. 

I know what Nobel stated, but Stortinget can not hand out anything connected with the Nobel name, nor will they get a medal, nor money. Why not create a new prize then?

Also, saying one is acting ""in spirit of"" sound much more like Anglosaxan law to me, not Swedish. I am not familiar with Norweigan law, but since it would be decided in Stockholm, the Swedish law is the one to care about.

I doubt that it will come to the fact that Norway will loose the prize, but maybe it will come to a year when it is not handed out. At least, Jaegerland et al should actually start listening. As you said, no one can stop Stortinget from right to left, but it will not be the Nobel Peace Prize.

&gt;I'm already afraid that this might happen in Switzerland as well, and that my family and I will end up in a similar situation.

I understand, I also have some family members thereabouts. However that is always partially a risk when working and living abroad: the sudden change of immigration policies. I agree that host countries should not drastically alter their position for those already there, but that by itself can't limit the enactment of policies that correspond to the will of most of the people. I do think that some kind of retribution should exist though.

A bit like having immigrant communities should not be something that prevents those that stayed in Portugal to enact whatever migration-related laws they deem fit. Saying this because I'm a bit tired of the implied sentimental blackmail every time this issue is debated, as if those that are actually here earning a fraction of the income should somehow be even further penalised.

On oublie aussi de dire que ce sont les européens qui [ont inventé l'abolitionnisme](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_de_l'esclavage#L.27abolitionnisme.2C_un_concept_n.C3.A9_et_d.C3.A9velopp.C3.A9_en_Europe). Est-ce qu'on a le droit de demander des médailles ?

&gt;Du coup, c'est pas non plus absurde que les critiques qui émerge des populations issue de l'esclavage se dirige essentiellement vers les nations directement responsable, surtout quand il s'agit de parler de réparations concrètes et pas de condamner l'esclavage en général.

Comme expliqué plus haut, toutes les nations sont responsables. Simplement personne ne va demander du pognon à l'empire ottoman ou aux pays africains qui eux aussi ont pratiqué l'esclavage, mais qui ne se sont pas développés par la suite. La révolution industrielle n'a pas existé grâce à l'esclavage, mais c'est elle qui a permis à l'occident de se développer. Si elle avait permis l'essor de l'empire ottoman, ce serait à l'empire ottoman que les prétendues victimes de l'esclavage demanderaient réparations.

C'est bien plus facile d'aller chercher des pigeons blancs chrétiens, de leur expliquer que c'est de leur faute même si l'histoire dit le contraire, et que maintenant, comme je suis noir j'ai subi un préjudice donc envoie le fric. La France a commis plein d'horreurs, mais là désolé il va falloir trouver d'autres motifs.

La comparaison avec l'Allemagne et la Shoah n'a pas de sens. C'est comme de comparer un assassinat avec un accident de voiture.

&gt;l'empire Ottoman a aboli l'esclavage en 1847

Oui, mais il le pratiquait depuis beaucoup plus de temps, et chez lui, alors qu'en France hors colonies, depuis l'Édit du 3 juillet 1315, ""le sol de France affranchissait quiconque y posait le pied"". Et dans pas mal de pays autrefois membres de l'empire Ottoman, l'esclavage continue encore aujourd'hui. On est en plein dans une crise économique, il y a des soulèvements un peu partout, mais il faudrait filer du fric à je ne sais qui (ce n'est pas précisé) pour des raisons qui ne sont pas non plus très claires.

Sinon, je ne vois pas en quoi c'est nauséabond de parler des bienfaits de la colonisation, et je veux bien que tu me l'expliques. Quand tu étudies comment c'était avant la colonisation, pendant, et ce que c'est devenu après il n'y a pas vraiment photo. Comme c'est expliqué [ici](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZtEHZN-OZM), la France a beaucoup investi dans le développement de ses colonies, sans gagner grand chose.

So, if you haven't bothered looking around this political space it's your choice but don't put everything in the same bag because that is the argument of Golden Dawn and that is what they want everyone to believe and the only thing you do is helping them. If you don't support them don't help them. They are a threat to democracy. You might believe it's totally impossible for them to rise to power but probably that's what people thought about Hitler also and probably that's why no one was expecting the military junta of '67 in Greece but a bunch of colonels and some tanks did the job while the rest of society just turned a blind eye.",0,1350287066,null,0,false,0,c6mo5hd,t3_11gsg1,t1_c6mo5hd,t1_c6mgis8,null,1430151243,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
