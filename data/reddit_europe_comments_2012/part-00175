true,Rarehero,null,null,"It's one of the many cities of the Rhine-Ruhr area, a huge metroplitan area with a population more than ten million people and that at includes cities like Dortmund, Duisburg, Düsseldorf and even Cologne. Especially in the ""Ruhrgebiet"", which Essen is more or less the heart of, you often won't notice when you leave one city and enter another one. Yet every city had it's own distinctive feel. What all these cities of the Ruhrgebiet (from Duisburg in the West and Dortmund in the East) have in common is a strong history as coal- and steel industries. These industries are gone today in many places, but that history still echoes around. Yet the area has lot of nature and very diversified landscapes, flat agriculture countryside north of Essen and the ""Bergische Land"" in the South with cliffy mountains (which aren't very high, but can be very steep and create beautiful valleys not far from the big city centres) and many small forests. And the mentioned remains of the industrial history in between, which creates a nice contrast, especially since many of these remains were turned into (open air) museums and/or kept and cared of as ""industrial memorials"". It's really nice, very diversified and and there's lot to discover. Expect to see a lot steel architecture and and old industrial building renovated for business use (I love the contrast of old industrial and modern architecture). 

The history of the region echoes in the population as well. You have a of lot simple minded yet very straight and honest people, many foreigners, but also a strong middle class and a strong upper class as well, especially in the southern parts of the city. Some parts of the city can be quite derelict (but nowhere near the worst parts of cities like Detroit, there are more less no regions you should avoid, not even at night). Most is nice middle class housing and there are many luxury upper class districts. It's not Hamburg or München or Düsseldorf or Hannover though, but that also means that rents are not too high. There are also many good schools and universities like the Folkwang University (congratulations to year girlfriend, it's a good school) or the University of Duisburg and Essen and important service-industries. Essen is also widely known as a good city for shopping. Unlike the USA we usually don't have huge malls (although the Rhein-Ruhr-Center in Mülheim and the CentrO in Oberhausen aren't far away), but pedestrian areas (no cars, open air) enhanced with smaller malls like the ""Limbecker Platz"" in Essen.

Leave your car at home. You won't need it here. There are trains, trams and buses that will take you everywhere.

Things you should do while you are here:

1. Visit the Netherlands, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Aachen, Bonn, Belgium, Münster, the other parts of the Ruhr-area and Niedersachen (Oldenburg is a beautiful city) and maybe even Bremen (beautiful), Hamburg (even more beautiful) and the North Sea. Like a said above, that transportation system takes you everywhere. Make use of it.

2. Visit the ""Zeche Zollverein"". Another fantastic peace of industrial culture is the ""landschaftspark North"" in Duisburg.

3. Visit the Cologne and the Dome. The Rheinpromenade and the Altstadt of Düsseldorf are worth a visit too.

4. Football (soccer) is by far the biggest sport around. Nearly every bigger city has a club in the second or first German division. Even if you are not very much in football, visit a home match of Borussia Dortmund. It's worth it and might change your mind about football.

5. Did I mention to make use of the transportation system and visit as many places in- and outside of North-Rhine Westphalia as possible? 

6. Get a bike and explore the [Route der Industriekultur](http://www.route-industriekultur.de/).

You can explore Essen in Google Street View. For housing I suggest the southern parts of the city (Südviertel, Werden, the closer to the river Ruhr the more beautiful and quiet yet still close to Essen and Düsseldorf).",0,1355064480,null,0,false,0,c7dodx3,t3_14jjvp,t1_c7dodx3,t3_14jjvp,null,1430622250,7,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,7

To Stournaras: Do you believe in any of the projections made for the Greek economy in the latest Eurogroup? Citibank projects 45% unemployment - do you think it might be closer to the truth ?

To Evangelos Venizelos: Your party took 45% in previous elections, now in the polls it gets about 5%. Any self-criticism ? Also, is it true you eat puppies and kittens for breakfast ? 

EDIT: More Love for Venizelos : Do you think when your party put forth a couple of elections ago the rhetorical question ``Socialism or Barbarism'', people understood that you would follow the Barbarism part?

To Alexis Papachelas: Are you still on the payroll of the US embassy ? I hear CIA budgets are down.

1 bottle of red wine  
250ml of port wine

First thing you are gonna do is bring the water to a boil in a small pot and throw in the spices (not the sugar). You are gonna let that simmer for 20-30 minutes. When you are done with that you are gonna sieve out the spices (or use a tea sieve from the start). There should be significantly less water by now so you will not water down the glühwein too much.

Next step you are gonna let the water cool down a little and add in the juice and the peel of the lemon and the orange.

&gt; Peer Steinbrück, 65, who served alongside Ms Merkel during the onset of the global financial crisis, said the chancellor had used Germany’s economic strength to act as Europe’s task master in the eyes of its neighbours.

&gt; “A good neighbour doesn’t do that,” he said, according to the Associated Press. “My main accusation is that Ms Merkel has [led] Germany into isolation in Europe.”

&gt; In a speech launching his campaign before a crowd of 600 delegates in Hannover on Sunday, Mr Steinbrück also called for greater social justice in Germany, a national minimum wage and a renaissance of the social market economy. “Germany needs more ‘We’ and less ‘I’,” he said to roars of approval.

&gt; Mr Steinbrück, a centrist in a left-of-centre party, is a sharp-witted political pugilist whose frank opinions have occasionally attracted controversy. 

&gt; Swiss politicians were famously outraged when Mr Steinbrück compared them to Indians running scared from the cavalry during a dispute over banking secrecy. 

&gt; Mr Steinbrück favours sweeping financial regulation, splitting investment from retail banking – a move that would hit Deutsche Bank, the country’s only real global player.

* Fourth one I'm not so sure about... the front says ""Schuld u. Pflicht vergesset nicht"" (Obligation and duty, don't forget) around the edge, and coming down from the heavens it says ""Alexander sol[l] leben, Gott du wolst geben"" (Alexander will live, God you wanted to give), and finally the fancy thing by the altar says ""Opfere Gott Dank"" (Sacrifice God Thank).  The bottom of the front says ""rein Zinn"" (pure tin), woo hoo.

  The back says ""1772 hat Gott uns in der Hoth erhalten las ferner deine Gnade walten"" (God received us in Hoth (the planet?) in 1772 let your (God's) grace preside over us from far away).

* Fifth one front says ""Der Tod ist in unsere Heuser komen"" (Death has come to our houses) with a cute picture of Death kicking someone's window in.

  The back says ""1772 Das 2. Vierter [sic?] Jahr.  Grosekrankheiten und Sterben. Viele 1.000 [sic?] an Hunger und faulenter [sic?] Fiebern gestorben. Das # Brod[unreadable] in Saken. 16.

Coin #1 you already know.

Coin #3 commemorates the ""Eidgen.(össisches) Sängerfest"" (Swiss singers' festival) in Winterthur on July 16-17, 1854. ""Eidgenössisch"" refers to the foundation of the Swiss confederation as a fellowship bound by oath; Switzerland uses this word as a more formal version of ""Swiss""). 

Coins #2, #4, and #5 appear to be jetons (coins originally used for calculation or counting, but by the time these were made only really for playing) minted by [Johann Christian Reich](http://www.franken-wiki.de/index.php/Johann_Christian_Reich) (link in German) in the second half of the 18th century. Coin #5 specifically says ""DANT."", likely short for DANTES, the name of these jetons from which the modern German word Tand (""toy without value, but kind of cute"", used until the 20th century) originates.

I'll go into more detail about these three. Translations are as literal as possible.

Coin #2 is commemorating the Fürth school for the poor and orphans established in 1728 and gives several other relevant dates; probably minted in 1775 because it says so on the back.

Front:

DER HERR IST VATER DER WAISEN
(""The Lord is the father of orphans"")

PSAL: 62 V 6
(""Psalm 62 verse 6"")

I. C. REICH, F.
(probably short for ""Iohann Christian Reich"", the F if it is indeed an F probably short for ""Fürth"", he lived there and the back of the jeton references this town)

Back:

1728

IN DER FÜRTHER GEMEIN.
(""in the commune of Fürth"", GEMEIN. probably being short for GEMEINDE)

DER ANFANG WAR GEMACHT
(""the beginning was made"")

GOTT SPRACH DAS IA U: AMEN
(""god spoke the yes and amen"", figure of speech referencing 2 Corinthians 1,20 but I have no idea what that means in 1775. U: is a common shorthand für UND ""and"" before we got the &amp;amp; or more modern style of abbreviation U.)

DEN GRUND ZUR SCHUL VOLBRA:
(""the foundation of the school laid"", SCHUL is old spelling for SCHULE, guessing last bit is short for ""VOLLBRACHT"")

1767
(likely saying that the school was built in 1767)

DURCH DER GESTÜFTER NAMEN
(WILD GUESS ""by the names of the founders/donors"", I don't really know the third word with any meaning that fits here but there is a German word ""Stifter"" for founder or donor)

MIT THURN U: UHR GEZIERT 1774
(""adorned with tower and clock, 1774"", THURN is an old spelling of TURM, the German word for tower)

DAS IETZ 3 HUNDERT WAISEN
(""so that now 3 hundred orphans""... not sure about the 3. IETZ is an old spelling of JETZT)

DEN HERRN KENEN PREISEN
(""can praise the Lord"", KENEN ^= KÖNNEN)

DIE WOHLTAT EBIG GRÜNT
(""the good deed shall forever bear fruit"", EBIG being an old spelling of EWIG)
(Edited, the EBIG looked completely different in yesterday evening's light)

SIRA: 41 V 17

1775
(probably indicating the jeton was minted in 1775)


Coin #4 is thanking god that some unnamed disaster is over in 1772. The left figure on the front side looks like it's holding a plow while it's raining, so maybe it's about having enough food again after the famine of 1771/72. I can't make sense of the slanted text front, it appears to be asking god for mercy for one Alexander.

Front:

Around border: SCHULD U: PFLICHT VERGESSET NICHT
(""never forget (plural) debt and duty"", VERGESSET = old spelling of VERGESST)

Slanted bottom to top: GOTT DU WOLST GEBEN
(""God, you may grant"", WOLST being old spelling of WOLLEST)

Slanted top to bottom: ALEXANDER SOL LEBEN
(""Alexander may live"", SOL being old spelling of SOLL)

Bottom left: OPFERE GOTT DANK
(""Give thanks to god""; literally: ""sacrifice ..."")

Bottom: FEIN ZINN
(""fine tin"")

Back:

Left border: 1772 HAT GOTT UNS IN DER NOTH ERHALTEN
(""In 1772, god saved us (when we were) in distress"", NOTH = old spelling of Not; not 100% sure about the 2 in 1772)

Right border: LAS FERNER DEINE GNADE WALTEN
(""furthermore, be merciful"" or maybe ""keep being merciful""; LAS = old spelling of LASS(E))

Center bottom:

I. C. REICH
(short for ""Iohann Christian Reich"")

INVENT.
(sorry, no idea...)



Coin #5 is 2B on [this page](http://www.odophil.ch/numismatik/medaillen/hunger/hunger.html), apparently commemorating the 1771/72 famine in Saxony.

Front:

DER TOD IST IN UNSERE HÆUSER KOMEN
(""death came to our houses"", not 100% sure about the Æ but that's the old symbol for Ä; KOMEN is old spelling for (GE)KOMMEN)

IER:9.21.V
(probably referencing Jeremiah 9 verse 21)

Back:

1772

DAS 2. VIERTEL IAHR
(""second quarter of the year"")

GROSE KRANKHEITEN UND STERBEN
(""widespread illness and death"", GROSE again being old spelling for GROSSE/große)

VIELE 1000 AN HUNGER UND FAULENTER FIEBERN GESTORBEN
(""many thousands dead from hunger and festering fevers"", FAULENTER being old spelling of FAULENDEN)

DAS # BROD (unreadable) 9 K
(WILD GUESS ""one pound of bread costs 9 Kreuzer"", the # being the old pound sign that probably originated in the lb ligature, not sure about the 9, and K being short for Kreuzer, a historical unit of currency, being a guess as well)

IN SAXEN 16 PFE.
(""in Saxony, 16 Pfennige"", SAXEN being old spelling of SACHSEN, PFE probably being short for plural of Pfennig, a historical unit of currency) 

IOH. CHR. REICH
(probably short for ""Johann Christian Reich"")

FEIN ZINN
(""fine tin"")

DANT.

For once, there really weren't that many promises.

So they really didn't have to promise much, except maybe a different way to govern than what has happened in the last 3,4 years under PDL.

About the constitutional changes, there are a couple of important ones on the table:

* related to the structure of the Parliament: one or two rooms, less members (we're getting close to 500 right now).
* a transition towards a more parliamentary republic, as the current semi-presidential one has shown its weaknesses under president Basescu (and not only).
* reorganizing our administrative districts and a move towards more decentralized local institutions.

PP-DD seams to have entered parliament as well. PP-DD is a populist party, centered around Dan Diaconescu, a tv chanel owner/host. His TV channel is the lowest of the low when it comes to quality, and his voters come mainly from the more uneducated segments of society. PP-DD candidates had some of the most incoherent electoral messages I've ever heard, but some people saw them as a 3rd option, an alternative to the two big blocks mentioned above, who had dominated politics until now.

UDMR is the Hungarian minority party, and they used to get a confortable 6-7% in elections. For the first time, they had competition from another Hungarian party on the national level, the PPMT. That ate away at some of their votes, ant they barely made it into parliament as they got a bit over the threshold (and that is a bit of a shocker). Their usual MO is to negotiate with the winning party/coalition and get some concessions for the Hungarian minority. Since 1996 they have either been in coalition with or supported the ruling party (regardless of whether they are on the left or right).

Kebap is big thing here, especially in the Ruhr-Region, and a Kebap-Restaurant with American flair could be very unique and successful, but I really don't know about the entire job-thing. You are allowed to have job, and it's an advantage, that you girlfriend studies in Germany and that you have already graduated (IT would be a big plus), but I can't give you a proper advice. Ask the people in ""r/Iwantout"" or at toytowngermany.com for advice. Teaching a language could be a start (Döner-Restaurants over here are usually small fast food-businesses). And try to get a hang of the language as soon as possible. 

2. I suspect that bikes are more expensive over here. I bought [this bike](http://www.stevensbikes.de/2012/index.php?bik_id=58&amp;cou=US&amp;lang=de_DE) for 700 € a few months ago (a proper entry level-bike by a well known German manufacturer). Good city bikes start around 600 €. Keep in mind that we have stricter (and sometimes outdated) laws over here. No one cares about lights at your road bike as long as you use it during daytime and mainly outside the cities, but for the everyday trips around city you will need (and want) a proper city bike with dynamo light. So yeah, it's pretty much like Copenhagen. And you won't have much fun on the mentioned ""Route der Industriekultur"" with a road bike. It's more for cross- and trekking-bikes. There's plenty of room though for your road bike and you will meet many likeminded bikers.

3. Pretty fast I guess. I've seen 150 Mbit/s and more around here (I still use 16 Mbit/s via cable, which is still fine for me). You have fast DSL everywhere in the bigger cities and moderate prises (internet-flatrate, phone-flatrate and digital TV for like 30 Euros per month). The upload-rates are often a bit disappointing.

4. Um, can't tell. You already are an expert for Döner, and I'm not a big fan of German cuisine. 

5. Quite important if you plan to stay for at least the duration of her studies. And obviously you should take the chance to learn the language. Would be a shame to spend three years or so in a country and learn nothing about the language. Most Germany under and around the ago of 30 speak English quite well, especially in an academical environment. But most employees will request you to be able to speak German, so in the long run you have near to no chance to avoid getting a basic understanding of German. There might be language courses at the Folkwang University (most universities have those).

The truth is that Romanians want to work:

2) I didn't really care for the Eiffel Tower that much, as it was really touristy. The view from the Arc de Triomphe is much better anyway. I also found Montmartre and Sacre Cœur to be really touristy. The Moulin Rouge is not really worth seeing, and it's in a skeevy area.

Avoid wasting time. Don't go see the Mona Lisa if you're really not interested in seeing it. Do the things you want to do rather than the things ""you should do"".

Food. Food is everywhere, depends on what you want to eat. Its winter so its harder/less comfortable to eat outside (I love picnics in Paris), though street vendors carry good food for on the go too. Cafés are an easy way to eat, they have good food (most of the time) and make for a simple sit down. For dinner, there are great places around the city.

Go to a news agents/ book shops in metro and ask for l'officielle du spectacle, it will tell you exactly where there are concerts, the prices and all! Eiffel tower, it's nice but overrated! You will be waiting in the line for hours! Go to the tour de montparnasse, the second highest building in Paris. You will see all of Paris from there, it's indoors and you can go in the roof!

I just studied at Goethe this past summer for 2 months in Munich. 
Honestly, it was a really bad experience for me. My teachers were awful, impatient, and rude women (I took 2 courses back to back, B1 and B2) who made it clear they disliked the fact that I was American. I did make a couple friends, and I met some neat people in my class. My German certainly improved, but I think it was because I was in Germany. 
The apartment they gave me was tiny, the staff was horrible, and there was zero internet. 
Now aside from this, I am not the kind of person who enjoys going out and drinking which is what everyone did. I was also the only English-speaking person in my class which was very hard. 
Basically I was extremely homesick and felt incredibly disconnected from my friends and family back home.
That being said, Munich is a beautiful city! I was able to travel to Amsterdam (GO THERE!!!) and Prague (eh).  I'm going back to Berlin this summer to study with a different program (Inlingua) and will hopefully have a better experience (plus, I'm prepared for the homesick feeling this time).

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Not particularly, no. I can see how you might get the impression that I would, because I keep explaining around here why she does what she does, but an explanation isn't necessarily an endorsement. 

I actually do believe that she's doing an OK job as far as the current crisis is concerned, within the constraints dictated by the political and economic circumstances on the national and European level, and I wouldn't have done much differently if I was in her position (then again, this would be a different situation at home, so the domestic political constraints would be different as well). But that's the thing many don't understand. Practically all the players, not just her, have very little room to maneuver, so much plays out more or less automatically (this may be overstating it a bit, but you get the idea). The way the Eurozone and the EU are structured, how markets work and how the people at large react, has a much greater influence on what kind decisions are made than what the individual politicians might want if they could have everything going their way.  
Maybe it's best to explain it with an unrelated example. Say, you want to build a house. You can't just build anything you'd like. It's not only about cost, you have to deal with building codes and of course you'd want it to be stable. Now somebody walks in and says it would have been better if the kitchen was somewhere else. Well, yeah, it would have been possible, but the upstairs bathroom is right on top of it and having those two separated would have meant more work for the water installation. Or they'd want the living room on the other side and forget that this is the northern end and it wouldn't get much light. It's things like that. Proposals that seem to make a lot of sense when taken by themselves can have consequences that may not always be all that obvious, and especially in a situation like we're in now there aren't always perfect solutions to a problem.

All this isn't to say that she and the others couldn't do a better job, by no means would I want to absolve them of their responsibilities for their decisions. They do have *some* wiggle room, and at the very least they could communicate the basis for their decisions better and be more explicit about their goals for the future (then again, this would affect negotiations...)

If you know Spanish and Portuguese, you could maybe find work as a commercial help for companies who have Spanish or South-American clients.

Working under the table is doable, but most potential clients will frown upon it. If you don't plan on making more than 32k€ per year with your local work, look into the status named ""auto-entrepreneur"" : it is really easy to set up (one online form) and straightforward to use (declare revenues, pay 20% tax, bam, you are legal). However, some limitation may apply depending on your visa if you are not married. It is true that foreigners not declaring their jobs take a big risk.

In Paris, it works a lot through personal business relationships. Speaking French does really help, but it is all about the people you know. If you want to find work quickly, find people who are comfortable with English (they do exist!) and quickly get a network of relations. This is the quickest way to learn French quickly.

American friends told me that there is a simple trick to get Parisians to talk in English : try to speak in French a bit, even a very clumsy French, even with very poor sentence construction. But if you make this effort, most of the people there will be willing to switch to a functional English after two sentences. Just don't start talking in English to French people from the first sentence, that is considered rude.

true,ben9345,ENGL,England,"As far as my minor knowledge of the Qur'an goes killing is OK, and encouraged if it is of people who do not believe after you have offered them a chance to believe. Sam Harris gives many many quotations illustrating that point in The End of Faith and I can't be bothered to find them now but they will probably be on the internet. Now that's not to say that all Muslim's thought it was a good thing;I would hope they have the individual intellectual courage to think outside the context of their faith for their morality (even if it was unconscious) and I know that many if not the majority of Muslims did that and would condemn the attacks but I think its wrong to say categorically that if one were to stick to the texts you would come to the conclusion that 'killing is the greatest sin' or at least that ALL killing is bad. 

That's the difference between passions and religion. Passions do not have a rule book and do not dictate morality to us. We operate with passion alongside our morality and bad things only happen where passion overrides morality. Religion however seeks to dictate morality rather than exist alongside an separate moral law. When people do bad things in the name of religion it may be that they are merely overriding a separate secular morality they had unconsciously but it may also be (and I think in the case of the 9/11 hijackers this was the case given it was not a momentary passionate act but a planned attack) that the actor is acting in line with the religion he/she follows and it is the morality of the tenets of the faith which should be questioned. 

Again you can say the same for Christianity and any of the old world religions and many of the new ones but Christianity has had a renaissance and has had to face the fact that in modern nations people are no longer scared and hopeless because they are better off, healthier and happier and no longer need the consolations of religion to get them through. They've lost ground and can no longer afford to drive home a fundamentalist message and even if they did people would turn to their secular morals instead and would reject it. Islam has not had that renaissance especially in the war ravaged and hopeless middle east and as a result radical messages have more resonance and Islam is therefore more likely to be the source of evil acts in this world.

Strictly speaking, there are separate seats in the Parliament for ethnic minorities -- every officially-recognized ethnic group has a number of seats -- which is why the more hardline nationalists view UDMR's presence as a party as being illegal (especially as it is based on ethnicity) -- I don't remember the exact details of the legislation though, so I'd rather not comment. On the other hand, enough of my compatriots are of Hungarian ethnicity that they can win more seats in the Parliament this way, and most of the parliamentary majorities formed since 1990 have been fragile enough that their 5-8% of the seats allowed them to play a pivotal position -- those 8% were often *the* 8% between the ruling coalition's majority and minority. Needless to say, this made it comfortable for UDMR to follow its agenda, which also resulted in a lot of hostility going in their direction, as they never had any actual economic, real or social agenda -- they openly supported any measure of their coalition, as long as it brought them concessions in favor of the Hungarian minority.

Not trying to scare anybody here, but this avenue is nice in the day-time when it's calm - a very relative notion there of course, but not a good idea at all when it gets overactive. Main reason to avoid is obviously the thugs always hanging around. If you go, you'll see them anyway sitting around the metro entry or on the benches on the avenue (probability: 90%) They're the worst and main factor of the Paris syndrome. In comparison, even the Place du Tertre in Montmartre can be a really cool experience, despite being overcrowded and full of leeches. 

I personnally love the Musée d'Orsay (more or less facing the Louvre, on the other side of the Seine).

The Jardin du Luxembourg is always a great place to visit. And just near to this garden is Saint Michel boulevard, that's full of shops (mainly clothing, but also music, books - Gibert -).

true,haeikou,null,null,"Hmpf, jetzt hab ich ein Posting durch den Back-Button verloren. Mal rekonstruieren:

Simples Erklären finde ich nicht wichtig. Spätestens die Lokalzeitungen bemühen sich um kurze Sätze; nicht jede Zeitung hält sich für die FAZ, und das ist auch gut so. Ich halte das Leseverständnis schon für ausreichend, die Redakteure sind ja auch gezwungen darauf zu achten.

Viel wichtiger finde ich Kontext: Um die kurzen Ticker- oder Agenturmeldungen nicht nur zu verstehen, sondern sie wirklich beurteilen zu können, muss man den Nachrichten ja schon ziemlich hinterher sein. Auch Wochenzeitungen fassen ja nicht zusammen, sondern sie setzen eher voraus, dass man den Nachrichten täglich folgt, und bauen darauf sperrige Diskussionen, mit denen man den sonntäglichen Kirchenbesuch ersetzen kann. 

Deine Zielgruppe möchte vielleicht nur 1-3 mal wöchentlich ein TL;DR der Nachrichten haben, und nicht jeden Abend tagesschau auf youtube gucken müssen, und vielleicht gönnt sie sich sogar den Luxus und klickt nicht halbstündlich auf spiegel online rum. Was machen die? Ich glaube, sie können mit den Online-Nachrichten nix anfangen, so wie die im Moment geschrieben werden. Du musst quasi die zehn unwichtigen, dazwischen liegenden Artikel zusammenfassen, wenn mal wieder ein bedeutsamer Artikel herausgekommen ist, den man weitergeben kann.

Man muss also Kontext liefern. Und damit meine ich nicht Wikipedia-Artikel oder irgendwelche Biografien. Nicht einmal die ersten Absätze der Wikipedia-Artkel sind zugänglich genug. Man muss den Kontext genau auf den Punkt bringen, und exakt jene Fakten nennen, die zur Beurteilung notwendig sind. Ich glaube, das ist weniger subjektiv als gedacht.

Z.B. heutige Schlagzeilen:

* Opel Bochum: Braucht Informationen aus der Zeit der Abwrackprämie
* Flughafenpersonal-Streik: Braucht Informationen über Flugausfälle wegen des Wetters, sowie einen Überblick über die Struktur konkurrierender Gewerkschaften an Flughäfen (wieso streikt da ständig irgendwer?).
* Steinbrück 93.5%: Merkels Zahl dagegenhalten, bisherige Kandidaten dagegenhalten und die Bedeutung dieser Zahl diskutieren. Dann die SPD-Troika erwähnen, und wie es dazu kam, dass wir ausgerechnet Steinbrück oben sitzen haben. (Deiner Einschätzung, die SPD habe die Liberalen als primären Wahlkampfgegner, wird übrigens [widersprochen](http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/steinbrueckinterview102.html).)
* EU Friedensnobelpreis: Mal die letzten fünf erwähnen. Obama hat ja auch einen, das sind ja letztens eher Aussagen über das Nobelpreiskommittee als über die Preisträger.
* Griechenlands Schuldenrückkauf: Muss man Volker Pispers in Erinnerung haben, um das zu verstehen. Aber vielleicht bin nur ich das.

Ich würde also quasi ein Readers Digest machen, und die relevanten Artikel natürlich direkt verlinken (schließlich stehen die ja schon da), aber die Artikel ein bisschen unterfüttern. Das ist letztlich was, was spiegel online längst in ner sidebar unterbringen könnte, quasi Fußnoten, aber die scheinen irgendwie zu teuer zu sein. Das wär dann deine Zusatzdienstleistung.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"Yes, I know about Belgian Congo. Sorry business it was.

But the picture given in Tintin is not one of reality. Herge never went to Congo, he never saw how things were there. Instead, he read French/British propaganda and assumed that things were similar in their part of Africa. The end-result was that Tintin moves around the villages expressing his wishes that he can educate the natives to be great and civilised people among other nations (and taking pleasure in his superior education); he judges some disputes and then goes to safari (which was [rather bizarre event](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kpVW7H-Ag-I/TOrbKzkNZ9I/AAAAAAAAAMw/_qYnyasovnU/s1600/tintin+nosh%25C3%25B6rning.jpg)). 

In short, Tintin is a historical document of not Congo, but of *what Belgians thought of Congo*. 

As he got older, Herge realised what mistakes he had made and edited the book and even replaced pages as he could without changing the story. He didn't STRIVE to be a racist, but it's rather hard to separate what's truly good and what's truly bad when society has such clear views to one way or another. Around the same time he did *Congo*, Herge did *Tintin in America*, where one of the lines of a bank manager (after somebody broke the bank's safe) to a police officer was ""*We moved as quickly as we could, hanged seven niggers -- but the guily party still got away*"". 

But back to *Congo*. As I said, Herge re-edited the book. The natives didn't speak in pidgin any more, [Tintin didn't teach in the school about their benevolent rulers but instead maths](http://opoto.org/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/tintin_congo_gd_ft.jpg) etc. Sure, [the natives act oddly](http://vivirlatino.com/i/2007/07/tintinCongo_big.jpg), but then the Africans did think him as [superstar](http://africasacountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/tintin-in-the-congo-2.png?w=610).. as [did Belgians](http://africasacountry.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/tintin-in-the-congo-1.png). 

But even originally, the book didn't go out of the way to show bad picture of the natives. [This was the original version](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/08/17/nyregion/tintin5.480.jpg) of stereotypical Africans and [this was the redone version](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/08/17/nyregion/tintin4.480.jpg). Sure both versions have their faults, but different kinds (the changed picture tells us of changing stereotypes). 


But should the book be banned? Is it a good thing that they were edited later on to be ""less harmful""?

Sure, if you give the comic book to a kid who just wants a nice story, the kid will like it, no matter what version it is. And he or she would not miss one book among many if it were banned (that is, if it is but one book - all the Tintin books are children of their times, some more than less). 

But children are not the only audience of the books. These days, I'd say that majority (or at least, a large minority) of the readers of those books are adults. Tintin offers great stories in a way that few other books do. They were also the first to be done on the Ligne Claire-style, which became the house style of European comics. Banning the original books made with it would be like banning the first issues of Batman and Superman, the silent pictures of Keaton and Chaplin, all descriptions of Ford T-models etc. You just can't appreciate the things that come after without seeing where it got started. 

And the books are also important for historians and sociologists. They are easy way to check and identify society's views in many subjects (with illustrations, none the less!). 

But perhaps the **MOST IMPORTANT PART** is this; we must know where we are coming from. We NEED those culture shocks to understand how far we have gotten and to inspect our own blind spots. If we edit all the black spots out of our lives and leave them just two or three pages in history books, we understand that bad things were done.. but not what those bad things were or WHY they were bad. The racism in Tintin is completely different from the racism that happened in Congo. if you ban all the old stories set in Congo and only preserve the reality.. yes, you understand that Belgians did horrible things. But you don't understand WHY THE PUBLIC ALLOWED IT. If you read *Tintin in Congo*, you understand why Congo happened. Alone, it might be slightly amusing or somewhat offensive, but together with even one or two pages of history -- it opens the issue before you in a completely new way.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;Now read your last paragraph (which is really well written) and try to image that it refers to children books that contain anti-Jewish racist jokes.

I would not change my opinion. In fact, I *have* read children's book with ""evil Jews"" just to understand the mindset of the 30s. My ""favourite"" is a scifi book where Jews escape WW2 to Mars where they immediately found a bank and stock market to slave the native population (as the heroes find when they follow ten years later). This would have been written in the late 40s, as I recall. 

That it was written in Finland, in a country that had just fought a war where Jewish soldiers did more than their duty, makes the book even more abhorrent. But what should be done? Ban an important part of history, of zeitgeist? Or allow that it happened and we have moved on? A Finn, even a child, of 21st century would not connect Jews with banks and stock markets, and would probably not think of the latter two as instruments of slavery (even as economy is what it is and Gini-coefficient growing larger and larger). He would realize the connection to earlier stereotypes and understand the importance of example. 

In summary, it's really important to read books written for children, for in them adults tell what they want the next generation to hold true.  And not just old children's books, but recent ones as well! They have and reinforce stereotypes as well - other stereotypes, but no less dangerous. Just recently I read about a book where the main character (hero of many best-selling earlier books) finds out that his friend and their family is showing up in a reality tv-show where you have to act like you were poor - winner would get money. How does this treat poor kids who will also read the books? How will it change the children's view of reality TV? On poor people? And so on.

But we are all children of our culture. It's very easy for me to be exited about children's book mocking Jews or African natives when neither is a stereotype that's widely circulated in Finland (there are somalis, but they get racism either because they are black or because they are muslims - not because they are uneducated, which is the point of Tintin-books). The situation would be different if we were talking of a RECENT book with a stereotype that IS relevant for today's Finn. Such as incompetent Greeks, the boisterous Americans etc. I would oppose publishing books like this - but in 30 years, I would probably be enthusiastic that they WERE published. I would jump out of joy to have material to compare the American stereotype of early 1900s to that of 1950s to that of 2010s.

For example Podkarpackie is poor as a region, but Rzeszów (the capital of the region) is quickly growing city, especially in IT sector (biggest Polish and Central&amp;Eastern European IT group - Asseco is from Rzeszów for example).

Similiary in Lubelskie Voivodship - region as a whole is poor, but Lublin as a city is quickly growing (especially in IT and education sectors).

But yeah, the salaries are smaller in smaller cities (even 100% difference between Lublin and Warsaw in IT sector, for example).

I think the main problem of Polish slower-developing regions is infrastructure. For example - Rzeszów got airport a few years earlier than Lublin, and during these years it developed much faster. Now Lublin built airport too (opens this month), and you can already see the effects in more foreign investment.

- urban vs rural: as anywhere in the world, people in cities earn more, have better access to jobs and other helpful institutions. Polish cities left this post-communist-urban-wasteland-in-transition look behind a few years ago. The big cities are considered motors of Polish economy, they are expanding bubbles of civilization and wealth. Polish country - not so much, not everywhere. You still get those villages with defunct state run farms that collapsed after 1989 and nobody found any job for the population working there, so these are now dens of alcohol abuse and social degeneration. That's becoming a rarity, too, forunately, but the more east you move, the more of them you get. Which brings me to another divide:

- east vs west, aka Russian Part vs. everyone else. This thing carries from as long before as partitions of Poland. If you look at the [railway connection map](http://kolej.one.pl/mapy/1/1088025256.png), [NGOs per capita map](http://www.ngo.pl/files/wiadomosci.ngo.pl/public/wiadomosci_foto_2009/podstawowe_fakty_2008_odc2_mapa3.jpg) or [votes for two major political parties map](http://nczas.com/wp-content/gallery/rozklad-glosow-polska-b/rozklad-glosow-polska-b.jpg) you'll notice it's awfully similar to the [shape](http://www.trystero.pl/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/zabory.jpg) of partitions of Poland over modern boundaries. That might let you understand why Poles have that negative attitude towards Russians, if you ever wondered :P. This shape reappears in multitude of maps -- personal income maps, infrastructue density maps, emigration rate maps, all sorts of it.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"OK, I'm going to check that we are on the same page here. You have read the book, right? Or at least other Tintin-books? If you haven't this might be hard to explain.

There were several problems with the first edition (such as Tintin teaching propaganda about Belgium to the kids) that was removed from the new version in the 1940s by the author. In the 80s (after the author was dead), they removed the pidgin that the natives spoke and replaced it with more common language (the quote is from Wikipedia and doesn't reflect the current version on the stores, I think). So yes, the book was seen as racist and steps were taken to adjust to that. You may want to read the [wikipedia-article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintin_in_the_Congo) to see in how the blacks were actually really small part of the story. The main attraction was the local flora and fauna.

You might want to read what I wrote [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14k1hz/tintin_in_the_congo_not_racist_belgian_court/c7e68nv?context=3) on the subject of editing etc.

Now;

Some of the blacks act in strange ways (such as in the panel that illustrates the article), but similar panels are found in all Tintin-books, in majority of them done by white characters. So this wouldn't be racism. 

Then there's the part where Herge was actually [true to life](http://www.okayafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/prince-william-tintin-racist-throne.jpg) but we, living here in Europe don't recognise it as such.

You could say that the characters were stereotypically drawn, but then I would say that this would be just about drawing The Other - Tintin is [everyman](http://agbeat.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/scott-mccloud.png), so he doesn't have any features. To avoid the Africans looking like black everymen, they must have something to separate them from Tintin - and from all the other white characters. Thus the prominent lips (which are actually based in reality as well). This is not racist (black and asian artists do similar things when they decipher white people, who are not ""everyman""). This can be racist NOW, as black people are no longer seen as ""the other"" (and you can see them readily in Europe), but it wasn't then.. and it wasn't intended as such. The clothes may look funny, but those Herge drew from photos.

What have we left? A lot of characters that are somewhat simpleminded from Tintin's perspective (of which he enjoys). This superiority-complex is probably the part which you can say with confidence that is racist - but again, it probably reflects how white people acted toward blacks back then (the main sources for the story were missionaries). Even if the blacks would have acted more smart-like, the interaction wasn't such that it would have been noticed (again, by missionaries). So it can't be racist that Herge draws this - its racist from modern perspective because he doesn't debunk it, show the bad parts.. but how could he? He didn't know the bad parts existed!
 
So, as far as the material for the book allows, THE BOOK ISN'T RACIST. The parts that were there due to interpretation by Herge, were redrawn. But these are moving goals, and the source material was tainted (nothing about plantations and cut hands), and there isn't much that can be done on that beyond what can has been done. But taken on it's own (without knowledge of African culture then and today, without knowledge of other Tintin-books, without knowing how the book was put together) IT IS RACIST IN DISMISSIVE WAY. 

But there aren't really alternatives.. Herge worked within the information he had.

But racism wasn't THE POINT of the book. Killing rhinos with dynamite and meeting and shooting alligators was the point (and that's another can of worms). The blacks were rather small part of the story, as you can tell from the plot synopsis.  

When the judge says that this isn't racist (and you could always dig the whole ruling instead of relying on synopsis of what appears TV-news), he has considered all these points. And even if he in the heart of hearts think it as racist, he may not want to burden the book with questions of bans, re-edits etc. I don't know. 

But you shouldn't feel moral righteousness without thinking about the background.

That would be great, because then interest rates would go down. The reason why those bailout packages and the ECB's bond buying program have become necessary in the first place is that nobody want to buy those countries' debt anymore. 

&gt;  EU banks are also gorging on EU debt,

&gt;  (getting 0.5% rates and buying EU countries at 7% or 20% like Greece)

You know that Greece hasn't sold a single bond in years, right? That 20% value (even much higher than that) comes from the secondary market, i.e., from how cheaply banks sell off the bonds they still hold to speculators just to get them off their books. If my promise to pay the holder of my €100 debt back in ten years gets sold by somebody (who probably had originally payed ~€75 for it) for only €16.15, that's a ""20% interest rate"".

I'm not claiming that the eastern half is the worst, it's just that this is a stereotype the OP asked about.

I'm just saying there is a division -- maybe not a definitive ""pass this border line and you'e in a different country"" kind of division, but A division of some sort.

+ And there's the sewers networks, nicknamed the catacombs, but which are not the ossuary. Granted, some parts of it are part of closed branches of the official Catacombs, but it's mainly rainwater evacuation, old stone quarries and forgotten tunnels. Some building basements connect to these ways, and it goes wide and deep (most of these networks are on the left bank).
    + Don't go there alone. Seriously, don't try.
    + If you find someone who goes down there and who's willing to bring you with him, follow his instructions. Flashlight, old clothes &amp; shoes (the underground is surprisingly warmer than the outside), something to eat… and don't be afraid to get dirty
    + Don't drink down there if it's your first time. Seriously. Being drunk and scared comes before being drunk and lost, which comes just before being dead and lost. Same for drugs and other potent stuff. Supervision by a sober guide is key to not turn up floating in the Seine.
    + Don't paint/draw/engrave over older art. The culture of these undergrounds has been kept more or less a secret for decades, the name you see on this wall might have been engraved one hundred years ago during the siege of Paris, or during the revolution, or, well, yeah. That's part of Paris History. If you really *need* to leave a trace, ask where you could do it.
    + In the ossuaries, don't desecrate the bones. It's simply not done.
    + Be careful who you go down there with, always check that your guide is legit.
    + If you're caught, you're in for a couple hundred Euros fine. There are patrols. Not too often though…

true,ben9345,ENGL,England,"Well, basically I am just repeating verses quoted by Sam Harris but they are referenced and I have no reason to think he's wrong. I looked up a couple on the website you gave:

'They ask you about the sacred month - about fighting therein. Say, ""Fighting therein is great [sin], but averting [people] from the way of Allah and disbelief in Him and [preventing access to] al-Masjid al-Haram and the expulsion of its people therefrom are greater [evil] in the sight of Allah.' 2:217 - 

**In other words disbelief is a greater sin than killing.**

'And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah is worse than killing. And do not fight them at al-Masjid al- Haram until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.' 2:191 - 

**Again it repeats the idea that *'fitnah'* which I think means to tempt a believer away from faith or to shirk your responsibilities as a believer is worse than killing. It also condones killing the case where 'they' attack you. Clearly interventions in Iraq etc could be interpreted as an attack thereby meaning they have to fight against the west.**

The others are [here](https://www.truthdig.com/images/diguploads/verses.html) and most of them are translated in a different way but the meaning is generally the same. You can look around the verses I quoted in the second book and there is a lot of stuff of fighting mostly in the context of conquest of other peoples. The problem with these verse is that they are at the beginning and verses later on that contradict earlier verses are said to overrule the earlier verses. However that's just like Christians saying that the Old Testament doesn't count. However much they say it the Old Testament is still considered a holy text and is still used when they want to use it like when they want to deny science or when they want to condemn homosexuality. In the same way, Muslims who say that the correct interpretation is that killing is not allowed are ignoring the fact that all that stuff is still in the same book and is still used by people to justify violence. That's not passion its just their interpretation of a concrete text. ",0,1355158703,null,0,false,0,c7eadsp,t3_14k02r,t1_c7eadsp,t1_c7e7oe5,null,1430633421,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The reference to §86 in §86a is:
&gt;wer im Inland **Kennzeichen einer der** in § 86 Abs. 1 Nr. 1, 2 und 4 bezeichneten Parteien oder Vereinigungen verbreitet oder öffentlich, in einer Versammlung oder in von ihm verbreiteten Schriften (§ 11 Abs. 3) verwendet.  

You are chargeable under §86a if you use in public symbols of parties or organizations identified in §86 Abs. 1,2,4. §86 Abs. 1,2,4 is only referenced to identify what is considered unconstitutional, not to qualify what is and isn't chargeable. That's the whole point of §86a. It doesn't matter if you're not a card carrying party member or don't even believe in the ideology and your intent is not to subvert the democratic order. Use of the symbols is illegal and chargeable, regardless of your intent except as under §86 Abs.3. It's not that hard to understand.


&gt;§ 86a StGB regelt das Verwenden von Kennzeichen verfassungswidriger Organisationen, also etwa des Hakenkreuzes als Parteiemblem der NSDAP. Wie bei Paragraph 86 ist die Verbreitung bzw. öffentliche Verwendung entscheidend für die Strafbarkeit der verwendeten Kennzeichen. Ebenfalls finden die in § 86, Absatz 3, formulierten Ausnahmen Verwendung.

The poorest US state (Mississippi) has a GDP per capita of only $32,967, about the same as Spain. If you only count States, the wealthiest State is Delaware with a GDP per capita of $69,667 which is between Australia and Switzerland.

So the difference here isn't as huge as other Countries, but the richest state is a little over twice as wealthy as the poorest per capita.

Secondly, not giving a crap about a name's pronunciation is not the same as having an accent. 

I don't mind people pronouncing ""Bachmann"" wrongly because she's obviously not German. That's just sounds weird to me but I wouldn't complain. I'm talking about people moving from Germany to the USA called ""Neumann"" (that happens very often since the name is pretty common) and then Americans don't bother and pronounce it like ""Newman"" which is as wrong as you can get. It's not even an accent thing anymore. ""very"" and ""wery"" is nothing compared to ""Neumann"" and ""Newman"" not even close. 

And even because Americans don't bother, Germans called Neumann often rename themselves to ""Newman"" if they immigrated to the US. 

I don't even expect perfect German. Just that it sounds a bit German. Germans don't pronounces English names like they'd be pronounced in German either. Neither do the French. 

Maybe it's a cultural difference but In my opinion, it's a matter of respect to try or ask if the name would break your tongue but German names won't do that to an American.

Ça s'appelle du patriotisme économique, mais c'est compliqué à expliquer. Je vais probablement me faire allumer par freddit, mais voici comment ça se passe de manière officieuse : 

En gros, les autoroutes sont la seule partie vraiment rentable des groupes Vinci et Eiffage (par exemple chez Vinci, c'est [50% du résultat net pour 13% du chiffre d'affaires](http://www.vinci.com/vinci.nsf/fr/communiques/pages/20120207-1745.htm)). Chez Eiffage c'est le même ordre de grandeur.

Ces revenus permettent de financer les autres branches, qui elles ne sont pas assez rentables mais indispensables à l'économie française (elles représentent des dizaines de milliers d'emplois non qualifiés). En particulier, cela permet de financer les constructions et l'entretien du réseau routier et ferroviaire (Eurovia par exemple), alors que ces activités n'ont aucun sens économique (le ratio ""resultat opérationnel / chiffre d'affaire"" de Eurovia est de 3,6% ... celui de Vinci construction est de 4,5% ... ces entités ne sont donc pas très rentables).

Pour résumer en simplifiant à l'extrême, on fait payer aux utilisateurs d'autoroutes plus cher pour avoir des constructions et des voies ferrées moins cher.

of course, AFTER you had to attend a MPU because of alcohol, you may not drive under the influence (0.0 % blood alcohol) for 10 years (actually not sure if that was just me, i kinda fucked up hard with 0.00206% blood alcohol). you might also need to stay sober for like a year and prove this via hair or piss, which you have to pay yourself.

This is borrowed at present, at a very favourable interest rate, - that of the UK. The big problem is that an Independent Scotland, as a new economy not even using its own currency, wouldn't enjoy the same low interest rates on its debt, that the UK enjoys. This could have a huge effect on our ability to repay the debt. i'm not saying we couldn't manage it - but other things would have to be cut.
Scotland will get an approximate per capita share of UK national debt. 8% or so. By the time of independence, this is projected to be £1.5 trillion, so we'll get £120 billion to service, at a rate much higher than it would be as part of the UK.
So, with our large debt (by percentage of GDP) to service, the markets will expect us to be making cuts to public services so our debt isn't increasing. Or we'll be punished with higher still interest rates.

Begründen Tatsachen (Verkehrsauffälligkeiten, körperliche oder geistige Mängel) Bedenken gegen die Eignung, kann die Fahrerlaubnisbehörde anordnen, dass ein Gutachten einer Begutachtungsstelle für Fahreignung beigebracht wird (§ 2 Abs. 8 StVG).

Ist jemand ungeeignet zum Führen von Kraftfahrzeugen, ist die Fahrerlaubnis zu entziehen. Mit der Entziehung erlischt die Fahrerlaubnis. Bei einer ausländischen Fahrerlaubnis kann das Recht aberkannt werden, von der Fahrerlaubnis im Inland Gebrauch zu machen (§ 3 Abs. 1 StVG).

Diese Anforderungen sind in der Fahrerlaubnisverordnung (FeV) detailliert in § 11 (Eignung), § 13 (Klärung von Eignungszweifeln bei Alkoholproblematik) und § 14 (Klärung von Eignungszweifeln im Hinblick auf Betäubungsmittel und Arzneimittel) beschrieben.

Because we were in a dominant position, we had to adapt much less than the immigrants have to in our countries. What is your point here exactly? Are you assuming the hilarious implication that immigrants are acting as conquerors? We don't speak their language, we don't wear their clothes, and we don't assume their habits. To say that immigrants to accepting countries aren't conquerors is putting it very mildly. The vast majority of them are working class.     

&gt;They're not forcing Flemish on the US, are they? The Tintin thing is about people from Africa coming to Belgium and asking Belgium to ban one of their prized pieces of literature/art. No comparison here.    
    
I wasn't under the impression the Turkish immigrants of Belgium are forcing me to speak their language either. Again, I don't see your point.     
    
As far as Tintin is concerned. Of course the book should be seen in its context, and shouldn't be banned. (It was just one African man who started the court case, by the way.) The comic is not even racist per sé, but more paternalistic. If we have to start banning books that are racist now, we have to burn all books preceding the 18th century. Even Blaise Pascal was racist in his *Pensées*.   
&gt; Western businessmen actually do often wear classic Arab headscarfs to protect themselves from the sun, and go on camel rides. And women wear veils.. cause they're women. But anyway, even if it weren't the case, again, it's not comparable. They're not forcing Saudi businessmen to wear Hugo Boss suits.

Perhaps slightly over the average, as the regions in the Mediterranean were, because they were prime location for the housing bubble — and easy money brings corruption. But nobody sees the secession as a matter of turning the region into Vegas.

The independence movement is seen very differently depending on who you ask. I'd say most of the people care very little if they stay or go. Of those that are opposed, the most vocal are from the right and talk about a long history of unity of Spain, and how a cohesive nation is crucial for stability. There's also a sizable portion that thinks catalans are being greedy and selfish. That they want to keep the money for themselves. Specially after catalan President Mas himself said that he wouldn't have pushed for this if they had given him a new fiscal agreement. But at the same time, Catalonia has amazing infrastructures that other regions can only dream about (high speed rail, highways, the Olympic Games, etc), so there's a certain sense of ""they have everything and they want MORE?"".

I think it mostly depends on where you come from. People from Madrid and the peninsular centre have it hard to wrap their heads around other regions having a different culture, so they can't understand why would anybody feel alien in Spain. On the other hand, people from external, historical regions, sympathize for the cause or even long for following in the footsteps. They know how it is to have your culture oppressed for so long that it doesn't cut it now to promise to behave. At every turn of the wheel there's a new slap in the face. The Ministry of Culture just tried to pass a new law reducing co-oficial languages to an afterthought, behind foreign languages in curricular relevance.
