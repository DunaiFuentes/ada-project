Besides, the metal plate would have to be pretty god damn thick to stop that 7.62 round, and even then any hard metal loses integrity once it's been shot at repeatedly so a full 30-round 7.62 magazine would thoroughly rape anything less than probably an inch.

For example, normal bullet proof vests include a metal chestpiece about 1 inch thick right at the center chest next to the heart because that added protection there is just worth the weight.

Alles was nicht Rechts oder Links ist kann man auch nicht mit den klassischen Mitteln die sich seit Jahrzehnten bewährt haben bekämpfen. Es ist auch auf der einen Seite schwer dem Publikum die Gefahr vernünftig zu verkaufen, da dieses das auch nicht wirklich erfassen kann. Man kann das aber wie wir grad sehen zu einer ultimativen Gefahr ausbauen. Das ist viel besser als die alten Schläferagenten oder so etwas. Da sich in der letzten Dekade jeder Islamist der was auf sich hält irgendwie mit AlQuaida identifiziert hat, hat das den Mythos nur noch gestärkt.

Das gleiche kann man jetzt im Rahmen des ""Anarchismus"" durchziehen. Man kann damit alles abfangen. Die Teilnehmer an der Occupy Bewegung oder Anonymous machen dabei praktisch nichts anderes als die o.g. Terroristen die sich zu AlQuaida bekennen womit sie dann diesen Mythos füttern.

Ich wünsche diesem mehr Erfolg als AlQuaida ;)

Weder das eine noch das andere is besonders realistisch: der Kopfschuss ist extrem schwer, der Beinschuss garantiert nicht die Wirkung die man erreichen will und ist auch kein garantierter Treffer.

Wenn es zum Einsatz der Waffe kommt, dann ""center mass"" wie man im Englischen sagt: die zentrale Masse wird anvisiert a.k.a. Torso.
Egal wie nah man dran ist, ein bewegendes Ziel, z.B. eine mit Messer im Büro herumfuchtelnde Frau, kann immer verfehlt werden.
Die sicherste Möglichkeit zu treffen und eine mannstoppende Wirkung zu erzielen, ist der Schuss in den Torso. Keine Alternative.

Und wer bereits nen Polizisten mit nem Messer verletzt hat, dieser und andere Personen sich noch in beengten Raum mit dem Angreifer befinden und der Angreifer auf mehrfache Aufforderung nicht die Waffe fallen lässt (dieser Fakt wurde in keinem der Artikel die ich gelesen habe bestritten) - der hat imho nichts anderes verdient als den Einsatz der Schusswaffe.

Ganz klare Abwendung von Gefahr für Leib und Leben der anwesenden Personen.
Die einzige Unverhältnismäßigkeit ist möglicherweise der nicht stattgefundene Warnschuss, aber naja. Ob der Erfolg gehabt hätte ist zu bezweifeln (andere Warnungen wurden ja auch ignoriert) und der Warnschuss kann in so nem beengten Raum auch für andere gefährlich werden, man weiß nie wie so ne Kugel abprallt.

Fakt ist: Egal wie verzweifelt die Situation ist, wer mit nem Messer nicht nur droht, sondern tatsächlich angreift und verletzt, noch dazu nen Polizisten und das ganze im Beisein von anderen - selber Schuld.

It's a completely voluntary policy that reddit made up. There's nothing that legally says that policy has to be in place (well, at least not in the US where reddit is based), so it's just something that reddit has decided it will do.

The principle here is that a private company is entitled to provide the service they see fit (within legal limits).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_dish (Of course. Can be easily bought used.)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-noise_block_downconverter

And cables. Bigger satellite dish=better reception. Depends on where you live. But you can buy these things pretty cheap used. Just look on ebay or something.

After assembly (again, it's not hard if you have the cables already in place/easy to set up, just look it up) you have to adjust the satellite dish. You will want to use one of the astra satellites. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astra_%28satellite%29

I'd assume you know some german. You can look up the sattelites here https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES_Astra#Orbitalpositionen

The last thing you have to do is ""point"" your dish at the satellite.
Here is a calculator.
http://www.satsig.net/maps/satellite-tv-dish-pointing-uk-ireland.htm

You will need some time to find the right position, assistance is vital if you install the dish further away from the TV, as one person has to adjust the dish, and the other one has to tell if a signal is getting picked up. Last time I had to do this, I needed about half an hour with one person standing on the roof and the other one telling if it worked or not.


It may sound difficult, but really. If you have the wiring, or plan to put the dish on your balcony, it's not hard at all. If you can hook up a TV, you can hook up the LNB and receiver, too.

Also the people on the ground say the police started hitting a guy behind a police line, and that's why they threw the rocks and chairs.

true,funkshanker,null,null,"We're arguing about the definition of censorship. You seem to be arguing that only government-sanctioned censorship qualifies as censorship. You might be confused as to the definition of ""[censorship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship)"", because your argument is false. Again, it doesn't matter who is doing the censorship. Here's the first bit from wikipedia:

&gt;Censorship is the suppression of speech or other public communication which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or inconvenient to the general body of people as determined by a government, media outlet, **or other controlling body.**

It could be a church, it could be your parents, it could be your teachers, or your cable provider. It's still **censorship**.

Now that we're on the same page regarding what censorship is, we can agree that reddit (not a government) **censors** some objectionable and illegal material, such as child porn, personal information, extremely hateful speech, etc. These categories are censored because they are potentially harmful to people, as they tend to promote exploitation and violence. 

&gt;Is it censorship when reddit bans a user who reveals another user's real name?

Yes, it is. And, like CP and extreme hate speech, it's one of very few justifiable reasons to censor something. A private company who provides internet access but decides to **censor** a tech blog simply because they don't agree with the content is unjustified censorship. Granted, they probably have a lengthy Terms of Use agreement that says they can censor whatever they like, but the bottom line is that they're providing access to the internet, not ""access to the parts of the internet that they happen to agree with.""

And yes, I agree that the best way to fight this type of behavior is by boycotting businesses who decide to censor information and communication.

- My opinion on separatist movements:

It is a no hands approach. You do not touch them with a stick. If they are well rounded they will eventually come to power either through politics, either through arms. If they are weak they will be subjugated either by politics, either by arms.

- My opinion on separatist movements in Europe (with the given and necessary generalizations):

They are product of a generational backlash of oppression. Their grandparents were oppressed during the last century during WWI WWII and European Dictatorships, they transmitted their well founded hate to their sons and grandsons, but the cause of such hate was not felt by any of those. Nevertheless they are vocal because it was culturally imbued to them. - **This means that they are not currently justified.**

&gt; while accepting that white phosphorous is not at this stage proscribed under international law, finds that the Israeli armed forces were systematically reckless in determining its use in built-up areas.

* Mark Cantora: Israel And White Phosphorus During Operation Cast Lead: [A Case Study](http://web.archive.org/web/20110726123405/http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/194/26/) In Adherence To Inadequate Humanitarian Laws:

&gt; V.  CONCLUSION

&gt; Israel's use of white phosphorus in its Gaza offensive from December 2008 to January 2009 was not illegal under international humanitarian law.  Israel's use of white phosphorus was legal under the Geneva Gas Protocol, the CWC, Protocol III of the CCW, and the fundamental international humanitarian rules as found in the GCIV and customary international humanitarian law norms.  Although not a signatory to many of the above treaties, Israel followed the rules listed therein.  All of the evidence of civilian casualties and injuries caused by Israel's white phosphorus use is consistent with casualties resulting from errant, mistaken, and incidental harm caused by white phosphorus used legally as an obscurant. 

&gt; However, while the world has been focused on Israel's failure to further limit civilian casualties during the Gaza Conflict, the failure of the international legal community to address the dangers of white phosphorus has been largely ignored.  Although Israel cannot be faulted for not following laws that *should exist, but do not*, the international legal community can be faulted for not having already recognized this serious gap in international humanitarian law and taken immediate remedial measures.

Ireland's independence movement had nothing to do with either of those wars, and I don't think you could really make any link with Scotland either.

The issues driving Scottish independence are much more a difference in political opinion rather than some kind of oppression. E.g.:

* Possession of nuclear weapons. Obviously beneficial to the UK in terms of maintaining their global power, less beneficial to Scotland given that they're all located here but it's difficult to see under what circumstances we would ever fire them).
* Different opinions over ""social spending"" (healthcare, education, etc). The UK government devolves some of these issues to Scotland already, which means these opinions are already being put into practice through different policies (e.g., prescription drugs are paid-for in England, but free in Scotland).
* Different opinions over energy. The UK as a whole is not putting the investment into renewable energy that many other countries are, and many Scottish politicians see this as a wasted opportunity (given the tradition of engineering in Scotland, and the coastal/wind resources available).
* Different opinions over foreign policy. The UK government has taken great pride in maintaining an extremely close relationship with the US, and following their lead over issues like Iraq &amp; Afghanistan. I think it's safe to say the UK probably would be involved in future conflicts like Iran, whereas Scotland almost certainly wouldn't (any more than Iceland would).

There is definitely some historical baggage kicking around, however the most interesting part of the current Scottish independence movement is how small a part that plays within Scotland itself. The real context within Scotland is the devolved Scottish parliament.

This was set up in 1998, and is widely seen (in Scotland) as being a success.

&gt; It's unlikely Scotland would aim to change many of the UK's current EU policies in the short term (as, by and large, they work well for Scotland too). 

Of course, Scotland the sovereign state wouldn't be complete different from Scotland the country part of UK. Most things probably wouldn't change but rather evolve slowely in a variation of the UK.

There's also the question whether or not to include oil prices, because they have an enormous effect. You gotta do it somehow, though. I'm not aware of a better method.

However, those purchases weren't made in 1990, the conversion is just as artificial as the one back to today, only in reverse. The bigger problem, especially for trade between Eurozone countries, is probably the conversion rate from euros to dollars and back -- the purchasing power per euro changes very slowly from year to year, but the exchange rate to dollars does not.

In practice I think keeping the pound would work fine - it means you are using another country's central bank, but that's a loss of control you would also have using the euro. Given that there would continue to be a lot of cross-border trade it seems extremely unlikely the UK government would pursue a financial policy that was detrimental to Scotland (or even could, in a way that wasn't also detrimental to the UK as a whole).

The bigger issues are probably things like the national debt or the proto-nationalisation of the banking system. Scotland needs to take away a %ge of those negative things too, and there isn't really an obvious answer (is splitting debts based on %ge of UK population more/less fair than splitting based on %ge contribution to UK tax revenues, etc).

true,mojojo42,SCOT,Scotland,"It's an interesting question, because at the time politicians were saying a devolved parliament ""will kill nationalism stone dead"".

Partly because it was meant to act as an outlet for nationalist feeling, and partly because the voting system was designed to prevent a single party from achieving a majority (the idea was that only one party is pro-independence, so if coalitions are required then it will never happen).

Unfortunately this backfired, and in 2011 the pro-independence party (SNP) did manage to obtain a majority (they ran a reasonable coalition government in 2007, so I think people started to feel they were no worse than any other politicians: they are quite left-wing, which in general Scotland is too).

You could argue that their majority came at the expense of the other parties - in fact the 2011 results were so bad that all three of the other leaders resigned. Their replacements are all quite inexperienced and not widely known, whereas the SNP leader has been around forever, so in terms of timing it couldn't be worse for an anti-independence argument.

In fact the more experienced anti-independence politicians are all leading the UK-wide parties, and historically only one of those has been effective at winning votes in Scotland (with the main right-wing one having a particularly bad reputation due to things like imposing new taxes on Scotland a year before the rest of the UK).

But if the parliament hadn't existed I doubt the SNP would have been able to generate enough popular support to demand a referendum (there was a previous one in 1979, but it's not something that people were seriously talking about even 5 years ago).

So I think it's a really interesting combination of events - without the devolved parliament, the SNP wouldn't have anywhere near the influence they currently have. But then it took 10 years before the SNP won control of that parliament, and everyone anti-independence seems to be making mis-step after mis-step, so you wonder how much of it is due to everyone else failing rather than the SNP succeeding.

Having said that, there are several extremely unpopular policies being pushed through at the UK level just now (increased university fees, ""American-style"" privatisation of the health service), all of which the SNP are able to prevent happening in Scotland. In fact there have also been some quite progressive laws which the Scottish parliament implemented before the rest of the UK (smoking ban was 1 year ahead, minimum pricing for alcohol looks to follow, etc), which I think people are quite proud of.

There is definitely a sense that the arguments anti-independence are all [quite negative](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/political-news/english-would-bomb-our-airports.17005697), whereas the pro-independence arguments are more positive (who wouldn't want to control their own destiny, fix our long-standing health and infrastructure issues, take our place in Europe, etc...).

The referendum question is going to be ""Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?"". Most people in the UK (not just Scotland) believe that Scotland is a *different* country to England/Wales/NI, so I think the answer will probably be yes (and that the step to independence is simply a small step sideways, vs some kind of crazy civil war).",0,1332550756,null,0,false,0,c44b4al,t3_rabka,t1_c44b4al,t1_c44ajql,null,1428582782,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Zitat: ""da sticht die 39-Jährige mit einem Steakmesser nach ihm, verletzt ihn am Unterarm und durch die Schutzweste am Bauch""

1. ne Weste bedeckt eben nur den Torso. Wichtige Blutgefäße gibts überall.
2. Im Büro befanden sich laut Artikel noch ein Sachbearbeiter, ein Vorgesetzter und ein Sicherheitsmann. mindestens 2 davon OHNE Weste.
3. entscheidend: DURCH die Weste.
Kriegt man halt auch gesagt, wenn man ne Splitterschutz-, ballistische, stichsichere oder was auch immer Weste bekommt: kein 100%iger Schutz.

Punkt 1. führt auch direkt auf das ""Beinschuss"" Argument zurück:
Im Bein verläuft u.a. die femorale Aterie, die bei nem Beintreffer sehr oft auch getroffen wird. Da blutet man so schnell aus, ist auch nicht weniger tödlich als nen Torsotreffer. Bei Mehr Körperfett am Torso ist da die Chance auf überleben möglicherweise sogar größer...

Und ich vermute mal stark, dass du noch nie mit Pistolen auf Mannscheiben geschossen hast. In so ner Situation ist es verdammt schwer, nen Beintreffer zu landen, noch dazu mit Möbeln o.ä.
Und das Ziel ist eben, die Gefahr _garantiert_ zu stoppen. Nur der Körpertreffer ist annähernd garantiert, und nur der Körpertreffer garantiert die _stoppende_ Wirkung. 
Grade bei starkem Adrenalineinfluss, psychischen Störungen oder Drogeneinfluss ist ein Beinschuss mit ner 9mm nicht mal annähernd mannstoppend, da gibts genug Erfahrungsberichte zu. 
Da man als Polizist o.ä. nie einschätzen kann unter welchen Einflüssen der Angreifer steht muss man zwangsläufig die sichere Variante nehmen um die Gefahr für andere schnell und sicher zu beenden.

Firstly, Europe gets more powerful as it acts with unity of purpose, but unfortunately that is not something which can be legislated for overnight, it is limited by the rate of integration and intermixture of European life, both political and cultural, which will necessarily be tentative because of existing linguistic and cultural barriers. 

Secondly, the power of Europe tracks its economic productive capacity, which will almost certainly increase, but almost inevitably be in relative decline as a percentage of the global economy, because mature economies have to be constantly innovative, rather than simply deploying existing, predeveloped technologies. So it's a balance between the rate of integration on the one hand, and the rate of relative economic decline on the other.

The rate of economic decline could be fast, or could be very slow, depending on the intelligence of our policies. I think a lot of the economic problems we've seen recently are basically political, to do with structural flaws in the creation of the single currency, shown up by the idiocy and hubris of the liberalized banking system, and we'll have to do running repairs. 

The issues are two-fold: that European balance books need to be sufficiently robust to be able to borrow in the short term to stimulate our economies, and then that European countries have to be sufficiently competitive with the rest of the world, for that stimulant to have a continuing effect, of creating solid growth. Competitiveness requires the European public support things like labour market reforms, which Germany is trying to encourage Greece, Spain and Italy to pursue. Robustness requires the the stability of the whole continent's banking system doesn't rely on the short term health of the periphery. In pursuit of this goal the ECB has been buying up all the debt held by banks in core economies, and in pursuit of patching up those long term structural defects, Eurozone plus countries have signed up to the fiscal compact.

Das sind Monate, die ein da Gebliebener gleich welchen Geschlechts eben mehr über Unternehmensabläufe lernt, sich besser integriert, für das Unternehmen wertvoller wird.

- You may want to check out the Gothic quarter.  It does have a good amount of tourist foot traffic, but less so in the evening.  There is also a good selection of locations to eat and have a drink.  

- Be aware that there is no alcohol sold at Camp Nou.  If you need a drink have a few at one of the many bars that are near the stadium, however most, if not all, will be really packed before game time.  You could also just purchase your drink of choice at a supermarket and indulge outside the stadium.  At least that is something I noticed a good amount of people doing when I was there.

- Get to Camp Nou with ample time.  It doesn't really matter what type of transportation you take(taxi, metro, legs, etc.) there will be a good amount of traffic. It is a site to see as you get closer to the stadium, everyone wearing their Barca jerseys, in anticipation... at least for me as a Barca fan it was almost overwhelming, in a good way :).  Personally, I would recommend taking the metro and getting off at Badal, Collblanc, or Les Corts and walking the 5 or so blocks to the stadium.

- It is true there are a lot of pickpockets in Barcelona, but with the size of group you will have I don't really see there being an issue.  Just don't let anyone wander off alone and if they do, be aware a pickpocket will attempt to be friendly.  I've seen two examples: the ""Ronaldinho"" where the person will get close and pretend to show you a soccer move, and another where they ask if you know a martial art and attempt to show you some ""moves.""

- Hostels usually have advertisements for free walking tours, with instructions on where to meet and what time.  I would recommend going to one.  They're usually about one or two hours long and the tour guides are mostly British expats who've been in Barcelona for some time.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"There used to be an ongoing [disagreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_214_submarine#Greek_Navy_orders) between Greece and a German manufacturer of submarines. The first of those was build in Germany and is reported to have had technical problems, three others were built in a Greek shipyard that the manufacturer had bought for this purposes. Another issue apparently were outstanding payments.  
Very early on in the crisis, Daniel Cohn-Bendit delivered a speech in the European parliament in which he claimed Greek officials had told him that they had been pressured to buy German submarines and French helicopters. I assume that this refers to the first of those submarines, the plan now seems to be that Greece will take delivery and then sells it off to another country. The SIPRI database lists this submarine as delivered in 2010, along with orders for two French AS-532 Cougar/AS-332 helicopters (delivery in 2011).  
It also lists orders for building two more submarines under license, also for 2010, instead of a previous order to modernize two older German made submarines of the Greek military. Greece may have preferred this because this way the jobs will be at home.

The SIPRI database doesn't list any other order from either Germany, France or the Netherlands for 2010 or 2011.

So, my best guess is that Germany hinted that, since the technical problems for that submarine have now been resolved and it had been made to order, they expect Greece to pay for it. If France had tried to abuse this situation and only got orders for two Eurocopters out of it, then they weren't very efficient in their bullying.

We all have things happening in our countries that hurt, sadden, or embarrassed, or that we feel are  unjust.  So at yours before you start accusing  others.  

We should be focusing on helping those disadvantaged, or going through hardships.   No  country is immune to suffering and pain - and when you least expect it tragedy can strike  eg  a Tsunami.

I've never been robbed or assaulted in the most touristic places in Barcelona but standard security rules should apply at night: no big cameras/bags and only a small wallet with minimum amount of money/cards in front pocket.

&gt; 2) Where should we look to go in the evenings? We're all around 30, and there are 2 fathers there (both in their 50s) - we're not going to go wild. We just want somewhere nice to visit, drink, laugh and talk?

Taking into a account a part of the group is near Sagrada Familia, this should be a mandatory visit. I also recommend Montjuïch: take the tube to Plaça Espanya and start going up: you'll find museums, parks and the Olympic Stadium.  

For drinking some beers I recommend to go to the beach and have a nice time on a sunny day seated in front of the sea with cold beer. Citatella/Villa Olimpica tube station is the best one to find to the beach. Walk away from the big two towers (Mapfre and Hotel Arts) towards the NE and have a drink in any 'chiringuito'.

For dinner your group is huge for Barcelona standards so I recommend to make reservations as soon as possible.

&gt; 3) We're going to take in Barca v Bilbao on the Sunday evening at Camp Nou - any advice before we go to the game? Travel wise? Anything at all that we wouldn't know?
 
Arrive early and be patient when leaving: it takes time to get in and out of the Stadium. You may also visit the Barça Museum, but if you plan to do it arrive 2 hours early.

true,mojojo42,SCOT,Scotland,"In both cases the equation is ""raw material + processing energy = useful work"".

For hydrocarbons the raw material are things like coal, oil, and gas. They still need energy to process them, but they produce quite a lot of energy once refined.

For hydrogen the raw material is (lets say) seawater and the processing is (lets say) electrolysis. That may well be less efficient than hydrocarbons, in the sense that it requires more energy to go from the raw materials to the same amount of useful work.

At present hydrocarbons are relatively easy to locate, not too hazardous to refine, and so are an extremely useful source of energy. However the amount of hydrogen within hydrocarbons is dwarfed by the amount of hydrogen within seawater - there's a lot more seawater than there is oil.

Similarly, the amount of energy falling on the ocean's surface from the sun is gigantic. Even if you assume the processing is woefully inefficient, it's easily sufficient to separate the H and O. Lets assume for the moment that you wouldn't just build a solar power plant on land: my point is there's a huge amount of reasonably-accessible hydrogen, and a huge amount of energy with which to access it.

What you do with that hydrogen is a separate question: you might simply burn it there and then to generate electricity, you might pipe it to an existing turbine and burn it there, you might liquify it for transport, etc (what you choose probably depends on what existing infrastructure you want to connect to).

I suspect our long-term (1000+ year) energy needs will be met by fusion, however in the short term (200+ year) hydrogen seems as plausible a source as any to take over from oil (assuming we don't continue to separate mass energy production from consumption and use electricity for both transport and storage).",0,1332601230,null,0,false,0,c44g3zj,t3_r9sj6,t1_c44g3zj,t1_c44fxah,null,1428585273,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,Naurgul,null,null,"Some remarks on the video, which although do not impact its validity overall, need to be made: 

* The claim that the real 2009 deficit was significantly smaller than the one presented is disputed. What we know is this: First, there is this guy that used to work in the Statistics Agency that has come forward and has claimed that the 2009 deficit was much smaller than was presented. He has offered no evidence though. We also know that newly elected governments in Greece tend to do the following trick: they make the deficit of the year they are elected bigger by making payments earlier than necessary. Then, it appears as though the deficit next year was decreased. It is almost certain that the last government did this in late 2009. Finally, we know that the way the deficit is calculated was changed in 2010 to include the debts of institutions whose debts the government provides guarantees for. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that is not the case for most other countries in Europe, right? So, my point is that even though the deficit was probably smaller, the debt spiral was very unsustainable regardless.  The conspiracy that the deficit was changed so Greece could apply for loans from the IMF/ECB/EU seems ridiculous to me. I'm pretty sure there is no evidence for it whatsoever. 

* Some absolute numbers for wages, taxes etc are provided to make a point. [Here's some context on comparative price levels](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Comparative_price_levels_for_food,_beverages_and_tobacco) without which it's difficult to tell if his argument makes sense or not.

* Income tax in Greece is not regressive, it's progressive. However, it's less progressive than countries like the Netherlands, Germany etc. The tax was made slightly more progressive in 2010, but the difference was minuscule. As an example, I think the top bracket is 45% and it applies to everyone that has an income above 100k euros. The argument about the effective corporate tax rate being below 8% is new to me. I'd be glad if anyone could provide a confirmation or refutation. All I know is that the corporate tax rate was 24% and was decreased to 20% since the beginning of the crisis. By the way, here's a [nice objective summary on the taxation situation in the EU](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-DU-10-001/EN/KS-DU-10-001-EN.PDF), Greece starts on page 194.

Am Ende läuft es darauf hinaus. Arbeitslosigkeit ist eben vielfach nicht ein Ausdruck von Arbeitsplatzmangel, sondern von einem Unwillen fachfremde oder ""zu niedere"" Arbeit anzunehmen oder sich zu qualifizieren. Arbeitgeber sind keine Arbeitsplatz-Versorgungseinrichtungen, es sind Unternehmer, und Unternehmer stellen Leute ein, wenn Sie damit den Unternehmensgewinn steigern können. Wenn ein Arbeitsloser dazu nicht in der Lage scheint, wieso sollte er eingestellt werden?

Unabhängig davon bin ich für eine radikale Vereinfachung und Unterstützung von Arbeitslosen, die sich selbstständig machen wollen - im behördlichen und steuertechnischen Sinn.

The other thing is that those ""right wing"" parties are lately becoming almost indistinguishable from ""left wing"", especially in economic matters.

All Romanian and Bulgarian gipsies that I see in Helsinki have a very dark skin complexion, they look more like Indians or Pakistanis, some look like north-Africans. In Romania and Bulgaria you identify gipsies from their looks, you straight away identify everyone with a darker skin or complexion on being a gipsy.

However in Finland many Roma either have light dark complexion or not at all due to mixed heritage. In addition to that Finnish society has become more multiracial and tolerant due to adoption from foreign countries, mixed marriages, refugees and work related immigration. If you have darker skin in here it really doesn't tell anything, you can be an average Finn or an engineer from India working for the NSN/Nokia. The color of skin doesn't matter.

If you are Roma from Romania or Bulgaria and you dress like everybody else and act like everybody else then you are treated like everybody else as nobody knows your background. And in case you tell somebody of your background, they don't associate it to gipsies begging in the streets, because you clearly aren't one of them.

So what is the problem? Let me tell you what is the problem, the problem is that both Romania and Bulgaria have caused a gipsy problem on to our streets. We didn't have beggars, we didn't have illegal camps before these countries became EU members and enabled their minority groups to spread all over Europe. That is fact. And as the summer comes there will be more beggars and other people causing general nuisance around the streets. There is a real problem of gipsies around here and that is fault of both Romania and Bulgaria and they have to start doing something to it. 

Saying that it is racial stereotyping to identify people begging and causing nuisances on our cities to be hurtful is only going to cause anger. It is a fact, you can't deny it. It is a fact that both Romania and Bulgaria have problems on their societies that is showing in the streets of our society.

**Alex is forced to go into psychiatry**

The transsexual Alex sees herself as girl and lives that way. Now a court ruled that the transsexuality was induced by her mother. The kid is now forced to go into psychatry  

It's now possible to institutionalise the transsexual Alex Kaminski (name changed (by taz I typed what they wrote)). This was ruled by a court in Berlin on thursday. The mother of Alex has sued against the ruling of the youth welfare service and lost. Her lawyer is announcing that he will appeal against this ruling to the next higher court (Verfassungsgericht).  

It's now possible to institutionalise a child, who felt as a girl her whole life and lifes that way, into the Berlin Charite hospital. The youth service was able to make this decission because the divorced parents of Alex coudn't agree on health issues of the child and gave this responsibility to them. The responsible employee of the welfare service is proposing a clincal treatment and foster parents afterwards.  

The carer is argueing that the mother of the child has ""induced"" the transsexuality and Alex has to be freed from the influence of her mother. According to the head physician Klaus Beier of the Charite the treament will try to introduce him (genderchange on purpose in the original article) to his ""biological"" gender and will try to prevent ""gender untypical behavior"" The Hamburg sexuality scientiest Hertha Richter calls this statment a ""outdated mindset"". A institutionalisation is according to her a stupid move. It's possible to find out if the transsexuality was induced with non stationary methods.  

**No evaluation needed**  
Mother and daughter now ask for a psychiatric evaluation. The court is refusing this evaluation. A evaluation is not neccasery, the lawyer of the family quotis from the verdict. The reasioning of the carer seems logical, the institutionalisation is within the judgment of the youth services. Also the mother is to be blamed for intending to bring her daugther to a specialist of transsexuality in the childhoold in Hamburg and Frankfurt am Main.

The attorney is calling this verdict ""frightening"": ""The belief that transsexuality could be induced without resitance is not based on scientific results. This is an invention by this carer"". She just talked to the kid whos whishes are ignored. once for an hour.

Attorney and the family want to go to the Bundesverfassungsgericht now. This court has the possiblity to make quick decessions in custody matters.  

**International signature campaing**  
Alex is getting support by human rights activists. On Monday, 15 o'clock the ""Aktionsbündnis Alex"" will demonstrate infront of the Berlin goverment buildings. The claim will be ""The institutionalisation  of Alex has to stop now!"". ""This is not a single case"", the flyer reads, ""institues like the youth services and the Charity are putting pressure and force on people. Every gender and every sexual identity is a right, not a sickness.""

A signature cmapain has already started. THe british transsexuales activist Katrina Swalses started it on change.org. Calling on Berlins mayor Klaus Wowereit it reads: ""This young girl will be teached that her feelings are wrong and she will be forced into self denial, which costed many transsexuals their life"". The petition was signed by over 9000 people.

And Alex? She wanted the help of a psychologist to deal with this crisis. The youth services denied this whish.

No, that's incomplete. Of course, I'm *not* a lawyer ;)

However, I am a male Boy Scout leader and a male teacher in the making. Both of which, apparently, are required to know the law to the letter.

Your corresponding term in the US may be a *shelter care hearing order*. In Germany, the term is *Inobhutnahme* which is also a *court order* meaning the youth services do the actual work but don't decide on whether to act or not. That decision is the responsibility of the court.

In France, it's quite the opposite. Friends are harder to find but easier to keep. Finding yourself a hobby would be a good idea to make friends. Hanging out in pubs should be a good idea too. I found that people in pubs are more open and friendly to strangers that say ""trendy and fashion"" bars.

true,Roham21,null,null,"Man sieht eine Metzgerei. Hinter dem Tresen steht die Metzgerin, eine vielleicht vierzig Jahre alte blonde und meeeegafreundlich aussehende Frau; vor dem Tresen stehen zwei ältere Damen unbestimmbaren Alters; auf jeden Fall sind sie älter als die Metzgerin. Plötzlich betritt ein wahres Bild von einem Mann die Metzgerei und zieht sofort die Blicke der drei Frauen auf sich – er ist vielleicht 35, sehr groß und stattlich gebaut, trägt sehr einfache und altmodische, eher bäuerlich anmutende Kleidung und dunkelblonde, leicht gewellte, lange Haare – mit anderen Worten: er sieht aus wie eine Kreuzung aus Connor McLeod (Highlander) und Thomas Gottschalk, was ihn mehr oder weniger zum feuchten Traum jeder etwas älteren Schwiegermutter macht (das war jetzt echt gemein, aber ich kann nicht anders... *schäm*).

Als er die Theke erreicht hat – immer noch fassungslos beobachtet von den drei Damen, spricht er ein einfaches aber anscheinend dennoch magisches Wort: „Rügenwalder“ (von Manieren hat der Mensch anscheinend noch nichts gehört – wo ich herkomme, würde man sagen: „Rügenwalder BITTE!“ Mann, Mann, Mann...); seine Stimme ist dabei ziemlich leise und soll wohl verführerisch und sexy klingen, was mir aber irgendwie immer entgeht - vielleicht bin ich aber einfach kein Teil der Zielgruppe, für die diese Werbung gedacht ist. Auf die Metzgerin scheint die Stimme (in Kombination mit dem Aussehen) aber dennoch zu wirken, denn sie fragt mit einer gehauchten, fast nicht zu hörenden Stimme (in etwa so, als hätte ihr jemand eine wilde Liebesnacht mit den Zillertaler Schürzenjägern angeboten): „Teewurst?“ Wie jetzt – die ist Metzgerin, zum damaligen Zeitpunkt gab es von Rügenwalder NUR Teewurst, und die muss trotzdem nachfragen? Spricht nicht unbedingt für ihre Ausbildung, aber egal, vielleicht hat sie den netten Herren vor lauter Hormonüberschuß ja auch nur nicht ganz verstanden... Das scheint auch Connor / Thomas klar zu werden, denn er wiederholt ein wenig eindringlicher das magische Wort: „Rügenwalder.“ Dennoch scheint sein Anliegen noch immer nicht zu der mit offenem Mund und ziemlich dämlich aussehenden Dauerlächeln dastehenden Metzgerin durchgedrungen zu sein, denn sie zeigt auf einen ganzen Stapel Rügenwalder Wurst, der sich hinter ihr befindet und fragt mit noch etwas atemloserer, fast schon versagender Stimme: „Diese hier?“ Das wäre DIE Chance für Connor / Thomas, das Trauerspiel schnell zu beenden („JA VERDAMMT, DIESE HIER!!! Meine Fresse...“), aber nein – er erwidert mit grenzenloser Geduld (die fast schon an ein erbauliches Gespräch mit den Zeugen Jehovas erinnert): „Die mit der Mühle!“ Jetzt erwachen auch die beiden vor der Theke stehenden älteren Damen aus ihrer Erstarrung und lockern die schon zu diesem Zeitpunkt schreiend blöde Werbung durch einen kryptischen und den wahrscheinlich sinnlosesten Dialog in der gesamten Geschichte des deutschen Werbefernsehens auf: Dame 1: „Aha – mit der Mühle!“ Dame 2: „Natürlich.“

Kann mir bitte jemand sagen, was das soll? Wird in diesem Dorf schon den Kindern beigebracht, dass auf einer echten Rügenwalder eine Mühle abgebildet ist? Sind in den letzten Jahren immer wieder Leute durch gepanschte Rügenwalder-Imitate (natürlich ohne Mühle) gestorben oder leiden seitdem an nicht enden wollendem Durchfall, so dass nun JEDER vor dem Kauf einer Wurst erst einmal nach der Mühle auf der Packung sucht? Ich weiß es einfach nicht... Egal. Auf jeden Fall scheint die Metzgerin nun endlich verstanden zu haben, was der nette Herr von ihr möchte, und sie geht in dem Verkaufsgespräch einen Schritt weiter – sie fragt: „Wie viele?“. Und jedem, der die Werbung zu diesem Zeitpunkt halbwegs verstanden hat, ist klar, welche Antwort zwangsläufig kommen muss: „Alle.“ Diese Angabe scheint nun für die Metzgerin kein größeres Problem darzustellen, denn sie lädt Connor / Thomas – mit einem mittlerweile leicht eingefrorenen, beinahe grenzdebilen Lächeln - sämtliche hinter ihr liegenden Rügenwalder auf, worauf er sich umdreht und unter leicht unterdrücktem Grunzen (was soll das bedeuten? Spricht da der heimliche Jäger und Sammler in ihm, der sich über die Beute freut? „Hähäää – Essen! Grunz...“) den Laden verläßt. Auch hier zeigt sich wieder, dass der Typ nicht einmal den Ansatz von Manieren hat – auch wenn ich die Metzgerin verarscht habe, mußte ich trotzdem zahlen... Wer zu diesem Zeitpunkt die Fernbedienung noch nicht gefunden und schleunigst umgeschaltet hat, der darf im zweiten Teil dieser Werbung miterleben, was übermäßiger Drogenkonsum bei Werbefachleuten alles anrichten kann...

In einer kurzen Sequenz sieht man Connor / Thomas über eine Wiese reiten, dann erfolgt ein Schnitt auf einen vielleicht 16jährigen Jungen, der vor einer ca. 10 Meter hohen, roten zweidimensionalen Nachbildung einer Mühle steht (schließlich gehört so etwas auf jede Wiese, die etwas auf sich hält) und, als er Connor / Thomas entdeckt, freudig mit den Armen wedelnd ruft:“ Er kommt!“ Es erfolgt ein weiterer Schnitt, und nun erfährt der Zuschauer endlich, was aus dem verloren gegangenen Zweig der Kelly-Family geworden ist: Die Bande hat irgendwo auf einem Acker mysteriöse Sekte gegründet, die auf der Anbetung einer götzenhaften roten Mühle und dem Konsum qualitativ minderwertiger Teewurst basiert! Was man nicht so alles in der Werbung erfährt... Jedenfalls sieht man eine größere Anzahl grob gezimmerte Holztische und Bänke, um die eine Menge ebenfalls pseudo-highlandermäßig gekleidete Männer sitzen (sind da auch Frauen dabei? Weiß ich gerade nicht), die freudig die gelieferte Wurst in Empfang nehmen und ziemlich auf „Ritterfressen“ machen, indem sie die Wurst ungefähr fünf Zentimeter dick auf mindestens ebenso dicke Brotscheiben verteilen; getrunken wird dabei standesgemäß etwas bierartiges aus irgendwelchen derben Steingut-Krügen. Diese malerische Szene wird untermalt von einem gestandenen Männerchor, der schmettert: „Rügenwalder Mühlenfest – lebe hoch! Würzig grob, herzhaft fein – wir hau’n rein!“ Dann endet die Werbung und der fassungslose Zuschauer wird ohne Aussicht auf Erlösung den bohrenden Fragen überlassen, die nun auf ihn einstürmen: Meinen die das ECHT ernst? Was zum Geier haben die geraucht? Wird die Metzgerin beim Sex mit ihrem Mann nur noch an Connor / Thomas denken? Sehe ich auch irgendwann so aus, wenn ich zu viel Teewurst esse? Wieso habe ich diese große rote Aufstell-Mühle eigentlich noch nie bei Ikea gesehen? Meinen die das ECHT ernst? Meinen die das ECHT...

Secondly, it costs our money to keep our streets clean from Romanian and Bulgarian beggars and criminals. And it isn't that easy. What do we do with a Romanian/Bulgarian caught begging, give a ticket when we know that A) the person doesn't have money to pay it, and B) there is no way to force the person to pay it in the future, of course we could legislate begging to be worth jail time, but that costs even more money, keeping people in jail isn't free. The same goes with illegal camps, when you tell them to go, they only go to another places, again giving tickets or throwing them into jail doesn't help.

Genau, das darf man nicht. Von allen Eigeninitiative zu fordern in einer Situation, die schon allein rechnerisch nicht aufgeht ist perfide und arrogant. Wir leben in einem Staat und das was du ""Versorgungsanspruchshaltung"" nennst, nenne ich im Umkehrschluß Menschlichkeit. Doch, Couch gammeln kann eine Lösung sein. Wir haben die Maschinen erfunden, die immer mehr Jobs wegrationalisieren und jetzt müssen wir einen anderen gesellschaftlichen Weg gehen als kontextfreie unsoziale Leistungsdenke.

LOL, ""Sozialromantik"" lasse ich mir gerne vorwerfen, von jemanden der emphatiefrei in der Illusion der Vollbeschäftigung verharrt und daraus Forderungen an Einzelene erhebt. Und wenn Du gegen das aktuelle Sozialsystem bist, nur weil es Beispiele des Missbrauchs gibt, dann bin ich auch für die Abschaffung der Universitäten, da es in Prüfungen regelmäßig zu Betrug kommt. Ehrlich gesagt, mit dem Geld der ""Bankenrettung"" könnten wir uns sehr viele Sesselfurzer leisten. Aber Du scheinst nur den Ärmsten ihre Sozialleistung zu neiden und darauf zu bestehen, dass das BGE nicht finanzierbar ist. Und selbst wenn es das nicht sei: von mir aus hänge ich lieber an einer Romantik als der neoliberalen Kälte, der den Wert von Menschen nur an ökonomischer Leistungsfähigkeit misst.

Aha, gelungene Außenpolitik ist also wenn keine Deutschen sterben.

Ein Krieg ist gelungene Sicherheitspolitik? Die vielen zivilen Opfer sind eben selbst schuld dass sie Iraker waren. Merkste selbst, oder?

It's also close to the ""Sauerland"", an area that's known for it's beautiful scenery. There won't be much going on in terms of culture or parties, and there's not much going on in a radius of about 50km.

A trip to Düsseldorf is 75km and one to Cologne is 90km, those are the only interesting places in a manageable distance.

If you want parties, Berlin is the place to be right now. 

Culturally, Germany is an extremely diverse country, the most interesting cities in terms of culture and history are probably Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Hamburg (in that order, imo). Berlin has an extremely diverse culture in itself, it feels like a very young city, like the place where all the world is meeting right now. Historically, it has lots to offer, both because of the wall and because of everything that came before it. History feels very alive in Berlin. Munich wasn't nearly destroyed as badly as Berlin was during the war, so you have more old buildings everywhere, and while it's also very diverse, the Bavarian culture still is everywhere, with Biergarten, Maß Bier, and everything. But while Berlin's official motto is ""poor but sexy"", Munich's official motto could be ""RICH."" - it's absolutely beautiful, but be prepared to spend about 1.5 to 2x what you would in Berlin. On everything. Düsseldorf and Cologne are fairly similar but never say that to anyone who's from there. Beautiful ""Altstadt"", the historical core of the city by the river Rhine, interesting beers and traditions about them (for example, Kölsch is a rather light, Lager-type beer that will come in tiny glasses that they will keep serving you as soon as your's is empty, until you say stop. Düsseldorf has ""Alt"", darker beers with more texture that I personally prefer over Kölsch), and all in all interesting and friendly culture. Hamburg I can't say much about, I haven't been there often enough to really speak for it.

Nein. Du reißt meine Sätze aus dem Zusammenhang. Im Irak/DPRK-Satz ging es um den Umstand, daß man sich nicht zum Opfer machen lassen muss. Insofern: Nordkorea's Atomwaffenprogramm ist gelungene Sicherheitspolitik (für Nordkorea).

[edit] Zitier mal die besten Stücke

&gt; In der Charité geht es darum, Alex sein „biologisches“ Geschlecht nahe zu bringen und „geschlechtsatypisches Verhalten“ zu „unterbinden“, erklärt Chefarzt Klaus Beier die Therapie.


&gt; Darauf weist etwa Klaus Beier hin, Sexualmediziner an der Berliner Charité. ""Wenn wir Kriterien hätten, die uns sicher sagen könnten, dass eine Geschlechtsidentitätsproblematik im Kindesalter später in eine Transsexualität übergeht, wäre die Gabe von pubertätsblockierenden Medikamenten verantwortbar"", sagt Mediziner Beier. ""Diese Kriterien haben wir aber nicht, sodass stets der denkbare Fall zugrunde gelegt werden muss, dass sich das Unbehagen im biologischen Geschlecht im Laufe der weiteren Entwicklung verlieren könnte."" 

Was ist denn das für ne Logik. ""Zwingen wir sie, als Mann aufzuwachsen. VIELLEICHT MAG SIE ES JA. ""

&gt; Alex wurde nie neutral begutachtet. Vor sechs Jahren sollte sie zu Tests in ein großes Berliner Krankenhaus: ""Die haben mir erzählt, ich würde als Mädchen später unglücklich. Da wollte ich nicht mehr mitmachen,"" sagt sie. 


&gt; ""Die stellten mich vor ein Regal: links rosa Prinzessinnen, rechts Autos. Ich soll entscheiden, womit ich spielen will, das ist doch lächerlich. Ich habe dann ein Puzzle gemacht.""

The Berlin Pirates want to completely slash the subventions of the [Deutsche Oper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Oper_Berlin). That's 39 million Euros, annual.

How much more *breadth* you can give cultural subventions by refusing to fund the old, same old stuff where all news and critiques there are deal about the bloody *staging* of said old pieces because that's the only interesting thing left, even for habitual high-browers?

Right now, culture is a thing that's done by an establishment for a rather small, and ever the same, audience. Actual culture, however, is a thing from the people for the people. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't have professionals, but damn they shouldn't dictate what culture is but use their expertise to lift amateur culture up a bit for everyone's benefit. At least as *part* of their job description.

If they do *that*, I bet they'll find themselves with a lot of things to be creative high-artsy about because the musings of the people are a never-ending source of inspiration.

In return, German conjugation is easy. We almost only use present and perfect tense, both are simple and quite regular. They require only to conjugate ""haben"" and ""sein"". (Austrian people sometimes seem to only use ""sein"")

My suggestion: Declination is simply too much to learn from a big list. I'd suggest to have a cheat sheet ready while practising with Germans. Have them correct you and try to get a feeling for it.

That's the thing, austerity is never, ever, the solution. You have a crisis, where consumption is low, what do you do? Cut government programs, jobs and maybe even salaries? It's like saying, I'm hungry, I should not eat for a couple of days, maybe my hunger will go away. 
I'm not saying that you need to borrow money, but you can cut the military's budget, cut government programs which under perform so you have more money to invest, and get your economy kick started again.         
             
I know it's probably not the best example, but China has been spending tremendous amounts of money on infrastructure and housing projects, way too much, just to keep their GDP in the double digit number, without any real programs to help people get the new constructed houses, hence their ghost cities, and because all of that spent money they have a functioning economy, growing at a massive pace and have not been affected by the crisis (which should have affected them dearly, as they export to a lot of the western countries, and at most, their trade balance dipped in the negative a couple of quarters ago).

the way the g8 system was introduced really fucked with the ongoing education of many german pupils, because it was changed during kids education, instead of just determining that the next generation of pupils would have 12 years and planning this from the 1st to the 12th grade they just changed it for kids which were in 6th or 8th grade, completely fucking up the curriculum. seriously, i have pretty deep knowledge of the effects this had on the german school system, and they are all bad.

the problem with the german school system is that is is not regulated enough. try raising your kids in schleswig-holstein till they are 10 years old and then move to bayern, your kids will be completely lost as we are unable to have an education standard for the entire nation, every state government does what it wants with the system (because its one of the few things were the länder have more authority than the bund) and few of them are compatible

I won't argue with this, as a teacher you are very knowledgable on this subject. However as i said i got my Abitur in a G8 project in which our curriculum was condensed into one less year, after skipping the 11th grade and joining with the regular pupils in the 12th most of us were above average grade wise. I'm not regretting this decision but at the same time i realize it is not suited for everyone, especially pupils who need more time to understand things. That's why i'd prefer to have the choice.

&gt;the problem with the german school system is that is is not regulated enough. try raising your kids in schleswig-holstein till they are 10 years old and then move to bayern, your kids will be completely lost as we are unable to have an education standard for the entire nation, every state government does what it wants with the system (because its one of the few things were the länder have more authority than the bund) and few of them are compatible

How do you think that would average out? Will the quality level converge to that of Bavaria or that of Schleswig-Holstein. If the quality of the bavarian system is higher, why don't other states emulate that?

&gt;imho healthcare should be completely nationalized and public, the way its split into private and public right now is just bullshit. right now we have a situation in which many former privately insured ""selbstständige"" can't afford their insurances anymore and suddenly the public system has to catch them while the private insurance companies try to only get the customers that are young and healthy

Agreed. That's why i think it should be completely privatized to make it 1. more affordable for everyone and 2. better. A mashup between private and public is almost never good, because the private companies lack the incentives to take on markets that will be more costly to them. This pseudo-privatization isn't really good. On the other hand i will admit that even the national health care is very good in Germany, we have more doctors per inhabitants than the US for example.

Of course people who cannot afford insurance would have to be taken care of via monetary help, so that everyone can be insured. 

&gt;and when i look at the current financial and euro crisis, many companies and banks were able to fuck up our economy because they were not regulated enough. the banks had free reign and look where it got us

This is a very complex topic, which i have been reading on for a year now, but i still wouldn't claim to understand it fully much less give an educated opinion about. However, who bailed the banks out? Who sent rescue-packet after rescue-packet when Greece defaulted anyway? Which magic regulation is supposed to get rid of anything?

There is not unanimous opinion that more regulation would have helped. Why are the governments so dependant on the good will of the markets? Why do they need to borrow and refinance huge sums of money regularly? Why is it unacceptable for a bank to get suspicious if a country has enormous debt that it cannot possibly repay and therefore stop lending? What is the central banks role in this?

I've just watched 2 hour TV interview with a few dozen representatives from various political parties and other organizations and nobody was able to convincingly explain changes that the laws would bring. Supposedly new laws would enable children to form a family in same sex marriages, although proponents of the law (generally left side) claim that this is not the case as the law would merely fix issues related to children living already with one biological parent. Another improvement proponents claim would be in courts having much more power in taking children from abusive families, those against it claim that the area is already adequately solved with currents laws and that new laws would give too much power to the state. Opponents of the law claim that the law would enable trade with children objectifying both children and mothers, proponents claim it would fix arrangements people already live in. In all I think this was not so much about rights of gay people as it was about rights of children and what is best for them. Before I thought the opponents were mildly xenophobic and rejecting it would be a step backwards and a source of embarrassment for Slovenia, now I think the laws were rejected because new laws wouldn't bring major change and don't grant significant new rights to gay community.
