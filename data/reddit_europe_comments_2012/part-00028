Of course there were bad apples that exacerbated their fiscal state. What I'm arguing is that the vast majority of Greeks had little to do with the state of their affairs. It isn't fair to blame ten million people for the problems that a few created. It is these people who are now suffering unjustly and unnecessarily. It's like blaming 310 million Americans for the financial crisis that was created by a lack of regulation and an abundance of bad decisions by businesses.

&gt;when you say the past several governments in a democracy, don't forget that these Greeks have voted for these governments. voted for the guys who'd get them short term benefits above the long term financial safety of the country.

Let's not forget that the revelations that several, successive governments lied repeatedly to various organizations, including the Greek public, did not come until after the fact. How does the fact that people voted for the offending parties give them any sort of responsibility when the parties lied to the voters? Should I blame the American people for the problems their country has endured because they voted for one of two parties? Is it really the voters fault that a government does much of what it does? Of course not. They vote for parties or individuals with the intent that they will represent their own political views better than anyone else on the ballot. Modern democracies are not government by the people. They are representative democracies. If the 10 million Greek citizens had concluded with each other as a collective to lie to Eurostat about their fiscal order, then I would agree that the Greek people are to blame, but this is not the case. It's not my fault that my representative isn't a perfect representative of my political ideology. It's simply reality. Political systems don't just change on a dime. Much of the time you have to work with what you've got, as sad as that is. The Greeks, Spanish, Portuguese, Irish and Italians all have to make do with the parties that helped get them into this whole mess. Such is the nature of these institutions.

First off, I consider my compatriots who do actually use that hateful and ugly stereotype to be rather stupid and narrow-minded. This is the same crowd that burns the German flag or distorts the EU flag to include the swastika in the various protests.

But do bear in mind that these people are in the minority. The quite small and insignificant minority. Thus I make plea that you should not believe that this juvenile and hateful behavior is somehow characteristic of all Greeks. It's not. Never will be. Of all the people that I know and talk to, none has ever brought that stereotype up. If anything I read about it more in the foreign papers that I come across it here in Greece.

My opinion is that it's more likely a selection bias from the various journalists rather than an occurrence of any significance. In the same sense that every time there is a protest here in Athens and a couple of idiots throw a molotov or two (or quite more) it is reported, with out fail, that the capital is on fire. It's not. I have been in protests and I have been around them. Nothing of  the sort of mayhem and chaos that media report. I understand that it sells papers but let's have a common understanding that they blow things *way* out of proportion. 

And the later is actually really bad because it distracts from the main issues that should be on focus. 

So dear German redditors my apologies on behalf of my not-so-bright countrymen. Keep in mind they are a very-very limited minority. The crushing majority does not spout nonsenses like those.

Might I also ask of you thought (fellow German redditors) that you too drop this rather inaccurate and generalizing characterization of Greeks as lazy? It's really not true. And it's been rather hurtful. I have been witnessing for the past two years a character assassination of the Greek people using various insults and it feels like a tide that cannot be turned back. It has kept me from /worldnews for quite some time.

It would be much better if there was an immediate and sudden default, seizure and nationalization of all ambiguous and ""shadow"" assets. That however would also require the expulsion of Greece from the Euro which would create a huge pile of problems which, in the end,would be solvable only through war. 
Most of the noise about Nazis is really the media projecting (and trying to shift cause-effect externally) because the people of Greece are torn and there is too much internal strife, so an external enemy is sought to focus on that (does that remind you of something?).
As long as everyone is blaming and punishing Greece in the way it is done, be prepared for an extreme right-wing movement gaining momentum and finally taking power. So long as Bild (and anyone else) is presenting a huge diversionary target for them to exploit, they will rise. The fact that no-one is accepting ever the (even minor) role these German corporations played in the whole shebang just allows more false justifications to enter the game. i. e. "" Look at them, even when they were deep in the shit with us they are pointing only at us and telling us we stink while they think they smell like roses. Fuck 'em, they are assholes, no need to listen to them.""

When they finally get into government then the necessary brain capital will have already fled the country (leaving desperate conservative outsider-haters as the majority), there will be no liberal/left wing political presence and Orban/ Le Pen or Wilders will look like a soft and caring person that respects other's rights and promotes cultural integration.

true,CountVonTroll,null,null,"Leipzig is great. Of course it's not Berlin, but most people I know see this as a plus, and it's still large enough to have a fun time out at night. It really is a beautiful city, and it has a high quality of life, especially from a student perspective, while being much cheaper than any other city of that size.

For when you look for a room in a shared apartment (""WG""), you should know a bit about the interesting parts of the city. The ones where you would spend a night out in are also the ones preferable for living. If you look at a [map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=leipzig&amp;ll=51.324819,12.353783&amp;spn=0.032289,0.077076&amp;hnear=Leipzig,+Saxony,+Germany&amp;t=m&amp;z=14), those are roughly the areas going from the center clockwise around the park up to Karl-Heine-Straße (avoid anything North of that street) -- Südvorstadt (and Connewitz to the South of it, where the vegans live), Schleußig (where people move when they get pregnant) and Plagwitz (the not-quite-new-anymore hip, since gentrification has raged in Südvorstadt). The inner parts within that angle are OK as well, Zentrum-Süd and Zentrum-West. Most places you'll ever go to, and most people you'll study with, will be in those districts. The time to walk between Plagwitz and Südvorstadt is about 30-45 minutes, so that's doable even without a bike (buy a good lock, seriously) or public transport.

As for travel, Leipzig-Halle is a nearby airport, and Leipzig itself is directly at main railway connections. Others have mentioned InterConnex already, which is an independent railway operator that will take you to Berlin for cheap. For others destinations, if you prefer rail to [organized hitch-hiking](http://www.mitfahrzentrale.de/index.php?landnr=D&amp;lang=GB) for gas money, you can get cheap connections by booking early in advance at [Bahn](http://www.bahn.de/i/view/DEU/en/index.shtml). E.g., there's a direct connection to Frankfurt, from where you can take a TGV to Paris or Marseille, and if you book a month early this will cost you only €50 (one way).  
For spontaneous trips, as in pack your stuff, print out a ticket and go, Bahn is more expensive, so consider a [BahnCard](http://www.bahn.de/i/view/DEU/en/prices/germany/bahncard.shtml) if you plan on doing that. They come in a 25%-off and a 50%-off variant. A four-month trial for the BC25 costs €25, student prices (bring your student ID card) for a full year are €39 for the BC25 and €122 for the BC50 -- but be careful, they work on a subscription model, so make sure to cancel it in time.",0,1331471929,null,0,false,0,c3zurku,t3_qr5o0,t1_c3zurku,t3_qr5o0,null,1428505014,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

true,Norrsken,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;you are focusing on the wrong part of the equation. It is not the guilt trip that is important, no-one is saying that Greece is not at fault.

It *is* important. You said *the main culprits* were foreign firms. That means that you are absolving the blame from the Greeks. 


The one who caused this, and the ones who can fix this, is the Greeks. If you keep blaming others, you do not take your responsibility, nor do you embrace the changes you'll have to do.


&gt;What you should be focusing on is the after effects of the continued and prolonged punishment.

I agree that it's not fun for the Greeks right now, but what do you mean is the punishment? That your pensions are lowered? They were the highest in the OECD! That you'll fire 150 000 civil servants? According to another OECD report you have a barely funtioning state, although you have 700 000 civil servants. What do they actually do? Why have you been paying them for all those years? Why do you keep people that do not work?

I can understand that things are not fun, but no one forced you to raise salaries, to avoid building up competetive industries, to raise pensions, to retire earlier, borrow money, constant budget deficit. I am stunned, and chocked when I see Greeks protesting things we've had for decades, like property tax, retirement at 65 (we have 67), higher taxes (you are still lower than ours btw), higher VAT etc. So, is the punishment to have things like we have them?


&gt;Most of the noise about Nazis is really the media projecting (and trying to shift cause-effect externally) because the people of Greece are torn and there is too much internal strife, so an external enemy is sought to focus on that (does that remind you of something?).


I suppose you are referring to the 30's and the Nazi, and a) *all* countries do that in time of crises, and, as I did point out earlier, I don't think *all* Greeks agree with what some papers say b) I am not German.


&gt;The fact that no-one is accepting ever the (even minor) role these German corporations played in the whole shebang just allows more false justifications to enter the game. 


I *do* accept it (as with Goldman Sachs, French banks etc) but what your wrote were *Greece's corruption was facilitated mainly by Siemens and other Western Europe corporations,*


The keyword is *mainly*. You are saying that more than half of the blame lies outside of Greece. And, I say that is wrong. Not saying that they are perfect, but mainly *the Greeks* are to blame.

I honestly I have no clue what you mean with this? Are you saying that you are going to turn into a fourth Reich? You also implied that ""those who do not know history tend to repeat it"". Is Greece turning inot Weimar and then you'll try to take over the world? Or are you trying to imply that I as a German (which I am not, one can think the Greek references to Nazi's are wrong anyway) should know this?Or are you implying that  the Germans are trying to invade you?

It is therefore based on the predominate social structure of that time, hence the sterilisation and divorce requirements (or you might end up with scenarios that would have been unthinkable in the 1960s such as a legal male having a child or two people of the same legally recognised gender being married to each other). But since those norms no longer apply to our culture and same-sex marriages are now completely legal the parliament is in the process of passing a new law to replace the old one that better reflects modern attitudes.

Yes it does. If something is offensive or not is determined by culture and not inherent to the presumably offensive term itself. 

Since Germany didn't do the whole slavery and abducting african natives thing on this scale there are also few blacks in Germany. This means there was also never widespread hate or racial segregation. The reason certain terms are offensive to american ears are because they were used in a derogatory way and as insults and came to stand for that racial hate. This has not happened in Germany. The word ""Neger"" has fallen out of use in Germany because it is not considered politically correct anymore. Not because of our bad experiences with it but because of the stigma associated with that word in the english language, especially the US. There are plenty of languages where negro or any variation thereof still simply means a black person without any negative conotations. You can also get away with saying it on German national TV just fine.

2) Intentions

While it might be soothing for you to explain your intention, no one should care beyond you. Facts matter, not intention, and you posted this map, period.

Back to facts: look again at my post, and you'll realize that while I heavily criticize the map and its associated methodology (or lack thereof, at least regarding France), I never stated or implied anything about your intentions.

Should I become offended that you're reading too much into my post? ;-)

We're obviously both supporting equality; why are we having this discussion again? 

3) Shades of grey

There's a small misunderstanding there. I didn't mean that countries were divided in good guys and bad guys. I meant that each criteria in the table is given a very small number of discrete values (most of them just booleans.)

Let's take adoption by same-sex couples as an example. The courts have said that it can't be forbidden. Cool. But real couples trying to adopt still face such difficulties that an extremely small number have yet to receive the agreement.

Some same-sex couples will have a competent lawyer and support from experts, and they'll end up navigating favorably the bureaucratic nightmare of the agreement procedure. Most other won't, just because of the institutional prejudice of the social workers.

So, how should I grade France on this point?

Le coup de la préhistoire, ca joue sur nos genes, notre developpement morphologique, je parle pas de nos comportements. sinon, comment expliquer cette différence? dans les sociétés animales ( je pense plus aux insectes) la femelle est plus forte physiquement que le male lorsqu'elle doit subvenir seule a ses besoins.
Je ne réfute absoluement pas qu'une femme puisse etre égale ou superieure a un homme dans des domaines qui habituellement leurs sont reservés..

Ca me rappelle une manif, ou cote a cote, y'avait 2 femmes, brandissant 2 panneaux: 
1 disait: l'homme est un porc machiste et degoutant.
l'autre: la femme est l'égal de l'homme.
""Egalité ne signifie pas non plus mettre tout le monde au même niveau"" par définition, si.
Tu parles d'équité.
Coupe un gateau en part égale, et celui qui a faim aura autant a manger que celui qui n'a pas faim.
Coupe en part équitable, et tout le monde mange a sa faim.

Pour citer un passage de la définition: 
En matière politique ou économique, l'équité est le principe qui conduit à corriger des inégalités que subissent des personnes ou des groupes défavorisés (exemple : le commerce équitable).

L'égalité n'est possible que dans un monde de clones communistes.
Pour citer le film stalingrad (jude law toussa), même lorsqu'on possède tous la meme chose, on est jamais égaux devant le talent, la beauté, l'humour, et ce seront toujours des choses que nous pourrons envier.

Physiologiquement, l'homme et la femme sont différents, ont des besoins différents, et se comportent différement (le fait que les hommes se repèrent mieux en 3 dimensions, par exemple, mais sont moins capable de faire 2 choses a la fois ont été prouvés..).

Je soutiens (globalement) le mouvement visant a rétablir l'équité entre hommes et femmes, mais le débat est faussé des deux cotés.

- Mercado maravillas. a block from cuatro caminos in the direction of plaza castilla down bravo murillo, one of the bigger normal food markets in madrid, while san miguel and san anton are more tourist and show oriented this is actually a down to earth market with real stuff. you should be able to find proper spanish food there for cheaper. you will even find south american and even some asian food stands, last time i went i had some awesome decent chicken tamales there. just remember to go early becuase it closes during the afternoon. 

Bravo murillo is also interesting becuase its a long street running from cuatro caminos to plaza castilla and its mostly filled with cheap clothing shops. 

even if you dont want to do the arty stuff. you can take the 27 bus which runs between atocha and plaza castilla all along the paseo del prado and castellana, its the main avenue of northen madrid and will let you check out several important monuments and plazas like cibeles, colon, it runs along the retiro park in the first few blocks from atocha, it passes next to the museo del prado. the central mail, you can see banco de españa and puerta de alcala when it crosses with alcala st.

If you have a valid driver's license and need a car here you might be interested in car sharing. For Leipzig that's www.teilauto.net - they have special offers for students. I found that to be extremly useful at times because you have a wide choice of cars you rent for quite cheap.

Dafür störte er sich aber an einem Vergleich Scherfs, der in der Diskussion über den Ehrensold sagte, dass er die Gehälter von Politikern im Vergleich zu denen von vielen Managern oder Fernsehstars für zu niedrig hält.

&gt; Jauch verdiene pro Jahr ""das Vielfache"" von dem, was die Bundeskanzlerin verdiene. Und Jauch halte das auch noch für gerecht, sagte Scherf und bekam dafür viel Applaus. ""Das wissen Sie ja gar nicht. Ich hab' mich zu der Gerechtigkeitsnummer noch nie geäußert"", reagierte Jauch leicht irritiert. ""Ich habe mich aber auch noch nie beklagt.""

&gt; Auch Ramelow attackiert den Talkmaster
Während der Moderator diesen Seitenhieb noch einigermaßen locker wegsteckte, reagierte er bei einem zweiten Seitenhieb spürbar unwirsch. Es ging um die Frage, was einem Politiker von einem Skandal haften bleibt und ob Wulff überhaupt eine Chance für einen Neuanfang hat.

&gt; Während Altmaier und Scherf für den Altbundespräsidenten noch Möglichkeiten für die Zukunft sehen, kramte Linken-Politiker Ramelow in einer lange zurückliegenden Episode aus Jauchs Fernsehschaffen. ""Ich wollte Ihnen aus Erfurt einen Born-Senf mitbringen"", sagte Ramelow. Worauf er anspielte: Bei ""Stern TV"" war Jauch dem Filmfälscher Michael Born aufgesessen, der in der RTL-Sendung gefälschte Dokumentarfilme unterbrachte.

&gt; ""Es ist die Frage, was bleibt einem haften?"", begründete Ramelow seine Anmerkung. Unwirsches Kopfschütteln war das Einzige, was Jauch zu diesem überraschenden Angriff auf seine Integrität einfiel.

&gt; Die Attacke des Linken-Politikers war auch denkbar unpassend: Denn während Jauch trotz des Skandals ungehindert zum Fernsehliebling Nummer 1 aufstieg, traut Wulff wohl kaum jemand ein politisches Comeback zu.

&gt; Doch Mitleid hat sich Jauch auch nicht verdient. Denn der Einschub Ramelows kam in der letzten Viertelstunde der Sendung. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt war das Thema Wulf so dermaßen durchgekaut, dass Jauch besser die Sendung vorzeitig beendet hätte. Es wäre ein Novum gewesen - aber ein zur abgebrochenen Amtszeit Wulffs passendes. ",0,1331553507,null,0,false,0,c405lko,t3_qssvp,t1_c405lko,t3_qssvp,null,1428510362,2,false,de,t5_22i0,2

But as far as I know sell normal bike shops their bicycles already ""complete"". 
A racing bike is also required to be very light weighted, the handlebars are not even a must requirement. And in the wilderness (every road that is not made of stone) those bikes are pretty useless.

Madrid businesses are usualy open from 10-10:30am to 8-10pm. the smaller shops start closing at 8pm while the large malls open till 10pm. as for that picture, it looks like the maravillas food market on bravo murillo, it opens very early and closes around mid day, but basicly becuase its a common food market. 

Living in spain is Cheap. living in Madrid isnt.

Rent for a room is like 350-400 a month and for an apartment its 700-800, food is like 200 a month, then you have utilities which add another 200 (eletricity, water, gas, phone). free access to public transport starts from around 47 euros a month and can go up to 140 depending on where in madrid you are (you have to be pretty far around for that 140 buck pass, most people do with the 47)

&gt;I wasn't referring to the articles you provided, it was just based on an average of friends and family living there.

Well, provide sources please.How on earth am I suppose to know what you are talking about. How is that a) in relation to the articles b) where does that number comes from? OECD reports?


&gt;first off I assume there aren't that many people who make 1800 a year in Sweden (right?), are you talking about 18 year olds? 

I was comparing it to Greece - and the articles I pointed out. I, as a working student start paying taxes as soon as I make more than €1800 per*year*. In Greece, you start paying when you make something like *12 000*/year. I'd never ever have to pay taxes if we had your system, . Also, I support Greece, why? Don't tell me their tax evasion is minor, it's a lot of bloody money for me to pay taxes, and I don't see a single reason why I should give money to someone who cheats. It is not minor!


&gt;what I meant was the tax being paid by those who make that much (even up to a more reasonable low income) cannot attribute to the deep corruption in Greece at all. It's more important on a basis of principal if anything.


No. If Greece started to pay the taxes you'll have no more budget deficit. It is not minor. Your level of start paying taxes is absurdly high, you have to lower it. Second, in those other articles as well (and I can provide you with an endless number of links as well, but I'll wait) it prove that the corruption is everywhere. An example, of the top of my head is that Greece has a barely functioning state (according to OECD report) but 700 000 people who work there. That is just not the politicians. Also you do not get a shadow economy of *25 %* (!!!!!!) because of the politicians and foreign firms. I can provide you with link after link of corruptions among ordinary people, and no, since it's everywhere it's not minor- it's everywhere.

1) people conventionally think that the US and Europe are totally different. 

2) Talking about ""Europe"" is problematic in any case, because it is not a homogenic entity.

3) Neither is the US. But when commentators talk about the US, suddenly difference between states are ignored.

4) With those two previous points in mind, let's see if the US falls somewhere into the ""European spectrum"", i.e. could we imagine that the US could be another European nation. Conclusion: yes. None of the data points we looked at fall significantly outside of the spectrum found in other European countries.

5) Caveat: You could still argue that the **combination** of data point is unique, i.e. there is no single EU nation that is exactly like the US, but that was never in question: of course the US is unique, just as Greece or France is unique.


Alright, done. See how easy that was? Now, please, tell me how there is ""cherry picking"" going on, when the whole point of the article could be boiled down to the simple statement ""Nothing about the US is so outrageously un-European that you can't find equivalent stats in Europe"".

Also, the main source of the outrage of the Polish minority in Lithuania, as it pertains to minority schools (publicly funded, mind you), is that the Polish students will have to pass the same state language exam as the native speakers, as opposed to an easier version. Having seen quite a few Polish-speaking Lithuanians, whose families have been living here for at least three generations, not being able to speak Lithuanian fluently, I think this change is long overdue.

The Polish minority's case is further devalued by their abuse of the Polish language, which, in practice for them, means a mix of Polish, Russian and Lithuanian that a native speaker of any one of the mentioned languages would fail to fully understand. Case in point: the protesters, which the article mentions, were protesting with sings written mostly in Russian. It is for reasons like these, that some of my acquaintances, who previously considered themselves a part of the Polish minority are now trying to distance themselves form it.

It doesn't help, that some municipality in a mostly Polish speaking region of Lithuania issued a statement, saying that it recognizes it's responsibility to Jesus above participation in the nation's government structure, which would be a despicable statement regardless of the ethnicity of the official responsible. Actually, it's no wonder that it was a Polish official, considering the average religiosity among Poles. As much as I'd like for the Poles to have a healthy community involved in our state affairs, I fear it's impossible because of such statements, made by their supposed representatives.

**EDIT:** Also, check out the comments in the original article made by senior_otter, which in my opinion are representative of the general attitude of the minority. Considering my remarks about religion above, let me quote him on this point:

&gt; it is just that the Greek people refuse to acknowledge they've brought the situation upon themselves

First of all, it's ridiculous that you're even suggesting that the Greeks were the only ones responsible for the situation they found themselves in. What about the imbalances in monetary policy? What about the de facto lack of competitiveness against the huge multinationals of other countries? 

Second of all, the Greeks have been more than willing to share their fair share of responsibility. I've seen Greeks being overly apologetic, saying stuff like they didn't deserve the infrastructure that was built etc. But you can't expect them to bear all the burden by themselves and you should know better. 

&gt; by cheating on their taxes at every opportunity

Yes, tax evasion is a huge problem in Greece. But with that said, [less than 30% of the Greek population has even the opportunity to cheat their taxes](http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/ESYE/BUCKET/A0101/PressReleases/A0101_SJO01_DT_QQ_02_2007_01_F_EN.pdf); the rest are either wage earners (whose tax is automatically deducted from their wage) and housewives/children/etc (who don't have an income). 

&gt; repeatedly voting in crooks

The political promises in Greece have been focused around combating corruption and fighting tax evasion for decades. The Greeks have repeatedly voted out of office people based on perceived corruption during their time in the government and they have also voted in people when they declared they would clean up everything and ""reinstate the state"" as they called it. 

&gt; that cooked the books to be allowed into the EU

You probably mean the eurozone, not the EU. Even so, [there was no cooking of books to enter the eurozone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_greece#Eurozone_entry) (at least, there is no evidence of it). At the same time, there's plenty of evidence that the rest of the Europeans knew the deficiencies of the Greek economy all too well before letting Greece in. 

&gt; Most Greek people see themselves as completely blameless for the situation (behaving like a spoiled child), so mother Europe that has to clean up their mess is punishing them. This cartoon fits well.

2. Spotify hat in ihrer Desktop Software inzwischen auch sogenannte Apps (eigentlich eher Plugins) welche z.B. Verbindung mit Last.fm, Moodagent, Tunewiki usw hat. Das macht besonders das finden neuer Musik viel einfacher ...

3. Spotify ermöglicht das teilen von Playlists. Habe hier schon mehrmals auf Reddit Playlists gefunden, die ich einfach anklicke und sofort sind sie bei mir in spotify. Diese Playlists sind aber nicht statisch, sondern können weiterhin gepflegt werden. Finde ich das ""killer""-Feature gegenüber Simfy

4. Spotify bindet die lokale Musikbibliothek mit ein

5. Ein aspekt den ich jetzt noch nicht ""genießen"" konnte, weil ich der einzige unter meinen Freunden bin, der Spotify nutzt ist, dass das ganze Programm sehr auf das soziale netz getrimmt ist und man somit leicht anderen musik empfehlen kann usw.

Wikipedia definition of Fascism (first few paragraphs)-


&gt;Fascism ( /ˈfæʃɪzəm/) is a radical authoritarian nationalist political ideology.[1][2] Fascists seek rejuvenation of their nation based on commitment to an organic national community where its individuals are united together as one people in national identity by suprapersonal connections of ancestry, culture, and blood through a totalitarian single-party state that seeks the mass mobilization of a nation through discipline, indoctrination, physical education, and eugenics.[3][4] Fascism seeks to purify the nation of foreign influences that are deemed to be causing degeneration of the nation or of not fitting into the national culture.[5] Fascism promotes political violence and war, as forms of direct action that create national regeneration, spirit and vitality.[3][6] Fascists commonly utilize paramilitary organizations for violence against opponents or to overthrow a political system.[7] Fascism opposes multiple ideologies: conservatism, liberalism, and two major forms of socialism—communism and social democracy.[8] Fascism claims to represent a synthesis of cohesive ideas previously divided between traditional political ideologies.[9] To achieve its goals, the fascist state purges forces, ideas, people, and systems deemed to be the cause of decadence and degeneration.[10]
The fascist party is a vanguard party designed to initiate a revolution from above and to organize the nation upon fascist principles.[11] The fascist party and state is led by a supreme leader who exercises a dictatorship over the party, the government and other state institutions.[12] Fascists reject conventional democracy that is based on majority rule.[13][14] Fascists claim to advocate an authoritarian democracy based on rule of the most qualified, rather quantitative majority rule, though multiple scholars are strongly skeptical of fascism's claims to be democratic.[14][15][16][17][18][19] Fascism supports a socially united collective national society and opposes socially divided class-based societies and socially-divided individualist-based societies.[20] Fascists claim it is a trans-class movement, advocating resolution to domestic class conflict within a nation to secure national solidarity.[21] While fascism opposes domestic class conflict, it favours a proletarian national culture and claims that its goal of nationalizing society emancipates the nation's proletariat, and promotes the assimilation of all classes into proletarian national culture.[21] It opposes contemporary bourgeois class-based society and culture for allegedly being based on selfish and hedonistic individualism that results in plutocracy and war profiteering at the expense of the nation.[22] Fascism claims that bourgeois-proletarian conflict primarily exists in national conflict between proletarian nations versus bourgeois nations; fascism declares support for the victory of proletarian nations.[23]
Fascists advocate a state-directed, regulated economy that is dedicated to the nation; the use and primacy of regulated private property and private enterprise contingent upon service to the nation or state, the use of state enterprise where private enterprise is failing or is inefficient, and autarky. It supports criminalization of strikes by employees and lockouts by employers because it deems these acts as prejudicial to the national community.[24]

Now more seriously, yes, Portuguese is very similar to Spanish but not in this case, you read José as you read John.

If you have no light and no reflectors you are basically invisible in the dark. But I understand your concerns, because I ride bicycles in Germany my whole life. With modern bikes the regulations seem to add a lot of clutter to your bike, but the laws aren't enforced that hard, so relax.

For spoke reflectors you can get [this](http://www.acelo-shop.com/Photos/20_F30_Beleuchtung/sekuclip-montage_640x480.JPG). They work and look very unobtrusive at daylight.

Pedal reflectors shouldn't be a big deal. You get them on shiny metal pedals, too. If you use clipless pedals, you can get [reflectors](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31FXeTQNGpL.jpg) for everyday use that you can remove if you do sports.

Also there is a more recent rule that you have front/back reflectors. You can get small reflectors that will do the job.

Police will check for reflectors and normally will be satisfied if you have any. 

I never had a bell/horn on my MTB and no one ever cared. Either my brakes are loud or I can shout, but a bell doesn't improve safety. You can use it to make people jump if you have a quiet bike and sneak up on them but since I drive defensively I just slow down until I can overtake e.g. pedestrians.

Just buy battery light and everyone will be fine. A lot of people drive without lights and battery lights are really good. I never heard that someone got a fine because he was using a battery light instead of one with a dynamo on something other than a light-weight racing bike. FYI, [this](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/aurora-ak-p7-5-ha-iii-ssc-p7-c-2-mode-900-lumen-led-flashlight-with-assault-crown-1-18650-15739) is my bike light. Extremely bright.

No one cares for fenders and if you make yourself dirty or not.

Trust me with a working battery light and some reflectors no police man will ever disturb you. There are so many people without light despite the regulations. Of course, if you really piss the police off they could fine but the chance of this happening is near zero. My student home and my university was next to the police station and there was only one incident where one older police man on foot wanted to fine me. I had my battery light with me, but the batteries died half way into my trip. I argued a little bit and he took a look at my bike and send me away without fine. But then you should push until out of sight.

And in my case I was talking about my MTB. In the forest I don't have my lights with me. The reflectors on the spokes are not noticeable. The ones on the pedals are off. Never had a problem, but then there is no police in the woods. But beware that you stay on paths in the forest. Don't go ""cross country"". But there should be plenty of gravel and muddy paths available.",0,1331585160,null,0,false,0,c40axds,t3_qsz4c,t1_c40axds,t3_qsz4c,null,1435732277,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

I can confirm that grow shops are perfectly legal, as there is one in my town that sells seeds, grow equipment and paraphernalia.

I had answered Tagami who claimed that the *main fault* was the European firms, not the Greeks. 

I disagreed with this, and to prove my point I had two articles that pointed out that the corruption was rampant and everywhere, they had a huge shadow economy and tax evasion was done by everybody (+ one about their place on the Corruption list)

You answered that with: 

&gt;If you think uncollected income tax from some people who make 600 Euros a month is responsible you are surely mistaken.


Mistaken how? I had never said that collecting income tax from people who make 600/month is responsible, so why do you claim that? You ""accused me"" for lack of a better word, of something I had never said, nor is it mentioned in the articles. You seem to be having this argument in your head with me, based on the fact that you have a nice friend there, while I am trying to argue that statistically, millions and millions of Greeks cheat. That said, in one of the articles it's mentiond that they start paying taxes at € 12 000, something that does piss me of, since we start paying at about 1/7 of that. So yes, they should start paying at 1800/year too, so your friend should pay it as well. I work as a dog too, and I pay taxes, why shouldn't they (since we give money to them).


&gt;I have a friend who's 23, is from a tiny mountain village, works like a dog in the closest ""city"" available, and makes end's meat.

And because of that you claim that they should pay less taxes than I, that their shadow economy really isn't any fault of their own?  I have assumed that since you argued with me, that you disagree with the contesnts of the articles, but if that is not the case, sorry. If you do, just please provide me with sources.


They argument I am having is that they should pay as much as least as we do, not cheat and accept that they are responsible for their own mess. They got into it, and they can also get themselves out of it, I'm sure, but it doesn't work if you blame it all on foreigners. One has to take responsibility for one's situation.




&gt;The last thing I'll say is you're right, corruption is everywhere, all over the world, so don't just look at it exclusive to Greece.

Greece is number 80 on the list and they are *receiving money*. Most of the other ""first world countries"" are not there, so no, it is exceptionally bad, unless one compares them to Moldovia, Albania or Bulgaria. The US is number 24 and Germany is 14.

As a Greek I'm not condoning any of those racist cartoons and I am deeply saddened by the increasing number of extremists coming both from the left and the right.

You are deeply misinformed about the Euro crisis. For the good of the entire of Europe I beg you to study the matter in more detail and from less biased sources than your government. Things are not as simple as you'd like them to be. The war here is not between Greeks and Germans, it's between the European middle-class and the banking sector. 

First of all, you should know that Germany started the game of stereotyping when Merkel created the narrative of Greeks being the lazy grasshopper to be saved by Germany, the industrious ant, a narrative that is completely off-target. Greeks work more hours than Germans and also take less vacation days (check the OECD 2008 study). That's not because we're more hard-working people, but simply because... we're poorer. And poor people have to work more to survive. (As a tip, don't pick arguments that rely on the 'character of the nation' when you can pick arguments that rely on common sense. Your comment is mildly racist at times, even if that wasn't your intention or even if you think that your racism has any empirical validity.) Contrary to popular belief, Greece did not lie to adopt the Euro. With the accounting techniques used when Greece was introduced to the Euro, Greece's deficit was less than 3%. Check the Wikipedia page ""Economy of Greece"" for more details. 

The Greek government, no matter how corrupt and terrible it may be, did not cause the crisis. How do I know that? Because I asked myself the obvious: if Greece is paying the consequences for its terrible government (or lazy citizens), then why is Italy, Spain, Ireland, and Portugal suffering a crisis as well? They can't be *all* that lazy and fiscally irresponsible. It can't be that only Germany has hard-working citizens. 

The truth is that the Euro itself was established so that Germany can get rich while the southern countries get poorer. Don't trust me, Nobel Prize-winning economists such as Krugman and Stiglitz have written about it. Here's how it works: Germany is more competitive than Greece. So more people buy German goods than Greek goods. If the two countries had separate currencies, then Greece could devalue its currency to make its goods more competitive. But in a shared currency environment, that is impossible. So Germany keeps selling more exports and building its economy while Greece cannot catch up and can't do anything about it because it doesn't have any over its currency. To add to that, German companies are loaning irresponsibly to Greece in order for Greeks to buy their products (this is called a vendor financing scheme). So capital flows from Greece to Germany uncontrollably and Germany develops a trade surplus. And slowly Greece goes broke. 

For more information check [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/feb/18/europe-lazy-spendthrifts-germany).

I'm not saying that *YOU* got rich. As you said, German wages haven't gone up at all in the past 20 years. Big German companies got rich. Again, it's not a nation struggle, it's a class struggle. 

Germany is not helping Greece. Germany is helping the European banks. The bailout money will not go to the Greek people, it will go towards paying back the debt. The austerity that the German government along with the ECB and the IMF imposed has made the lives of the Greek middle class miserable, bringing unemployment to unsustainable levels and transforming Greece from the country with the lowest number of suicides to the country with the highest number. Things became that bad *because* of the austerity, not *despite* of it. 

Germany got most of its debts forgiven after the WWII. The US Marshall Plan gave Germany enough money so that its economy could stand on its feet. Think about this: nations were so generous to Germany despite all the atrocities that Germany committed in the WWII. And yet you feel that Greece, which hasn't done anything remotely as bad, doesn't deserve to be saved. You think you're being reasonable, but you are not.

I didn't wanted to appear incompetent about Lithuanian-Polish relationships, but still I think that two languages or two signs will never work in Baltics.

maybe it is just Baltic feeling, but if you live and work for most of your life in foreign place, it is a must to know their language and spelling.

The problem I have with this assertion is the following: From a strictly Greek perspective, it was better to declare bankruptcy in the beginning of the crisis. If we did that, by now things would have probably started to look up. Instead, what we did was stall, take on more debt, which of course helped everyone else in Europe: the banks had time to get rid of toxic assets and recapitalise, the states had time to build a firewall around themselves. In return for this, the Greeks got a protracted crisis and much more debt than they would have otherwise. My point is, Greece is a small country, it can hardly do what it needs and wants for itself; if it doesn't take what others say into consideration, it's curtains. 

&gt; How do Greeks picture Greece in 50 years? What is being done to make that happen?

Honestly, I don't know. Some ""liberalisation"" of the labour market is slowly starting to take place but I'm doubtful as to how much that can help in the long run. Public assets are being sold for peanuts. Do you think that would help? It seems it would do the opposite to me. The political system is at its deathbed, but who knows what will replace it.

Ce n'est pas une pirouette intellectuelle, c'est un refus d'accepter que le communisme soit défini par ceux qui se sont servi de son attrait pour commettre les horreurs dont tu parles, plutôt que par ceux qui ont inventé le mot et le concept. Si tu bloques sur le mot ""communisme"" et c'est compréhensible, on peut en utiliser un autre.

C'est d'ailleurs ce que tentent de faire ceux qui se disent trotskistes. Ça se base sur une vision de Trotsky comme le leader d'une révolution populaire efficace bien que peu violente, espoir d'un véritable communisme ruiné par des opportunistes comme Staline qui avaient d'autres idées.

C'est une conception sans aucun doute un peu trop romantique, mais quoi qu'il en soit, si tu veux utiliser l'histoire pour prouver que le communisme mène nécessairement a des horreurs, il te faudra d'abord montrer que Staline ou Mao faisaient du communisme au sens ou l'entendaient Marx et Hegel, ou puisque tu critiques Mélenchon, au sens ou Mélenchon l'entend.

Si tu ne vois pas de différence entre ce que propose Mélenchon et ce qu'ont fait Mao ou Staline, tu ne cherches pas bien loin. Tu le confirmes en faisant de moi un ""pair"" de Mao et Staline sur la base de quelques mots. D'autant que je suis d'accord avec toi pour dire que le communisme est un idéal, et que les choses ne sont pas si simples. Ça ne veut pas dire pour autant qu'il faut tout rejeter en bloc, surtout en faisant des généralisations douteuses comme ""les rouges"", qui montrent que tu en es resté à la propagande de la guerre froide.

Il y en a beaucoup des idéaux, qui ne sont pas si simples à concilier avec notre nature. Ça ne veut pas dire pour autant qu'il faut les abandonner. Sinon, on revient à la loi de la jungle, et on essaye pas de construire une société. A l'inverse, je suis tout a fait d'accord qu'il faut être raisonnable et mesuré.

Puisqu'on parle de Mélenchon, je n'ai pas l'impression qu'il soit complètement fou et qu'il ait pris le manifeste du parti communiste pour en faire son programme.

Would you care to back it up with any data? Because personally,   I’ve heard otherwise.  What exactly is the Lithuanian complaint with the Lithuanian language education in Poland?

&gt;  Having seen quite a few Polish-speaking Lithuanians, whose families have been living here for at least three generations, not being able to speak Lithuanian fluently, I think this change is long overdue
 
I respect your personal experience but on the other hand I actually heard an opinion that younger generation is generally fluent in Lithuanian and may speak proper version of Lithuanian taught at school , free of any local dialects and slang, as opposed to their young Lithuanian counterparts.  I also remember reading somewhere that university enrollment of Polish minority in Lithuania is slightly better than that of the general population, which shows that young Polish Lithuanians  have no problems with their command of Lithuanian. 

&gt; The Polish minority's case is further devalued by their abuse of the Polish language, which, in practice for them, means a mix of Polish, Russian and Lithuanian that a native speaker of any one of the mentioned languages would fail to fully understand. Case in point: the protesters, which the article mentions, were protesting with sings written mostly in Russian. It is for reasons like these, that some of my acquaintances, who previously considered themselves a part of the Polish minority are now trying to distance themselves form it.

Traditionally Polish people inhabiting the eastern parts of what used to be the Commonwealth spoke with funny melodic accents and used local patois. I don’t see how this discredits or devalues their national identity and desire to educate themselves in Polish language.  As for the signs, I have seen videos on you tube where demonstrators had sings in Polish, Lithuanian,  English and Russian.  Has it ever occurred to you that these signs are a way of attracting attention to their cause from non  Polish speakers and not a proof of the demonstrators incompetence in Polish language?

&gt;It doesn't help, that some municipality in a mostly Polish speaking region of Lithuania issued a statement, saying that it recognizes it's responsibility to Jesus above participation in the nation's government structure, which would be a despicable statement regardless of the ethnicity of the official responsible. Actually, it's no wonder that it was a Polish official, considering the average religiosity among Poles. As much as I'd like for the Poles to have a healthy community involved in our state affairs, I fear it's impossible because of such statements, made by their supposed representatives.

Absurd and ridiculus as this Jesus thing may be, it looks like an isolated incident and I fail to see how it is related to much larger issues of national minority group rights observance. You seem to be suggesting that entire Polish minority is made up of religious fanatics who cannot be trusted with local self government.  This is simply not true.

Depends on median income.

If you don't happen to be homeless and refuse to cash in your dole check it should be neigh impossible to live in absolute poverty in Europe... at least as citizen or legal alien.


[Relative poverty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_threshold#Relative_poverty) is defined to be 60% of median income.

1. Always say ""Prost"" when drinking with someone. If you don't, the punishment is horrible...

2. In almost all but high class restaurants, no one will seat you, you have to seat yourself. Also, the waiter will not check on you constantly. And softdrinks aren't refilled endlessly for free.

3. Good luck figuring out when to use ""Sie"" and when to use ""Du"". You will not succeed.

4. Other than that, I don't know. I assume you'll be travelling with your parents a alot? A few things that you otherwise wouldn't be allowed at your age will be legal if your parents are there, like seeing rated movies, or staying out late.

I agree with you that my information on the euro-crisis is one-sided because my biggest source of information is German media. I’m always willing to change my view if I can be convinced to do so by reasonable arguments. But I also think that my reproaches are based on solid facts.

&gt;The war here is not between Greeks and Germans, it's between the European middle-class and the banking sector.

I did never speak of a war.  That is what the Greek media is talking about. However I completely agree with you that the banking sector is to blame for many aspects of the euro-crisis.

&gt;Your comment is mildly racist at times, even if that wasn't your intention or even if you think that your racism has any empirical validity.

I certainly didn’t mean to sound racist. I’m sorry if that offended you. 

&gt;Contrary to popular belief, Greece did not lie to adopt the Euro. With the accounting techniques used when Greece was introduced to the Euro, Greece's deficit was less than 3%. Check the Wikipedia page ""Economy of Greece"" for more details.

In this case I have to admit that I was wrong. I checked the Wikipedia page and the corresponding sources and now I understand the situation better.

However, while reading about this I also read this:

&gt;In early 2010, it was revealed that successive Greek governments had been found to have consistently and deliberately misreported the country's official economic statistics to keep within the monetary union guidelines.  This had enabled Greek governments to spend beyond their means, while hiding the actual deficit from the EU overseers.

(source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Greece#2010.E2.80.93present_government_debt_crisis))

While this may have not been completely illegal it’s certainly immoral and could be called corrupt. Which brings me to your next point:

&gt;The Greek government, no matter how corrupt and terrible it may be, did not cause the crisis. How do I know that? Because I asked myself the obvious: if Greece is paying the consequences for its terrible government (or lazy citizens), then why is Italy, Spain, Ireland, and Portugal suffering a crisis as well? They can't be all that lazy and fiscally irresponsible. It can't be that only Germany has hard-working citizens.

* Italy had a terrible government for years! You can’t tell me that Berlusconi did a good job as prime minister. But (and this is what I’m missing in Greece) they accepted that they were in trouble and did something against that (technical government under Mario Monti).

* Ireland’s crisis was caused by a property bubble the reliance on foreign investments and inadequate control of the banking system.

* In Spain the factor that one third of the GDP relies on the real estate-sector caused problems after the housing-bubble burst.

* I unfortunately don’t know anything about why Portugal was hit by the finance crisis in this dimension.

The problem in Greece certainly is the amount of corruption and shadow economy (25% of the GDP)

&gt;Greece has the EU's second worst Corruption Perceptions Index after Bulgaria, ranking 80th in the world, and lowest Index of Economic Freedom and Global Competitiveness Index, ranking 119th and 90th respectively. Corruption, together with the associated issue of poor standards of tax collection, is widely regarded as both a key cause of the current troubles in the economy and a key hurdle in terms of overcoming the country's debt problem.

(source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Greece#Strengths_and_weaknesses))

&gt;The truth is that the Euro itself was established so that Germany can get rich while the southern countries get poorer.

This isn’t the truth. Germany wanted to keep their *Deutsche Mark*, but one of the conditions for the reunification was the extension of the European economic and monetary union (that is: the Euro). This is a prejudice that many people have but it’s just not true. Financial stability was always one of the most important pillars of German economy and the *Deutsche Mark* was very stable. I don’t negate the fact that our exports profited from the Euro but please know that this wasn’t a plan German politicians and people made (many of them still want the *Mark* back). This was a plan from French president Mitterande.

&gt;Germany is more competitive than Greece.

And why is that? It can’t be because of the amount of work the average worker does. We already made that clear. I think that the financial and economic regulations made by the German government and the measures against corruption are responsible for this difference in competitiveness in a large part. (But that’s only my opinion. Please prove me wrong if this is not right from your point of view.)

&gt;To add to that, German companies are loaning irresponsibly to Greece in order for Greeks to buy their products (this is called a vendor financing scheme). So capital flows from Greece to Germany uncontrollably and Germany develops a trade surplus.

So if you get offered something that is bad for you on a long term you still take it because it gives you pleasure on a short term? Greece didn’t have to accept that money but because the Greeks wanted a higher living standard (I can’t blame you for that) it was accepted. To live beyond one’s means is the keyword.

&gt;Germany is not helping Greece. Germany is helping the European banks. The bailout money will not go to the Greek people, it will go towards paying back the debt.

But why does Greece have to pay money to banks? Because the government spend more money than it had. Greece has lived beyond its means for years. And to make sure that this doesn’t happen again there has to be austerity.

&gt;Germany got most of its debts forgiven after the WWII. The US Marshall Plan gave Germany enough money so that its economy could stand on its feet. Think about this: nations were so generous to Germany despite all the atrocities that Germany committed in the WWII. And yet you feel that Greece, which hasn't done anything remotely as bad, doesn't deserve to be saved.

I never said, that I don’t think Greece deserves to be saved. Quite the contrary: I support the financial help given to your country because I thinks it's necessary to save the Euro and because I wish for a Europe where every country has economic strength. I just wish for more cooperation from the Greek side.

Also you just used a Nazi-analogy which you said before was something you wouldn’t do.

My points are:

* Corruption

* Shadow economy

* Living beyond one’s means for years (maybe even decades)",0,1331653702,null,0,false,0,c40kov1,t3_qqcm0,t1_c40kov1,t1_c40go7n,null,1435731911,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
true,Topf,RUSS,Russia,"Well I would argue on two points:

1. The expansion of the US might (economic, political, social) grew from a half decimated colony after the revolutionary war to one of two superpowers in the world after WWII. I see your point, that currently they are not able to perform the basic duties of a democracy, but I feel that is not necessarily due to the fact that it is a federalized body. In the technology age where direct democracy can be carried out quite efficiently with telephones, Internet, etc., the American gov't doesn't have many excuses as to why they are becoming so inefficient. It seems to me that corruption/ weak or corrupted leaders is the root of all evil (although that's a really general thing to say). Thus, this system has worked in the past, and I would say that we could make it work for Europe too.

2. Deprived of our colonial acquisitions, our economies have shrunk considerably. Without a picture this will be difficult to explain, so I will resort to a mathematical example. Let's say the economies of Europe in 1500 are represented by the arbitrary monetary sum of 100. With colonial expansion, we could increase our economies, improve infrastructure, technology, education. We enter the Renaissance, later Enlightenment. 

Our economies go up to 150, but with our colonies we have 200. In 1910 (before the shit hit the fan and we destroyed ourselves) we reached, let's say 250 for our internal economies and 300 for external. After the war we dropped to 180 for internal economic wealth, and over time our colonies disappeared. Now combining our countries we can reobtain somewhat the pre war levels, and hopefully unite our resources to expand once more. 

That's my logic- I could be completely wrong and/or crazy. I haven't actually told anyone my theory on federalization yet, so I'm interested to hear your response! At heart I'm a scientist, and my true hope for Europe is to begin colonizing space, so we can leave our worldly problems behind.

Sadly, I have no citations for that. I have no complaints about Lithuanian schools in Poland, though and think that residents should study in the state language, Lithuanian or not.

&gt;I also remember reading somewhere that university enrollment of Polish minority in Lithuania is slightly better than that of the general population, which shows that young Polish Lithuanians have no problems with their command of Lithuanian. 

I could request a citation for that, but who cares. Even if it's true, Polish minority occupies mainly well-off regions of Lithuania and a lot of university programs do not require a good command of the state language to enroll, which, I think, makes a point *against* minorities being discriminated in Lithuania. It sometimes gets ridiculous, though: a student in my class once complained of his low grade in state language courses and requested more lenient grading for him just because he was ethnically Russian (not first generation immigrant).

&gt;Traditionally Polish people inhabiting the eastern parts of what used to be the Commonwealth spoke with funny melodic accents and used local patois. I don’t see how this discredits or devalues their national identity and desire to educate themselves in Polish language. 

That would be true if it was just the dialect. Their protest signs were written in Cyrillic, when they were protesting against the reduction of classes taught in Polish. I fail to see how that isn't ironic in the context of them speaking a mix of Russian, Lithuanian and Polish day-to-day.

&gt;Has it ever occurred to you that these signs are a way of attracting attention to their cause from non Polish speakers and not a proof of the demonstrators incompetence in Polish language?

That wasn't their intention. Of course, you are free to disagree, but I have met only one person who belonged to the Polish minority and could fluently read scientific literature written in Polish, which makes him about 10% of my sample.

&gt;it looks like an isolated incident and I fail to see how it is related to much larger issues of national minority group rights observance.

Except it wasn't an isolated incident, and another municipality issued the same statement as a sign of solidarity, I suppose. Check out the references I provided elsewhere in the thread.

&gt;But (and this is what I’m missing in Greece) they accepted that they were in trouble and did something against that (technical government under Mario Monti). […] I support the financial help given to your country because I thinks it's necessary to save the Euro and because I wish for a Europe where every country has economic strength. I just wish for more cooperation from the Greek side.

Actually Greece has a technocrat prime minister installed by the ECB as well. His name is Lucas Papademos. It's funny that you think it's a good thing though. If you believe that the German government and the ECB are trying to save us, then maybe it is (actually even then it isn't because he wasn't elected democratically). But I'm inclined to think otherwise. The austerity measures have not been working and have sent us to a negative growth spiral from which it'll take us years to recover. On the other hand, the banking sector is receiving the bailout money (the term 'bailout' is misleading: first of all it's a loan, so we'll have to pay back, second of all it doesn't go to us, it goes back to the banks - and we had to make cuts on healthcare and education, among other things, to get it). So it's clear to me that Papademos was installed just so measures that are clearly harmful to the people (and everyone has pointed this out by now, [even IMF officials](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/feb/01/imf-austerity-harming-greeve)) but are beneficial for the ECB &amp; and the banks can keep being passed. 

In any case, your government or the ECB should *not* have the right to force Greece to lose some of its independence (and modify its constitution in order to make that possible) no matter how much the Greek government has wronged. Our current prime minister was not elected, so our current regime resembles more a dictatorship than a democracy. As if that wasn't enough, Wolfgang Schaube [has asked Greece not to proceed with elections](http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/319769), and continue with a technocrat government that ""would not include Greek politicians."" And you're asking why Greek people are not cooperating? Maybe because they've lost control over their country?

&gt;Germany wanted to keep their Deutsche Mark, but one of the conditions for the reunification was the extension of the European economic and monetary union (that is: the Euro). […] I don’t negate the fact that our exports profited from the Euro but please know that this wasn’t a plan German politicians and people made (many of them still want the Markback).

That doesn't make sense. You describe it as if Germany absolutely had to go by the conditions for reunification, and had no role in actually setting them. I'm sorry, but this ""France wanted to profit but Germany didn't"" story sounds bull to me. I'm sure a lot of politicians were against the EMU, there's always a portion of politicians that in every country that are against the EU. But when you look at charts like [this one](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/01/30/opinion/013012krugman3/013012krugman3-blog480.jpg) which show the capital flow from southern countries to Germany very clearly, I find it very hard to believe that Germany did not anticipate *any* of this uncontrollable export-driven growth (again, uncontrollable because it gives the other countries no ability to fix their currencies), which could only lead to the southern countries going through a recession.

&gt;We already made that clear. I think that the financial and economic regulations made by the German government and the measures against corruption are responsible for this difference in competitiveness in a large part. (But that’s only my opinion. Please prove me wrong if this is not right from your point of view.)

I'm not disputing any of that. Though the Euro did a lot to perpetuate the differences in competitiveness, it's clear that Germany is more competitive than Greece and that we're a bureaucratic mess. Some countries are more competitive than others. No question about it. But this difference in competitiveness doesn't have to necessarily lead to a huge capital flow from one country to the other. There are mechanisms to prevent that (trade restrictions, devaluation of currency) but in a shared currency you can't have any of them. In fact Robert Mundell, who did the initial work on optimum currency areas on which the Euro was based, had the following as a requirement for a functioning shared currency (taking this from the Wikipedia page for optimum currency areas): 

&gt;A risk sharing system such as an automatic fiscal transfer mechanism to redistribute money to areas/sectors which have been adversely affected by the first two characteristics

Note that it's a *fiscal transfer*, not a loan at interest coupled with austerity. So the only way to have a functioning shared currency system is to actually provide aid to countries that can't catch up since the shared currency makes it very easy for money to fly from one country to the other. This is what happens between US states, which can all share the dollar because the federal government can send money from one state to the other with minimal political friction. But between European countries that doesn't work. It would be a very unpopular decision if your government suddenly said that they're not just going to give out loans to Greece but actually send them money. And don't trust my words for all this, here's a quote from a recent article in the Telegraph:

&gt;If you think, as I do, that Greece did indeed commit a host of sins but is also the first of several victims of a mad ideological experiment that shackled together economies with different growth rates, wage bargaining systems, productivity patterns, sensitivity to interest rates, and inflation proclivities - without **fiscal transfers** or sufficient labour mobility to cushion the effects - and that this disaster was compounded by Germany’s (beggar-thy-EMU-neighbour?) wage squeeze, and compounded yet further by **sharp monetary and fiscal contraction at the wrong moment** in the states most at risk, then you will expect the crisis to grind on whatever happens in Greece.

Moving on:
&gt;So if you get offered something that is bad for you on a long term you still take it because it gives you pleasure on a short term? Greece didn’t have to accept that money but because the Greeks wanted a higher living standard (I can’t blame you for that) it was accepted. To live beyond one’s means is the keyword.

The government took those loans, not the people. Plus the people didn't live ""beyond their means"" as much as you're portraying them to. We experienced massive inflation when the Euro was introduced. And also we're not as huge spenders as we are shown to be. Our household debt is quite low (40%) compared to most European countries (mind you, household debt is a different thing than sovereign debt). The loans were not accepted because ""we"" wanted a higher living standard. We weren't the ones to accept the loans. The government did.  Greek politicians were bribed by German (and other counties') companies into making deals that had nothing to do with bringing up the Greek living standard  and more to do with them profiting ([submarine scandal](http://www.athensnews.gr/issue/13431/37986), [Siemens scandal](http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2011/01/25/siemens-scandal-cost-greek-taxpayers-2/)).

In any case, you have a naive view on the concept of debt, specifically the idea that a loan *must* necessarily be paid back. This idea was used by the IMF to cut free healthcare and education programs from Third World countries in the 80s in the name of ""austerity."" People literally died in order for banks to cut losses. Even if the people who pay for the debt weren't the ones who asked for the loans in the first place. Does that sound right to you?

For a detailed investigation on how debt has been used throughout the human history to justify profiteering and perpetuate inequalities, check out David Graeber's Debt: The First 5000 Years. 

&gt;Also you just used a Nazi-analogy which you said before was something you wouldn’t do.

I clearly did not. I was just exposing the double standard on what constitutes ""fair help"" between countries. I said that Germany received abundant fiscal aid no matter its past behavior, but the possibility of Greece receiving fiscal aid has been framed by the media everywhere as outlandish.

Of course it should be noted that in Sweden and in many other European countries there are only public universities and they all have to confine to some standards on their quality of teaching.

He lost the Google argument because he vetted who went on the site and what links could be posted.

From the judges ruling:

At para 48 HHJ Ticehurst found “no recordings were actually stored on the defendant’s website” and that, adopting Tamberlin, J’s words “it is the remote websites which make available the sound recordings”, hence his Honour’s upholding of the “mere conduit” defence. Mr Jones stopped short – perhaps only just – of arguing Rock &amp; Overton is wrongly decided although he submits it is overly restrictive. Instead he contends S.107 (2A) is properly reflective of Richard O’Dwyer’s conduct which can be distinguished from Rock &amp; Overton. **Firstly both TVShack websites were entirely in the hands of Richard O’Dwyer and his co conspirators requiring third parties to sign up to TVShack and be vetted before going further. Secondly he argues, unlike Rock &amp; Overton, there was no attempt to protect copyright, he, Richard O’Dwyer, knew materials were subject to copyright and actively taunted already cited efforts in June 2010 to seize TVShack.net.**

Accordingly Mr Jones argues (@ para 15 of his written submissions of 31st October 2011) **“O’Dwyer would not be able to avail himself of the “mere conduit” defence enumerated in Regulation 17 because he was intimately involved in deciding who was allowed to post links on the TVShack websites, which links would be posted…”** (etc) &amp; ( para 16 continues) “… a plain reading of the phrase “make available” in this context makes clear O’Dwyer “made available copyrighted material”. ** HHJ Ticehurst (@ para 71) in Rock &amp; Overton held “make available should bear its ordinary and natural meaning”. He distinguished between providing money “directly to” another as opposed to a financial adviser who may “point” another to a bank meaning the bank alone “makes available the money”.
