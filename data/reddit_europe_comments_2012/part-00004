And if it's anything like Quebec, the math is fuzzy and the statistics dishonestly interpreted.

In Canada, the argument against Quebec leaving is ""welfare state would fail, eleventy billion dollars of aid"" etc.

The actual aid comes down to about $1200 per person in Quebec. Meaning Ottawa sends back $1200 per resident of the province.

Of course what's left out of that is all of the federal taxes people in Quebec pay to Ottawa. Which is pretty close to what they get back, at least as a whole. Then, you factor in provincial taxes, which are quite high. Why? Because Quebec runs many institutions in parallel to the federal gov't or on their own and you have a situation where there's duplication.

If you're applying for a job in a bank or something with a better salary, you should get a nice shirt, go to a photographer etc. You could use photo booths if it's an insignificant job. But don't use biometric passport photos for it. Google pictures for ""bewerbungsfotos"", it will give you a good impression.

In the south (deep south especially), people there are regressive thinkers. Because power is centralised in DC, no one is accountable to them.

I, and many other ""small government"" folks are of the opinion that strong federalism isn't what is keeping progressive thought alive in the south, it's what's allowing regressive thought to flourish. It gives them a target. One that isn't accountable to them.

Classic argument: without federal intervention, slavery would not have ceased.

Current argument: Arab Spring

Do you see where I'm headed with this?

The south is *more* regressive because of northern liberals/progressives imposing federalism on them. Since the time of the Civil War. Had things had a chance to run their natural course and play out, I think you'd see a different south. Especially because slaves and their sympathisers would have had to work it out amongst themselves against pro-slave owners. It would have given the former dignity and knocked the latter down a few pegs.

To me, your argument makes as much sense as US imperialism at the end of a gun. Liberate Iraq, change their institutions and be welcomed as liberators and whatnot. You can't rely on external pressures.

It seems blatantly misinformed to present the issues of the Euro as issues that Germany (or, as you put it, ""Germans"") has somehow imposed on the rest of the EU.

Tough deal, but what are you going to do? Forcibly prevent other, sovereign countries from cooperating?

Quit antagonizing Germany. It's useless, wrong, and counterproductive.

Even micro fluctuations balance out, ripples make for speculation-candy drawing investment, and the chance of a quick automated buck makes for the market equivalent of the best card game in town.  If the odds are less in their favour because the pit bosses take a cut gamblers will go elsewhere. The same can be said for the Tobin tax and speculators.

I honestly think the UK approach of introducing banking levies on debt and increasing maximum reserve holdings as a more responsible approach without ruining the prospects of 'a flutter' - in terms of the card game analogy it's more like making sure that any players have the stake to back up their bets and making it more difficult to wager the entire barn.  That banks are allowed to take risks on the condition that they have what it takes to cover their bets on their own if it doesn't pay off.  Europe wouldn't even be having this conversation had that mechanism already been in place before the banks needed bailing out.

Sure, I'm no fan of the speculative derivative paradigm we're in but by expecting to tax it more isn't going to get rid of it, only move it elsewhere, and in a globalised market that's only going to buy Europe abstract security and nothing tangible.  There's no point throwing the fruit machines and one arm bandits out of what is already a gambling den for being slutty, and keeping the roulette table.  For better or for worse derivative speculation is here to stay - punishing it isn't going to stop it, it's just going to make Europe less attractive to the international finance scene.  As long as it's regulated, and if that's what the industry wants to speculate on, let them have at it.

Milan - I don't know. We were mostly in the city. There just wasn't anything there that excited me. I'm not really into fashion and expensive labels, by that stage of the trip I'd seen enough cathedrals and old buildings to be getting a bit bored with that, the University we visited was.... well lets just say we were meant to spend 2 full days at Uni, ended up leaving after the first morning and using the time as extra time to tour around because our Professor had been offered a bribe to do some things that kind of go against academic ethics so we staged a walk out.... the food we ate was overpriced and pretty terrible... there were lots of beggars harrassing us (and this from someone living in a 3rd world country...) maybe we just didn't go to the right spots, but our leader had been there multiple times before and seemed to get it right in all the other cities we visited. Maybe Italy just isn't for me. I didn't enjoy Venice that much either, and others rave about it (again, overpriced, bad service, very average food, the whole place was filthy and it stank like rot and sweat).

Even if you're Chinese and don't understand one word German and never watch any German TV, you'll have to pay if you have a radio/TV/PC in Germany. That is why so many people say it's a tax, even though it isn't. And if you have no receivers, you actually also don't have to pay. But this will change in 2013. Then everyone pays.

The point is that the laws are quite clear to a certain extend. The device is in your house but the GEZ-people have no right to enter your home. They could theoretically go to court and get a search warrant. But this never happens, because the privacy of your home has higher value than the GEZ's interest to get your money. And because they can't see into your apartment, they also don't know what's in it. They have no leverage.

With the Abmahnungen the other lawyers could always go to court and there is a high possibility they win if you do nothing. And normally they have already some evidence that you downloaded something.

I guess a lawyer would tell you that these two are very different issues.

And the fees are monthly. It's 6€ for radio/PC and 18€ for. TV includes radio and PC, and it doesn't matter how many you have at home, unless you run a business.

I and a lot of other people think that is way to much. They get around 7.5 billion € each year. According to the law this should be used to provide basic broadcasting services for Germans. If I researched correctly, in the UK they have a similar system. They pay a bit less and they collect just over 4 billion € a year. Because it is broadcast, it doesn't matter that much if you broadcast to 60 or 80 million people. 

And the quality of some of the program in the UK is great. Their documentation are famous, also here in Germany. Of course, they also produce crap. But on public German TV stations there is so much crap. The news are good, but most in-house productions are awful and they are very conservative. Internet, video games, and practically everything the youth is doing is evil. But my main point is that they don't provide basic services. Instead they try to cover everything. You might assume that maybe 2-3 TV stations plus a couple radio station are enough to provide basic services. Today there are maybe about 20, analog+digital, TV station.

A great worry for Germany is that, and I googled this just now to get a better look at the problem. It appears to be a very serious problem for Germany if anything disrupts Greece.

Also pedophiles don't suffer from any physical or mental weakness over any other person, so they can work just as fine or just as lousy as anyone else.

If I were you - with that limited time you have -  my first preference would be to travel Bavaria, because you said you are keen on seeing castles and such. Since you are flying out from Frankfurt I would advise you to stay in the south. Like others have said you would spend most of your time in trains. Oh yeah and don't buy first class tickets. Not worth it, 2nd class is just as nice.

I myself am from Cologne but even though the Cologne Cathedral is the most popular tourist sight in Germany, spending more than an hour in Cologne is just not worth it. So don't feel like you are missing out on something, when people are telling you it's a must see. If you happen to find a train connection that goes through Cologne and has a couple hours of a stop over there, then take it. The Dom (Cathedral) is just outside of the central station. You can stare at it for an hour and then move on. :)

Hope I could be of any help. Have a great stay here and in Europe in general.

The bailout was IMF driven and conditional on Ireland converting bank debt to sovereign debt . This included both secured and unsecured debt. 

The issue at the time was that if the Irish Banks defaulted then contagion would spread throughout the eurozone to the other PIIGS ( Portugal, Ireland , Italy, Greece , Spain) . In turn that would make the Euro unstable. 

Ireland as a small open economy is in a very different position to a larger economy.

And sorry, but to claim German and Czech beer is ""more about volume"" makes you sound like an arrogant asshole. Yes, there are German/Czech mass-volume beers, just as there are in Belgium (personally I take a Beck's or Budweiser over a Stella any time). But there are also countless small to mid-sized breweries, each producing their style of beer. In Frankonia pretty much each bigger village has its own brewery, most of them centuries old. People are often fiercely loyal to ""their"" beer, there are festivals celebrating it, huge rivalries about different styles of beer (for example Alt in Duisburg against Kölsch in Cologne). If that is not culture then I don't know what is. 

Yes, the differences will be more nuanced and subtle then what some Belgian brewers produce. We also have no beer sommeliers, which you seem to find essential. But personally, for MY taste, I - as most Germans - don't even like most Belgian beers.

* **tío/tía** - dude/guy. Used in exactly the same way. Can either be used as an interjection *(Tio, te digo...)* or to refer to a specific person *(Conozco un tío...)*. 
* **hombre!** - Used as an interjection indicating surprise or to emphasize a statement. *(Hombre, no!)*
* **coño!** - like hombre, another interjection used at the start of the sentence to indicate surprise. 
* **""avolear tongue click""** - It's very common in Spain to click your tongue before saying something that has an emotional tint to it. If you listen for it, you'll notice it a lot. This is used up to once a minute depending on the person. 
* **guay** - cool
* **molar** - verb, meaning ""to rock"" or to be cool. *(Eso mola!)*
* **chungo/a** - adjective for something that is bad
* **cutre** - in the same vein as chungo, but more like ""sketchy, shabby, a dive"". You'd say this about a run-down bar.
* **que bien** - ""How cool!"" Never say que bueno, that's South American spanish.
* **vale** - ""OK"". Used at least once in every sentence. 
* **venga** - another interjection, usually used when you're leaving a conversation or saying goodbye to someone. Doesn't mean anything. 
* **venga va!** - ""Come on! Let's go!""

it seems that the UK's net national disposable income is c. 75% of Germany's already, so that suggests things are about equal the UK's population of c. 60 million being c. 75% of Germany's 80 million.

Then consider that the UK actually has a legal claim under international convention for between 25-50% of the North Sea oil fields.  25% according to coastline borders, up to 50% according to geological seabed surveys.  Settlement is not likely to be anyway near that, but it won't be nothing either. 

Then consider in September 2011 the UK struck gas/oil for the second time, the first being in the English bays of the Irish Sea.  The second hit was a bit further away and promises, according to geological study, to be of considerable significance and resource; the Falklands.  After successfully discovering the predicted field full mining operations are due to be underway by 2014 - when the Scottish referendum is to take place.  Whereas England has some lesser claim to the North Sea oil fields Scotland in declaring independence from the UK would have no claim on the as of yet untapped Falklands.  Effectively England, Wales and Northern Ireland will have that, some of the North Sea, and all of the UK Irish Sea fields to themselves, whereas otherwise they would have been split 4 ways.  

Add to that nearly all the refinery capacity of the current UK is in England or Wales.

So to answer your question; neither.  It's not foolhardy, nor is it driven by loss of oil revenue because it will go towards paying what the UK currently pays for anyway, and in all likelihood split three ways; debt, NHS, offsetting corporation tax for the banks which the SNP has promised - the big two Scottish banks being owned with controlling shares by UKIF i.e. the English, Welsh and Northern Irish taxpayer.

Scotland will reapply and ascension will literally be a case of going through the motions - a veritable case of taking a plane from Edinburgh to Brussels and signing a piece of paper, maybe a photographer with numerous handshakes, a smorgasbord of gallic kisses and abundant back slapping.

Scotland will walk into the EU on the day of independence; it serves noone that they won't and it surely will qualify above and beyond many other already member nations. Their contribution will be leveled in advance; if the referendum passes these things will be addressed with plenty of time spared.

Ok, sue Hungary over its unorthodox policies. But then sue Austria too. They corrupted Hungarian politicians in the past, who then changed the laws which allowed the Austrian banks to sell swiss franc and euro loans on 3-4 times bigger rates than elsewhere. You see, if the loans were for lesser rates, people could have paid them back, and if the forint interest rate was not kept that high, then frank and euro loans would have not pushed out forint loans either.

I think it means precisely what it does mean.  The Euro has been a disaster for virtually everybody concerned, especially in Southern Europe.  The current crisis we are seeing now is just the tip of the iceberg.  Spain, Italy and Greece have been slowly losing competitiveness against Germany precisely because they are in the currency union.

&gt; It has not been a disaster throughout its lifetime it is currently struggling, but no different to many other currencies have experienced in their lifetime.

Completely wrong.  The Euro has been a disaster for manufacturers in Southern Europe.  The Euro will impoverish more Europeans than anything since the Second World War.

Your claim that the Euro is no different from any other currency is laughable.  The Euro is 13 years old and already on its knees.  It is fundamentally flawed as a concept.  You simply cannot tie the likes of Germany and Greece together into a single currency.  Their economic needs are completely different.

&gt; The pound had a terrible time when the UK left the ERM but it bounced back, other currencies have experienced similar issues but with the euro because it is a new currency and also a new experiment in a unified currency so it seems to be more open to attack.

I do not wish the currency of the country I call home to be an ""experiment"".  Currencies are not and should not be labelled ""experiments"".  They're vital economic tools that should be as stable as possible.  The very fact that you label the Euro as an ""experiment"" damns the project as a complete failure.

Further, the irony of you mentioning the ERM, another currency union that failed spectacularly, in the context of trying to convince me that the Euro is anything other than a terrible mistake is mindblowing.

This will give you a chance to check out Europe and then when you have made a decision where to settle time for you to get yourself established and for the kids to learn the language. Alternatively do it in a 2 stage process - Britain to start , Continent next .

Be careful where you land yourself - choose your country wisely - do plenty of research and ask around . Check the local laws , the economic and cultural situations .

In my opinion :-

countries that are ok. - Britain , France , Ireland , Scandinavia , Germany , Austria , Switzerland , The Netherlands .

countries to be careful with or avoid :- Spain ( check thoroughly ) , Portugal ( check thoroughly ) , Belgium ( no - Vlaams etc. on the war path + too much bureaucracy ) , Greece - definitely not - a war zone almost . Be very careful with Eastern Europe - some good , some not .

Italy - a great place on the surface but a lot going on - check thoroughly .

Journalist are not destroyed financially trough legal attacks, and are not fined for using minority language like in the bordering Slovakia, and journalists are not beaten up and assassinated like in Serbia. Hungary (even after the controversial law) qualifies as a country with free press. If you read all the serious criticism (and not the attention-seeking blogs or the reports with factual errors), all controversy around the media law comes down to this: the media authority is a single institution, while previously and in other countries the tasks of the media authority are done by multiple organizations. (Just a note, even the freedomhouse.org article on Hungary contains errors. )

There were no ""actions against"", your wording is suggesting a biased preconception. The working of courts was historically very sluggish, the new laws and the reforms are aimed at guaranteeing their faster operation. The courts are undergoing a reform, and old judges don't cope well with reforms. 

If you are looking for signs of the government meddling into neutrality of courts, you should look at individual cases. That is how pressure on courts works, if there is pressure. There were instances during the previous government, when someone ""phoned a friend"" to influence the prosecution to have an ease on someone. But the socialists had a number of scandals attacking the judiciary and the prosecutors. Did you know that Hungary did not have a chief prosecutor for a year because that was more suiting to the socialists? There were, and still are multiple open cases of corruption done by socialist politicians. The prosecution is not attacking the socialists on a political basis, they are prosecuting the corruption cases. This goes back for years. You are wrong if you think that the socialists are trying to protect democratic principles, they are trying to avoid (or delay as long and by any means available) the prosecution of their corruption cases. When they were in power, they did that directly, now they have raised a hysteria and are hiding behind concerns over democracy.

Note that this is the same with Ing-Diba and DKB. Though DKB has this for Germany as well. I know someone has DKB and they have something like a daily, a weekly and a monthly withdrawl limit on the credit card (the one you can use for free on the atm). It was something like €500 a week. If you buy anything big with cash, you hit it pretty fast. That's why I mentioned the limit. With comdirect you have lesser options concerning the free atms, but you withdraw money with the EC, which means you withdraw directly form the account. The limits are much higher AFAIK.

I don't know why you are interested in annual interest. Currently interest levels are below inflation. Personally I would distrust any bank that has high interest levels. Another crash is coming anyways. Last time the banks with the high interest on their ""Girokonto"" where wiped out (Iceland banks) or barely survived with huge state subsidies (Bank of Scotland) and the lattter is already back promising huge interest if you give them your money. 

Interest from any reputable bank shouldn't be much higher than the European central bank interest rate of currently 1%, which is way below inflation. Keeping cash in Euro is greatly discouraged for this reason and also because of the impending doom, which could wipe out the value of money or simply the bank you put it in. You either need to buy stocks, bonds, property or whatever. Just don't keep large amounts of cash. And what is the annual return of €50.000 at 1% interest rate: €500. Actually if we are talking about anything above €20.000 I would walk into a Volksbank/Raiffeisenbank (collective banking), because those have the highest chance of not crashing with the next crash. Comdirect has a pretty high chance. DKB is a state owned bank, so they are pretty secure as well. Also the Sparkasse. But if I ever had more money than €20.000 I would put it in an account at a Volksbank. They have free EC accounts as well and for that kind of money they are 100% willing to give you good conditions.

Btw. it used to be that you had to pay a lot for banking services in Germany. In the US they still charge you through the nose for banking services. I think most US citizen pay their banks up to 2% to handle their money. That's some annual interest rate, ain't it?",0,1326538761,null,0,false,0,c3h39g3,t3_og2n5,t1_c3h39g3,t1_c3gyyct,null,1428178223,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

It was foisted on them by some French dudes who were chasing a chimera.

They always knew it would end in disaster.

Since that was the case they decided to just organise things for their own maximum benefit and let the dudes in the South look to themselves as best they could.

The Germans decided to make as much money as possible for as long as possible and when it all comes crashing down amid tears and recrimination, take out the cheque book and write the smallest cheque possible to cover German expenses in this thing and direct the recrimination at lazy Southerners and the Anglo-Saxon spivs of international finance.

Lets see:

- Leroy Merlin: one of the best places to buy shit like that. I don't know if it's expensive or not, but it has tons of BBQs, outside tables and chairs, lamps... Everything you may need for picnic/camping/whatever.

- Carrefour/Alcampo/Hipercor: standard shopping places. They have everything (mostly food, but also clothes, gear, toys, books, etc.). Average quality, low prices. They'll have one here for sure.

- LIDL: a ¿german? shop. Famous mostly for its chocolates, but from time to time they sell random stuff (I bought a quite good telescope there for a really good price). So, chances are they won't have a BBQ, but if they do, it will be good quality (or, at least, better than average) *and* cheap.

- Media Markt: sells mostly electronic stuff, but also electric things (toasters, washing machines...). I'm quite sure the'll have one there. They are cheaper than average, but I for one don't like it. There has been a lot of problems, mainly because when you return something you bought and found out to be broken, they just put it back in the box and sell it again (also: people buying XBox 360's and finding bricks inside the box; people complaining the digital camera they just bought has a lot of pictures inside, etc.).

America has been very important for the world economy for many years, perhaps thats why their institutions have better fiscal policy. I never knew the ECB was only concerned with price control, what an awful system! That's a very small part of the economy.

So the Euro could be saved (I won't say if it should or shouldn't as that isn't really the issue) if the ECB was to undergo a fundamental change. I'd firstly say some heads need to roll, the sorts of yes-men who have caused this crisis need to be ousted. We then need somebody more flexible with monetary policy given a proper mandate to sort the currency union - I would say they need devaluation, all the nations that are in trouble look like they could be helped by devaluation and it's not like the German industry wouldn't be helped out greatly by that. Thirdly they then need to promote more than just price stability, they need more employment and interest rates that are fit for purpose. The very traditional economists of the ECB who support cutting costs and raising revenue need to be aware of the dire effects this will have on the stability of that block. When you're dealing with the currency of 17 countries directly and 10 indirectly, when you're dealing with fiscal policy of 500 million people, when 20% of the world's GDP is at stake, then you have to use untraditional methods because we are not living in the same simple economies that these traditional methods worked for.",0,1326553949,null,0,false,0,c3h478d,t3_obb6n,t1_c3h478d,t1_c3guga3,null,1435747805,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

In my opinion (at least that's what I hope), it is normally not meant to be taken literally. It's just that many southern Europeans live in countries where many Germans will pay a lot of money to go for holidays. It's that ""you live where I spend my vacations""-mentality that leads to such ""attitudes"".

Of course there are also many Germans who will live in the same small town and won't leave the country (other than going to Italy for holiday) most of their lives. In my experience, it's exactly these people who will have some strange attitudes towards anything/anyone not German...
