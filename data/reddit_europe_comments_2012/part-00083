I agree. I think the Euro project is inevitable and has the potential to be a really great force in the world, but I fear that it is being created due to economic necessity without a vision of what a strong centralized government will mean for ordinary Europeans. 

&gt; My idea of state is a political, bureaucratic and technical apparatus that make things work. We can have ideals, but an identity is useless. So, what shared ideals we need? The ideals behind ""Human rights"" are enough.

But a powerful central government does more than ""make things work."" It makes decisions based on values. It decides how to allocate resources, chooses who gets government stimulus/bailouts and who goes bankrupt, and how to align in geopolitical conflicts. These are not right/wrong questions, but decisions based on collective will that will require sacrifices by some groups in favor of others. If people don't feel that they are part of a greater European entity, I wonder if they will be willing to submit to the collective decision even if those decisions are made democratically.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Look the welfare and tax cheaters may be a tiny minority in your country, but are you sure it is all over Europe?

My actual experience as a Hungarian: 

- in 10M people 800K being on disability i.e. 8% of the population is _obviously_  a sign of many people gaming the system. It was a semi-official method to hide rural unemployment, the government semi-officially allowed doctors loose rules for assigning disability (for a bribe of course) because that way unemployment numbers looked better. Unskilled, rural, 45 years old, nobody would employ you -&gt; disability. It was stopped, more or less, but this is only one kind of gaming the system, there are many others... *Tiny minority? Not if the government is an accomplice in the fraud in order to hide real unemployment numbers.* Yes I know it sounds very surprisingly, because you are used to very different ethical standards in politics. My suggestion is not to be too trusting before you check the actual situation... 

- The big problem is not welfare gaming but tax gaming. I would say here only the state employees and the employees of the multinational corporations don't cheat. Everybody else cheats, more or less, because if you pay your employees under the table, you can offer 10-15% cheaper prices and it means you automatically win the tenders of the government and the multinational corporations, because they tend to select only on price, usually by an automatic software (reverse auction, e-procurement), in order to avoid corruption. So you must cheat even if you are not greedy, or else you cannot do any business, as you will be too expensive for your customers. The difference is only that more ethical companies cheat less, i.e. try to keep the under the table payment fairly low. Less ethical companies report everybody as being on a minimum wage 6 hours a day, part-time, and everything else is under the table. And obviously the owner of small businesses is officially on minimum wage plus maybe 10% to look less suspicious. 

The typical method of tax cheating is: 

- Selling to friends without an invoice (without VAT) and using the undocumented income for under the table salary/wage payments, this is why Hungary or Italy has very strict rules of not having holes in invoice numbers or else people would just throw some invoices away.  Example: a bartender when only known people, friends (i.e. no possible tax office agents) are in the bar sell booze without a bill, and after closing time refills the whisky bottles in his van from whisky bottle purchased from the Chinese market that were smuggled and have no excise tax on them. (Probably smuggled by bribing customs.)

You can be fairly sure that countries that have rules about not having holes in invoice numbers and also invoice numbers must have strict date order have many such cases. Hungary and Italy have such rules, probably many others East and South.


- Buying ""fake"" purchase invoices.(""Fake"" in the sense of no real business transaction happening.) It means a company gives you an invoice of €10K+VAT for 5% or 10% of the total amount, this reduces your VAT liability and creates a fake cost you can use for under the table salary payments. Typically the company who sold the ""fake"" invoice is registered to the name of some homeless dude never to be found, and the real owner has some friends in the tax office who tell him when it is his turn to be checked, then he sells the company to somewhere like Tajikistan (seriously) and there the tracability stops.

- My favorite is the Chinese restaurants. They are so impertinent that it actually commands some respect. The bravado, the boldness, I mean. While the natives are fearful and are bending or breaking the rules only so far they dare, they have the courage simply not give any fucks about the rules. They rent a place, open a restaurant, and they absolutely do not register a company nor do any sort of official licence or paper nor pay any sort of tax nor give invoices. It takes the tax office at least 2 years to recognize their existence, they send the agents, but there is simply no employer, no company, no owner, so they just cannot fine anyone nor can they send anyone to prison. The guy who signed the rental contract is already in back home in Guangdong. So they cannot punish anyone, all they can do is to close down the place and  confiscate the cheap plastic chairs and plaster dragons which can be replaced from about 2 weeks of profits and then a week later they open another restaurant two  corners away.

This is how we roll. This is not just Hungary, I would say this is most of the post-commie East and probably much of the South. Italy, Greece certainly, Spain, Portugal probably, I am not 100% sure.

I can recommend a place near Paris, but far enough to really enjoy France nature. 
You have to take a train at Gare Saint Lazare, in direction of Rouen or Le Havre. 
Stop at Vernon (it's about 45 minutes of train travel). 

There you can rent bikes. You can reach the camping of Saint Marcel (see link above, obviously in french). Once there, you can chill out as much as you want in this nice place of Normandy - don't think omaha beach, though, it's more the rural part, with cows, forest, and the seine valley -. On the plus side, you can bike from there to the Giverny village and visit the house and garden of Claude Monet, where he painted most of his stuff. Highly recommended.

I haven't been at many German airports (just one actually) so I'm not really able to compare them except for their location. To me Hamburg sounds like a good idea if you can get a good flight there.

No, I really want to make this point clear: this is **not** just my euphemism for saying ""Southerners are lazy and corrupt"", but the most abstract way I know of saying: something that transcends individuals is in place and guides the behavior in a certain way. Sure, it does include what we usually call ""culture"", but that's just another abstract term, isn't it? 

The point is, I don't put the blame (or praise, if the institutions are good) for this culture on the people, or at least not on individual people. I'm a bit of a fatalist: I don't believe in individual, free actions and decisions that much. Let's say, for simplification, we're all just Turing machines. I don't think the individual Turing machine born in Sicily differs much from the TM born in Bavaria. But the former tends to grow up, with a statistically much higher risk of performing certain economically damaging actions (even though they are individually rational for him, and maybe even collectively rational for his group of friends, narrow family), while the latter is less likely to do so. 

So with that in mind, I'm wondering what is the *cause* of those differences in behavior (or likelihood of behavior).

](http://www.economist.com/node/21556930)

&gt;EUROPE teeters at the edge of an economic abyss, its fate in the hands of political leaders at odds over how to solve the continent’s twin debt and bank crises. America may be pushed over a “fiscal cliff” at the end of the year by political dysfunction. And even China, although unlikely to take a deep dive, is hostage to the will and ability of its government to stimulate growth. More than at any point in recent history, the global economy’s fate is tied to the capriciousness of policymakers. How much does such uncertainty cost?

&gt;Anecdotal evidence suggests that it costs a lot. Customers of Cisco Systems, the world’s biggest maker of internet gear, are taking longer to make decisions, according to John Chambers, the company’s boss. Their orders tend to be smaller than before, and to require more in-house approvals. They say they are planning to buy more stuff later this year, reported Mr Chambers recently, but “then in the very next breath they say it depends on what happens on a global and macro scale.”

But if the policy uncertainty now has been removed, the markets may be right that business will start investing again. But from what I understand, there's a real lack of demand because everybody is trying to pay down their debts at the same time.

I still want to stress this again though: I don't believe *individual* people simply *create* those institutions that encourage (non-cooperative) behavior out of bad will, or even out of a conscious decision. The whole questions how these institutions arise, how some countries are ""blessed"" with better institutions than others, really doesn't reduce, IMO, to a simple ""it's because those people *chose* to install them"". Please note, this is not some moral relativism, where I say ""oh, we're all just the same big happy family, and everyone is special in his own way."". No, institutions that encourage (or don't discourage) tax evasion are objectively worse, if your goal is efficiency and maximizing public wealth. The point is however that there are no industrious, righteous Germans that ""chose"" their institutions, or short-sighted Greeks that ""chose"" theirs. I assume that at birth, they're both the same. And then the institutions come into play and their paths diverge. Now {political, economical, social} science has to figure two things: a) what gave rise to the institutions in the first place? (local climate? agriculture?), and b) how can we influence, ""from the outside"", change in institutions that we rationally consider inefficient and harmful for totality of society. No easy task, I'd say.

You can buy a straight razor for $10 incl. shipping from Aliexpress (which you will waste *a lot* of time on if you haven't been to a site like that before), but you won't be able to properly shave with it, because the steel is crap and making decent straight razors is difficult. Then there's the material and build quality of the handle, and so on.

I realize that this is from the same manufacturer, but when you check their FAQ you'll find [this](http://www.coldsteel.com/faqs.html#Made):

*""Our products are manufactured world wide. Most items are made in Japan, USA, Taiwan, or China.""*

So, they source their products (not even just the blades, or the steel) from third parties and rebrand them. Both the blade and the handle in your example are made from very different materials, and I'm sure are different build qualities. Aliexpress has [some kukris](http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale/wholesale-kukri.html?SearchText=kukri&amp;CatId=0&amp;manual=y&amp;SortType=price_asc&amp;SortType=y&amp;filterCat=100007134,14200306,200003336) that are even ""Cold Steel"" branded for $18 incl. shipping from China for single orders. Imagine what they cost if you buy wholesale. You can find cheap kukris on Amazon.de as well. ""Quality stuff"", this is not.

Anyway, your other example is made of a better steel (although some research reveals that it's not that great, either), and that vendor is trying to rip you off by trying to market it as something exclusive. This used to be priced at $665 on [Amazon US](http://www.amazon.com/Cold-Steel-Gurkha-Kraton-Secure-Ex/dp/B000WAHC0O/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341324382&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=cold+steel+kukri+San+Mai+III) as well, but now others are selling it for less so it has been priced down to keep up with the competition.

Not this again. You don't ""kickstart"" the economy by burning money on it. When money is scarce, the worse thing you can do is to waste the one you still have.

Demand can't be increased by government spending. I mean, sure, it's nice to receive government funding and it might seem the economy is growing with money injections but it's not sustainable and it's just inflation. Look at the Greek debt, since ~2005 they've been spending more than they could afford and where's their kickstart? Why aren't they having an economic boom?

Those malinvestments are short term measures to make the charts look better, but they just come right back to bite you when interest kicks in. If you want to invest in the economy, fine, but as with all investments, the expected returns need to be higher than the cost, and simply ""kickstarting the economy"" by throwing money around is the wrong way of doing it.

Regarding the downturn, a lot of it is actually the malinvestments we've done in the past proving how worthless they are. For example, all the stadiums we built in 2004 for the Euro helped our economy, a lot of money was being spent, people were employed and things looked great. But what about all those millions we spent, are they any good for us now? No, what's left of it is just abandoned building and debt. On the charts it looks like our GDP grew and is now shrinking, but the situation is the same. It's just that this kind of spending is simply not viable on the long run.

Besides, companies that prove to be economic viable without government funding need not to worry, they'll continue to be open for business. Those who don't, then it will be less of a burden for us all, the taxpayers can't afford to support investments that prove to be economically nonviable. Don't worry, there are plenty of economies that can flourish without government funding.

&gt;We shouldn't be doing austerity in Europe, it doesn't work, it had its chance.

Austerity is simply not spending more of what you can't afford. What got us to where to where we are now was precisely that. Besides, even you say interest is taking a heavy toll. Non-austerity will just make it much worse, firstly the interest rates would go up just because that's hardly a viable strategy and riskier investments raise the interest rates and secondly because that implies we'd have to contract more loans to go back to spending more of what we can afford. The last thing we need right now is borrowing more money, you're right when you say interest rates are a considerable expense, please don't argue for their increase by saying we need to ditch austerity.",0,1341328303,null,0,false,0,c58wf7k,t3_vy6t7,t1_c58wf7k,t1_c58vze7,null,1429287203,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Which is why they won't agree. As you said, it was pretty stupid of that one state to go at it alone, they probably had assumed that Amazon would swallow it because they already had their warehouses, trained employees and infrastructure in place.  
But Amazon had no choice, no matter the cost. They had to set an example, because their business is online selling and that there are no taxes is a huge advantage for their business model. It will pay off in the long run.

The reason why they won't agree is that jobs and (possibly) state income tax are better than nothing at all, and Amazon has demonstrated that you lose what you have if you get too greedy and try to collect sales taxes from them. So, for states that don't do that and are already a home to a large online retailer like Amazon, it's a competitive advantage. If I was to set up a warehouse for an online store, I'd put it into a state where Amazon is, *because* they have this proven willingness to play hardball. 

We might see something similar with EU integration. There is no way Ireland would agree to something like harmonized tax rates for businesses.

You did not address the [multiplier effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_multiplier). Which by the way also works in reverse, when you do austerity.
  
You did not explain how do you propose to go back to growth without destroying everything in the process.  
  
You did not explain how those great companies you're talking about will survive everyone deleveraging at the same time when there will be no demand for several years and when the banks that could finance their projects are zombies,  unless the deleveraging is helped by some form of inflation (i.e. money printing).  
  
Austerity sadly doesn't work to lower our interest rates either, austerity combined with the aforementioned multiplier effect has shown to lower your GDP a lot faster than it solves the deficit problem. So I don't really see how that helps our debt to GDP ration and our interest rates. 

Belgium was in a comparable economic situation to us, they did no austerity since they had no government and they seem to be doing a lot better.

You were the one we are suppose to stop with the austerity and kickstart the economy. So tell me, how would you afford to get more loans and create growth?

Regarding the multiplier effect and aggregate demand, it's all very nice till you notice that our consumption is mostly of imported products. The ""make loans -&gt; give the money away -&gt; increased consumption -&gt; increased production -&gt; increased employment -&gt; economic growth"" formula comes crashing down when the production and employment you're created is in Southeast Asia and not in your closed economy. We've already done plenty of that and the only thing left from it is the loans to pay off, because the economic growth never came.

&gt;You did not explain how do you propose to go back to growth without destroying everything in the process. 

Destroying everything? If by everything, you mean government subsidies to everything and other waste, sure, nuke that. That's only a burden to us all. If it's economically viable, then it will certainly not be destroyed. If it isn't, it should have been destroyed long before it dragged us down with it.

Regarding the companies, it's a globalized world, companies can survive and prosper even with reduced internal demand. Also, the way you're talking, it seems all demand came to an halt. It didn't.

&gt;I don't really see how that helps our debt to GDP ration and our interest rates.

It helps in not getting us any more debt. That's the main issue. Would stopping this and spending help us more with the debt than the current situation?

Their productivity rates are not comparable to ours.

See here is their eternal mistake and bias. They never add up the risks and consequences to the environment. How much do nuclear accidents cost? How much does nuclear security development cost? In cases like Chernobyl or Fukushima, the question is how to ever estimate the total cost?

I don't think this is true. They must be talking about visas other than the tourist one. Or maybe the tourist visa isn't really a visa, technically. You can definitely enter the country without health insurance.

as I understand it the ruling is about those. When you buy a software you mainly buy the license to use it and when you don't need it anymore you can sell that license.

From a cursory point of view, both PO and PiS are right-wing parties, but in reality PO and PiS are two very different parties both reflecting the polarized nature of Polish society and politics. The liberal PO reflects the pro-European, internationalist, liberal and comparatively secular vision of society shared by one half of Poland, that is the more urban and more affluent Poland. The conservative PiS reflects a Eurosceptic, deeply clerical, socially conservative and very nationalist vision of society held by the other half of Poles, that is the more rural and less affluent Poland. On moral issues, PiS is the most vocally socially conservative force though PO is not by any means a social liberal party. On economic issues, at least in rhetoric, the conservative PiS is far more dirigiste and in favour of state intervention than the liberal PO, which originally supported a flat tax, radical red-tape trimming measures and privatizations.",0,1341358042,null,0,false,0,c593qxj,t3_vzr8d,t1_c593qxj,t3_vzr8d,null,1429290721,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

So, given your limited timeframe, I would say that you should just try to get a grasp of the basics before you get there.There are a number of online sites you can use for free.  (http://www.learnalanguage.com/learn-italian/) for example. Listen to italian shows/music on youtube with subtitles. I actually still do this to keep my italian up. Just having a basic grasp of the language and its grammar will help you tons and your latin will definitely help you with root words.

Your biggest growth will occur once you are there. Immersion is the best way to learn a language. You should try (and I didn't do this in the beginning and kinda regret it) to speak English as little as possible. Make italian friends. Go to italian bars/cafes/bookstores/shops and just get talking. Find an italian boyfriend/girlfriend/platonic friend. The best way is to just practice the language.That way you pick up on the slang and the nuances more than any program can teach you.

Oh and another thing that may help: if you can't afford Rosetta stone you can use cheaper free programs and maybe buy a used (cheap) into to italian textbook to get a grasp of the grammar. Rosetta is great but there are definitely cheaper alternatives.

http://media.conservatives.s3.amazonaws.com/manifesto/cpmanifesto2010_lowres.pdf

If the UK Conservatives were to move to the right they'd have to go through the US Democrats before they got to the Republicans.  They're fiscally conservative and measured.  US Republicans are fiscally brash.  The Conservatives have just launched a Green Investment Bank, US Republicans line up to question climate change and to lobby for lower environmental controls.  UK Conservatives launched unpopular austerity to protect the UK's AAA rating, US Republicans pushed extending the credit ceiling to the 11th hour ensuring the US lost theirs.  

In all of the Republican primaries there was but one candidate that could even remotely have been considered a plausible candidate in the UK:  Huntsman, [Jon Huntsman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Huntsman,_Jr.), and his candidacy amongst fellow Republicans was quickly quashed.  The Conservatives are actually quite a broad spectrum and only at the one extreme with people like Daniel Hannan is there any sort of bordering on a US mainstream similitude, and the chances of him holding any cabinet office in parliament any time in the foreseeable are remote, even if he were an MP (which he's not).

The Conservatives ring fenced NHS spending and cut the Defence budget; Republicans fought tooth and nail for no health provision and to protect Defense spending.  The Republicans love tax cuts, the Conservatives have a penchant for introducing tax, even as it turns out on the city, and are pushing the General Anti-Abuse Rule to cut down on tax avoidance.

Either way the cost of oil and gas cost the same everywhere. This is important because these commodities impact everything else that happens in the economy from energy production to agriculture.

What this means is that there is a shared base cost to a Big Mac sold everywhere. What varies between economies and what impacts most to the price of the Big Mac is the cost of labor, that again is largely depended on general wage levels in exporting industries, which again are determined on their level of competitiveness and ability to add value. What we get is that the price of Big Mac varies between countries, but that isn't the question we actually like to ask.

The question we want to ask is how many Big Macs one can buy after taxes and obligatory costs such as housing, transportation etc.. For example while Finnish worker in McDonalds can easily afford to also eat in it also, the same can't be said about McD worker in India.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"Have you asked who are pro nationalists and who are pro democratic?

From my point of view let me list a collection of European countries that have ran nationalistic policies during the crisis...

* France and Germany - The Greek bailout was designed to save their banks. In good times they collected all the tax revenues generated from these banks, and in bad times they put all Eurozone countries to pay to save them.
* Greece - For the last decade the Greek political leadership have ran a fraud which have afforded them to provide benefits to their citizens, however after the party was over nobody from the political or intelligent leadership have come forward and declared that there is needs to be a change on how country is run. The only new voices coming out of Greece have been those demanding Europe to pick up the bill and collection of explanations on why its Europes duty to pick up the bill.
* Spain - Essentially the same sin as France and Germany have committed. In good times enjoy from tax revenues collected from booming construction and banking industries acting in a feeding loop, while in bad times moving the bill to the European taxpayer.

These all countries have run very nationalistic policies, they have concentrated on either getting benefits or minimizing damages to their economies and they have failed to contribute back to the union. For example if France, Germany and Spain would have contributed back to the union, for example by transferring taxation of banks and financial institutions to the union, I would have said that it was fair game. However they haven't done that, they have Europeanized their costs, but have retained their ability to gain benefits from the saved institutions.

&gt;In 2005, I told a senior ECB official that it was unfair to force other countries to rescue Germany by boosting their economies with loose monetary policy without requiring Germany to administer fiscal stimulus, when it was Germany that had become so deeply overextended in the bubble. The official responded that that is what a unified currency means: because Germany could not be granted an exception on fiscal stimulus, the only option was to lift the entire region with monetary policy.

[Koo on German Bubbles](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/06/21/1053921/koo-on-german-bubbles/)

""Picture yourself back in the bursting of the IT bubble, which hit Germany hard. The Nasdaq-like Neuer Markt plunged 96 per cent in value before shuttering in 2002.

According to Koo, a balance sheet recession struck the German economy. As Germans increased savings, aggregate demand decreased. With fiscal policy somewhat constrained by the Stability and Growth Pact (not really, but a little), the ECB had to step in (our emphasis)""

&gt;Germany’s actual fiscal deficits modestly exceeded that threshold on several occasions, but the resulting fiscal stimulus was far from sufficient to prop up the economy. The ECB therefore took its policy rate down from 4.75% in 2001 to a postwar low of 2% in 2003 in a bid to rescue the eurozone’s largest economy.

""But those ultra-low rates still had little impact on Germany, where balance sheet problems were forcing businesses and households to minimize debt.

We could take the Conservative's approach during the 1980s out of context from what went on under Edward Heath in the 70s (and Jim Callaghan's Labour), as being indicative, but we'd also have to remember to forget that it was the trade unions that actually campaigned for Thatcher in 1979 under the banner *'Trade Unionists For A Conservative Victory'* and that Thatcher's first political position was for the Conservative Trade Unionists.  Tebbit himself was president of the CTU - and that's a helluva big political cannon to have in a position *if* the party doesn't rate it.  When you consider that in the UK over 27% of the workforce is represented by a union, compared to 12% in the US, it quickly becomes clear that the Conservatives by no means throw those votes away.    We'd also have to ignore that the trade unionists have only just recently threatened to withdraw their support from Ed Miliband's Labour.  In a recent Guardian poll 76% voted that Labour and the trade unions were no longer in sync.  Len McCluskey, the General Secretary for Unite, has even threatened the 'destruction' of the Labour party if it doesn't conform, with Ed Miliband and Alan Johnson both coming back with their own barbed words.  Of the 58 trade unions in the TUC only 15 are affiliated with Labour, and when the Unite union's members were polled in 2009 a third revealed that they were intending to vote Conservative.  


David Cameron's vision of *'Big Society not Big Government'* is of itself trade union speak.  That's exactly where it happens with trade unionists representing most volunteer work and provision outside of government.  It's not a recent renegotiation in the relationship either, Cameron is in fact going back to the very original Conservative grass roots - trade unions were legalised in the UK under a Conservative Prime Minister by a Royal Commission he himself set up.

It's easy to assume that the Conservatives and trade unionists are polarised and diametrically opposed, but historically and in actuality it's simply not true.  From the pdf below, John Monks, former General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress (so representative of the UK trade unions as a whole), once joked:    
 
                  ""Labour are our friends and often disappoint us.
                   The Conservatives are our enemies and often pleasantly surprise us.""

Can you see a prominent trade unionist in the US describing the Republicans as 'often pleasantly surprising'?

In comparison the US Republicans are outright campaigning to ban collective bargaining!  UK Conservatives are here; US Republicans are *waaay* over there.  There's no way, no how, the Conservatives could or would propose actual anti-union laws like what's being proposed by Republicans in the US in states like Wisconsin and Ohio.

true,Britzer,BERL,Berlin,"Ich verstehe auch nicht ganz, warum, aber offenbar hat man uns weiß gemacht, dass es billiger ist die Banken zu retten, als sie nicht zu retten. Stimmt das? Oder besser gesagt: Stimmte das? Wie auch immer. Es ist ein wenig müßig darüber zu reden. Aber leider wurde versäumt anschließend die Banken an die Kette zu legen. Sowohl in den USA, als auch in Europa. Und nun vermuten die Märkte (also wir), dass die Regierungen für eine zweite Bankenrettung nicht mehr genug Kohle haben. Der Fehler ist also zu wenig Bankenregulierung (wir brauchen gar nicht so viel, die Banken genießen eine unglaublich laxe Regulierung, da müssten nur ein paar Ausnahmen abgeschafft werden) . Der Taz-Autor erweckt dagegen den Eindruck, das Problem wäre zu wenig Geld. Obwohl viele denken, dass wir keines mehr hätten. Übrigens kann sich der Staat auch einfach mehr Geld holen. Indem er neue Steuern einführt. 

Letzten Endes ist es doch ein Verteilungsproblem. Ein paar haben Geld, ein paar haben kein Geld. Der Staat verteilt es ziemlich ineffizient. In Griechenland zum Beispiel an Beamte, die nur dafür sorgen, dass Anträge länger dauern. Dummerweise wird bei denen nicht gespart. Der Plan müsste ja eigentlich sein, das System so zu reformieren, dass es effizienter wird. Das ist die Vorgabe der EU. Aber es wird dort gespart, wo es den geringsten Widerstand gibt. Das ist die Realität. Und das ist nicht nur in Griechenland so. So funktioniert eine große Gesellschaft, wo jeder ein kleines Stück weit probiert sich selbst zu helfen. Die, die mehr Einfluss haben, bekommen mehr Geld und dadurch mehr Einfluss und dadurch mehr Geld. Und deshalb konzentriert sich der Reichtum immer oben. Und das immer stärker. Bis es wieder mal kracht. Die USA sind eine bemerkenswerte Ausnahme (bis auf den Bürgerkrieg). Hauptsächlich durch kontinuierliches Wirtschaftswachstum. Das ist das Wichtigste, damit es nicht kracht. Denn wenn kontinuierlich von unten nach oben geschaufelt wird (nicht stetig, sondern mal mehr, mal weniger), dann muss neu dazu kommen, damit die unten keinen Abstieg erleben.

true,AlpoChino,null,null,"&gt; Financial bigwigs were getting big bonuses before state support became the norm in the banking crisis, that's not a result of state intervention.

Yes indeed. But up until that point (state intervention) those same bigwigs and all other employees are -as far as I'm concerned- entitled to *ask* for whatever they want, so long as the bank is still operating as an independent and non-backstopped enterprise.  
The bank's owners (the shareholders) get to approve or reject the wages and bonuses (bonii??)

If the bigwig (to use your word) asks for X millions in wage+bonus, then the bean counters will crunch the numbers and see whether it's prudent for the bank to spend that amount, offset against what the bigwig has done in return for the bank (in every enterprise the amount of revenue an employee generates will normally be higher than what it gets paid in wages, otherwise the enterprise would be *losing* money with that worker.)  
In the end -and depending on the precise laws in every country- the share holders get to vote on the amount or reject the remuneration (yes, a fancy word it's apt here.)  

Normally, once state intervention has taken place and your bank has become **nationalized** (during this crisis *NO BANKS* have gotten that stamp-of-failure stuck on, unfortunately) IMO all employees must get lowly gov't wages just like any other bureaucrat.

true,FTibs,null,null,"The situation in Romania, my country, is dire. The current power is in blietzkreig mode. In one day the changed the Chief of Senate, the Chief of Representatives and the people's lawyer. Now lets go into detail about these events so you understand why this should not happen.

It started with taking the official gazette (Monitorul Oficial) from the parliament and moving it under government control. This gazette is important because any law, ruling or decision needs to be published in it in order to go into effect. Currently being under government control, the gazette is selectively publishing. The changing of the chief of senate took less than 20 minutes to be published by contrast to the Constitutional Court ruling (that PM Ponta will not represent Romania at the EU summit) which has not yet been published (and it's been 6 days).

Now let’s talk about the changes made yesterday.
The people’s lawyer is the only one who can attack the Government Emergency Ordinance to move the Romanian Constitutional Court under government control  - either by making it’s decision advisory or by changing 2 judges .
 In the Romanian Constitutional Court there are 9 judges, 3 named by the House of Representatives, 3 by the House of Senate and 3 by the president. As of some time now although they should be non-affiliated you could say that 4 belong to the opposition 4 to the current power (USL) and 1 to UDMR that is currently neutral. Earlier this year the court ruled as not constitutional the law of cutting pensions as part of the austerity pack (which was proposed by the current opposition) and as a result the VAT was increased to 25% affecting the citizens as a whole. Although this ruling was not favorable there has NEVER been talk of changing judges or making this court advisory. 
The Chief of the House of Senate belonged to the opposition. Parliament rules say that the Chief can only be changed by the party which proposed him. This was not the case.  The new Chief is Crin Antonescu (co-leader of USL) and this position was important because when the President will be suspended, he’s next in line until the Referendum.
As for the House of Representatives, I am not well enough informed to comment. 

All in all this is an obvious attempt of seizing state institutions and if this will be politically sanctioned in upcoming elections remains to be seen.

&gt;For one of the most remarkable examples of this revenant quality of former borders, we need only hop across the Oder-Neisse line to Poland. On the map of post-communist Poland’s election results, one curious division keeps cropping up: the old imperial border between Russia and Prussia/Germany, as it existed when Poland did not, from 1848 to 1918.[...]

&gt;The fit between modern election result and ancient border is almost perfect. But how can this be? The ethnic composition of the region has been shaken up thoroughly since the border last was in effect: following the Second World War, Germans were expelled from areas east of the Oder-Neisse line, and Poles moved in from former Polish areas to the east, now annexed by the Soviet Union.

&gt;Yet in spite of these completely different demographics, the former border keeps resurfacing at Polish national elections – a zombie border indeed. Earlier treatment of this question [10] has offered up a few intriguing hypotheses: The resettled Poles haven’t had the time yet to “get conservative”; the newer Polish areas have richer farmland (or a denser rail network), are thus more likely to have liberal politics. But an answer that fits the question as snugly as the old border fits contemporary election results remains elusive.

&gt;It may seem overly deterministic to link modern election results to ancient borders that no longer exist; but similar claims have been made about election outcomes in France, Ukraine and the United States, to name but a few countries.

I have seen similar tendencies in Romania, as well. **Map:**

Wobei selbst mit Drupal oder Joomla alles besser ist als mit Typo3.
Das ""große Seiten"" Argument ist nur noch mehr Humbug, weil Typo3 nicht eine Funktion hat, die sich (mit  codingkenntnissen) nicht auch in Joomla oder Wordpress abbilden lässt.

Erinnerst du dich an die Google Pressekonferenz in Deutschland wo der eine Spacken von den Typo3 Entwicklern fragt, wann Google das endlich mehr supporten würde und die Pressesprecherin von Google nach Rücksprache mit allen anwesenden Googletechies sagt:""Es tut mir leid, ich weiss nicht was Typo3 ist.""
Ausserhalb .de nutzt niemand Typo3 ...und schon gar nicht ernsthaft. Und das aus gutem Grund...ES IST SCHEISSE.
Jedes Plugin ist inkompatibel zu allem was man gerade installiert hat...und wenn dann wieder ne Backdoor gefunden wird aktualisiert vielleicht irgendein community Mitglied einen Monat später Typo3 aber macht damit alle Erweiterungen unbrauchbar.

http://1337day.com/exploits/18419

Der Code in der neusten Version mag ja ok sein...aber die Community und speziell die Typo3 Webdesigner sind weit unter dem Niveau von echten Programmierern. Ein JPG und zwei javascript Libs machen halt keine wirkliche Theme aus....

http://1337day.com/exploits/17330

Alle diese lokalen CDU Blogs die dieses Jahr gehackt wurden liefen auf Typo3. Das sollte einem doch irgendwann mal zu denken geben. Es gibt kein einigermaßen sicheres Typo3 weil das Niveau der Community zu schlecht ist.

Es wird ja seit Jahren gepredigt:
https://pebosi.net/200812/drupal-vs-typo3-oder-warum-die-deutschen-erst-jetzt-kapiert-haben-das-typo3-tot-ist

As for their NHS policies, read the manifesto I linked to earlier.  The cuts in bureaucracy and reform is all proposed in it.  It's all there in black and white.

Lazy journalism won't address that, but for all it counts it's there.  It's also worth mentioning that even under Thatcher NHS spending went up on average year on year above the rate of inflation.  Even the Lib Dems before the general election planned for massive Primary Care Trust reform dis-empowering them to more local authorities - not too unlike the Conservative proposals.  That too tends to be lost in the journalist maelstrom.

Love them or loathe them, the Conservatives are actually incredibly pragmatic and less reluctant to postpone unpopular but necessary policy in order to woo the electorate - and it is a fact that health spending is one thing that must go up year on year to be maintain, and that in itself is unsustainable unless composite revenue streams are introduced or, in the mid term, at a detriment to other front line services.   It's not nice, but it's a necessity.  Even cutting Trident and nuclear defence, which I'm in favour of, is still a short term sticking plaster and doesn't address the problem.

When you do that you remove transparency from the discussion. You need transparency to make sure that faults are identified and then measures put to fix them. But if we don't have this transparency, if we just keep silent, then there is identification of faults and no pressure to fix them. It is the same thing with the EU budget, the EU auditors haven't signed accounts since ages, and this is mainly fault of handful of countries who are unable to or unwilling to make sure EU funds are properly used and signed off. If there is no external pressure, there is hardly motivation to fix things.

What Europe need more is openness and transparency. Faults needs to identified and addresses, and then common solutions made that ensure that same mistakes aren't made ever again...

Mi sono recato all'ufficio postale e alla mia richiesta la Stronza è sbiancata dicendo che no, non aveva le autorizzazioni necessarie e che sarei dovuto andare in un altro ufficio. Allora io ho tirato fuori la letterina che le poste mi hanno inviato assieme alla sim in cui veniva specificato che potevo recarmi in un QUALSIASI ufficio postale per completare l'attivazione. La tipa si incazza. Io resto impassibile, lei chiama il direttore che se ne lava le mani scaricando tutto su di lei e comincia a dare consigli su chi chiamare. Partono svariate telefonate per conoscere la PROCEDURA (eh sai non è colpa mia, non ci fanno gli aggiornamenti, non so usare il computer, HO PAURA DI SBAGLIARE). La stronza in questione riceve informazioni contrastanti da colleghi di altre filiali...fino a quando uno sicuro di se dice che devo inserire la sim nel cellulare aspettare un sms e che poi sarei dovuto tornare da loro. La stronza me lo passasicura, finalmente, di essersela cavata. Io parlo al telefono con il COLLEGA dico sisi a tutto e metto giù. Allora la stronza mi fa..vede non è colpa mia..è lei che non ha seguito la procedura. Mi incazzo, tiro fuori di nuovo la letterina delle poste e faccio presente che non parla ne di aspettare ne di sms, ma solo di recarmi in ufficio postale con un documento di identità e che non me ne sarei andato fino a quando la questione non si fosse risolta. Crisi, lei diventa paonazza e comincia a sbraitare...si alza e fa...allora faccia lei visto che è così bravo. Guardo il monitor e vedo la voce ""completamento ordine da web"" ci clicco sopra e le dico che semplicemente bastava completare i campi. Allora la negazione, mi fa, no non può essere così semplice. Insisto, 5 minuti dopo l'attivazione è stata completata con sua profonda rabbia.
Al che a attivazione eseguita ho semplicemente ricordato alla STRONZA in questione che ci sono molti giovani in cerca di lavoro e che sarebbe giusto che se uno non sa fare il suo lavoro se ne resti a casa.
Il problema è che speravo di ricevere un applauso dalla gente che aveva assistito a tutto, mi sentivo l'eroe che sconfigge l'ignoranza, il debole che vince sul forte...invece mi hanno mandato a cagare perché erano 2 ore che aspettavano per ritirare la pensione. Vecchi Bastardi.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; Now that we have it, Stellarators become a real contender.

It's interesting to see how those technologies interact, especially since they're all about the same age. That is, if you count theoretical concepts, then computation goes back to Babbage or even the predecessors to Jacquard looms, but anyway, practical research of both Tokomak and Stellarator began in the 50's and the ancestors of modern processors are from roughly the same time period.  
So, here we are, more than half a century later, and progress in an unrelated field might put one design principle that had been falling back in favor of the competing one half way through ahead again. Then again, I'm sure this happens all the time.

Of course I don't understand any of this, but the impression I'm getting from having a quick glance at the concepts is that Stellarators are somewhat more elegant (for once not talking about the aesthetic value here). Is that about right, at least as a gross oversimplification and in the sense that there would be less components and possibly better stability? Could you conceivably power a ship with one of those two designs?

Btw., how would practical fusion reactors work out on the small scale, in terms of size, energy output and cost? I don't expect to have one in my laptop one day, but what I understand is that you put energy in, and you get energy out, and if, say, input scales logarithmically and output linear (or linear and exponentially), there must be some point where the two curves meet, the output can power the input (yes, plus fuel, obviously), and somewhere beyond that it would become cost-efficient.

true,boq,BAVA,near Germany,"&gt; Of course I don't understand any of this, but the impression I'm getting from having a quick glance at the concepts is that Stellarators are somewhat more elegant (for once not talking about the aesthetic value here). Is that about right, at least as a gross oversimplification and in the sense that there would be less components and possibly better stability? Could you conceivably power a ship with one of those two designs?

The reason why you need computational power to master Stellarators is because their magnetic field geometry (and thus the entire plasma) cannot be analytically solved. It's way more complicated than the simple Tokamak equilibrium. That's why numerical solutions are needed. To be clear, Tokamaks also need numerical analysis, although only to solve higher-level problems. Basic Tokamaks that can be operated in the regime that ITER will have (H-mode, for ""high confinement""), have been around for almost 30 years now.

So the additional complexity of the Stellarator magnetic field topology is also a possible source of instability. Unfortunately I don't know enough about them to tell you whether there will be a problem in the future or not. Let's hope it won't.

About that ship... probably? The bigger you make it, the easier it is to confine the hot plasma. I'm not sure it will be economical or practical to put such a big reactor on a freighter in the end. (In space, eventually, on water, don't know.)

&gt; Btw., how would practical fusion reactors work out on the small scale, in terms of size, energy output and cost? I don't expect to have one in my laptop one day, but what I understand is that you put energy in, and you get energy out, and if, say, input scales logarithmically and output linear (or linear and exponentially), there must be some point where the two curves meet and somewhere beyond that it would become cost-efficient.

There will probably never will be a small fusion reactor unless we figure out how to produce cheap muons. Then we can do cold fusion ;-)

We have this equation called the Lawson criterion. The triple product of density, temperature and confinement time must exceed a certain threshold to achieve break even, i.e. external heating + fusion heating = power loss, or even ignition, i.e. the plasma heating itself enough to continue the process all by itself (although still requiring external magnetic fields). [These slides (from slide 9 onwards)](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:2gW-43DtbbkJ:www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/cfsa/people/pastmembers/peeters/teaching/lecture2.ppt+&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=de&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgpBXB7Jez6Mgs8qbbr9JckzAB-lYsjv0z39WB1Ex62SBs8cI-dF-tQYcoz9IIkr09W4reyA8lBPQSKsOz560Wh3F1r9j1CcaAuD2TcfmsNUdIgSIVhEjjhbCCZ95CU4egtkctl&amp;sig=AHIEtbTS6N0qBfI9_DCEYTlpoACYtv-tMQ&amp;pli=1) illustrate it. As you can see, fusion power scales with a square, power loss is linear. On slide 16 you can see how close we are. So far, the achieved triple product doubles in less than 18 months, so we can claim to be better than the chip researchers ;-)

&gt; On a side note, ITER's cost seems to be €15bn. Almost peanuts compared to the other figures we've gotten used to on this subreddit. Wendelstein 7-X will come in under a billion, that's about ten Eurofighters, and 300 of those are planned.

People lose certain portions of their freedoms and start hopping over to the other side, which quite frankly needs new blood. They are definitely in dire need of people like you. 

I ain't going to deny that this is going to be easy or that we won't face casualties, but the bottom line is the sooner humanity gets their act together the more of future casualties can be avoided. We still have working infrastructure and not so fubar'd industry that enables swift and painless victory (industry is going to slowly start reaching to its death and thus make transition to something new very difficult, thus it is important to act sooner rather than later). If for some reason majority refuses to play the game in upcoming decades then I seriously doubt anyone has potential resources available to alleviate the outcome.

Moreover, if nothing is to be done then I feel the same scenario is going to take place that happened at the very beginning: maxed profiteering their way up and maxed profiteering their way down. Also, I think it is fair to say that you should crush your hopes into establishment at this very moment, because they are not even trying to do anything. They are politicians, they run and work only when the there is a demand for it, they are not ahead of the public, thus expect massive delays that will lead to an end with over 90% of success rate. 

I'm going to end my little frustrating tale with a great quote from Bill Hicks: 

&gt;The world is like a ride at an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it, you think it's real, because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round and it has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very loud. And it's fun, for a while.

&gt;Some people have been on the ride for a long time, and they begin to question: 'Is this real? Or is this just a ride?' And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and they say 'Hey! Don't worry, don't be afraid -- ever -- because... this is just a ride.' And we kill those people.

&gt;'Shut him up! We have a lot invested in this ride! Shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry; look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real.' It's just a ride. But we always kill those good guys who try and tell us that -- ever notice that? -- and we let the demons run amok. But it doesn't matter, because... it's just a ride, and we can change it any time we want. It's only a choice. No effort. No worry. No job. No savings and money. Just a choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your door, buy bigger guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love, instead, see all of us as one.

&gt;Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, into a better ride.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"Lets start from the 250€ apartment that includes heating and water. The heating and water costs are so minimal for few reasons...

* In almost all Finnish towns heating is organized via district heating system. In this system there is one or multiple power stations that besides producing electricity produce heat that is then distributed via pipe network to all over the town. Even larger city like Helsinki is heated this way.
* Utility companies from heating to water are ran either as for profit corporations or as for profit public agencies. They don't get public funding, but have to rely on revenues that they generate from selling services such as electricity, heat, water, etc.. Thus they have internal impetus to be as efficient as possible.
* Also some of these corporations like the Helsinki Energy are so profitable that they pay big dividends every year, for example last year they gave 200mil € to the city. All the while keeping heating costs down.

Housing itself is cheap because there is continuous build up new properties that make older apartments cheaper. In Turku you can buy an 70s apartment, form approx 30 to 40 sq meters, with about 40 - 50 thousand euros.

What goes to food, when I was a student and later when founded by own company I used approx 5-6 euros to food per day. Now when I have moved on, high paying job in Helsinki, daily costs for food is approx 10 euros.

I gave these examples because things can be cheap if they are efficiently organized. For example in the case of heating, oil and gas and coal cost the same in Greece and in Finland, but how you burn them and how you use the heat decides on how much return you can get.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"So, if I got that right, then while output scales with a square and loss is linear, the factors aren't constant and you're making impressive progress with them, and the answer to my question about size is currently still ""close to ITER's, if you have something nearby to repeatedly power the ignition"". I've driven past the ITER complex... uhm... keep up the good work. :)

What I was aiming at with my question about fusion powered ships was that they're not static and the confinement moves along with it.

&gt; Tell the federal government, they are slashing the domestic fusion budget from EUR 125m to 120m.

So, cut by about one Leopard II, from less than 1.5 Eurofighters.

The thing with budgets like this is that, wherever you look and the more you know about a topic, it's always too low. I like to put things into perspective in relation to military equipment, because those are investments that (ideally) have no payoff at all, but even there somebody who knows a lot about it would probably be able to make a good argument that we need e.g., more ships to protect trade routes and so on. My preferred solution to raise taxes wouldn't be able to solve all of this, either, because at some point consumption would take too much of a hit and if you'd add up the many individual ""ideal spending levels"", you'd probably end up somewhere well above 100% GDP.  
*However*, the thing with spending on education and research, from kindergarten over universities to projects like ITER, is that the long-term  ROI is so enormously huge, it's just not within the time frame of the electoral cycle (or, perhaps more problematic, the consequences of the cuts aren't).  
The graph you linked to illustrates this beautifully, or rather, reveals the enormous ugliness of this. Fusion reactors specifically have the potential to solve the most pressing issues of our time -- energy supply and everything that goes with it, from Climate Change to the geopolitical consequences of energy dependency. We could conceivably even power desalination plants to irrigate the deserts to make them arable one day (yes, I know both the power and desalination plants wouldn't be free, but still), and eliminate two potential causes for conflict this way (i.e., water and food supply). It makes you wonder if our politicians have ever even played Sid Meier's Civilization. Focusing on science works well for me there. My suspicion is that they haven't.

Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions here, btw. :)

 Erst die tollen Neuigkeiten über diese ganze Higgs-Boson-Sache, dann habe ich [/r/flossdaily](/r/flossdaily) entdeckt, und schließlich noch morgen Stundenausfall in der Schule.

Und dann muss ich so etwas lesen. 

Diese absolute Inkompetenz der Behörden, die uns als ""Erfolg"" verkauft wird, mit schönen gefälschten Statistiken und allem Tata drum herum. Diese Hochnäsigkeit von den Leuten, die hohe Ämter besetzen, und die Leute, die diese Ämter nicht nach fachlicher Kompetenz, sondern nach politischer Zugehörigkeit vergeben. 

Die Leute, die ihre ""Intelligenz"" dafür verschwenden, für diese Kriminellen noch Rechtfertigungspläne zu entwerfen, so a `la ""Sozialbetrug"" oder unangemeldete Einbrüche in die Privatsphäre, wegen ein paar lausiger Euro.

 Die Bürger, die so etwas noch freudig bejahen, weil sie in ihrer flimmernden Verblödungsbox nur den faulen Abschaum zuhause rumstreiten sehen.

Die Medien, die nur noch voneinander abschreiben, um dann auch noch für ihre Unfähigkeit, selbst nachzuforschen und attraktive Angebote für ihre intellektuellen und jungen Leser im Netz Inhalte vernünftig bereitzustellen, in bester Schmarotzermanier ""Leistungsschutzrecht"" fordern und es doch fast tatsächlich geschafft hätten, den Mist auch noch durchzubringen.

Die Redakteure des Spiegel, die es geschafft haben, innerhalb kürzester Zeit die über Jahrzehnte hinweg mit Herzblut und journalistischer Kühnheit erarbeitete unabhängige und qualitativ anspruchsvolle Reputation des ""SPIEGELS"" und der Fachpresse mit sensationalisierenden Titeln und schlampiger Recherchearbeit komplett in den Dreck zu ziehen.

Die Leute, die es schaffen, jeden Tag zu überleben, ohne sich eine Kugel zu setzen, angesichts des Berufs, den sie Tag für Tag ausüben und damit die Gesellschaft vom Fortschritt zurückhalten. Hier seien besonders die Mitarbeiten von RTL, McDonald's, Investmentbanken, Marktforschungsinstuten, Werbeunternehmen und den Unternehmen, die Produkte mit geplanter Obsoleszenz bauen, genannt.

Hoffentlich ändert sich das und vieles mehr, sodass ich einfach nur in der falschen Zeit geboren bin und unsere Nachfahren es besser haben.

Mannomann, war das deprimierend. Wenigstens schön zu sehen, dass die faz die Fahne des Qualitätsjournalismus' noch ein wenig in die Höhe hält, obwohl ihre Redakteure ja leider schrecklich unterbezahlt sind.

First try couchsurfing and every similar web, as someone said the best option is to just party all night and skip the sleeping part, if you are going there in a car that should be fine (for your knowledge Kalea means street, don't get it wrong and ask people where kalea street is when looking for your car...) 

Another alternative some of my friends used was going in the morning to the public swimming pool and just sleep there during the day, it's got showers, shade and lot's of messed up people, pretty fun. 

And if you have good social skills you could just ask for someone to let you sleep in their house, pamplona is a student town and most of the students go back for san fermin (in my 4 bedroom flat we fitted 20 people one year).

In short, you can safely ignore Photism because he's sort of a fanatical anti-PDL guy, which would be ok cause they're all dirty too -though not to the extent of PSD-, but it seems he can only see the bad doings of one party, which is unfortunate and provides a narrow view of things.",0,1341441551,null,0,false,0,c59ht42,t3_w1ji1,t1_c59ht42,t1_c59fyga,null,1429297490,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8
