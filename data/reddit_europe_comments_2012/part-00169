true,MissBabaganoosh,null,null,"""Just to feel more smug than you already do? Just so you can hang it over our heads and feel better about yourself?"" I'm going to answer your entire response. No, it has nothing to do with feeling superior to anyone, it has to do with the fact that I am an american expat, an american that sits in another country and watches while the rights of my family and friends are taken away more and more each year. One who sends money to friends that are on the verge of losing everything because of the outrageous medical bills that they have, including my mother. I don't say things like that to be smug or take cheap shots, I say them because I genuinely DO care, and it hurts me to watch as my friends live in pain because they cannot get treatment for various conditions, or lose there homes because of their mounting bills (the last friend of mine I sent money to almost lost his home, he has 3 children that would've been on the streets.)

 I also say these things because I spent three of my younger years on the streets in the states. I have eaten out of dumpsters, and have 2 shards of an unknown material forever in my skull from an attack while hitch hiking in california, if there was a universal healthcare system in the states, I could've gotten the surgery I needed to remove them.

So before you assume that someone is making a statement for 'karma' or to feel smug or superior, you should talk to that person, you never know someone else's story. I don't blame you for how you feel, and I understand why you get heated, as a lot of the comments about these issues are made by silly students that don't actually know what they are talking about. But it is much better to focus that anger on some sort of work to help change the system, or help those in need. Volunteer to help those families and people that have lost everything, protest, hell even the smallest acts of kindness can bring indescribable joy to someone who needs it.
