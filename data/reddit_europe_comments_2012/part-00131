If there is more demand than supply prices will rise, if the situation is vice versa, then prices will go down. If you artificially dictate prices, freeze them in a level, that will only mean that those who have rented apartment will save money, but it doesn't decrease for apartments because there won't magically be more housing available.

The correct way to fix the situation is increase supply, by building more apartment, and making those apartments that are not in demand due to location more lucrative by building better transit options.

Another option is to move public services to places were there are more housing available.

true,Agramenauer,null,null,"The article is interesting, and makes some great rebuttals. There are a few points I dont truly agree too. In the first part, when he talks about the debt, he makes a logical correction (actual debt versus invented debt) that seems completly logical. But then he goes to mention the 8%  (no references to other ways to calculate it, pretends it has been like that since the begining of democracy, when with the same calculation when there was superavit was around 0'5%). The same argument he uses for ""It was Spain who took the debt"" could also go the other way for people claming that any infastructures not built by the Seneralitat is therefore still part of Spain. And no one same would start pretending to commision your infraestructure. The active part he forgets to note that there are also actives in Spain based in Catalonia, not some kind of one sided trade. The point about actually paying the bill is controversial. I don't really know if there is no jurisdiction about that, I believe he is probably right, but just picture the backlash it would have in the economy. Just like any other country trying to skip paying some debt, it would make new debt selling incresingly difficult, and not be a good way to enter the market. If it was that simple, refounding Spain as Iberian League and saying we no longer hold old Spain's debt (even leaving Madrid as old Spain to declare state bankrupcy) is something I dont believe would work. 

Some things like thinking that getting shares in BCE would mean automatic entrance in the Euro seems way too farfetched and borderline speculation. The point about not being able to enter international market is just a play of words. They are already there, using the euro as their currency. And, seriously, where does the (40% of the taxes would be reduced with independence) come from? Is it that fucking much? I would be way more understandable of the situation if that figure is actually true.

A pity is the lack of comments in the blog, which could have probably solved many of these questions by people way more informed than I am.

EDIT Just found what is the 40% he is talking about. He forgets to mention that, as he admits, if they got the independence the recaudatory loss would end up being the same. And fails to mention that with the same formula, again some other states rate is even higher

&gt;No it doesn't. And I'm not really sure what you're trying to say with the following paragraph. It's poetic and all, but it really doesn't mean much for the current discussion.

Our discussion is about the history of Transylvania and the relation of the Romanian and Hungarian people to that land. Everything what took place there relates to this subject including the (greater number of) events before the last 300 years. History of a thousand year, the continuous sacrifices of the people, the struggle of  life and death for centuries are not just “poetic and all”, it defines Transylvania itself as how we know it today. I understand your point and agree that big words about the ""great"" past might sound foolish and stupid nowadays, but please don’t disrespect that history if you can, please accept that there is more to it than you might think:-)


.
&gt;Half the Romanian population of Transylvania was Greek-Catholic (Uniate) after 1700.

Yes significant amount of the Romanian population were Greek-Catholic indeed, but I was talking about the status-quo, the fact that Hungary was a western-catholic since St Stephan the first violently forced everybody to change their religion to Roman Chatolic in the country and from that point, the border of the  European western-Catholicism was the eastern-border of the country of Hungary (Roman or Protestantism is irrelevant since they are both considered western). 
I think it’s safe to say that the science of history still has a lot to learn the past of Christianity in the region.


.
&gt;How can you rule something out when you don't have evidence. Remember, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

You just drop it and rule it out with other studies from different scientific fields. You skip archeology and study the language, the mythology, genetics, etc…


.
&gt;I'd like to see that pole. Link? (Doesn't matter if it's a Hungarian link)

I would love to, but I don’t remember who said it or when, it was a long time ago:/ However, after some Googling I found an English PDF referencing the same thing, perhaps this was it:

[*“The same confusion concerning the motivation of the confessional identity was revealed in the 18th century by the Romanians from Transylvania. A religious investigation started in the same year when the United Church was founded (1699) and by which Romanians were asked to specify their options, showed that the new confession was perceived more through its socio-political aspects rather than the Florentine spirit, or any serious debate. At that time, the generous idea of catholicization as a spiritual return of the Romanians to their Latin origins was not yet outlined in the public perception ^32 .”*](http://byzantinohungarica.hu/sites/default/files/remus_angol_nilles.pdf)

I hope it helps.



.
&gt;You have no way of knowing the language of those interred in those graves. Think about it this way: when the Magyars changed their culture from nomadic pagans to sedentary Christians, they did not loose their language.

Please note that we don't really know how the Magyars lived. We know a lot of thing like they had their own alphabet and knew how to read and write, so they might have been not so paganic after all, (or at least not all of them), and some study suggest that perhaps they were already eastern or kopt christian when they are arrived, but yes, they did not lose it ofc. No ethnic group lost its language easily to any oppression, and especially not in a few hundred years. But the German and the Slavic influence were huge on the Hungarian language since there was no way to avoid that.
This would surely apply to the Dacian language as well with the Gepids (German) and the Avars (turk) and the others, especially that the Gepids and Avars massively outnumbered any other ethnic group in their prime time in Transylvania. 
(edit: afaik scientist say that they can't really ""detect"" the influence of those two periods on the Romainan language)

I’m not an expert on the field, but I know that linguistics scientist are advancing in an insane rate in the last few years, and I’m curious about the link what [rusoved](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10gwhs/are_romanians_descendede_from_local_latinized/c6dk00s) posted in the other thread. Is there any truth in that? 



.
&gt; So we do have evidence.

evidence of something “Latin”, but those are not evidences of a continuous presence of a Daco-Roman culture, or did I miss something? It’s like the “double conquest” theory Hungarians have. You can back it up with lots of archeological and linguistic (Oghuric Turkic) evidences if you want, you can have quite a convincing argument as well, but it’s still not a proven theory.



.
&gt;It doesn't look that way. But a terra nullius narrative always favors the latest conquerors. 

Are you suggesting that the Hungarians exterminated or assimilated the Romanian culture there in the X-XII century? I never heard anything like that tbh. I don’t know about any record which claims that the Hungarians denied the existence or tried to hide/ignore any ethnic group in their territory, yet, I’m curious where are the Romanians from Transylvania then when Hungarians arrived?

A lot of them could probably rebute point by point everything that I said or at least show some facet about it that I missed (although X is true, you need to take into account Y). I have also heard a lot of scholars saying independence is not viable, from the ""they will suffer a 20% loss of PIB"" to something close to a zombie appocalypse.

Darmstadt is a city of 140k and very close to Frankfurt - 17mins or 34mins on the train (ICE/RB vs S-bahn), FFM airport 20mins by car. Has a totally different feel of course being much smaller. Personally I prefer the small city atmosphere (Although the nightlife kind of sucks in my opinion, have to go to Frankfurt for an excellent night out, which can be expensive.)

true,Ozires,FINL,Finland,"Hah, how nice. I hope you enjoyed your stay and it wasn't too cold or socially awkward. Y'know if you're not bored to death of this it I'll write down some peculiarities about Finnish, you never really think about this stuff except when you start comparing. We actually only have one pronoun for both he and she 'hän' which is really only used in writing. Funny to think we refer to people the same way you refer to animals and don't see anything weird about it at all. Though, in many ways this really compatible with the whole Scandinavian equality thing since we've succeeded in keeping gender away from language that well. It really hits you when you hear stuff like 'herstory' for the first time and think 'jeez! history (historia in finnish) is really 'his story'.

The actual language though is very difficult for a foreigner to learn so I don't judge you at all. For example, we don't have prepositions like indo-european languages, we add suffixes to words to note what grammatical case they're in. It can be really confusing since there's loads of suffixes (we have 15 different cases) and some of them even have two different forms depending on which works better with the stem of the noun/adjective. Just to pick a few 'as something' is -na/-nä, 'in something' is -ssa/-ssä, 'from something' is -sta/stä.

House is 'talo'
as a house = talona
in a house = talossa
from a house = talosta

Human is 'ihminen'
as a human = 'ihmisenä'
in a human = 'ihmisessä'
from a human = 'ihmisestä'

Best of all, as you can see, you can't always even know what the stem that you're supposed to add the suffixes to, is since sometimes it needs to be altered a bit to make it compatible. And it doesn't really help that the words look pretty weird are pronounced so differently than in indo-european languages. I find the pronouniation is actually pretty close to that of Japanese.

true,Vespasianus,NETH,The Netherlands,"* Foreign languages weren't a requirement. I took French (the same level I had when I was about 12) but it wasn't necessary. In contrast to my Dutch school where I had to take English, French, German, Latin and Ancient Greek.

* We weren't permitted to carry backpacks or school bags around corridors. No idea why, possibly because of overcrowding?

* Sport class was almost exactly the same, however they didn't educate you at all, it was essentially ""play sports time"" whereas I remember having lessons in the Netherlands about how to exercise properly, calculate BMI, etc.

* Drinking age was 21, therefore no alcohol at school parties. This was really irritating. Not that you have to drink to have a good time, but it made me feel like a child again. 

* The vast majority of school grounds were given over to parking. This amazed me. I eventually got an American driving licence (years later) and it was incredibly easy. After 18 in that particular state, Ohio, you don't need to have evidence of any lessons to get a licence. The test cost $20 and consisted of a simple test around some traffic cones and a drive around the block.

* Speaking your mind is interpreted as insolence. I'm considered very blunt and direct even amongst the very direct Dutch. Needless to say, this didn't go over well. When I had a problem with a fact or the way lessons were presented I would generally approach the teacher about it. They almost always took this in a very bad way and expected me to shut up and deal with it.

* I will preface this observation with this: AMERICANS ARE NOT ALL DUMB. Anyone who thinks that is simply foolish. In secondary school there is obviously an emphasis to 'fit in'. This is present everywhere. However, because schools aren't segregated by intelligence/motivation the average level one has to fit into is potentially way below one's actual intelligence level. Put simply: appearing ignorant is encouraged. I think this sort of carries over into other aspects of life. People want their president to be an 'average guy that you can have a beer with' whereas I would like a president who is several dozen IQ points higher than me. 

* Adding to my above statement, almost no one knew where the Netherlands was. Some knew it was in Europe. I eventually resorted to saying I'm from Amsterdam (queue the self loathing...).

* Questions I was asked:

&gt; Do you wear Peter Pan clothes in the Neverlands?

&gt; Did you take a bus here from Germany *(sic)*?

&gt; That's next to China, right? I'll bet you guys have good Chinese food.

I don't think this was due to these people actually being stupid. It was a combination of the emphasis on being average and the lack of geography courses.

Both side of that(not being allowed to pay good teachers more, or get rid of bad teachers) are based on union contracts taken from the national unions and used in thousands of districts across the country.

There were some differences of course - the people didnt all look like movie stars; the drama sets/costumes were never as professional as the ones in the plays that movie highsachool's put on (and frankly the acting usually sucked in our school plays), but generally speaking - when i was in highschool and i watched a highschool movie, i never thought to myself- ""hey that's totally unrealistic"".

There were the same cliques that were easily identifyable by their dress and outside hangout places; the kids were generally white and upper middle class, but there was enough diversity that there were more than just ""the one"" black, indian, chinese, or korean kid, and eveerybody was vey tolerant- none of the groups hated each other and everybody got along.

our sports, visual arts, science, and music programs were very well supported: financially, by caring teachers, and by enthusiastic students.  We had the obligatory student who died in an accident, we had one pregnancy, and we won our city's football championship.

Agreed.

I would translate ""A beautiful life"" with ""Una vita bella"".

Ich weiß überhaupt nicht mehr, was ich glauben soll. Es ist mir ehrlichgesagt relativ egal. Ich weiß nur, dass ich mich nicht engagiert habe, der Kirche tassenweise Wasser abzugraben, nur um jetzt einer weiteren Religion zuzuschauen, wie sie aus Gründen einer Politik der Nachgiebigkeit irgendwelche weltlichen Zugeständnisse bekommen soll.

Dazu, wer hat, lese in der gestrigen Ausgabe der Faz ""Christentum und Politik"". Da gibt es einen starken Sekularisierungstrend oder zumindest einen Ignoranztrend. Es ist also kein Wunder, dass der Islam so groß durch die Medien geht; wir sind es schlichtweg nicht mehr gewohnt, aus Tradition und Aberglaube unterdrückt zu werden. Unsere konservativen Christen sind schon so subtil geworden, dass da nur noch kommunal, familiär und im verborgenen unterdrückt wird, während alles an der Mediendarstellung des Islams nach Gehirnwäsche schreit. Wie es wirklich ist, weiß wieder niemand. Die Moslems, die ich kenne, halten es mit der Religion ähnlich wie ich, solange man sie in Ruhe lässt denken sie nicht weiter darüber nach. Da fällt es mir schwer, Moselms pauschal scheiße zu finden, auf der anderen Seite ist es mir unmöglich, die ""Bedrohung"", die durch die Medien inszeniert wird, zu ignorieren.

Alles wird zum Politikum aufgebauscht. Da ist diese eine Region, in der jetzt der Islam in Schulen den christlichen Lehren gleichgesetzt werden soll, der getrennte Religionsunterricht abgeschafft und eine dreifaltige Unterrichtseinheit geschaffen werden soll. Auf der einen Seite finde ich das zum kotzen, so werden unsere Kinder mit einer viel größeren Bandbreite irrsinniger Propaganda bombardiert, desweiteren finde ich, dass die religiöse Lehre den Religionsgemeinschaften vorbehalten sein sollte; auf der anderen Seite sehe ich ein, dass dadurch die Chance besteht, dem Religionsunterricht den Glaubensinhalt zu nehmen.

Fremdenfeindlichkeit und Arbeitslosigkeit sind auch ""Teil von Deutschland"", beides prägt das Landschaftsbild aus einer Minderheitenstellung heraus. Nun haben wir, je nach dem welcher Statistik man glauben mag, zwischen 3,5% und 5,5% Muslime in der Bevölkerung, wobei die Zahl vermutlich ganz wo anders liegt, da es kein Register und keine Dokumentation für Muslime gibt und man die Statistik anhand der Migration aus islam-orientierten Staaten erstellt hat. ""Dagegen"" stellen wir nun 30-37% Konfessionslose, deren Ansichten garnicht vertreten werden, weil sie keine Lobby haben. So müssen wir uns also zusammentun und wehren, obwohl wir ja genau das wieder vermeiden wollten, uns zu irgendwelchen Interessengemeinschaften im großen Stil zusammentun.

The big problem with this article is that it implies that the Jobcenter knew about this. What's missing is the word ""unwissentlich"".

It clearly says that the Jobcenter didn't know that it was preliminary work for the search for bombs. They said, they immediately pulled the workers from that project and that they would've never send them there in the first place if they would've know. I have no reason not to believe this. The work was initiated from the municipality and jobs to clean some woods or parks should be pretty normal.

The article says ""halb Plauen"" knows about the bomb. That's a typical German phrase, not the result of a study. Even if you take it literally, the one or two workers at the Jobcenter could've easily been part of the half that doesn't know it.

Overall, it doesn't even say if the works poses any thread to the people. I doubt that people in bomb proof vests will now do it. By the looks of it, the park is near the town center. People do geocaching there. And i doubt it is even fenced off. 

Actually, by using Google you will find that there is an fishing club that does a lot of activities for *children* in that park.

To them they won't. We will have to follow their rules if we want to trade and have relations with them. If we don't, we don't prosper. If we don't prosper, who knows what will happen? Will they invade? Anything can happen.

Now your claims about how our freedom is reduced, because a higher entity dictates rules is garbage. That is the same as saying we don't have freedom, because we have a government, because that is a higher entity too.

Democracy, is sacred and is one of the basic human rights governed by the European Court of Justice. How the European Union works right now is by representative Democracy. National Democracies dictate the way the EU is run through representatives chosen by national elections. On a larger scale, this can be changed and will be changed to direct European in the Future when a European Federation is created. No system is perfect. You have to change to become better to stay good. Changes will happen. Opposing those changes for the sake of just being used to the current system, is not a good idea.

When the currency union was introduced, it was a mistake to assume that more integration, fiscal and monetary union will come by itself. Of course I won't disagree that unemployment has risen, but you and most British Newspapers completely overestimate the problem. It is no way near as bad as some may describe it. I do disagree on the ""stifling labour"" laws part. They are not stifling to the economy, they are stiffling towards the high bosses pocketing in even more money than they currently do. They ensure that workers can earn themselves a decent quality of life. The labour laws that could be stiffling actually come from individual member states themselves (France is a good example)

At the end of the day. Yes, The European Union right now has problems regarding the competitivness of member states and also inflexibility. First of all imagine where those countries would be without the European Union? People forget the bad things to quickly. The EU has brought forward many good things, including free boarders, free labour movement, customs union, single market, human rights of every citizen to be respected everywhere in the EU, and many more things. Second of all, opposing new changes, and wanting to go back to the ""good old days"" and ways of doing things, makes YOU the source of the inflexibility. The European Parliament, Commission etc. , have recognised that things need to be changed. They want the competitivness of Regions to increase, they want to become more flexible to be able to adapt to a rapidly changing world. Sacrifices in Souvereignity need to be made, but are we Europeans so different from one another? I mean aside from the language we speak and the food and drinks we consume, are our values really so different for this not to work? We all value freedom of speech and religion, democracy, human rights, healthcare. Just because some guys have slightly different working hours and structures, does that mean we can't work together? I think we can learn from each other and become better.

Es lag schlicht am abendlichen Lesen ua. von Entsprechendem, dass es beim Schreiben reingerutschte. Wer lieber seine Stereotype bestätigt, dem wird das freilich egal sein.

&gt; Du hältst vielleicht gerne Brandreden.

In Deinen feuchten Träumen. Vermutlich bist Du dir auch wohl bewusst, dass Torah wie Talmud bzw. die damaligen Priester / Rabbiner noch so einiges anderes hinterließen (Bsp. [Frauen](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/zky4d/large_circumcision_study_shows_adverse_sexual/c67k4gf?context=3)), dass auch Du (sowie die meisten weniger orthodoxen Juden heute) zurückweisen bzw. wegrationalisiert haben — ohne sich dabei in die Schublade ""Antisemit"" wegzuwerfen, soviel Unterscheidung zwischen Religion und Angehörigen muss dann sein — und insb. die Ultra-Orthodoxen es meist bloß deswegen nicht tun, weil es nachträglich an (etwa bei den Todesstrafen erst noch wieder einzutretende) Bedingungen geknüpft wurde. Viele der Letzteren werden von der aktuellen Reglung eh [nicht](http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/General+News/140162/Rabbi-Tendler-Calls-Metzitzah-a-Prefabricated-Lie.html) glück[lich](http://forward.com/articles/162762/), die werden Dir dann auch munter dasselbe vorwerfen.

Ähnliches gilt für den Koran (sicherlich auch das NT), bloß leider oft viel expliziter.

&gt; Aber vielleicht fühlst Du Dich auch persönlich betroffen, weil es Dein Dödel sein könnte. Ist er aber nicht. Deshalb hinsetzen, Fresse halten.

Ui, Du bist aber ein echter Menschenkenner! Ganz gleich dass ich ebenso ""betroffen"" wäre, würde es hier um Mädchen gehen. Aber schon klar, Jungs sollen nur hart im Nehmen sein, entsprechend auch Dein pubertäres Aufplustern.

&gt; Denn es gibt keine Indizierung für FGM. Und auch dieser Vergleich ist eine infame Unterstellung.

Für die Frauen in Ghana ist die besprochene Form ebenso ein etablierter Bestandteil ihrer Kultur und des Körperbildes als für Religionsangehörige anderswo. Dass sie nicht erst auf Befehlsnotstand zur Begründung zurückfallen müssen ist bei der Betrachtung der physischen Auswirkungen irrelevant, ebenso wären sie von ""Ohne Religion dürft Ihr das nicht"" hellauf begeistert. (Weiter gilt auch hier: Was man amputiert, das kann nicht mehr erkranken. Schneid einen Hoden weg und Du reduzierst mögliches Krebsgewebe um 50 %, ganz ohne Funktionsverlust.)

&gt; Diese Befragungen über angebliche Einschränkungen des Sexuallebens, weil in der Haut angeblich die ganzen Nerven wären, sind mehr als dubios.

Niedlich. Wenn Dir deren Ergebnisse nicht passen, werden sie zu ""dubios"", ""angeblich"" und ""Halbwahrheiten"". So kann man sich das freilich zurecht leugnen, ist dann auch egal, dass diese Einschränkungen seit jeher auch von jüdischen Religionsgelehrten ausdrücklich angeführt wurden. Bleibt zu hoffen, dass im Nachspiel hierzulande weitere Forschung angeleitet wird, um weitere Klärung zu schaffen. Die hat man in den USA inmitten aller ""Vorteilssuche"" bisher außen vor gelassen.

&gt; Und das ist wichtig. Sehr wichtig. Manchmal braucht es eben ein Arschloch. Man muss die Dinge auch mal direkt aussprechen.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The problem is you can't say for sure what is true and morally good. For instance, a muslim thinks other things are true and morally good than a german.

Ethnicity is irrelevant. Frankly, I'm a little bit offended that you're saying that I'm supposed to believe certain things just because I or my parents were born in a certain country. Moral behavior is an offshoot of knowledge. People will behave better when you provide them with a good education and make sure that they learn how to think critically and rationally.

&gt;Immigration out of these countries means you are importing an inferior culture where women and gays are suppressed.

I think you mean ""oppressed"". In any event, everybody has to obey the law, regardless of where they're from. There are quite a few people in Germany who oppress homosexuals as well. Can we just throw them out, or are we stuck with those people just because they had the luck to be born here? Ignorance is a problem that isn't solved by putting people in other countries. You can only solve them by educating them.

Either we let immigrants in and provide their children with a good education, or we keep them out and make them send their kids to bad, biased faith schools in a dung heap of a country. 

What is better?

&gt;You can't combat this with education because kids will take most of their values from their parents.

This is insulting to me. I disagree with most of what my parents believe. 

&gt;Therefore germany needs to stay german and culture and tradition need to be cherished. 

Bullocks! This is exactly the mentality that stands in the way of human progress. Are you really telling me that something should be cherished just because our ancestors used to do it? Something is neither good nor true just because it's a tradition. Such a fallacy is called ""argumentum ad antiquitatem"". 

Besides, can you even tell me what  ""German"" is supposed to actually refer to? 

Are the clothes you're wearing German? Are the inventions you're using, the authors you're reading, or the music you listen to German? How pure does your blood have to be to be considered a real German? Are you familiar with Daniel Defoe's ""The True-Born Englishman""? You could write such a poem for German origins as well. I studied linguistics and even the language that is explicitly called ""German"", is just a melting pot of all kinds of languages. Most of the traditions you may be thinking of probably have their origin somewhere else as well. 

If we are honest, then we are just talking about arbitrary lines on a map and nothing more. Nothing of value is or should be confined by such arbitrary lines. 

&gt;Germany will need to stimulate remigration to combat these problems. 

What problems? A few louts beating their wifes? Why is it better when they beat their wifes in another country? Here, we send the police and the vermin is put in prison. Problem solved.

The high school football coach was a paid position and wasn't even a teacher. It was someone hired to JUST be the high school football coach. 

This kind of focus on sports made jocks the most popular kids in school and the biggest assholes. I was also involved in sports, running cross-country and playing field hockey.

A group of guys had paint thrown all over their uniforms as they walked off the field after the performance, because band was pussy compared to football... 

We had a weekly pep rally in the school gym for whatever sport was going on. We were literally FORCED to be involved with sports, whether we wanted to or not.

The language also has to be powerful enough to sound clever and precise enough to make business arrangements. Since whatever English speaking countries call ""accent free"" (that's BBC English in the UK, for example) is always very neutral and very easy to understand, English is probably the best way to go since native countries are easily to reach for the majority of the population and the dialect you'll most likely learn is understood well in other countries (and I mean the proper dialects like British English and American English. Of course you don't understand a lonely Welsh or Texan farmer if you're not used to the accent).

E dunque ci terremo la legge Calderoli in modo che i partiti non debbano allearsi prima del voto (disinnescando la querelle Casini-Vendola che di fronte al proprio elettorato devono stare ben separati) garantendo anche una certa presenza dei colonnelli orfani di un PDL scoppiato.

Any communication in the function of a public servant/employee could and should be considered as tolerated and/or sanctioned by the entity that person works for.

If I saw a policeman on the job openly displaying affinity to say the NPD (neonazi party of Germany) I am going to assume that this is sanctioned or at least tolerated by the state. The NPD is part of an ideology which historically has been associated with terror and severely restricting freedom, so this would rightly fill me with worry or at least uncertainty. 

So while I would fully support this policeman's right to express his views as an invidual, I can see how displaying a mindset devoted to restricting freedom causes confusion and unrest. And I am happy to hear that there was an investigation - I would find it more troubling if citizen reports or possible misconduct of police officers were left ignored.

Words have meaning. We can communicate ideas, feelings, nearly everything with words. Words can be constructed into phrases of deeper meaning. When used in the wrong context, it can hurt. It can be harnessed into a collective belief of bigotry among others and those people with those beliefs can physically hurt other people.

After all, humans are generally social animals and need communication to understand each other.

Radical Christians are responsible for their own blasphemous crimes in the name of the Lord for thousands of years, as much as Islam. To this day, there are plenty of Christians who think they're doing the right thing by going to other countries and committing ethnocide. In the US, extremists Christians believe in withholding birth control contraceptives and abolishing abortion even for rape because they value an unborn fetus, or potential fetus, over a woman. They've committed violence against women, blacks, and gays, all to which they assume as lesser than the ideological straight, white Christian man. 

But not all Christianity is bad. It's just how one practices it. Christianity offers a set of morals and ethics that many people can follow, just like Islam. There is, however, a difference in radical Islam than there is in Islam.

It's annoying since there is a better healthcare, education (literacy rates are considerably higher), people earn more and live more. And people still fantasize from a time where you couldn't speak your mind with fear of who was listening. 

Because we had people coming back with nothing from the colonies and in the 90s we had a surge of Brazilian emigrants, people started blaming races and nationalities. The returnees had no education and assumed they were going to have it big. The Brazilian people expecting great wages started doing jobs Portuguese people didn't want to do, for less. Here comes the leaches. When Portugal entered the EU or whatever it was called at the time. We had a leftish government that said the money would be used to improve Portuguese way of life. The money was spent in roads, partnerships with private companies where they had no risk, the infamous PPP (Public Private Partnerships) and 20 years later, we're still paying them. We have 3 roads to go from Lisbon to Oporto. 3!! We haven't been in a crisis since 2007, we're in crisis since the 1920s. It was then that some large corporations or named families started infecting the economy and haven't let go since.

true,Asyx,NRWW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"You can't really tell how the difference actually is until Bachelor and Master degrees are more wide spread. It's been 2 years since universities are not allowed to offer Diplomstudiengänge anymore. Those were very different on a FH and university. 

The Bachelor on a FH is more focused on practical experience (little example in CS: I have to do a Analysis 1 and Lineare Algebra 1 module in my first semester and 2 out of Analysis 2, Lineare Algebra 2 and Statistik while university student have to do mathematics with actual mathematics students for a longer time. That math is useless in the industry) and you have to pass a business class and developing soft skills and practical units next to theoretical lessons and stuff like that. 

There were plenty of newspaper articles in the last couple of years that talked about FH and university degrees and mostly the FH student got more initial salary. The master is more research orientated and pretty much the same as on a university.

What basically happened is that FH and university are not two separate institutions anymore but rather the same thing with different goals. Before Bachelor and Master degrees, the FH was something a lot lower than a university and it was hard work to get from a FH to a university. Today, they will probably take a closer look at you if you apply on a university but that's about it. Especially since most FHs work close with universities.

What about my opinion is ""moronic""? I'm observing a basic trait about the effects of a religion. Would I be ""moronic"" if I said that Catholics tend to like the Pope? Or that Mormons tend to dislike alcohol? Or that Hindus generally don't order steak? 

Islam is actively resisting reformation now, a trait built into its DNA as a religion. It will continue to resist modernization, passively when it can and violently when it can't. 

Attempting to construe my disgust with a religion as racism is also a shady tactic, by the way. Religion is not an in-born trait. Children are not born religious. Religion is something someone chooses to follow. Society should take active steps to discourage and prevent people from adopting a hateful, violent religion.

Don't allow them to fill official positions, or forbid their parties altogether. Prosecute the use of Nazi symbols and speech glorifying Nazism. Hold counterdemonstrations wherever they gather. If Nazis plan to organize conferences, pressure the venue owners to refuse them. Do not allow public gatherings at symbolic Nazi places (graves of notorious Nazis, etc). Boycott Nazi-owned and Nazi-friendly shops. Lobby concert venues to not host any concerts by Nazi bands, and demonstrate if they do.

Not the 4 or 5 that did things like Schindler and The White Rose movement) are honoured in the area where they've done something. A few minutes from my house is a little memorial with names on it. I suppose it's a Ww2 memorial. As far as I know, there is a memorial for 10 people who managed to get out of the city at night and tell the American troops that the population is not going to fight back. The Americans kept the one who manage to get to them to get him escorting the Americans and they didn't had to fight there way through the city. As far as I know, the Nazis executed the members of that group they could catch and left the city. If I remember correctly, nobody died when the Americans entered the city. There is actually a Wikipedia article about that operation. 

So, the problem is that you don't know who was a Nazi and who wasn't. So they honour the deaths in their hometown or make small memorials for people that did good stuff during the war. We also value education about that topic. There are documentaries that showed what the nazis have done to (for example) teenage girls (they forced them to control the artillery and if they duck because of flying shrapnels, they got shot because cowardliness in front of the enemy was unacceptable) so people know that not everybody joined the Wehrmacht volounterially.

We can start resolving the problem by first dropping the dehumanizing talk. Most of the social integration issues stem from communication. *They* distrust *us*, *they* fear *us*, *they* hate *us*. Romanies are used to being murdered, beaten, sterilized, hated, etc. They are constantly in survival mode. Of course they wouldn't want to integrate in *your* society when you only have hate for them.

&gt;The four polling stations located near the riot police station MAT, used by the police, recorded percentages of between 13 and 19. [...] Based on the electoral lists, 550 to 700 people voted at each of these voting stations, of which 20 to 30 per cent were police officers. 
The newspaper then calculated that 45 to 59 per cent of police officers voted for Golden Dawn.

A figure calculated solely on the hypothesis that all the votes for golden dawn were *all* votes by police, only then it would add up to 45 to 59 percent.

This hardly constitutes evidence for the whole Greek police force. Nor is it representative: I imagine riot stations tend to house a rather specific kind of cop.

Another thing that makes me very suspicious, is that the elections in Greece are on Sundays and votes are usually cast where you live, not where you work.

Considering that it is in the interest of the news agencies to sell news, it seems all to likely they take one badly calculated figure and run with it.

As for wikipedia, it clearly states that police is alleged to be working with golden dawn. With again only circumstantial evidence to show for it.

While I am perfectly willing to believe that the Greek police is quite a bit more to the right than the general populace, to say that half of them is extreme right is too simplistic. What I do believe however, is that the police feels no obligation whatsoever to protect immigrants from the violence of those extremists. Which, in itself is bad enough.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"I never said that doesn't happen. But what are you saying? Does that justify the racist and aggressive attitude of some Arabs?

Anyway, bear with me, I have a little story.

I have a close relative in the French army. To join he had to pass a few days at the recruiting center. They were around 40 candidates there, around 30 of whom were your typical ""racaille"", mostly of Arab descent, whom I guess had nothing better to do (that's why they were the majority). They had absolutely no discipline. They'd walk around with their hands in their pockets, ""trainant les pieds"", and unable to stand straight, and would answer rudely to the officers... Needless to say, none of them was recruited and eventually, 8 people of the 40 candidates were finally recruited, 6 whites, 1 black from Martinique, and one redeeming Arab. Now if some of them can't even understand that for the fucking army one needs to be disciplined, it's easy to see why they may have difficulties finding jobs in the civilian sector too.

A friend of mine is in human resources for a phone service company. Basically, he's not recruiting the sharpest tools in the shed, yet he still has difficulties recruiting in these groups. Many of these Arab kids are simply not recruitable. They are aggressive, and have no motivation and can't say a sentence properly. And he wanted to recruit minorities, because, contrary to popular belief, companies want to show how open they are to diversity. In the end, it were minority women who were often recruited, because many men were just not job material, and they put themselves in this situation.

Also, this is important : you know about the anonymous CVs incentive in France? Hiding the candidate's name and photo from the recruiter, so as to avoid discrimination? Guess what? It produced the opposite result. What happens is that recruiters who see that a candidate is a minority will be more generous and understanding if his credentials and spelling suck. When the CVs are anonymous, the recruiter will discard those with spelling errors, and that favorises the native French who make fewer errors. Here's an article about this interesting phenomena which destroys all the cliches : http://www.capital.fr/carriere-management/actualites/le-cv-anonyme-favorise-les-discriminations-588879

Now I'm not saying there aren't any real discriminations, but I am saying that the rioters, the mugging scumbag ""racailles"" have never really tried. Those who try can get a job and a decent living.

They especially like talking about American politics, and not always in the nicest way - Germany is very left-leaning by American standards. I'm bemused that an American friend of mine who's conservative (yet doesn't follow politics) wants to move too.

So, first off all, politics over here is truly a more smalltalk-topic. I you like on of the the big politics ideads more does not generally result in hatred from the others. While we can have strong opinions, having to oppiste opinion does not outcast you like in some US-circles.

However in smalltalk we keep it general, and when we talk about US-politics, from a german stance, it is like talking about a conservative party and anouther far more rightwing side that would be linked to Nazis if it was german. So, no harm to be caused, german conservatives like Obama too.

Yeah, we pity you while hating that system. If you are smart enough to earn a higher education degree you should be rewareded and not punished.

&gt; 3) Someone needs to elaborate on this one, but my understanding is that while Germans have a kind of universal healthcare, there's a quarterly premium you have to pay. I'm probably getting this wrong, but that's what I remember.

Well that quartly premium only applies if you actually visit a doctor. And if you do it counts for all Doctor/medical visits you do that quarter. Oh, and by the way it is ~13$, once a quarter.

Algerians, or immigrants in general, didn't ""rebuild"" France after WWII. That's a common misconception. Immigrants represented less than 3% of the workforce in 1950. I have sources to back this up if you want. Saying that they rebuilt France is an insult to intelligence. Also, I have sources proving that the importing of Algerians to France was France being nice - trying to help Algeria from its famine and to help Algerians feel French. The state had to force French industries to take in Algerian workers, because otherwise they were considered inferior factory workers compared to French working class, or other European workers like Poles or Spanish. They had inferior productivity - surely because they weren't used to industrialized work. Otherwise, Algerians were officially French. That's pretty nice and nondiscriminatory when you think about it. Unlike the MANY vietnamese immigrants who moved to France, yet the vietnamese didn't cause the least bit of problem.

- Usually, not many people speak english.
- Be careful during night(but this is a common World thing, isnt it?) Usually nothing bad should happen but..when it happens..argh.
- Patriotism. Yeah, sometimes people can be mean to other nationalities. I cannot say it is Racism, but still..
Well, students usually are open minded, so i can be 100% sure you wont have any problem.
