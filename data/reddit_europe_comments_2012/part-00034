* None of the ISPs have transfer limits. And P2P is (still) legal in Spain, so no problem at all with TPB. The most popular connection nowadays is ADSL 10MB download / 800kbps upload. The prices range from ~60€ (with [Telefonica](http://www.movistar.es/), but they usually have special offers so it can end up being 40€) to ~30€ per month. The top companies are [Jazztel](http://www.jazztel.com/), [Vodafone](http://www.vodafone.es/), [Ya.com](http://www.ya.com/). In Valencia there is also [ONO](http://www.ono.es/) (a cable provider) that will offer you higher download/upload rates within the same price range. There is no need to pay for television if you don't want it.

* The cheapest supermarkets are [Mercadona](https://www.mercadona.es/ns/index.php), [LIDL](http://www.lidl.es) and [Aldi](http://www.aldi.es). Mercadona has an online shop for all their products (for delivery) son you can check all the prices there. You'll need a fake Spanish ID number (just 8 random numbers plus a checksum letter, generator [here](http://www.pagaelpato.com/tecno/dni.htm)). As for ZIP code use 46001 (Valencia city center). Chicken breasts /  pork loin can run for ~6€/kilo, 1kg spaghetti for ~0.80€, 500g tomato puree can for ~0,40€, Coca-Cola 2L ~1,50€. You can buy 400g sliced Gouda cheese for ~2.50€ in Aldi, or a frozen pizza for ~1.50€.
* LIDL and Aldi have a very limited assortment and won't carry the popular brands, but they are the absolute cheapest. You can live a whole month on 50€ buying there.
* In Spain universities do not usually provide student lodging. They just have a small residence with less than 100 rooms, only for special cases. If you are going to live into these, I have no idea of the price, but they usualy have internet included, through the University's own network. This means that if they see/notice an unusual amount of bandwith usage they can limit your connection or disconnect you for good.
* Regular student apartments (just regular rental apartments, with students living there) prices depend on the number of roommates and the location. Small room, old building, 3-4 roommates can go for ~80-100€/month. The same in a new building, excellent location, up to ~250€. In these cases the first student that got the apartment usually hires internet connection and it's paid on top of the rent.",0,1332749234,null,0,true,0,c4511rq,t3_rdu9w,t1_c4511rq,t3_rdu9w,null,1428595343,7,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,7

Gender nonconforming children frequently grow up to identity as cisgender gay adults. Some believe, like Dr Ken Zucker in Toronto (hardly an uncontroversial figure), that this means that while in childhood, the developmental path of the child is somewhat malleable and the child might be redirected from believing they are the opposite sex, and be made to feel comfortable with it. But even Zucker does not espouse the completely absurd view that children as old as 11 or 12 can be forced to accept being the opposite sex if their strongly expressed need to transition or prevent pubertal changes is persistent, and he routinely recommends puberty blocking drugs in such cases.

I like 8rax idea about having lunck in a park. The best fromagerie (cheese shop) in Paris IMO is Quatrehomme (a little expensive).
For meat go to a authentic charcuterie and you will find some amazing pâté and other really good stuff.
Don't forget to get some baguette in a boulangerie, there is a lot of good bakeries so try to find one, even tough near the Eiffel tower it can be more expensive than other districts.

Should military service be mandatory for both men and women in Finland. I'm not sure. I think that considering physical differences between men and women *in general*, this voluntary system might be a good solution, when thinking about the training and what is expected.

Why then all men are forced to serve... Well, that has of course historical background (it is assumed that every man has to serve country and fight for the freedom, as was the case in our previous wars). So, making the military service mandatory for men, it guarantees that there are freshly trained men available at any given time. I guess that the fear is that if the military service was optional also for men, there would not be enough people volunteering.

There is also another option for men, the civil service, for those that do not want to go through the military service (or if you are a pacifist and do not want to do either, you go to jail).

The thing with welfare is that all of the money the government is spending on those lower income classes eventually ends up back into the economy, it is the best way of economic stimulus.

""Grazie per **la tua** risposta"".

Risposta is female, and you need to match the gender for both the article and the pronoun. We always do this.

""suggestione"". The right word is ""suggerimento"". Suggestione refers to a magic illusion, but it's seldom used.

""Voglio guardare **dei** film"".

""alcuni film mi trovo"". I assume you wanted to say ""li trovo"". ""li"" is an implicit pronoun we use in that context.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"The WTO has some rules about what is acceptable in global trade, in terms of tariffs, subsidies and so on, and it decides on measures that countries/blocks can take against each other if one of them is in violation. This is different from [free trade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade), where there are no tariffs.

The EU has a [common market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_market), which again is much more than just free trade, and is [working towards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Market_(European_Union\)) a true single market. Companies within this market are subject to the same regulations, e.g., in regards to product safety or consumer rights, they can do business in all member countries (that's why all those former state monopolies had to be broken up), and borders effectively become meaningless as far as business regulations are concerned.  
For example, if you found a company, you can already choose between any of the legal forms that are available in the EU, somebody from France could found a German-style GmbH in the UK.

That's why the EU needs governance, whereas our free trade agreement with South Korea does not. The latter just means that importers don't have to pay duties when they import Samsung phones or Deawoo cars, but not all South Korean products can be imported if they don't meet EU regulations e.g., for recycling quotas or health regulations for ingredients in cosmetics. When things like privacy regulations for websites are decided on the EU level, then that's because a German company might host its website in France and subcontract management of payments to a British company.  
That's also why those EFTA countries still are subject to EU regulations -- they're part of the common market, it's not just free trade.

Those are very different beasts. I believe that the whole EU membership discussion in the UK would be very different if people would better understand the difference between free trade and a common market. A common market is so much more than just free trade, and it needs common laws and regulations, and they have to be decided somehow. Many even seem to believe that EFTA has access to it without being subject to Brussels' rule.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Let's say the UK would leave the EU for a mere free trade agreement and take a car manufacturer as an example.

It's a good car that should meet all safety regulations. But does it? So far, it only went through crash tests in the UK. If you now want to export it to the EU, you'd have to demonstrate that it would meet those as well. The British requirements and methods for testing could be exactly the same, but unless there was a specific bilateral agreement, there would be no way of knowing it. There also are EU regulations about recycling of materials after the car goes onto the junk yard. Within the EU, manufacturers are responsible for that, but again, unless there was a specific bilateral agreement, the importer would be held responsible. Same for environmental regulations. Everything would have to be certified twice, or there would have to be a bilateral agreement that made sure regulations are the same and mutually recognizes certificates. Now do that for each and every kind of product or service.

Take EU data privacy regulations. Companies in the EU can outsource handling of data to companies in the US if they adhere to the Free Haven agreement that the EU has negotiated with the US. For that British payment provider above, this means that the UK would have to negotiate a similar agreement with the EU. And if you wanted to have the same kind of protection for your own consumers, you'd have to negotiate such an agreement with the Americans as well, once they find room for those negotiations in their busy schedule.

The UK has decided that being a member of the single market is beneficial because it didn't really get anywhere within the EFTA that it cofounded. You already had that, but observed how the EC managed to grow much more quickly. Italy had wanted the regional development funds much earlier, but ultimately it was the UK that helped to push them through, there was quite a gap between Ireland, the UK (and Italy) and the other EC members.

Another reason why we need to work towards a common market instead of a mere free trade area is that there simply are policies we all want, but can't enact without putting our own industries at a disadvantage. Take environmental regulations, for example. If only one of the members enacted limits on emissions, manufacturers would simply move to a neighboring country. That's essentially what the financial transaction tax discussion was about. Most countries took the position that something like this was desirable, but only on a global scale.  
Something related is the EU's planned taxes on emissions for air traffic. Just look at the frictions with the US and China about that. Imagine the UK trying to pull something like this off on its own. It's difficult enough as it is, and the EU is the largest single market in the world. On a smaller scale, like the recent ban on keeping chicken in cage batteries, it works quite well, and when the EU bans an ingredient for cosmetics, manufacturers tend to remove it globally instead of passing up on sales. They wouldn't lose a lot of revenue if they couldn't sell to the UK.",0,1332832528,null,0,true,0,c45ebva,t3_rdz38,t1_c45ebva,t1_c45e0k6,null,1428601641,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The city of Tallinn is run by a single party, Keskerakond (Centre party). This party used to be huge, but over the years it's lost much of its popularity because of massive corruption, shady co-operation with United Russia and completely insane political rhetoric. They are in the parliament opposition and every party has ruled out co-operating them as long as their current leader (Edgar Savisaar) is still in charge.

So why does this party hold the all-important capital? It's because their #1 support group is Russians, Tallinn has lots of them and unlike parliament elections, local elections allow non-citizens to vote. 

The fuhrer of the party, the mayor of Tallinn, has lost all credibility among Estonian voters and is trying to:
a) use as many idiotic money-wasting populist tricks as possible to keep his last seat until he finally dies of another heart attack or
b) make it really hard for anyone who might take his chair from him, because they would have to balance the budget, repeal this and many other stupid money wasters and somehow still remain popular.

This is not a green move, nor a progressive one. This is taken straight out of the Soviet Union's history book, a cheap political play so that a sad old man could still old hold on to his last straw of political power. The whole ""public poll"" was a complete farce, just syphoning €260000 out from the city's coffers.

Forcing? There is no forcing in giving a gift and putting conditions to it. And the reason is that on the whole even broken families are better than single mom + serial boyfriends because at least a bad father is a better role model than the gangsters out on the street - the people in the ghettoes become gangsters usually because they have no father as a role model. So this is why.

&gt;That is just... a little bit racist.

Well a proper conservative IMHO does not fear looking a bit racist as we know this word is almost always just a verbal bludgeon to silence debate. But generally I mentioned white chavs too.

&gt;The thing with welfare is that all of the money the government is spending on those lower income classes eventually ends up back into the economy, it is the best way of economic stimulus. What is a poor man going to buy? Clothes, food, pay his rent, and that money re-enters the economy and is taxed.

This is too Keynesian thinking. The point is, too much consumption is not good in every sane, read, non-Keynesian school of econ. Why? Because if you spend money on consumer goods you don't spend money on investment goods. You just eat the future. The point is, making spoons and making spoon-making machines both stimulates the economy but the later is more useful.

&gt;Calling social security a Ponzi scheme is a bit off

Really? It depends on enough young people being born, getting educated, having good jobs and paying enough social security. It depends on how many people pay in later on. IMHO there is a similarity.

&gt;...Anbieter von E-Mail-Diensten mit mehr als 10.000 Nutzerkonten verpflichtet, eine Schnittstelle „zur Ausleitung von E-Mails für Bedarfsträger“ zur Verfügung zu stellen.

Das ist interessant, wenn ich nur mal einen kleiner lokalen Mailanbieter finden würde. Den letzten den ich kannte hat vor 10 Jahren zugemacht.

Ja klar, die haben eine verschlüsselte Verbindung, und wenn der Bürger das macht gerät er direkt ins Raster.
Wozu eigentlich, damit keiner den BND abhört?

&gt;Diese Genehmigung ist erforderlich, weil das Postgeheimnis aus Artikel 10 des Grundgesetzes auch private E-Mails schützt.

Was bringt das Postgeheimnis wenn es einfach ausgehebelt wird durch eine ""Genehmigung""? Das ist wie das ausgehöhlte Bankgeheimnis nicht das Papier wert auf dem es steht. Wir stehen alle unter Generalverdacht. Das ist die Umkehrung des Unschuldsprinzips. Schade, das das keinen unserer Volksvertreter interessiert. (ok, ausser den Schar und Ströbele)

&gt;Nur der BND filtert E-Mails – behauptet jedenfalls ein Verfassungsschützer. 

In dem Fall hätte man BND auch durch Weihnachtsmann ersetzen können. Die 37mio Daten müssen ja irgendwo aus- und vor allem verwertet werden. Filtern wird der BND vielleicht nur aber auswerten und nutzen werden sie Diese alle.

2. Don't hang around with the other Americans. Most of them are giant chodes, and you didn't come to another foreign country to hang out with your compatriots. 
3. Try to fit in sartorially. This means leaving your baggy jeans, Nike trainers, and your college fraternity sweatshirt at home.
4. 100 Montaditos is a godsend if you don't have much money. Get the tablas for 6€ and on Wednesday, everything is 1€. 
5. If you're responsible for finding your own housing, [Idealista](http://www.idealista.com) is by far the best website. [Loquo](http://www.loquo.es) is used as well, but has no filtering or sorting options.
6. If you're planning on travelling within Spain, use the cheap bus system or the budget airlines. Trains are decent, but overpriced. If you take the intercity buses, always reserve the very last seat on the aisle. The seats fill up sequentially and the last seat is always the last one to be taken, so you'll nearly always have a free seat next to you.

La différence réside dans le rapport des religions au pouvoir politique. La sécularisation des sociétés occidentales a repoussé (de façon plus ou moins violente) le christianisme en dehors de la sphère politique et lui a ôté de cette façon l'essentiel de son pouvoir de nuisance.

Cette forme de transition, l'islam (dans son ensemble) ne l'a pas accompli et c'est pourquoi cette religion sert de terreau fertile aux extrémistes et terroristes de tout bord.

Instead of trying to pigeonhole the world into artificial categories like ""xenophobia"", ""mysogyny"" try to understand the conservative worldview. Liberals come from theory to reality, they define words like ""xenophobia"" and any description of reality that can be pigeonholed into it is automatically bad. The conservative view is rooted in reality, in experience, if you see a problem you can't just shut up about it just because it sounds offensive - although it is preferable to approach it in a tactful way if possible. Which I try to. Doesn't always manage to, sometimes ones is angry that the arguments of his side are not even heard. But some generalizations are sometimes necessary for the sake of succintness, you can't just always write a full book about everything. And calling anything any kind of feminist could possibly interpret as offensive ""misogynist"" means basically not even listening to the argument, just trying to suppress it.

At any rate, I think your trauma-oriented worldview lacks some necessary details. Certain traumas lead to certain kinds of psychological problems leading to certain kinds of crimes, but that specific kind of unruly living, drugs, alcohol, women-as-bitches, and career-criminal-gangster kind of thing so typical in gypsy ghettos and some other subcultures for example is a direct result of not having a father role model who shows how to treat a woman, how to work, how to be a normal man.

Even an attempt by the then-SPD leader in the state of Hesse a few years ago to govern with 'toleration' by the Left (ie not even a formal coalition) led to a rebellion by the right of the SPD and the fall of said party leader.

The reasons for the deep animosity towards the Left among many leading SPDers are at least threefold:

* The Left's leader, Oskar Lafontaine, was once the SPD leader, and is widely resented as something of a traitor for leaving the party and then fiercely attacking it from the outside. 

* The Left party was a merger of a trade unionist party and the party of the former East-German communists, and the latter still makes the party poison to even many left-wingers - the weight of history. 

* Finally, the Left Party's economic populism and protest politics, especially in the Western states and on a national level, is considered to make the party unfit for government by many SPD moderates and pragmatists. (I don't agree, myself - just explaining that they think so.)

I work for a German research institute and I'm a scientist. Throughout my studies in UK we always had Southern European students who are extremely talented (and I don't say that lightly). In these places the education is very good but the jobs aren't there. Argentina is another example of an educated people with less jobs for highly skilled. 


Even now throughout research institutes in Europe there are Spanish, Greeks etc. doing the work. In my opinion Germans don't necessarily make good scientists and many are lazy, too entitled. 


I have a feeling such attitudes are being reinforced in German culture lately also which shocks me. The real loss of this EU mess is that soon there won't be Spanish, Greek, Italian students pushing our research. Because they will never study but hang around with their junky mates from broken homes in 20 years time. This is the real cost. You can think about markets all you want but people have more value than any amount of money.

This is sometimes done for several consonants in a row after an r — Hornstull is pronounced [huːɳʂ'ʈɵlː]).

Go online &amp; order your states documents. To get an Apostille you must send in the document with appropriate cover letter to the appropriate Secretary of State with the $ amount &amp; country of intent (noted on their website) and a SASE. 

Paternal being your father. So you must get your mother &amp; father's birth &amp; marriage(primary) then divorce and/or death (if applicable) certificates. Then get all Apostille....follow this process all the way back to the last Italian citizens. Here is the hitch: The parents, who were last Italian citizens, must NOT have renounced their Italian citizenship AND must NOT have (if applicable) become American citizens BEFORE their child (your grandparent) was born.

You must get the documentation from Italy for the last family member who was a citizen which can be difficult if you do not have a family contact point. Their are agency's that do this sort of thing but I am unsure since I did not need it.

Some of the documents will need to be translated into Italian and you will need a professional translator to do that.

I am getting all documentation done in duplicate so there will be no issues. Locating your Italian Embassy will be of help, their website should shed some light on any additional information needed. *The embassy is your first learning experience on Italian Bureaucracy. I had a family friend deal with them in Italian and INSIST upon physical paperwork work. The lady said it was on the website. This went in circles for several minutes before she went into the back and got paperwork that was NOT on the website when we checked later on. Having a legit contact to help with Embassy transactions &amp; in Italy to help you obtain documentation (I sent out several e-mails that all went unanswered before I contacted my cousin for help) is 110% of the battle. Be prepared and determined*

If you want to mix with different people than the ones you are coming here with, you have mainly two options (from my point of view):
- Aim at other foreign students, from different origins. Forming a group of exchange students with people from different countries is easier than joining a lcoal group.
- Find an excuse to connect. If you play chess at home, go to a chess tournament. If you grow bonsai, join the local bonsai club. Although catalans spend a lot of time in bars, that's not the best place to make friends.

true,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"I have some experience with both as well (but am originally an American), and I think they vary in fairly complex ways. One thing that I prefer about southern European work culture is that they're much more flexible on work hours. During downtimes they might work sporadically and come into the office at noon, but in crunch times, small businesses in particular will have everyone in the office until midnight all week before a deadline, to make sure things are working, and will be willing to get on the phone at 2am to people in other parts of the world. The owner or CEO himself will be there at midnight if it's needed. Lots of flexibility when necessary, at least if it's a smaller business that you have a good relationship with.

In Scandinavia I find much less flexibility. People will show up every week for their 37 hours, and that's that. They do good work in the 37 hours, but has to be very planned, with employees rarely feeling any sense of urgency. That's good in some ways, but I find it hard to generalize that northern Europeans are ""harder-working"" than Southern Europeans as a result.

&gt; Sure we can. All crime should be investigated and punished. Even if the victims are mostly women and children.

Especially when they are children I'd think, but you can't still be seriously thinking that prostitution is something you can actually stop, do you? Crimes can be investigated, but the authorities have to know about it first. Prostitution, like drugs, is of such a nature that no matter what you do most of it is always going to fall through the cracks and keep to the underground, where the police won't know. For every sex ring like in OP that gets caught a dozen go unnoticed.

&gt; it? You mean sex? Really? Well, if it is societal pressure that makes men buy sex from women and children we should try to, somehow, take that pressure off men, don't you think?

Sure, you get right on that. ;)

&gt;The laws are meant to protect victims of violence and trafficking, both women and men. I'm not sure what the laws on prostitution are like in Sweden but in Iceland selling sex is not illegal, pimping is and buying sex also.

They are that way in Sweden too. It's a lot better than say the US where the victims are also being punished for the crime. But even so like I said the law can't be everywhere, and most of the sex trade is still going to be around even if you ban it. It will just be underground, where you have no control or oversight of it.

By allowing a legal, well regulated and strictly controlled (and taxed) market you can effectively destroy the whole underground sex trade. Why go to a pimp on a street corner or at a suspicious brothel when the state runs a much safer and better brothel right next door? The prostitutes would be much better off that way. They'd get proper employment with collective agreements and union protection, regular health checks, mandatory protection, a guarded environment in which to do business, etc. Meanwhile the costumers also get better and safer service, regular consumer protection and price setting, and all those other things that a legal market can provide which an illegal one won't.

Like I said: harm reduction, rather than deterring, is what we should be focusing on. When something is illegal it doesn't go away, it just goes out of sight and becomes a lot worse for those that are affected by it.

(About the women-men issue in Sweden at least the whole ""debate"", in as much as it exists, is about how women must be protected and how women are the victims. Anti-prostitution laws are somewhat paradoxically I think a major feminist issue (because, you know, more restrictions on what consenting women can and can't do with their own bodies is just such a feminist policy!), with no justification whatsoever about how the laws also apply to men. To be fair though it's just as illegal for a woman to pay for sex as it is for a man, so there's always that.)",0,1332872676,null,0,false,0,c45jm5y,t3_reifc,t1_c45jm5y,t1_c45jfe9,null,1428604288,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;you can't still be seriously thinking that prostitution is something you can actually stop, do you?  

I have never implied that I thought it could be stopped. I have no problem with people willingly charging for access to their bodies. Abuse and trafficking I do have a problem with.  Ignoring it just because most victims are women and children is horrible.  



&gt;Sure, you get right on that. ;)  

Well, I don't know what your preferences are but if you ever find yourself in my neck of the woods give me a shout and I'll give a kick in balls for free ;)  



&gt;the law can't be everywhere, and most of the sex trade is still going to be around even if you ban it.  


So we should just ignore it, you mean?  We could do that. And do, for the most part. Let the police tend to more important crimes. Most trafficked people in Europe are from Asia and Eastern Europe anyway, hardly people to bother the police about, right?

And the thing I'm trying to say is that by legalising and regulating the prostitution market it becomes a lot easier to stop the sex trade and to make sure that everyone involved are consenting to it. I'm not saying we should ignore it (that was never my point!), I'm saying that the current situation (in the Nordic countries at least) does more harm than good.

Well, that won't address our overaching societal problem with sex fixation now will it? Unless you mean to say you'd want to kick everyone in the balls/uterus, in which case I'd say that's a waste of taxpayer resources.

&gt; So we should just ignore it, you mean? We could do that. And do, for the most part. Let the police tend to more important crimes. Most trafficked people in Europe are from Asia and Eastern Europe anyway, hardly people to bother the police about, right?

That's not at all what I'm saying. I'm saying that in a legal market you *can* stop sex slavery, whereas in an illegal one you can't. I don't know why you think I'm being racist or whatever, since I've never said anything of the sort. I've been arguing this whole time about how a legal market will ensure that prostitutes work in good conditions and never against their will, rather than an illegal market where sex slavery is always going to happen.

Yes. I was very explicit about that. I want a state monopoly on prostitution.

true,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"Argh. It's not about a difference in softness of material, but density. The thickness of the non-holes in the bread. You don't change that by putting it into the fridge.

As Germany has many, many, many non-pure wheat breads, and only wheat comes with enough gluten to support the fine structures that support fluffyness, it's more dense by default.

Try to spread German Nutella on a [Hefezopf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hefekranz) and you'll have the same problem. And something that's way too sweet.

German bread belongs in the oven, optimally in a slightly air-permeable (think unglazed earthenware) container in the oven, btw. Fridges are too humid. You can also freeze it as slices so it's durable for more than its usual 2-4 weeks (uncut) and unfreeze it in a toaster. Unfreezing it at room temperature works, but can result in non-optimal distribution of too much water, *much like committing the atrocity of storing it in the fridge* and toasting is faster and more tasty, anyway. 

Also, compared to German breadrolls, the fluffyness of baguettes is abysmal. The only reason they're (slightly) more durable (max. 14 hours or so before you have to re-bake them, which works fine *once*: re-baking the rolls you bought Saturday morning Sunday morning is fine, avoid everything else like the plague) is that their crust is thicker.

You can try what you want and I respect the French cuisine deeply and it's the world leader in many, many things but it doesn't even come close to German cuisine when it comes to bread, sausage and beer.

Many MEPs - even many of those against ACTA - saw the potential referral as a legitimate legally and perhaps even a good thing if (if) the ECJ ruled against the Commission position. 

But you're right, it is a manoeuvre by the Commission in this instance. When ACTA was less politicised the Commission were against. Now that it is incredibly politicised they want a nice five month (or more) wait in which interest can be cooled, debate stopped, and the argument won through attrition. I think it should be clear even to those that were previously arguing for ECJ referral that the time to defeat ACTA in the EP is now, with the AVAAZ petition declared admissable last week and interest near its peak.

I love you so much for this.

That's very interesting, thanks - I'm not too up on Austrian politics, but I did pretty strongly get the idea that it's a fairly restrictive club, full of the usual suspects on a national level.

&gt; but I find the idea that they didn't write their own thesis at all equally disturbing.

Just for argument's sake, this is what I see as the flip-side to the disavowal of the sort of anti-intellectualism that you see in large segments of the American electorate.

In many European countries, the pressure is on for higher academic degrees, and especially in Germany and Austria, there's still a huge premium placed on PhDs and their equivalent even if they say very little about a person's political competence (it's not _so_ much the case in Switzerland, but then we're a bunch of bumpkin farm idiots anyway :D)  So there's a far higher pressure for people to cheat, and at the same time, far more motivation for the press to tear them down for it.

And that, in turn, cheapens higher degrees by tainting them with the implicit suspicion that plagiarism might have been involved.

It's sort of similar in France, where the Grandes Écoles (in my opinion) are the single greatest contributing factor to the economic and political stagnation that unfortunately characterizes that great country.  One of the reasons Sarkozy was such a breath of fresh air (before he squandered it by turning out to be an arrogant muppet and tolerating huge corruption, as well as acting like a little king, typical of most French Presidents) was that he was not a product of ENA unlike most of the country's political elite.  The schools, despite being unarguably of high caliber, tend to attract a self-selecting crowd, which reduces the amount of fresh blood and equality in the higher reaches of politics and corporate structures.  There's far too much focus on academic qualifications, thus increasing the motivation to game the system.

In this regard, I kind of like the American approach to academia - rather than incorporating a ""Dr."" as someone's legal name, as the Germans do, it's seen as a bit gauche and pretentious if someone who's not either an actual medical doctor, or who hasn't distinguished himself in his field (e.g. Neil de Grasse Tyson), refers to himself as ""Doctor so-and-so"".",0,1332935211,null,0,false,0,c45tr51,t3_rgd4b,t1_c45tr51,t1_c45tn2l,null,1428609374,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

If certain problems like tax evasion are not resolved, I can clearly understand why some european citizens are against bailing out Greece.
Changing the administrative and tax system is one very important issue and even if it can not fix the greek economy, it sends a message that Greece wants to change and that is an important step to earn trust and a bailout package which can help the greek economy to it's feet. I am all for another bailout packag for the regional economies and not the banks, but reading comments like yours make me doubt if Greece even wants to change ...

And by the way not mutinational corportions earn most of the GDP in economically strong countries. It's small/medium sized enterprises that are managed well, which do the lion share for the german economy.

Edit: For your claims that Greece can never be as competitive as Germany, [here is a graph comparing the growth rates](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=gdp+growth+germany+greece). As it turns out, for most of the 90s and 2000s, Greece had more growth than Germany had. So please don't tell me that the Greek people have the intrinsic disability to perform economically.
