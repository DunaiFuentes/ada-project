Let's look at Gas prices per gallon (in USD):

Australia: $5.68
EU Average: $7.76
USA: $3.90

An extra $1/gallon tax on gas would make the overall tax system less progressive, even if top rates were increased from the current 35% to 40% in tandem. That's not to say it shouldn't be done. Its just I want people to realize social welfare spending doesn't come free of cost to the low &amp; middle classes. Especially in America where consumers are so used to higher consumption levels than their European peers.

And even looking at your example: Taxes are way lower here on people making $80-180k. In the US, you don't hit the 35% bracket until ~388,000 in income. Let's say they make it so income over 180k starts paying 35%, that makes it more regressive. Do you see what I mean?

Between 2000 and 2007, Estonian GDP climbed an average of eight per cent per year. In 2009, it tumbled 14 per cent. Unemployment hit 19 per cent that year, and wages, in the private and public sectors, were slashed, in some cases by as much as 40 per cent.

The thing is that Greeks can decide, but their problem is that because of ineffective state bureaucracy, anything else than rudimentary cuts to outgoing money flows can't be done in short time span.

   I think when in comes to Thatcher, the only minority are those that can rationally discuss her. Most are evenly divided pro/against based on ideology and personal history.

She did a lot of things which were necessary and a lot more which were pushed by ideology and some which were just insane. You also have to remember that around her time, oil was discovered in the North Sea, which helped to no end, and the Falkland War happened, which helped confidence on both local and international levels.

The average marriage age was 22.7 years, getting married early was supported by the government.

My mom gave birth to me when she was 25 and she was considered to be old for a woman being pregnant for the 1st time. 

Families also got financial aids, which didn't have to be repaid when children were born. Chances were also higher to get an apartment when you were married with children. Apartments were always rare during the whole existence of the GDR. 

To sum it up, the government encouraged everyone to marry early and to get 2-3 children, so having children was very normal. 



AFAIK water torture was not used in East German prisons, they relied more on psychological methods like sleep deprivation, interrogations over and over again four hours and usually during the night. 

Political prisoners, esp. family members of those who escaped to the west, were often ""sold"" to West Germany. Between 1964 and 1989 West Germany ""bought"" 33755 political prisoners for ca. 3.5 billion DM. 
This is one reason why psychological torture was preferred over corporal punishment.


Some weeks ago I saw a documentary on Francis Gary Powers on German TV. He was a U2 pilot and was shot down over USSR territory in 1960. He was of course treated as a spy and interrogated by KGB officers using almost the same methods at the Stasi used. Maybe you can find some articles or interviews online that  describe these methods in English.

When you talk about getting the greek economy back on track most of you forget a tiny little details. Just set the deficit and the debts of the government aside for one moment and think about the private sector. Greece has had a negative foreign trade balance, for years.  These excessive imports are sucking the country dry. So throwing more money at the Greek people will probably account for nothing good. The money will just flow back within some time. That is why Greece leaving the €-zone has such beauty, even with all the risks attached. They would devalue their new currency. Greek exports would regain their competitiveness and imports would become so much more expensive.
So lets combine both problems again. So we get high debt, a high deficit and negative foreign trade balance  What would another bailout achieve?

Public sector wages, for example, rose 50% between 1999 and 2007 - far faster than in other eurozone countries.

The government's income was hit by widespread tax evasion and when the global financial downturn hit, therefore, Greece was ill-prepared to cope.

Debt levels reached the point where the country was no longer able to repay its loans, and was forced to ask for help from its European partners and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the form of massive loans.

I think some tough restrictions placed on them by the EU and IMF coupled with a period of terrible luck has placed both countries in the position they're in today.

&gt;The 75% haircut only applied to private creditors, which by and large were Greek institutions. 

The creditors are mainly banks. I have no idea where you got the idea that these are Greek institutions since Greece borrowed on the international market and Greek banks have been *very* reluctant to get into these kinds of deals.

&gt;Let's take the story from the beginning though. Greece's debt was 300 billion in 2009. Both bailouts are a combined 240 billion on top of that. The haircut decreased the debt by approximately 100 billion.
So, you have a debt that's already unsustainable, then almost double it in size, then remove half of what you added and then you say ""now, pay back"". It's impossible. 

No idea what you are trying to say here.

&gt;If the haircut came at the onset of the crisis, I would be extremely grateful for the kindness and if Greece wasn't fixed in a few years I would be completely embarrassed. 

We are still in the middle of the crisis. Even the Greek government themselves didn't fully know in what kind of trouble they were in. I think it is pretty outrageous to say a debt forgiveness of 75% is somehow unremarkable just because the negotiations - that Greece was a major part of - took so long.

&gt;But as it stands now, it's as much Greece's fault as it is the fault of the rest of the EU.

Everyone is entirely right that there is no point translating small, regional papers.  But Le Monde is a famous newspaper.  Why does it not have an international, English edition?  It should.

As for why Americans would be interested: the Euro crisis will affect America's economy, and Germany and France are big players in the EU.  We already read about Germany's and France's politics in our own papers because we want to understand the Euro situation, so I think there would be interest in getting the news straight from the horses' mouths, so to speak.

For example the sentence: Er hat eine neue Freundin. indicates that he has a new girlfriend/is in a new relationship. 

Sometimes you will even be confused if you are a native speaker and you have to ask to make things clear, so I guess most Germans will simply ask you if mix up things or if they are not sure what you meant, esp. when you are not a native speaker.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; So you knew there was substantial haircut but you still claimed otherwise?! Talk about discursive dishonesty...

I said what Greece needs, not what was done. My claim is still true. If the remaining amount of debt after the haircut is greater than the highest amount of debt it is reasonable to expect Greece to pay back, then you still have a problem and the debt must either be forgiven or restructured. 

&gt; The creditors are mainly banks. I have no idea where you got the idea that these are Greek institutions since Greece borrowed on the international market and Greek banks have been very reluctant to get into these kinds of deals.

You are misinformed. Greek banks bought Greek bonds by the truckload. Greek pensions funds heavily invested in Greek government bonds. The Bank of Greece consolidated all the accounts of Greek public institutions (universities, municipalities etc) into mutual funds and used them to buy Greek bonds. 

I am not saying that foreign investors did not take a hit. What I am saying is that Greek institutions that barely had enough money took a 75% hit. Foreign banks had two years to get rid of the Greek bonds before the haircut. This is why the 75% haircut is not as significant as it seems. 

&gt; No idea what you are trying to say here.

Well, maybe you should read it again. Let's put it into layman's terms: Imagine I owe you 100 euros and I come to you one day and say I can't pay it all back. Then, you give me another 100 euros and tell me to change my lifestyle so I will be able to give you back 200 euros next week. After the week is gone and I can't pay you back 200 euros, you tell me that you forgive part of my debt and I only have to pay back 150 euros now. Will that make the situation significantly better? 

&gt; I think it is pretty outrageous to say a debt forgiveness of 75% is somehow unremarkable just because the negotiations - that Greece was a major part of - took so long.

You are misinformed on this issue as well. It's not that the negotiations took two years to complete. If the haircut was applied right away then the governments of Germany, France etc would have to bail out their banks again, a second time in three years. The predatory and irresponsible lending practices of these banks would be exposed. That wouldn't fly with the electorate. There's also the issue of moral hazard: if debt is forgiven without repercussions, then everyone's going to want a similar deal.

&gt; How is the fault of the EU that Greece falsified their statistics and took credit after credit on the international market?

The falsifying of statistics is obviously not the EU's fault. But a lot of EU banks lent money to Greece irresponsibly. It takes two to tango and a bad loan is a bad decision on both parts. People were keenly aware of how much of a bubble the Greek economy was, so I don't really believe that they just trusted the statistics. The EU is also at fault for providing the Greek government with a bailout programme that was impossible to follow and lashing out against the Greek population for being unable to follow it. 

&gt; Whenever the EU or any of the EU countries doubted the official Greek numbers (in any field - for example agriculture subsidies) they were called arrogant, racist and what not.

I don't remember that ever happening. Can you please provide a source?

It could be an emerging country candidate, but the US and the EU are making sure that is not the case. So it follows that the head of the IMF is going to be from the EU, and if France and Germany agrees on a candidate, it almost follows that this candidate is going to be the one. But why French and not German ?

Now, France has a historical tradition of forming elite in a highly-methodical manner, notably public servant and military officier elite and they are highly regarded. What is particular compared to a lot of countries is that those elite are formed in specific schools in which you can enter after a competitive examination. French really valuethe fairness of that system. School fees are usually very cheap (exceptions are the purely economical schools), and in fact a little number of those elite schools, the most prestigious one, will even pay you as a public servant to study there. Napoléon for instance was a product of this system and an elite artillery officer (he was more than good in mathematics by the way), and when he came in power he was very grateful to that system and promoted it even more.

 For instance there is a school that forms elite public servant : the ENA, Ecole Normale de l'Administration, which requires a difficult competitive examination, often taken after 4/5 years of study and one year of preparation, and then follows 4 years of school meaning an ENA graduate has at least 8-9 years of study behind him. Anyway, French elite are very methodical, have a good general formation and then some more. It is more easy for them to achieve top position in international institutions because they are practically overqualified and are used to selective process (not to mention the fact that France, even though declining, is a major power, and French is still an international diplomatic language). There are even some jokes in European circles about how methodical the French are (they will always present their dissertation in a three-parts plan for instance).

As for Lagarde she is a product of what we call ""Sciences-Po"" which is prestitigious in France (even overrated) but I don't think it is overseas. She has an interesting background, with some american ties and one outstanding point is that she didn't do her studies in Paris which is rare for French elite, though she still is a product of that system.

So yes, absolutely, the comparison between US-Russian relations in the height of the Cold War and US-Chinese relations today, where both are world powers, are not at all equivalent comparisons.

It absolutely is globalisation that will keep the US and China from each others throats; neither wants to wreck their economies as both are large trading partners with each other, **something the US and USSR never were**, so I'm not sure why you're persistently pushing this point about US-Russian relations.

- a (former) ultra nationalist who claimed that all non-Serbs need to be eradicated; 

- does not hold a university degree (only high school, and a mediocre high school at best); 

- speaks only Serbian of all the languages

- has a vocabulary not appropriate for any politician, ESPECIALLY for a President. During a public debate in the Parliament, he once said to a fellow MP ""you fucking piece of shit, I'll fuck you up with the reply"". 

- insults and threatens people all the time; is unstable. During the election campaign, he said that he will physically fight anyone who tries to commit election fraud; the next day he denied having said that, even though it was on video.

Now, his election as a president did come as a surprise to everyone (including himself), as Tadić was way ahead of him in polls. But nevertheless, he was elected by the people - 50,24% of the people that is. Additionally, his party remains the strongest in Serbia since its formation. Thankfully it has never formed the government, but still. 

The President has no real power in Serbia but what troubles me the most is that **the majority of people voted for a guy** who fits the description above. Sure, some may claim that the people are dissatisfied with the previous government. But, he trailed Tadić only by 1% in both 2008 and 2004 elections. So obviously the support is there. 

So I am very sad to say that we the Serbs have a very serious problem on our hands. And not with Nikolić, but with our mentality. Our mentality that we are the most important nation in Europe, that we are the ones destined to rule this part of Europe (and more).

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;The US has smaller states but they don't feel dominated by larger states.

The US and EU are often compared, but on this issue I don't think they are analogous.  The states do not have a history of independence from each other.  They were always bound together in some kind of union, whether as British colonies or as states in the US or states in the Confederacy during the Civil War: always, they were bound together with other states in a federated union.

We are therefore not used to thinking of ourselves as being optionally part of a union.  That kind of mentality died with the Civil War.  The notion that certain states are taking advantage of others is sometimes raised, but it is not a big issue because that line of thinking leads toward disunion, and that is just not something Americans accept as comprehensible nowadays.  That kind of viewpoint would be dismissed immediately.

Europe, on the other hand, has the opposite kind of history: the nations of Europe have long traditions of sovereignty and independence, and a history of war with each other.  The US states have none of that, with the exception of the Civil War.  The idea of disunion is not immediately discarded in Europe, because that possibility is the norm rather than an unimaginable break with tradition, as it would be seen in the US.

Finally, we have the Senate, in which each state has equal representation regardless of their populations.  In the Senate, tiny Rhode Island has the same number of votes as massive California.

true,OkComputerScientist,null,null,"This. Whenever I come back to The U.S. from visiting Paris, I am often asked about the rudeness of the Paris/French people. The French are some of the most kind and welcoming people I have met; they do not hate Americans. There is the reason for the perceived rudeness, though: humans in big cities want stuff from you. Whether you are in New York, Boston, Atlanta, Paris, Tokyo, Rome, London, et al, random people are constantly trying to sell you something, get your attention, beg for money, etc. When large urban populations as we find in New York and Paris interact, the immediate response to a stranger coming up to us triggers the internal question, 'what does this person want?' Recently in Paris, I was completely annoyed by the number of people trying to sell me miniature Eiffel towers; draw my picture; bump test me to pickpocket; the list goes on. Becoming hard on the outside is just part of any large inner city culture.

However, with that said, even though most New Yorkers and Parisians move from point A to B without smiling, they're quite nice and just trying to get through life like the rest of us. Every time you say to a French person, ""Bonjour"" with a rising intonation in your voice and an attempted proper pronunciation, they smile and respond with ""Bonjour"" in kind. They are a culture of manners from inner city to farm house. Sure some people are odd, rude, and screwy here and there, but that is true of every culture on our planet. Remember to always attempt to speak French first, ALWAYS say, ""s'il vous plaît"" at the end of nearly every question to a stranger; always assume the use of ""vous"" formal in all interactions (until you are told otherwise or it's a small child); always say, ""merci."" Saying thank you even goes for meeting strangers on the street trying to sell you tourist crap or beg for a cigarette, just reply ""non, merci"" and they will go away. If you don't acknowledge their existence, as it is common to ignore people in The States, you are going to have a bad time; the stranger will get in your face and assume you are a rude American.

Lastly, as the above poster, CamilleElise4, points out, the Parisian attitude has more to do with tourists in general. If it walks like a tourist and sounds like a tourist, many locals just walk fast around them and/or skip eye contact. Note for life, SPEW715, if you don't want to be treated like a tourist in Paris, be polite and do not act like a typical unkempt sneaker-wearing tourist. This may seem odd to read, but most Parisians are really well dressed compared to Americans almost all the time. This means shoes and belt match for men; pants and well-cut form fitting jeans are worn by men and women; most sneakers are reserved for doing athletic activities (cross-bred sneaker/dress shoe designs as Ecco, Diesel, etc are popular, i.e. kicks with thin rubber soles and a color other than white). You have to realize that an average woman relaxing at a Paris café with friends looks like she fell out of a fashion advertisement or something similar and maybe wearing well-cut pants or a skirt, nice shoes, and wears a light amount of makeup. And the average hard core rough around the edges tattooed Parisian is still very polite and looks well put together, too, right down to the well-styled hair, crisp t-shirt, and boots. For anyone reading this from Paris who thinks I'm being superficial, please understand it is a complement that an entire city can dress really well in nearly all walks of life; I find it awesome. Oh, and one more thing btw, the French actually smell really good. If anything, your head will turn more than once whether you are male or female walking around town. So, not only do people look great, but they smell great, too. The only people this style commentary does not apply to are the homeless, newly arrived immigrants, and many, many tourists.

Finally, why the hell are you comparing with 2001 figures? Do you even have any idea what it would mean to drop spending to the levels of a decade ago?

Okay, let's calculate this, so you can see how completely out of tune with reality you are: 

The cumulative GDP decline in Greece the past few years has been around 17%. So, you want the total spending to decrease by the same amount or more, right? So, from 124.6 billion in 2009, you want it to decrease to 103.5 billion in 2011 (instead of 107 billion which is what actually happened). 

To do this with cuts, that would require 3.5 billion euros of additional cuts, which would bring the total primary expenditure to 89.5 billion, a total reduction of 21%. 

But you seemed to think even that wouldn't be enough. How about we say we completely balance the budget? That would require the total expenditure to fall to 88.1 billion euros, which would require additional cuts to the tune of 19 billion. (total reduction of 29%).

So, the implication here is that the primary spending should have fallen between 21% and 29%.

Leyendo [este artículo](http://www.elblogsalmon.com/mercados-financieros/por-que-se-rescato-a-los-grandes-bancos) he encontrado un párrafo que creo que da una posible respuesta a tu pregunta: 

&gt; Muchos se preguntan constantemente porqué los gobiernos socorrieron a la banca, y en rigor, la gráfica nos proporciona una respuesta: El sistema se hizo demasido grande: la línea naranja (deuda bancaria) cubre varias veces la linea negra (deuda pública) y su colapso tendría enormes consecuencias. Esto es porque los problemas de la banca privada tienden a convertirse en problemas públicos durante una crisis: paralización de pagos, bloqueo en el flujo de créditos, caída en la demanda y la producción, inestabilidad de precios y salarios, aumento del desempleo, desórdenes sociales, etc. Además, hay una garantía estatal a los depósitos, es decir, hay un matrimonio, forzado o no, entre la banca y el Estado.

No sé si es o no una respuesta válida a tu pregunta, pero en todo caso creo que queda más o menos claro que *un banco NO es una empresa cualquiera con beneficios privados*, y que por lo tanto el hecho de que quiebre *puede* tener otras muchas consecuencias.

A partir de ahi yo ni digo que haya que rescatarlos ni que no haya que rescatarlos, solo digo que este es un tema complejo donde los haya y el que todo aquel que vaya pregonando que la solución es muy sencilla tiene, según lo veo yo, más bién poca credibilidad.",0,1338202183,null,0,1338203190,0,c4t84pp,t3_u8j7q,t1_c4t84pp,t1_c4t81h7,null,1429015293,5,false,es,t5_22i2,5

Absolutely not, but consider that as far as some people are concerned, wearing a jersey of the ""wrong"" club is an unforgiveable faux pas in itself - being in Munich [does not mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich#Rivalries) that you're surrounded by Bayern supporters and Bayern is currently target of a lot of ridicule, since they just managed to ruin their season in a slapstick-like fashion by losing three competitions on the home stretch and haven't won anything for the past two years (which amounts to an embarrassing disaster for a club as confident/arrogant as Bayern), so supporters of rival clubs will use this opportunity to gloat. If you did mishear the raucous drunk guy shouting insults about your club at you in a foreign language your mind might have just filled in some gaps. Any ways, no reason to dwell on it: Drunk football supporters can be the worst, don't let one asshole ruin your trip.
 
And as far as the staring is concerned, continental Europeans tend to consider staring to be rude, but the amount of time someone can look at someone else without it being considered to be staring tends to be *a lot* longer than in North America and this difference has made many North Americans I met somewhat uncomfortable at one point or another.

Until 1994 there was a big 'center' party that won pretty much every time, especially in opposition to the left wing parties, who were seen as dangerously close to the communists. Then a big corruption scandal happens, and the party blows up.

Berlusconi, a successful media entrepreneur, appears and states that he's going to build a modern alternative to the 'old politics' and starts to gather the center-right parties around him, waving the terrible danger of the 'communist left' as the inevitable alternative. He wins.

He starts messing up the laws in his favor (he owns the largest media conglomerate in Italy, including the 3 main private channels). As head of parliament, he basically controls the 3 public TV channels, leading to a massive conflict of interests that is, however, ignored.

With massive 6-channel propaganda, targeted law reforms for big companies (false accounting? that shouldn't be a crime!), promises of tax cuts and endless jobs and as only bulwark against the commies (a constant danger) he keeps being elected. Along the way he also picks up post-fascists, the Northern League separatists who are looking for a spot in parliament and provide a bunch of votes in the north, and -allegedly- mafia contributions who, after all, seem to like him a lot.

Now that most of his promises, after almost 20 years, have turned out to be only to his advantage many people are waking up from the spell.

They knew about Hitler and they knew he was killing Jews but the education about World War II didn't seem to be as important as it is here in Germany. It's not really their country's history so you can't blame them for not being as well educated about this as the average German kid is (or should be). Ask any 16-yo German kid about the American revolution and you'll probably get similar results.

I rent through pisospordiasmadrid.com, and I share a 2-BR, 2 bath apartment with two classmates. They charged 2000 euros for 6 weeks, which was fair based on my searches and came to less than $50 per night. Full kitchen, washer, large balcony, a/c, free internet, etc.

If you find a place near a stop on the gray line, you'll be close to campus. I live near Retiro Park, which is a beautiful area, and it takes me 20-25 minutes to get from my apartment to school.

As for the language barrier, you might want to get a Livemocha account or find a copy of Rosetta Stone. I have a very basic level of Spanish, and I have had a lot of trouble. Unlike other European cities I've visited, there are not a lot of English-speaking folks around here. The immediate university area is safe, but even the stores and restaurants nearby are difficult to navigate without a basic understanding.

This city is fabulous, by the way. I'm very much enjoying my time here.

Good luck!

I had someone come up to me in the Straßenbahn and say, ""Fick alle amerikanischen Faschisten im Arsch,"" just because I was speaking English. 

Don't get the wrong idea. I *love* Germany and the people who live here. The nicest man I ever met in my life was an old German guy. I met him when I went to a restaurant where a musician was playing, but there were no seats left. He invited me and my friend to his table, and insisted on buying our dinner. When I asked about the cause of his immense generosity, he told me that he was 8 in 1945, and his family was starving because the American troops were approaching and the Nazis had blockaded the area. When the Americans finally arrived, he said an American soldier gave him and his family all of his food rations, and that he's been grateful to Americans ever since. So he bought my meal at a restaurant in Germany 66 years later, despite my protests. 

So I love Germany, and I think the people here are overwhelmingly the kindest and nicest people I've ever met.

true,Ostias,null,null,"Spent three years studying in Santiago, such an awesome city. Yeah, it is pretty much like Salamanca in the sense of it being a city full of college students. During the academical year it is full of students, while in summer it is totally the opposite thing.

Basically there are two parts of the city: the old town and the new town.

The center of the old town I'd say it is the ""Plaza del Obradoiro"", which is where the city hall and the cathedral are (obligatory place to visit!). You can wander around the streets and bars there, it is a pretty awesome place. Also, at the entrance of the old town there is a park called ""La alameda"" (http://www.acompostela.com/files/u1/vista_lado_este_alameda.jpg).

Then there's the new part and the ""Plaza Roja"", the center of it. Not much to see here, it is the modern part and where most of the shops are. But still, it is also a very nice place. The train station is quite near from here. The bus station is a bit further away, but you can easily get there by bus in like less than 10 minutes (it is the line number 5 if I remember correctly).

The university is split in two parts: South Campus in the modern part of the city, and North Campus in the old part. It depends on what you are studying wether you will have your classes on one or the other. Also, learn Spanish, since the level of English is generally abysmal (I can see from your post you speak it quite well though). Maybe even some of your classes are in Galician instead of Spanish, that depends on the teacher mostly.

The common day to go out at night is thursdays, since most of the students leave the city on fridays to go back to their parents' houses for the weekend, but you can go out on fridays, saturdays and even wednesdays and there will surely be people around too. Not mondays, I tried that once: we were the only ones around and almost everything was closed lol. The old town is where the smaller pubs are, while the new part of the city is where the bigger, more modern pubs are (just a matter of what you prefer).

And yeah, bring an umbrella lol.

Don't know what else to say, ask away if you want to know something else. I'll try to answer the best way I can.

&gt; Lions feature heavily in Ancient Greek mythology and writings including myth of the Nemean Lion which was believed to be a supernatural lion which occupied the sacred town of Nemea in the Peloponnese. Aristotle and Herodotus wrote that lions were found in the Balkans in the middle of the first millennium BCE. When Xerxes advanced through Macedon in 480 BCE he encountered several lions. But while lions presumably still existed in the area between the rivers Aliakmon and Nestus in northern Greece in Herodotus' time, in the first century CE Dio Chrysostom already wrote that they were extinct in Europe.

true,ajehals,null,null,"&gt;You could say the same about the British, but we don't really have any choice at all.

We should.  The whole issue we have at the moment is that no-one seems to want to take any responsibility for what their democratically elected and representative governments do any more.  Instead, we have people saying that our votes don't really count and we don't have a say... Which is idiotic when we realise that 40+% of people don't vote in general elections (sometimes more, sometimes less and it depends on where you are) and that the number who turn out in locals is even smaller.  Essentially we aren't living up to our responsibilities collectively and there isn't really an excuse.  The outcome is shit like this, where we benefit in resource and foreign policy terms, but blame the bad stuff on governments that we are apparently powerless to do anything about.

&gt;It was the same with the involvement in Ireland..

What shite, The problems in Ireland started well before anyone had a formal say in the governance of the country, the more recent (shall we say 100 year) history has been about dealing with the fucked up situation.  Unfortunately the issues in Ireland were horribly splintered and hard to deal with, after all there were two sides of an issue with people using violence on both sides of it and no simple solution.

&gt;ordinary people had nothing to do with it, but were attacked because of the ""collective blame"" that you are espousing.

Again, Ireland is a really bad example (especially recently..), you have what amounts to a low intensity civil war that costs a lot of civilian casualties and deaths in Northern Ireland and a campaign on the British Mainland that is largely focused on what you might call 'legitimate' targets (That is the military, the police, the government and the financial sector).  Multiple attacks, shootings etc.. The British government at the same time went after paramilitaries and those it classed as sympathisers in Northern Ireland (and did some pretty abhorrent things in the process, but not quite on a scale that we have seen in the last decade).

Spain is mostly Gayfriendly, people are very conscient about homosexuality and gay marriage is allowed. It's strange to find openly homophobic people, maybe some weirdo who tells you somthing like ""poor boy, i hope you get cured"" or something like that (who knows); in the cities you can find gay bars if you want (if you are very interested in this I can ask some friends); in towns mostly the same, but without bars, I think I heard on the news once there was a town dedicated to gay tourism, strange thing I think.

true,Norrsken,SWED,Sweden,"Interesting topic. May I ask where you are from? I know it is sometimes being discussed in Sweden, which has around 1500 people who takes their own life every year. It is more than 10 times as many who get murdered, 4 -5 times as many who dies on the road etc. Still, it not getting half of the attention.

In Sweden it typically get talked about, once a year, they interview a parent/partner on TV, got through statistic etc, and then it doesn't really get talked about. I just recently picked up a (new) book about this in the bookstore (didn't buy it) and the organisation against suicide came out with a book with advice what the Swedes could do as a society to prevent suicides. With the princess being baptised, our own serial killer and the crises in Europe, it hasn't been getting a lot of attention though (just a tad cynical here).

I think the reasons are a several:

First,there's a lot of shame around suicide. Even as progressive as we are supposed to be, the survivors/families talk about the guilt and shame that they feel. I am not saying it's right, but I think a lot of people do feel that way. Guilt and shame are tough feelings, both to carry, but also to talk about as a friend/colleguet etc. Thus, we prefer not to mention it. 


Second - a lot of the people who kills themselves have psychiatric problems. There is, unfortunately, al lot of stigma attached to attached to that thus we prefer not to talk about it. It so much easier to feel sorry for someone with cancer than to deal with the messiness that is manic depression for example. 


Third-sometimes it's failure from hospitals/doctors. It has become better, at least here, since they are able to ""report"" themselves without being charged (in a ""what went wrong way""), but it's also not in their interest to have their failure written across the front page of the newspapers.


Fourth - I think it would take some investement that you can't immediately see the benefits of. We all know that those investements can be notoriously difficult to do for the politicians, since we as voters rarely demand them, and who cares what happens 10 year down the line if one wants to get re-elected.


Fifth - some of the of the countries in the top seem to be in the vodka belt, some seem to be to have a notoriously high ""pressure""/honour (Japan, South Korea). I think there might be a lot of cultural factors that are at play that and that is so difficult to deal with. To critisize your own culture and then to try to distangle what in it makes people kill themselves is not very popular, and difficult.  


I also see a lot of people citing the lack of sun, and there's nothing to do about that. I honestly think that is just a minor problem, if you look at that list Sweden, Norway, Canada should be way higher on the list, particularely compared to Croatia, Japan etc. Even someone have studies about that I would like to see it. I think it might be a factor, but a minor one. 


The thing that made the most difference in Sweden is the new anti-depressants that came in the 90's (which we can see in the statistic, God, Swedes really love statistics) and I think new behavouir/attention from medical personnel etc:


**TL:DR Suiciedes are messy and complicated, and a lot of factors weigh in why we kill ourselves. Thus, we rather stay away and let it slide**

And you should also remember that, while Americans joke about the Third Reich and everything, I don't think they mean it to be insensitive or mean. There's a shared cultural heritage between the UK, America and Australia, and I think if you talk to people from any of those countries, you'll find that they joke about things all the time. Americans (as well as Britons and Australians) will make 9/11 jokes and Holocaust jokes, and they'll ""take the piss out of people,"" but that doesn't mean they're complete assholes. I think that we just deal with difficult events through humor, whereas Germans seem to take things more seriously in general. 

I personally have been living in Germany for nine months, and I like to think that I appreciate the culture very much. But if other Americans talk about Lederhosen, green hats, Maß's of beer, and the Third Reich, that doesn't necessarily mean that they don't know about the ""real"" Germany.

true,skgsergio,null,null,"Primero decir que soy un estudiante de Informática y no un Economista con lo cual mi opinión queda en el ""me interesa el tema, he leído mucho sobre ello, he hablado con amigos que actualmente viven allí y he sacado mis propias conclusiones"", dicho esto allá voy:

Obviamente el ""modelo Islandés"" o mas bien ""la decisión Islandesa"" fue, para ellos, un buen camino pero para nosotros no lo es por dos factores (más allá del ""son una isla y tienen 300mil habitantes""):

 * Ellos tenían **moneda propia** y pudieron devaluarla, lo cual fue un factor muy muy importante en su decisión.
 * **No** están en una **Unión Europea** en la cual tienes dependencia económica entre países y no puedes tomar decisiones de esa escala salvo que decidas salir de ahí (véase Grecia).


**¿Que deberíamos/podríamos hacer?**

Considero que una nacionalización de los bancos que están muriendo o al menos una intervención del estado para controlarlos es muy importante a la hora de realizar los prestamos que se han hecho en la anterior legislatura y los que se han hecho/se van a hacer en esta legislatura (no podemos hablar aquí de colores del partido ya que ambos juegan en el mismo campo).

Una vez hecho el paso anterior y, por supuesto, con vistas a que ese dinero se devuelva (si hace falta a largo plazo) debemos plantearnos si deberíamos realizar una reestructuración del sistema económico del país en lo que a bancos se refiere, esto si podemos mirar un poco a Islandia. Debemos realizar una serie de restricciones sobre lo que los bancos pueden o no pueden hacer con el dinero que se les confía (claro está que de alguna forma hay que sacar beneficio y los bancos que no te cobran comisiones por algo es... cuantas menos comisiones desconfía más) para evitar futuros casos.


Otro tema, el cual afecta a la población, es el embargo por hipotecas impagada. Actualmente un banco que embarga a una persona no condona la deuda al realizar el embargo, si no que se sigue cobrando dicha hipoteca al cliente y eso no puede funcionar así. Pero como digo, eso no tiene que ver con el sistema económico que es lo que te interesa.


Con esto me desahogo un poco viendo el futuro negro que nos espera a los jóvenes y viendo lo que estamos pasando todos ahora... ¿Que pensáis vosotros?

true,allihaveismymind,null,null,"Holy crap, this is a good one. Hello, german person here! After 47 comments I still feel obligated to add my 2 cents, as this is right up my alley.

First of all, I'm tired and may not express myself the best way possible - if so, I'll try to add tomorrow. Secondly: this is, despite it's political nature, a tremendous intellectual performance that should speak to both left and right wingers (if you decide to adhere to binary divisions), as it undeniably predicts our current world politics situation (keep in mind, it's from a couple of years ago, relatively shortly after 2001).

**Some general things you should know/think about/take into consideration:**

* This is not standup. It a specific form of (so called; I don't like or agree with the term) 'high-brow' intellectual ""cabaret"", that does not appeal to the lowest common denominator in the way regular standup tends to do. The format suffers from certain established speech patterns and accepted forms of expression, nevertheless has a much higher demand in regards to intellectual participation than traditional standup. **It is not meant to be entertainment as such!**

* you will notice that the subtitles move quickly, which can be challenging - often times, I find there are only split seconds to digest important points to follow certain trains of thought before he moves on to something else. In the original german, this is *still* challenging, but I imagine following subtitles only is even harder. While there are numerous mistakes/inaccuracies/imperfections in the subtitles, on the whole they do an excellent job. Keep in mind they are an *approximation*, and you will benefit greatly from them. If you are interested enough, slow down/pause the video to get it all, he really speeds through a lot of big-picture-stuff.

* to those who called this standard leftist hogwash/whatever: you may point out many instances where he is polemic, and you may disagree with the overall worldview he projects - but if you just listen to what he says, you will find an ugly history lesson based on **hard facts**, no matter how much you dislike him or the way he speaks or connects events. It is also an accurate prediction of the world we now find ourselves living in. You can't argue that away based on personal politics.

* **He does not intend to speak 'truth to power' in a way you would expect!** If you bother to watch the whole thing, you will notice that he spends quite some time bashing the 'usual suspects', but his ultimate audience and target are the people *who agree with his premise and came there to see him!* It is *their* (and thus our) apathy and resignation he preaches against, if you can call this preaching. Personally, I find myself interested more than invested in this performance, but the contrary voices I've read so far steered me to stress this point.


I've been awake for more than 24h by far at this point, so I'll leave it at that. If you would like to debate or further explore any of my points, I'll check back and answer.

Totalmente de acuerdo con lo de moneda propia y posibilidad de devaluar, que es como todos los países habían salido de las crisis hasta ahora. Efectivamente esa es una enorme diferencia entre el caso islandés y el español.

Aclarar que lo de 311,000 habitantes vs 47 millones me sigue pareciendo importante ya que un sistema más complejo es más difícil de sanear. Y el número de habitantes es un buen indicador de complejidad.

El único punto polémico que le veo a la explicación es la de:

&gt; ""actualmente un banco que embarga a una persona no condona la deuda al realizar el embargo, si no que se sigue cobrando dicha hipoteca al cliente y eso no puede funcionar así""

Ya sabes que el banco no cobra la casa por partida doble, sencillamente te pide que le devuelvas lo que él te ha prestado. Entiendo que el banco está vendiendo la casa por su cuenta a un precio bastante bajo y aún exige la diferencia al hipotecado. Pero el banco ya sabe que en el mejor de los casos tardará décadas en cobrar esta diferencia. Desde el punto de vista individual parece inhumano, pero si se mira a gran escala:

1. Los bancos no pueden asumir todas esas pérdidas solo por el hecho de ""intentar ser más humanos"": después necesitará un rescate el cual pagaremos todos y que posiblemente hunidrá el país. Y el hundimiento del país me parece todavía más inhumano, además de hacer pagar a justos por pecadores (ver punto #2).

2. Todos sabemos que uno de los grandes problemas ha sido que la gente creía que el dinero de las tarjetas de crédito, préstamos, etc, era ""dinero grátis"". En cierta manera me parece coherente que esta gente pague por su error.

Ya sé que probablemente ahora entraremos en la discusión de que ""no era culpa de la gente, era culpa de los bancos que ofrecían hipotecas a gente que sabrían que no las podría pagar"". Está claro que los bancos no están libres de culpa ni mucho menos, pero también está claro que no pusieron la pistola en la cabeza a nadie para que comprara una hipoteca, ni se saltaron ningún tipo de legislación para hacer lo que hicieron. Sencillamente se aprovecharon de la desinformación y la estupidez ajena **que es lo que han hecho en mayor o menor medida casi todas las empresas en todo sistema capitalista**.

Yo no estoy para nada de acuerdo con el sistema capitalista actual: por ejemplo regularía de forma mucho más estricta la publicidad, rebajando el listón de ""publicidad engañosa"". También regularía otras muchas partes del sistema, sobretodo en lo que a protección del cliente se refiere. Pero hablando de forma estricta, los bancos no hicieron nada mucho más inmoral que lo que hace Apple cuando intenta vender que ""si no te compras un iphone de XXX$ es que no eres guay"". Vale, si, estamos hablando de XXX$ (Apple) vs XXX,XXX$ (bancos). Pero no creo que la cantidad influya en la moralidad: el sistema de publicidad/engaño utilizado es el mismo, y ambos se mueven dentro del marco legal.

Aclarar también que yo también estoy a favor de un sistema más *social* en el que si uno cae en desgracia el resto le rescate. Pero eso es realizable si hay un pequeño % de personas que no pueden pagar la hipoteca por causas ajenas a su control, pero no si hay un gran % que no pueden pagar porque **apostaron** sus ahorros a 40 años y perdieron la apuesta... pues no veo cómo se puede aplicar un sistema más *humano* a toda esta gente.

Todo el mundo habla de que hay que dar una lección a los bancos para que no la vuelvan a cagar. Y estoy totalmente de acuerdo. Pero acaso no hay que darles también una lección a todos esos centenares de millares de personas que creyeron que podrían estar pagando 2000 eur/mes durante 40 años? A mi esta gente me da bastante miedo y me parece todavía más peligrosa que los bancos si cabe...

&gt; ""We know that football events are often clouded by a variety of racist incidents. I was strongly interested in the plans of the Ukrainian side to prevent such accidents. They were willing to answer these questions. It seems to me that in the forthcoming championship, as one might expect, a big preparatory work is underway,"" the Professor of International Law said.

&gt; He stressed that Ukraine is proud of reducing the number of racially motivated crimes and the absence of a serious national conflicts. The British professor with interest accepted information that the Kyiv authorities are planning events dedicated to the memory of the Holocaust of Roma and other ethnic groups.

&gt; ""In general, the delegation [representing Ukraine at the meeting of the Committee - ed.] believes that, despite the problems, the Ukrainian society is very tolerant and sympathetic,"" Thornberry emphasized.

&gt; Among the unresolved problems the delegation itself, and the Rapporteur named the country's lack of a special law aimed at combating racial discrimination, and issues related to the problem of the deported peoples, especially the Crimean Tatars.

We had some cases of books like these which were taken home by soldiers after the war - a huge amount of books was outsourced to tunnels and bunkers in the last years of the war. It certainly looks as if it's gotten wet over the time.

Is there any stamp on any of the pages you might be able to photograph? If not on the first pages, look up page 33. 

After all, my first impression is that this book belongs to a german library. I know you and your family probably don't want to hear this as it might technically be a stolen good, but books of this age deserve their fair treatment which, above all, means not being exposed to bright light, being keept relatively cool and with a specific humidity in the air.

true,KripoBatic,null,null,"Here's the list I wish I'd had before I arrived.  It's generally more productive to search for names of stores in google maps than general things like ""markt"", so here's the names of stores you'll want to know

*Groceries:* General terms for grocery stores include ""markt"" and ""supermarkt"".  The german 101 term is ""lebensmittelgeschäft"".  Stores to look for are Aldi, Lidl, Penny Markt, Rewe (accepts credit cards!! this is rare!), Edeka. I must be forgetting some. Groceries are generally cheap but I suppose it depends on what exactly you like to eat. I average 1-2€ per item, but I also eat out a lot.  

*Drogeries:* This means ""drug store"" essentially, but grocery stores basically only have food so you almost have to go here if you want any kind of selection of toothpaste, shampoo, etc.  Stores to look for are Müller and dm. You should be able to find low-end necessities again in the 1-2€ range.  

*Apothekes:* These are pharmacies.  You have to go here if you want over the counter medicine.  Drogeries have vitamins and holistic stuff, but no aspirin.  They're pretty good so if you're having a problem and not sure if you should go to a doctor, check the apotheke first.  They are everywhere.  Most business close by 8, but you should be able to find a list of apothekes that are open overnight and on holidays at any apotheke.  They take turns keeping odd hours. 

*Fast food:* Döner (kebab).  It's cheap and delicious. This is also where you get pizza in germany (typically).  Cheapest stuff on the menus is ~3.50€ and the most expensive is ~7-8€.  You can also get good cheap sandwiches at bakeries (they are everywhere).  Eating out, the only thing you'll pay an arm and a leg for is soda.  They don't offer you tap water (you can ask but they look at you funny).  Beer is practically the same price.  A weird thing they do: They like putting fizzy water in things -- apfelschorle is the most popular (apple juice and mineral water.  nasty, imo).  They also like mixing beverages in general.  Radler is beer and lemonade (also nasty), spezi is orange juice and cola (surprisingly not nasty, but cola-orange drinks from the supermarket are pretty bad), etc.  

*Cheap stuff:* You should be able to find a 1€ store somewhere.  The one near me is called ""Allerdings"", but I've seen a variety of names in different places.  They generally have things like batteries, some cooking utensils, greeting cards, slippers, stupid antler hats at christmas, etc.

*Target/walmart-type stores:* I've never been to a Real, but this should be an example of such a place.  There's a Kik Textil near me where I load up on cheap socks periodically.  They sell mostly clothing, but you can also get cheap cleaning supplies, saran wrap, some other things. What's in stock varies.  

*Construction stores:* Bauhaus, OBI, Praktiker

Can't offer much help on the social aspects.  There are lots of clubs, so if you're into sports or some specific activity, look for ""verein"" and ""stammtisch"" affiliated with that activity.  ""Kneipe"" is also a word associated with regular gatherings for some specific purpose.  It's been my experience that germans like to gather.  There's a platz in my city where people just gather and spread out and picnic in huge groups in the evening.  Dunno the protocol for mingling, but if you're the outgoing type you'll probably find them all very friendly and welcoming.

I got to know a theologist pretty well (you could have very nice conversations with him, he holds degrees in theology, history, law and was an army officer as well) and he used to describe the parades as an act of pure idolatry. He especially didn't like that 90% of the people you see on the streets in tears when they see the *pasos* never go to church during the year. They get married in a church (big traditional party), have their children baptized (slightly smaller party), celebrate their 1st communion (another big party) and get a priest called when they're about to die; that's all.

As for the San Fermines, I'd say that the runs have eclipsed the bull-fighting. If bull-fighting gets banned in Spain, they will still do the runs for sure (this is what Catalonia decided to do last year - ban bull-fighting, keep all other popular events with bulls).

Castellers are quite controversial on their own too, because of the danger for the children that climb to the top. Fortunately they wear helmets now.

Examples: Fox News, Conservapedia. They will engage in character assassination and diversions to cover their inability to refute the central points of argument*, because the bottom line is that their motivations differ from what can reasonably be argued. In this case, what they say is that global warming is just a shaky theory, what they mean is that they don't really give a shit about future generations or the damage we're causing to the biodiversity of the world as long as their gas prices don't rise. How that can even be called conservatism is beyond me, but it's a viewpoint almost universally associated with the word.

So as for your request for one rational reason why government grants are more neutral and objective than private grants: because the government grants come with public oversight. Governments are not neutral entities without interests, on the contrary, they are fueled by many interests that keep each other checked. Private funding on the other hand is motivated by one single interest: profit maximization. And they are not required to even try to keep scientifically grounded.

Finally, and I concede that this is not a rational argument, the accusation from political forces that government scientists are in it for the money is just sickening. I know quite a few 'government' climate scientists personally at the University of Copenhagen, and I can relate that they are motivated primarily by the pursuit of objective knowledge. There is quite a lot of debate that goes on on these topics in there, but the plurality and scientific skepticism is lost to the public because they are constantly forced to polarize their opinions by politicians and pundits who take their results and statements out of context to bend the facts to affirm their ideologies. I will concede that liberals are guilty of ideology, but then modern conservatives are so far gone into it that they don't even see it anymore, they think that their own information channels are the only ones who are fair and balanced, while everyone else, including reality itself, has a liberal bias.

Wie soll die Schelte aussehen? Gehst du da vorbei und klopfst den Betrügern auf die Finger...wenns wie Gutti ist. Und bei Wulff dann haft wegen Betrug im Amt?
Ist das Schelte?

Für mich klingt das was du schreibst wie ein Wiederkäuen von kurzfristigen Kritiken an den Kritikern.
Bis heute sieht weder Herr Wulff ein, dass er Betrug begangen hat obwohl gegen ihn ermittelt wird.

true,frequentfly,null,null,"This is exploitative on behalf of the French employer, however, it is fairly common in Paris, especially in industries such as fashion. As others have mentioned, it is illegal on the employer's side to not pay an intern. Furthermore, your Spanish residency gives you no right to work or reside within the EU in general. Legally, it would be the same as if you are coming directly from your country of origin (US?) and interning. (Please note this should not be construed as legal advice, and I am not an immigration lawyer.) 

Practically, however, since you'll probably be coming to France from Spain, you won't get your passport stamped. You technically have 90 days under Schengen to be in France as a tourist. It won't be clear at the airport when you leave how long you've been in France, so even if you stay a few days later it probably won't matter. 
 
So yes, definitely illegal, but in all likelihood, you won't get caught. It's your call. Many people wouldn't want to work for a company that skirts the law, many others think it is good business sense. 

Just on a more personal note: I suggest trying to strongly evaluate what you expect out of this internship. If you start doing things for free, I've noticed that you start to devalue your time. It's hard to convince future employers of how much you should be paid when you last worked for free. Make sure you're going to have a good learning experience and remember, Paris is expensive!

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Yes, my experience has pretty much run in the opposite way: conservatives will go to basically any lengths to make their world-view stick, regardless of any pesky facts that run counter to it. Examples: Fox News, Conservapedia.

Those are the absolutely worst conservative publications, absolutely low-brow. Try City Journal, New Criterion, New English Review, Prospect, Spectator. The high-brow ones.

&gt;So as for your request for one rational reason why government grants are more neutral and objective than private grants: because the government grants come with public oversight

Yes. Theoretically. Practically no one have ever lost an election by funneling a few million towards some fraudulent research. Elections are won and lost by lot more visible things.

&gt;Governments are not neutral entities without interests, on the contrary, they are fueled by many interests that keep each other checked.

But it seems you focus only on the external influences in government, and forget government's _own_ interest, i.e. the interest of the politicial-bureaucratic class to extend its own power. This is a whole lot more important than one external interest group pulling it this way, another that way.

I mean, yes, influences can be balanced in the sense of for example an environmentalist group want this while a corporate group wants that, the opposite. But government's own interest is to _be allowed to decide on things not allowed before_. While all other interest groups are about what should be decided, it is about does government get the right decide on something, or must leave it to society's self-decision, more or less through the marketplace. This is of an extreme importance. Without this the last 100 years cannot be understood: the emergence of government as an extremely important interest group on its own. (It is not very visible, because most intellectuals tend to be part of the government class, being in academia etc. so intellectuals tend not to publicize and maybe even not recognize the existence of this huge interest group.)

And this is why any government-funded research into a problem obviously unsolvable without effectively creating a command economy is extremely suspicious, because it just plays so nice in the interests of the government class.

Private funding is often motivated by profit maximization, yes. Not in every case. Typically in those cases that got hopelessly, how to put it, bureaucratized. When a bunch of short-term, disinterested shareholders elect an employee-CEO then yes, as profit is the only thing they understand. But when a man with a vision owns and manages a corporation, then it is about a whole lot more thing than just profits.

I am including only claims and not the argumentation, to keep this short and to make the points more clear. I'm also omitting some interesting things that are very peripheral to the subject at hand. 

&gt; There is a lot of talk about applying the principles of the free markets (competition, free trade etc) everywhere but what actually happens in practice is this: ""free markets are fine for you, but not for me"". 

&gt; This idea was first applied to Third World countries and is called the [Washington consensus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_consensus). Debt is socialised, markets are liberalised so Western companies can exploit them unobstructed, assets are privatised so that we can buy them at fire sale prices. 

&gt; When it's being applied at home, it's a bit more nuanced: So, powerful government to protect the rich, and market discipline and tough love for everyone else. So, what are the terms that are used for these policies to give a logical semblance to this process? 

&gt; The first one is about **reducing government**. However, we're not really reducing government, we're shifting it around. So, social spending goes down, but subsidies for corporations go up. And because the people are usually opposed to cuts in social spending, you have to control them somehow: that is achieved by creating a culture of fear via demonising groups of the population, criminalising more and more behaviours and harshening prison conditions. 

&gt; The second aspect of it is what's called **devolution**. By moving powers from the federal level to the state level, private interests can control them easier because state governments are easier to push around than the federal government (*note*: this doesn't really apply in the EU's situation; remember, this was originally written about the USA). 

&gt; Another aspect is **reforms** (*note*: I guess this is equivalent to the term ""structural reforms"" that's being thrown around during this crisis) This can have many forms (regressive taxes, labour flexibility, etc) but the essence of it is that taxes are raised and subsidies are decreased for the poor and at the same time taxes are lowered and subsidies are increased for the rich. This results in so-called ""economic miracles"", meaning the economy is doing fine, it's just that the people aren't. 

&gt; Next up is **privatisation** and increasing **property rights**. Privatisation means, as usual, handing over public assets to friends of the President, or you know, other rich people, or international investors, at a fraction of their cost. As for property rights, the worst case is intellectual property rights: They come from public subsidy, usually through research, and then are handed over to some private corporation, and nobody else is allowed to touch them for fifty years. 

&gt; The last element is **reducing trade barriers**. That usually means to  increase the power of transnational corporations. They move part of their operations to a country that is deregulated, where you can get much cheaper labour and you don't have to worry about pollution and so on. This makes it seem that there is an increase in trade, because of all of these cross-border operations, but it's not trade in any meaningful sense of the word because it actually is just internal to individual corporations; it's corporate mercantilism and the concepts of freedom and markets have disappeared.

&gt; In the end, the supposed values of democracy and markets are warped. Democracy means: deceive people into doing what the rich people want. And markets means: make sure the public subsidize the rich. ",0,1338294714,null,0,1338294931,0,c4tmdhs,t3_u9e2a,t1_c4tmdhs,t3_u9e2a,null,1429022142,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

On the other hand, more left-leaning Democrats are disappointed in Obama due to his expansion of executive power, continuation of the wars, and due to the perception that he's conceded too much to Congressional Republicans in debates such as the one over healthcare. 

I happen to fall into the second camp, and if you say you'll never vote for a Republican, maybe you do, too. You of course have every right to (not) vote however you please.

Äh, was?! Dreht was nicht mehr?

*edit: Da dreht offenbar nichts mehr. Guckt euch mal diesen Absatz an:

Erweiterung der öffentlichen Güter – hier: Freifahrt für alle – ist nicht ohne ein neues Steuersystem, letztlich Steigerung der Einnahmen von *Gemeinden, Ländern und Bund* zu haben, dies aber entweder durch Erhöhung der *Verbrauchssteuern oder durch Vermögenssteuern, eine Erbschaftssteuer, die diesen Namen verdient, und scharfe Progression der Einkommenssteuern* – auf keinen Fall aber mit einem Staat, der nichts einnehmen und nichts ausgeben darf. Damit befindet sich, wer derlei fordert in einer älteren sozial- und wirtschaftspolitischen Auseinandersetzung, auf die sich die Piratenpartei bislang noch nicht einließ. Aber immerhin bezeichnen sich einige ihrer Politiker als sozialliberal.

Da fehlt etwas. Viele Piraten sehen sich nach einfachen Abrechnungen. Die Energiefrage bietet sich doch für eine einfach Umlagerung von den ""energetisch dummen"" zu den ""energetisch intelligenten"" an. Wer braucht, dem wird noch mehr genommen, wer lebt, ohne anderen was wegzunehmen, dem wird noch gegeben. Damit am Ende entweder effizienter oder, noch besser, weniger verbraucht wird. Wieso ein kostenloser ÖV eine Erweiterung der öffentlichen Güter darstellt, verstehe ich nicht. Dieser wird sowieso fast ganz von den Banken (via Kredit) und mit Steuern finanziert. Die Tageseinnahmen decken ja teils nicht einmal die Löhne. 

Wenigstens schliesst er mit einem versöhnlichen Ausblick und einem Ratschlag an die etablierten Parteien: Lasst die Dinge, die ihr nicht versteht. Insgesamt bin ich froh, dass es noch solche Artikel gibt, da kann man wenigstens seine eigene Meinung revidieren.

We're talking about the *main body* of an entire field of science with tens of thousands of scientists in hundreds of independent research groups across dozens of countries! To universally question their integrity as money-grubbing fraudsters frankly boggles my mind. It's not about elections at all when it's distributed across the world where political winds don't blow left or right but all over the place like actual weather systems.

Consider just for a moment the premise that anthropogenic global warming is real. Which instance of power would be best suited to act in the interest of future generations on a global scale? A corporate billionaire here and there might see the big picture and drive his vision towards our general betterment, but he isn't the corporation, the corporation as an entity is motivated by its constituents' short-term needs to ensure growth and profit. And the day that all the corporations get together and announce that from hereon out the future of the species takes precedence over monetary gains is the day that I will eat my leather cap. You may hold me to that promise. 

A government on the other hand has within it the potential to represent all of our interests. Yes, that may be theoretical and ideal, but the potential is there nonetheless and the actualization of that potential is entirely reliant on how much importance the people electing the government puts on it. A nation gets the government it deserves, and if they feel the government is dysfunctional and acts through that assumption, a dysfunctional government is what they get.

Ultimately, the reason democracy works is because it's out of the hands of individuals. A well-functioning democratic election *is* society's self-decision. You may be right that the system has lead to an emergence of a politician class, but that *is also* society's decision. However, at least where I come from, there is a system of checks and balances that leads to inform the decision makers with the best, most objective knowledge to base their decisions on. We have one of the largest, most far-reaching governments in the world here in Denmark and by and large, people are pretty happy with it because they take an active interest in the way it is conducted.

Then there's a whole other discussion: why systems in universities are built to maximize scientific integrity and isn't deeply enmeshed with the political forces du jour.

&gt; France’s public prosecutor called for a full scale judicial inquiry into Lagarde’s involvement in the legal dispute between the business mogul Bernard Tapie and the French bank Credit Lyonnais. Tapie accused the bank, which was state-owned at the time, of misleading him while dealing with the sale of his Adidas shares in 1993. He sued the state for compensation, claiming the final sale price was higher than he had been led to believe. Credit Lyonnais, meanwhile, maintained that it had done nothing wrong. In 2007, Lagarde intervened to bring a swift end to the long-running battle. She offered to take it out of court by appointing a special panel of judges to arbitrate the case. The two-decade-long dispute ended a year later with a €285 million settlement in favour of the flamboyant tycoon.

http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fuckwad

&gt;A despicable person

Does a collaborator with an extreme right-wing government not fit this definition?

&gt;As i understand, this writer had streets named after him

So did [Ion Antonescu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Antonescu) until recently. Having streets named after questionable people is nothing new. Yesterday, a statue was unveiled in Bucharest for a poet that was a giant kiss-ass in the Ceaușescu regime. He was a good poet, but a shitty person. Just like Nyirő above.

&gt;And now suddenly he becomes a ""Nazi""?

Yes. A member of the [Szálasi regime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sz%C3%A1lasi_regime)'s parliament, „suddenly” became a Nazi in 2012.

&gt;Its the typical ""Hungarian card"" as currently played by Romanians

It wasn't the Romanians who decided it's a good moment right around elections to try to bury this fellow in Romania. It's clear scandal baiting, on the part of Szász Jenő:

&gt;Az újratemetést az Országgyűlés Hivatalának közreműködésével a *Szász Jenő, a Magyar Polgári Párt elnöke* vezette Székelyudvarhelyért Alapítvány szervezi.

But I do agree with the fact that the Romanian side overreacted. But it's election time, and the nationalist bruhaha might attract  some votes on both sides.

Also, another „Romanian” who thinks the fuckwad is a fascist: Frunda György

&gt;**Az a tény, hogy fasiszta volt**, az egészen más kérdés. De formálisan – és ez nem ügyvédi csűrés-csavarás – nem ítélték el. És ha a jóhiszeműség szabályaira hallgatunk, az, akit nem ítéltek el, az egy korrekt ember.

You can enhance your chance with a teaching english as foreign language (TEFL) qualification. 

You can work as teacher at a university, your linguistics degree could help you. I worked as a programmer for some semesters at a language dept. of a university, there are a lot of native speakers required each year to teach ""Sprachpraxis"". That are small seminars of 15-20 students which need some practical training. Sometimes the teachers (esp. eastern european languages) were students themselves, but native speakers. 

You can also work as a school teacher at international schools or schools with immersive english teaching. They are often interested in getting native speakers even when they have no teaching degree. However, you have to get along with children ;-)

There is a list of available jobs at universities at
http://www.hochschulstellenmarkt.de/hochschulstellen.html

If you want to go to Germany, keep the smaller universities in mind. There are a lot of foreigners in Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Cologne and Frankfurt, so it might be hard to get a Job with just a B.A. 

Have a look at Universities/Towns like Dresden, Leipzig, Chemnitz, Halle, Magdeburg, Jena, Weimar, Rostock and so on. There is a list at http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_deutscher_Hochschulen
