Il est hors de question de renier notre histoire et ce qui a participé à construire notre identité pour adapter la chose à des étrangers qui fuit leurs pays mais importent ce dont ils cherchent à s'échapper.

Non. Vous êtes catholiques si vous voulez, les français sont ce qu'ils veulent être. C'est ça la laïcité. ""La France catholique"", il faut aller expliquer ça aux protestants par exemple, et leur parler de la Saint Barthélémy. 

Personne ne renie votre histoire. Personne ne cherche à adapter quoique ce soit, c'est vous qui essayez d'imposer **votre** identité aux autres. C'est vous les agresseurs. Vous vous sentez catholiques, pas moi. Et je ne vois pas au nom de quoi vous allez venir m'expliquer quelle religion je dois adopter. C'est pourtant inscrit dans la Constitution :

&gt;La France est une République indivisible, laïque, démocratique et sociale. Elle assure l’égalité devant la loi de tous les citoyens sans distinction d’origine, de race ou de religion. Elle respecte toutes les croyances. Son organisation est décentralisée.

Vos revendications sont clairement antirépublicaines et anticonstitutionnelles. Ce n'est pas pour ça que je vais militer pour vous museler. Vous pouvez continuer à déblatérer vos idées rétrogrades et paradoxales.

Et ce n'est pas pour ça non plus que je veux déboulonner les innombrables symboles chrétiens qui jonchent la France. Je suis capable de visiter une cathédrale et de l'apprécier, je ne milite pas pour qu'on les détruise et qu'on chasse les catholiques de France. Je paie même des impôts qui servent probablement à la restauration de monuments religieux. Et tant mieux. Par contre, vous, vous cherchez à nuire aux autres.

Vous faîtes la distinction république / France quand ça vous arrange, par contre pour les étrangers, c'est la même chose, la république, la France et la nation ne doivent faire qu'un. Mais bon on est plus à une contradiction près.

&gt;Non, ce sont des personnels religieux, pas juste des fidèles.

Et alors ? Deux poids deux mesures. La laïcité à deux vitesses, la religion est OK pour les blancs, rien pour les autres.

&gt;Renseigne-toi sur l'histoire de France pour comprendre la raison de cela. Mais je pense que tu le sais déjà. Si ton but est de remarquer que la France est une terre catholique, ça fait quand même un paquet de siècles que c'est le cas.

Eh ben non justement, la France n'est pas une terre catholique. Les catholiques ont le droit de vivre en France au même titre que les fidèles des autres religions, et se plient aux règles de la république. Les catholiques n'ont pas droit à un traitement de faveur. Dans l'Histoire de France, il y a aussi la Déclaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen, la séparation de l'église et de l'état, la laïcité. Ca s'applique aussi aux catholiques.

I've seen short time workers fired (4 to 6 months), and it really isn't a big deal. People who work longer rarely give much of a reason to get fired, and they become harder to replace anyway because of their experience.

If anything the Greeks I meet tend to feel dwarfed by their past and the resulting culture without achievements of their own to match up. And that kind of sentiment is damaging to the individual and it often morphs to a false pride which is nothing more than a facade for one's, perceived or real, inefficiencies.

As a side-note, I do not preach under any circumstances that one should take _pride_ in his/hers nationality. After all what has one done to gain it? Be born in it? By the same measure should tall people feel proud to be tall? Of course one can feel _happy_ about the circumstances he/she was born in, but pride implies an accomplishment and none has actually taken place.

But you talk of other contemporary behaviors that I *do* know. And I have come across the ""μάγκες"" and the ""βολεμένους"" (street smart and comfortably settled, respectively). I won't argue their existence or their backwardness.

What I am arguing is their prevalence in our society. Be it due to where I fraternize, work or entertain myself I do not see those types all that often or at all.

Every culture is interesting, and has bright spots in it's history. It's not wrong to like your culture, the problem is in the extreme. When people get blinded, and start to take too much pride in something their forefathers did, and start belittling people from other cultures and places thinking their heritage makes them superior when it starts growing xenophobia, hatred and prejudice. It also makes them easy to manipulate.

These extreme sentiments tend to draw from history, and center on the bright spots, but not current events.

It depends on how high your standards are. My impression is that Serbia is an underachiever, it punches under its weight class.

&gt; Serbia does have a long history and a rich and colorful culture.

That's just a platitude. But what distinguishes Serbia from other nations? I can't think of anything on par with what you can find in US, UK, Russia, Germany, Greece or even Turkey. Do you think Serbia can compete with these nations? From a tourist perspective, why would someone visit Serbia over these nations? 

&gt; Every culture is interesting

OK, but I think some are more interesting than others. Let's say I want to visit a Slavic country, why should I pick Serbia over Russia? If you weren't Serbian but a Western tourist could you honestly say you would choose to visit Serbia before visiting Russia?

&gt; not wrong to like your culture, the problem is in the extreme.

I don't think that's wrong but on the grand scale I think the Serbian culture  is overshadowed by  more prestigious cultures.

&gt; These extreme sentiments tend to draw from history, and center on the bright spots, but not current events.

OK, but there aren't that many bright spot in Serbia's history, the Serbian star is much more dimmer than other stars in the night's sky. I think Serbian nationalists are delusional, you have to be  a Serb to say Serbia is a powerful nation but you don't have to be an American to say the same thing about US.

It's easy for sensationalist threads or comments to become popular simply by appealing to a vocal, extremist subset of subscribers, who might not actually contribute very much to the general life of the subreddit. So whenever there's an immigration themed thread, this minority of subscribers pile in, while the rest of the time they're not that interested. That's one way of explaining it without a propagandist conspiracy.

I'd also say that, although I'm an atheist, I think the New Atheism trend is dangerous, because it places objective judgement as a value above tolerance. So whereas the previous arguments focused on the necessity for a shared secular legal authority, and beyond that private lives were tolerated, the new emphasis puts more or less harmless activities under public scrutiny to be heavily criticized. So, for instance, there was a thread recently on /r/politics about the hijab (bearing in mind this is the headscarf, not the full face covering), where the comments came down heavily as saying that it was an unacceptable symbol of female subjugation, when to me it seems harmless.

true,metaleks,SERB,СРБИЈА,"&gt; This ties to my first point that the Serbian Empire wasn't really that powerful if it couldn't withstand the Ottoman onslaught.

Are you sure that you want to use the Ottoman empire as a litmus test for how powerful a nation is? Because many of the western nations you hold such a high opinion of would have crumbled had the Ottoman pushed far enough. It's kind of ironic, actually. If not for countries like Serbia that acted as gate keepers and made it more difficult for the Ottoman empire to expand, more of Europe would have been annexed. So, the next time we talk about Serbia's position in the world, let's not forget Serbia's unique predisposition.

&gt; No, but it wasn't that impressive either. At that time, the Ottoman Empire was the sick man of Europe.

So you don't find retaining culture and identity after hundreds of years to be impressive? I guess we'll have to agree to disagree about this.

&gt; Sure, Serbs managed to preserve ther identity, culture and religion but to what avail? What good come out of it? What's the point of preserving your culture if you build so little on top of it? Serbia takes baby step while the rest of Europe makes great strides forward. Isn't that disappointing?

Well, there is that little predisposition I mentioned earlier. I'm sure that stunted Serbia's growth to some extent. Around the time Serbia was finally free, countries like the UK were practically industrialized. Also, I would argue that preserving culture is an inherently worthwhile thing to do, but that's neither here nor there.

I do agree that when you put it like that, it's unfortunately disappointing, but this was the hand we were dealt with.

true,rabbitlion,SWED,Sweden,"Ok, so let's try to respond to most of what you said. First of all, I'm assuming the link you are talking about is http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/11t851/riot_at_a_swedish_film_screening_depicting/. Looking at it, I can see very few racist comments in the thread. Barely any at all, and most of them are downvoted. How did you arrive at the conclusion that /r/europe is an anti-islamic circlejerk from this? Was it the fact that the link itself got upvotes? Reddit links have a 90:10 upvote:downvote ratio in general. People always upvote a lot more than they downvote. I also think that many people who haven't seen this video before thought it was worth a watch.

&gt;Lately, this subreddit have seen a large influx of videos and links of this character. Posts that simply appeal to our bigotry, but hold no value in a rational discussion, nor is particularily related to Europe at all.

I really don't agree with this at all. If you're browsing the new queue you could be right, but every new queue is 90% if not 99% trash and bad posts gets downvoted and never rise. I could be wrong, maybe you could point out how many anti-islamic propaganda you can see at http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=month, the most upvoted links from the last month.

&gt;What i have also noticed, is that it seems to be becoming socially acceptable to be bigoted and prejudice in this subreddit. A while back, there was a post about a gang of youths gang-raping a french girl. The comment section was filled with comments who, without any evidence whatsoever, immediately blamed the Muslims.

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by no evidence. Mainstream media like The Guardian will rarely publish identities or say anything about the race or religion of criminals. That doesn't mean the information isn't out there. This guy, http://gaelle.hautetfort.com/archive/2010/02/20/mahamadou-doucoure-etait-deja-accuse-de-viols-collectifs.html (in french but google translate works good enough) was the leader of the gang. Most posts in the comment thread here on reddit is actually keeping a decent tone. Except your ones of course. You immediately accuse people who say they were Muslims of being racists and bigots. Why are people assuming they are Muslims bigots, but when you assume people say that without knowing it you're not?

I'm not gonna talk much about /r/atheism, except to say that it's mostly a humor subreddit. You might not like their jokes, but the subreddit isn't really meant to be taken seriously.

Regarding flashback.org, it has definitely not been taken over by an anti-Islamic circlejerk. The forums has something like a hundred sections, and only a few are dominated by these people. Maybe you hang out in those sections all day getting trolled, but the rest of the forums are very healthy and sometimes interesting (the lack of a post voting system hurts after using reddit though). The sections that have been overrun are in a pretty terrible state, I'll agree on that. The issue, as others in this thread have pointed out, is that it's impossible to debate immigration in public without risking your reputation and career. This has the very obvious and natural result of making these people shy away and stick to each other instead. This is definitely a problem, but it is NOT the fault of the racists or the people who are just against immigration. The problem lies with the way the establishment drives these people away and the mainstream media shames them into the shadows. Once they are only among themselves, they will never be exposed to any differing opinions and slowly circlejerk themselves deeper and deeper until they are no longer even receptive to anything else.

&gt;This sort of behaviour is extremely devastating, since it makes it completely impossible to hold civilized discussions. And i feel that it is in a similar direction that this subreddit is heading, when anybody who posts anti-muslim propaganda is celebrated, and anyone who opposes, regardless of how constructive or rational they are, get downvoted.

The thing with votes on reddit is that they are never indicative of the entire userbase. They only represent the views of people who came to the comments section. If you feel a particular thread has become too racist-circlejerky, just downvote everything and move on. If a bunch of anti-Islamists are arguing in a thread and you jump in and say ""hey guys stop being so racist and anti-islamic"", what do you think is going to happen. Most likely these people don't identify themselves as racists (I won't pass judgment on who's right) so they're going to downvote you for calling them that. If someone called you a racist you would downvote them too. Of course in the end there's also going to be some sensible people coming along the thread, but they'll also downvote you just because you complain about downvotes all the fucking time. Just let people vote however they feel man, it's really the only democracy we have on reddit.

&gt;We must be better at distinguishing propaganda from something that actually holds a value for a discussion. Of course we should discuss islam, if it is relevant. The protests against the muhammed video held discussional value. But we shouldn't just post videos of muslims being generally stupid like the above mentioned video. It contributes nothing and serves only to damage the quality of the subreddit.

I'm pretty sure Islam is very relevant to this thread, but still you keep posting asking people not to discuss here. Why not take one of the very few chances you will get at actually discussing with some of the more rational anti-Islamists when you get it? Where else should we discuss it? Clearly the riot video comments thread is no good, and it's not like you posted even one Islam discussion thread. You're also free to post videos of Muslims acting exemplary, so why not do that instead of whining about everyone else's posts?",0,1350958354,null,0,false,0,c6qbh2x,t3_11w8lc,t1_c6qbh2x,t3_11w8lc,null,1430214548,18,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,18

true,bunburya,IREL,Hibernia,"The more you act like this is some massive scourge that is taking over /r/Europe, the more you exacerbate the problem. Honestly, I don't like it any more than you do, but it is much more rare than you are making out. Right now on the front page of /r/Europe there are no Muslim-bashing threads that I can see. The large majority of threads here are about the financial crisis, then there are the usual themes of UK-EU relations, separatist movements etc which comprise a large portion of the remainder.

If you're finding anti-Muslim hatred every time you come into /r/Europe, then you must be actively seeking it. And if not, then you are characterising the entire subreddit by reference to the occasional distasteful thread. I think there is a lot of undue pessimism about this subreddit. Most of the links are interesting and relevant and most of the discussion is still of a much higher quality than you will find elsewhere on Reddit.

When you act like this entire subreddit has turned into one giant hate-filled circlejerk, you do it a great disservice, because it is quite possible that people see your thread, think ""shit, I don't want to be a part of that"" and leave before really checking out what /r/Europe has to offer. Or maybe subscribers see threads like this, perceive the problem as being worse than it is and then unsubscribe. Both of these things only serve to increase the proportion of trolls and bigots posting in this subreddit.

Don't get me wrong, I don't like to see this stuff in /r/Europe either. I think we should all make an effort to downvote this kind of content, and I think the mods should be more aggressive in banning blatant trolls. But another thing which I think is crucially important to maintaining the quality of this subreddit is for reasonable people not to unsubscribe or stop participating.

I guess this kind of thing is to be expected after the massive riots over that movie and the dissapointment over the Arab Spring, and obviously the history between Muslims and Christian Europe has never been very good. Islam's expansion into Europe and with the capture of historically important Christian cities like Constantinople have left a major impact on most Europeans.

I get that people in highly developed nations don't like seeing refugees and poor immigrants practicing alien religions. It's to be expected. I mean, it is human nature after all.

Yet you have to admit, the West has benefited greatly from religious fundamentalism and tribalism across the Islamic world. The inherent weaknesses of most Islamic majority regimes have allowed for outright imperialism and colonization during the 19th century and economic domination during the 20th century. For the last one hundred years, much of the Middle East has supplied the West with cheap fossil fuels that will never be replaced in the lifetime of humanity, and often the profits from energy have gone into buying foreign (often Western) commodities and hiring foreigners for infrastructure projects.

I'm not saying that Muslims aren't at fault. Obviously leaders in the Islamic world have squandered many opportunities to become self reliant world powers with educated populations. Secular dictators and kings have failed to offer reforms for fear of losing power and fundamentalists have simply anchored the development of Muslim nations. Yet, Westerns have had their hand in this too.

At the end of the day, Europe has a future. This notion and fears of ""Eurabia"" is nonsensical. Austerity and this deepening economic crisis is going to eventually prompt an end of mass Muslim immigration to Europe. I imagine by the end of this century when climate change will begin turning much of the Middle East into uninhabitable dead zones and the extraction of oil declines and then collapses, Muslim nations are going to see a return to nomadism and other basic forms of survival. We're seeing it already in places like the Tigris-Euphrates river system in Iraq. This is the final chapter of our history.

So, for those of you who don't like Muslims; you can take solace in the likelihood that Islam will not threaten your way of life in any meaningful way in the future. 

You should be thankful to live in such well developed nations even in this time of austerity. My own homeland has been completely crushed economically and spiritually thanks to many decades of civil war and foreign meddling.

As for what kind of heater, I'd advise against getting those cheap fan heaters. They're loud, they leave parts of your room cold, and are a fire hazard. I personally have a small radiator in my room and it works great. It's nearly completely silent (a couple clicks when the thermostat kicks in and out, that's it). As long as you have an enclosed space you want to heat and can keep the door closed, it keeps the room nice and toasty.

It is very unpleasant, especially when this impacts your children. The more ""rural""  the area, the more prejudice the people have  against foreigners.

Given that you are from Australia (and assuming you are a girl), I would rank you on a 2/5 on the Germans' rasism scale (5 being the worst). Why? These things will raise your acceptance (a) an english accent (b) being a girl (c) because you come from a ""first world"" non-Muslim country, (d) you emotions, manners, mimic and attire are more common to Germans, than say, the ones of an Arab (e) you skin color is fairly light.

If you go here: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/crime/data/database

And check what we're really interested in, homicides per city (2nd publication).

So let's take that.

Let's take a city roughly the same size as Bucharest, 2 million people give or take... say.. Brussels.

Surely Brussels should be a very safe city, seeing as it's how THE very symbol of western Europe, harboring so many high-ranking politicians and European institutions.

Well, crime in Brussels (homicides) are higher than Bucharest.
It's too bad these statistics don't go up until current year, because like I said in my previous comment, it was in the last 2-3 years that violence increased in the west and decreased slightly in the East.

Maybe it's more of an increase in the west, due to the whole civil unrest, immigration policies, financial crisis and everything. Nonetheless, my point still stands. east Europe is slowly becoming safer than the west, regardless of the reasons.

And I'll tell you something else, which nobody likes, not even me although I'm visibly biased towards east Europe. That's no reason to like what I'm about to say:

east is often accused of not being oh so... free, but there's actually a catch there... you see, it is because of communism, people fear being silenced once again, and are against any kind of censorship much more than the west, and are being vocal about it.

I've only discovered this by living for a few years in a western european country. I've noticed that, because of political correctness, I can't really say anything about what bothers me.

I can't really say that there's a problem with immigration, because I'm a racist.

I can't really say that I think there's a problem with integrating the muslim culture and that we should really find alternate solutions and work harder, because well, I'm also a racist.

It seems to me that the west has forgotten what racism means, and has forgotten that we, the european people, have rights too.

you don't see that in the east, and newspapers are more free. I don't care what the statistics say, all you have to do as a human being is pick-up a newspaper and read it for a couple of days until some sensitive issue arises. you'll soon notice how journalism is still journalism in the east, and it still answers the who, when, where, why, how - as where in other countries in the west, they are self-regulating tighter and tighter and are increasingly afraid of publishing anything that's even close to being sensitive.

For example Sweden (any swede please feel free to correct me).

You go on these newspapers like dn.se or aftonbladet.se and start reading about some crime that happened in Stockholm. it's a rape, again.

and they just go saying: well, in the neighborhood of (insert bad viewed neighborhood full of immigrants here) there has been a rape.

and that's pretty much everything you can get out of the story. They don't say who did it, where exactly, how it happened, how old was he, is he a swedish citizen, etc... nothing. 

But here's the catch: They only hold back this information if: A) He's either black or middle eastern or B) he's a muslim.

god forbids he's swedish (not ethnic) or eastern european. in these cases they will tell you everything from age, height, shoe size, skin color and what he had for breakfast.

This is really frustrating, because everyone knows that, by default, if the perpetrator is not made known, then he's a muslim or a black immigrant - and that's bad, because by doing this, they don't protect them, they instead put all of them in the same pot so to speak.

it's not a good media practice to lump them together. I have plenty of muslim and black friends who are downright pissed by this, and the censorship goes on, because someone thought it's politically correct not to show crimes committed by people of those origins or religions.

it's actually more damaging not to show them. just treat them like everyone else.

discrimination here is now rampant to the other extreme: we're so 'tolerant' that we're ignoring them completely... it's just mind-boggling what's happening, and what's even more infuriating is that nobody is doing anything about it or saying anything, out of fear of not being labeled a racist.

whoa... how the hell did I get here?

We should avoid upvoting content which doesn't bring anything potentially constructive to the table, and avoid downvoting content which does, simply because we disagree with it.

r/atheism is a subreddit much more suitable for posts of this kind, where there are no discussional values desired.


Very many of those who oppose the immigration excuse their, to me, radical views on the internet by claiming that there is nowhere else for them to discuss immigration.
Yet they act very bad and tend to insult people, just like you just did, who try to debate immigration with them. Ofcourse nobody wants to debate with them, if they refuse to listen to any sort of reasoning and insults anyone who tries to.

If you want people to openly discuss immigration, then they must also be allowed to do so without being insulted or downvoted, simply because you disagree with them. You must also listen to what they have to say, which it is obvious that you have not done. And you must also allow yourself to open your mind to rationally layed out opinions which differ from yours, which is just what this thread is about.

The thinking behind these quotas is that perhaps in some cases there are vicious circles that cannot be broken without some kind of temporary affirmative action.

I'll tell you the thinking behind the boardroom proposals here. The idea is that although women are doing very well at lower level positions, the boardroom is still a very male-dominated affair. Getting to top management positions relies heavily on networking and getting to know other top managers. This is actually more difficult for women, since men often do networking in male-orientated situations like golf courses etc. Also it is difficult for women to network too closely with individual men without there appearing to be some kind of sexual element to it.

I don't know if I have made a very clear argument, but the point is that it may be a Catch 22 situation - in order to get more women into the boardroom we need more women in the boardroom.

Each owns his gondola, and each one is made in Italy. Of course there are new bridges made of stone rather than wood (since the 1600's), but like Texas in the U.S., the Venetians remain proud and somewhat separate.

Furthermore, it diminishes the achievements of those who attain the position without a quota, or at least brings in to question the ability of a candidate who may be perceived as being there simply to fill the quota. 

There are many more cultural reasons for women not being better represented on boards namely that a career break due to pregnancy is viewed negatively. 

Networking is important but it does not require a quota, simply funding or providing better opportunities for women would be a start. Also, how many women are applying for directorships? Going by the old chestnut of anecdote I know women tend to be quite common in law firms as senior or partner lawyers.

I'm currently studying for an MBA and funnily enough the course director and head of the business school is female as are a lot of the staff. However, in terms of the course it's pretty much a 70:30 split in favour of men. Why aren't more women doing an MBA?

Every international instution we join (from the UN and NATO to UNESCO and the Nordic Council) restricts our independence in some way and the EEA and Schengen treaties *severely* restrict our independence in ways which many EU opponents think would only come about with EU membership. Every little international treaty we sign (e.g. the recent Search and Rescue in the Arctic treaty) restrict our independence. The mere fact that there are other nations in the world restricts our freedom of action - as unless we are the most powerful nation in the world we don't want to do anything someone might do back at us...

Because eschewing meritocracy has poor results regardless of the reasons behind it.

I work in a field that has been traditionally seen as male-dominated. Not all my colleagues are men, and of the candidates we interview, the ratio of well-prepared candidates we'd love to hire reported to the ratio of poorly-prepared people we turn down is about the same for both men and women.

On the other hand, the number of female candidates we get is low; the proportion of women who graduate as specialists in this field is low, the proportion of female students in this field (and in our particular niche) is low and so on. Bottom line is, very few women show up for interviews, and if we had to meet a quota, we could end up hiring candidates we would otherwise turn down. Not because women are too stupid or too weak to be engineers, but because if the quota is too high, it may simply amount to more women than otherwise show up for the interviews!

Yes, there is always that danger: ""policy-driven evidence"" rather than ""evidence-driven policy"". That is exactly why we should look at objective research, rather than arguing on one side or the other without looking at the evidence.

Actually they mention that because they claim to have fixed the shortcomings of those previous studies.

* If you get a guidebook, Rick Steve's is pure gold.
* If you want to feel like you're in Italy, walk through smaller cities and towns eating gelato instead of walking through a bustling crowd of tourists with a camera around your neck. Still take pictures, though.
* Don't eat anything off the main thoroughfare: take a side street, go off the beaten path. It'll seem more authentic (and probably will be), you'll get better service, and a better price.
* I fell in love with the Bay of Naples and the Amalfi Coast. Not sure what your transportation costs would be, but once there it's cheap bus fare to Positano or Amalfi, the hostels there are CHEAP, and that shoreline with the small towns and boardwalks is one of the most romantic places I've ever been, definitely beats the Galapagos and the beaches of Costa Rica, anyway
* speaking of hostels, use hostelworld.com and if you have time to plan ahead, airbnb.com has some gems
* Can't say enough about a hike through Cinque Terre. That itself costs under 10 euro, but getting there and finding a hostel is what will take time. Personally I find that an enjoyable, beautiful hike is a great way to get closer to someone you already know..it's enjoyable bonding more than a date. But you'll never forget it.
* Cheese. Beautiful cheese. I got spoiled while I was there; not really a suggestion but make sure you appreciate the good stuff if you are so inclined! I don't drink, but the wine culture is also really accessible if that's more your style.

They can change their district (if they moved nearby) in the same municipality, or municipality (if they moved in another city), but they are already in the national register and an electoral number has been assigned to them. The only difference with cops is that they are excluded from voting in the special stations, if they opt to vote in regular stations in their local municipality. In order to avoid voting twice, they surrender their special ID.

That is game over for the economy.

Now the reason why Latvians have taken so many Euro denominated loans is because Latvia like other developing economies is a capital poor country. That means that Latvian state can't shut-down foreign capital out of the country, because then there would be no capital fund future growth.

The good thing about joining the Euro is that it will remove currency risks associated with foreign capital, all those loans denominated in Euro will now be free of currency risk. Removal of this risk will also increase stability of the local market which will in time allure more foreign capital and investors in to the country.

P.S. Do remember that even bigger and more developed economies have played themselves out of the markets, Finland, Sweden and UK were all out speculated in the beginning of 90s.

What we see here is that enhanced co-operation between Member States as prescribed in Art. 20 TEU in conjunction with Arts. 326 &amp;327 TFEU is used. The legal basis for harmonization of taxation on which the proposal is based is art. 113 TFEU which warrants unanimity in the Council (i.a. the UK is vetoing the proposal). Interesting is to see is the measure may be contested by financial institutions situated in the region of the Member States introducing the financial transaction tax. Art. 114 TFEU gives the Union the power to act on securing the proper functioning of the internal market. The 'proper functioning' may be undermined by the regional application of the financil transaction tax in the member States adopting the measure under the enhanced cooperation procedure. Can the financial institutions or any individual whose rights are impeded contest the measure? Indivuduals (legal or natural) only have a very limited access to the CJEU (Court of Justice of the EU) under Art. 263(4) TFEU (see the Article for the three possible grounds). Following the Courts' jurisprudence in 'Plaumann' it can be held that individuals might not have standing before the CJEU. The individuals may go to national courts if there is an implementation measure. The national court may (under their own motion) ask for a preliminary ruling pursuant to Art. 267 TFEU. The national Court could ask the CJEU about the legality of the Financial Transaction Tax. In both cases the main argument would be that there is a distortion of the proper functioning of the internal market since financial institutions in one place are treated in a differetn and detrimental way as opposed to financial institutions in Member States not levying the financial transaction tax.
My main point here is: Who profits? In my opinion the countries who do not apply the financial transaction tax, especially the UK, profit. London will probably see and influx and growth in the banking sector concerning the activities which fall under the financial transaction tax due to the 'migration' of the sectoral businesses. 
So should we not adopt the measure? The argument of regional enactment of the measure is always contested, be it at Union level with all 27 Member States or with only 10. Emigration of financial activities to less regulated areas is therefore always a problem. Should that keep us from adoptin the measure? I think NO. Why? The EU has, for example, already acted as a leader in the field climate law with the EU emissions tradinf scheme and the effort sharing decision in relation with the goals of the Kyoto Protocol and the UNFCCC. Here, the EU used its economic influence to affect third countries by way of regulatory penalty default. In short, the EU incentivizes third countries by 'stick' and 'carrot' to adopt its rules concerning climate protection. If this were applied to the financial sector it may also work, notwithstanding the influence of the international banking sector (climate change has its 'enemy' in multinational corporations and this has worked to a good extent). However, the lack of unity in the EU may significantly affect the application of the financial transaction tax in the detriment of its global effect.

""Afghan-American here. I'm not a practicing Muslim but I've been browsing reddit for a few months now and I do frequent r/Europe. I guess this kind of thing is to be expected after the massive riots and failures of the Arab Spring to generate liberal democracies, and obviously the history between Muslims and Christian Europe has never been very good. Islam's expansion into Europe and with the capture of historically important Christian cities like Constantinople have left a major impact on most Europeans.

I get that people in highly developed nations don't like seeing refugees and poor immigrants practicing alien religions and commiting crimes. It's to be expected. I mean, it is human nature after all.

Yet you have to admit, the West has benefited greatly from religious fundamentalism and tribalism across the Islamic world. The inherent weaknesses of most Islamic majority regimes have allowed for outright imperialism and colonization during the 19th century and economic domination during the 20th century. For the last one hundred years, much of the Middle East has supplied the West with cheap fossil fuels that won't be replaced in our lifetimes, and often the profits from energy have gone into buying foreign (often Western) commodities and hiring foreigners for infrastructure projects.

I'm not saying that Muslims aren't at fault. Obviously leaders in the Islamic world have squandered many opportunities to become self reliant world powers with educated populations. Secular dictators and kings have failed to offer reforms for fear of losing power and fundamentalists have simply anchored the development of Muslim nations. Yet, Westerns have had their hand in this too.

You see, Europe has a future. This notion of ""Eurabia"" is nonsensical. Austerity and this deepening economic crisis is going to eventually prompt and end of Muslim immigration to Europe. I imagine by the end of this century when climate change will begin turning much of the Middle East into uninhabitable dead zones and the extraction of oil declines and then collapses, Muslim nations are going to see a return to nomadism and other basic forms of survival. We're seeing it already in places like Iraq, and the gradual loss of the Tigris-Euphrates river system in Iraq and southern marshes. 

So, for those of you who don't like Muslims; you can take solace in the likelihood that Islam will not threaten your way of life in any meaningful way in the future.

You should be thankful to live in such well developed nations even in this time of austerity. My own homeland has been completely crushed economically and spiritually thanks to many decades of foreign meddling. When there is so little to look forward to in the living world, god is all one can hope for. ""

Anecdotally, it's the same reason the Americans are hesitant to reform, although it's less pronounced. There are many, although not all, unjustified fears about health related issues, there is the idea that it would result in a degeneration of society, concerns about children, and a general reluctance which can't quite be articulated. 

However, if this post is any indication, a significant reason is that people don't think it's important and aren't involved in the issue. The status quo is maintained because it's not on people's mind. When it is challenged, the existing support structure for the non-legal status is able to ward off any debate. There is a real difficultly changing laws when people respond with ""it's not an important issue"" and decide to completely ignore the issue.

however, as for your point, there are a few areas which have de-facto legalised. I haven't been following the news recently, but I believe there are a few cantons in Switzerland which have legalised personal production. There were areas in Spain thinking about legalisation, although I recall failed attempts. For your point about being progressive, I'm going to conjecture and actually say, at least for the drug reform groups, America and Canada are for more advanced. I wouldn't be surprised if legalisation happened over here before in Europe.

Even though Kokoomus had done many of the same tricks (sometimes even more blatantly!), they never really got thrown into mud and even became the biggest party in the following election.

The reason why Kokoomus did not take as much hit was in the fact that they just weren't as crooked. Only person from Kokoomus who was deeply involved in the scandal was Marja Tiura, and she was taken through the mud just like everyone else involved. Kokoomus eas not involved in anything on the magnitude of Nuorisosäätiö (criminal activity), or the snowmobile factory like the Center Party did. 

In the end, the media did a shitty job as a whole on the scandal as they completely missed the real point of the scheme: to pay money to people who decide on land zoning (who also, outside of larger cities, are mostly from Center Party). They were not trying to buy out members of parliament, they were buying people who were able to affect the zoning on a local level who just also happened to run for parliament.

&gt;SDP/union connection was nothing new - SDP had already lost the previous election partially because SAK had been supporting the party a little too directly. Perhaps you remember this?

&gt;It might not be very fun, but the left wing/union had always been pretty above table in how they handled the funds, so there wasn't really anything ""GOTCHA!""-worthy -- at best SDP could say that ok, perhaps this is a bit old-fashioned, but it isn't like we tried to hide it.

I still say majority of the people are completely oblivious to the fact that leftist parties are effectively funded through tax deductions. That is a huge anger bomb right there that the media decided never to exploit.

&gt;But good example of right-leaning bias can be seen in Guggenheim, which was opposed by left but celebrated by right -- and HS. Or ""consumption taxes"" that are enthusiastically pushed by Greens, Kokoomus and HS - and nobody else.

It's happening in the United States, with power constantly switching from those that want to see the States have more power, to those who want the Federal Government to have more power.

In Belgium, you have those parties that favour greater regional autonomy, and those that oppose it.

And in Europe, you have those that favour an all-powerful Central European Government, and those that believe more power should rest with the Nation States.

And just as it's not un-American to favour more State power, it's not necessarily Nationalistic to believe that Nation States should have more power within the EU.

I want to leave the United Kingdom because Westminster is currently filled with politicians with little to no support here in Scotland and they're inflicting policy on us. That's a problem that can be fixed with devolution. I support *independence* because I'm concerned by the UK's foreign policy, which you can't realistically devolve; I don't want Westminster to call the shots on the Scots' EU membership or currency.

I think a European state could see a lot of benefits, especially if it had the budget to implement state-wide policies and measures. Imagine a single rail organisation, run by the European Union government, that provided a service all around Europe. A consistent, reliable, affordable service (the first three are unlikely with a privatised system, especially since current EU countries award contracts to random companies, not all the same). That'd be pretty stellar. And more funding to systems like Erasmus and so forth... ah, it'd be lovely.

It's not a realistic dream today; not with so much wealth inequality, ideological schisms, and a heightened level of Euroscepticism. It's weird, actually, that a lot of problems in the EU right now (like the Eurozone crisis) could be solved by tightening regulations across the EU, but the problems themselves are giving people cold feet and they want to retreat instead.

Like I said: it's idealistic, and I would only support it if we can bring about the end of so many ideological schisms.

Lots of things in Europe are changing.

That's my key criterion, though: more than a few degrees of agreement between the states. It might work better if it starts with fewer countries, such as those just in the north-west (incl. Germany, France, British Isles).

true,mrrossi79,,Cologne,"It really depends on what you expect from German culture and the 'typical' people.
I think for taking the most interesting pictures of the 'natives' here try to visit the small villages were no tourists are. If you want the typical stereotypes of what half the world thinks Germans would look like, visit Bavaria and the many very typical villages there. Munich for example is a wonderful big city  but the people there look just like every other people in every big city in Germany. Except the folks that wear their Trachten just for the tourists and get payed by the city or the Brauhaus for looking like what people think they should look like.
If you want to see another side of Germany take a trip to the many German Islands in the north which are unfortunately very touristic, but from here you can plan some short trips to other villages in the north, you will see completely different people there.   Every bigger city will most likely be very boring for you, since people there are the same as everywhere else. 
If you love bigger city's and modern life, Berlin is the place to go, I really hate this town and dislike the way people behave there but from a photographers point of view it's perfect since you will find everything. 
Carnival in Cologne will give you the opportunity to take breathtaking, beautiful and/or disgusting pictures of dancing drinking celebrating happy puking people in disguise. 
Just Like Munich, Cologne outside of carnival season will give you the opportunity to take wonderful  pictures of japanese tourists.

But! ...
..be careful we German people are sometimes extremely strange when it comes to our rights not to appear in other people's photographs. 
As a photographer which is specialized on people, I'm sure you will have some talent in talking to people and convince them to be Ok with the pictures taken of them.
If you want to make money with the photographs by publishing them, it would be necessary to get a signed paper from the guys you take pictures of. It's difficult to just download an universal template because it really should be specific to your purposes.
There comes the next problem most people will have no problem to be photographed but won't sign anything. 
I've come to the conclusion that doing street photography is technically impossible if you want to do it completely and perfectly legal, even if you manage it to do so, after publishing a book of your photos you are not saved from someone revoking the permission to publish it. 
Somehow you are always the one risking it, you can risk it and the chances are really really really small to get any problems, but when you do you will have barely a chance in court.

Let's see.

1. Making sure the EU stays together and no one leaves

2. Resolving the economic crisis

Those will do for now. For the future

3. A unified military force. This will cut costs for all, as well as make us more capable in peace missions.

4. A unified police force. This will make it harder for criminals to simply go to another country and avoid persecution. This has become necessary due to the Schengen agreement.

This is very similar to the behaviour of people from another big subreddit, r/atheism. A Place completely void of any rational thinking or constructive discussion. You either agree, or you get ""removed"". A behaviour which also holds similarities with the Muslim extremists who cannot tolerate any opinion other than their own. 


Oh *bullshit*. I like the rest of your post but this is so blatantly wrong it's not even funny anymore. Do you have RES? It shows how many up and downvotes each post and thread has. So many threads at the top are completely torn, split practically in two in the votes. Same with comments. YES, a lot of anti-Islam exists, but no, you do not get removed unequivocally. 

Look for example at [this string of posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/11t1le/muslim_rapes_2_year_old_because_father_refuses_to/c6pfzwo?context=3). Unfortunately for me the main thread itself is 73% agreed with, but you can see in the votes on these comments that there is a lot of division in opinion. 

Also, /r/atheism is usually singled out for such an example, quite undeservedly in my opinion. Just look at the even more mainstream subreddit /r/politics. For example; [this baloney post](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11sky1/america_please_explain_to_me_how_mitt_romney_has/c6p8v8k) completely disregarding facts and context for a small victory point.",0,1351027043,null,0,1351027257,0,c6qpttr,t3_11w8lc,t1_c6qpttr,t3_11w8lc,null,1430221394,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,I_read_a_lot,null,null,"1. Italy is not really a socialist country, but it depends on the meaning of ""socialism"" for him. Some things in Italy are under control of the State: healthcare (but you also have private medical cabinets, and you can use your State-provided coverage for private consultations for little or no money, it depends on your income), water supply (although is generally owned by the individual communes or provinces), and a few other things. A lot has been totally or partially privatized during the past 20 year, like the postal service, telecom, electricity. We don't have multiple choices for health insurance. Every Italian citizen has the right to medical care, backed by the State.
2. No. The downfall of the Italian economy was a combination of factors, including exceedingly high debt (due to a period of hyperinflation during the '80s in order to keep our economy afloat), bad politics, bad industry, exhaustion of resources (gas in the north, in particular), poor infrastructure, insanable red-tape, huge cost of an inefficient public administration, huge and untouchable caste of lawyers, poor work market and legislation, endemic corruption, brain drain, anti-intellectualism, rejection of technology and progress, waste of money on useless projects, most often left unfinished to rot, or with money disappearing in some foreign bank account. Italy has also a very bad distribution of wealth.
3. Our health system is rather good, compared to the healthcare of other european countries. The worst are the nordic ones. The French is the absolute best. Italy is rather ok, with our only problem being mostly old infrastructure (hospitals) and reduction of personnel due to cuts of funding, but overall I've seen and heard of much worse around the rest of Europe.
4. It's inefficient due to red-tape and poor investment in modernization. This is due to inefficient allocation of money, or disappearance of it.
5. I don't know what's the tax rate for Retirees, but it's not 68%. Also, I think that as a retiree, you basically get like 80 % of what you earned before retiring, or something like that. Our pension system is a bit fucked, but for other reasons (mostly due to general longevity, poor administration and lack of coverage of current pension investment from young workforce).

So, overall, your man knows very little of Italy, and he can be considered as an uninformed troll. Also, I don't really mind living in a Socialist state (not a communist one), as long as I get what I pay for. Some services should be public, some others should be private. I consider some services to be a fundamental right of the citizen to give him peace of mind for worst case scenarios. Healthcare and pension are among them.

Some of his claim may arise from the fact that the socialist party (and in particular its secretary, Bettino Craxi) was mainly composed of thieves who stole insane amounts of public money until the beginning of the '90s, when this was discovered during the so-called ""Mani pulite"" (tidy hands) period. In reality, the socialist party was not the only one stealing. All of them were, all across the parliament, and still do.

&gt; Berlin (dpa) - One in 20 people in Germany are unable to pay bills on time or skip meals due to poverty, data released on Tuesday showed, as the European Union takes stock of its progress on poverty.

&gt; Around 5.3 per cent of the population live in deprivation, defined by European statisticians as being too poor to pay the rent on time, to eat meat at least every second day or to buy a car, washing machine or colour television.

&gt; Including those at serious risk of poverty, the figure rises to 12.8 million people, or 15.8 per cent of the German population, according to data released a week ago, despite their country‘s strong economic growth.

&gt; German statisticians interviewed a cross-section of 13,500 households last year to ask what they can afford and discover if incomes from work, welfare and pensions suffice.

&gt; Poverty was defined as meeting at least four of nine criteria.

&gt; The data was fed into an EU-wide survey of social progress in 2011, but the comparative picture from other member states was not yet available.

&gt; Although Germany so far has been less affected by the recession that has hit much of the eurozone, its poorest have seen little benefit from economic growth. Chancellor Angela Merkel last week voiced alarm that the poor lack adequate pension plans for old age.

&gt; Germany‘s definition of poverty is well above the World Bank and UN definition of having less than 1.25 dollars daily to live.

&gt; Anti-poverty campaigners say the German poor may not starve, but they suffer from outcast status and lower life expectancy.

Goddamnit stop simplifying history. Turkey didn't ""steal"" Constantinople, Turkey didn't even exist then as a modern nation state. It was the Ottoman Empire. Neither did Greece existed, it was the Eastern Roman Empire (later called by historians Byzantine), a multicultural and multiethinc empire. Nation and states weren't a reality back then, people identified more by their religion if anything else. In school they probably told you that the Byzantine Empire was Greece but that is totally wrong. Yes Greek was the official language of the empire and the culture was heavily influenced by Greek civilization and the empire had a big percentage of population that spoke Greek and was of the Orthodox Christian religion but these people didn't even had the notion of nations in their heads. If anything they were the subjects of an emperor. Please stop interpreting history based on today's world which is based on nation-states. Nation-states are a very new political formation in the hundred of thousands years of human history. The basis of your logic is totally false, you speak of Turkey like it ""stole"" something you owned which is the most absurd way of viewing history.

There are hundreds of arguments on why Turkey maybe shouldn't join the EU and they have to do with politics and human rights and better use those if you want to strengthen your argument and not ""Turks stole our beautiful land!"", people are just going to laugh at you, seriously. Start by reading some history and not by Paparigopoulos - or even worse by Velopoulos and Liakopoulos types.

edit: By ""stealing"" I was referring to Constantinople. But because I see you also call the occupation of Cyprus ""stealing"" let me tell you that a big responsibility in that happening (if not the biggest) was of the Greek military junta because they also tried to impose a same regime there too. Back then the powers guaranteeing for Cyprus (which I don't know if you are forgetting consists of both Greek-speaking AND Turkish-speaking Cypriots) were three: England, Greece and Turkey. Based on international politics Turkey would be stupid not to invade when the Greek junta was actually trying to take over the island. I am not speaking pro the Turkish invasion, or saying that it is still OK the island to be in this situation, I am analyzing the political circumstance and I am saying you are again simplifying events, events where also Greece (the stupid colonels that ruled Greece then anyway) had a big responsibility.",0,1351032985,null,0,1351033952,0,c6qrgj1,t3_11xvcc,t1_c6qrgj1,t1_c6qn3c4,null,1430222163,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

This is ingrained into German culture against any minority, not generally based on race but even social or outward appearance.

I'm German, but have live in the UK since I was two, every time I visit the region where me and my family originate from, I experience some weirdness due to not being a 'local'.

The Alps are, in my opinion,the best part of France. I admit I'm biased, seeing as I lived outside of Grenoble for five years, but I've been all over France and that hasn't changed my opinion.

Hiking and biking - doesn't get any better than in the mountains - as long as you're okay with having your ego hurt a little bit by seeing 80 year old men and women trucking along at twice your pace. The people there are in general extremely nice and polite - whenever I was walking the family dog and passed by a local, a friendly ""Bonjour"" was expected.  It's a region steeped in history. Castles are literally everywhere.

Honestly you could spend an action packed few months there and never feel the need to leave, but traveling around the country is easy from here as well. Switzerland is a mere hour and a half drive away (Geneva is a gorgeous city, though I've never felt there's much to do there other than walk around). The southern coast is 2 to 3 hours, making both great for day or weekend trips. TGV station in Grenoble makes the entire country easily accessible.

The skiing is phenomenal, with virtually endless options. My family lived on the Route de Chamrousse so I skied there mostly, but Alpes D'Huez, Les Sept Laux, Les Deux Alpes, and Les Trois Vallees are also excellent options.

As for schools, there are plenty of great options. I don't know how familiar you are with the school system over there, but one thing worth keeping in mind is that if a school is Catholic, this means it is automatically private. Private schools are catholic schools, but this doesn't necessarily mean your children will be receiving a catholic education. I attended two different schools in France, both catholic, and I didn't feel that I had a religious education at all, other than the occasional (and I mean extremely occasional) prayer.

Tu pourrais me la citer, s'il te plaît ? 

À mon avis, ceux qui pensent et réfléchissent, avancent des arguments, etc., ne le font (majoritairement) pas par haine, ou peur des personnes homosexuelles. En réalité, par exemple, ils s'en battent un peu les couilles du mariage gay à proprement parler. Ce qui les inquiète, c'est le sort des enfants. Et comme l'adoption de l'un dans la loi entrainera l'arrivée de l'autre, ils s'opposent au mariage gay. Ce qu'ils défendent, c'est plus une conception du monde et de la civilisation, qui est relativement logique et compréhensible (sans forcément qu'on soit d'accord) par le plus grand nombre. C'est pour ça que je ne pense pas qu'il y ait malhonnêteté. Mais si tu veux t'étendre un peu plus sur ton avis là dessus, ça m'intéresserait, sérieusement.

&gt;aucune étude scientifique ne va en leur faveur

Là, ils vont pouvoir te montrer de façon très convaincante que les études ""pro"" ne sont pas crédibles ou scientifiques non plus. (C'était du moins le cas il y a environ cinq ans). 

Non, sérieusement, j'ai fréquenté des milieux catho-coincés, plus ou moins croyants, et plus ou moins radicalisés politiquement. Ce que j'ai observé, c'est que l'engagement politique est réellement séparé de la foi. Ceux qui étaient les plus facho montraient plus ostensiblement des signes religieux, mais étonnamment, cela était bien plus vrai quand des non cathos étaient présents. Et quand on les voyait dans un milieu catho, honnêtement, tu te demandais si ils croyaient, et en quoi. Malheureusement, ce sont ceux là qui vont se faire entendre, le plus souvent. Ce qui m'énerve un peu dans ce genre de débats, c'est qu'on va tout de suite classifier ceux qui s'engagent politiquement à droite comme des cathos acharnés, (sachant qu'en plus on accentue très souvent le côté extrémiste autant au niveau religieux que politique) alors que si, oui, l'un et l'autre peuvent souvent être présent côte à côte chez des individus et un milieu social donné ils découlent pas, à mon avis, l'un de l'autre. Dans les faits, on observe souvent l'un avec l'autre, mais je ne crois pas que le lien soit nécessaire, au contraire. Au final, ça m'énerve un peu que dès que l'on parle de cathos, on pense à des extrémistes de droite. Je crois que c'est une notion à peu près aussi difficile à piger que l'argument de l’Église qui différencie l'acte de la personne, le péché du pécheur (ouais ça fait vraiment bizarre de le dire comme ça, mais les actes homosexuels sont encore considérés comme des péchés^1 par l’Église Catholique), et l'orientation sexuelle de l'humain.

Je m'éloigne encore un peu plus du sujet initial, mais c'est précisément un truc qui chiffonne ""le camp de droite"". On observe souvent que les personnes homosexuelles se définissent principalement par leur orientation sexuelle. Quand on y réfléchi trois secondes, c'est quand même assez étonnant et dérangeant. Je généralise peut-être beaucoup, mais je l'ai quand même un peu observé personnellement. Je conçois toutefois que cela puisse être du à une minorité vocale.

main je vote à droite si le bon sens et la capacité à faire des calculs élémentaires sur des données vérifiées revient dans leur camp.

Je suis marié à une Japonaise, j'ai donc le droit légal et moral de choisir si je monte une entreprise en France ou au Japon. Je paierai des impôts là où j'habiterai, je cotiserai pour ma retraire en France dans les deux cas. Tel que c'est parti, je vais aller au Japon, à cause d'un impôt dont on ne parle pas, d'un i
mpôt implicite, qui change radicalement la façon d'entreprendre en France : si je monte une boite, j'ai besoin de payer un comptable pour arriver à payer mes impôts, même si je suis seul dans ma boite. Avant d'embaucher quelqu'un, il me faudra un comptable. 1000 ou 2000 euros par an.

Il ne s'agit pas que d'argent, il s'agit de controle et de confiance. Je préférerais payer plus à un taux fixe que d'avoir à chercher la bonne niche et le bon formulaire qui corresponde à ma situation, sachant que souvent il y a plusieurs choix légalement possibles, et qu'il est à peu près impossible de savoir quelle
s sont les conséquences de tel ou tel choix sans être expert-comptable. Si je peux prévoir combien d'impot je vais payer en 2014, je peux avoir une stratégie. À la limite, ok, mettez moi des taux différents en fonction du nombre d'employés ou de niveau de revenus ou profits.
 
Le truc c'est que demain je peux tomber sur un client qui me dit ""On veut que tu réalises ce gros projet qui demande une équipe de 5 personnes, y compris 2 sur place, ici en Australie. Combien ça couterait ?"" Je ne demande pas que en France ça coute moins cher, je demande juste qu'il soit possible d'y répondre sans résoudre d'équations différentielles et avoir tous les paramètres en tête en même temps (hint : avec de l'entrainement, sept variable c'est le max. Je suis pas spécialement entrainé alors cinq variables c'est mon maximum)

Résultat, l'année prochaine je serai surement au Japon, à payer surement plus d'impôts, mais créer une activité est simple et je paierai un flatrate, le mécanisme de TVA est plus simple. Je sais combien ça me coutera de bosser avec Akimasa ou avec Florent (qui lui va se démerder avec ses propres impôts).

Et je réserve pour un autre rant les horreurs que j'ai découvert quand je me suis posé des questions sur ce qu'est une entreprise multi-nationale et si une PME peut l'être (ben oui, quand on veut bosser avec des Américains, des Japonais, des Australiens et de Français, ce qui est naturel sur internet, on découvre que le onde légal a vraiment du mal à suivre)

The problem with these types of actions, or even things such as posters downvoting people into oblivion, is that it enforces only certain views to be acceptable.  I've had this happen to me many times despite coherently stating why I disagreed with the general consencious.   

When someones views are down voted to the point where they are hidden or deleted, it assumes that such views shouldn't be held nor discussed, and those who try to debate them are ""children"" or ""troll-bait.""  Although this is a problem that at it's core lies with the syntax of reddit as a whole, it's rather anti-intellectual in itself and inevitably leads to a cult like environment where only certain views can be held.

In the end, any suppression of freedom of speech, as long as that speech has actual content, likely leads to more suppression of speech.  I believe we should make /r/europe a place where people can post their legitimate opinions without being fucked over by a hivemind.

&gt; So, assuming that it is indeed the case that, because of outdated perceptions, qualified women are kept out of the top positions, can you think of an alternative to the quota solution that might solve the problem?

you are asking how we could actually solve the cases where it's not legitimate cultural preference, but simple prejudice against women that is blocking their access to top positions, correct?

If so, the answer I am most tempted by -- but that only applies for a limited set of cases -- is to just let them sink by themselves. *They will*, slowly, but surely. For every company that, due to weinerfest biasing, chooses to hire a less skilled candidate just because he is a man, in the detriment of a better prepared woman candidate, there are several companies ran by clever people who will snatch the better candidate.

I am not entirely satisfied with this approach though, as the expected outcome won't apply to fields like mine, that are so overly male-dominated that the few women who do work in the field moving away from companies that treat them badly will not make much of a difference. This will have the added disadvantage of discouraging young women to choose that field to specialize in, if the practice is widespread enough.

Unfortunately, especially where the HR drones have a significant word to say in hiring, it's very hard to impose a solution that cannot be eschewed through clever corporate bullshit. If candidates can be readily rejected because a 45-minute interview deems him or her ""not assertive enough"" or ""not the kind of teamplayer we need in our company"", you can immediately run and hide behind them while barring women just because they are women. The quota has the advantage that it cannot be eschewed with this kind of meaningless crap, but I think its advantage is outweighted by the fact that it has the side effect of introducing a loophole that forces potentially incompetent people into positions they do not deserve only because they are of a certain sex -- which is exactly the opposite effect of what is intended to do (i.e. push competent people into the positions they deserve, regardless of sex).

I can't say I have any simple solution. One option I sometimes think about is to encourage -- and offer incentives for -- outreach activities and special internships for young women. Internships, even when they are paid, have the advantage that they don't hurt anyone in the long term, require relatively little funding, and are otherwise great to get your feet wet. The trick seems to be in finding solutions that do not force people into undeserved positions based only on gender, *while* not allowing employers to get access to cheap funding by hiring barely-qualified women and giving them unfulfilling, futureless tasks. In other words, encourage them to create the conditions required to bring women in their field and encourage them to try their luck, but ensure that neither the employees (by forcing people they don't want for legitimate reasons), nor the candidates (by having employers hire them just because there are incentives for hiring them), are exploitable. It's tricky, but with a little effort and some patience, I think it can be done.",0,1351059978,null,0,false,0,c6qxx8m,t3_11xupq,t1_c6qxx8m,t1_c6qklya,null,1430225278,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Barcelona and Sevilla are two other must-see destinations.

There is no shortage of museums in Madrid, so take full advantage of those!  Many of them are even free to students or at certain hours, so check beforehand.

The nightlife is also pretty renowned, so grab a few good friends and go to a discoteca.  Even if that's not ordinarily your thing, it's worth trying once just to say you've done it.

Be sure to get un abono mensual (monthly ticket) for the metro/bus (good for both).  It's the cheapest way to move around the city.  Cabs are much more affordable than in the States, but they're still not cheap.

Ultimately, conservatism simply means the **embracing uncertainty**  i.e. that you cannot make rules (like human rights) that will make a state work like a perfect machine, but you must accept the uncertainty of human debate, judgement, which also means accepting that sometimes that judgement will be wrong.

INGREDIENTS:

* 1 kg / 2 lb 3 oz ripe red tomatoes

* 200 g / 7 oz white bread (better if it's hard, a day old or two)

* 1 garlic clove (for some, half is enough)

* salt

PREPARATION

1. Clean the tomatoes. Cut them in quarters and crush them into a liquid paste with a blender. Put this paste through a colender to eliminate the skin and the seeds.

2. Cut the bread in small pieces and mix with the tomato paste. Let it rest for 10 minutes.

3. Peel the garlic clover. Remove the centre of the garlic so it isn't as hard on the stomach. Add it to the mix.

4. Add the extra virgin olive oil and a pinch or two of salt. Blend the mix together until you obtain a smooth puree. Check for salt and rectify if needed.

5. Stick in the fridge for a couple hours or more. You absolutely have to have it well cold.

Also the Professor of statistics Walter Krämer said it's the ""unstatistic of the month"". Even when including the spending power, you only need an income of 110€ in romania not to count as endangered by poverty but 2833€ in Luxemburg.

First of all, there are three critereas from the EU for beeing affected by poverty:

1. Your income is less than 60% than the average, that would be below 952€ for a single person.

2. Material deprivation, that means at least 4 out of 9 following things are missing: paying for rent, heating, unexpected expenses, one appropriate meal every two times, 1 week of holydays outside of your flat/house, car, washing machine, color-tv, phone

3. Labour participation: Below 2,4 months for a single without kids, below 9,6 months for a family with 2 kids and only one income

If one of these three critereas is met, you are in the statistic as endangered by poverty. Now why that statistic is skewed:

I) 8,5% of people in germany meet critera one (less than 952€ as single) but say about their life, it limits their way of life. This is because these people live in areas where living is cheap also. Income is low there, but it's also cheap to live.

II) Labour participation: 2,3% of people in germany work less than 2 months a year but earn more than 60% of the average income. These may be people with assets like houses etc. These people may be very rich, but according to the EU, they are poor because the don't work.

If you calculate this now, there are only 9,1% who are endangered of poverty. This is less than the half of the value the EU calculated.

&gt;*you are asking how we could actually solve the cases where it's not legitimate cultural preference, but simple prejudice against women that is blocking their access to top positions, correct?*

Correct, though, I'm not quite sure what you mean by '*legitimate cultural preference*'. 

&gt;*For every company that, due to weinerfest biasing, chooses to hire a less skilled candidate just because he is a man, in the detriment of a better prepared woman candidate, there are several companies ran by clever people who will snatch the better candidate.*

That '*weinerfest biasing*' reference sounds kind of gay. Is that a thing?  Otherwise the argument does make sense.

&gt;*One option I sometimes think about is to encourage -- and offer incentives for -- outreach activities and special internships for young women.*

That may indeed attract more women in a field, like engineering, where women are under-represented. Of course, in principle, this solution is vulnerable to the same objection as quotas (""She got the internship for being a woman!""). But it does minimise the possibility of unqualified personnel getting through, since an intern's performance can be evaluated before hiring. It's quite a good solution for certain fields, if, once hired, the original ""*glass ceiling*"" problem does  not prevent qualified women from reaching the sought-after top positions.

&gt;*In other words, encourage them [employers] to create the conditions required to bring women in their field and encourage them to try their luck, but ensure that neither the employees (by forcing people they don't want for legitimate reasons), nor the candidates (by having employers hire them just because there are incentives for hiring them), are exploitable. It's tricky, but with a little effort and some patience, I think it can be done.*

My impression is that the problem is more complicated. 

Where, in my opinion, we often fail is in the refusal to recognise that biases can, in a very general sense, be ""*objective*"". They can be somewhat accurate. Biases can, in other words, be legitimate generalisations. But this is considered taboo. Few people permit themselves to recognise that this may be the case. That is why I was earlier curious as to your use of  '*legitimate cultural preference*'. 

Now, though I disagree with the theoretical aspect of forbidding the recognition of a truth, I nonetheless **do** agree with our society's purely practical disregard of some aspects it. Our society's (unspoken) working theory is that even if there existed some '*natural*' (not due to culture) gender differences (in ability or character) that may affect job performance, it would still be better to ignore them.

To give you an analogy. Even though it is objectively true, accurate and a legitimate generalisation to say that men are generally taller than women, some women are actually taller than most men. But the thing about ""tallness"", is that you can immediately see it. Imagine if tallness were a hidden ability of your mind like the ability for ""*mathematical abstraction*"". One would, because of laziness, be tempted to ignore women candidates. A superior woman candidate (to all available men candidates) would thus be dismissed out of hand. This would also create a hellish culture for capable women.

Let us imagine, to use an other analogy, that 65% of men happen to be ""*capable*"" (so to speak)  car-drivers compared to only 45% of women. If I run a taxi company, for example, it still does not make sense to differentiate between men and women when hiring. And this even if, from my experience, ""men are better driver than women"". Why? Because I end up with fewer choices but mostly because it's unfair to those women who are indeed excellent drivers, especially if some are better than most (or conceivably all) men.

To conclude, even if many of us feel that some obvious truths are being idiotically hidden by the ""politically correct"" crowd, their efforts are actually not as idiotic as all that. What the ""quota"" people are trying to address is that we are seldom aware of our own biases. And when we are aware of them, we always consider them to be have some legitimate basis. This might even, as a general rule, be sometimes correct. But the influence of biases (which mostly occurs subconsciously) leads, besides being unjust, to making the wrong decisions. 

The question before us was and is how to combat this phenomenon in order to create an equitable and a better (in terms of abilities) work environment.

As far as I can tell, the only rational and just solution is still to establish axiocratic (""meritocratic"") policies through the use of some type of objective criteria.
