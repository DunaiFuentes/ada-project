I think your list is pretty much accurate, although I'm not really sure about comparing Vancouver to Paris. I would compare Vancouver to a lot of more similar places like San Francisco or Portland, but not Paris.

Also, I have to say I was surprised that you didn't mention Paris's breathtaking architecture, the cobblestone streets (Bastille) that ooze with history. 

Vancouver has awesome beaches (unlike Paris) and just a completely different, laid-back feel to it. 
Paris (from what I could see intra-muros), on the other hand, has a more interesting cultural life and Parisians seem to care about etiquette and style (I sure did when I was there, hehe!). 
So to me, they are two totally different cities.

Personally, I prefer Paris, because I miss its culture, and I miss the art of ""refaire le monde autour d'un verre"" that's so very parisien. In Vancouver, the conversations are more down to earth and usually (not to generalize) about very pragmatic topics like car and property prices, what's up on tv and bashing Stephen Harper.

Also, I've never felt any racism in Vancouver (it's Canada after all :)) but that may be because people really don't seem to mix here. The groups of people you'll see hangin' out here are usually very ethnically heterogeneous, which is not at all the case in France, where there is more of a ""melting-pot/assimilation"" attitude with immigrants than the famous Canadian ""mosaic"".",0,1345437311,null,0,1345437640,0,c5vt5xf,t3_x7zz3,t1_c5vt5xf,t3_x7zz3,null,1429684766,1,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,1

Hamburg is a really good idea. Many people think it's the most beautiful city in Germany and although this is not my opinion I can see why.
Things to do in Hamburg would include:

Do some sight seeing, everything around the ""Binnenalster"" is beautiful. From there you are basically at the Rathhaus (city hall) which is most certainly one of the most beautiful ones in Germany.
You should also take a look at Hamburg harbor. Mainly Speicherstadt is worth taking a look at.

A cheap way to do a ""boat tour"" on the Elbe and through the harbor would  be to take one of the ""public transport ferries) You can pretty much do a round trip for 2.70€ (I think) compared to 16-20€ for a tourist attraction. You don't get all the talking bout you can take in all the beautiful views :-)

if you want to see the Hamburg night life the thing to do would be to go to ""Sternschanze"". There are a lot of bars and especially in the Summer it's beautiful since many people sit outside and enjoy life.

A little bit more extravagant but definitely worth seeing is the ""Reeperbahn"" which is basically a long street with sex shops, night clubs and brothels. But I think it's worth taking a look at, won't see anything quite like this in all of Germany.

One last thing. If you are there on a saturday morning make sure to see the Fischmarkt which is only opened between 5am and 9.30am . It's just one of the most grotesque things I've ever seen. On the one hand you got your typical market with lots of fish and vegetables that are sold and on the other hand you got a whole hall with Rock concerts, people drinking beer etc. Really funny and worth checking out.

true,int_0x80,FRNK,Franconia,"January through March is the *worst* time to travel in Europe.  You'll get all of the terrible weather without even the slightly nice parts about being able to see the Christmas-related celebrations that are everywhere (or the New Years celebrations).  If you can delay your trip to be from April-June or so, you'll have a much better time.  If you can't, though, keep in mind that you'll have to pack for different climates: cold and snowy in the northern countries, cold and rainy across the central countries, and mild (or occasionally even slightly warm) in the southern ones.  Plan on travel delays in Germany, as the weather in those months causes problems with both airplanes and trains.  If you're in England and it snows, don't even think about trying to take a train anywhere.  British Rail is allergic to snow.

As to where to start - the logical thing to do would be to find a reasonably priced flight to Heathrow or Schiphol and work your way east from London or Amsterdam respectively.  You could also fly into CDG, but it's a very horrible airport.  If you fly into Frankfurt, you'll probably want to immediately take a train or connecting flight elsewhere - Frankfurt is not a very interesting city, although I guess you could spend a day or two there.

I suggest that you plan to spend no *fewer* than 5 days in any of the large cities.  You'll see a lot more, and it gives you more flexibility to go on day trips to surrounding areas.  Also when you're planning your trip, remember that traveling from one country to the next can take up an entire day.

Don't spend all of your time in the large cities - for a truly ""European Experience"" you need to get out and visit other places.  For example:

* Instead of spending a week in London, spend 5 days in London (one of which should be exclusively devoted to the British Museum) and 5 days in Cardiff or something.
* Instead of a week in Amsterdam, spend a few days there and go on some day trips to places like Utrecht or Leiden
* Instead of a week in Berlin, spend four or five days in Hamburg, four or five in Berlin, and then a day or two in Leipzig on your way south to Bavaria, the beautiful, friendly part of Germany.

Also, don't forget the eastern edges of the EU.  Krakow is worth a short visit, and Prague and Budapest are both worth spending several days to explore.  Slovakia is beautiful and much cheaper than neighboring Austria, so you should go through Bratislava on your way to Vienna, or vice-versa.  Lithuania and Latvia as well, but you should check if you need a Russian transit visa if you're taking a train from Poland and it goes through Kaliningrad Oblast.

Anyway, a random collection of things:

* The Alps are full of small, beautiful villages.  One of my favorites is [Mittenwald](http://www.brodyaga.com/pages/viewlarge.php?id=7493&amp;cty=Mittenwald&amp;place=Germany,%2520Bayern) in the Bavarian Pre-Alps.  If you aren't a skier, you probably won't want to spend more than a night there, but it's still nice.

* Lisbon will probably have warmest temperatures of any major city during the time you are in Europe.  It's a nice place to spend a few days. Likewise, you can also find jeans-and-tshirt weather in parts of Spain.
* Côte d'Azur might be slightly warm (like, 20C in Nice or something) but it's very expensive.  Monaco is a laugh if you're in the area, though.
* I don't know what Rome is like in January, but I'd bet it's more enjoyable weather than in mid-summer, the only times I've ever visited, when it's an oven.  Same for Florence.
* Belgium is very boring, although not as boring as Lichtenstein.  But you should still spend a few days in Brussels.  I'd skip Antwerp, though, unless you're going to Brussels by train from Amsterdam and need to buy beer along the way.
* I've never understood the appeal of London.  The museums are fantastic, but places like Manchester and Brighton are less stressful.  Tougher to get to, though, since British rail is horrible.
* Zurich feels very sterile to me for some reason, Geneva is pretty, and the towns around Lake Constance (particularly Lindau) have a unique charm to them.
* If you're in Vilnius and want to get out of the city, go to [Trakai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trakai).
* In the Czech Republic, places like [Harrachov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrachov) are fun in the winter, if you like the outdoors.

Eating for free : next to the Gare de l'Est every evening there is a food distribution for people in need, apart from that no freebies that I know of.

Tips and tricks: little Brand supermarkets like G20 or Franprix will have discount prices on fresh products ending 1 or 2 days laters.

Catacombs is a win, there are some guided visits (Denfert station) or if not afraid of small dark places you could try one of the irregular entrances and visit on your own : flashlight, warm clothing some water and possibly some way to find your way back as they are truly immense and can be populated by some ""interesting"" individuals.

In the evening and at night, the banks of the Seine around Notre Dame are a very lively area with people playing music and drinking and generally having a happy time.

Wifi : MCdonalds, a lot of cafés and a few of the major stations also provide wireless.

If that's the case  the same applies to racists too.

Let me rephrase that for you:

&gt; All cultures are evolving. If an influx of racists means that Sweden will change to accommodate then, then what's wrong with that? You can't hold onto your cultural norms if a majority of people who are legally residents of and/or voting citizens of your country want them to not exist. If Swedish youth started rallying through the streets and legally provided enough mass support for their ideas to get them turned into law, what could you do about it? The same laws apply to citizens of your country be they racists or not. Racists have rights just like you do, whether they love the way Swedish culture is now or want it changed.

I'm just arguing against the notion that the only definition of ""race"" is the contemporary, predominantly American usage that divides people into groups like ""Caucasian"" or ""Asian"" or ""Hispanic"".

Historically, ""race"" has been defined in many ways - phenotype, ethnicity, religion, nationality or geographical origin, etc. And in Europe, specifically, the term racism is still very much used to describe discrimination based on ethnicity.

Of course, from a biological point of view, none of these definitions make a lot of sense. For example, there's probably more biological variation within the groups defined as ""Caucasian"" and ""Hispanic"" than there are biological differences between those two groups.

true,ninjacows,AUST,'Straya,"i love that in these arguments there are almost always two different types of people - those that have witnessed first hand the immigration problems in europe and are now scared to let their girlfriends walk down the street alone at night due to the sexist and oppressive culture that is being forced upon the countries being immigrated to, and then those who haven't had to deal with this first hand on a day to day basis and who are blindly calling out anyone who sees issues with current cultural integration throughout europe a racist

edit: there are a lot of in-betweens here but this is the general argument i see online in relation to the spread of islam into western culture. i also have nothing against islam, or any religion for that matter, but by bringing their cultural ideologies about women and how to treat others into western countries a lot of immigrants earn an incredibly bad name for their entire culture. if you come to another country it should go without saying that you respect the way of life and the social standards. just because a woman chose to wear a summer dress on a hot day does not mean that she is a ""whore"" that can be groped and spat on when she refuses your incredibly blunt advances.
this obviously occurs in western culture as well, but far less often as we aren't raised with the idea that women are inferior objects. if you travel to an islamic country with say, your girlfriend, and she asks a man a question, quite often he will hear it and respond to you without even looking at the woman. 

so really a lot of this all boils down to education and upbringing. they are educated to believe in certain values.
as a culture, then, is it our duty to undo this education? 
they live in tight knit communities that don't tend to interact with outsiders. they educate themselves through family and friends, and this attitude perpetuates itself as a result. so how can the government break through this barrier and get to the youth without being accused of ""brainwashing"" them?

in flemmish belgium, they released a video that all immigrants have to watch that basically explains the differences between say, an islamic culture, and the western culture in their new country. it was basic information, like ""women are equals. following them on the street and sexually accosting them because of the way they dress is not acceptable"", ""the general population here sleeps before 10 PM and it is considered rude to make much noise beyond this time at night because it might keep your neighbors up""

it was met with a LOT of critiscism from the islamic population due to percieved racism. you can't even address the cultural gap in a critical manner without being accused of being a narrow minded bigot. 

the fact is, it is an incredibly complex and sensitive issue. it is not black and white racism vs wanting a progressive, more positive future. there are so many things that need to be considered, and it is ignorant to take either stance to any blind extreme without examining all of the facts with a clear head.

**Economic Differences**

What remained of the economy in the GDR was not pretty and could not compete with West Germany's modern factories etc. This draws through until today. THe unemployment rate in East Germany is higher than in the west and the average wage is also below west average.
So yeah up until today most big companies tend to have a lot of sites in west Germany but (with the exception of Berlin) not in the East.

**Religious Differences**

Well, hard to answer - all I can say is that church is in my perception more dominant in the west, probably due to the fact, that religion was not as prominent during the GDR. Some families in East Germany up to this day celebrate the ""Jugendweihe"" as a ""anarchist"" way of the protestant confirmation. Long story short - east probably not as religiously involved as west.

**Political Differences**

Probably pretty obvious. East Germany will vote more on the left side of the spectrum (so SPD or Linke in parties). But they're equally democratic as the west. System is the same ;-) Just another personal thing i tend to here from no and then is that in the east there are more Nazi formations than in the west. I can't prove that with facts or anything it's just a perception of news i have.

On the general subject she discussed about: It's a very controversial subject which seems to be very popular yet not really discussed at any serious level. There are various 'sources' that list 'facts' from one side and 'facts' from the other side and both sides have no true credibility. The thing that interests me is that you can talk to people from many different countries and get similar sort of answers regarding certain groups of people. I would normally brand most of these people as racists/far-right, but the thing that just doesn't add up is that a lot of these people talk in english, discuss these things with people from other countries and generally don't seem to mind that (which I guess would go against the concept of 'racism' in general).

Are certain groups of people known to do specific things that are unpopular more than the average? Is there real statistic proof of such a thing? Why does it happen? What can be done to correct this? We aren't gonna get anywhere by ignoring the subject if it is indeed true. We've already witnessed voters in several countries starting to vote more far-right (Le Penn, True Finns, UKIP, Golden Dawn etc) and I believe the platform which attracts these voters is the whole anti-immigrant thing.

The thing that blows my mind is that you have people from many different countries complaining about a specific group of immigrants with a very consistent message.. but yet I cannot really call a lot of these people racists as they do not actually have a problem with any other form of immigrant or foreigner.

In 2009, the Solidaritätszuschlag netted the federal government just under twelve billion euros, and the payments from the Solidarpakt amounted to around 9.5 billion euros. However, the Solidarpakt money decreases from year to year, so in 2012 only 7.3 billion will be paid out and it will stop completely after 2019. On the other hand, there are a lot of direct and indirect helps to the East that are being paid, so the tl;dr would be: not all of the money from the Solidaritätszuschlag goes to the East, and not all the money going to the East comes from the Solidaritätszuschlag.",0,1345466779,null,0,false,0,c5vx7er,t3_yinec,t1_c5vx7er,t1_c5vx0b6,null,1429686713,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

true,StoneCall,SACH,Leipzig,"Let me add to your (very good) post from the Eastern perspective:

&gt; What remained of the economy in the GDR was not pretty and could not compete with West Germany's modern factories etc.

This is mostly true, with the exception of a few companies which were on world market level in the GDR and survived the Wende (the prime example is Carl Zeiss Jena, which continues as Carl Zeiss AG and Jenoptik).

&gt; So yeah up until today most big companies tend to have a lot of sites in west Germany but (with the exception of Berlin) not in the East.

Actually, when it comes to industrial output, the East has almost reached Western level by now (80-90 percent of Western output, I don't remember the exact numbers). The problem is that the East is often the ""long work bench"" of the West: the factories are in the East, but the headquarters are in the West, so the highly qualified jobs and the tax revenue mostly stay in the West.

&gt; Well, hard to answer - all I can say is that church is in my perception more dominant in the west, probably due to the fact, that religion was not as prominent during the GDR.

[This is true.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Religion_map_germany_2008.png) You can see most of the Western states have more than 50% of people belonging to the two main religions, while most Eastern states have less than 25%. Being religious and active in the church could get you disadvantaged in the GDR. 

&gt; Some families in East Germany up to this day celebrate the ""Jugendweihe"" as a ""anarchist"" way of the protestant confirmation.

The Jugendweihe is not ""anarchist"" in any way. It was invented in the 19th century by freethinkers as an alternative to the confirmation.

In GDR times, they were voluntary on paper, but getting a confirmation instead could get you disadvantaged, see above. The ceremony consisted of a speech given by some guy from the SED (I think you can imagine what the speech was about) and a pledge (to socialism and to the GDR), and then everybody got a book, with a lot of music in-between.

Nowadays, the speech is not about socialism, generally given by some kind of local celebrity or politician, and presents are given to the youths privately by family.

There was also an attempt to replace baptism by the ""Namensweihe"".

&gt; Probably pretty obvious. East Germany will vote more on the left side of the spectrum (so SPD or Linke in parties). But they're equally democratic as the west. System is the same ;-)

That's not quite the case. The only thing that's consistent is that FDP and Greens are much less relevant in the Eastern states, and Die Linke is much more relevant.

Saxony and Thuringia are conservative; the CDU even had the absolute majority between 1990 and 2004 in Saxony and between 1999 and 2004 in Thuringia. Die Linke has overtaken SPD somewhere around the turn of the century.

In Saxony-Anhalt, the CDU is weaker but still wins elections. SPD and Die Linke are on equal footing.

In Brandenburg, the SPD is the strongest party. They were originally followed by the CDU and then Die Linke, but now Die Linke has overtaken the CDU.

In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD is generally the strongest party, followed by the CDU and the Linke.

Also, the right-wing extremist parties (NPD and formerly DVU) have only won seats in the East: The NPD holds seats in Saxony and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and the DVU held seats in Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt.

&gt; Just another personal thing i tend to here from no and then is that in the east there are more Nazi formations than in the west. I can't prove that with facts or anything it's just a perception of news i have.

Americans move more often and farther away, they are more prone to move for a job, they solve their conflicts by litigation (confrontation) rather than compromise, the neighbourhoods are less mixed (in terms of class as well as ethnicity/race), etc.

&gt;Really? Then why do Germans freak out when anyone mentions teaching Turkish in the schools. It's a language like any other and could help them both in their daily lives and in preparation for the future.

It's their own language, and they take offense at people not being able to communicate in the language of the community, because that makes integration effectively impossible; in particular because integration has proven not to be a given.

&gt;First, there are stupid people in Europe. It doesn't define the country. 

The general education levels do, though.

&gt;I heard it spoken about very little in the US because we know it's inevitable.

In the culturally dominant US, it's indeed inevitable. It's much less a given in smaller countries, who feel the cultural pressures of other, bigger countries already. In addition, second generation migrants often are *less* integrated than their parents, so people have no reason to think time will solve everything.

&gt;Second, I've been on welfare in Germany and it's not easy. It's almost impossible without kids and if you do manage, it's not that much money. Most foreigners don't come here to take advantage of anyone, they just want to work and feed their families.

true,Spelter,THUE,Thüringen,"By far the most balanced and truthful answer in this thread. Being born in the GDR myself, I have to agree with pretty much all observations here.  
Economy is still not at the same level as it is in the western states but it's slowly and steadily improving. The eastern state of Saxony for example has seen quite a boost and the area around Dresden has a very high living standard. Going from ""no economy"" to ""full on export oriented social market economy"" is simply not done over night. Or even in 10 years. However the biggest improvements are made in urban areas and for every success story there is a poor, neglected and run down farming village in the Brandenburg hinterlands where the only glimpse of hope is a cheap beer at the bus stop with your unemployed buddies and the promises made by a local neo-nazi politician. 
 
The east is indeed very inclined to the political left, for various reasons. There was a thread about that on here about 1 or 2 weeks ago. The poor, less educated and unemployed however seek refuge in extremist parties, especially the far right. This not only makes the east leading in left party supporters but also in right-wing activists. However the left far outweighs the right. When 600 Neo Nazis plan to march in Dresden, 25000 counter-protesters regularly lock down the city by blocking all routes. 

And yes, the east is largely atheist. I myself know of no person in my family and circle of friends who had a religious communion or confirmation except for my dad, whose mother grew up in Czechoslovakia (Sudetendeutsche) and thus was catholic. Other than that socialism and religion didn't really see eye to eye. I was quite surprised actually at how deeply rooted the church still is in the western states when I moved there and found a girlfriend in Cologne. Everyone had confirmation or communion, was member of a church, paid the church tax and married in a church. However few actually seemed to believe and in fact might actually identify themselves as atheist. It's simply the way how it's done. When you're 14 you dress up in your finest clothes, have your confirmation with all your friends from school, you learn the words and stories, lie to the priest about your devotion to god, then you get a party and loads of presents. That's not how religion should work in my opinion but that's how it is for many, it seems. So while in statistics the east will always show up as largely atheist and the western states as more religious I actually believe that religion is not really that important in the west either. It's just tradition and rituals for the most part.  

And rivalries...well. It's true that as an eastern German I'm quite used to hearing jokes about the GDR, the east in general or us weird ""Ossis"" but I have actually never discovered the expressed attitudes in real life. For the most part it seems to be just that: jokes and local rivalries which are common pretty much everywhere in Germany. People from Cologne will always make fun of Düsseldorfers, Bavarians and the rest of Germany, which they perceive as ""Preißn"" (bloody Prussians), will always bicker a bit, Franks will forever refuse being called Bavarians, no one will ever admit to liking the beer from the neighboring town above the hometowns brew and Ossis and Wessis will continue to make jokes about each other for quite a while. There are of course people who actually mean it on both sides and they will often be very vocal about it but I personally have not once been victim to discrimination or discriminated against someone because of which side of the former border they were born on. The ""Ossi"" and ""Wessi"" terms are passed down to younger generations but the difference between kids from today's east and west is pretty much non-existent. While my parents might be able to tell a ""Wessi"" of their generation from an ""Ossi"" based on subtle hints, I (born in 1986) already can't tell where someone is from in normal day-to-day life if they don't happen to speak a dialect.  
So while there are noticeable regional differences, like everywhere else in Germany, I'm under the impression that Germans are a pretty united people and in fact never stopped being one. Everyone was excited when the wall came down, east and west alike. Only when the reality of how hard the reunification would be for everyone involved sank in did resentment rear it's head. But it's fading and little more remains than local rivalries and a bit of more or less tongue-in-cheek teasing. At least that's my subjective experience with those damn arrogant Wessis.

true,dreamer_,EURO,European Union,"&gt; This makes me wonder why Poland is so avidly catholic?

Few fun facts:

 * Until last year, all polls about religious affiliation were performed by asking... religious institutions. Catholic church in Poland states, that if you were baptised, then you are Catholic. Hence &gt;90% Catholics in Poland.
 * Baptisms are going down year after year, lately they fell down below 90% for the first time
 * Every once a year, Statistics Institute of Cathlic Church makes head count in churches and generates stats about actual mass attendance. Results: since 80s there is steady, slight downward trend. Now it stands at 40%.
 * When polls are asking people about their attendance (instead of doing head count), it mysteriously rises to ~60%
 * According to abovementioned polls there are more Catholics in Poland, then people who believe in God.

On the other hand:

 * Lots and lots of new churches are being built every year, despite that Church says, that it doesn't have money for existing ones.
 * Poland is leading Europe in number of young priests AFAIK
 * When certain religious organization (Radio Maryja) starts a protest, literally tens of thousands of people go out to the streets. But since most of them are old(er) and they don't constitute majority, that would guarantee succes in next election (and their claims are ridiculous), they are mostly dismissed by leading political party.",0,1345470960,null,0,false,0,c5vxvlh,t3_yijjo,t1_c5vxvlh,t1_c5vw24b,null,1429687024,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

- It's the international language of pilots and airways.  If you're a pilot, you speak English in the air.

- It's become the international language of science.  Attend an international conference/delegation and the talks will be in English.

When all the big blockbusters and hugely successful bands are speaking English you either get cheap dubbing or covers, or you get subtitles and learn the lingo.

- It is easily the most descriptive language with the largest vocabulary.

- European universities even now cover entire courses only in English.  It's long been the case in parts of sub-continental Asia.

- Because of the Empire, the Commonwealth, the influence of America and the Cold War the exposure to English is ubiquitous, which can't be said for other large based languages such as Mandarin and its regional dialects, or even Spanish.

You can only make yourself so non-competitive before you fail to be able to afford the services and safety nets your population desires and requires. France (while stable now) is in danger of passing that point in the near future.

Mr. Hollande has overstepped. He can barely afford the ""not enough"" gestures he's been able to implement. He will soon be cornered by markets that see France as a dangerous and unfriendly place, and a population pushing him to give them all of the things he promised, but cannot do.

His ""token"" gesture increasing the taxation on income above 1 million to 75% will gain him little money, but will do much to ensure foreign investors steer clear of France. Their banks are overcommitted to the PIGS countries, and will not want to risk capital internally. With those 2 things in mind, the chances of enough growth to sustain Mr. Hollande's changes are low.

This is similarly untrue. Any extradition from Sweden to the United States would actually be more difficult. This is because it would require the consent of both Sweden and the United Kingdom.

One can add that there is no evidence whatsoever that the United Kingdom would not swiftly comply with any extradition request from the United States; quite the reverse.  Ask Gary McKinnon, or Richard O'Dwyer, or the NatWest Three.

That said, every time I tried to use my German with anyone under 30, they would hear my accent, ask if I was English/American, and then start speaking English back to me. Over 30 is hit and miss, but nearly everyone in Germany speaks enough English to understand and help you out. I met maybe three people my whole time (2 months) there that couldn't understand me at all. You won't be lost. 

I'd never traveled by myself either, but you'll be introduced to people once you make it to the Uni who will help to guide you around for the first few days. You'll probably meet alot of other exchange students, so you'll be able to help each other out alot too. 

I discovered that the more I planned before I left, the less nervous I felt about everything. At the very least, figure out your route to the Uni from the airport before you leave. If you have to take a train, know the schedule before you go. You don't have to buy a ticket before you leave, as there are automated ticket machines in every station. I had to ask a stranger for help the first time, but they are pretty easy to use once you figure it out. The machines will show you available routes between cities and show you prices of different train routes. It will even print them out for you so you can take a minute to decide. This was especially helpful when I was standing there scratching my head while people waited in line behind me.

If you plan on traveling between cities/countries, it's always a good idea to visit one of the Reisebureau offices that are in the stations. It's free and they can help you plan the trip. 

If you think that you are going to be traveling alot between countries/to states other than Baden-Württemberg, its a good idea to look into Eurail and Deutsche Bahn passes. [Heres a link to their info.](http://www.bahn.com/i/view/GBR/en/prices/index.shtml) They both offer discounted rates for people from outside Europe and for students. You can get alot of places in Europe from Germany in the course of a weekend, and if you plan to travel around, these will save you some serious money in the long run.

Research the hostels in whatever city you plan to visit next. After my courses ended, I stayed in Europe for another 6 weeks to travel aroung Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Hostels are everywhere and they are incredibly cheap if you don't mind sharing a room. You won't likely spend much time in the room other than to sleep anyway and it's a great way to meet other student/travelers. Also, many have age restrictions, so you don't have to worry about getting stuck in a room with anyone over 25 or 26 (I forget.). I used [HostelBookers.com](www.hostelbookers.com) but there are planty of other sites like that that offer directions and reviews. I'd always look up a couple places so I'd have options once I got there. No need to book in advance either really. There are fees and the two times that I got to a place that was fully booked, they were able to recommend a good spot nearby. Once it was time to leave, I'd use a computer there to see where I could stay in the next city and then move on.

Travel was the most stressful thing for me while in Europe. Trying to get to a new city and get settled every few days was rough, but once I made it, everyone was so friendly and it felt so safe that there really wasn't much to think about other than what to see/do/eat/drink next! You'll have a great time. 

Other than the liter beers and eating at the local Brauhaus, the best thing I can recommend is to stop by a Döner Kebab shop and order one ""Mit Alles"" und ""Mit Scharf (spicy sauce)."" It's like massive gyro sandwich with all kinds of toppings. It's quite literally the best drunk food ever, it's cheap, and its available everywhere at any hour. Damn I miss those.

On 13-14 August 2010, in the home of the injured

party [AA] in Stockholm, Assange, by using violence,

forced the injured party to endure his restricting her

freedom of movement. The violence consisted in a

firm hold of the injured party's arms and a forceful

spreading of her legs whilst lying on top of her and

with his body weight preventing her from moving or

shifting.



2 - Sexual molestation



On 13-14 August 2010, in the home of the injured

party [AA] in Stockholm, Assange deliberately

molested the injured party by acting in a manner

designed to violate her sexual integrity. Assange, who

was aware that it was the expressed wish of the injured

party and a prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a

condom be used, consummated unprotected sexual

intercourse with her without her knowledge.



3 - Sexual molestation



On 18 August 2010 or on any of the days before or

after that date, in the home of the injured party [AA] in

Stockholm, Assange deliberately molested the injured

party by acting in a manner designed to violate her

sexual integrity i.e. lying next to her and pressing his

naked, erect penis to her body.



4 - Rape



On 17 August 2010, in the home of the injured party

[SW] in Enkoping, Assange deliberately consummated

sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting

that she, due to sleep, was in a helpless state.



It is an aggravating circumstance that Assange, who

was aware that it was the expressed wish of the injured

party and a prerequisite of sexual intercourse that a

condom be used, still consummated unprotected sexual

intercourse with her. The sexual act was designed to

violate the injured party's sexual integrity.""

Always travel in groups. It's much cheaper. If you're travelling within the Baden-Wurttemburg, you can get a ""Landesticket"" for 28 Euro which is good for up to 5 people on RE, IRE, S-bahn and busses within the state for a whole day. So it's really nice for traveling to other cities. The same pass exists for every state, so you could travel to Munich buy purchasing one for BW and one for Bayern. 

If it's the weekend, you can get a ""Schoenes Wochenende"" ticket, which is good for RE, IRE and S-Bahn travel nationwide. It's again for 5 people for one full day. We once used it to get from Stuttgart all the way to Berlin... which is 11 hours, would not recommend.

&gt;don't you think?

What? No I don't think so. We don't spy on every sodding citizen to see if they commit a murder either. Something like that wouldn't be worth it. Doesn't make it any less necessary for murder to be illegal. Harsh example but it's one. They try to protect the animals here not fill their pockets with money from fines.

&gt;any further assimilation seems unnecessary.

As I said they can wear their head scarfs all they want. Pray whenever they want and so on. That is not the integration i'm talking about. If they integrate enough to follow our laws and don't hurt others (For which learning the language IS necessary) then k. But still you'll see many complain about em because their thought process will go like this and for the first part they are a bit correct too. the last one not really ofcourse.

immigrants that wont completely integrate -&gt; lower chance at good jobs/ subordinated neighborhoods and such -&gt; crime and poverty -&gt; immigrants = crime and poverty

Add to that the clashing norms and values on both sides that often occur for stuff like the ritual slaughter, emancipation of women and so on plus the fact that Islam is seen as a very expansionist and if misinterpreted barbarian religion here and you see why there is growing number of racists.

My former teach English had a nice story on that last example btw with one of her students telling casually that his father returned to Southern Marokko for a while to find him a wife. She was kinda baffled by the fact and i'm quite sure its illegal in Marokko too.

In the end the whole ""hippie"" let everyone do what they want and be who they wanna be thing that you show doesn't really work out when both sides clash so hard and harm for one or both sides is inevitable without increased integration as the lack of it mainly causes the issues that make them disliked so much (increased crime, poverty, gangs)

Also consent for sex once does not grant blanket consent for sex for any period of time after. It is only consent for sex at that time.

1. You get a free ""Semesterticket"" if you register as a resident of Mannheim, otherwise buy one for 141€. If you don't have a bike it's definitely worth it. Public transport is very good and the ticket is valid for many surrounding cities such as Heidelberg.

2. The University of Mannheim takes pride in being a very internationally oriented school. That means most people will speak English fluently. Try making friends with Germans who will speak German to you, resist the temptation to hang out with English-speaking folks only.

3. If you like nature, check out the following as long as the weather keeps up (you won't want to leave the house much from november onwards): Käfertaler Wald, Reißinsel, Luisenpark, the hills behind Heidelberg, just to name a few).

4. Don't be put off by the city's exterior. Much of it was destroyed during the war. The city still has a lot to offer. The university is inside one of the biggest castles in Germany.

5. Take note of the ""Studium Generale"", an branch of the university which offers language courses, communication courses and a lot more.

Hey, that's what I call travelling!


Here are my tips, special ""weird alcools"":

In the Raval, you have the Marsella (Sant Pau, 65) where tourists go to have absinth, I recommend if you want to taste something very different.

You might also enjoy a nice Vermouth (pronounced ""vermu"") in Xampanyet (Montcada, 22) where they also cook great tapas. But that's not so relaxing.

The infamous Mariachi (codols, 14) makes its own kind of vermuth, called Mariachi as well. This can get very busy on weekends.

&gt;If you're on a budget, the cheapest tickets (for seats way up the third stand) do sell out very fast. But don't worry, seats in the third stand closer to the stadium are amply available for only ~20 Euros more. Inside tip: Seats in sections [442-444 and 426-428](http://i.imgur.com/36cCB.jpg) are very undervalued and you get a great view of the game in both halves (I bought a ticket for the Supercopa game against Madrid there for 50 Euros).

&gt;There are three ways you can buy tickets:

&gt; * Through [fcbarcelona.com](http://www.fcbarcelona.com). You can print them at home but you have to pay 2.5 Euros more.

&gt; * Through [ServiCaixa](http://www.oh-holidays.com/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/servicaixa.jpg), offered by the [La Caixa](http://noticiasbancarias.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/266_NpAdvHover.jpg) bank.

&gt; * At the stadium. I think you have to go 24 hours before the match and you might have to queue.

&gt;Getting to the stadium using public transport is easy. You can use Google Maps to check the quickest route. Don't go by car, even if you have someone to drop you off, it's madness. Motorbike is a better option; just remember where you parked, there are literally tens of thousands parked there.

&gt;If you have any questions please ask.

&gt;Have fun and don't forget to visit the rest of our beautiful city :)

Also, I checked and you're right, there hardly are any available seats next to each other. The reason is that pretty much every single seat in the Camp Nou is assigned to a season ticket holder.

No problem.

It is. But then most rape cases that don't involve violence are extremely difficult to prove. Unless there were witnesses it is often just a case of who the jury believes.

It may also be that she assumed that he was wearing a condom as she had previously requested the last time they had sex. And, as he was already having sex with her when she became conscious, she didn't have the relevant knowledge to consent.

Well, I think we agree here then.

&gt;Add to that the clashing norms and values on both sides that often occur for stuff like the ritual slaughter, emancipation of women and so on plus the fact that Islam is seen as a very expansionist and if misinterpreted barbarian religion here and you see why there is growing number of racists.

Right, but tolerance is all about accepting things you don't like or agree on, so long as they aren't illegal.

&gt;My former teach English had a nice story on that last example btw with one of her students telling casually that his father returned to Southern Marokko for a while to find him a wife. She was kinda baffled by the fact and i'm quite sure its illegal in Marokko too.

But there's nothing wrong (in a legal sense) with that. I'm an Arab, and I know what this means. This is a terrible reason to integrate immigrants for reasons other than to make them law-abiding citizens.

Because moving away essentially resets your community engagement to zero. It takes time to rebuild local social ties.

&gt;-Why does a person necessarily have to integrate if he's not breaking the law and not accepting state aid? That's really none of your business, and it's none of your business if someone decides not to learn German. 

And you ask me how I know Europe is more community-oriented? :) Arguing from a individualistic point of view what you say is sensible. However, from a communautarian POV it's not: what you do and don't do inevitably affects the community (and vice versa), so it's not really an option not to remain on speaking terms with it: you have to know what's going on (at the very least to participate in the democratic process).

&gt;There is not much choice. There is not, because we have fucked it up. Not a little but a lot. No European country has done something as boneheaded as we have. It can be explained. We have obviously lied throughout the past one and a half-two years. It was perfectly clear that what we were saying was not true. We are beyond the country's possibilities to such an extent that we could not conceive earlier that a joint government of the Hungarian Socialist Party and the liberals would ever do. And in the meantime, by the way, we did not do anything for four years. Nothing. You cannot mention any significant government measures that we can be proud of, apart from the fact that in the end we managed to get governance out of the shit. Nothing. 

(...)

&gt;Divine providence, the abundance of cash in the world economy, and hundreds of tricks, which you obviously don't need to know about, have helped us to survive this. This cannot go on

(...)

&gt; It is fantastic to run a country. Personally, I have been able to go through the past one and a half years because one thing has given me the ambition and fuelled me: to give back its faith to the left, that it can do it and it can win. That the left does not have to lower its head in this fucking country [The English word 'fucking' is not appropriate here, however the literal translation of 'kurva' cannot be put in the context. The word 'kurva' means 'whore' or 'bitch', also used as a vulgar prefix in cursing.]. That it does not have to shit its pants from Viktor Orbán [chairman of opposition Alliance of Young Democrats - Hungarian Civic Alliance, (Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége - Magyar Polgári Szövetség, abbreviation Fidesz - MPSZ)] or the right, and it should now learn to measure itself not against them, but against the world. This gave me the faith why it is worth doing this. It was a great thing. I loved it. It was the best part of my life. Now it [i.e. the faith] comes from the fact that I make history. Not for the history books, I do not give a shit about them. I do not at all care whether we or I personally will be in them. I do not at all care. Will we do something big? Are we going to say: goddammit, some people have come who dared to do it and did not fart around with how they would deal with the travel expenses, fuck it. Some came who did not fart around whether they would have a place in the county government, because they understood that this fucking [prefix 'kurva' used again] country is about something else.

(...)

&gt;The real scandal is, that on who Laci [unknown representative from the socialist party with first name 'László'] is talking about, his gipsy men, they get tenth the quality of the healthcare service I get. And since my mother, my mother's name is known in Pápa [Ferenc Gyurcsány's hometown] and they call her Katus [pet name for 'Katalin'], she also gets better one, fuck me [the original expression used here could be literally translated as 'fucking life', even if the word 'kurva' is used again as a prefix of 'life' instead of 'fucking']! She did not know, what had happened. 'Has the healthcare system improved, my son?' I reply: 'Bullshit, mom! The truth is that they recognize your name.' 

(...)

It created an incredible large scandal. People were especially pissed off about calling the country ""fucking country"" several times as it came across as extremely unpatriotistic, and about the ""we obviously lied"" and ""tricks you don't need to know about"" - i.e. lying about the actual budget balance.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;Anger against immigration is also a minor thing compare to help people.

If continued mass immigration is justified by solidarity, then the people won't say: ""oh, it's ok then!""; they will instead turn against solidarity. Remember that the European social security nets were mostly built in the early 20th century, when they were very homogenous societies. Research indicates that people are less willing to engage in solidarity when they have little in common with the other people. The current anti-immigrant sentiment, usually found in the right wing that's traditionally against solidarity, seems to confirm that.

&gt;Btw, immigrating ""troublemakers"" could easily help by letting them have more freedom and support their task.

Research indicates that people are less willing to engage in solidarity when they have little in common with the other people. The current anti-immigrant sentiment, usually found in the right wing that's traditionally against solidarity, seems to confirm that.

It's a minor point. Sure, there will be a growth in unwillingness to participate in solidatrity, but not as it will remove solidarity from society.

When MPs vote against the party's wishes, they are sometimes expelled from the party's parliament group; then they can either remain independent MPs or join a different party's parliament group. We have PMs that were expelled because they voted *for* the bailout agreement while their party was anti-bailout. There are MPs that were expelled because they voted against the bailout while their party was for the bailout. Then their former parties or their new parties change their position on the bailout and hilarity ensues.

Here's a typical story: [Vasilis Oikonomou](http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/en/Vouleftes/Viografika-Stoicheia/?MPId=1207bcdd-e71f-40f3-9876-df3e37f1f80f) was a MP for [PASOK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PASOK) (single-party government or major coalition partner 2009-2012) and he refused to vote for the first bailout agreement. He was swiftly expelled from the parliamentary group. Him and some other expelled-from-PASOK MPs created an [anti-bailout left-wing party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panhellenic_Citizen_Chariot). Then, he left that to create his [own thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Citizens). Then, he joined [DIMAR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIMAR), a moderate left-wing party (which was formed as a splinter from the much dreaded in international cycles SYRIZA). He was made a parliamentary group leader for DIMAR and the party joined the current government as a junior coalition partner. That leaves him faced everyday with the Sisyphean task of trying to explain to everyone why the bailout and more austerity are necessary.

Another story: [Ntora Bakogianni](http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/en/Vouleftes/Viografika-Stoicheia/?MPId=6e037ced-1cd5-495c-838d-ee65ff9e0d7f) was a prominent member of ND (was main opposition party during 2009-2012 and is now major coalition partner). She voted for the first bailout, which was against ND's official party line at the time. She was expelled, made [her own pro-bailout neo-liberal party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_%28Greece%29). In the meantime, ND joined the government as a junior coalition partner but retaining their anti-bailout stance. Then, ND won the first 2012 elections, with a pro-euro stance (and some promises of bailout terms re-negotiation). Between the two elections, Ntora returned to ND and disbanded her own party. No one has ever talked where in the pro-anti bailout spectrum that leaves any of them. 

Now, imagine how we have dozens of similar stories with MPs expelled from their party, then moved to other parties, then joining other parties in the past few years. ",0,1345545928,null,0,1345546174,0,c5wfscp,t3_yjgth,t1_c5wfscp,t3_yjgth,null,1429695609,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

It is the same, but (mostly) to a lesser degree if you remove the foreskin. One looses feeling/nerve ends. It is genital mutilation, and the fact that the people who do it to their children don't want to call it so, doesn't make it less genital mutilation. 

There are a lot of words that have been fought about this way. Things that might be called rape in one culture, is not in another (or, what one person calls rape is not what another person calls rape,  I think you can find people in every prison who claims ""it was not rape, she asked for it etc"")

Nevertheless, if you cut of your childs genitals for no medical reason that leads to less feeling and harming of the nerve ends, that is genital mutilation, no matter the sex of the child. I always refer to it as that, because that is what it is.

But hey, at least we have politicians who speak English :)

Austrias favourite tan boy and BZO politician Stefan Petzner messes up an interview in state TV about his involvement in yet another corruption case in Austria ([Interview in German on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=lub9Sqboexs)), instead of answering the questions he's talking about other cases from other parties (typical ""they did it too"" shit), right after the interview he tweeted ""ich gebs offen zu das interview habe ich versemmelt. shit happens sorry"" (I openly admit it, I fucked that up). Yes, you did ""versemmelt"" it, of course this tweet is deleted now.

But the right wing in Karinthia is always funny, Uwe Scheuch stepped back as head of his party FPK (Freiheitliche in Kärnten a new subparty of the FPÖ which is a splitter party of the Karinthian BZÖ which is a splitterparty of the FPÖ) and gives the position to Kurt Scheuch, his brother. I don't know if Kurt is right for the position, since he somehow seems a bit allergic to cameras and being photographed as demonstrated [here](http://www.k2020.at/2012/08/17/kurt-scheuchs-paparazzi-gate/) (again in German, sorry for that).

How ever if you come to Germany in Feb, you might want to bring some war cloth, because it might be still pretty cold in Germany. A Winter jacket is needed, but not the one you wear on the north pole.

As for work, it really depends on how the company wants you to dress. Even though they cant force you to anything, you should always look out to dress at least casual, which means for me (Male) Leather shoes (office shoes) Jeans (never short) or Business trousers, button down (long sleeve) shirt. - I am having customers though...


I got friends in the PR who do not have any personal contact to customers, they can walk around with flip flops and stuff like that...

Watch what you colleagues do and who they act. If you want customer contact make sure you look serious.

You are not spending the winter season in germany, so you will miss the coldest parts of the year, still i would advise you to bring the clothes you listed. The weather in germany can be unpredictable. IT can get pretty cold, but it can also be very hot in the summer, so you should also prepare for that.
As an intern, people will not be shocked, should you appear to work with informal clothing. However it often depends on the firm, so i can not be sure here. I would say you are never wrong with business casual.

Sorry, I was being sarcastic. Now without mocking this, I do find it insane that they're spending so much time making sure nobody says ""offensive"" things, time which could instead be used to actually deal with important matters regarding crime and justice.

And unfortunately it isn't only in the UK, here in Portugal our police never had that role of ""officers of good manners"" but I was still pretty shocked when I had something called ""Day of National Defence"" (basically a day in which you rather than working or having classes, you spend with the military and they tell you a bit how things work and what to do if you want to join them - this because enforced conscription has been abolished) and, long story short, the officer giving out a presentation said one of the reasons the military should still exist was because of these new e-threats and such and gave as an example that some wannabe hackers vandalized the page of a political party here!

Just think about it, if some kids spray paint a wall, nobody gives a damn, if they're caught then they pay a fine, if not, too bad, but if instead of vandalizing a wall, they vandalize a website nobody visits anyway, then oh my fucking god, better call the military!!

The Constitutional Court introduced the quorum requirement, even though this notion is practically unheard of in most civilized democracies, but Basescu had to be helped to stay in power.                    
Going by the quorum logic, the EU Parliament should be invalidated too, because in EU member countries, EU Parliament elections rarely go over 50%+1 of the voting population.

Going by the 50%+1 votes required to impeach of the 50%+1 quorum principle, Basescu could have been impeached with 4.6 million votes, but Basescu, his party (PDL) have urged their supporters to not attend the referendum vote, arguably showing how much they value democratic ideals.           
            
According to the permanent voter lists, which haven't been changed since 2002, the referendum had a voter presence of almost 47%, not enough to meet the imposed quorum of 50%+1, but the funny thing is that there was a population census a year ago, and the preliminary numbers from that show that if the permanent lists were updated, the quorum was met, and then some. It's going to be tragic and comical when the census results will be released in a couple of months, and everyone will notice that the referendum should have been validated.

true,Abi79,EURO,European Union,"It wasn't democracy which worked here, I'm afraid. First, because the EPP members intervened (of which, we heard quite a lot in the media from Angela Merkel and José Manuel Barroso).

The president's screams of ""coup d'etat!"" were nonsense, but they were heard and acted on by European People's Party members. Why? Because PDL (Democratic Liberal Party - the president's party) is a [member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People%27s_Party#Membership) of the EPP. Thus, they discouraged the new government from changing the impeachment law.

Secondly, because people did not go to vote. The president (Băsescu) encouraged his Romanian supporters not to go and vote, and Viktor Orbán (another EPP member) did the same with the Hungarians in Romania (we have a pretty large number of Hungarians here). To be validated, I believe only &lt;5% more people (of those who are able to vote) were missing.

Overall, it's a pretty shameful event in Romania's history. We have a president who was impeached, who said that he would never ask of people to stay at home, and did that exact thing once he realized the odds were not in his favour. He is still a president only because the law was made so that the votes of a significant majority could be ignored.

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"&gt;The Constitutional Court introduced the quorum requirement, even though this notion is practically unheard of in most civilized democracies, but Basescu had to be helped to stay in power.

He said in 2007 that the ""Quorum is an abuse"". How exactly was it it introduced to help him then?

Oh, and from what I've read, the need for a quorum is part of the Referendum Law ever since its adoption in 2000.

&gt;Going by the quorum logic, the EU Parliament should be invalidated too, because in EU member countries, EU Parliament elections rarely go over 50%+1 of the voting population.

No. The logic of the quorum is that it is needed when exceptional things have to be voted on (like a presidential impeachment). Europarliamentary elections are not extraordinary in any way. 

Wanting to impeach a president is an extraordinary event, breaking a 5-year mandate, and the quorum is there to help ensure that impeachment isn't used too carelessly, whenever the opposition feels like it.

&gt;According to the permanent voter lists, which haven't been changed since 2002

The current Government (Anti-Basescu) could have attempted to change them before launching the impeachment. You can't cry foul after that.

&gt;but the funny thing is that there was a population census a year ago, and the preliminary numbers from that show that if the permanent lists were updated, the quorum was met, and then some.

Then the impeachers should have waited until the new numbers become valid. You cannot validate a referendum today with numbers that will become official two month from now (or whenever they become official). That's not how it works.

You might have moral arguments against Basescu, but according to the law - and we do strive for a law-based society, to a whim-based one - he is still president. I bit the bullet when he became president again (I did not vote for him), and accepted the fact that he'll be president for 5 more years.

And? So it takes time. It's not as difficult to build those connections when everyone speaks the same language. I still don't think that's evidence for what you're claiming.

&gt;However, from a communautarian POV it's not: what you do and don't do inevitably affects the community (and vice versa), so it's not really an option not to remain on speaking terms with it: you have to know what's going on (at the very least to participate in the democratic process). Conversely, in general European countries also tend to offer more solidarity. It's tied together.

You're right, this is a typically European thought and to be completely frank, it's often based on racism. There are huge Turkish communities in my city, with their own newspapers, community organizations etc. People can give and get information entirely in Turkish if they want. Not to mention we English speakers who can live here for years and not speak a lick of German.  So even someone who only speaks, say, Turkish can still very much participate in a community. My personal opinion is that everyone should learn the language of the country they're in, but not to appease the natives.  As far as the democratic process, I can't even vote here because I'm not a citizen.  And need to pay hundreds of euros if I want to be one.

&gt;Compare the international rankings of average education quality.

Sure, we'll go with the Pisa studies.  According to them, we have more people with secondary level education. Personally, I don't think that's a sign of education (uni isn't the only place to learn). So there's that.

We sucked in Math and were above average in Reading and Science.  In fact we did better than Germany in Reading.  I don't put a lot of faith in standardized testing, but I don't think we did that badly. Even in science, we were in ahead of several European countries.

I get really sick of hearing how bad American schools are from people who've never been to them. There are things we're better at and things we're not great at, but based on the amount of American imports Europeans are buying, business-wise we're doing just fine.  

I think it makes Europe feel better to believe that the US is somehow stupid or uncultured compared to them. Every country in Europe has it's share of crazies. We just have more people and a media that focuses on the negative.

true,dudewithpants,null,null,"&gt;In the 1890s, it became a popular technique to prevent, or cure, masturbatory insanity. In 1891 the president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England published On Circumcision as Preventive of Masturbation, and two years later another British doctor wrote Circumcision: Its Advantages and How to Perform It, which listed the reasons for removing the 'vestigial' prepuce. Evidently the foreskin could cause 'nocturnal incontinence,' hysteria, epilepsy, and irritation that might 'give rise to erotic stimulation and, consequently, masturbation.'

&gt;At the same time circumcisions were advocated on men, clitoridectomies (removal of the clitoris) were also performed for the same reason (to treat female masturbators). The US ""Orificial Surgery Society"" for female ""circumcision"" operated until 1925, and clitoridectomies and infibulations would continue to be advocated by some through the 1930s. As late as 1936, L. E. Holt, an author of pediatric textbooks, advocated male and female circumcision as a treatment for masturbation.

&gt;One of the leading advocates of circumcision was John Harvey Kellogg. He advocated the consumption of Kellogg's corn flakes to prevent masturbation, and he believed that circumcision would be an effective way to eliminate masturbation in males.

&gt;**In 1949, a lack of consensus in the medical community as to whether circumcision carried with it any notable health benefit motivated the United Kingdom's newly formed National Health Service to remove infant circumcision from its list of covered services.**

All elections are important, you can't say that one is less important than the other, it's undemocratic to presume as such. A vote represents the voice of a person, and saying that an electoral exercise has higher importance than another is wrong in my opinion.

It still takes time anyhow, and you need to recover after every move. In addition, there's more concern for your standing in the community if you know you're not going to move for decades.

&gt;You're right, this is a typically European thought and to be completely frank, it's often based on racism.

Explain.

&gt;So even someone who only speaks, say, Turkish can still very much participate in a community.

And that's a problem: that way you get many communities who live next to each other, and reach different conclusions about the same problems. As a result, most people are going to be unhappy with the result of the political process (look eg. what happens in the USA, which has many fractures along religious and ethnic community lines: everyone single community has other communities that it considers nuts, and national politics are hopelessly adversarial and trusted by no one as a result).

&gt;My personal opinion is that everyone should learn the language of the country they're in, but not to appease the natives. As far as the democratic process, I can't even vote here because I'm not a citizen. 

It's not a matter of ritual appeasement, it's a matter of practical ability to run a democracy. And voting is just the formal aspect, informing yourself, articulating an opinion and exchanging ideas with others is the essence.

&gt;I get really sick of hearing how bad American schools are from people who've never been to them.

I base myself on complaints of Americans :)

Anyway, the ""can't put Iraq on the map"" example was to question that Americans ""are more open to learn about other cultures"". As any dominant culture, they seem to forget that that dominance gives them an overwhelming presence on other cultures, and that other people will adopt spontaneously or willingly, because they already know many features of that culture. That's much less of a given in, say, Lithuania. Many people in Europe are much more aware that they live in just a small country in a big world.

As another example, take the knowledge of foreign languages:

&gt; ""A pervasive lack of knowledge about foreign cultures and foreign languages threatens the security of the United States as well as its ability to compete in the global marketplace and produce an informed citizenry.""

http://www.ncssfl.org/papers/BenefitsSecondLanguageStudyNEA.pdf

&gt;I think it makes Europe feel better to believe that the US is somehow stupid or uncultured compared to them. 

That's beyond doubt. That doesn't imply it's necessarily entirely untrue.

Would you be shocked that most circumcised women, even those that have gone through the worst possible forms of the procedure feel the same way? They embrace the practice as a boon and inflict it upon their daughters in turn. 

&gt;If I weren't circumcised, I probably would have had it done later in life...

What would you bet on this? Even in the US where circumcision is very prevalent, adult circumcision is extremely rare. Statistically, had you been left intact you'd have gone on to enjoy your foreskin like any other man without giving it a second thought. 

&gt;It may have started as an anti-masturbation thing, but that is pretty inaccurate... as evidenced by the ridiculous amount of times that I have bated.

Did you know that men with no penises at all can still orgasm through prostate stimulation?

You have no choice but to defend it if you want to maintain your current self-image—that's a pretty huge incentive. Men *have* to believe that we have the best possible penis; the biggest, the hardest, the prettiest cock in all of creation. There are few things we love as much yet at the same time are as insecure about as our cocks. 

Admitting that circumcision is a bad thing brings all sorts of uncomfortable logical implications. It would mean that your cock is not the best it could have been, that your parents *chose* to subject you to penis reduction surgery and so on. Why would any man choose to embrace that truth when all around them are millions of others ready to validate the beliefs that would allow him retain his self-image?

true,Eryemil,ESPA,Spain,"&gt;I find female circumcision to be much more scary as it's the equivalent of cutting a male's glans. 

Not all forms of female genital mutilation involve the removal of the external clitoris and there are more severe forms of male genital mutilation than the one you're probably aware of. 

You can't just compare the worst form of FGM to a middle-of-the-road form of MGM. 

&gt;The majority of women get off only through clitoral stimulation, **so most circumcised females never orgasmed.**

That seems like a pretty bold claim. Obviously the excision of the external clitoris must have a deep impact on their sexuality but most circumcised women, like most circumcised men, tend to say that they can enjoy sex just fine. 

Men can orgasm just from stimulation of the prostate if they're horny enough, wouldn't the same apply to the internal structure of the clitoris? It seems counteractive that an organ that is incidentally erogenous would do a better job of it than one evolved specifically to provide pleasure.

For example, right after the referendum, the entire Prosecution institution of Romania organized massive interventions in villages to ""investigate"" suspicions of voting fraud. There were cases in which people were asked to swear on the Bible, inside their homes, that they didn't double vote and others were carried to police HQ even if there was no clear evidence they had done anything. Basically it was intimidation in its purest form.

For the elections in 2009, when Basescu won his second term at a difference of only 70.000 votes, there were hundreds more complaints about voting frauds, yet very few of them have been investigated yet. And now, with fewer complaints, the state's prosecutors organised such a massive effort, probably in an attempt to seed the doubt that no way there were 7.4 million people that wanted Basescu gone. 

These suspicions towards the intent of the prosecutors are also sustained by the fact that the Head Prosecutor has been named and re-named by Basescu in her seat and if he would go down, she would go down. Also, the head of the Anti-Corruption Division has been named by Basescu and even more, his 2 terms expired in January this year, but has since been re-named as ""temporary"" head 3 times, by the same Basescu.

Usually you traval by bus in Spain and avoid the trains, except you happen to get on one of these new high-speed trains.

Top-cities/places to visit would be (+granada of course, visit the alhambre as early in the mornign as you can. Tickets can be bought online and at ATMs, google it):
*Sierra nevada:* From the top of the pico veleta you can see the coast of africa on good days. It's an easy trip if you use the bus, just a small walk to the top. Some girls go there in flipflops, so not really hard to do. But it will be cold up there, even in the hottest summer. There are several other great hikes in sierra nevada . On the southern end of sierra nevada, visit Bubión and Trevelez, these are really beautiful villiges in the hills.
*Cordoba:* Mezquita de Cordoba, one of the world's biggest mosques, now a christian Cathedral. Mind-blowing building
*Sevialla:* Crypt of Christopher Columbus in the Cathedral, really nice old town centre
*Lisbon:* Great city in every way, culture, history, architecture, party (Maybe too long to drive, i lived in the middel of lisbon and granada)
*Cadiz:* One of the top surfspots in Europe
*Gibraltar:* Yay, british rock :D
*Jaen, Ubeda, Baeza:* Nice villages, world heritage.

In general, you can wear whatever you like and you won't be stared at (unless it's Borat's mankini).

That's pretty much what i wear to work and sometimes for going out. For the fanciest night clubs shirt or polo can be needed as well as long trousers and dark shoes, but for more informal occasions t-shirt, jeans or shorts are perfect.


*I have heard Spain frowns on shorts*


Nothing like that, unless at work or with some old-fashioned professors at university (&lt;1%). Tomorrow we are expected to hit 40ºC (~104F) in Madrid, so yes, they are a must. In winter you probably won't need them except for sports, etc, and perhaps in some exceptionally warm days.


*what about styles like American Eagle t-shirts (polos mostly)?*


They are a common sight at work places in summer. For going out they can be associated to the ""pijos"", something equivalent to ""preppy"" or ""posh"" kids, although it doesn't have to be like that. On a personal note though, i prefer shirt :)


*Also I heard that most Spaniards wear dark colors*
