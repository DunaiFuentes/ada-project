The question is then whether the advantage in the boom years is worth the extra instability when things go wrong. Britain doing relatively well is proof that the EMU is not vital for prosperity. You seem to be saying that Britain would have done much better had it stayed within the EMU process*, which seems unlikely given we were already doing quite a lot better, and crowing about being 'the savior of Europe' etc, as I recall.

As for Britain 'holding together the EU', I'd argue its an issue of politics rather than economics. Clearly a European organization could get by without British tax money or economic heft, such as it is. But forcing Britain out marks a shift in European governance, away from consensus and towards a more assertive 'are you in or are you out' mentality. I'd argue that Britain at the moment provides cover as a kind of whipping boy for a lot of other countries with similar, albeit perhaps less strong objections. And that this dynamic of 'in or out' will apply just as much to the next country in line as it does to Britain. And I'm personally uneasy about an organization which is supposed to be promoting peace exercising power in such a naked way. Is it not antithetic to those aims to have 2/3rds of Europe integrated and centralized, with that group leveraging its economic power over the rest?

It's very difficult to enact environmental regulation when competing companies in other countries don't have the same restrictions, and still are able to sell their products in yours. And since those rules and regulations need to be decided on somehow, you need supranational institutions that can make decisions that are binding for all members.

Or, if you prefer this angle, how would individual European countries be able to stand up against pressure from the US to adopt some retarded policies? The EU failed to do that as a whole in matters of flight passenger data or international bank transfers, but I'm pretty sure that individually, we'd have SOPA at home. The US can do just fine without trading with, say, Belgium, but the EU as a whole is the largest market in the world.

Edit: We are in a customs union with Turkey, btw., but they're not a part of the common market. The EFTA countries are, however, and that's why they have to adopt the decisions made in Brussels. And there still are duties on goods when you trade with EFTA countries -- that's why Norway had their butter shortage, and why Swiss customs might check your car but not your papers.

Edit II: Oh, and fisheries? Fish stocks don't care about national borders. If the French would have to explain to their fishermen why they'd have quotas their UK competitors with access to the same market don't have, then the seas would be empty.",0,1325913975,null,0,true,0,c3eqqdt,t3_o5h5l,t1_c3eqqdt,t1_c3eqf90,null,1428137618,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

It is quite simple actually: The western world is dominated by the English language. Not because it is intrinsically better then other languages, but because of sheer number of native English speakers, because of colonial history and because of the economic dominance of the US in the post WW2 era. The fact that the US has by far the largest customer base leads directly to the creation and dominance of the biggest movie and music production companies. It is more or less mainly a matter of numbers. The UK piggybacks on this.

This lead to a dominance of English speaking films, music and books. The rate of translations of books from European languages to English far lower then what is translated from English into the much smaller non-English markets. When was the last time you watched an non-English movie? Read a translated novel? Probably never. But I guess you just ""know"" that the French can't do any good movies. Just as you ""know"" that Germans have no sense of humour. Since you don't speak any of these languages you will never know otherwise, but that is good since they are shit anyway, right?!

Oh, and the universities? Ever heard of the ""citation-index""? It is one of the most important aspects of these dubious university rankings. It measures how often a paper published from a foreign university is being quoted.

The numbers can be seen a bit more clearly at these links,

http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/interest-rate

http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/interest-rate

And perhaps they are better expressed by saying the euro interest rate was between some 25% and 50% lower than where the UK thought that rate should be during the UK boom, including the UK property boom that was and still is just crazy.

So if the UK had been able to exercise it's ""fair"" influence on euro interest rates, to keep things easy lets call that c.10% of where the euro interest rate number should be,

Then 10% of the 25 and 50 number is obviously 2.5 or 5 so, very roughly speaking, the UK would probably have had interest rates that were c. 22.5 % or 45% off where they probably should have been, for a UK context.

This fundamental structural imbalance is why the pound was lucky enough to fall out of the ERM in 1992.

It is also a very significant contributory factor to why the South and Ireland are suffering so badly while Germany booms and the German satellite economies of Austria, Netherlands and Finland are doing pretty well.

Du wirst aber niemals einen Polizisten oder Arbeitgeber finden, der sagt: ""Du sollst heute länger im Büro bleiben"". Wenn es sich um eine direkte Aufforderung handelt, ist der direkte Imperativ viel gebräuchlicher (""Bleib heute länger im Büro""), wahrscheinlich wird er es aber höflichkeitshalber als Bitte formulieren (""Könntest du heute länger im Büro bleiben?""), mit dem impliziten Verständnis, dass es sich um eine Aufforderung handelt.

In der Tat drückt ""sollte"" dann eher eine persönliche Meinung aus, leider finde ich es aber recht schwierig, hier einen klaren Trennstrich zwischen allen Bedeutungsnuancen zu ziehen. Du musst dich einfach länger mit der Sprache beschäftigen und die Bedeutung der Worte jeweils aus dem Gebrauchskontext erschließen, mit der Zeit verstehst du dann auch intuitiv, wann die Verwendung eines Wortes angebracht ist, und wann nicht.

Ich bin Muttersprachler, natürlich haben wir Deutsch auch in der Schule gelernt, diese grammatikalischen Feinheiten kann ich aber in der Genauigkeit nicht mehr wiedergeben. Sicher geht es dir mit Englisch ähnlich: Du weißt, dass etwas stimmt, kannst es aber nicht mehr begründen.

Um noch auf das verlinkte Beispiel einzugehen: ""Du sollst nicht lügen"" ist in diesem Fall ein Gebot (""Thou shalt not lie""), das als moralischer Leitsatz angesehen werden kann. Verwendung findet der Satz als Zitat aus der Bibel, oder wenn eine Mutter ihr Kind ermahnt - er ist sehr absolut gehalten und lässt keinen Spielraum für weitere Möglichkeiten. Hingegen ist die Aussage ""Man sollte nicht lügen"" viel differenzierter, wie auch im Englischen: ""You should not lie"" lässt Raum für die Auslegungsmöglichkeit, dass Lügen zwar eigentlich schlecht ist, es aber möglicherweise manchmal unausweichlich ist. In diesem Fall handelt es sich eher um eine Richtlinie, einen Vorschlag, aber keine absolute Maxime. Man könnte diesen Aspekt noch betonen, wenn man sagt: ""*Eigentlich* sollte man nicht lügen.""

Dann direkt links von dem Rathaus ist das Kino!  Oder sollen wir besser sagen: das Ministerium für Propaganda!  Hier kann Bürger Filmen über wie herrlich ich bin! Natürlich!  Und es gibt da ein kleiner Tierladen (für Kinder!).  

Dann unter diesem ist das Wohngebiet!  Mit leicht Zugang zum Kino!  Sehr unterhalsam.  Das Wohngebiet hat auch leicht Zugang zum Hafen (der einzige Weg um die Stadt zu verlassen!  Weil es von Wüste umgeben ist!)  Dort wohnt Waräger Garde (Varangian Guard).  Es gibt ein wöchentlich Plünderungen um sie zu Glücklich behalten.  Die Bürger kennen schon ihre Verpflichtungen!  

Zwischen dem Wohngebiet und der Schule ist ein Safari Parcours.  Kinder können nicht zur Schule gehen wenn sie nicht durch dieses Gebiet gehen können.  Nur der Stärkste!  Mein Stadt is natürlich inspiriert durch Sparta!  

Dann haben wir das Altenheim in der oberen linken Ecke!  Komplett mit Friedhof (um sie traurig zu behalten!).  Der Polizeirevier hat ein ""Skywalk"" für wenn die Senioren versuchen zu rebellieren!  Es ist merhmals geschehen!  Ich schwöre es euch!  

Rechts zur Polizeirevier haben wir mein Herrenhaus, aus reines Gold!  Und unter dem haben wir Kirche für selbst Gottesdienst.  Nur Ich darf betreten!  

Die Bürger in meine Stadt sind sehr glücklich und sie vergottern mich!  Und natürlich!  Ich bin der Bürgermeister!

In a normal situation it would be required of these blogs to post sources, proofs. But no, the whole liberal media and blogosphere is doing a circlejerk, posting and re-posting half-truths and examining all the happening in Hungary trough a very narrow viewpoint.

Some points:

&gt;how many days the New Theatre's leftist director, Istvan Marta, has left before he is forcibly evicted 

Theater directors are changed around, and the mayor of Budapest, as owner and financier of the theaters, has the right to appoint directors. At the elections in 2010 every theater director remained the same as was previously. Since that time two directors were changed, and the change was in one of the classical leftist theater too. That appointed director was not objected by the left-liberals.

&gt;He is to be replaced by a dramatist notorious for his anti-Semitic views and an actor who recently campaigned for Hungary's neo-fascist Jobbik party.

This is a misunderstanding, error. There are actually two people involved in this story, and this sentence mixes them up into one.

&gt;There are hard times indeed for those in Hungary who like to think of themselves as enlightened, liberal, or even remotely left-wing.

There are 15 theaters managed by the city of Budapest, one director was replaced with someone who was acceptable to the left-liberals. But one is apparently not acceptable to them, which resulted in them demonstrating. It isn't any kind of ""hard times"".

&gt;Budapest's New Theatre will start a new season with more patriotic Hungarian plays very different from classics like Don Carlo

Yes, the new director specifically got his mandate to show plays from Hungarian authors. Considering this is one theater from many, it is just fair that there is a theater dedicated to maintaining own culture.

&gt;Hungary's right-wing populist government hit the headlines this week over its plans to impose draconian controls on the Hungarian central bank

Watch the adjectives: ""right-wing populist"", ""draconian"". Where would blogs be without sensationalist adjectives. 

There was one point which was objected by the EU commision, and which the government still wanted. The proposal was, that there would be a third vice president to the central bank. The mandate of the third president would not end, when the current presidents mandate ends, and could continue working with the newly appointed president. The current president would remain in charge until his mandate runs out. And the function of the third VP would be completely determined by the current president. So if he didn't like the VP, he could just put him into an office, to do nothing.

&gt;It has embarked on a Kulturkampf – a cultural revolution – which seems bent on imposing its right-wing and xenophobic ideology on all walks of life, ranging from minorities and religions to the media, judiciary and arts.

This sentence has everything. 

* So the proof of the Kulturkampf is one appointed theater director. 
* ""Xenophobic"" - i don't know where this is from, we don't like the Austrian banks for what they did to us, and a large part of population could not learn a foreign language even if forced, but other than that i don't see any xenophoby. 
* ""minorities"" - it is the socialist voters (since 2010 they are now Jobik's voters) who are hating the Gypsies. Among the Roma, it is Fidesz who has the most support, and Fidesz has 3 EU parliament representatives. It is these ""liberal"" people who are actually derogating on the PM, by telling that he is a Gypsy. Even if he were (which is not), it shouldn't matter.
* ""religions"" - this probably tries to take aim at the new law that serves to remove tax-exemption from those churches which are just tax-evasion schemes, and not authentic churches. Note that you can practice any religion freely in Hungary, its just the tax-exemption that is limited to those churches, that do charitable work.
* ""media"" - The biggest ""sin"" of the media law is that it merged all media related state institutions into a single one. When the state has to do austerity, you can expect steps like this. A single institution is just simpler to maintain effectively. All the other objections were implemented right at the time when the EU evaluation was made.
* ""judiciary"" - There was a reform, the Hungarian courts were working notoriously slow. By comparison, the bordering Romania has laws which guarantee faster working courts. The reform aims to reduce the ""lag"" of the courts, and speed up processing of cases. 

&gt;The new constitution also withdraws official recognition from over 300 religious denominations, including Islam, Buddhism and several Catholic orders.

This is not true at all. A popular lie in blogs is this newest bend on mixing up religions and churches. Practicing any religion is free in Hungary. Religions are not ""recognized"" by the state, and they do not require any recognition to be practiced freely. Previously there were over 300 registered churches, which got tax-exemption. The relatively easy process of registering churches resulted in churches being established, which had their only function of participating in tax-evasion schemes. The new law requires of churches to show support from 1000 individuals, and to pass a review, which shows that its a genuine church, and not a tax-evasion construct. 

I could go on commenting on the article further (it has some more errors and exaggerations), but it is futile. I don't think that truth even matters any more.

true,Gibbon_Ka,HESW,Hessen,"I've never been to the US, so I don't know if that's news to you or even helpful but here are some of the quirks of everyday German life:

* Get used to rye bread. We eat it all day errday. 

* Get used to public transportation. If you end up in any of those three cities you mentionend or another one of equal size, there will be no real need for a car. Subway, busses and trains get you everywhere, a ticket is included in your student ID and everybody uses it. 

* Germans are big on recycling. Having at least three trash cans for normal waste, plastic and paper is common. Glas is also separated or brought back to the store for refund. 

* You will get most things for everyday life in the supermarket (Rewe) just as anywhere else. Turkish grocery shops often have superior vegetable selections and butcheries for a small price. You just need to find them. 
Germans are big on ""biological"" also. Every supermarket will have a section with biological produced veggies. 
I understand that our products use way less sugar than American ones. Dunno, you have to see for yourself.

* Fastfood options are more limited. McD, BK, KFC basically. Subway is starting to get a foothold, Pizza Hut on the decline. Starbucks is everywhere but most coffee places are small shops with less variance. 
If you get the craving and are in the Frankfurt area, there is a [PX in Wiesbaden] (http://wikimapia.org/9028955/Hainerberg-P-X).

* Pack some weatherproof clothes and boots. It rains a lot during the year.

* There will be University clubs for many sports and activites but they don't have that standing they have in America. There will be just as many clubs in your area outside of Uni. An easy way to meet some people outside of it.

* Learn the basic rules of soccer. And call it football. ;) In the summer of '12 you will see us getting crazy with the European Championship. It will also be the only time you'll see us really sporting our national colors and singing the anthem. 
Never support Bayern Munich, regardless of what your coworkers might say.

* The Turks are our Blacks. As in *biggest minority with the most stereotypes and prejudices floating around*. You will see prejudice, racial slurs, 'ghetto behaviour' and general bullshit. Please don't engage in it and don't encourage it. 
* Germans have a complicated relationship with their history. In general don't take it lightheartedly. Don't joke about it until you know the people around you really well.

* possibly more a reddit thing than different to Texan everyday life: we don't care about religion. Nobody wants to discuss that and what you do in your free time is your thing. 
* If you'll end up in Frankfurt: It's okay and expected of you to hate Offenbach. Don't go there, it's a silly place ;)

Your University experience can drastically differ depending on field and professors. Expect it to be a bit more self-depended in scheduling your things, organizing lab usage etc. You are responsible for your own stuff. Then again, everybody at your Uni will speak English and I'd bet many will be willing to help you with everything as long as you ask them politely.

- Just because you eat rye bread, doesn't mean everyone does. There are dozens of bread types in a local area, hundreds all of Germany. If you don't want rye bread, you don't have to eat it.
- Depending on the distances you also use a bike. In smaller towns students sometimes never take public transport.
- Rewe ist just one supermarket chain. Nothing special about it. There is a dozen others. You get the cheapest prices and normally good quality at Aldi (They own Trader Joes BTW)
- From my experience, Subway is pretty common, KFC quite rare. Starbucks is also quite rare. There are a lot coffee shops already in Germany. BK/McD is everywhere. The rest depends on the city. But the fast foods options are not limited, unless you only want American fast food. In Germany pizza is popular and there are also tons of Döner shops. A good time to widen your horizon.
- Or just buy the clothes here in Germany.
- Or just skip football. Also, nothing wrong with Bayern Munich. Obviously you are some other clubs fanboy :P Other fans will say the same about your club.
- You can joke about Germany history, just don't make nazi salutes or shout nazi paroles :)

PhD students either have a stipend or (more commonly) a salaried position at the professor's chair, usually paid for by research projects (e.g. EU funding). We do not take classes or exams. It's more like you have a research job and you're doing your PhD on the side. In most cases, the topics of your PhD and the research project you're working on will of course be aligned, but this is not always the case. This basically means that doing a PhD is tied to having a job at the professor's chair. Consequently, you have to apply for your PhD like you would apply for a job. 

Of course, there are exceptions. If you have a stipend (e.g. DAAD) you don't need the job and many professor's will be happy to take you. I also think that there are more graduate schools than there used to be. Those are much like the US programs, as far as I know.

I was seriously considering some schools for a PhD program, but unlike the US where I can jump right into a PhD program, in Germany I'm pretty sure I'd have to do MS---&gt;PhD, and if I ended up leaving after the 2 years for a Masters, start another 5 over somewhere else for a PhD.

&gt;How are the PhD / grad programs there different from the US?

Sorry, if I confused you. There are three stages of higher education (Bachelor, master's and PhD) in Germany just like in USA. But in USA master's and PhD are mostly combined into a single program (takes 4 to 6 years, is that correct?) and sometimes you can't get only a master's degree AFAIK. In Germany it's more like bachelor and master's are combined together, although you can obtain these degrees separately too. And to my knowledge there is no programs offering master+PhD combined. This holds for engineering, natural sciences, maths, comp. science etc. Master's degree takes 2 years and PhD takes 3 to 5 years depending on where and in which field you do your studies.

Being also a foreigner here, I can always recommend doing master's and PhD in Germany. PhD wages in Germany is higher and you have less teaching duties compared to USA. I haven't experienced those personally but that's what I hear. Plus health care system is quite good.

On top of those, living in another country, surely, brings you a lot of experience and also vision I would say. But that's just a matter of taste.

The difference seems subtle, but it manifests itself when you're navigating the bureaucracy.  
In the end, that any credits you've earned are actually recorded is your responsibility. If you lack a grade or a signature, it's up to you to chase after the teaching staff to get it, and if something gets lost or goes wrong, you're the one who ultimately has to make sure that it gets fixed. Don't expect any reminders for deadlines, and don't mistake your university for a service provider that will treat you like a customer.  
Don't let this scare you off either, though, millions of students manage to handle this just fine, you can talk to people, and even if you end up with a letter saying you've been exmatriculated for not paying your enrollment fee for the semester in time, there is a good chance that this can be fixed.  
Be nice to the secretaries, they're the (often only) ones who know how everything works and usually they really want to help you. If a professor says one thing, and a secretary says something else, the secretary is ~~almost~~ certainly right.

Avoid dorms, find a room in a shared apartment (""WG"") instead (easy in Leipzig, which btw. is *much* cheaper to live in than the other two, not so much in Frankfurt, and *if* you manage to find something with a roof in Munich you should probably take it).  
Having nice roommates is much more important than location, size of the room, or any other factor that might make an alternative seem like the better choice. This advice probably isn't country specific, though.

Stores will be closed on Sundays and on holidays, and there are many holidays in Germany that unexpectedly sneak up on you in the middle of the week *just* when you're about to run out of food, so keep an eye on [this table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Germany).

true,rpad,null,null,"I hate doing this too. Replying to assumptions, but here you go:

&gt;There are very critical articles about the situation in Hungary in respected left and right wing newspapers all over Europe

That is why a call this a circlejerk, and reposting stuff from one another. How many of these newspapers have their own Hungarian speaking reporters, who actually read the laws that they criticize? Most of them read something published by Hungarian journalists in English, or have their long standing links from where they get their news. The media in Hungary is very politicized, you are mistaking if you think you can get unbiased reports.

&gt;You are clearly lying when you say, that the socialists are voting for Jobbik.

What i said, is that former socialists voters are the majority of the current Jobbik voters. In 2010 the socialists have lost a large part of their voter base, that voter base has went over to Jobbik. Jobbik has gained much in traditionally strong socialist areas (north, and east), and has gained little in the traditionally Fidesz area (west). Contrary to previous occasions, when the far-right was ""eating away voters"" from Fidesz, this time the far-right was eating away voters from the socialists. The reason for this was the anti-Gypsy rhetoric of Jobbik. I mention this, so just to put the blame to where it belongs.

&gt;The media policy and the undermining of democratic rights of your Government is harshly condemned by social democratic and conservative Governments in Europe alike.

A lot of people criticized the media law, most of them who never read it. There was a round of EU commission review of the law, after which all objections were implemented. There is study about the media law (its linked to Reddit too), which summarizes that ""Hungarian media law should not refer to European practices, since it is not in line with European practices"". But if you read it in detail, all the objections come down to a single point ""there are media authorities in Europe with more power than the Hungarian media authority, but those are separate institutions, and not a single authority like the Hungarian"". Exactly what i wrote, the ""sin"" of the media authority is that it is a single organization, and not multiple, fragmented organizations. The truth is, i don't think Fidesz lawmakers even considered this as a factor. You can save money by reducing state organizations, so lets put together the two media authority branches into one. 

&gt;At the same time you have huge demonstrations in Hungary

There were 100 thousand protesters, according to the organizers. During demonstrations against the socialists, there was one election rally, where much more people were present, the only time when that was surpassed, was in 1989. It is always the rule, that the party in power has the parliament, and the opposition has the streets. I have heard what some of the protesters were saying, and tho there are points with which i agree, they were repeating the false accusations too. It does not make them any service either if they are shown on TV quoting obvious lies.

&gt;Your post sounds like everything is a-ok, though.

Its not ok, but its not ok to argue by quoting lies either. So far, the EU was a constructive partner in revising the laws, the opposition is not. It doesn't matter for the opposition if its true or not, the only thing the matters, is that the bigger the hysteria around the government, the better for them. Just an example, yesterday one of the leading socialist politicians starter raising panic by telling that ""the government wants to take your bank accounts"", to which some started moving their money to Austrian banks. Now this accusation is not just false, but it even merits a punishable offense of raising ""bank panic"". Foreign currency reserves are higher than ever, so Hungary is far from becoming bankrupt, and the forint is far from being worthless. This move even woke up the central bank chief from his slumber. But it was a good lesson, by the evening that same socialist politician held a press conference saying that ""the bank accounts are safe"". At least he will learn what responsibility is, and where the red line is. 

&gt;group of former political dissidents who opposed communist rule until its overthrow

There is a whole political side (the free liberals -SZDSZ) that had part in changing the communist regime. But that side in 1994 made a pact with the socialists, a remained their allies ever after. There is another party, MDF, which was also part of the regime change 1989, and which has now also vanished. There are a lot of people who had a role in 1989, but who are now without any political affiliation.

&gt;The new constitution unwinds the checks and balances

Those checks and balances didn't help the country to not be corrupted during the socialist government. The logic of Fidesz is, that it is the socialists who were lying about the deficit, and who were able to sell off state property for nothing. So those checks and balances are nice in theory, but have little effect on what happens in reality. The socialists could get around any law if they needed. The constitution was just a nice packaging, hiding the corrupt interior. 

I don't agree with the stance of the protesters, and with Fidesz's pragmatist approach either, but i agree somewhat with László Sólyom (the previous president of the republic). The constitution does have a ""culture"" around it, and that culture does matter too. But as he says, the current constitution does have similar wordings to the old one, and that is the proof that there is constitutional continuity, although Fidesz tried to make a clean slate.

""Solid Gold Herrenhaus"" =&gt; ""Herrenhaus aus (reinem/purem) Gold""
""Skywalk"" =&gt; (Verbindungs-)brücke

&gt; Dann direkt links vom Rathaus ist das Kino! Oder sollen wir besser sagen: das Ministerium für Propaganda! Hier können Bürger Filme darüber sehen, wie herrlich ich bin! Und es gibt da einen kleinen Tierladen (für Kinder)!

Verstehe nicht so recht, was Du mit dem ""Natürlich!"" sagen willst.

&gt; **Darunter** ist dann das Wohngebiet! Mit leicht**em** Zugang zum Kino, sehr unterhaltsam. Das Wohngebiet hat auch leichten Zugang zm Hafen (der einzige Weg (um) die Stadt zu verlassen, da sie von Wüste umgeben ist!) Dort wohnt die **Warägergarde**. Es gibt wöchentliche Plünderungen um sie glücklich zu halten - die Bürger kennen ihre Verpflichtungen!

Von er Warägergarde habe ich heute das erste Mal gehört, da lerne ich auch noch was hier ;-)  
Alternativ kannst du auch sagen ""Die Bürger wissen schon was gut für sie ist."" um zu implizieren, dass sie die Plünderungen über sich ergehen lassen sollen um Schlimmeres zu verhindern.

&gt; Zwischen dem Wohngebiet und der Schule ist ein Safari-Parcours. Die Kinder können nicht zur Schule gehen, *wenn sie es nicht durch dieses Gebiet schaffen*. *Nur der Stärkste kommt durch*! Meine Stadt ist natürlich von Sparta inspiriert!

""Nur der Stärkste!"" für sich allein macht wenig Sinn, darum habe ich es zu einem ganzen Satz ausgebaut.

&gt; Dann haben wir das Altenheim in der oberen linken Ecke! Komplett mit Friedhof (um sie traurig zu **halten**!). Das Polizeirevier hat eine Verbindungsbrücke zum Altenheim, für den Fall dass die Senioren versuchen zu rebellieren! Das ist schon mehrmals geschehen, ich schwöre es!

&gt; Rechts vom Polizeirevier haben wir mein Herrenhaus aus reinem Gold!Und unter diesem haben wir die Kirche für (persönlichen?) Gottesdienst - nur ich darf sie betreten!

We might have some sympathy if you had gotten it through something like necessary medical bills, but most certainly not like this.

Europe isn't a legal-free space, and leading a normal life without a registered residence would be close to impossible. If you want to come here, do it properly. Any job that would get you a visa would pay well enough to work off that debt, anyway.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ok, within Europe or more accurately the European Union you are free to live or work wherever you want. That means if I can move to Poland or Germany without any real bar to my entry. It also means that the more attractive countries to move to, France, Neatherlands or Denmark for example have very strong immigration laws which are designed to keep a cohesive society and prevent too many freeloaders from outside the EU, like yourself, moving there and also to prevent overpopulation which if you have been to Europe you will know is a serious problem (American friends of mine always comment how close the cities are to each other). 

As governments only let a few tens of thousands of people outside Europe move there why would they let you in? In the UK places are pretty much offered to people with strong family ties which generally enourages people from commonwealth wealth countries with a shared cultural history. They are also offered to very high earners whose presence there means that they subsidise and place limited burden on the state and people with specific skills that lend themselves well to the UK like nursing staff, doctors, translators or academics. Just out of curiousity which of these three categories do you fall into? 

So anyway say you are moving to the UK (I am assuming UK because you speak no other languages and besides it is the one I know most about) you give them your financial details and then you tell the UK boarder control agency that you are fleeing your country because you borrowed money from an oppressive business that callously offered you a student loan. Honestly I expect them to welcome you in with open arms.  Mate, as far as I am concerned you might as well apply for political asylum. An unqualified debtor with no family to support him is certainly the kind of person that I want coming in. Particularly as I have just had university educated, mulit-lingual friends of mine who have been sent back to Pakistan and India after their visas ran out, and other friends who have saved and worked whilst studying to pay £40k to do a masters in order to get the requisit student visa so they could take a gamble at staying here (FYI I am a white and my family is so English that on my mum's side they don't even pronouce the surname in the obvious way and all my cousins have signet rings) Anyway if you really want a way to come to England the easiest way would be to apply to am American company with a small but growing presence like Wholefoods then request transfer. Obviously that would necessitate paying back you student loan but hey you are in the birthplace of liberalism so who cares right? 

edit: - oh and you also have to overcome the cutural changes. You know that cliche about the British sense of humour?

Besides considering that millions of people in the continent speak English fluently as well as their native language and that British pronunciation and grammar is the most highly regarded what is different that you have to offer? It is much easier to teach a language if you yourself had to learn that language from scratch. The education systems in Europe also don't really lend themselves well to amateur teachers, unless you manage to find a job in a private school you will have a problem. 

So my advice is that if you really want to teach, call up a few British public schools and ask them if you can have a job for a year.

Beyond that Allianz and other big insurance companies are based there so I doubt finance jobs are that hard to come by.

As far as size goes Munich is still not very big. It's easy to get to most parts of the city in 20 minutes with the extensive public transit network. It also never feels intimidating. Most neighborhoods have small, short buildings lining the streets.

The weather is also fairly mild with no extremes like scorching Summers or bitter-cold Winters. 

Lastly Munich is gorgeous, full of tons of great culture and history, and it has delicious food and some of the world's best beer. A decent amount of that beer can't be had outside of Munich either.

The cons are price, but as an American I found it typical. I think maybe things are just much cheaper in Germany, so the prices seem very high to them.

I'm pretty modest when it comes to talking about my abilities but, if you must know, I'm a college sophomore and graphic design major. I used to be an engineering major, but I decided it wasn't for me. Unfortunately, that meant that I basically wasted my first year in school. Incidentally, I now have a moderate amount of experience with  Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign as well as AutoCAD and Google Sketchup. I wouldn't say my abilities are where I want them to be yet, but I'm getting there. Furthermore, my presence overseas may be helpful to some of my family members who are in the engineering consulting business. Also, as an even smaller hobby of mine, I write literature. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/mr2vk/i_need_some_help_im_gonna_let_you_guys_decide/) is a small post I made about a few, supposedly unique, concepts. 


I don't want to move exclusively so I can get out of paying debt. Not paying debt, for me, would be a small (and likely, a financially insignificant) bonus to living abroad. It'd merely be icing on the cake. I probably want to move because, after being born in Japan and having almost lived in Germany, the desire to move was instilled in me at a young age. In any case, I've never been very enchanted with the United States and I've always enjoyed comparing the various ways groups of people organize themselves. It's sort of been my dream for a while now to become a nomadic freelance graphic designer. Like I said earlier, depending on where I go I may or not enjoy better internet, a generally more secular populous, better cell phone companies (they're absolutely horrible in the United States), healthier food, and possibly free healthcare.


There are lots of irritating bureaucracy that prevents you from doing what you want in the United States. For instance, in order to be allowed to purchase eyeglasses or contacts I must annually throw money down the drain so a doctor can tell me I have the same prescription for the fourth time in a row. Furthermore, being the graphic designer that I am, I'm less than excited over SOPA and what it could mean to the industry. I hate the food here, I went to Taiwan a while back and the food there was vastly better in addition to being cheaper. Cell companies here are absurd and everything is far away, our public transportation sucks and I rarely enjoy driving. Also, having free healthcare might mean that I'd have a easier time treating my Visual Snow. 


Europe would want to have me because I'd spend my money there, do services for people there and get along with others. If all I wanted to do was escape debt I'd runaway somewhere and become some kind of forest dweller.

- Russians are Russians.  'Nuff said.
- Ukraine and Belarus are mainly known for being bullied by Russia.
- Czechs and Slovaks are Slavic counterparts of the Austro-Hungarian empire, in that order, because that's pretty much all we know about them from the history lessons (that and Skoda, tourists and ice hockey).
- Slovenes are industrious and generally uninvolved, hence Switzerland.
- Poles are mainly known for kielbasa (sausages), beer, and Jews -- ergo, unfortunately, a WWII analogy.
- Croats have always held a certain likeness to Italians due to their maritime relations, Trieste, Dalmatians and all that.
- Montenegrins are seen as the current Slavic mafia thanks to their long-time prime minister Milo Djukanovic, who was under investigation for organized crime such as tobacco smuggling, racketeering and the like.  To Sicily with them!
- Serbs are in Bulgaria because Bulgaria has been seen, up until some 10-15 years ago, as a less developed country, but that no longer being the case, Serbs have apparently migrated to inhabit the now-vacated area of ""poorer eastern neighbors"" (becoming one themselves).
- Bulgarians are in Turkey because an average Serb's vision of a Bulgarian is that of a dark-haired, dark-eyed person with whom we used to be at war.  That's about as much as a Serb will deign to think about this beautiful country (which is a pity).
- sharing Turkey with Bulgarians are the Bosniaks since Serbs still define them predominantly through the eyeglasses of faith.
- Yugoslavs are ""up there"", a fictional nation only existing in polls and censuses, where no news comes to or from.
- Macedonians, I believe, require no explanation.

If you hit a track that's used by a lot of people who use the train for getting to/from work, especially between 7-8 and 17-19 oclock, you could encounter problems finding a seat in a train.

Worst: **Feigned tolerance**, rather than actually tolerating (or better, accepting) cultural differences the Dutch act butt-hurt pretty much the second someone shows himself to be a little different from what is considered ""normal"".

The other economic activity which Scotland is very disproportionately reliant on is the military, which obviously is majority funded south of the border.

I'm all for them having their independence if they want it, but it doesn't make good economic sense at the moment. In the boom years it would have been fine.

The other incredibly different aspect is actually deciding who is Scottish in the first place. Do you have to have been born in Scotland? What about children of Scots moved South? What about children of children? What about non Scot born who have been resident for years?

Firstly UK taxpayers guarentee an eye-wateringly large sum of toxic debt from Scottish companies ala RBS and Lloyds TSB Scotland Plc. If they get independence it would either cripple their economy completely or they would get to walk away scot free. Neither option is fair. 

Secondly Defence - The scots are a huge and important presence in the military of the UK. Have been since 1708 in 1714 and 1749 it was scottish troops who put down the Stuart uprising that began in Scotland. Our military ship-building more often than not takes place in Scotland. Scotland is the home of our nuclear deterrent. It would be tricky to work out those kind of details. 

Thirdly - Currency. If they scots kept the pound they would lose all countrol over their monetary soverignty, currently they are allowed to print their own bank notes. Obviously that would change. If they got their own currency without being tied to the world's fourth largest currency in terms of circulation it would be enourmously unstable, would devalue quickly and what's more because such a high proportion of scot's trade goes directly to england it would increase transaction costs as it would have to be changed repeatedly. 

Forthly - Scotland is a small country with rights to a large amount of natural resources. That would be like Florida declaring independance because it had access to the oil fields of America.

We wouldn't help bail out the dollar and we have been warning of failure since the 80s when it was first envisaged. We aren't part of the Eurozone. 

The thing is that no one has any idea what is going to happen. What kind of expert analysis would you like? Expert analysis from economists has a history of being wrong that is why only a few predicted the financial crash, the expert economists were also very keen to tell us, bar a few dissenting voices from guess where, how the euro would mean that Southern europeans would suddenly become as efficient as Northern ones. Considering that Italy was essentially a similar currency union before, can you tell me if that would work without huge subsidy moving from north to south? What empirical data would you like? Bond yields (7% is considered the level that a country can no longer really finance itself anymore) and debt-GDP ratios suggest that the only option would be default or for the countries in question to leave. Hence the ingredulity of The Telegraph's response that the ""end of the euro is a fantasy."" some fantasty for the german central bankers who decided to print marks again in order to prepare for the worst. 

I would love you to find me an article from an Italian perspective, in English, which tells us the plan to reduce bond yield below 7%, regain market confidence, and make Italy more efficient. So far the solution has been more debt, more integration, more austerity without control over one's own currency to support it and less democratic accountability.
