Maybe the French lifestyle is more suited to you than the American lifestyle. But you need to base you decision on decent reasoning, not Woody Allen movies. Amélie is a movie, too, you can't base you decision on that either.

People who have never felt deeply sad in their youth, people who have never made big choices in their lives, just wake up one day at 40 and ask themselves questions that you're asking yourself now.

Since you specifically mentioned ""socially conscious"" hip hop, you might check out the original soundtrack to La Haine -- I know it's more than a decade old now, but it's a great collection that includes a handful of artists already suggested here all with that specific theme.

I personally enjoy the group TTC, but perhaps the downvotes I'm getting suggest that their stuff isn't particularly socially conscious, which is probably true for the most part. (either that or people just don't like them? I'm not sure.) Though they frequently collaborate with a variety of other artists in the genre, such as the collective L'armée des 12, which is more socially conscious than their other material. They've even had a bit of crossover success with guest tracks from some experimental American artists that I'm fond of, like Busdriver and Doseone. I prefer their first album, Ceci n'est pas une disque, as their later stuff gets more ""club"" oriented.

The article suggests that the cause of the growth in obesity is a change in lifestyle - the abandon of fixed meals -  and insufficient physical activity.

We should blame education (parents unable to teach their kids how to eat properly and the school not doing it either), the lack of physical activity (in my opinion sport should not be seen only as a way to select future competitors) or the refusal to see sugar as it really is, an addictive, unhealthy substance.

**Ecopop, les intellecuels qui veulent freiner l’immigration**


par *Yelmarc Roulet*


 Qui est cette association alémanique qui préconise de limiter à 0,2% par an la croissance annuelle de la population? Portrait de groupe.


L’initiative fédérale d’Ecopop sera lancée officiellement vendredi. Son but: freiner la progression démographique. En Suisse d’abord, où elle veut limiter à 0,2% par an la croissance de la population par immigration. Mais aussi dans le monde: elle stipule que la Coopération au développement doit affecter 10% de son budget au contrôle des naissances dans le tiers monde.


Mais qui sont les initiants, qui se lancent avec fracas dans la polémique suscitée par la peur d’une Suisse à dix millions d’habitants? Malgré une histoire déjà longue, l’association Ecopop était jusqu’ici très peu connue, même en Suisse alémanique où elle recrute la quasi-totalité de ses membres.


Ecopop a vu le jour en 1971, sous le nom de Communauté de travail pour les questions de population. «C’était une époque de forte natalité», se souvient la Bernoise Anne-Marie Rey, l’une des fondatrices. L’époque aussi où le Club de Rome publiait son célèbre rapport «Halte à la croissance?» qui va inspirer un cercle fortement marqué par des personnalités du monde académique. Les économistes Hans Christoph Binswanger (Saint-Gall) et Theo Ginsburg (EPFZ) adhèrent, tout comme le biologiste Pierre André Tschumi (Berne). Ligne de pensée: la croissance économique, démographique et de la consommation représente une triple menace sur l’environnement qu’il faut combattre de manière groupée.


Ces années étaient aussi celles des initiatives xénophobes. «Nous ne les avons jamais soutenues, assure Anne-Marie Rey. Elles posaient mal le problème puisque c’est la croissance qui fait venir les gens», ajoute celle qui a aussi été députée socialiste bernoise et militante du droit à l’avortement. Entre les écologistes de la première heure et les émules de Schwarzenbach il y a pourtant des liens. Valentin Oehen, qui lancera en 1973 la seconde intiative contre la surpopulation, siégeait au comité. Le mouvement ne prendra jamais en Suisse romande.


Ecopop – l’association adopte ce nom en 1986 pour éviter la confusion avec les nationalistes – se tient à l’écart du combat politique et tend à devenir un club de vieux messieurs respectables ne prêchant plus guère qu’aux convertis. Quand il est sollicité il y a quatre ans pour en reprendre les rênes, Albert Fritschi, un économiste de l’EPFZ à la retraite, en avait à peine entendu parler. Il est aujourd’hui l’un des pères de l’initiative, avec Benno Büeler, un mathématicien-assureur représentant une relève quadragénaire du mouvement. C’est ce fils de paysan bâlois, formé dans le combat contre Kaiseraugst et végétarien qui est allé récemment défendre l’initiative sur le plateau d’Arena. «La Suisse risque de devenir une seule grande ville, sans nature et avec beaucoup de misère», a-t-il prophétisé.


Ecopop revendique plus de 800 membres, dont une bonne centaine ont été gagnés depuis l’annonce de l’initiative. Albert Fritschi fait état d’un budget de campagne immédiatement disponible d’environ 80 000 francs, d’une garantie de déficit de 30 000 francs couverte par des membres et d’arrières assurés. La Chancellerie fédérale l’a prévenu: «Une initiative bon marché coûte au moins 150 000 francs.» Pour financer ses actions, Ecopop puise aussi dans le legs que lui a laissé un couple de Hongrois, immigrés en 1956 et fervents partisans du planning familial.


Avec le lancement officiel de la récolte de signatures, qu’elle dit préparer depuis deux ans, Ecopop prend de vitesse les Démocrates suisses, qui ont annoncé de leur côté une «initiative pour stabiliser la population». «Les anciens de notre organisation seraient pour la croissance zéro, mais nous cherchons à réunir une majorité», explique Albert Fritschi pour justifier le 0,2% de croissance prévu par l’initiative.


La polémique immigration/croissance est devenue un thème majeur en vue des prochaines élections fédérales, mais aucun parti ne soutient l’initiative d’Ecopop. Des contacts personnels existent, surtout avec les écologistes. Walter Palmers, fondateur des Verts libéraux lucernois, en est membre. Les travaux d’Ecopop avaient inspiré les Verts Bastien Girod et Yvonne Gilli, premiers à ouvrir le débat dans leur parti. Quant à Andreas Thommen, qui a présidé les Verts argoviens, il est très actif dans le comité d’initiative.


Cela n’a pas l’heur de plaire au président du parti suisse, Ueli Leuenberger, qui sur son blog stigmatise la démarche d’un «Schwarzenbach vous salue bien». «Il est clair que nous nous opposons à cette initiative, précise-t-il. Elle ne dit pas comment limiter l’immigration et ne peut donc que pénaliser les plus faibles.»

Έλεγξα πρώτα τα links που δίνεις για να βεβαιωθώ αν πράγματι περιέχουν τις πληροφορίες που δίνεις. Όλες οι πληροφορίες (πάνω κάτω) είναι εκεί, εκτός από την πληροφορία του αριθμού των αστυνόμων που ψηφίζουν σε αυτά τα τμήματα. Αυτό που το βρήκες;

Ερχόμαστε τώρα στην ανάλυσή σου. Ας δούμε την πρώτη σειρά (polling station 806):

555 κάτοικοι, 755 ψήφοι, 200 αστυνόμοι, 117 ψήφοι στην ΧΑ, 22.2% ποσοστό της ΧΑ. Εδώ είτε πας να μας κοροϊδέψεις είτε δεν ξέρεις απλή αριθμητική. Γιατί 755/117 δίνει σαν αποτέλεσμα 15.5% και όχι 22.2%. Την ίδια αλχημεία κάνεις σε όλα τα υπόλοιπα τμήματα. 

Άρα όλη η ""ανάλυσή"" σου που ακολουθεί είναι τελείως λάθος. Ούτως ή άλλως ο αριθμός των ψήφων είναι άχρηστος: Αν (όπως παραδέχεσαι στην ""ανάλυσή"" σου) στο συγκεκριμένο τμήμα 26% είναι αστυνόμοι, και η ΧΑ έχει 22%, τότε αν 17% είναι ο μέσος όρος σε άλλα τμήματα,  x είναι το ποσοστό της ΧΑ στους αστυνόμους, ισχύει: 17 * 0.74+x * 0.26=22. Κάνοντας τις πράξεις, όπως σου έχει ήδη γράψει ο Naurgul, το αποτέλεσμα είναι ότι το x είναι περίπου 37%.

Let me explain. I'm by no means racist nor do I approve violence against women (or anyone).
Many sinti/roma claim for help only in the cold months of the year and roam around in the summer. When they leave the housing after the winter, they often take EVERYTHING out of the houses. Furniture, everything that can be moved, sometimes even the cables out of the wall - I have seen it. They just disappear overnight and with them the mentioned things. You have to renovate the house afterwards. I want to mention this might not apply to all of them, but it happens and it damages the facilities for those others who need help and would not destroy anything...

On violence to women, I believe it's an integration thing. But you can only integrate people who want to get integrated. Many, esp. from Turky don't seem want to be integrated. They build their turkish society, only meet other turkish emmigrants, talk turkish, live turkish life in germany. They can't speak proper german after 20 years of living there, because they life in a turkish society.
In those societies women often have to stay at home and do what their husband/father tells them to do. 
Also in these societies, when these women want to break out of it, the families tend to think their family honor has been damaged, and they even tend to kill these women. These are called honour murders and you read more than you might think in the newspaper.
So it's more a integration problem than a violence againt women problem. The violence problem is resulting from the integration problem, and I think by better integration, it could be solved.

but i think the 3rd paragraph is the reason they are evoking it in that it says you will not receive kindergeld if the nature of your job is in the form of a vocational training (ausbildung) which makes your contract befristet.

then they say your right is revoked because of [§ 62](http://dejure.org/gesetze/EStG/62.html) and i went through it and it seems that you are qualified. so i guess the problem, which is also stated in the 3rd paragraph, is that either they have mistaken your contract as one being in the nature of an ausbildung or that they didnt know or arent sure that it is unbefristet.

the other paper says you can challenge this decision. therefore instead of going to the lawyer and giving them money it could be a case of misunderstanding which does happen in bureaucracy, esp if there is a change in law or when documents arent updated. so what i would do is perhaps write a letter and provide prove that you are not in an ausbildung and that your contract is unbefristet. you can even visit their office to talk to the person who issued the letter and clear things up. if you have the right to receive the money you will, in germany law is upheld even if the people doing it may not always be pleasant. good luck!",0,1351969757,null,0,false,0,c6vvpvj,t3_12kbbg,t1_c6vvpvj,t3_12kbbg,null,1430310774,5,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,5

1) Regarding the number of policemen voting in the 11 polling stations the journalist examined (806 to 816).

The Ministry of Interior published the list of all polling stations before the elections. In this list, there is a column with the number of registered voters for each polling station. You can find the complete list [here](http://www.ypes.gr/UserFiles/f0ff9297-f516-40ff-a70e-eca84e2ec9b9/TMHMATA_INTERNET_20120427_1213.xls) (xls).

For your convenience, these are the 11 stations.

http://i.imgur.com/PqHoE.png

The number of registered voters is found in the fourth column (""πλήθος εκλογέων καταλόγου""), including the negligible number of people that normally vote in other local authorities (""ετεροδημότες""), but would exercise their rights in these 11.

You can see that for polling station No. 806 there are 555 registered voters.

Now, let's see if we can find the number of policemen voting in that station. Go to http://ekloges.ypes.gr/ and choose the second option for previous election results. Now choose May 2012. Then click on the ""stations"" link, found right on the menu bar. Choose the 1st Athens District (""A' Αθηνών"") and input ""806"" (without the quotes) for the polling station.

You should end up with this:

http://i.imgur.com/8mfd1.png

You see ""755"" as the total number of registered voters in this polling station. They give this number because they are printing the final results, including all voters.

Remember the 555 registered voters we've seen above, which is the number given by the Ministry of Interior for citizens? Subtracting 555 from 755 gives us 200, which is the number of policemen voting in polling station No. 806. This means that 26,49% of the voters in No. 806 were policemen.

What the journalist wrote:

http://www.tovima.gr/afieromata/elections2012/article/?aid=457088

&gt; σε κάθε ένα από αυτά τα τμήματα, όπως προκύπτει εξάλλου και από τους εκλογικούς καταλόγους, ψηφίζουν περίπου 550-700 άτομα κι ο αριθμός των αστυνομικών που ψηφίζουν σ΄αυτά κυμαίνεται από 20% ως 30% επί του συνόλου των ψηφισάντων

He wrote that 550 to 700 people vote in these 11 stations, and policemen constitute 20% to 30% of the total number of voters. The real numbers for No. 806 are 755 and 26,49%. He rounds a lot, I quoted the exact numbers from the official data/results.

2) Regarding the numbers stated in my results.

As you saw for yourself, GD's percentage in the aforementioned polling station is 22,20%. This is the official, final result printed by the Ministry. It's not a number someone made up.

3) Regarding the necessity for the number of votes.

The number of votes matters, because we don't know the exact number of absentees and their affiliation (citizens or policemen). In my previous comment, I also examined a scenario in which all absentees are citizens.

Let me write a bit about it again.

Among the 11 stations used by the journalist, the polling station with the highest GD percentage, according to the official results, is No. 811. GD gets 23,08% there. You can see it for yourself using the procedure I've described above.

We know that's the final number (citizens and policemen). From the Ministry of Interior list I've linked to above, we see that there are 566 registered voters in this polling station.

From the official results, we see that 559 people voted there, while there were 763 registered voters (the total number includes policemen). That means there were 204 absentees. In the extreme scenario, where I'm trying to maximise GD's percentage among policemen, following your reading of the article and the journalist's claims, all absentees were citizens. Subtracting 204 from 559 gives us 355.

We're left with 355 citizen voters (559 registered minus 204 absentees) and 197 policemen voters (764 total number of registered minus 566 registered in the electoral roll).

Now, we know that the journalist mentions other polling stations nearby, ""where policemen do not vote"". These 7 stations, 856 to 862, are to be found in Tsocha st. Here they are:

http://i.imgur.com/CTlrO.png

These are GD's percentages there:

856: 15,33 (second party)

857: 15,15 (second party)

858: 18,55 (second party)

859: 19,07 (second party)

860: 20,72 (first party)

861: 20,82 (second party)

862: 20,62 (first party)

AVERAGE: 18,61%

(I've shown you how to find these numbers on ekloges.ypes.gr.)

Pretty high, without any policemen. 1 in 5 citizens voted GD.

It's not a far-fetched scenario to say that other voters, a couple of minutes down the road, followed the same pattern. Therefore let's say that 18,61% of the 355 citizen voters of polling station No. 811 above, voted for GD. This means GD took 66 votes from citizens.

We see from the official results that GD took 126 votes there. If 66 of them came from citizens, then the rest came from policemen. That is 60 votes. Knowing that 197 policemen voted there, gives us 30,46% (missed 1 vote in my previous note, pressed 6 instead of nearby 7, that's why it was off by 0,5%). So that's 3 out of 10 policemen, and doing the same procedure for No. 812 (lowest GD percentage among the 11 stations the journalist examines), gives us 2 out of 10.

(Remember, we examined this by giving all absentees to citizens, while GD's percentage among citizens could have been higher, seeing the pattern above.)

Even in this scenario, we're in the ""1 in 4 policemen"" range (20-30%), for this specific neighbourhood. As said above, still a far cry from ""1 in 2"".

In conclusion, I'm over here if you feel the need to say that you're sorry. You could have checked the numbers for yourself in the official results. As for shame, I know a journalist that should be ashamed. Follow his case and you'll see why. Check the blog post and the Indymedia links above.

Personally, I disagree, but that's not the point.  The point is, that there is currently no legal way to filter the internet and keep ideas from spreading simply by suppressing their distribution. Compare this to the ""hate speech"" laws, were spreading the ideas may be illegal, but is still possible and can only be stopped by elaborate legal actions.  See how there is a difference?

I'm not Lokarn, and as I said I'm not even big on monarchy myself, but overall, and from the people I have talked with, the reasons are among the following, and are not even particularly original

- Traditionalism of most sorts generally makes monarchy a nice addition, i.e. for people who are conservative it rings a bell.
- Even for the rest of the population and among left-wing persons a monarchy is associated with ""the Golden Age"", i.e. there is a feeling that ""greatness"" was associated with having a King (could be a bit of a cargo-cult deal)
- The Republic was mostly an urban affair, the rest of the population was never overly attached to it; even if the republicans were the ""ardent patriots"" of their time some also associate the first republic with an extremely unstable period that didn't even provide the expected benefits.
- ""Grass is greener"" sort f thing, you see Spaniards complaining about their Monarchy, here people complain about the Republic, each sees the theoretical ""advantages"" of the opposite system.

Overall though I would say that the biggest factor is the weight of history... most people associate the Republic with a specific time-frame, while the monarchy is assumed to be everything else. And even if the overwhelming majority of Portuguese live better today than in the XVI century, the royal symbols have a certain attraction since they convey apparent grandeur in this times of decrepitude.",0,1351984064,null,0,false,0,c6vyxyk,t3_12kpaf,t1_c6vyxyk,t1_c6vxql6,null,1430312359,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

No, but I was guessing it wouldn't have been constructive to describe the incident as a *verdachtsunabhängige Personenkontrolle*. At least at the time, Bavarian police actually didn't need to state any reason to ID or even search you under certain conditions (near the border, on airports, railway stations, ""Durchfahrtsstraßen*) but that hadn't been the case.

&gt;  This doesn't mean you need a passport or ID card, it can also mean you can call someone who vouches for you etc.

Which is essentially what I said. You don't have to carry ID, but it will take time for them to verify your identity if you don't. They'll drive you to pick up your ID card or take you to the police station for an *Identitätsfeststellung* if necessary.

&gt; In general, pissing off the police here will cost you time with little gain.

I was aware of that, but I knew it would be ""safe"" for everybody in the car and pissing them off was my intention at that age. So, refusing to show them my ID card was a political statement that seemed worth it at the time.

This would give you 18 months to find employment after graduation, with the restriction that the degree you got has to be relevant for the job. Applying from outside would be more difficult, depending on the profession you choose. If you decide to become a bio-engineer and have good grades on top of that, it wouldn't be that hard, but with English literature it would be an entirely different matter.

Whether you'd meet the admission requirements depends on your high school degree and SAT, with lower requirements after a year of college. If you do your bachelor's in the US and come for your master's, that would work as well. Non-college activities may help with your application, but don't carry as much weight in Germany as they seem to in the US.

As for jobs, anything engineering or sciences would be good (not sure about vanilla biology, though), but keep in mind you'd have to do it for a long time.

Beobachte das mal: Wann immer jemand sagt „Wir Frauen/Männer sind“ oder „Ihr Männer/Frauen seid“, dann tut er das so gut wie immer, um irgendwelche eigentlich unakzeptablen Eigenschaften oder Handlungen qua Geschlecht zu rechtfertigen, oder sich sonstwie selbst zu beweihräuchern.

Here are the stats: 

53, 371 class C members 

6, 319 class B members 

3,000 class A members. 

This is less than 5% class A members. 

Class C members received 26% of the total in royalties, 

class B got a mere 6%

Class A received… 68%

The system is inherently and grossly unfair.  The artists have almost no choice but to use this complex shitty system. What the GEMA are about to do to the clubs in Germany is so utterly wrong,  its criminal. GEMA are a monopolist and are acting like the worst kind of monopolist. 

If the money paid for the records played on youtube and in clubs was accurately distributed I would have less of an issue with their behaviour but it isnt,  the vast majority of the money goes to people who made no effort to publish a work, that is scandalous.

Untill 1862 the U.S. didn't even have a uniform national currency. Mark Twain reported that 
""The firm paid my wages in wildcat money at its face value"".     
    
If the United States took 70 years to sort out a federal banking legislation, and over 100 years to create their current Federal Reserve just before WWI, I think we should accept that Europe will also take its time to climb this learning curve, and there's no need for some U.S. commentators to be all sanctimonious about their system. Europe is trying to do in twenty years where the States took 100, and we have even stronger national traditions that have to be taken into account.

I will be honest, I am no too concerned with the youtube thing, that is easily overcome. I am fucking furious about what they plan to do to the electronic subculture in Germany, a lot of my friends make electronic music, run clubs and DJ, it isn't something many are making huge profits on. It should be cherished, unfortunately it is being taxed heavily and unfairly, to the point where clubs will go out of business. Clubs and electronic music might not be your bag but German electronic music touches many millions of people around the world and encourages many more musicians in their endeavours. It is a cultural asset that should be cherished, it is such a positive side to Germany, it is such a shame that it is being attacked, especially when so much music that is played is private and not even registered with GEMA.

Other immigrants can integrate well - tell my why some other communities often don't integrate, please. Although there might be things to improve on the german side of immigration (there is always potential to improve), tell me why it's esp. these people where integration fails more often than integration of other immigrants?

It seems you do not understand what I wanted to say. When people do not want to be integrated but exploit the system, you can't help them, you can't force them. I'm sure it's only a smaller part of these people who do and think so, but these damage the system, facilites and reputation for all of them.

true,IvanTheNth,null,null,"Ok, το άλλο μου ποστ το έγραψα αργά το βράδυ. Σήμερα έριξα μια ματιά στα στοιχεία που δίνεις. As it turns out they put the final nail on your coffin's argument.

Το πρόβλημα με τα δεδομένα σου, είναι ότι όλα τα τμήματα τα οποία μέχρι στιγμής βλέπεις είναι τμήματα που ψηφίζει η αστυνομία. Στο 856 στο excel έχει 534 εγγεγραμμένους ενώ στο site των εκλογών 685. Στο 857 στο excel 538 στο site 720. Στο 858, 529 στο excel και 720 στο site. Στο 859, 546 στο excel, ενώ 788 στο site. Στο 860 541 στο excel και 820 στο site. Στο 861, 529 στο excel ενώ 770 στο site. Τέλος στο 862 έχει 532 εγγεγραμμένους στο excel και 772 στο site των εκλογών. Αυτός είναι και ο λόγος που η ΧΑ έχει τόσο μεγάλα ποσοστά.

Στα γειτονικά τμήματα: Στο 802 (μπορείς να ελέγξεις ότι στο excel και στο site έχει τον ίδιο αριθμό των εγγεγραμμένων 525) η ΧΑ έχει μόλις 5.83%, στο 803 8.42%, στο 804 5.84%, στο 805 9.3%. Στο 819 6.4% (πρόσεξε ότι στο ίδιο ακριβώς σχολείο, στα διπλανά τμήματα 817 και 818 που από το excel προκύπτει ότι ψηφίζουν αστυνόμοι η ΧΑ έχει 17% και 23%). Στο 820 η ΧΑ είναι στο 7.5%.  Δυο δρόμους παραπέρα από το 857 και τα λοιπά που δίνεις, στο 863 (που πάλι σύμφωνα με το excel σου δεν ψηφίζουν αστυνόμοι) η ΧΑ παίρνει 4.44%, στο 864 η ΧΑ έχει 7.5%. Φυσικά μπορώ να συνεχίσω. Αν δε πιστεύεις ότι τα τμήματα συγγενεύουν, μπορείς να το ελέγξεις μέσω του [site](http://www.ypes.gr/services/tmimata_2012/tmimata.htm) που έδωσες.

Για να τελειώνουμε μια και καλή. Θα κάνω τις εξής υποθέσεις. Η ΧΑ έχει 18% εκεί που ψηφίζουν αστυνόμοι (αυτό είναι μικρό σε σχέση με τα στοιχεία). 10% εκεί που δεν ψηφίζουν (αυτό είναι υπερβολικό όπως φαίνεται από τα στοιχεία που δίνω) και το 25% στα τμήματα που ψηφίζουν αστυνόμοι, είναι αστυνόμοι. Τότε με μια απλή εξίσωση πρώτου βαθμού βγάζεις ότι το 42% των αστυνόμων ψήφισε ΧΑ. Φυσικά εγώ πήρα χοντρικά τους αριθμούς. Αν θες, μπορείς να πάρεις ακριβώς, αν έχεις χρόνο. Δυστυχώς, το αποτέλεσμα υποθέτω θα είναι χειρότερο για σένα. 

Και κάτι τελευταίο. Όσο περισσότεροι αστυνόμοι υποθέτεις ότι ψηφίζουν σε αυτά τα τμήματα τόσο μικρότερο βγαίνει το ποσοστό της ΧΑ ανάμεσά τους, και όχι το αντίστροφο όπως γράφεις στο ποστ σου.",0,1352027870,null,0,1352028180,0,c6w6d80,t3_11gsg1,t1_c6w6d80,t1_c6vxtvv,null,1430315935,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; Το πρόβλημα με τα δεδομένα σου

Remember, I followed Naurgul's reading. In this scenario, the journalist says that Nos. 806 to 816 are the 11 polling stations where citizens and policemen vote (""σ' αυτά ψηφίζουν - με βάση ειδικούς εκλογικούς καταλόγους- χιλιάδες αστυνομικοί"", 20% to 30% according to the journalist, 25,82% to 27,42% according to the official data), and 856 to 862 are the nearby polling stations where only citizens vote (""σε εκλογικά τμήματα της οδού Τσόχα, όπου *δεν* ψηφίζουν οι αστυνομικοί""). The journalist also says that in Tsocha st.'s  7 stations GD took 12-14%, although we can see from the official results that GD took 15,15% to 20,82% (average 18,61%).

Having these in mind, let's move on.

&gt; όλα τα τμήματα τα οποία μέχρι στιγμής βλέπεις είναι τμήματα που ψηφίζει η αστυνομία

This was one of the points we've debated with Naurgul (where policemen vote and how Lambropoulos got his data, Naurgul said journalists know better). I've seen the extra number of voters for stations 856 to 862. After all, I'm the one that linked to the spreadsheet. :)

The problem is that the journalist said there are no policemen voters in Nos. 856 to 862. If we still follow Lambropoulos' scenario, those extra voters cannot be policemen. Then what are they? Military personnel, firemen, others? We don't know. These categories are also included in special lists. If you say that they are policemen (which is *not* what Lambropoulos wrote), then GD's percentage is roughly doubled. However, we cannot add percentages from different categories.

Have you heard about something called Reddiquette?

&gt;Food security is part of multifunctionality you dolt. 

I never said that it wasn't. It is just that if we focus on avoding starvation, we should focus on growing calorie rich food, in the most advantegous areas. That means, that we should not grow (a lot) in arid areas, we should not support wine at all (since wine is not a necessity for survival), in fact, it would probably be wiser to tear down those wine yards and plant potoes/onions or something similar. We should also not support beef to the way that we are doing, and above all, we should focus on being effective + 100 more things that would be necessary. None of that is happening right now, so basically we can remove the argument that we are doing this to avoid starvation


&gt;you never explain why the 2% goes to supporting vinyards (environmental sustainability mostly, by the way, but I guess that kind of shoots down your ridiculous argument)

Well, I do not know *why* the EU parlament chooses to support wine with over 2 % of the budget. It is a mystery to me why they do it. How should I know, I think it is the most financially stupid thing in the world. The only reason I can come up with is that they are corrupt, since there I can't see a financially sound person defending this. [Here](http://euobserver.com/economic/21605) is an article on how much it costs the EU consumer each day. Even if the numbers are exagerrated (not that I see why they should be) it is to much, way to much. So I have no idea why the EP is hurting Europan consumers in this way.

And, no, I have never ever read anything about it going to eco wines. I originally found the number in an Eurostatreport, which is [here](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-10-044/EN/KS-SF-10-044-EN.PDF). Look at table 3, the numbers for wine. [here](http://www.just-drinks.com/analysis/just-the-facts-wine-subsidies-in-the-eu_id105207.aspx) is an article referring to it as well. So you have any support for your claim that the 2 % of the EU budget that is going to wine, is going to eco wine? I don't believe that, but I'd love to be wrong.

Other critiscism I have against that CAP is that one of the arguments for its existance is that is to support smaller farms. In fact, the CAP hurts small farming, since it focuses on output, so economies of scale are rewarded.

Another critiscism is that the CAP support oversupply. Every years, million tonnes of whatever is purchased byt the EU to a guaranteed price- no effective market. Parts of it is then exported with subsidies which is one of the many ways that the EU harms 3rd world farmers, who don't get these subsidies. 

And don't get me started about the cotton subsidies......

&gt;and you never once propose any kind of reasonable way of getting out of it (because there isn't one, the CAP is unfortunately necessary at the moment - the CFP on the other hand...)

You never asked, yet you blame me for not answering the questions that were in your head. I am not a medium, nor do I believe in mediums. You just said multifunctionality, and I was suppose to read your whole last comment into that?  My suggestion to get rid of the CAP is to move it to the countries. Then France can keep up there ridiculous spending all they want and sponsor my food btw. I trust my government to have more balls to stand up to the lobbying, and I trust my government to be less corrupt as well. I also have more influence over my government and they seem to be more in tuned with science and finances to tell you the truth


So, you are defending the CAP, the 44 % and the wine subsidies.Do you think it is finacially sound, or do you thing it doesn't have to be sound since it is the CAP? Is my other critiscism against the CAP unfounded? If it is not, what do you plan to do about it? The recent/latest proposal doesn't really deal with most of my critisism, so do you think it is OK to wait to 2020 to even start?

EU agricultural production is, more or less, spot on with consumption. If the rest of the world were to disappear, we'd be able to have pretty much the same food we do now.

&gt;Other critiscism I have against that CAP is that one of the arguments for its existance is that is to support smaller farms. In fact, the CAP hurts small farming, since it focuses on output, so economies of scale are rewarded.

Incorrect. [The EU makes direct payments to farmers based on their land, not on their output. Economies of scale don't play into it.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Payment_Scheme)

&gt;Another critiscism is that the CAP support oversupply. Every years, million tonnes of whatever is purchased byt the EU to a guaranteed price- no effective market. Parts of it is then exported with subsidies which is one of the many ways that the EU harms 3rd world farmers, who don't get these subsidies.

Incorrect. The years of those surpluses have been gone for a while now, thanks to the decoupling of subsidies and production. Furthermore, the EU has made a commitment to remove export subsidies by 2013 (and indeed, today it's only 350 million euros where not so long ago it was in the multiple billion euro area).

&gt;And don't get me started about the cotton subsidies......

Pretty much gone, as per requirements of the Agreement on Agriculture of the WTO. Seriously, how fucking old is your information? 1993 or something?

&gt;So you have any support for your claim that the 2 % of the EU budget that is going to wine, is going to eco wine?

I didn't say it was going to eco wine, I said it was there to promote environmental sustainability (such as water management and so on). A significant portion of the CAP money goes towards this, it's not tied to production in any way, and it's available to most agricultural producers in the EU.

Listen, I'm from Australia. We hate the CAP because it fucks with our exports. I moved to the EU a few years back, studied and wrote a masters thesis about the CAP. I went into it expecting to come out with justification for its removal, and instead I found that it was actually the least-bad outcome in terms of managing agricultural policy if it were to be on an EU or national level.

No reason to support wine then, is it? No reason to support growing in arid areas.Sothern Spain and Greece, no more subsidies.Also, to avoid starvation, maybe we should change how we consume stuff.

So, do you think it is fair that 2 % of the EU budget goes to wine? Why should it goes to wine at all? Why can't they change their watering system on their own? I have a *long* list of other industries, far more important than wine, that would love to have 2 % of the EU budget. 

Second, I noticed that  you didn't address the fact that the subsidies leads to rising food prices. How can that be justified? Why should I pay more for my food (twice, since I first pay their salary), particularely now. Also, that keeps the 3rd world farmers out of our market. 

&gt; I found that it was actually the least-bad outcome in terms of managing agricultural policy if it were to be on an EU or national level. I don't like it, but I understand the justification for it being there and why it is actually necessary.

Why is it necessary then, particularely to the levels that they have? You are not addressing the corruption then. The EU budget hasn't been OK for 17 (!!!) years, and the CAP is a huge part of that, obviusly since it is a huge part of the budget (I am not saying that farmers are more evil than the rest of us). Second, being Swedish I actually think our farmers were more adjusted to the world market before we entered the EU, and we did not pay more subsidies. So, why not bring it down on a national level?Then the French can support their wine all they want, and I don't have to. 

Also, how it is smart to skew healthy competition? 

Edit: Another argument for bringing it down on a national level is that Sweden don't really need as much water management as some other countries. We have other problems to face, for example to much water in the future. Would be much better if we could pay for that, instead of how the French can water their wine yards.

That's what I'm saying, it's not production subsidies, it's environmental sustainability payments. Things like ensuring water doesn't leak in irrigation and cause water stress on the surrounding area thanks to this inefficiency of water usage. It can still be economically sustainable to have leaky irrigation and farm off of that, but it doesn't mean that it's best for the surrounding country side.

&gt;Second, I noticed that you didn't address the fact that the subsidies leads to rising food prices. How can that be justified? Why should I pay more for my food (twice, since I first pay their salary), particularely now. Also, that keeps the 3rd world farmers out of our market.

It's justified because stability in food prices is more important. You only have to look at some bad harvest years (such as 2008) to see the problems that happen. That's why food security is important, if basic stable produce rises significantly in price, it can cause serious stress on poorer families in even rich countries like Sweden and the UK. [Wheat rose by 120% percent in price on world markets in 2008, prompting rioting and looting in a number of cities and towns across the globe.](http://articles.cnn.com/2008-04-14/world/world.food.crisis_1_food-aid-food-prices-rice-prices?_s=PM:WORLD) The whole point is to ensure price stability over a long period, not best prices now.

&gt;Why is it necessary then, particularely to the levels that they have?

Για την ουσία, δε λες και πάλι τίποτα.

Ξέρω ποιος είναι ο Λαμπρόπουλος. Αφού αναφέρεις το indymedia θα σου πρότεινα να ρίξεις μια ματιά εκεί, στο υλικό που έχει  γραφτεί πολύ πριν από τις εκλογές για τις σχέσεις αστυνομίας και της ακροδεξιάς. Η Ελευθεροτυπία είχε επίσης γράψει άρθρα επί του θέματος (πχ [1](http://iospress.gr/texts_2011/20110701.htm),  [2](http://iospress.gr/ios2008/ios20080323.htm)). Το αποτέλεσμα που ξαφνιάζει τον Λαμπρόπουλο (και εσένα ίσως περισσότερο από τον Λαμπρόπουλο) είναι κάτι που κάποιοι που ξέραν λίγη ιστορία θα θεωρούσαν δεδομένο. Απλώς το θέμα είναι ότι εσύ ήθελες να αποδείξεις ότι ""1 στους 2 αστυνόμους ψήφισε ΧΑ"" δεν ισχύει και όχι οτι ο Λαμπρόπουλος έγραψε ένα ποσοστό λάθος. Άρα το θέμα δεν είναι εξαρχής το τί λέει ο Λαμπρόπουλος. Το χρησιμοποιείς ως strawman, αποφεύγοντας το θέμα των ψήφων των αστυνομικών.

&gt;Should I say ""apology accepted"" for this then, where I pasted the number from the official results but you forgot to include absentees? :)

Όχι. Ό,τι έγραψα σε εκείνο το ποστ συνεχίζει να είναι αλήθεια. Δηλαδή ότι αλλάζεις σαν τα πουκάμισα απόψεις. Από το οι αστυνόμοι ψηφίζουν αριστερά, πήγες στο 1 στους 10 αστυνόμους ρίχνει ΧΑ, μετά 1 στους 6 μετά 1 στους 4. 

Απλώς εκείνο το ποστ δεν έχει πια νόημα, γιατί βρήκες εσύ άμεσα τα στοιχεία που δείχνουν που ψηφίζουν οι αστυνόμοι. Έκατσα με τον Naurgul, και ελέγξαμε περίπου 50 τμήματα γύρω από την ΓΑΔΑ, κάποια με αυξημένο αριθμό ψηφοφόρων και κάποια χωρίς. Τα στοιχεία που βγάλαμε και θα ανεβάσουμε στο r/europe για να διαλύσουμε κάθε αμφιβολία που εσύ και κάποιοι άλλοι δημιούργησαν, είναι ότι περίπου 45% των αστυνόμων έριξε ΧΑ.

Αυτή η συζήτηση δεν έχει πια νόημα. Αν σου αρέσει να έχεις τον τελευταίο λόγο μπορείς να απαντήσεις. Απλώς ελπίζω με όλα αυτά που βρήκες να αντιλήφθηκες ότι πράγματι η αστυνομία ψηφίζει ΧΑ.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;That's what I'm saying, it's not production subsidies, it's environmental sustainability payments. Things like ensuring water doesn't leak in irrigation and cause water stress on the surrounding area thanks to this inefficiency of water usage. It can still be economically sustainable to have leaky irrigation and farm off of that, but it doesn't mean that it's best for the surrounding country side.

You still haven't given me a source for that is how the wine money is spent. Give me a source please. I'd since that would be very relevant since you are saying that 2% of the EU budget is going to environmental adjustement of wine yards.

&gt;It's justified because stability in food prices is more important. You only have to look at some bad harvest years (such as 2008) to see the problems that happen. That's why food security is important, if basic stable produce rises significantly in price, it can cause serious stress on poorer families in even rich countries like Sweden and the UK. Wheat rose by 120% percent in price on world markets in 2008, prompting rioting and looting in a number of cities and towns across the globe. The whole point is to ensure price stability over a long period, not best prices now.


It is not justified to the level that we are subsidising, and it is not an argument that it can't be done on a national level. Are you claiming that we need to subsidise it with €3/day to stabilise them? I do not think we need to pay that amount of money


&gt;I'm sorry, what do you object to? You still haven't demonstrated that you have any knowledge of how the CAP money is spent and on what.

I sent you the Eurostat report. I object to around 40 % of the EU budget is going to CAP. I think it could be done better on a national level, and less corrupt. Also, I do not think the farmers need that much.

Also, you haven't addressed the fact that the EU is harming 3rd world farmers with it subsidies.

&gt;Source?

Of course. [Link](http://www.businessinsider.com/auditors-warn-of-corruption-in-eu-spending-for-the-16th-year-in-a-row-2010-11). Another [Link](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7092102.stm). They mention the corruption that you do not believe exist either, but really, I can just throw link after link at you about the corruption in the EU. Here are some:

[Link](http://euobserver.com/news/30011). Here is my favourite, a minister's daughter, a Swedish accordian club etc. This is when investigating journalism actually checked where the money was going........

[Link 1](http://socialwarriors.co.uk/2012/05/wealthy-minister-earns-2m-in-eu-farm-subsidies-which-his-department-tried-to-cover-up/).

[Link 2](http://euobserver.com/economic/116573) - here it is also mentioned that some countries (willfully I suppose because it is not really hard) don't release the numbers in accessible ways. 

[Link 3](http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/07/03/224233.html). This is actually an article of EU dealing with it, but the numbers they get back are very small, I just thought I wanted to prove that it was officially recognised byt the EU that it is corruption, since you do seem to believe that. 


So, how do you suggest dealing with the corruption? Do you think it is wise keeping something that is obvious corrupt? It haven't been dealt with in the last 16 years, so it is not like one can say that the EU is working on it - then it wouldn't exist. I also believe government Reinfeldt (or Löfvén) for that matter and our agricultural minister Eskil Erlandsson is less corrupt than than the French one (who seems to be running the show), and the EU as a whole. That means that more of my money would actually go where they are supposed to go. I can support that too (since I know that you will ask for a source). Transparency Internationals report about corriuption in Europe [Link](http://issuu.com/transparencyinternational/docs/corruption_risks_in_europe?mode=window&amp;backgroundColor=%23222222). There is also the complete Transparency International Report - [Link](http://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/pub/corruption_perceptions_index_2011) about the corruption index of the world. Unfortunately EU is not on that, but you can see France, Spain, Greece, Italy for example is not that high. 

Why should I pay to French wine firms - twice?


&gt;Do you know anything about how much Swedish farmers get in subsidies, and how those are composed?

Yes and no, my family has a (super small) farm, that we rent out to my cousine (or, they take care of it for free in an effort to keep the land open, that is a huge problem in Sweden, that you might be aware of, the subsidies aren't really reflecting that).  Do you know how the Swedish farming was in 1994? It has changed *a lot* since the entering of the EU. If you ask me if I have a great knowledge of them - no. Hardly my cousins husband has it, and he runs the farm, is highly intelligent and an all around a good farmer. He says it is a complete jungle, they have LRF courses on it. Even if one knows it is hard to say it is sustainable and good on an EU level. Also, he says the absolute majority of the money goes to a few huge farmers, which seems to be in accordance with [this](http://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/pub/corruption_perceptions_index_2011) article from the Guardian. 

For example, since northern Europe will be getting more and more rain (I study environmental science) it is strange that 2 % of the whole EU budget should go to how to deal with arid areas in wine yards (which you claim), but not a lot on how to deal with the more rains we will get.

Why shouldn't this be dealt with on a national level, do you really think it is normal that 40 % of the budget goes to CAP, that we skew competition, not deal with the corruption, harm 3rd world countries and have such a large part of the budget aimed towards a few countries?

""555 κάτοικοι, 755 ψήφοι, 200 αστυνόμοι, 117 ψήφοι στην ΧΑ, 22.2% ποσοστό της ΧΑ. Εδώ είτε πας να μας κοροϊδέψεις είτε δεν ξέρεις απλή αριθμητική. Γιατί 755/117 δίνει σαν αποτέλεσμα 15.5% και όχι 22.2%. Την ίδια αλχημεία κάνεις σε όλα τα υπόλοιπα τμήματα.""

So, everything you wrote in this comment is still true? And you claim forgery, although 22,2% and the rest of GD percentages came from the official results?

Well, that is something. These data were available for a number of comments now, because I've been the one linking to them. I was also the one linking to the government newspaper and other official data. I've wrote about the problems with the number of extra voters (not knowing who they are and how many of them were absentees).

&gt; Τα στοιχεία που βγάλαμε και θα ανεβάσουμε στο r/europe για να διαλύσουμε κάθε αμφιβολία που εσύ και κάποιοι άλλοι δημιούργησαν, είναι ότι περίπου 45% των αστυνόμων έριξε ΧΑ.

Good for you, waiting to read and critique your analysis.

&gt; Αυτή η συζήτηση δεν έχει πια νόημα.

Indeed, but not because there are some imaginary points to be accumulated in having the last word. It's sad that you didn't even appreciate politeness in response to your rude comments (in Greek, although you know most people can't read them), and you insist that everything you write is true (it is not, according to the official results).

If you want to claim that 50% of the police forces in Greece voted for Golden Dawn, based on incomplete data on an altered scenario that concerns a neighbourhood in an Athens district, then you are free to do so. I beg to differ, because then we would have to make similar projections for other cases too. If, for example, SYRIZA was the party with the most votes in some polling stations in Exarchia (actually, it was), and knowing that most terrorists (with or without quotes) live or have links to this neighbourhood, let's take a similar leap and attribute most terrorists to SYRIZA. Don't you see how absurd this is?

I've made it perfectly clear from the beginning: yes, GD's percentage among policemen was probably bigger than the one found in the general population. However, the ""1 in 2"" scenario is extreme.

EDIT (for future readers): extensive analysis below, it is projected that 1 in 5 did it nationally, Athens' centre results were skewed towards Golden Dawn.

Yup. However, there is also more than meets the eye.

&gt; Would it not be cheaper for the university to hire its own cleaning staff??

The university *cannot* hire. Never could. The most it can do is to use contractors (not *hire* contractors, just enter a fixed-length contract with them). All it can do is plead to the Ministry of Education to create new job positions with specific criteria, which the ministry isn't too keen to do; even if the job positions are created, they need to be filled via entrants into the country-wide government job placement program - it's more or less impossible to directly hire someone (and I think in general that's a good thing, before this nepotism and favor-dealing was rampant).

(cont).

Edit: also, it has been made clear to me that there is an understanding between the Administration of the University and the contractors for cleanup/security, where the second will hire some specific people that will serve not in cleanup/security but in the administration; usually secretaries or equivalent personnel.

&gt; What are your stereotype about Chinese people?

Hardworking, mostly. You will encounter some racism, sure, specially because in a time of crisis uneducated people tend to find a scapegoat on immigrants (and middle-aged and older people tend to be uneducated because of the time they grew in). As others have said, this racism is sometimes motivated because Chinese immigration is usually more eager to accept job offers with illegally low wages and long working hours than locals, which breaks these local workers' already debilitated bargaining power. Still, specially among young people, you will find almost no prejudice or hostility whatsoever.

&gt; What's the percentage of you can speak English?

Again, for the same reasons, middle-aged and older people are much less likely to speak or understand anything in English. Most young people have been through mandatory education which included several years of English, so they will be able to at least communicate in the language to some basic extent. Among university students the people with high level English raises dramatically, specially those who have been a part of international exchange programs like Erasmus (which are a lot).

&gt; How much do you really like Chinese culture and would you willing to let your kids to learn mandarin if you have the chance?

I like oriental cultures in general, probably because I grew up watching Japanese animation, so I tend to find the traditional imagery of different oriental cultures (mainly Japanese, Chinese and Korean) attractive. But further than that and some good real Chinese meals made by some friends of mine I've barely had any contact with it. I love learning languages, however, and even though Mandarin isn't currently in my list of priorities I would totally encourage my (hypothetical) children to learn it if they have an interest on it.
