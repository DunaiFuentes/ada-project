The way I did it was to enroll in a degree at my local university, and then just visited a german university (TUM) and took on a couple of units.

As there are quite a few internationals at TUM, everyone at the Uni speaks a nice clean ""hoch-deutsch"" and also have a decent grasp of English, which made life a lot easier than trying to understand the local dialect. Getting up to speed with the technical german language takes a fair while too, try reading some technical papers written in german beforehand or you'll probably struggle when you get there.

Also, find yourself an english speaking roommate - otherwise you will go insane having to speak german all the time at home.

Definitely one of the best decisions I ever made, I went on to do further studies at UniBW and got to work with the German space agency (DLR) and on the DARPA Urban Challenge (Autonomous cars). Wonderful to see how a different university system works.

But there isn't really. Transport by ship: Rotterdam, Antwerp, Bremen and Hamburg handle the shipping from and to the mainland EU (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_ports_in_Europe). 

1. Rotterdam: 11.145 TEU
2. Antwerp: 8.468 TEU
3. Hamburg: 7.895 TEU
4. Bremen: 4.888 TEU
5. Valencia: 4.206 TEU

(Felixstowe is at place 6 with 3.400 TEU. I.e. the first five ports in the EU combined are 10 times the size of the largest UK port. The trade with the Commonwealth isn't really showing up, or is it?).

By air: the busiest cargo airports in the EU are (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic):

1. Charles de Gaulle, Paris, France, 2.4 Megaton
2. Frankfurt, Germany, 2.3 Megaton
3. Heathrow, London, 1.5 Megaton
4. Schiphol, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 1.5 Megaton (basically same size as Heathrow)
5. Findel, Luxembourg, Luxemburg, 0.7 Megaton

road, ferry and train to and from the UK always go via mainland EU so these statistics are irrelevant.
Thus when Britain would leave the EU not only the City is at risk, but also the economic position of Heathrow as a semi-major airport cargohub in the EU, and also Felixstowe will notice I suspect.
Dreaming dreams is nice, but cash is better. My bet stands safe and firm.

Edit: corrected Felixtowe to Felixstowe.

""The eurozone is becoming a vehicle for German mercantilism, whereby the German people are first beggared in order subsequently to beggar others. This situation is manifestly untenable. It brings unemployment, destroys productive capacity and spreads hopelessness across Europe.""

The entirety of the problem faced by the eurozone is due to a balance of payments crisis: in short german unit-costs are too competitive vis-a-vis its neighbours which exports jobs and borrowed money from those neighbours into germany.

As the largest economic unit within the eurozone, and the most damagingly competitive, if germany is serious about saving the currency union it needs to inflate away its labour cost advantage by increasing spending and benefits, encouraging german consumers to spend and allowing neighbouring countries to sell.

If germany is intending to introduce the largest post-war austerity package after in 2014 it doesn't bode well for its commitment to the eurozone. It will lock club-med into yet more years of huge unemployment through grinding internal devaluation.

If you want to take your US phone number with you and you're not worried about the contract implications to your current cell provider, go ahead and register for Google Voice at least a week before you leave, and as part of it transfer your current cell phone number to Google Voice.    At the same time (or day or two before if you can't be without cell service for a day), get a unlocked GSM phone (such as the Google Nexus that someone mentioned - several friends use it and it's awesome), get an almost free ($1 on the web) prepaid SIM from Tmobile and use the $3/day unlimited calling+SMS+200MB-daily-high-speed Internet for your remaining time there.  You'll be able to use your current number via Google Voice, then take it with you to Germany.

Once you get to Germany, go to a Media Markt or Conrad and wander to the wall of different prepaid cell vendors and set up a prepaid cell plan and get a SIM.  Only issue is that none of them have high MB limits for their prepaid cell plans, but they'll all default to low-speed (64 kbps) coverage once you're over the monthly/daily maximum - which is still enough for Google Maps to work, luckily - but browsing the web/facebook can be a bit slow.  Make sure you have your passport and temporary address with you (you don't need an anmeldung/city registration) to get the best cost (free) for your starter SIM.  Cheapest smartphone plans are on the order of 10 Euro/month + 9 Euro cents per minute of calls.

Google Voice won't work exactly the same in Germany, but you can purchase GrooveIP from the Android market and make calls using VOIP over Google Chat using your US number.  If you're in a high-bandwidth zone (i.e., haven't used up your high-bandwidth allotment that month or are in a wifi-coverage area), you can actually make Google Voice calls to Germany more cheaply than with your cheap prepaid plan (i.e., 2 US cents per minute rather than 9 Euro cents per minute), and calls to the US will be free.

TL;DR - Order [Google Nexus](https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_4_16gb) and [$1 Tmobile SIM](http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-phone/T-Mobile-Prepaid-SIM-Activation-Kit), then migrate current cell number to [Google Voice](https://www.google.com/voice), use Tmobile+Google Voice in US for [$3/day](http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/pay-by-the-day-cell-phone-plans), then get cheap prepaid SIM in Germany ([here](http://www.conrad.de) or [there](http://www.mediamarkt.de)) and continue to use Google Voice with [GrooveIP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gvoip&amp;hl=en) in Germany.

Much depends on how the article ended with this particular number. Are married couples with children counted? What of common law marriages (as less than half of couples actually marry in Finland)?  What about divorced couples where the children live permanently with one parent but visit their other parent on the weekends? And what about the ""ideal"" situations where children have rooms with both parents and split time 50/50 between them (these have started to get more popular during the recent years).

And are children where one parent is dead excluded? You can never be sure.

However; of the divorced couples, only 4% go to court over children. We may assume that the large majority of 96% would decide upon shared custody, and that most of those 4% would be opposed to such arrangement. Some wouldn't, but most would. AND AS IT HAPPENS, 96% is very close to 95,2% given in the article. 

**TL; DR** I believe that the number is correct, under certain conditions.

Same thing with easter.. if someone could in ANY  reasonable way explain the connection between bunnies, eggs, colored feathers and chocolate with the death of earlier mentioned dude in Israel... Then I'd be really baffled...

So, christmas originated in Yule and the midvinterblót due to the winter solstice, midsummer is the obvious counterpart, easter is the equinox blah blah. 30april/1may got replaced by some improvised story about a saint, St. Lucia is the cover-up for Berchta, Holda, Weisse frauen etc etc.. . so sick of ppl celebrating stuff we don't even remember or stuff that's been pushed aside due to christian attitude towards other rituals and ceremonies.. bah... and why do we eat ham in the celebration of a dude born in a part of the world that forbids the consumption of pork entirely.. yea, that's a mindboggler! ^^

I think Erasmus goes under the education budget, and usually education is a good investment. I think stopping to educate people because a financial tough time, is shooting yourself in the foot. If anything, it might be better having people in uni, than out, unemployed. 

You do have some valid points though, I haven't seen an analysis of how benefitial it is to society. However, educate people at university, is usually good, and thus, Erasmus can be good.

true,tugasnake,PORT,Portugal,"&gt;This is one of those issues where there's not a correct stance. I do believe that it's an important mission of a country's legislation to protect people against discrimination, the same way other human rights are covered. It's the same principle that makes it, for example, so in most countries a supermarket can't refuse to serve a black person just because the owner is a racist.

I believe it's more important to uphold liberty than to prevent discrimination. Relations should be voluntary and if a supermarket owner doesn't want to serve blacks he should be able to do so without being forced by the state to do otherwise.

&gt;I don't think a biological parent (who is giving up all responsibility over him or her) should be able to deny said child any possibility.

I don't think they have any call on the matter after they give away the child for adoption, but before that they should have the option to choose which orphanage they like the most and I see nothing wrong with there being the choice of picking between institutions that allow for gays to adopt and others that do not.",0,1356881376,null,0,false,0,c7o9ne9,t3_15ms3c,t1_c7o9ne9,t1_c7nza05,null,1430807784,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,anarchisto,ROMA,Romania,"Romania: Virtually all doctors and nurses within the state hospital system receive informal payments from patients. In many cases, it's required and paid in advance, as the doctors and nurses would ilegally refuse treatment if they don't receive any money, this is especially true for surgery or giving birth. In surgery, the sums required by the doctors often reach thousands of euros.

In hospitals, the nurses refuse to give any attention to patients who don't give them any money, or if they are forced to do it, they do their job badly, like intentionally inflicting pain when giving an injection.

As a case I know, a second degree cousin of mine had a serious complication during childbirth and the child died, while she was left in critical state. The doctor at Târgoviște hospital hinted that unless the family would pay a sum, she could die, too. 

The alternative for ""state-funded"" medicine are private practices and hospitals, but probably less than 5% of the population can afford it, and even if you afford it, they have inadequate equipment. The politicians (including our President) typically fly to Austria, Germany or France for any surgery or other medical intervention.

The salaries of the doctors and nurses are very low, leading to a large ""brain drain"" of the doctors toward West (especially France, which has a shortage for countryside doctors which has been filled with Romanians).

The French tax system also has plenty of loopholes, of course: so unless you're suggesting that that of the US in the 50's had significantly *more* than that of present-day France (I don't know one way or another, but it's not obvious in any case), it makes sense to just compare the top rate.

Concerning the *effective* average tax rate of top incomes, after tax deductions of all sorts, [this paper](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/fichiers/public/PikettySaezJEP2006.pdf) offers a historical perspective and suggests that the top 0.01% of earners in the US paid about 70% (and for certain years up to 75%) of their total income in federal taxes from 1960 through 1977, compared to about 35% in 2005 (see table A4j).",0,1356886052,null,0,false,0,c7oaine,t3_15mdr0,t1_c7oaine,t1_c7o9w9b,null,1430808192,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

This is a myth. Sure, education is good, but there is a point where more education does not pay off. Consider you were given a wish from a Genie from a bottle. And you choose ""make all the people in my country have a university degree and knowledge like they did study"".

*Poof*. It happens. But does it really changes anything? No, it doesn't. Most of the jobs on the market are still services. Someone still has to clean offices, deliver pizza, be receptionist and stuff like this. In real economy not all people have to be scientists and engineers. Not until we have robots to do all the non-creative stuff.

While the elementary education might always be paying off, because it shapes the society, it's morals and social norms, the higher education in todays Europe is in 80% (pulled this out of my ass, but the number is not a point) a waste. 5 years that young, vital person could be working for society, creating goods and added value, paying taxes and saving for future is wasted on learning something that market does not need.

Especially social studies are total waste. Why would market need more than just a few experts in this matters? Are you aware that in USSR there were popular studies called ""Sovietology""? Studying the beauty of Soviet Union philosophy and inner-working. The same crap that ""European studies"" are nowadays. And USSR go bankrupt, collapsed and exploded just like UE will soon. Because of unreasonable spending in the name of socialism.  

&gt; If they wanted to start cutting down (...) I think (...)

It's irrelevant what you and I think. The free market is 99% of a time near optimum way to allocate resources. Any cuts are good cuts. How can Europe be competitive when we are taxing everything: personal income, capital gains, spending (VAT), savings (inflation), property, gasoline, and so on. Not only we are overtaxed, but also goverments are in such a massive debt because they were spending like crazy promising to give back latter. On what were they spending this money?

I can't tell you how many times I had to ask where something was, or how to get somewhere, and knowing some basic directional vocabulary is something that REALLY helped me out.

As someone stated previously, coffee shops and small bakeries do offer WiFi, so take advantage of that to use any sort of map/GPS function on your phone if you are feeling flustered and/or confused. There's a Starbucks right outside of the U-Bahn station at the popular stop of ""Alexanderplatz"" and they have free WiFi. Their WiFi is still usable even after their closing time, but I can't confirm if it indeed runs all night. Just a small tip if you feel completely overwhelmed, this may be a good place to just stop by and regroup. There is also a huge Saturn store here if you want to buy any sort of small prepaid phone (which is what I did), or you can also find many other mobile options here.

But it's beauty will sustain you for all of the time you are there.  Walk around the city.  Get out in the evening.  The Spanish live outside, and this is especially true of the people of Salamanca.  Come 7 PM or so the city is alive and everybody is out for a walk, shopping, a bite to eat, whatever.  

I will give you some food recommendations as I've been to nearly every restaurant in the city from my years in the city:

**El Patio Chico** - This place has a great menu del dia with many choices and great tapas too.  It is filled with locals and tourists alike.  They have two locations.  The one a little further in the plaza is better in my opinion.  

**El Patio Cordobés** - This is off the beaten path a little bit but I love this place because their menu changes every day but the food is always really good.  The price is reasonable.  It's a local's kind of place.  

**La Posada** - This is more formal, and more expensive than most, but worth it in my opinion.  I know you're a student but if you need a formal meal (parents visiting?) this is the place.

Tapas:

**Bambu** - Right next to the plaza.  Pretty damn good tapas.  Prices are ok.  Feel free to throw napkins on the floor in Salamanca, it's a compliment to the chef.  This place gets very crowded.  

**El Reloj** - In the plaza (which usually means it's touristic and expensive and thus better to avoid) but this place shouldn't be missed.  Get their huevos rotos and you will just about die.  

**Calle Van Dyck** - Very hard to go wrong.  This will be your hub of tapas for your entire stay.  Walk around, try them all, enjoy!

**El Yunque** -  After a late night of drinking, go to this place and get an amazing sandwich.  

The other comment on this thread covered so much that I think you have some good advice.  Enjoy your time in Salamanca!  ",0,1356890915,null,0,1356891265,0,c7obmpe,t3_15nthv,t1_c7obmpe,t3_15nthv,null,1430808721,2,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,2

Some, usually older, people, who lived when Poland was under communist rule, tend to give some gifts to doctors - keep in mind that most of the doctors in Poland started their career before the ZSRR fell - to get better services. 


It is basically either a bribe or a reward for service. Of course nowadays it is usually not money  - I believe that if you walked to a doctor's office and offered him an envelope with a sum of money inside, and he has never treated you before, he would excuse himself for a moment and call the police. 

During early 2000's many doctors were caught on camera taking bribes, which costed them their job. But a bottle of wine, or some other kind of alcohol is not considered a bribe, yet it works well. It can get you ahead of other patients, might cause doctor to examine you more often. 

Of course if it is your family doctor, a bottle of something nice is some kind of investment for your future, as it makes the doctor remember you, and you can count on better treatment in the future.

Me or my parents have never given a gift to a doctor, and I don't support it. It is just something that remained in the culture after these strange times before 1989.

Something related - in the 90's you could easily bribe yourself off a ticket. If you tried that nowadays, you would probably get arrested, because the policeman would have more to lose than to gain.

You'd be out of the market and there would be tariffs imposed on British products just like they're imposed on goods from elsewhere. Also, you'd still have to comply with EU regulation for the products sold to the common market, which is still by far your largest buyer.

I'm currently studying at the Rhine - Waal University, I hope that I can be of help. 

&gt;1.How hard is it getting into an university in the North Rhine-Westphalia region?

That depends on the university and the study course. 

&gt;2.How much money do i need to pay per year to study on average?

Also strongly depends where you're going to study. From a few hundred up to some thousand euro per semester. 

&gt;3.I know a little german,and I have an FCE certificate in english.I also know the balkans languages.What courses/classes will I have to enroll at,and how long would they take?

You will study at least 7 semester until you get your bachelor's degree, the rest is up to you. 

&gt;4.When does the application sending begins?

Usually in May and ends in July. 

&gt;5.The visa process for students.

That's something I can't help you with. 
Some solid advice I can give you is to take a look at the daad Homepage, there you will find all the answers you seek. 
Feel free to send me a message with any questions you might have.
Cheers

Yup

&gt;Oh, I still disagree with you about the ""let the institutions decide"", this is about adoption, not about the transaction of goods and services, one should be free to do as he pleases as long as it isn't harmful to others - someone not allowing gays to adopt is extremely harmful to the children, they're not cattle nor are they property owned by the institutions who take care of them or their foster parents, under no circumstance should they be denied parents, if the people who're taking care of them disapprove of them being adopted by a gay couple, too fucking bad, they don't own the children and **can't decide for them if their new parents are appropriate or not.**

One of the main responsibilities of an orphanage is to look after it's children and make sure that they get suitable parents. To say that they can't decide if their new parents are appropriate or not is bullshit. And that's the main question: do gays make suitable parents? Some believe they do and some do not, personally I believe that in average traditional couples offer a far better growing environment to a child, but since there are not enough of those looking to adopt and imo it's best for a child to have a family than to live in an orphanage then I'm ok with gays adopting.

Yes, unemployment is bad.

&gt;particularly not as necessary work requiring human input becomes more and more scarce, and the increasingly limited resources of the planet are unnecessarily wasted to further concentrate wealth in the hands of another group of idlers.

Concentration of wealth? Like when there's inequality?

It's a private University in Spain that gives grants to university students to study English for a week on a intensive speaking course.

The course starts again in March/April. But before then companies have to compete to win the contract (I think it's worth millions). Last year Berlitz had the contract, and before them a company called Vaughan had it.

The Government will decide in Jan/Feb who gets it, so I'd look on their websites around then if you're still looking for work.

You don't need a qualification. If Vaughan get it (they're another option to work for, asides from the UIMP. Not a very nice company imo, but pay on time and can give hours) to do the course you'd have to pass their training course (worst 2 weeks of my life!!).

And if it's Berlitz you'd have to do their training course, but it wasn't very difficult.

The way the job works is you work in groups of 3 teachers, who have 15ish student in 3 classes (3 teachers. 3 classes. 15 students). The classes rotate so you teach everyone. It's a speaking course so the idea is to improve their oral agility (that's what she said), rather than to go through the nitty-gritty grammar points.

It's a laugh, the students are young and normally cool.

It's intensive, I worked 9-6.15pm, and you have to eat with them at lunch time too. But the pay was good, 2000€ before tax. I got about 1600€ at the end of the month.

And you can work in different sites (each have different amounts of teachers) like Madrid, Barca, Seville, Granada, La Linea, Huesca, La Coruña, Santander, Valencia, Cuenca, Tenerife (I think that's it).

Only thing is, I don't think either company sorts out your papers/visas (I'm guessing you're American).

People have tried that in the past and it never works, people aren't willing to sell if the benefit from it is less than the opportunity cost, the moment you were to appropriate of such houses, they'd disappear and be converted into warehouses or offices or whatever, people would do everything to dodge seeing their property taken away from them.

Oh, and homelessness isn't a sickness one can catch, anyone can work and buy a house - chances are that if you're homeless then it's your own damn fault, only junkies and gamblers lose everything including their own house and can't work enough to buy one back, it's not sustainable to have those who work paying for the expenses of those who don't or who do but can't manage their money.

true,Silly_little_thing,FRAN,France,"I'll contradict you in two ways: first, on the economy being the only (or overwhelmingly dominant) factor in choosing how to organize a society, and second, if we admit the former to be true, on the validity of the points you bring.  

So, what is (or should be) the purpose of a society? I think we will agree on at least two points: stability, and wealth. These are the basics. Now, are the amount of wealth and stability never enough, or will you agree with me if I say we can consider wealth to be satisfactory if regular people can live decent lives without struggling too much, and stability is satisfactory if laws are enforced, well-though and not too oppressive? I consider at least western european economies to be way past this point.  
From there, we are out of the jungle and no longer in an emergency situation, we have choices to make: what goals can we set?  

You can consider wealth to be never enough and try to keep a growing economy forever, I'll consider this possibility in the second part. For now, I'll just ask: what's the point? Material comfort is great, but do we need material luxury? Should we just, as a group of people, keep getting richer and live and die struggling for that arguably useless goal? This sounds fucking pointless my friend. You're a piece of meat, like it or not, and if you're one of these who find satisfaction in having just yet more useless stuff today than you had yesterday, your existence is kind of hollow. Greed is a feeling we've evolved in nature because we were constantly in need. If you are no longer in need but keep accumulating goods for the heck of it, out of mere greed, just because you want to, you're nothing more than a lost monkey, a misfiring robot unable to rethink its goals once the situation has changed, which keeps repeating the same task because he's hard-wired in order to do so. I don't know if it's your case, but I don't want to live in such a pointless society, I want mankind to get past this never-ending nightmare.  

You can otherwise set more “humanitarian” goals. We don't actually *need* a strong growth and, with a  relatively heavy taxation, we can afford a pretty complete welfare state, in order to reduce inequalities within the population, which in itself is a good thing as it reduces social tensions and makes the society as a whole more healthy, for a thousand reasons ranging from less stress to less development of diseases in impoverished populations.  

We can also make our population more educated: this is a good thing because the more educated (in *social sciences* among other things) a population is, the better a democracy works. Educated people are less likely to be manipulated, they commit less crime, they create more cultural content, and they are more susceptible to make us progress in various scientific fields. In that context, “more education is always a good thing” is not a fallacy, it's factual.  

As a long-term goal, we can also aim for the abolishment of human (physical) labor but as you said, we need moarrr robots. It may not be *that* far away, though. On the whole, the only real problem I can think of for that kind of society to work is fiscal evasion, but it is only a problem as long as most developed economies stay the way they are. To make that work, the only thing we need to do is to convince enough people, because as long as we play solo, we're fucked, and if we play coop, those who play solo (and make profit out of fiscal evasion) effectively have an advantage. This is a classical case of a [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma). Think of it next time you read people from the UK rejoicing here on /r/europe about rich french people fleeing to London to avoid taxes.  

Now, **the second part**: you're complaining about fallacies, but your reasoning isn't spared either. Provided the economy is the most important thing and we shouldn't educate people if it isn't useful, etc.
 
&gt;5 years that young, vital person could be working for society, creating goods and added value, paying taxes and saving for future is wasted on learning something that market does not need.

You said earlier that if we had a genius in a bottle to give a degree to everyone, it wouldn't be of any use because they still won't find work. There is already a very high pressure on jobs, with the mechanization of work I think it's unavoidable. The 18-24 of age already have tremendously high unemployment rates, what we need isn't more manpower. What you propose for these people is basically to do nothing and look for jobs that don't exist. 

&gt;Especially social studies are total waste. Why would market need more than just a few experts in this matters?

The market certainly doesn't need it, but the argument about the manipulation of masses still works here, if we value living in a democracy. Having a segment of the population who gets what's going on certainly is a security belt and prevents the kind of social crisis every early democracy went through. If we consider that only the market matters and not the democratic process, fine. Just saying. 

&gt; The same crap that ""European studies"" are nowadays.

What they call “European studies” isn't “studying the beauty of the EU philosophy and inner-working”, but actual, regular studies abroad with a few europe classes added in. This is not the same thing. And I seriously doubt a student program can make an entire continent go bankrupt, anyway. 

&gt; The free market is 99% of a time near optimum way to allocate resources. 

This is flat-out false. You may think it's right or wrong, but a free market generates an unequal society and it allocates resources with enormous disparities. This isn't a secret. 

&gt; How can Europe be competitive when we are taxing everything: personal income, capital gains, spending (VAT), savings (inflation), property, gasoline, and so on. 

We only need to be competitive for jobs that can be made abroad. In a services economy such as the western european ones, most of the jobs (more than 80% in France) can't go in china, you know?

Personally, I am a capitalist in the sense that I believe the most effective outcome will come from voluntary exchange. Allowing free markets to operate are essential to bettering the standard of living, not only for the rich, but also the poorest in a society.

I don't have an absolute faith in free markets though. There are certain sectors where private enterprise can be considered dangerous. I'm not going to start a big discussion of what the role of government should be , but enterprises such as the legal system, the penal system, military defense, health care etc are areas, where private interests can be hazardous to a society. Eg with health care private enterprise would at least introduce/worsen two situations: a) Produced/researched medicine and medical practice would be excluded to those ailments that are the most lucrative, b) The cost for the consumer will be maximised as to increase profit.

These sectors are best managed socialised, but everything else should be left to voluntary exchange with little to no regulation. This seems to be the core tenet of more European welfare states. Though the solutions differ eg Germany and Holland have mandatory private insurance coupled with public subsidies, whereas the Scandinavian countries have almost entirely socialised their health care systems.

The demarcation I have presented here regarding what sectors should be entirely left to voluntary exchange, which should be regulated and which should be socialised is by no means set in stone, and I would welcome feedback and/or criticism.

This quote from Friedrich Hayek sums it up greatly:

&gt;""There is no reason why in a free society government should not assure to all, protection against severe deprivation in the form of an assured minimum income, or a floor below which nobody need descend. To enter into such an insurance against extreme misfortune may well be in the interest of all; or it may be felt to be a clear moral duty of all to assist, within the organised community, those who cannot help themselves. So long as such a uniform minimum income is provided outside the market to all those who, for any reason, are unable to earn in the market an adequate maintenance, this need not lead to a restriction of freedom, or conflict with the Rule of Law.""

When it comes to the aim of a policy such as a policy of growth, I do not think growth has inherent value that makes it worth pursuing solely for the sake of growth. Europe stands in a crisis as European societies have been build upon the economic growth they have experienced throughout the last couple of decades. An recession is figuratively a kick in the groins and has a large impact on our daily life by cause of this. Worsened circumstances  are breeding grounds in the population for the ideas that we should actively do something to lessen the effects of a recession. Given the current democratic structure of most European countries, the burden is put on the shoulders of the politicians - a burden they have to take or they won't be reelected. To a great extent I think this has brought about the policy of growth that we see today where we, almost religiously, follow the development in our countries GDP. Whether this is a good thing or not is a complex issue I don't think I have the ability to resolve, though I suspect that if we acknowledged that a) our current standard of living is build on frail, unsustainable pillar that will eventually crumble and b) we will therefore, necessarily, have to lessen our standard of living, we'd have a more realistic chance of recovering.

Anyway, you are a racist, first and foremost. You think it is OK if people in Africa die, because they will die eventually anyway. You then refer to the Greeks as brown and lazy, something I never have. 

But the bottom line is that you describe Greeks as the perpetual victims, suffering unimaginable hardships. Have you ever been anywhere outside Western Europe, you would know that Greece is hardly hell on earth. 

But the Greeks, of course, has it worse than anyone else. 

The fact is, you are perfectly within your right to think so. The problem us when you want to use not your money (which you can spend on strippers for all I care), but the fact is that you demand taxpayers all over the world (yes, IMF has contributors from all over the world) and the EU to endlessly keep on paying for the Greeks, despite the fact that Greece is hardly the most down on its luck country out there. If you followed the debate, you'd also know that in comparison to other countries the IMF has helped, Greece has received very favourable conditions, something that it has drawn a lot of critisism for, from African states among others. Not that expect you to care, you explicitly said there was no use helping them getting HIV medicine, they were going to die of another disease anyway. Thank God that most people in the world don't think like you, but think HIV medicine can make a difference in the lives even for Africans. 


So, Greece has received special treatment every single step of they way, from getting their debt paid off by others, more favourable loans than other countries, more everything. Yet, they are your special little snowflake and you want more of other people's money for them. Why don't you pay? And, as I said before, a vote. Let the taxpayers of the world, or at least Europe, vote about if ""we want to take on more off Greece's debt , pay off more off their loans etc"". Who do you think would win? 

What is worse is that when I say that for my money I'd rather by HIV medicine in a truly poor country, you ridicule me, and make sure to let me know it is no use helping people there, they are corrupt and going to die of something else anyway. Apart from the fact you are a horrible human being, you are missing the point. It is my money- I do as I choose with them. You however, think it is OK, in an continuous breaking of the rules, ignoring the rules, smashing, crushing and not giving a single thought to them, that it's OK to take my, and other people's money to save your special snowflake Greece. Fine, save them, but follow the rules. Don't break them, what gives you the right. Don't use any money that you is outside the rules. 

This might surprise you, but a lot of people in Greece used to advocate for a default too. It would give them more freedom to control their own destiny, and many, the absolute majority I'd say of the Greeks do recognise that their behaviour is OK.

Actually the purpose of a society is security. It takes several forms: protection against natural forces, predators and other enemy societies, food security and shelter. To operate, a society needs cooperation, through which more can be achieved than by individuals alone. Like you mentioned this is similar to the prisoner's dilemma.

What the free market does is reintroduce inside the society the competition that society intended to protect individuals from. In the free market, actors need to play dirty to win the prisoner's game.

We can learn from game theory here : game theory has proven that overall the gain is higher if individuals cooperate, however the individual gain is higher for the traitor *if* people encounter each other rarely. As the size of our societies increase, the winning strategy becomes increasingly to betray your fellow.

However will it ever change ? As a Frenchman I'm not very optimistic. Our history shows that people in their majority don't mind being ruled and used by a small aristocracy.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;Anyway, you are a racist, first and foremost. You think it is OK if people in Africa die, because they will die eventually anyway. You then refer to the Greeks as brown and lazy, something I never have.

I never said it's ok people die, in Africa or elsewhere: I said it's an inefficient use of money to supply humanitarian aid to an unstable society. You on the other hand don't care if the Greeks lose healtcare access (or as was in the news recently, can't afford heating oil and have to burn wood, killing people by air pollution), which kills people... and why? Because ""they should be more productive and less corrupt"". It's a typical racist stereotype about southerners; you didn't mention brown, but I just added it to make it clear what you were saying: I'm sorry if the truth about yourself upsets you.

&gt;The fact is, you are perfectly within your right to think so. The problem us when you want to use not your money (which you can spend on strippers for all I care), but the fact is that you demand taxpayers all over the world (yes, IMF has contributors from all over the world) and the EU to endlessly keep on paying for the Greeks, despite the fact that Greece is hardly the most down on its luck country out there.

And why do they get these conditions? Because their default will trigger other defaults, who will trigger other defaults and so on. The IMF is protecting the financial system, not the Greeks (the IMF is not, and will never be, a charity organisation). They're just the weakest link in the global financial system, which has become too leveraged to keep functioning properly. Scapegoating the Greeks does not solve the problem; indeed, it makes it worse by wasting time.

&gt;It is my money- I do as I choose with them.

Finally, you bring forward your real conviction. You're still short-sighted and selfish, but somewhat less hypocritical.

&gt;This might surprise you, but a lot of people in Greece used to advocate for a default too. It would give them more freedom to control their own destiny, and many, the absolute majority I'd say of the Greeks do recognise that their behaviour is OK.

It's too late for that, too much hinges on it. If Greece fails, Spain and Italy will fail. If those fail, the EU will fail, and then the world economy is in the gutter as well.

Economy can grow endlessly. I could employ people to:

* teach me something (for fun)
* make me a massage
* keep me in good health
* make my food shopping
* and so on, so on...

We could also be designing starships and colonizing space.

The jobs for young people don't exist because socialistic politicians took resources from economy and spent them on stupid ideas likeeg.  Erasmus. 

And now your saying that we need to waste more of resources just to keep people silent? Bravo!

&gt;  free market generates an unequal society and it allocates resources with enormous disparities. This isn't a secret.

Materialistic inequality isn't a problem. It's only problem for socialists that some people can be richer then others, so they prefer making everyone poorer just for the sake of equality. You know when we were all almost equal? When we were living in caves. That's where any socialism leads.

In any case my point was that while yes we bred dogs to hunt with/for us, we never bred them for company until many thousand years after that point.

Like when they're taxed at 100% and there's no private property and all they produce goes to the state? You're deluding yourself if you think socialist states properly remunerate their workers, if anything, it's these very same states that most resemble slavery.

&gt;You obviously don't know much about capitalism either, capitalism has very little to do with free markets, indeed, many would say it represents the antithesis of them.

Capitalism = defending private property
Free market = allowing people to trade said private property

Again, how are these the anti-thesis of each other?

&gt;Right... You compassionate conservatives, we love you so much.

Hey, don't blame me, if you really care about them, you can engage in charity, there's absolutely nothing stopping you from letting two homeless sleep into your house and let them sleep in your couch or floor or wherever.

Just don't say it's anyone's fault but their and their family's one if they end up homeless and say others or the state ought to provide from them.

Oh, and I'm not a conservative.

&gt;This isn't going to be some tired old bollocks about the USSR, China, Cambodia and so on is it?

You're the one saying capitalism is inefficient and talking about the USA, if have no idea of how socialism is like then at least try to learn how it always goes wrong whenever people have tried to implement it, there's plenty of countries to read about and their experiences with socialism.

&gt;It's private property that gets enforced, not the other way around. How does a capitalist enforce his/her absentee ""rights"" without the State's bully boys?

Absentee rights? What do you mean? That the factory one paid to build and the workers he continues to pay for them to work shouldn't benefit the investor because of the arbitrary criteria that he might not be inside the factory?

Oh, even without a state, I'm sure one could enforce property rights, though it's much wiser to leave that to the state as they should be the only one with a monopoly on violence and who own the courts, the alternative would be anarchy.

People like you who want to turn the system upside down and to appropriate of the property of others, you're crazy, you'll just drive them away and kill all the incentives there is to invest if you got to decide and said that ""all the profits go to the state"", as I'm sure even you agree that nobody would be as willing to go trough all the trouble of starting a business and making it as profitable and efficiently run as possible if they got 0.001% of the returns as opposed to 100% or 80% or 50% depending on the tax rates.

&gt;A person works, they get the full benefit; a coop works, the coop gets the full benefit; a collective works, the collective gets the full benefit; a community works, the community gets the full benefit; a society works, the society gets the full benefit; a world works, the world gets the full benefit as does each and every individual - none excluded.

So people work and they get paid? Great, that sounds efficient!

But what about those who don't work? Will they not get paid? Dude, that sounds highly unfair!

&gt;Sounds much better than the current system.

Sounds a lot like the current system. If ""a person works, they get the full benefit"" is your alternative, then you're even more laissez-faire than I am, that would imply no taxes at all!

My mother was a doctor. For 10 years or more we never had to buy a single pack of coffee. People would usually show with it and sometimes get VERY offended if she refused to take the present. Once, a peasant presented her with a living lamb, tied to a tree in front of the ambulance. Of course, she never asked for any of it. People would get the same treatment no matter what they brought her.

Here, people look at it more like a gesture of politeness. Few years ago I was forced by my parents to give a present to a doctor in private clinic for a procedure I already paid for. Yeah, I know how that sounds to you westerners.

But it's not same as the bribe. Bribe is a category of its own here. Doctors who take bribes will ask for money ON TOP of the presents. It is usually done for larger procedures and very frustrating because, of course, the doctor will not take money openly but at the same time he will not treat a patient well until he receives money. You have to make connections with nurses, ask around with previous patients to actually discover how to give a bribe. These doctors are a minority but they do exist.

The third category is a ''connection'' or ''štela'' and it is more powerful than the money. It requires of you to know a doctor or talk to someone who knows a doctor to get a proper treatment. If you have a ''connection'' you can go to treatment faster, without paying, without bribing, without waiting in lines and so on.

Near homelessness, yes but homeless no, not here in Portugal where people have families and an welfare state and so on. Heck, one of my greatest rl friend went to school in Bairro do Cerco, that place is awful, the people there in very bad conditions, and they all still have roofs over their heads.

To say like he did that there's homes and there's homeless people, sure, it sounds appealing, but to force it doesn't benefit society, if the owners don't lend them or sell them then it's they did it would be at their loss, I'm sure everybody wants to be charitable with other people's property but you can't decide ""this house looks like we could fit in here two more people"" and two arrumadores get live in there.

We have already social benefits and social houses and social care and charity organisations providing food and clothing to the needy, if you're also going to give away housing then you're both promoting people to not do anything as all their expenses are covered and you're also promoting people to convert their houses into something else to avoid losing their property (just like what happened when there was set a maximum price for the rents and people converted their houses which were formerly for habitation into offices and such, as they couldn't afford to keep them under the new prices - that or they abandoned them and now there's plenty of zones which are highly degraded and the state is now having to, on its own expense, repairing the buildings like the ones downtown).

Right, but we already have help programs, social workers, social neighbourhoods and an whole system built around this to prevent just this. To do asDogBothered said and also give housing away to these people, that's not helping in anything.

No, you didn't. You said :

&gt;Preventing that will prevent much more harm than giving HIV blockers to someone in Rwanda, so he can die from another cause

So, what you are saying is that preventing that (Greece's horrible, suffering, they are suffering so much more than anyone else) is better than helping someone dying from AIDS.

Apparently you do not know much about HIV/AIDS, but the thing is that HIV medicine is not inefficient, even if *you* say it is. It actually prolongs life for people and gives them a chance to raise their children. I am going to give you some  links and I'd like for you to explain to me why giving someone in Africa HIV medicine is necessary inefficient (from a financial standpoint or just life expectancy standpoint). You are the one who said it was useless - but the links from reputable news sources and organisations says HIV medicine isn't useless. Can you provide me with links and arguments to why it is useless giving Africans HIV medicine? Also, you claimed that they just die anyway, but according to all the links I am about to pepper you with, it prolongs life significantly. So, again please explain your statement 

[Link 1- Unaids. Lot of useful information. Here you can see that it actually does make a difference and it prolong life from those suffering from AIDS](8http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/regions/easternandsouthernafrica/) [Link 2](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/03/aids-drugs-south-african-life).

&gt;can't afford heating oil and have to burn wood, killing people by air pollution

I'd like to point out that again, you brought up the issue of pollution and heating, I didn't. I never said that I like that *some* Greeks can't afford their heating. I do however, don't think that is the only country in the world that is happening in, and frankly, not even the only country in Europe. 

 You do know that it is a real problem (wood burning) since millions of people are dying from this every year, in Africa and Asia (India for example). But since it is now happening a bit in Greece, you think it is important enough to use *European taxpayers money* for it, against the rules.  I however, have some interesting facts about it, and I hope that you still stand by your statement that the air pollution problem is so horrible, after you have researched it that a lot of money need to be allocated.


I'd also like to point out that the air pollution from wood that you are mentioning is much worse in Africa/Asia, since Greeks tend not to live in a single room with one open fire, which is the one that kills people (more directly) from lung cancer and is really bad. The general pollution from wood heating is more ""general"", to be honest, bad, but not connected to deaths in the same way. The Greeks use wood more for heating, just like in Sweden.

The heating/air pollution thing is actually a thing in Sweden too, a very, very, big thing. In the countryside, a lot of people still heat their houses with wood, since it is cheap, and on a cold day, the air can be a lot worse in  a village  than in Stockholm. I am *so* glad that you are starting to think about this, and I'd really love for you to allocate *a lot* of other countries tax payers money to deal with the air pollution. In Sweden 25 %(!) of all houses are heated with wood, so we have it a lot worse than Greece, when it comes to air pollution from wood.  Or,why is the air pollution worse for the Greeks than for Swedes, Finns, Poles etc ?Shouldn't we get the money then to battle the air pollution? And we have it colder too. [Here](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedeldning) is the link in Swedish. I couldn't find any in English, but being Dutch you might get some of it, and you can see the 20-25 % in the first paragraph. EU money, please come! Until you brought up the suffering of the Greeks from the few thousand households that heat with wood, it hadn't even crossed my mind that Sweden were suffering, just that Sweden were polluting, which is not good, of course. But from a pollutant point of view, we are suffering way more than the Greeks. 

Then - why is it bad being brown? I'd like for you to explain that to me, since you brought it up as something that is bad.I never, ever mentioned it.

Also, you do not seem to understand the difference between low productivity and laziness. One can be a working 16/hours day, the year around, and have a very low *productivity*, as in not as much is being *produced* even if one work very hard. Laziness, that is when one do not work at all. To illustrate. A Somali farmer probably works more hours at his/her farm than a Danish farmer, but they probably have a lower *productivity*, due to lack of equipment, fertilizers, irrigation, allocation of recources etc.  No one is however saying that the Somali farmer worked less, just that they *produced less*. The Somali farmer was *not* lazy.

I wrote that the Greeks have low *productivity*, compared to other European countries, not that they were lazy. You were the one who wrote that. You are constantly trying to make things up about me and pretend that I have written things that I haven't,  and it is honestly getting tiresome. Get your facts straight. You write the racist stuff, not me.

Then I have written that Greece is corrupt. I have also illustrated that with a report from Transparency International who says that they on average pay €1406/year. That is a lot in Europe, if you didn't know that, and yes, that makes Greece corrupt. Since you still seem to doubt that Greece is corrupt, I'd like for you to take a look at this yearly report from Transparency International that put Greece on number 94 on the ""corruption list"". That is a lot if you compare it to other countries in the EU and the Eurozone.   Worst in the EU, and almost in Europe.  If you look back at the results you can also see that Greece has *fallen*, from number 80 in 2011. So apparently, they are bribing even more in Greece, despite your claims that they are not corrupt. [Link of course](http://www.transparency.org/cpi2012/results). Please, say why this is wrong and Greece is not corrupt. Also, explain to me how they can be workin against corruption when they are falling on the list.

&gt;Because their default will trigger other defaults, who will trigger other defaults and so on. 

No, not necessarily. Provide proof for that statement please. You claim a lot of things, but you are very, very bad at backing up anything.  In particular, since what the countries have been doing in the last year is making sure that their banks are safe etc, so no, if Greece falls, it falls, it does not have to mean the downfall of Italy etc.

&gt;Finally, you bring forward your real conviction. You're still short-sighted and selfish, but somewhat less hypocritical.

You are a hypocrite (and racist). You supporting taking my money, and other tax payers money in a way even you admit is undemocratic, and you call me a hypocrite. What gives you the right to take other peoples money, against rules and regulations? Do I have a right to take your money, against rules, treaties and regulations, just because I feel so sorry for some country who decided to borrow its way to bancruptcy. Of course I don't, I think everyone has a right to have their say. You do not however, since you are supporting not following the rules, taking the money from the taxpayers without asking. How can one be more of a non democrat than that? 


&gt;It's too late for that, too much hinges on it. If Greece fails, Spain and Italy will fail.

Proof, please

&gt;If those fail, the EU will fail,

You do know that there is a difference between the Euro and the EU- right? The EU can continue, even if your pet project doesn't. 

&gt;Just say goodby to your 19th century perception of the world: countries are not independent entities anymore.

Countries never were, again you are trying to give me opinions I never had. Just look at Greece, most certainly not independent in 19th century


Again, you are non democratic, but you are trying to hide that since it is ""necessary"". It is never necessary to sacrifice democracy, which you are in favour of doing. I shudder at your racist, dictatorship world.

No, what I 'hate' is British involvement in what is the logical end-point of ever-closer-union; a federal EU. 

So, I will be delighted to remain part of the EU as long as we remain a sovereign nation-state, but if there is no room for this in what will emerge from the euro-crisis as a converged euro-core then I will sadly vote to leave the EU when the referendum arrives.

That is not a sovereign nation-state, that is a Sanjak such as Greece was and is again today.

The problem is not new either, it has been recognised since at least the time of Gladstone:

""The finance of the country is intimately associated with the liberties of the country. It is a powerful leverage by which English Liberty has been gradually acquired … It lies at the root of English Liberty, and if the House of Commons can by any possibility lose the power of the control of the grants of public money, depend upon it, your very liberty will be worth very little in comparison …That power can never be wrenched out of your hands… That powerful leverage has been what is commonly known as the power of the purse – the control of the House of Commons over public expenditure – your main guarantee for purity – the root of English liberty. No violence, no tyranny, whether of experiments or of such methods as are likely to be made in this country, could ever for a moment have a chance of prevailing against the energies of that great assembly. No, if these powers of the House of Commons come to be encroached upon, it will be by tacit and insidious methods, and therefore I say that public attention should be called to this.""

So, we must all hope that Van Rompuy and Verhofstadt get kicked into touch, for our federal 'masters' either make room for a two-tier europe (with the UK acting as a template to which others can follow), or we will leave.",0,1356955298,null,0,false,0,c7oq8qk,t3_15pc4h,t1_c7oq8qk,t1_c7oq5tu,null,1430815753,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The problem is that eating peoples penises can not be accurately pinpointed to a specific group of people, while spraying girls with acid can. 

It is irrelevant whether _all_ members of a group spray girls with acid. You can still accurately specifiy which group does it. Not _all_ Germans tossed millions of Jewish children alive into ovens, but it is still accurate to say that out of millions existing groups on the planet only that single group of people did it and no other group did.

So to solve a problem, you do not have to pretend that spraying girls with acid happens randomly all over the planet in all existing groups, and apply pressure randomly on all groups. You have to apply pressure only on one single group you can identify. To prevent Jewish babies getting tossed alive into ovens you only had to deal with Germans.

Do you actually read what I write? ""Preventing that will prevent much more harm than giving HIV blockers to someone in Rwanda"": a Greek default would probably push the world into a depression for one more decade, ruining millions of lives (people who can't get an education, people who can't get started in the labor market, people who are forced to sell their houses at a loss, etc). Yes, money is better spent that way than on emergency relief which will change nothing permanently.

The air pollution is an illustration that a) the Greeks are cutting their spending (which you claim they don't) and b) that they're experiencing real deteriorations of their living conditions (which you claim aren't bad enough to warrant aid).

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Here's how I look at it: The Free Market is the best (or least bad) way to handle the complexity of allocation of resources, except when it isn't.

It's not just about the economy, but let's start with that because it's easier to explain. An economy is highly complex. You have to allocate raw materials to capacity of workers and machines in a way to produce enough parts and refined materials to produce the products for which there is a demand, but ideally not waste too many resources on producing too much of them, and then you have to get them to where they're needed in time without wasting too much storage space. You also need a way to measure demand so you know what to produce in the first place. 

The Free Market solves this as a self-organizing system that optimized for financial cost as an evaluation function.

Now, this is imperfect, because not everything develops a price naturally, and because this simple algorithm has a tendency to get stuck in a local optima (say you try to find the highest mountain by always walking uphill -- you only end up on a hill, or a local mountain if you take sufficiently large steps, but probably not on Everest). What we as a society want is to allocate the available resources in a way that results in the highest possible standard of living for everybody, and in a sustainable manner. One company making a huge amount of money for the next quarter won't get us there.

So, the state needs to get involved. Sometimes it can use the inherent mechanisms of the Free Market to achieve its goals. This can be done by internalizing external cost (i.e., putting a price on effects that are beyond companies' balance sheets). If you want to reduce carbon emissions, tax them, then it becomes a cost factor and the market optimizes accordingly, that is it reduces emissions.  
This doesn't work with all issues, though. A company treating their workers as any other form of capital in an unregulated market would be quite successful, at least in the short run, and other companies would be forced to follow suit to keep cost down. Workers couldn't avoid such companies, because every one of them would have to do it to remain competitive. So, the state says you need to give each worker a certain amount of vacation days, you can't just fire them when they become pregnant, and you have to maintain a minimum standard of safety at the workplace, because that's what we as a society have decided to be beneficial for the whole. Since those rules apply to every company, the normal mechanism of the Free Market still works, and a race to the bottom is prevented.

There are other things the Free Market can't do by itself, even though it would benefit from it in the long run. The kind of research done by CERN or ITER is necessary for technological advancement (better products and a more efficient use of resources) and a higher standard of living for society, but it's very long term and it's difficult to predict and quantify the benefits. Besides, we don't want the results of fundamental scientific research to be proprietary, it's more efficient to pool resources and have everybody benefit instead of doubling or tripling the effort.  
It's similar with infrastructure like roads or public schools, where we (usually) pool resources as well and save ourselves paying for the overhead of metering usage. 

Now, in which areas and to which degree regulation is beneficial, when it makes sense to pool resources, how we redistribute wealth to achieve a just society we all want to live in, and what we as a society actually set as our concrete goals is a matter of debate and priorities. But overall, I think a well regulated Social Market Economy with publicly funded projects is the way to go.",0,1356957486,null,0,1356957698,0,c7oqg1a,t3_15pc4h,t1_c7oqg1a,t3_15pc4h,null,1430815849,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

It is a powerful leverage by which English Liberty has been gradually acquired … It lies at the root of English Liberty, and if the House of Commons can by any possibility lose the power of the control of the grants of public money, depend upon it, your very liberty will be worth very little in comparison …That power can never be wrenched out of your hands… That powerful leverage has been what is commonly known as the power of the purse – the control of the House of Commons over public expenditure – your main guarantee for purity – the root of English liberty. No violence, no tyranny, whether of experiments or of such methods as are likely to be made in this country, could ever for a moment have a chance of prevailing against the energies of that great assembly. No, if these powers of the House of Commons come to be encroached upon, it will be by tacit and insidious methods, and therefore I say that public attention should be called to this.""

Especially on the metro. Walk proudly and DO make eye contact with suspicious characters. If you show your awareness of them, they are far less likely to target you.

It's not a dangerous city but it is a city of thieves. You won't even realize your phone is missing until it's far too late and by then you'll be second-guessing yourself and wondering if you left it somewhere.

The city offers free Catalan courses, and if you have the time I would highly recommend taking them. 

Not bombarding shopkeepers etc with English is helpful, even the slightest amount of effort shown in Catalan or Spanish is appreciated.

Restaurant etiquette is very different from North America as well. Depending on how 'fancy' the place is, you either seat yourself or wait for the hostess to do so. At most places, after you place your order the server will only come back around if you make an indication that you need something. They are not being rude. Don't ask to split the bill, figure that out amongst you &amp; your friends. In general, it's much less shmoozy than N. American standards, which has its ups and downs. Upside? Not tipping :) 

(Unless you are eating somewhere really nice, or got excellent service. But it's definitely not the 15-20% we are used to).

Maybe people keep to themselves a bit more but there is no shortage of friendly people anywhere. I'm sure you'll be able to feel out who feels like talking to you and who doesn't.

You forgot the horrible - ""they are going to die anyway from another disease"". Well, my links proved you wrong, why can't you say that you are wrong then (I mean, we are *all* going to die from something at some point, but as the links explain, they are not just going to die from something else, they have a real chance of living a longer life). Also, as the links explained, they (the 40 million of them) contribute, since they are in their prime, a lot to society, so it is not just a band aid. Do you even know *anything* about HIV?  It is *not* just emergency relief, it is long term programs. Emergency relief is for example given to the refugees in Syria at the moment. Read the links for God's sake. [Here](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/topics/Pages/emergency-response.aspx) is a link of what emergency relief entails. Not HIV programs. Commitment for decades is not emergency relief.

&gt;a Greek default would probably push the world into a depression for one more decade,

Greece is 11 millions, they are not capable of pushing the world into depression. And, by now Europe have proper firewalls for its banks etc. Would it be fun  - no, but it is hardly like 11 million Greeks can push the world into world wide depression.


Frankly, thankfully, very few small countries have the ability to fuck up the world completely, and Greece isn't one of them . One of the few that comes to mind is Israel, and then it will hardly be over a default/depression, but a whole different game, entirely, more likely war in  the Middle East

Also, you never answered why 

a) it is bad to be brown

b) why the Greeks, who pay, on average 1406€/year to corruption and falling on the corruption list are *not* corrupt. Why are they falling if they are working against it, and, as you have mentioned, being monitored by outsiders. How are they responsible for that, for falling further down the scale? Or are you saying that they are not?

c) do you still think we should allocate money to stop the horrible air pollution that comes from burning wood (I must admit, I had a lot of fun at that one, one can tell that you are not from a country with forests and I doubt that you know a lot about environmental problems) or is that only relevant when it happens in Greece? You mentioned it before as an example of the suffering Greece. Since more Swede's are victim of this, are Swedes the sufferers now, or are Greek lungs somehow more sensitive than Swedish lungs? Should the EU still pay a lot of money to make sure that people don't have to burn wood? What do you think?


&gt;You can't be an island of prosperity in a sea of depression.

I never said that, I just said that *a collapse of the EU* wasn't necessary. I think it will be hard, but that one can pull through. Where did I write prosperity? And why do the EU has to collapse ust becuause the Euro is fucked up?

&gt;You act as if countries are isolated entities that can go bankrupt without anyone but their inhabitants noticing it. That's a 19th century idea.

That is not an argument for giving me opinions I have never held, or putting words in my mouth. I think you are a racist because what you have written about people of Africa, and your reference to brown and lazy, not because a lot of the racism we see today came into form in the 19th and 20th century, even though I could argue that your ideas and your viewpoints comes from that school of thought. 


&gt;They're elected representatives taking decisions. Last time I checked, it worked exactly like that in Sweden.

Yes, but we have this thing in Sweden called ""the law"". We have for example a law that says that we can not have a budget deficit that is more than 3 % . If you want to push a budget through, that has a 5 % deficit, you can't, even if you are elected, and in a majority. The budget will be shot down by the legal council and will not be accepted. The law can change of course, but I do think we have to have a 2/3 majority and of course, an *election* in between. You see  - *our* politicians are not above the law. The have to bend to it. 

It is the same for everything. Say, our politicians want to allow torture. Apart from signing all sort of international treaties, we do have it written in our constitution that it is not allowed. So, even if Reinfeldt want to torture someone, he has to wait, until we have had 2 elections, 2/3 majority, changing of the laws etc, and, trust me on this, a popular vote would be demanded too.  He can't just begin to torture someone ""because it is necessary"" (nevermind the international implications). It is the law, and he has to follow it. And, it is important that he does - don't you understand that. It is far to important decision to be taken by him alone.


Also, if some bureacrat,  let us just fun call him [Stefan Ingves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Ingves#Early_life) who accidently happens to be the head of the Swedish National bank, wants to spend all the banks money on prostitutes, and let Sweden's interest rate go up to 800 % - could he do that? No, because he is *a bureacrat*, he is supposed to *follow the rules* in other word, safeguard the stability of the Swedish Krona/economy etc. You do not do that if you have an interest rate of 800% and is spending billions on prostitutes. He would get fired, immediately (but, which is interesting, since we have an independent central bank, not by politicians, but by other bureacrats). Of course, over time, if the people choose to rather have a bureacrat who safeguards prostitutes, I am sure it could happen, but it is rather unlikely. Until then, he bloody better do his job.

The EU politicians and the EU bureacrats. however, are acting exactly the opposite of the Swedish politicians. Where a budget wouldn't be approved in the parlament since it was illegal, the EU gets sure money get passed out to countries outside of the budget. A bureacrat, acting way out of his league, and out of his authourity, would be fired - in the EU you hand over even more power to these non -elected people. 

So, how is that democrati?. Why isn't the EU safeguarding the democracy and following the rules when Sweden can. We did it when we had a 500 % interest rate and our krona fell with 25 % and a 20 % unemployment,so don't give me any bleeding stories  about how hard it is. *That* is truly being democratic - following the rules even when it is hard. Not torturing even when the person is bad and you want to, because it is wrong, and above all *illegal*. Beacuse you belive in, and serve, democracy, above all. Not Greece, not France, not Sweden - democracy. And you don't serve it by abandoning it because some bureacrat decides he wants to.  It is the same with the other rules, sticking to budget rules even when it is tough. I am not saying it is easy, but I am saying it is the only way to be democratic. The EU is not, and you do not seem to care one bit.

They're trying to further the single market and they've already done so much in removing trade barriers and allowing the free movement of people, goods, services and capital, that's just not true!

&gt;It over-regulates

We can change the laws and liberalise the market, it must go through the European Parliament.

&gt;the majority of nations in the EU seem to want either state capitalism

Bollocks, most EU nations are thankfully trying to reduce state intervention in the economy.

I could also look at the Labour governments there in the UK that were for 13 years in power till just recently and say that for some time there you wanted a degree of state capitalism and that's just not true, just like it isn't true when other EU member-states also elect centre-left governments.

&gt;or outright protectionism

Yeah, yeah, the French and CAP, CFP and all that, you're absolutely right, we need to stop this and to do that we could either leave the EU (totally not worth it), get opt-out clauses (like the UK has been doing for some time now whenever some bad idea comes along) or do the utmost to stop any such idea from being implemented on an EU scale (what we should be doing much better).

One thing is certain, the EU has already removed most if not all of the trade barriers within Europe itself, we just need to continue removing these barriers to trade for the rest of the world, and you'll have to agree with me that this will have a much stronger impact if we do it as the EU as opposed to some member-states on their own.

If the French campaign and threaten to veto if they don't get their way, you can do the exact same thing but against them, instead of talking shit about Brussels and leaving the French to tinker with it, do what they're doing and extend your policies for the whole EU, nobody will back socialist Hollande now when he'd doing fuck all in his own country and all his neighbours are now run by centre-right governments.

&gt;there are few that truly want a free market economy (with sensible laws to mitigate externalities). 

Few? You, Ireland, Iberia, Italy, Benelux, Germany, Austria and most of Central Europe, the Nordics and all of Eastern Europe. I'd say the exception are the French and perhaps Greece if they collapse but they're an exception, the rest of us want just that.. we can't let this European project be hijacked by the few who want to live at the expense of others.

&gt;So, no, I can't see that Brussels frees the market. Where it has tried in areas such as airport ownership and electricity it failed dismally and bent to politics far too quickly.

Brussels politics are European politics, they're in every way dependent in the member-states and in the European Parliament, you shutting yourselves of this is counter-productive and won't help you at all in freeing the market, and even if you do leave the EU, it would still be quite harmful for you if the Union did act against the free market, the best way there is to prevent this from happening is the ever increasing union you're so fearful of, the more we're in, the more we can control it and make sure it acts in the best interest of all countries and of economic prosperity.",0,1356963768,null,0,false,0,c7or6dt,t3_15pc4h,t1_c7or6dt,t1_c7oqt99,null,1430816195,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; I could also look at the Labour governments there in the UK that were for 13 years in power till just recently and say that for some time there you wanted a degree of state capitalism and that's just not true, just like it isn't true when other EU member-states also elect centre-left governments.

I wasn't trying to say the UK is exempt from these charges, but all the major EU economic policies seem to be tending towards state interference lately.

&gt; Yeah, yeah, the French and CAP, CFP and all that, you're absolutely right, we need to stop this and to do that we could either leave the EU (totally not worth it), get opt-out clauses (like the UK has been doing for some time now whenever some bad idea comes along) or do the utmost to stop any such idea from being implemented on an EU scale (what we should be doing much better).

The problem is that ""we"" free-market tending liberals appear to be in a minority across the EU. 

&gt; One thing is certain, the EU has already removed most if not all of the trade barriers within Europe itself, we just need to continue removing these barriers to trade for the rest of the world, and you'll have to agree with me that this will have a much stronger impact if we do it as the EU as opposed to some member-states on their own.

This is where the devil is in the detail, because yes, in principle I can see your point. However, it has a leaden weight attached to it in the form of nation states. France, Germany and the UK have all dragged their heels over the liberalisation of various industries and France in particular has used its heel-dragging to buy those companies from other nations so that it retains a competitive advantage and because target countries have correctly implemented the laws there is bugger all they can do to stop it. 

Germany almost weighed in when Vodafone took over Mannsman (sp) nearly a decade ago, France has refused to implement various laws and even in the cases where countries (including the UK) have simply ingored the rules the whole legal wrangling takes years....so yes, the laws may be there in principle but they are sometimes ignored in practice.

&gt; Few? You, Ireland, Iberia, Italy, Benelux, Germany, Austria and most of Central Europe, the Nordics and all of Eastern Europe. I'd say the exception are the French and perhaps Greece if they collapse but they're an exception, the rest of us want just that.. we can't let this European project be hijacked by the few who want to live at the expense of others.

Or to commit to the EU project like the French did as opposed to work only to delay their proposals and to get special clauses exempting us from it. If they can push legislation favourable to them, why can't we?

I chose an apartment and I felt it was the best choice, but like I said, plenty chose Onix and thoroughly enjoyed it. You are close to a metro and will always pass some small soccer fields where they play youth soccer. (I would always stop and watch from the above bridge and cheer them on when they scored an awesome goal, some of those little kids were crazy at soccer!)

And there are a lot of Americans and some other Europeans there for school, but the building can double as a hotel if I remember correctly so there are always some new people there. It's not easy to just strike up any old conversation with somebody, but it also is. It's really just like anywhere else and you need to feel out the situation... just be sure not to get tricked/weirded out by any creepy European guys, we had that happen with a few girls on our trip and had to step in. (This is NOT the case with every guy, once again common sense, you can make some very cool friends over there!)

Also, UAB is very nice, they have two campuses. One is extremely close to Las Ramblas and the other is in a beautiful old hospital complex. I thoroughly recommend exploring near the small campus near Las Ramblas, there is an awesome beer place with brews from around the world close to it and we would often stop in for a nice beer before class.

Basically you'll learn as you go... it's hard to listen to advice and apply it without experience, especially with such a change as studying abroad.

Just like your MPs? IIRC there was an expenses scandal there quite recently, yet I didn't see anyone suggesting that England or Wales should leave the UK because of it. Isn't this analogous to your claim that the UK should leave the EU because there are corrupt EU politicians?

&gt;If you've signed up to a treaty with someone and they fail to adhere to it I don't understand the rationale that says signing up to another treaty with them that binds you closer is a good thing.

Then don't sign just another treaty. Sign something that's actually binding, increase EU integration, do something proper, create an agency accountable to the whole Union and with actual responsibilities and goals.

I think it mainly derives from a perception that the EU's ultimate goal is to become a federal state and despite assurances to the contrary the British public perceive that the more you involve yourself in it the harder it will be to resist that ultimate outcome. I'm afraid the euro crisis has massively reinforced this point of view because it's now obvious that being inside the euro means it's impossible to resist this outcome.

So most of the anti-eu rhetoric, the criticism that so upsets everyone else in the EU is based around this issue, it's the British public, absolutely, categorically saying ""we will not enter into any kind of superstate, *and* we won't allow our politicians to maneuver us into a situation where we no longer have a choice.""

UK Politicians on the other hand and the CBI and those who are pro-EU simply scaremonger about the downsides of leaving the EU, actually I'm sure a lot of people who want to leave the EU are very aware of these, I don't think they believe it'll be easier, or that we'll even necessarily be better off outside, quite the opposite. But for them it's a price worth paying to once and for all rule out any possibility of the UK being sucked into an EU/Eurozone superstate.

The websites are vaughan.es (I think. Just google 'vaughan english spain' and I'm sure something will come up)

And Berlitz is bertlitz.es 

I don't know who has the won the contract yet. It won't be decided for a few months, but I'd check their websites around feb.

Also, a site called Madrid Teacher is good. They advertise jobs and what not.

As for the Visa business, I really have no idea. I'm English, so don't need a visa to work in Spain. 

I think that without a visa you can't get national insurance numbers/social security numbers, which mean that official jobs/companies can't pay you. Under the table pay of course is fine, but the programme I worked on is a Govt thing so they pay it into your bank!

I know a lot of Americans/Australians/South Africans have worked on the programme I did, so maybe the company can help you get  visa, but then again they might have had a passport from a European country.

As other people have said there are loads of ways to teach English. I think Jan and August/Sept are good times to go looking for work if you want to work for a school. I think some schools sponsor people for visas (but again, I don't really know much about that side)

Or you could do private classes/tutoring.

Basically, Spanish people really need to learn English, but a lot of them are struggling financially at the moment. If you can find wealthier people I'm sure you could charge them a lot more.

I think there are quite a few American programmes to be assistants in schools too.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;A company treating their workers as any other form of capital in an unregulated market would be quite successful, at least in the short run, and other companies would be forced to follow suit to keep cost down. Workers couldn't avoid such companies, because every one of them would have to do it to remain competitive. So, the state says you need to give each worker a certain amount of vacation days, you can't just fire them when they become pregnant, and you have to maintain a minimum standard of safety at the workplace, because that's what we as a society have decided to be beneficial for the whole. Since those rules apply to every company, the normal mechanism of the Free Market still works, and a race to the bottom is prevented.

You have to look at things from a broader perspective, there's no monopoly on labour demand just as there isn't one on labour supply, a race to the bottom is avoided the moment workers aren't willing to work (if it's not beneficial for them to work).

It's the same logic with the minimum wage, it's there but the vast majority are paid more than that; if a company doesn't provide the benefits you mentioned like safety in the workplace or paid holidays, then its workers will either demand more compensation or work elsewhere and the company would lose out on them, it's all about demand and supply, the government tinkering with this leads to inefficiency and unemployment.

The law also never apply to everyone, pardon my ad absurdum but the free market would collapse if you instated something like ""minimum wage: 10.000€/day"" or ""minimum 6 months of paid vacation/year"", even if it was a law made for every company.

You must not forget that there's always the informal economy which grows every time the government intervenes and creates a gap between the market optimal and the market post-regulation. That and the rest of the world, as you can't enforce these laws outside your borders - the maximum you can do is drive away some forms of labour, but it will still happen somewhere as long as it is profitable.",0,1356971117,null,0,false,0,c7oslaw,t3_15pc4h,t1_c7oslaw,t1_c7oqg1a,null,1430816884,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

KPN is a telecom provider active in both the Netherlands and Belgium. (and possibly more), it uses the name Base in Belgium though.

It's hard to compare it all, though due to different formulas.

Although it's pretty clear that paying 25€ for 2.5gb (NL) is more expensive than paying 15€ for 2gb (BE). That's not even mentioning that the max speed (only at the biggest formula) is 14mbps dl vs 42mbps dl in BE.

Unlimited calling and texts, costs 30€ in NL and 25€ in BE (also get 20mb data in BE).

That's just one telecom though, but I do think KPN is pretty popular in NL so it gives a nice insight on how the company delivers lower prices here.

The article is quite good despite the Google translation not being optimal.

Simply put, the Americans really need to balance their budget and can't continue to stack up their debt while delaying the underlining problem which is their deficits.

So far they aren't dealing with it, they've raised the debt ceiling and compromised on little, they aren't being capable of increasing revenue and/or cutting spending, and as much it might be bad for them if they reach no compromise till tomorrow, it would be much worse if they don't take the appropriate measures and continue to get into debt, that would be to continue blowing the bubble which is all fine and dandy till it bursts.

On a globalized world such as ours where our economies are so interdependent, this is also a very serious issue for Europe. The EU economy is the largest in the world, theirs is #2, it's no joke, just like the EU member-states are working hard to fix their government deficits, so has the USA to do the same, they just can't rely on the US dollar forever.",0,1356981386,null,0,false,0,c7ovfhf,t3_15qehj,t1_c7ovfhf,t3_15qehj,null,1430818208,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;Bullterrier, Pitbull-Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier und Staffordshire Bullterrier 

are listed as dangerous dogs without exception. That means you need a permit (costs ~320€), clean police record and insurance for the dog. Technically you need to claim a valid reason to hold a dangerous dog, but adopting from a shelter is sufficient. The dog needs to be neutered and chipped and is only allowed to walk in public with a leash and muzzle.

Taxes: A ""normal"" dog costs arround 90€/year but in order to minimize the amount of listed dog breeds living within city limits, the fee for a so called ""dangerous dogs"" is 600€!

I think it's a good idea to go to a local shelter after you have accoustomed to your new life and let them help you with all the questions. [The first shelter in Hamburg i found](http://www.hamburger-tierschutzverein.de/cms/index.php/tiervermittlung?page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=5)

true,alaninsitges,null,null,"All good advice. Speaking as an American who moved here 10 years ago with about two words of Spanish and mostly clueless about culture and customs, I'd say first off don't freak out, try not to be nervous, Catalans in general are gracious people and especially in Barcelona are used to foreigners so you'll get cut plenty of slack. 

The warnings about pickpockets are worth heeding but it's not as though the streets are teeming with them. Spanish law doesn't give the police lots of options for dealing with the thieves (who are NOT Catalan or Spanish btw, nearly all are illegal immigrants) so it is a problem. The flipside is that Barcelona is a very safe city - the crimes are petty, not violent. Be sure to keep your passport, etc., safely locked up when you go out and only bring what you need. And don't be wandering the streets alone and drunk. 

The smartest thing I ever did was invest in two weeks of intensive Spanish classes as soon as I arrived, mostly to figure out how the language worked. After that it was a matter of putting myself out there; I joined the castellers (Google it) in the small town where I live, made it a point to hang out in townie bars and avoid the temptation to hang out with the other expats too much. Once you have a feel for the basics of Spanish you can pick up a lot just talking with people, and your effort will be appreciated (I think one of the greatest arrogances is Americans who tell each other it's OK not to try because everyone loves to practice their English). I'm recommending Spanish over Catalan assuming you're only going to be here for a semester, and Spanish will be a lot more useful to you back in the US than Catalan will. 

If you like to read definitely pick up a copy of Barcelona by Robert Hughes. It's a very well-told version of the story of Catalunya and it will give you a deep appreciation of the history of the people and culture, and a great background on the events over the last 300 years that have led up to the drive for independence currently going on. You're going to be right in the middle of what is likely to be the birth of a new country, something that doesn't happen very often, and I think you'll appreciate understanding the reasons behind what's going on. 

A few other survival and sanity tips: 

- Plenty of American TV shows, although the audio is dubbed into Spanish (which is usually hilarious once you realize how many jokes went right over the tranlators' heads). They all have the original audio as well, you'll just have to muck around in the TV menu to find it. Usually it'll be labeled VO. Turn on the Spanish or Catalan subtitles and you'll improve your vocabulary without even trying. 

- Food here is amazing but not terribly varied. What we think of as ethnic food doesn't really exist, though there are a few decent Chinese/Thai/Indian places for when you're in the mood. Mosquito, Chen Ji, Bangkok Café, Pho, and the Dong Fang supermarket on Balmes are all worth a visit. Also you cannot get a decent burger in Barcelona, despite all the fake diner-looking places that are popping up around the city. Come to Sitges, about 20 minutes away by train, and we'll fix you up. :) 

- Movies are all dubbed as well, except in a couple of cinemas. Best bet is Yelmo Icaria, which has 15 screens showing new-ish films in their original language. Also: movies are CHEAP here!

- Yoigo is a mobile operator with decent prices and they have a really cheap option for calling overseas, like 2 cents a minute. 

All that said, I came to Barcelona on business 11 years ago and fell in love with the city, the people, and the culture. I'm still here, with no plans to live in the US again. It's a great place and once you get accustomed you'll love it.

true,missbenelli,null,null,"I don't know Riedlingen per se, but i grew up in the Ulm area so will post some general things to know - also about Baden-Württemberg, so much of this is valid for Tübingen and Reutlingen as well... wall of text, here we go.

One thing you need to be aware of is that in the area, most people will speak dialect. The dialect spoken (swabian/schwäbisch) is quite heavy and even some northern Germans won't understand it. Baden-Württemberg is notorious for this - they even made a campaign of the fact several years ago which advertised their versatility and went something like ""we master anything - except for high german"". 

So even if you learn German in a course, you will most probably still end up having difficulty understanding some people (but usually situations which result from that will be funny rather than terrible). Alternatively, you will end up speaking some kind of swabianized German which will sound cute and funny because it mixes with your original accent. However, most younger people speak english, at least a little bit, and generally you will manage to get by. People can sound grumpy in the region, but generally are more friendly and ready to help than they seem at first. Generally, Germans may seem a bit less open than e.g. Americans. Don't mistake this as hostility. We are just a tad more reserved, it's nothing personal. This applies for people in swabia even more than in many other regions. 

Another thing you should be aware of is that the area around Ulm can get really cold during winter, and Ulm itself can get very foggy at times. If you are prone to cold feet, SAD or both, be prepared. 

On a lighter note: the schwäbische Alb is nearby and it's really beautiful to take walks in the snow in the higher areas there. Lots of lovely landscape to be found nearby. http://www.schwaebischealb.de/  Great for hiking and rock-climbing, also great if you are interested in paleo-history (caves!and then some more caves!).

Swabian cuisine is not for everybody, but people tend to love the Maultaschen and Spätzle. Usually you will be able to also get turkish, greek and italian food even in midsized towns though. Also, McDonalds is common. Americans tend to like the beer in the region. Gold Ochsen is a local brew that is very drinkable. Try the christmas beer, too. 

If you like history, the wider area of Baden-Württemberg is quite interesting, too. Ulm (http://wikitravel.org/en/Ulm) has a cathedral with a very high church tower, and a nice old quarter called the Fischerviertel ( fishers' quarter) where you will find cozy cafes and pubs. It certainly isn't a brimming metropolis, but it has cinemas, theatres, and a little bit of everything from shopping places to subculture music clubs. Also they have fun and weird celebrations in summer which you will most probably enjoy. Ulm also isn't all that far from both Stuttgart (ca. 1 hour) and Munich (Bavaria, ca. 1,5-2 hours). An interesting weirdness is that ""New-Ulm"" (Neu Ulm) is just across the river Danube and you can walk over the bridge and -tadaaaa - find yourself in Bavaria. If you don't know the river Danube, it's one of the biggies in Europe and if you follow it, you get to interesting places until you end up in the black sea. 

Keep in mind that you can get very cheap flights into other European cities from Stuttgart, Rastatt and some other small airports which are relatively close - so while you are in the country, you can cheaply explore the continent and e.g. fly to the uk for very little money. There also is a TGV (high speed train) which i think leaves in Stuttgart and will take you to Paris in just a few hours. Think breakfast in Paris/romantic weekend getaway.

Also, i agree with what others said here, that you shouldn't worry much about safety. Of course general safety rules apply (like when in busy places, keep your money close to your body etc. to make life hard for pickpockets), but compared to American cities, south German cities are idyllic, crime rates are rather low and serious/violent crimes are rather rare.  

Finally, here are some stats about the Bundesland you'll be moving to http://www.statistik.baden-wuerttemberg.de/veroeffentl/Faltblatt/803811019.pdf hope this helps. 

tl;dr: Ulm/Swabia isn't so bad, because even though people will speak in weird dialect and you might end up having cold feet, there's spätzle and beer.

No need for taxation, so long as the system works fairly and people can keep their labour product.  As a wonderful socialist refrain puts it - give us back our commons and you can keep your poor relief!

&gt;and there's no private property 

Now you're getting warmer - this is an element of socialism, for sure.  (Private) property is theft - it doesn't mean I want to share your toothbrush (or your car or your house) though!  Property is also freedom, and that's why we need to ensure people have access to it, without access to property, there can be no liberty.

&gt;and all they produce goes to the state? 

Ah, you are mistaking me for a State socialist perhaps?  Don't you see my black flag?  I'm an anarchist.  There are (at least) two kinds of socialism.  To quote [Lesigne, per Tucker](http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm):

""One says:  
The land to the State.  
The mine to the State.  
The tool to the State.  
The product to the State.  
The other says:  
The land to the cultivator.  
The mine to the miner.  
The tool to the laborer.  
The product to the producer.  
There are only these two Socialisms.  
One is the infancy of Socialism; the other is its manhood.  
One is already the past; the other is the future.  
One will give place to the other.""  

&gt;You're deluding yourself if you think socialist states properly remunerate their workers, if anything, it's these very same states that most resemble slavery.

Well, I'm no fan of States, ""socialist"" or otherwise.  They're slightly more amenable to the people perhaps, but not much.  Some of them, to the extent they're democratic, are less evil, but mostly I want them gone.  Certainly communist States are oxymoronic - communism is supposedly Stateless, classless, moneyless socialism.

&gt;Capitalism = defending private property Free market = allowing people to trade said private property
&gt;
&gt;Again, how are these the anti-thesis of each other?

Capitalism is certainly private property, but a free market?  Not so much.  A market rigged by the State in favour of capitalists.  I would refer you to Adam Smith, who critiqued an early form of capitalism and bizarrely enough ended up as a capitalist icon despite them ignoring all his writings!  He would be horrified by today's corporate capitalism, and would despise the Adam Smith Institute established ostensibly in his name but propagating the very antithesis of his ideas.  Freed socialist markets are far closer to ""free markets"" than anything capitalists have ever come up with - the only free markets in the world today exist in developing world countries, and then only as one-way streets against their interests.

&gt;Hey, don't blame me, if you really care about them, you can engage in charity, there's absolutely nothing stopping you from letting two homeless sleep into your house and let them sleep in your couch or floor or wherever.

Here I'd refer you to [Oscar Wilde on charity and the kind slaver...](http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/wilde-oscar/soul-man/index.htm)

&gt;&gt;""Accordingly, with admirable, though misdirected intentions, they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see. But their remedies do not cure the disease: they merely prolong it. Indeed, their remedies are part of the disease.

&gt;&gt;They try to solve the problem of poverty, for instance, by keeping the poor alive; or, in the case of a very advanced school, by amusing the poor.

&gt;&gt;But this is not a solution: it is an aggravation of the difficulty. The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible. And the altruistic virtues have really prevented the carrying out of this aim. Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good; and at last we have had the spectacle of men who have really studied the problem and know the life – educated men who live in the East End – coming forward and imploring the community to restrain its altruistic impulses of charity, benevolence, and the like. They do so on the ground that such charity degrades and demoralises. They are perfectly right. Charity creates a multitude of sins.

&gt;&gt;There is also this to be said. It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property. It is both immoral and unfair.""

The solution is not to offer charity, but to end capitalism.

&gt;Oh, and I'm not a conservative.

My apologies. I have you RES tagged as one for some reason - it was obviously a false assumption, provide me an alternative and I'll gladly update it.

&gt;You're the one saying capitalism is inefficient and talking about the USA, if have no idea of how socialism is like then at least try to learn how it always goes wrong whenever people have tried to implement it, there's plenty of countries to read about and their experiences with socialism.

Most of the countries which've tried to implement socialism (to the extent socialism is possible at the national level) have taken a revolutionary or reformist Statist approach, and the vast majority have been un/underdeveloped countries, in many cases, basically peasant or feudal societies.  Even Marx recognised that industrial capitalism was a necessary precursor.  

But in fact, slave, capitalist, and communist modes of production are present in all countries today - there are communist businesses in Silicon Valley as we type, and self-employment without staff is compatible with socialism.  If you want to consider experiments in libertarian socialism on a larger scale, you need to be looking at times and places like civil war Catalonia and free Ukraine.

&gt;Absentee rights? What do you mean? That the factory one paid to build and the workers he continues to pay for them to work shouldn't benefit the investor because of the arbitrary criteria that he might not be inside the factory?

""one paid to build"", with wealth from where, generated by whom?  Everyone has a right to the fruits of their own labour, but not the labour of others.

&gt;Oh, even without a state, I'm sure one could enforce property rights, though it's much wiser to leave that to the state as they should be the only one with a monopoly on violence and who own the courts, the alternative would be anarchy.

Ta da!  And yes, you could enforce them with a private army, which would be warlordism or a patchwork of de facto private States, where each capitalist was an absolute dictator or monarch in their own domain.  But that would have to be enforced by brutish violence which was our original disagreement - private property necessitates violence.

&gt;People like you who want to turn the system upside down and to appropriate of the property of others, you're crazy, you'll just drive them away and kill all the incentives there is to invest if you got to decide and said that ""all the profits go to the state"", as I'm sure even you agree that nobody would be as willing to go trough all the trouble of starting a business and making it as profitable and efficiently run as possible if they got 0.001% of the returns as opposed to 100% or 80% or 50% depending on the tax rates.

I view the current system as upsidedown, I want to turn it the right way up.  And you keep on about this State thing which I oppose more strongly than you do.

&gt;But what about those who don't work? Will they not get paid? Dude, that sounds highly unfair!

Here there are two broadly socialist viewpoints - from each according to their ability and to each according to their effort, or from each according to their ability and to each according to their need.  The former is a market approach, the latter is a communist approach based on a gift economy.  I'm not a communist, I'm a market socialist, so I subscribe to the former, but in a world free from scarcity (which is not what we have now), I can see the attraction of the latter.  However, clearly capitalism is up to its neck in artificial scarcity, and a socialist freed market would eliminate this inefficiency so the actual required work per head would be significantly reduced.

&gt;If ""a person works, they get the full benefit"" is your alternative, then you're even more laissez-faire than I am, that would imply no taxes at all!

The way our infrastructure is set up makes it take *forever* to change things or make stuff happen. Just look at our court system--it takes at least 4 years for some cases (such as gay marriage) to be decided on. If some country invaded us, we would be defeated by the time we mobilized. It's ridiculous. 

And our congress has never been more polarized in history. The Democrats and Republicans hate eachother more than they love their country, and I'm not joking. Time and effort is *not* utilized to improve things, but rather, to weaken the opposing side. 

When you were a kid, did you ever exploit on the, ""If I can't have it, nobody can!"", tactic? Well that's what our government is doing--a ridiculous amount of politicians have openly said something along the lines of ""If I don't get what I want, this whole country is going to tumble into a ditch."" It's disgusting--our ""professional"" elected politicians are resorting to petty childish methods.

I'm extremely conservative myself, but in all honesty, our right-wing party, the Republicans, are to blame. 

The Republicans put their individual selfish priorities in front of the needs of the people. They're not afraid at all to sacrifice the common man's rights to enhance their luxuries. And their methods are downright evil--they're taking the country hostage, holding our citizens at gunpoint and demanding they get what they want, or else. But it turns out that the Republicans *have no clue* what they want. They always criticize Obama and the left, but have no suggestions. It's like the mother-in-law at the dinner table that keeps whining about the food, but she's too damn lazy to get off her ass and cook something better. 

So hypocritical they are--I don't even know what their core beliefs are anymore, outside of instant gratification, of course. They call themselves the party of financial responsibility and limited government, two standards I very much stand for, but they have no actions to prove it. They're only ""small"" government and state's ""rights"" when it meets their demands. For example, many state's-rights supporters refuse to acknowledge individual states' recognition of same-sex marriage or marijuana legalization, saying they both should be banned by current federal law.

People say that this country has moved to the right, but that's not true. This country hasn't stepped to the right, it's stepped backwards. We've given too much power to a small group of radical partisans. Our Founding Fathers and the politicians of old are rolling in their graves.

If we wish to improve thingss, we need to 1. eliminate this ""two-party"" system, (which is just really one bipolar conglomerate), 2. smooth down the system--make it fluid and dynamic.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm a Christian with an outlook some could describe as ""libertarian"". I believe that the Constitution should be obeyed and respected, so I'm a huge advocate of the seperation of church and state, as well as free speech and gun rights. I also believe in individual liberties--life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--so I support marriage equality, the right to life (unless it eclipses the health of the living mother), and decriminalization of victimless crimes, such as drug use and prostitution.

I also believe in limited government, which is a very controversial opinion to have. While I do think that business should be regulated less by the government, my main belief is that **corporations should have no place in government.**

It can only be one way or another. Business can be regulated and taxed by government, but if it must do so, it would need to be a part of the bureaucracy. Otherwise it would be taxation without representation. If business isn't regulated or taxed, in turn, it should be kept away from the government.

The church, the state, and the corporation should all be seperate entities, but should also have equal footing--the seperation of powers, much like how our government is divided into three equal parts.

But right now, unfortunately, we are living in a theocratic plutocracy. Although my Christian beliefs are extremely intertwined with the government, I condemn it, it is an unconstitutional practice, and one that is unfair to Jews, atheists, Buddhists, etc. I think the teaching of Creationism in public educational instutions is corrupt and immoral.

The average ~~conservative~~ constituent in general is not very educated when it comes to politics. They're easily influenced by the media (Fox News, tabloids), which shapes their opinions. I try to be as scientific and formulaic as possible when deciding my outlook on issues. However, this isn't the case for the massive majority, who choose sentiment and emotional appeal over the logistics.

I'm hoping to major in history and sociology, so I like to be well-read as much as possible. :P",0,1356996577,null,0,1356997728,0,c7ozc8b,t3_15qehj,t1_c7ozc8b,t1_c7oz6el,null,1430820106,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4
true,[deleted],null,null,"It's a *looong* story about why we live in a 2-party country. There's no laws that prevent 3rd parties from having power in government. In fact, there are several socialists, libertarians, etc. in power.

However, if there's one thing that Dems and Repubs hate more than eachother, it's the third parties. Our mass media corporations are owned by extremely partisan factions, which makes it nearly impossible for third parties to penetrate into the general public's knowledge.

For example, we have the infamous Presidential Debates. You want to know why there are only 2 podiums? The media loves to bend over backwards to keep third-party candidates from joining. Because **the less choices the public can choose from, the more polarized the public gets. And the more the public is engrossed in partisan politics, the more the media can exaggerate material to achieve maximum profit.**

All in all, the mass media is the most powerful political player in the US, and if they don't like the idea of something, it won't happen.

And I'm not the most educated person when it comes to government and politics. I've only been absorbed into the political sphere ever since I joined Reddit, which was only 15 months ago. There are a lot of people on the American political subreddits that will be happy to help, just avoid the circlejerky ones like /r/politics. and /r/conservative. There are far better smaller, consise subreddits--whether they're liberal, conservative, or neutral. :P
