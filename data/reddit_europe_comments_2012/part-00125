LATER however it was revealed by an official and independed commission that there was NOT enough mandate for such a war and it was a great blow for the christian democrat party. Just because the elected leaders make certain desicions does not mean it is the will of the people. Ofcourse democracy is never perfect but it is absolutely vital to hold a refendum when it comes to issues like this. If the people feel that they are not ready culturally, socially or in any way to be part of a larger union then their leaders must abide to that. Ofcourse there are arguments that support further intergration but letting our leaders just deceide what is best for the people even if they mean well it is called a 'technocracy'.

How?

Now, I live near munich. So I know culture, dialect, etc.
When I came into Augustiner Festzelt, it was all full.
So I stood there for about 3-4 minutes, until my gf picked up a drunken Canadian (only random that it was a Canadian, could have also been someone from USA, GB, Italy, Poland) who (and his buddies) let us sit at his table.

He was so drunk, he order beer after beer, Riesenbrezn, Radi, everything. Beer is 10€, food is also veery expensive. So we sat there and enjoyed while he and his buddies got so disgusting drunk while trying to pick up any woman who comes nearby. They didn't really know what they were doing, I think.
We offered them 60€ when we left, but they refused.
I think everyone of them left at least 300€ this evening.

Only to get drunk as fuck and have this ""one oh so special evening on the bavarian oktoberfest, which is soo nice and we had so much fun and everything was different to the normal drunk nights at home"".

Dude. Believe me. Don't get so fucking drunk. Don't buy food (except Riesenbrezn maybe).
3 - 4 Maß of beer (between 19 and 23:00, or around 1-1,5 Maß per hour) is enough to be drunk as shit. I never drank more, and I'm used to our beer. If you come early, also try to avoid to drink many more Maßen that 4. Maybe drink the first Maß slowly etc.

One Maß is around 10€. Riesenbrezn maybe 5€.
4 * 10€ Maß + 2 * 5€ Brezn + 2 * 5€ Schnaps (maybe) &lt; 100€.
Take 100€ with you. It's more than enough for a very nice evening.

The rest of your money: take it to all the other nice places in bavaria or munich. Please do it

Be polite, don't offend anyone, try to avoid drunken beating idiots (avoid trouble), be nice to bar staff, give tip around 10%, just don't be a stupid idiot.

Watch out that the bar staff (Bedienung in Dirndl) brings you FULL Maßkrüge (the beer glasses). They are often in such a hurry with refilling them at the bar, so that 50% or more is only foam.
Don't accept a beer with less than 2/3 of it really is beer, not foam (in this case, be polite, the bar staff will looked annoyed... just say ""I'm sorry, this beer is really a bit too less, can we get another one?"")

Don't buy the shit from the girls in dirndls which come through the benches. If you want a Brezn, ask the bar-staff (with beers). If you want a schnaps, get it at the side of the beer tent in the small booth where they sell it.

Don't smoke in the tents, it is NOT ALLOWED anymore since 2010. In 2010 you could still smoke without consequences, in 2011 some people were thrown out. This year it is expected to be more strict and more people will be thrown out.

If you are out of the tent after 20:30, you will never ever come in again. So many people are lining up, no chance. Also, if the security recognizes you, they won't let you in again, even if you are first in line.

If you have no reservation for a table, come early.

* Monday-Thursday: come between 14:00 and 15:00

* Friday,Saturday: come before 09:00  (yes)

* Sunday: come around 12:00

And: Have Fun!!

For me, and I think for al lot of people the only thing that stand between following narrowmindend and anarchistic/tribal instincts is a sense of loyalty trust and alieance with the people I can share a culture and a language with for hundreds of years.

For us working stiffs, though, we have to pay full price :-) the monthly subscription might be on a different page there (the LVB website is pretty crappy).

However Leipzig is an extremely bikeable city; it's very flat and not terribly spread out, so most of the time if you're wanting to live on the cheap you can get around by bike very easily.

On the whole, if you are looking to live cheaply in Germany, I would highly recommend Leipzig (or Berlin; I've heard in some parts of the city you can live very inexpensively)

Leipzig is a great mix of vibrant street cafe culture with a deep culture of music as well as a ton of really cool alternative projects due to the still large amount of empty buildings. For instance, in Lindenau (part of Leipzig) I know of several building owners who are philosophically opposed to charging rent so let people live rent-free if they renovate and maintain the building. Others offer free working space for artists and musicians.

There are also lots and lots of old warehouses and factories turned into coworking spaces, rock climbing gyms, 8-across indoor football fields, startup incubators, list goes on.

I'm sure these things exist elsewhere as well, but here there are so many opportunities due to the vacant buildings.

You initially stated that over 40% of rapes were committed by immigrants. You didn't cite your source but I'm inherently skeptical towards that kind of statistic. 40% of reported rapes? 40% of rape cases ending in conviction? There's too much room for bias for me to take that figure at face value.
We're discussing a group of people who can't conform and you feel they should be deported. How are going to find those people? Even you must admit that exporting foreigners that you merely think aren't conforming is a slippery slope. If you're talking about convicted criminals, they're already serving time, should pose no danger and are presumably being reformed and taken care of. And it's to late to deport them to avert their crime.
And another point. You say this is a cultural problem, some people can't conform, can't understand our most basic rules. Because they come from such a primitive culture. These people are too primitive to understand our laws. So they can't be helped and should be sent back. To me, if you suggest that someone breaks the law because he doesn't really understand the laws the logical thing is to explain the law in a way that person will understand. Consider the opposite situation. How should you treat a ""civilized westerner"" (Canadian? Irishman?) who understands our rules and breaks them anyway? Is he more or less dangerous?

Some Muslim immigrants admit their bias quite openly. An Islamic Mufti in Copenhagen sparked a political outcry after publicly declaring that women who refuse to wear headscarves are ""asking for rape."" Apparently, he's not the only one thinking this way. “It is not as wrong raping a Swedish girl as raping an Arab girl,” says Hamid. “The Swedish girl gets a lot of help afterwards, and she had probably fucked before, anyway. But the Arab girl will get problems with her family. For her, being raped is a source of shame. It is important that she retains her virginity until she marries.” It was no coincidence that it was a Swedish girl that was gang raped in Rissne – this becomes obvious from the discussion with Ali, Hamid, Abdallah and Richard. All four have disparaging views on Swedish girls, and think this attitude is common among young men with immigrant background. “It is far too easy to get a Swedish whore…… girl, I mean;” says Hamid, and laughs over his own choice of words. “Many immigrant boys have Swedish girlfriends when they are teenagers. But when they get married, they get a proper woman from their own culture who has never been with a boy. That’s what I am going to do. I don’t have too much respect for Swedish girls. I guess you can say they get fucked to pieces.

""The Whore Lived Like a German""

In the past four months, six Muslim women living in Berlin have been brutally murdered by family members. Their crime? Trying to break free and live Western lifestyles. Within their communities, the killers are revered as heroes for preserving their family dignity. How can such a horrific and shockingly archaic practice be flourishing in the heart of Europe? The deaths have sparked momentary outrage, but will they change the grim reality for Muslim women?

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/30/honour-killings-jury-afghan-family

A jury in Canada has found three members of an Afghan family guilty of drowning three teenage sisters and another woman in what the judge described as ""cold-blooded, shameful murders"" resulting from a ""twisted concept of honour"". The verdicts concludes a case that shocked Canadians.

Prosecutors said the defendants killed the three teenage sisters because they felt they had dishonored the family by defying its strict rules on dress, dating, socializing and using the internet.

""Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5 to a high of 0.9. A 1996 statement by the American Psychological Association gave about .45 for children and about .75 during and after adolescence. A 2004 meta-analysis of reports in Current Directions in Psychological Science gave an overall estimate of around .85 for 18-year-olds and older. The New York Times Magazine has listed about three quarters as a figure held by the majority of studies.""

* What does ""underage"" mean?  The mention of pedophilia makes it sound like they're 8 or 10, but then you mention teens (which, I guess, starts at 13).  Well, the age of consent varies from country to country in Europe (in fact, it also varies from state to state in the US): I think it's 13 in Spain, 14 in Germany and Italy, 15 in France, 16 in the UK, 17 in Ireland.  (I'm well aware that you're not considering having sex with your students, I'm just giving these as ballpark values for what various countries might consider as ""grown up"" at least to the point that pedophilia wouldn't be a plausible accusation.  In fact, if we were to discuss the legal ramifications, sex with a *student* might not be OK even if they're above the age of consent but under 18, and conversely even if they are underage sex with a minor often in Europe does not fall under a ""statutory rape"" infringement but a different legal qualification.)

&gt;Third. It feels like transparency and democracy is disappearing every year.

Did you even watch the vid? This would also be improved and as of now it doesn't help that there aren't many people actually voting in the EU. Also the next EU president will actually be voted by said parliament.

What you say about transparency is something i'm kinda confused by too. What part isn't transparent enough for you? You can watch the discussions at the parliament and the like on a live-stream over at EP TV and there are many other sites and sources to get info that is easily accessible to the public.

&gt;Southern Europe has a track record of voting for, lets say ""interesting characters that promise short term gain over long term stable finances""....

I agree with the somewhat crazy voting in the east (and south) but do then don't nag about not enough democracy in the EU unless you have a better proposal of your own on how to elect EP's and the like.

&gt;More power to someone other than Swede's. Why?

Overall less spending by for example a centralized army was something proposed and almost came true not that long after world war 2. This however also applies to different government institutions nowadays that could be combined for better results and less spending. (This fcourse for decisions and research that isn't research specific. There are shittons of advantages. Many of my class could do their internship this year in a foreign EU country with help from an EU institution which was a great experience.

This is about centralization within a increasingly globalized world. And conservatism isn't gonna help.

true,Asyx,NRHW,"North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","Well, are there other countries where the underground is called metro in Europe? I just suppose you're in France now.

The French are pretty open minded about that as far as I've seen. I have family in Paris and while we would here in Germany keep a distance to people we don't know at first, the friends of my family I've never seen in my life started the whole ""kiss left; kiss right"" thing. Very uncomfortable as a German since we are pretty cold when we meat people the first time.

So... As a teacher I'd say that it is weird because you're clearly some kind of authority and you should keep a professional distance. Although, you're 20 and it is impossible in Germany to be a teacher with 20 so I've got no idea how old your students are and how it is to have a teacher less than 10 years older than me.

If your students are over 16, it shouldn't be a problem (I wouldn't want to hang out with 16 years old in general but some people are probably mentally older). Here in Germany, teacher started to ""siezen"" (that's the polite form of addressing in German) you in 11th grade (that's around 16) and put themselves more equal towards you and with a lot more respect instead of the usual teacher - student relation.

Well, there shouldn't be a problem legally. In Germany, sex with a 14 years old is legal under normal circumstances and if one person is a authority personality, the minimum age for sex is 16. I highly doubt that a normal friendly relationship will get you in any trouble in France or any other European country.

When I say Brussels, I mean the EU, not the Belgian people. However, are you saying that the EU is doing a better job of handling money than the Swedish government? Is the EU more effective in your mind? Bigger is not always more effective, compare UK to Finland, US to Switzerland etc, so I do not see why they should be, automatically.

&gt;Did you even watch the vid? This would also be improved and as of now it doesn't help that there aren't many people actually voting in the EU. Also the next EU president will actually be voted by said parliament.


&gt;What you say about transparency is something i'm kinda confused by too. What part isn't transparent enough for you? You can watch the discussions at the parliament and the like on a live-stream over at EP TV and there are many other sites and sources to get info that is easily accessible to the public.

Everything. In Sweden basically *all* papers, unless they are a police investigation, including notes from meetings etc (obviously, state, not companies) are public. How are the deciscions made in the EU? Can we get every paper in the EU to be public?  We are number 5 on the Transparency Internationals list, almost every country in the EU apart from Finland and Denmark are lower on the list. Do you think we will now *more* about how the descicions are made in the EU in a federation, than we currently know how they are made in Sweden?  Do you think the Eastern European MP's that will vote for where my money will go, will be less corrupt than a member of the Swedish parlament? I don't think so, honestly.  

If that is so, then  I'd  like a complete transparency with regards to the all the government that need bailout *exactly* how much they need (we all know Spain need more), and how the decisions are being made, there is far to much going on behind closed doors.  Oh, and I'd also like all the politicians, in the whole of the EU to publish all their income and tax records, for a start. Can you  convince me that Sweden is going to be more transparent by joining a federation? 

&gt;I agree with the somewhat crazy voting in the east (and south) but do then don't nag about not enough democracy in the EU unless you have a better proposal of your own on how to elect EP's and the like.

I don't, although I wish I had, but that is why I do not want to be in a federation with them. I wish I knew how to fix it

&gt;Overall less spending by for example a centralized army was something proposed and almost came true not that long after world war 2. This however also applies to different government institutions nowadays that could be combined for better results and less spending. (This fcourse for decisions and research that isn't research specific. There are shittons of advantages. Many of my class could do their internship this year in a foreign EU country with help from an EU institution which was a great experience. As much as you might dislike it globalization is a thing and we'r up against giants like China and the US. This isn't about giving power away. This is about centralization within a increasingly globalized world. And conservatism isn't gonna help.

Yes, it is. When someone else for example decides where *our* money goes, it is taking power away. I don't believe a Swedish MP is as likely to send it to southern Italy, as and Italian MP for example. And, remember, they outnumber us (and southern Italy is corrupt). I noticed that you didn't refer to the permanent transfer, but are you saying they will decrease?  So, do you think, Sweden as a country, who are a net payer, will *receive* money, like Portugal for example, or do you think the EU will take more,( like they want to now - the EU want to increase the budget, but we are not getting more money back. Where is our money going, because we are not getting them back, that is for sure? ). 

As with the China part - Sweden trade more with China than most of southern Europe, because we built up competitivness. If we want to stay that way, it doesn't help being responsible for to countries who are very slow to reform and continously votes for no reforms and corrupt people. They have to change. We can't ""wait"" for that, the race is on - now.  And, maybe it's better for us to work with Canada instead (remember, it's so global now) than with Greece, Canada is more stable.Personally, I don't mind Greece, but Canada has more to give, right now.


&gt;Can you point out some stuff that outweighs the good points on that track?

Seriously, where do you want me to start. We can start with the fact that some economies have received aid for almost 30 years now and they are still on the receiving end, and will be for, well, forever I suppose. The transfers are permanent, and I believe our money has been squandered. I do not want that anymore.

Far to much of the EU's budget is going towards agriculture, due to the influence of French farmers.

Well, let's just say the blatant disregard almost all the Eurozone countries have for laws rules and regulations. Almost none of them are following the treaties and the laws they themselves (including Belgium) signed up for, and that is one of the many reasons the Eurozone are in this mess. Are they taking reponsibility and starting to follow them? No, they even manage to break them even more. It's like they are pretending they do not exist. What is the next law that they are going to break, I find this so scary that no once cares. 

I do not want to be in any sort deep cooperation, nor do I want to hand over any kind of power to countries like that. It is dangerous, how on earth can they be trusted?. 

I like Belgium too, but I'd rather not be in any federation. Your point a about a global world is right though, and I'd like a Nordic one.

Here,  one say Stockholm (for example) is a rich area, but northern Sweden for example (where the people are poorer) have forests, mines etc, so it is not I don't know who contibutes most. 

However, Sweden is divided to roughly 250 small communes, and it used to be a great fight when the rich ones had to support the poor ones, since the taxes are supposed to go to the commune, and not to anyone else. That could be within the area of Stockholm though, so it was more of a rich/poor discussion than geografical. So no, transfers are not discussed in that way.

 Also, apart from jokes, we don't have any regions wanting out really, I don't think any of the Nordic countries have that to the extent we see on the continent. I mean, Belgium as a country is young (even though your regions are of course, old), and people might still identify more as  Wallon, than Belgian, due to a lot of reasons that I probably do not know enough about. 

 If you look at Nordic history, we did invade and took our countries, but apart from areas of southern Sweden, who were rather Danish, we were always one people in each country, sort of. Denmark had Norway, we had Finland, they were still Norweigan and Finns, both we and them knew that.So, from my countries perspective, I don't really ""get it"".

Think about it this way. I am sure that you within your country have financial transfers towards the less fortunate.

What do most people say when they are told that they have to pay more taxes, so that people living on welfare can get bigger apartments, more money, less stress.  You are obviously also going to subsidise their loans, since they can't pay them off, etc. Is everyone in your country happy about that? Do you think it is a good idea subsidising people forever, even if they are perfectly smart, capable healthy? Even though you know you have paid for the same people the since you started to pay taxes?  Would everyone like that? 

Greece have been on the receiving end since they joined the EU, same with Portugal, Ireland and Spain. Ireland has a higher GDP than some countries that contributes, not to mention Spain, Greece etc. Also, if they have been on the receiving end of money to develop competitivness, why haven't they developed it then? I hate seeing money go to waste. Also, I know they don't even vote for people who will take care of the money. And then, pay more? It is financial madness, and I think it aids the corrupt system. Also, taking about competetivness, those money might be better spent in China, or on research. Or, in fact, on Eastern Europe. Compare Poland and Estonias development to southern Italys.

true,grlira,null,null,"&gt; First of all, you have a wrong mission statement. The aim is not to full-fill agreement with Troika, the aim is to get back on market, and the only to do that is to convince the market that Portugal has solved most of its structural problems and has returned to a steady growth back.

Sorry but ""the market"" is controlled by the rating agencies *et al* who have been consistently targeting weaker countries (Greece and Portugal, now Italy and Spain) by lowering ratings, thus increasing interest on loans and, essentially, contributing (if not leading) to the current crisis. There is nothing we can do to get back on the market and get good credit reputation while we are held under the water by a system which is supported by the states themselves.

Anyway, assuming the above is false and there is indeed something that can be done

&gt; * Tear down labour laws, when you make firing easy you make hiring easier.

Nobody wants to hire right now, so if you make firing easier, you're increasing unemployment, thus increasing pressure on the already very fragile social security system, while also reducing purchasing power and slowing the economy further.
Portugal needs stability. People need to not be worried about whether they'll be able to afford food and electricity next month, so they can spend more and re-start the economy.
Besides, as someone has mentioned already, you clearly don't know Portuguese employers. Some, if not most, would use a more liberal system to abuse and 'enslave' employees.

&gt; * Tear down bureaucracy, starting a new joint stock company shouldn't take more than two days, and operating one should be as easy as possible.

I couldn't agree more here. We need to do away with the red tape and the associated unnecessary spending. Again, make businesses and production easier, increase employment, etc.

&gt; * Put more money on bringing foreign direct investment into the country, and give more support for export companies to expand in the continent and oversees.

Sorry, what money? We're broke. As for stimulating exports, absolutely.

&gt; * Raise consumption taxes, target for example import/sale of non-essential items such as cars with 50% or 100% car tax.
&gt; * Raise energy taxes, target fossil fuel based energy as those are all imports.

We're already being taxed seven ways to Sunday. Raising taxes at this point will slow down consumption, yes, but while non-essentials can be done away with, we just can't have people choosing to not have heating so they can eat, or not have electricity because they can't afford it.

And because just criticising other's ideas is not constructive here are some of my own:

* Raise taxes for the truly rich and lower them for the middle and low class.
* Fix the judicial system and weed off all of the corrupt managers/politicians/ex-politicians with obscene incomes. Inject the money saved from not paying them as stimulus packages.
* Add incentive to production and exports.
* Take unemployed people and offer them to either work in production, sponsored by the state, or lose their unemployment benefits.
* Go back to a production economy. For too long, Portugal has been, mostly, a service provider. We need to 1) Produce enough to literally feed the population, thus lowering imports and 2) Invest on cutting-edge R&amp;D to produce high quality products.
Note: Why not invest on traditional productions like textile? Because the east has us beaten there. We just can't compete with that cheap a labour.

The history of the US is different from that of Europe. And I think that's why there's so much blowback to this idea. US states weren't just a bunch of individual countries that decided to come together at some point. Most states were created from larger territories. To become a state you *had* to join the Union. There was no option to not do so. Additionally, the people in these territories were American anyway (immigrants aside). It was Americans creating these new states within America.

Sure, the cultures and economic conditions are different. It's a big country. There are definitely states I'm not a fan of, and vice versa. But at the end of the day, we're *all* Americans. I'm not a Missourian first, American second. It's the opposite. And it's been like that for most of our history.

First off, it doesn't matter whether or not the Saud's only sell their oil to us, oil has to be refined, and the only country in the world able to refine all that oil is Texas. That is also why oil is cheaper in the US compared to the rest of the developed world- we *turn* groundshit *into* carshit.

Also, at the expense of the rest of the world? That doesn't make any sense. Since the 80s, literally billions of people have been consuming more and more. Not only in China and India, but in South America and Africa and the Middle East (except for Iran and Iraq, where they went full scale WW1 on each other). 


Furthermore, ""QE to infinity"" is rather benign: We're in a fucking recession. Ask any *real* economists, and they'll be saying, ""Yeah, the best thing the Fed can do right now is raise inflation expectations."" Why raise inflation expectations? To make people spend more now, help deleveraging of debt, and to stop from becoming fucking Ireland. Of course, the Fed didn't actually say that, but it is sort of implicit.

There are actions a teacher can do which are legal and acceptable to non teachers, but will be frowned upon by your fellow teachers, and this could lead you to loose your job.

For instance, engaging romantic relations with one of your students will be considered by as abusing your position as a teacher. A teacher has a position of power and should strive to be someone the students can trust. While a romantic relation doesn't necessarily breach this position, it will generally still be considered as very problematic. Imagine teaching a class from which one of the students is your known lover. More importantly, you could really risk loosing your job.

Going out with students, or simply enjoying their company will be acceptable to almost all teachers. However, some of the more traditional teachers (more so in catholic schools for example) will also view this as going 'too far'. But these outdated modes of thought are being replaced. In some countries/schools it will even be seen as a positive. You should try to find out how your fellow teachers, but especially the school principal see this.

All this says nothing about your private life. If you can keep the two firmly separated, there shouldn't be a problem. Of course, having a romantic relation with a big age difference, for example a 24 year old with a 16 year old, will still be frowned upon by many people, how sincere your motives might be. When this comes out it can still be viewed as irreconcilable with your position as teacher, even though this happened outside your function.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Sorry but ""the market"" is controlled by the rating agencies et al who have been consistently targeting weaker countries (Greece and Portugal, now Italy and Spain) by lowering ratings, thus increasing interest on loans and, essentially, contributing (if not leading) to the current crisis. There is nothing we can do to get back on the market and get good credit reputation while we are held under the water by a system which is supported by the states themselves.

Credit rating agencies only reflect the general market opinion and add their own validation to it. Not to mention that many big actors in the market don't use credit rating agencies, but instead use their own tools to make assessments. With GIIPS countries the reality is that some of them haven't had stable growth for ages, some have too much debt, most have too rigid system, most have pensions bombs, some have problems facing increased global competition.

I wouldn't in a million years, but my money on GIIPS bonds, stocks could different, but there are many other markets that stronger outlooks.

Sorry, markets have made the right judgement and this judgement holds as long as things don't radically change.

&gt;  Nobody wants to hire right now, so if you make firing easier, you're increasing unemployment, thus increasing pressure on the already very fragile social security system, while also reducing purchasing power and slowing the economy further. Portugal needs stability. People need to not be worried about whether they'll be able to afford food and electricity next month, so they can spend more and re-start the economy. Besides, as someone has mentioned already, you clearly don't know Portuguese employers. Some, if not most, would use a more liberal system to abuse and 'enslave' employees.

If you have employees in your payroll that don't contribute enough, or even worse, are in a way of making the firm run better, then you need to get rid of those people. While you are right that state has to pay more unemployment benefits, on the other hands firms become more efficient and profitable, that will allow them to re-invest, but also return more money to shareholders, that will also benefit the state with increased taxes. That is the only way to generate growth.

Increasing consumer confidence and spending doesn't work in Portugal because the balance of payments in 2010 was -10% of GDP. At this point increased spending would add to balance of payments problem and cause the economy to take even deeper downturn eventually.

In case of employers taking advantage of the opportunity, well, that is the market reality, in good times it is the employees who have the upper hand and in downturns it is the employers. Not to mention that employers who don't treat right their valuable employees right, will see them leaving the company, causing costs and losses to the employer.

&gt; Sorry, what money? We're broke. As for stimulating exports, absolutely.

There is always money, what the state needs to do is to cut from somewhere and spend it elsewhere. It could be as easy as cutting down foreign ministry and embassies and moving money from it to investment and export orientated organization.

&gt; We're already being taxed seven ways to Sunday. Raising taxes at this point will slow down consumption, yes, but while non-essentials can be done away with, we just can't have people choosing to not have heating so they can eat, or not have electricity because they can't afford it.

If things don't become better then this is the reality that people will face. Actually people in countries that rely mostly on burning fossil fuels will face this problem. The only solution out of it is to invest into other energy forms such as nuclear and hydro.

&gt; Raise taxes for the truly rich and lower them for the middle and low class.

Truly rich have means to dodge any additional taxes. I don't know about taxation in Portugal, but I would bet that taxation should be developed the other way. Lower taxes for the rich and raise taxes of middle and lower income earners. Why? Because with lower taxes there is less need to dodge taxes, and many people may choose to honestly report their incomes than try to get rid of their obligations.

Not to mention that you need rich people to act as investors, venture capitalists, angel investors, etc... People who have earned their fortunes by themselves have the ability to select good investments, they put their money on places that will generate more success and more growth. If you don't allow accumulation of wealth, then you will have less investments, less new ventures, less start-ups, etc...

&gt; Take unemployed people and offer them to either work in production, sponsored by the state, or lose their unemployment benefits.

That will only increase inefficiencies. Either a company has a real need for an employee or they don't, either they make enough money or they don't. Systems like these will only make firms and people lazier. To succeed in global markets firms and employees must be more quicker, more flexible, more capable, etc...

&gt; Go back to a production economy. For too long, Portugal has been, mostly, a service provider. We need to 1) Produce enough to literally feed the population, thus lowering imports and 2) Invest on cutting-edge R&amp;D to produce high quality products. Note: Why not invest on traditional productions like textile? Because the east has us beaten there. We just can't compete with that cheap a labour.

That should be left to market. What the state can do is to try to identify firm and industry clusters and then work with them on how to support their activities. For example tailor higher education based on market analysis, if there is need for example type A engineers, then resources should be put there, and cut for example from studies that industries don't need.

true,Sulphur32,FRAN,Franglais,"&gt;British defence chiefs have always been privately in favour of developing a joint European army, navy and air force

What? So Will Hutton, a man who is best known for writing opinion columns on economic matters (opposing cuts and in favour of increased banking regulation) can just write something like that without any sourcing whatsoever? That's a very bold claim to make in such an offhand manner, for someone who has shown no insider knowledge of the military before.

&gt;The future allegedly lies in China, despite the fact that a Chinese Spring – and associated turmoil – is drawing closer.

I guess Hutton has a crystal ball, or maybe some Gypsy magic, he seems to be able to predict the future with absolute certainty. It's possible that China might see some revolts against Communist Party rule, but to state that like its some kind of inevitability is stupid.

Many European countries have shown time and time again that they are unwilling to make a serious commitment to both their own defence and that of Europe while the USA, France and the UK guarantee it for them[^1](http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7&amp;plckPostId=Blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post:3746e462-d9f3-43bd-90d2-769ec8209630). They're perfectly happy to make token contributions to joint operations such as those in Libya and Afghanistan while the logistical and intelligence aspects are taken care of for them, but I've yet to see any evidence that a joint European force would lead to a situation other than France and the UK carrying a disproportionate share of costs and any combat casualties[^2](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/11/13/1258112710564/Info-is-beautiful-08-001.jpg). The difficulties of integrating so many different forces, with different languages and operating cultures, would at least in the medium term provide more problems than it would solve.

Both France[^3](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/ivory-coast-strongman-arrested-after-french-forces-intervene/2011/04/11/AFOBaeKD_story.html) and the UK[^4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Palliser) have shown in the past that they are able to take action to secure their interests, albeit in a limited fashion. I don't disagree with Hutton that defence cuts will reduce this capability, but I don't see how they are so crippling that the two nations will be utterly unable to do so in the future. This downgrade might even be a positive thing, reducing the temptation to engage in disastrous adventurism like the Iraq war. 

I especially don't understand how combining resources with countries who have next to no ability (or desire, in fact) to project power would solve this issue. A lot of federal Europe/ combined EU military proponents seem to have a desire for their country and the EU itself to punch above its weight, competing on equal terms with the USA and China. But France and the UK already punch above their weight, and recognise that attempting to compete with the USA and China on their own terms is a futile exercise. We neither want nor feel the need to match these two nations, whose economies are vastly larger than our own, blow for blow. That sort of mentality would harm, not help Europe.

These meetings can be as often as you think you can still maintain a professional relationship with them, but it is important to say that always the whole class is invited and you do not just meet a few people you have decided upon, which would seem like you are favoring them.
Also these meeting were at max 2 or 3 times for every class, so once per year would be usual.

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"&gt;Depends on what you consider strategic interests. The other NATO members, as well as other international partners, are quite displeased with Germany's performance recently in the NATO and UN exactly because of its reluctance to actually use its military. If you consider international influence and foreign policy clout as desirable, you could very well argue that it was in Germany's strategic interest to take part in the Libya campaign, even if Libya itself was of less importance to it.

This are diplomatic considerations to me. I was talking about ressources, national security or geographic reasons important for international trade/military vantage points.

&gt;That is definitely a point. But consider this: one point of a unified military is that not all countries need to hold on to all military capabilities. Rather, some countries would provide vital capabilities A, while others would take care of capabilities B. This means that, in order to conduct a successful military operation, a larger amount of countries has to agree on the importance of said proposed operation to serve their interests (whichever they may be). This is already done in part, look for example at the Dutch who will abandon all their tank forces, relying on Germany and others to defend it in the event of a land war in Europe (which is very unlikely to begin with). That also means that, in order to have sufficient tanks ready for a military campaign, Germany would need to be on board. This could turn out very ugly when one country is black-mailing all the others with its veto, but it can also lead to more consensus-finding efforts in which more opinions and perspectives are involved in the initial decision-making process. Necessity could breed cooperation and integration because no one is able to go to war alone anymore.

Good, but if we adopt such a system, how is this different to NATO? In your proposal, we would then have rationalised militaries (which I think are good), intertwined command structures but ultimately, you would again give the ultimate command to the several nations involved, rather than one central institution.

Isn't this exactly what NATO is? Where's the benefits of a unified military in terms of easy deployment if you do not take out the national factor?

I admit I have lost with whom I argued about which specialities, but I argued with one person about how a unified military would make it easier to answer an external threat (that was the argument presented against me). This would then make this argument redundant, as you couldn't answer in quicker than with NATO if you do not have a central decision making body.

&gt;Do you say that for political or military-strategic reasons? From a military perspective (and I'm no expert on specific military strategy), I think it was quite successful. The objective was reached (Gadhafi is gone), no European soldier died and it was relatively short. The political reasons for starting the campaign in the first place are debatable.

true,suspiciously_calm,null,null,"When was the last time the EU (or its constituent countries) needed an army to defend its home territory?

Right, before the EU even existed.

Nowadays, there are other, economically more viable ways to ensure homeland security than a military. If the loss of trade relations is more costly to a foreign power than the value of potential loot from an invasion, they won't attack. It's game theory.

The EU (and its member states) should ditch their military and use the funds where they're needed.

Edit: To the pro-military circlejerk that sprung from this comment:

A strong military, as a deterrent, works by providing disincentives for potential invaders to actually attack. This is no different than any other disincentive, such as the presence of trade relations. The point here is that a military is *extremely* expensive to maintain while trade relations basically pay for themselves.

On the other hand, in case of an attack, it's gonna be messy either way, army or no army. It's a scenario that you want to avoid like the plague anyway, so there's no point in investing huge amounts of money in a scenario that should never happen.

And, in fact, the cold war shows that relevant actors on the world stage *do* act rationally (enough). Even as it is today, the only EU countries with half a decent military are the UK and France, but still no match for America's. Why does America not attack Europe, even with nutjobs like Dubya at the helm? Because it would shitcan its economy. Same goes for China. The most profitable move, in monetary terms as well as in terms of homeland security, is to maintain and extend such a position in the world economy so as to provide no incentives, to anyone, to attack you.

And after all, playing your cards as best as possible is the only thing you can do. There's no such thing as absolute security, and a military certainly doesn't provide it. The danger of a government using the military against its own people is just as real as that of an outside invasion, and arguably, far more likely (not least, because it actually *is,* or *can be,* a favorable move for its leaders to do so).",0,1347798750,null,0,1347813625,0,c68wlcn,t3_zyt4t,t1_c68wlcn,t3_zyt4t,null,1429911730,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Generally, you'll have a very easy time transferring your license in most states. You didn't mention whether you already had a license? 

If you don't have a license already, you'd need to take a written exam to get a learner's license, and then have someone teach you how to drive and hold the learner's license for 3-6 months, during which time you can only drive if a qualified driver is in the car with you. 

Then you can take a road test and get your actual license. Some cities and jurisdictions are vastly easier to get a license in than others, so do your research on that. I got my license in my college town after 3 attempts, but my girlfriend was having no luck until we heard that the test in another city was much easier. At the new place, she passed first time. Mostly because they only asked her to parallel park, no reverse park abilities needed. :) 

Once you have a license from one of the states that has a reciprocal agreement with Germany, you can get your German DL.

The federation has a responsibility to secure what used to be called the Four Freedoms: free movement of goods, capital, services, and people -- and the basic human rights of the individual -- it's not right that when the federation doesn't have power, it's up to the state, it might just be up to the most subsidiary government of them all -- one person. 

It would also have to protect the federation from foreign and domestic threats, although that could be more a matter of organisation, not necessarily execution. Maybe also some interstate infrastructure (roads, rail, air, energy, banking) to secure the freedoms mentioned above, again perhaps limited to regulation and organisation. They would also have to be responsible to secure the demands put on countries that want to join the Union. It's all about solving things at the right level. Toxic waste in Germany is a German problem. CO2 emissions which harm us all is a Federal one.

The states themselves can deal with other things: Education, healthcare, welfare, transport infrastructure, whatever they do today, and would have to organise their local democracy however they wish.

- [Appartements](http://www.immobilienscout24.de/Suche/S-/Wohnung-Miete/Bayern/Muenchen?enteredFrom=result_list)

The last site is in German only I'm afraid, but you should be able to navigate it roughly. In the upper left you can enter filter criteria. Zimmer means rooms (bath and kitchen don't count), Wohnfläche is the size in square meters and Kaltmiete is the rent without water and power.

There really aren't Ghetto-Areas in Munich, but the not-so-nice-neighborhoods you might want to avoid are Hasenbergl, Am Hart, Perlach.

Very nice areas in the center with usually good public transport and flair I would recommend are: Altstadt, Au, Haidhausen, Lehel, Ludwigsvorstadt/Isarvorstadt, Maxvorstadt, Neuhausen, Nymphenburg, Schwabing, Schwanthalerhöhe.

Just a word about the rental market in Munich though: It can be annoying.   Most of the times you have to pay an agent fee (2-3 monthly rents) and a deposit (3 rents, you get that back when you move out). There are lots of people competing for nice appartements, so you usually have to meet the agent, take a look at the place, fill out some very stupid forms about yourself (how much money you earn, what job you have and if you play musical instruments ... seriously) - and then basically hope for the best. It can be a very stupid competition. Just take it easy, don't focus on one particular object too much and plan some time for finding a nice place. Once you sign the papers, all is very nice here. ;-)",0,1347802560,null,0,false,0,c68x0sf,t3_zyw7n,t1_c68x0sf,t1_c68wu8a,null,1429911932,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

&gt;The worst case Führeschein scenario is having to take a full driving course, like young German drivers do. ""To get a regular driver's license,"" Christine explains, ""you have to take **14 theory classes and at least 12 driving lessons**. Driving schools usually offer them twice a week, so that takes about seven weeks. Depending on how quickly you learn, it can be done in about three months; but it usually takes longer, because of holidays and so forth. You start with the classroom sessions, and then move on to the driving portion, taking them in parallel so you learn the rules and also how to apply them."" How many driving lessons you'll need to take depends on how quickly you learn. With 12 as the minimum, and 50 on the high end, the full licensing course can cost between **EUR 1000-2000**.

Each of the theory lessons is supposed to be 90minutes and the driving lessons are usually 45min.

When you do your theoretical test the questions are weighed. A wrongly answered questions gives you 2,3,4 or 5 points. You can rack up up to 10 pts and still pass unless you get 2 5pts questions wrong.

When you do your practical test the following actions will end the test immediately:

Ignoring a red light

Ignoring or failing to understand the directions of a policeman directing traffic

Going down a one-way street the wrong way

Ignoring someone elses right of way

Any kind of endangerment of other traffic participants

Ignoring any signs that may prohibit you from entering a street

Overlooking another traffic participant in your blindspot

Failing to use the mirrors, look over your shoulder or anything of the like when performing maneuvres

Speeding up while being overtaken

Ignoring a no passing sign

Turning where prohibited

Passing over a solid line

Tailgating

This is just another case where the media invoke myths, half-truths, and stereotypes, without helping the international audience to understand what's at stake.

The extension has nothing to do with Greece stopping repayments, or receiving another loan. Creditors did not lose a single eurocent until now, but they make a decent profit (while Greek insurance funds are on the brink of collapse, because Germany had the brilliant idea of forcing private creditors to take a haircut on Greek bonds; since then, Merkel tells everyone that she regrets that decision). The extension is about softening  the austerity measures in the country. Greece lost a quarter of its GDP, because the program targets are impossible to meet, for any country. It's in the interest of Greece's creditors to grant the extension. It's not in their interest to see Greece losing more of its GDP, because some bureaucrats cannot admit that their methods do not have the results they thought they would in the real world.

Meaning one could try and argue that it was genocide. One can not, or, rather one can but one would be an idiot and certain to fail. Nothing carried out in Iraq demonstrates a systematic attempt by the US military to exterminate the Iraqi people. Not even close.

&gt;though our actions in the Middle East have most certainly led to the mass killings of people of a certain ethnic background, namely, the 100,000+ people who have been killed in Iraq following the US invasion.

So you'd like to accuse Iraqi militias of genocide? You'd have more luck, although I fear you'd still be wrong.

Corrupted politicians wasting money that the EU has given, big companies avoiding to pay taxes, higher officials and doctors receiving bribes, these are some serious cases of corruption - by the way one of the bigger scandals in Greece involves Siemens, a German multinational company. 

Now, people of middle and lower class trying to avoid, for example, to give a receipt in their shop to avoid paying some taxes to a state that already know wastes their money isn't really what caused the public debt though.

&gt; Yet I'd like to see the statistics of the, ahem, ethnicity of the rapists. During 2000–2007 in Helsinki, Finland, a shocking 41,4% of rapes were commited by immigrants, whose total number of the population is only 8,3%.

Incorrect.

1. Your statistics concerns only **suspects**. A suspect does not equal to a rapist and a suspicion does not equal to an actual rape by him.

2. Your statistics is cherrypicked from year 2008. It does not include the data available through 2012.

Here´s data from 2012 of rape suspects in Finland (not just Helsinki): http://kuvat.uusisuomi.fi/sites/default/files/imagecache/suurennettu/kuvat/raiskaukset-taulukko.jpg 

And there you can see the amazing effect **even a single person** can achieve in Finnish rape-statistics. In 2010 there was one guy from Morocco who's was a suspected of about 150 accounts of rape and sexual violence (I do not know about his probable convictions). But you can see how suspects from Morocco went from 1 in 2009 to amazing 156 in 2010 and then back to 1 in 2011. I'm not a statiscian by trade but I'd call that an outlier and dismiss as such.


QpH:
&gt; I'm just stating the facts some people don't want to admit – in many African cultures it is okay to rape. 

3.You go from ""41,4% immigrants"" to ""African cultures"" in one giant illogical and incorrect leap. Which is incorrect since many of suspected rapists are not from Africa but from eg. Iraq, Estonia, Russia...

4.It's obviously is not that much about Africa at all.

5.You forget to account for age and social status. 
It is common knowledge that young men are more often suspected of rape than old men. And we know young men do rape more often than older. And most of immigrants are young. This skews the statistics and you should account for that. But you don't.
Remember: *""the best way to prevent violent crime is to become 30 years old""*, as they say even in Finnish crime statistics (please do read them and relevant studies, they are freely available in Oikeuspoliittinen Tutkimuslaitos).

&gt; It makes you a man, even cures AIDS. We must admit this as reality so we can fight against it – not the Africans themselves, but the attitude, their medieval superstitions. If they can't handle living in a modern Western country, they should be thrown out. Not because they're black but because they're utterly unfit for our way of life. Regardless of their skin colour.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"1. A Confederation of states with a written constitution intelligible to people without a degree in European law. No hard bounds set on Union borders. I see no reason why it has to end at the Ural mountains, or the North African coast. A president who's powers are limited in law. The constitution must state what the government is never allowed to do, as well as laying out it's powers. For example, there should be clauses present expressly forbidding the acquisition of ""emergency"" powers in time of crisis. There must be a clear route out for any region within the union that decides it no longer wishes to remain part of it. The military of the union may never be used against citizens of the union, even in ""police"" actions. A European wide senate is elected directly by the populace, as is the president. Recall votes for both members of the Senate the president are allowed at any time during term of office, as determined by popular vote. There is no commission, or equivalent body that places people in executive positions without reference to the people. There is no CAP, or any other such agreement which disproportionally benefits one or more states at the expense of the others. The capital is fixed at one location, along with the required administrative bodies, and there is no longer a migration between Strasbourg and Brussels (which is frankly ridiculous). Government is as open as possible, and the budgets and expenditure for each state are publicly available, as are the voting records of each member of the senate. Bills can be both killed, and proposed, by popular vote, although in the later case they must be approved by the senate before becoming law. I'm going to end this bit now, as it's turning into an essay. 

2. All of the current EU members, plus anyone else who wishes to join, assuming they have a contiguous border with the current EU. 

3. Everything except military and foreign policy is dealt with at a ""national""/state level.

Of course, none of this will ever happen. What we'll get instead is a legal quagmire instead of a real constitution, ever more powerful unelected commission officials instead of a president, and constituent states who are always seeking to benefit at the cost of the others.

Greeks and Finns paid the same (net 63%), more than the Dutch (net 65%) and the French (net 67%).

The dates you arrive and leave mean it might be a very good idea (MUCH simpler and maybe cheaper) to get a Navigo Decouverte.  These are the travel cards for people who are not native to Ile-de-France.  The cards are €5 from any manned ticket kiosk and to ""load"" them with a week on zones 1-5 is around €30, this will ONLY WORK MON-SUN, so when you arrive on the 23rd you will need to use other tickets to get around until the Navigo kicks in the next day.  
So this will cost all in €35 (plus another €5 for a passport photo to stick on it but many people never bother).  Seems a lot but don't forget your ticket to CDG will cost €10 each alone, whereas a zone 1-5 Navigo will take you everywhere you mentioned (and further), no messing around with books of paper tickets (and I guarantee you will forget what can take you where when you come to buying them in the stations).

The entire concept and meaning of the EU is to unify Europe. It's not just a goal, it's the goal. If you look at the history you can clearly see that the growth is in cycles, expansion and then a couple of years of growing pains, now obviously amplified by the eurocrisis which will lead to an even stronger EU.

I'm not sure how important the current European or even Serbian public opinion is. I mean, the whole EU workings are so technocratic, so far removed from voters that their opinions don't matter that much. The EU is not and has never been a popular institution, it's the political elite who power the engine. Obviously the current public opinion is especially low thanks to the inept handling of the eurocrisis, but what is the result: an unprecedented transfer of sovereignty.

Let's see where we started.

* ""In reality, Greek **institutions** suffered the most.""

We've established that we're not talking about individuals (you asked about individuals above).

* ""**They** weren't allowed to sell,""

Unlike banks abroad.

* ""and **some** of them saw their deposits being converted to bonds, before the PSI""

Some individuals? Some Martians? Some institutions? Yes, that must be it. Can we find an example?

* ""X paid cash for **his** contributions, expected to receive amount Y, but his **fund** was offered 'a deal that it couldn't refuse' by the state, where X would have to split his cash in two and burn half of them in a couple of days.""

So, we're talking about Greek institutions, and later on there's the case of Greek funds losing money, while those insured with them paid with cash. This is well documented in Greek media ([example](http://translate.google.gr/translate?sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tovima.gr%2Ffinance%2Farticle%2F%3Faid%3D452339&amp;act=url)), but rarely reported abroad; it's too complicated and there are always the ""journalists"" having their reports ready before they even set foot on Greek soil.

It starts from nation origin, who came first to Balkans, to life under Turks.. oh, it's really complicated. Resolving such conflict doesn't seem to even started. 

For example read this to get little insight:
http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbian-and-albanian-contrasting-history

 So whatever  legally happens with Kosovo in 13 years, that conflict will stay, and will be an open wound for next 100 or 200 years. Especially because people don't feel like justice has been served like in Second World War with Germans. You have people my age who vividly remember conflict, deaths, loss of relatives, loss of houses and so on... and they are going to transfer those feeling to their children etc...

true,bunburya,IREL,Hibernia,"&gt; Which is why there is such a thing as legal precedent. Once you've spent thousands of hours arguing a point, you don't spend thousands of hours doing it a second time. 

But only those with a legal background will know what the precedents are.

&gt; I fail to follow the logic of your argument. You are effectively stating that a constitution should be written in dense legalese, making a strong culture of legal academia a prerequisite, because if it isn't, then you need a strong culture of legal academia to interpret it (?). 

That's not what I'm stating at all. It's possible to have a short constitution, written in simple, minimalist language, and leave the construction largely to the courts. It's also possible to have a constitution consisting largely of ""legalese"", as you call it. Either way works. What I'm stating is that **either way, an individual would require a legal background to fully understand what the constitution says**. You might be able to read the due process clause of the US Constitution and know that you cannot be deprived of life or liberty without due process of law, but you don't know what that means without consulting the case law on the matter.

&gt; Well.. in one instance you have a readable constitution with a set of legal precedents, and in the other, you have a document which is unintelligible to the vast majority of the populace. I'm am strongly opposed to such elitism. It hurts peoples engagement with politics and confines interest in the political to a specialised educated elite. 

Again, a constitution may be ""readable"" without being properly ""intelligible"" by a layman.

Its far, far greater than 1% of Greek society. Corruption is all-pervasive. Public employees make up far too much of the economy. Etc.

No, this is not every Greeks fault in its entirety. Most people deserve some level of blame, but they are not deserving of the pain that is being forced upon them.

The professional class is, IMO, who share most of the blame. Those who avoid tax and lining their pockets.

&gt;I personally believe the only solution is to split the Euro into two currencies maybe like Euro A and Euro B. Greece,Portugal,Spain,Italy,Ireland goes into EUro B and there economies prosper together and Northern Europe goes into Euro A and they prosper together. . .

Ireland's economy will **not** prosper in Euro B. And you know, I dont think Spain, Italy, or Portugal will either.
And I certainly do not think Greece's will.

* Germans are much more soft-spoken than Americans.

* Hyper-masculinity is a big thing in the States, not so in Germany.

* German eyeglasses look much different than the ones Americans buy, and they seem to convey status more.

* Taking safety measures is more important in Germany, except for bicycle helmets.

* This one's a given, but it still gets me how widely cultures and dialect can very even from village to village. Cultural and dialectic regions seem to be much larger in the US.

* There's more respect for political activism (at least in youth culture) - the German status quo is a bit more accepting of criticism than the power elite of the US. Or, at least, political movements enjoy a lot more success in Germany than they do in America, which has much to do with the political structure of the country of course.

* Smoking is more acceptable. People who don't like smoking aren't as in-your-face about it as Americans are.

* This is controversial, but I'd say Germans are much more willing to accept that they've been the bad guys than Americans are. Of course, that's because history's written by the victors, but boy, if I dare criticize anything about America, I will be viciously attacked even by the more ""liberal"" of us. Germans allow themselves to be more self-critical. I guess this ties into more respect for political activism.

But instead of having 10 political party's all have a opinion about many many subjects you vote per subject. you could vote as a lefty on healthcare, while voting right-wing on agriculture. all (or a limited number of) ministeries will have to be voted on individually instead of 1 vote for all the ministeries. It does require some big educational reforms to teach people about all the options and subjects. 

This while also maintaining a lot of power to the european countries. 

2. let spain fall apart, and let catalonia and basques form a country. Since these area's have a better economy then the rest of spain it creates some healthy economic countries in the region of which surrounding countries will also benefit from later on. 

Eastern european countries should only be accepted when the corruption is dealt with. The balkan countries still have a lot of work to do before they are allowed.
Turkey is preferably not accepted in the state it is in now, many journalists in jail, nasty stuff with the kurds, culturally very different and in my view ''old fashion'' and not very secular. Combine that with a large population creating a shitlot of voting power and we got some issues. 

Also lets first set up a demo-union with culturally and economically similar countries and then slowly expand it. The ''germanic'' countries could perhaps first get together and form a federal union together, slowly deciding more rules together. 

4. The world is getting smaller, nations that used to be on the other side of the globe are now next door neighbours, econimical and socially linked. We have to work together, it will save time and money, get rid of pointless difficulties. 
At the same time we also have to make sure we do not give to many rights away to europe, it may be detrimental to progress and culture. letting every country experiment a bit with different rules you could see the effect and let other countries copy it. We have old and new economic super powers that we have to be strong against if we do not want to get abused by them.

Sweden never followed the treaty. You guys never joined the ERM and devalued your currency. Something you bloody well can't do when you join the eurozone.

&gt;why the Belgian debt had to be so high for example

we were doing fine steadily decreasing our debt from the recession of 1992. Almost done basically. Then this crisis hit and we had to bailout one of our banks and shit. There was no other way of doing that. Unless you hold the seed to the magical money growing tree. It's one of those hard long term decisions you mentioned earlier. But belgium can easily carry that because shit like this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Income_Taxes_By_Country.svg and high wages.

If you know a bit about economics you also know that the government debt isn't really representative of the countries economical situation. Its why a big economy like japan can go around with some of the highest gov. debt rates in the world. Its why we have higher debt rates then Spain but unlike them aren't in huge shit right now. 

&gt;I have never said""let them go bankrupt"", I have said a federation, or more integration, or more transfers is not the way to go. 

Well give a sodding solution then. If you people nag about measurements being taken you should have a fitting and viable alternative to shove forward or nobody will ever give a flying fuck about your objections. Because we cant just quit the transfers, reforms and all that stuf because that would equal saying ""let them go bankrupt"".

Both Sweden and Finland had expensive bank collapses in the 90's as well btw, in one year Finland paid 7-8 percent of their GDP and Sweden four, but we never ever needed that much debt. 

Also, while things like GDP, debt etc are blunt instruments, there are the most common ones, and you can't ignore them, just because they are not perfect. In fact, had Italy and Greece (and Belgium) not been let in, the Eurozone would not have been in this predicament!!!! The fact that countries refused to follow the rules made the crises this severe, and this deep. 

There isn't any good reasons not to follow the treaties, pacts and rules one has agreed to, yet the countries in the Eurozone just doesn't. That says a lot about their respect for laws and treaties, but also for the poor countries who actually play by the rules. 

In this thread I said a lot of reasons why I didn't want to be in a federation. I didn't say that I had all the answers in the world. Also, what you are insinuating is that a federation is the only way of going forward is a federation. I think a way forward for example is dividing the Euro in two, or that some countries should leave.

Spliting the euro would be one of the worst ideas ever. It would lead to a complete collapse to one of the 2 currencies and drag countries that weren't in the worst of problems but are using it down with the rest.

It's why federalisation is presented as a solution not as a way forward.

Let me say that i agree with the fact that some countries shouldn't have been in the eurozone/EU. Greece spain and portugal basically joined the eu after leaving dictatorship (to prevent them from falling back in that state) This more so for greece since it was the only country for which the council disregarded the commisions objection to them joining. and some of eastern europe were also taken in in a similar way.

Everything SOUTH of the ""machen maken"" line is a High German dialect which are separated in ""Mittel"" (middle) and ""Ober"" (upper) German dialects but ""upper"" means here the height of the land (mountains).

Bavarians speak an Upper German dialect so one of the High German dialects.  Everything above the ""maken - machen"" line is called a ""Niederdeutsch"" (that means lower German. Again, hight of the land, I suppose) dialect. 

Maybe you notice something here: 

Deutsch (the German word for German) - Dutch

Niederlande (the German word for Netherlands) - Netherlands 

Right. Modern Dutch evolved out of a Lower German dialect and the old ""Platt"" (that's what you call Lower German dialects) from the north sounds a lot like Dutch without those hard sounds.

But those Lower German dialects can vary a lot and they've changed in time. If you look at the map, Düsseldorf is north of the maken - machen line. The dialect here is also called ""Düsseldorfer Platt"". But it sounds a lot more like Kölsch (dialect from Cologne (Köln in German)) than a Hamburger dialect.

I will make an example about the sector where I work (when I'm not on reddit), academia.


I'm doing a PhD in social economics. As may guess, the *best* academic journals for social economics - or economics in general - are Americans (from USA). The editors of those journals, are, in most cases, *us*ians too. It happens that those people had been exposed to certain values, way of thinks, world-views and so on. Like evrybody on this planet, they grow in in a particular culture and they usually share the same weltanschauung.


Those journals are pretty important for the academic carrier of every PhD students and professors around the world. Because is only publishing on those journals that your career will progress. So a small bunch of editors of those journals can control - more or less - the fate of many academics around the world. 


Here came the role of English: mainly ""american"" values are promoted by those journals, and those journals tend to publish only articles that fit their worldview. Why neoliberalism was going strong in the '80s around the world? Because in USA the neoliberal movement was the shit, it was intellectually fashionable to be neoliberal, and everybody around the world had to follow this trend if he wanted to get published and progress in his academic career. The best rated journals were publishing only neoliberal papers, and only neoliberal people obtained a chair because of that. This *[performative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Do_Things_With_Words#How_to_Do_Things_With_Words)* effect is a direct consequence of the use of the English language.


Obliviously, it's not English intrinsic fault. But that's happens exactly because English is not neutral, but is backed by a particular societal structure. English is the language of the rich and powerful. Not a lingua franca.


The dominance of English doesn't work only between different languages, but also within the anglosphere. How many times do you feel that the average american read a book written by a Nigerian writer, or listen a song by a Pilipino band? The dominance of the English language is in fact the dominance of the rich, and sometimes I feel that globalization is just a political correct term to say imperialism.


When latin was a ""lingua franca"", nobody spoke latin anymore, and latin was not backed by any political power. That's a true lingua franca. Otherwise, I'm sorry, but it's not a lingua franca.


There are many scholars that study the ""economy of language"" and they quantify this [exorbitant privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorbitant_privilege) (because language is like money). I'm not an expert of the field, but if you're interested I can dig more.


What bug me a lot of the idea of *English lingua franca* is the ""lingua franca"" narrative. As if English is a *neutral* medium of communication. Like if the global language was Spanish (or whatever), it would be the same thing.
My point, is that we can't think about English, without thinking also about the societal structure and values behind English. And this ""societal structure"" is all but neutral.

The result was debt was erased quickly instead of being loaded onto the people. 

In contrast, the US Federal reserve announced a new program to buy mortgage backed securities last week and the banking stocks immediately went up while the US dollar went down.  Once again, the banks are bailed out and the taxpayer gets the debt.

Europeans have got to stop buying the Democrat's line about the Tea Party.  The Tea Party was born when Americans realized that their government's spending was leading their country towards ruin.  The financial problems in the Eurozone and the UK are good examples of what is in the US's future.  The US already exceeds the debt level of Europe, but the willingness of our Federal reserve to print money and the fact that the dollar is a world currency, gives the US a little more time to reform it's spending.  The Tea Party is the only popular movement that is working towards financially responsible government.

Consider what a ""greek"" US would mean to Europe.  20% of your exports are to the US.  The Tea Party wants the US to reform its finances now, and not wait until it disrupts trade.

Neither of our two major political parties, the Democrats or Republicans, are interested in financial reform.  The Democrats are  especially against the Tea Party because that party represents government workers.  That's why they have labeled it ""racist"" and lied about it's goal.  The Tea Party's goal is to not to burden our children with our debt.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"It seems a bit strange that you would point to Latin as a sort of Utopian lingua franca, with no power behind it, without mentioning the Roman Empire, and afterwards, the church. And that you would then criticize English as being the language of the rich and powerful, while praising Latin, which was, in the medieval period, only ever known by a tiny elite.

It is pretty clear that a lingua franca inevitably has some degree of political baggage, but its weight can vary. To a certain degree, it is down to adoption. For instance, it's clear that reddit is dominated by American culture, but that's because Americans make up a high percentage of online English speakers. As adoption of English increases, American influence over the commons decreases. And the same holds for your argument of Americans who read Anglo-Indian novels.

I don't think that your economics journal example is actually about language at all, it's about globalization, about the free exchange of ideas. English enables globalization, which encourages academic hegemonies to occur, but another language policy which was equally successful at allowing exchange of ideas, would have the same problem. The reason American economists are in that position isn't because they speak English, it's because they are the leaders of a single global academic community, the same reason you see many high profile German journals in Chemistry, or why one of the largest (and most predatory) academic publishers is from the Netherlands. Of course, being a leader can be just as much about fashion as actual competence, especially with humanities subjects, but that is a property of the ability to communicate, not the means by which you achieve that communication.

Now, there are intractable problems with the prospect of English as lingua franca. For instance, if Europeans all speak English, everyone can watch British and American TV without subtitles, but not the domestic TV of non-Anglo nations. There's a risk of progressive domain loss, which no one wants to see. But we are not choosing between one perfect and one imperfect solution. You criticize English as being elitist, but the only alternative is making people learn multiple extra languages. Put those hypothetical people in a room, and either they all know one language, in which case the switch is futile, or they don't, and it is only the wildly well educated who would know a sufficient array of languages to be able to communicate with any other person in the group. And no one would be able to stand up and address everyone simultaneously. Moreover, if we're just to learn French and German, that does wonders to protect French and German language and culture, but does nothing for speakers of other languages.

There's no perfect solution, but English is the best we've got. And I'll go further, it is, in my opinion, the only realistic way for Europe to become a cohesive entity. ",0,1347849737,null,0,1347851468,0,c697sh3,t3_zzphx,t1_c697sh3,t1_c695zl1,null,1429917141,26,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,26

true,azdoggnaro,sicilia,,"Funny story...somewhat applicable.
I moved back to Italy 2 years ago. For the first year we (my wife and I) lived next to her parents in the city of Naro (Agrigento, Sicily). I worked wherever I could to bring home some bread (literally). For about 5 months I worked in the countryside....olives, grapes, mandorle, etc. Without fail at the end of ever day, the landlord would be sitting there passing out the day's pay to the workers. I worked with North Africans, Romanians, other Eastern Europeans and Sicilians. The Africans would normally get 35-40 euro, other Europeans: 45 euro. Sicilians: 50 euro.  Now, I am an Ohioan...German blood. There is no mistaking me for an Italian. I would always get asked: where are you from. After stating that I was American: 50 euro. Every time. I was always treated with a sliver more respect than the others. Simply put: xenophobic mentality.  In that small city, Naro, there are now around 4,500 Romanians out of the roughly 8,000 people inhabit the agriculture suburb.  
The situation is just like a microcosm of America (or any country struggling with immigration). Stranieri are taking over in Italy. They are doing the work that the newer generation of Italians don't want to do. False sense of entitlement? Laziness? Call it what you will but this work; agricultural, construction, fishing, etc... has all contributed to the beautiful culture that makes Italy Italy. Course, this is happening everywhere in Europe.

Unfortunately, all your black market money and the general insecurity you helped incite a run so that prices have gone up 30% in the last  years. In addition to that, interest rates are way down so having cash around means losing money with Dragi proposing 5 % inflation so we can accommodate the southerners way of doing business.

On voit déjà des partis comme le Front National utiliser cet argument pour expliquer partiellement (à tort ou à raison) les problèmes économiques français. Une bonne partie des lois votées à l'Assemblée Nationale découlent déjà de lois et directives européennes. Et nos marges de manœuvres sont fortement limitées, déjà, sur ce point.

Une taxe unique, sans différenciation entre les pays, implique également qu'aucun pays ne pourra modeler comme il le souhaite son budget, son niveau de prélèvement obligatoire, etc.

Dans le cas où tu laisses un chouïa de liberté à ce niveau-là, il y aura différenciation fiscale. Le citoyen français ne connaît pas que l'impôt sur le revenu (une minorité de nos recettes !)... il y a aussi la TVA, la CSG, les taxes multiples sur de multiples produits (clopes, redevance, produits pétroliers), les impôts locaux (qui amènent déjà les collectivités à se tirer la bourre entre elles, comme la Suisse le fait avec d'autres pays), l'impôt sur les sociétés, etc.

Qu'est-ce qui empêcherait un pays de se différencier par la disparition d'un de ces impôts ? Par la hausse ou la baisse d'un autre ? Et si un pays a envie d'un peu plus investir sans pour autant endetter ses contribuables (impôt à long terme ou inflation), mais plutôt en les imposant un peu plus à un instant T ?

Which also as krattr indicated to you in other comments can be absurd now and don't really help paying you back. 

And while I get what you are saying, when I read your problems, shouldn't you be angry at the economic system and your politicians also? After all it was also in their planning to operate Europe in this way. Other southern states have also problems and maybe more will come. Is it that because all southerners are lazy and steal?

As I said again I never found this idea reasonable. Having the same currency for all these totally different states. We are not United States of Europe yet, we are very far from it. But nobody asked me. They force it on us. As in many other countries where referendums didn't happen. I see it more importantly right now that middle and lower class people of every country are angry at how the economic system is unfair for everybody and not angry at each other. I think it makes us lose the big picture. It's like Golden Dawn members accusing the immigrants of the crisis and making pogroms against them.

What I get from all this is that Greeks simply don't see themselves responsible. ""I didn't get any money"", ""no one ever lost a single cent"", ""it's how our society works"" etc. The last one in particular basically means that we should cut you lose because you don't seem like even *wanting* to change.

Like when Samaras was here and was droning about how the ""proud Greeks"" don't want to be indebted. Well, duh, asshole. *No one* wants you to be indebted. 

This does not earn you any points in the current climate.

I fully agree that the debate is full of stereotypes and - as it is a very complex matter - full of what kattr sees as half-truths. As it's the nature of complex matters to be able to get viewed from more than one side.

But from my point of view, *your side* has fucked up huge and IMO needs to be *way* more humble and accommodating if you ever plan to earn some respect again. And that includes posting on reddit.

The situation, as a whole, is a lot more complicated than you've put it.

One of your statement is correct: a lot of people feel like we are slowly being taken over by foreign immigrants.

The enmity towards Eastern Europeans and African is due to the fact we have a poor immigration policy: it's difficult to kick out of the country convicted or illegal immigrants and, during the 90s, only a small percentage was intercepted on the way here.

As you can imagine, it's hard to patrol our borders, which are almost entirely coasts.

And it's easy to figure out what an illegal immigrant would end up doing, if he can't manage to find a job: robbery, prostitution and drug dealing. I used to live in a small city in Liguria, which was overrun by foreign criminals, it was dangerous to walk by the main square even in broad daylight.

Our police officers have their hands tied and they risk to lose their job or conviction if they try anything too rough. 

Having been a rescue volunteer for 10 years, I have a lot of stories I could share. I have never dealt so much with African immigrants than I've done during that time span and, believe me, that had me change my mind about them - in a *very* negative way.

I have a friend from Tunisia, one from Morocco and one whose parents are Albanian - but he's probably more Italian than me, being in the army.

Another thing you got wrong is that ""stranieri are doing the work the new generation Italians don't want to"". This is, sadly, not true: employers know they can pay an immigrant a lot less than they would have to if they were employing an Italian.

My estranged father employs *only* immigrants (at least he used to five years ago) because he knows he can exploit the fact they don't know their rights. The same goes with every countryside landlord or factory owner. With an unemployment rate as high as ours, it's difficult to rationalize and thinking ""it's not the immigrants that are taking over, it's the *employers*"" hence why a lot of people hate them.

'High school' in the Netherlands currently has 3 different levels. VMBO (level 1), HAVO (level 2) and VWO (level 3). 

VMBO (4 years) is basic education, mosly focused on preparing you for practical jobs. HAVO (5 years) is mostly meant to prepare you for more intellectually challenging jobs, VWO (6 years) is meant to prepare you for college/university.

For all levels, english is compulsory.
In VWO (which I have done) french and german are compulsory at least the first 3 years.
In VMBO and HAVO either 0 or 1 of the languages are compulsory (not sure of the specifics).

I suspect the reason most people choose german (and I think this is also why the original source says german is thought the most as a tertairy language) is because german is much more like dutch, and thus a lot easier for most dutchmen.

No of course not. Thats not what I was implying, though I see how it could come across that way. I was simply stating that they don't *deserve* to live in an impoverished country, not that the solution is for them to leave and go to another country.

Ideally, the answer to illegal immigration is to make the home immigrant's country desirable to live in. Of course, due complicated socio-political issues, this is far from a simple process.

What I was trying to say in my last post was simply that illegal immigration policy often revolves around physically stopping illegal immigrants, rather than fighting the root causes.

And I don't know if you noticed, but that article you linked from 2010 (*US bailouts prevented 1930s-style Great Depression say economists*) - did you know that today's crisis is actually comparable to the one from 1930s, and some experts predict that it will be even worse, as there still isn't any end of it in sights, and that experts say that reason why the crisis is so deep is exactly because of bailouts? That article from 2010 was writing as the bailouts up to the 2010 would save economy from going exactly were we are today in 2012. So I wouldn't quote 'experts' who in 2010 said: 

*""...the US economy has made ""enormous progress"" since its nadir last year: ""Maybe the country and the world were just lucky. But we take another view: the great recession gave way to recovery as quickly as it did largely because of the unprecedented responses by monetary and fiscal policymakers.""*  **Where is that 'quick recovery' in 2010, I certainly don't remember anything like it, and I don't see it even today in 2012?**

Can you give me one example where it is clear that bailouts saved the economy of some country?

A third of those companies that have delisted themselves state the quotas as the reason for doing so. Further, the lack of qualified women has led to a situation where the main winners of the Norwegian quota system are a very small minority of women (about 30-40 in number – generally called the Gold Skirts) who have assumed a large number of board seats of various companies. Thus some of those women are now on 6,7,8 or even 9 boards (no men sits on more than five boards) – you do the math on whether you think one can diligently sit on this many boards and still do ones job with satisfaction. This lack of qualified female candidates has also resulted in a many women from neighbouring countries – Denmark, Sweden – filling up the boards. So in general a lot less companies; a few more women on the remaining companies, but only benefiting a very small minority of women. And in general the profitability of the Norwegian companies have taken a hit due to the quota system:

&gt; We find that the constraint imposed by the law resulted in a significantly negative impact on firm value, consistent with the idea that firms choose boards to maximize value. The value loss was not, however, caused by the sex of the new board members, but rather by their younger age and lack of high-level work experience. This is consistent with an advisory and monitoring role for the board.

What made people react was a very, very special context : at this time, DSK had a very big probability of becoming the next French president and was very close to becoming the official left-wing candidate. Had these charges been invented or false (remember that he finally was not considered guilty in his trial) these images would have had a very strong effect on the elections. 

In France, during an election, there is a rule of equal access to media outlets for all candidates. Showing one handcuffed at the beginning of a campaign, whereas he was just a suspect, was really giving an unfair advantage to his adversary. This is why there has been some instinctive outrage, mainly amongst his political friends.

I still have mixed feeling over this whole issue. The guy has been recognized innocent on this case and lost the opportunity to run for president. On the other hand, political schedule is not a good excuse to prevent the justice from working.

In a system as complex as the German railway system, delays propagate.

Unfortunately, the IC is supposed to go right back where it came from, so the next IC also has 15 minutes delay. That IC has a connection to an ICE which now gains 10 minutes delay.

And what I meant was that I thought that this is likely to mean that every day people have to argue their boundaries/wishes/plans ad nauseam. 

And to be quite honest, I think it's a bit childish to assert that people now live 'petrified' by law, routine and superstition. The one most likely to be petrified of is that one which changes most often; law. In a democratic nation law does change. It changes slowly, and I think that the change of law SHOULD be slow. Routine might be the hardest one to duck out of, especially if the position of the employee/student/anything else is rigidly defined.

A third thought, just came to mind, is that superstition might merely change if working by consensus; at the moment it is quite possibly to 'free' oneself of institutionalized superstition; no confessional party would, for example, ever get my vote, nor do I enter places of worship with the intent to worship.

&gt; When latin was a ""lingua franca"", nobody spoke latin anymore, and latin was not backed by any political power. That's a true lingua franca. Otherwise, I'm sorry, but it's not a lingua franca.

This is truly ridiculous. Ignoring the fact that before the C15th the Church monopoly on Latin was very much about money and power with the Church as perhaps the most powerful and important political entity in Europe for a thousand years before that point... you're also stating that only a *dead* language could really be a *lingua franca*. What the hell is the use of using a dead language as a medium of communication? 

It seems to me like you're simply sore about the fact that you are not a native English speaker, and therefore see yourself as at an unfair disadvantage to other English speakers. That will change in the coming decades, as the majority of the worlds English speakers will be from outside the Anglophone world. At that point, it will be people from *within* the Anglophone world who will be at a disadvantage, as we'll have to restructure and restrict our use of language in order to make ourselves understood. This is already happening within the EU, as representatives from most European nations can understand each others verbal English, but native speakers need to have their words translated because of the way in which they use the language.

cis? Anyway, I'm an atheist so at least I'm not playing on the easiest difficulty level supposedly (though I must say that in high tech we do seem to outnumber the shit out of religious people)

&gt; People at the bottom who are female might be getting more abuse than the men, and this could get rid of them and explain why there is a difference at the top.

There's been a fair bit of studying done of this (and yes, I saw you ask for references... I read about this in the economist myself):     
Fundamental problem is that women face a really hard choice between 25 and 35, when careers are being made or broken. Women either have children then or risk having them a bit later (bad for the children). In either case having a standard-ish family (2 pregnancies) will disable you for 12-24 months. In particularly fast moving spaces where many of the greatest careers are forged, these breaks are particularly bad. To survive them, it is very healthy to be in spaces that don't move at such breakneck pace... so avoid high tech, and prefer things like HR (most static of them all), law and the care industries - these will be pretty similar 2 or even 5 years down the road.

Guys have a number of options. They can have children at age 50 if they so wish and that's fine (women can theoretically too, but it just isn't very practical). They can get someone who stays home (again, possible for women, but not nearly as practical).

Also, women seem far less interested in the massive uncertain &amp; rejection fest that is high tech entrepreneurship (basically: where you have to beg for money from VCs). There might even be a biological element to this - lord knows if I designed the genders, I suspect making the women prefer stability would make the species thrive.

Considering a LOT of people at the very top of the world are entrepreneurs, it's kind of hard to blame men for it as long as 9 out of 10 people that try to start high growth companies are male (and the number is often higher than that).",0,1347901530,null,0,false,0,c69go9r,t3_100mj1,t1_c69go9r,t1_c69fjo2,null,1429921401,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

And Vaclav Klaus whom you've been referring to is slive and is still a president of Czech Republic. I think you mistook him for Vaclav Havel. And he was a liberal, very enthusiastic about the EU. But your presupmtions about the reasons behind a big reserve concerning the EU are correct. I feel that we shouldn't lose our independce to other bureaucratic Moloch only after 20 years of freedom. We should have some place to manuever. Before 2nd WW people didn't believe that after the Great War such a trgedy would take place so soon. I think that we should take this lesson seroiusly and be very careful. And giving such a power to the best governed state of the EU, which happens to be Germany, is not careful enough. I am suspicious of Germany and I fear of its rising power both in economy and international politics. And not because I think that Germany itself is a threat (however those dickheads that come to polish western voyvodships and hand out some Grosse Reich pamphlets should get their asses kicked by someone) but because I'm feeling that the disparities in Europe are bigger every day and people are starting to feel uneasy. And that's a good ground for a revolution. And revolutions are not a good thing.

I've also wanted to write one more thing about culture of politics and media in western countries (large chunk of polish media and politics including) that I don't like - heglism. I don't have enough time to write much about it but e.g. heglian view on other cultures is the only one that is acceptable for most of westerners (basically it means that they treat their own liberal culture and welfare state model as the only appliable to a civilised country, treat people from their own culture who have other ideas on life and society as a burden or idiots (vide: /r/atheism) and other cultures as less civilised (China/Burma/whatever should be lib-dem; no, they shouldn't, we shouldn't force others to be ""happy"" based on our beliefs or supposition).

The Frecciargento connecting Florence to Venice is very nice and comfortable.  We loved it.  Except for the massive delays, which I don't think are typical, and the train terminating in Mestre instead of at Santa Lucia, which I hear IS typical.

There was a station fire at Termini the day we left from Florence to Venice, so our train was delayed 5 hours and was a standing room only affair.  Luckily, we got on the actual train we'd reserved, so we got our seats.

However, being told that the train won't continue to Santa Lucia sucked.  On an already overcrowded day, they wanted us to get off and go get on a regional train to Santa Lucia, which was unreserved, and basically had 3 trains' worth of passengers making a dash at.  We ended up hailing a cab who took us to a water taxi, but that basically was 80 euro right there.

I STILL suggest taking the train, but have a backup plan if there are delays.  And plan for the train to stop in Mestre, and treat it as a nice treat if it heads to Santa Lucia.",0,1347902523,null,0,false,0,c69gxl5,t3_1012ev,t1_c69gxl5,t3_1012ev,null,1429921518,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

And in this particular case it meant to say what *you* personally would also call that someone who did something like that to *you*. I'm sure you get that.

&gt; so maybe you should just let a few Greeks shout a bit and blow some steam off

You posted the original story with the (I suppose) idea to show that there might be some sympathy in other countries for your plight. I meant to tell you, that, well, maybe there is, but it's *way* in the minority. 

*I* for one am seriously fed up with these posts and will do my best to silence them. I'm a bit more elaborate than txampion, but maybe what he really means is ""jesus, shut the fuck up already and get things done"" (instead of ""XX pay yours debnts!"")

And as I said, IMO, it would be way better if you tried to post something positive (kittens always work, but maybe you'll come up with something better:). This might sound a bit flippant, but I truly think it would help frame the story about Greeks differently. An example was the story about the potatoes that got directly from the producers to the city people. Don't remember exactly where and when this was. It shows you are creative and try to get things done and are upbeat.

&gt; But you didn't comment on what you think about your politicians. 

Oh gee... I think Angela Merkel has done a very, very poor job at the beginning of this mess, because she thought she needed to win an election that was coming up. After that poor start, she couldn't really go back on what she said without us all losing face. After *that*, the media frenzy started and then this was basically over. None of this actually has to do with Greece. (But I also think: you fuck up, you pay, you tough it out etc, like above).

&gt; Or the way that the eurozone was created. Do you think it's a good idea? 

I don't know if you know this, but German people were *mortified* by the Euro. They expected exactly this mess to happen and guess what, it did. But - as the story goes - we wanted reunification without paying for WW 2 and we were forced by France to agree to the Euro as to get rid of the Deutsche Mark. So ten years later, here we are :/

I read a very interesting book from a German economist whose theory was that we sneakily fucked the Eurozone. While everyone else was increasing wages and raised inflation, over ten years we held inflation at 1-2% (whereas Maastricht allowed for 3 %) and didn't increase wages and social services. Which means over ten years we got ~30 % cheaper in producing our stuff pricing all of you out of the market. 

I'm not sure he's right, and even if he is, it'd be kind of lame of the southerners to admit they've asleep at the wheel for 10 years. But it goes to show that there are a lot of levels to this whole problem.

&gt; I mean I believe we either have to call this thing off or continue to a true political/economical union, only that justifies a single currency in my opinion. 

I'll be totally honest and say this: Sometimes, I believe that through bungling of basically everyone else, we finally won WW 2. It's not over yet, we might still ""lose"", but if you control the budget and money and debt of states, you don't need the land, industry and stuff anymore.

I don't really know if that's good or bad. I'm pretty sure I don't want to be responsible for all these states.

true,rmc,IREL,Ireland,"&gt; But as less men want to be nurses for whatever reasons

One potential reason is because some men might see it as ""weak"", ""effeminiate"", an ""woman's job"", a ""gay job"", ""pansy"" etc. This means men who could be good nurses are not able to enter that profession, some men might not want to put up with the social stigma, jokes from friends &amp; family, and shy away from it. This is wrong.

Remember, sexism and strict gender roles can affect men too, and tell a man that he shouldn't do things that he wants to do. This is wrong.

As to standards, well it depends if men are not doing it because they think it's a ""girly job"" (the wrong reason), or they are not good at it. If men are not doing it for the wrong reasons, it follows that some men could be good nurses are not becoming nurses, and the bar for women might hence be lower.

Zwar könnte man den Irakkrieg unter den Begriff des 'crime of aggression' subsumieren.

Aber erstens sind die USA keine Partei des Rome Statute. Damit wäre Bush schonmal raus.

Und zweitens würde selbst für Blair ein umfassendes Rückwirkungsverbot nach Art. 15 ter Nr. 2 gelten. Wenn ich das richtig lese, steht darin, dass Angriffskriege nur verfolgt werden, wenn sie ein Jahr nach Ratifizierung durch den betroffenen Staat begangen werden.
