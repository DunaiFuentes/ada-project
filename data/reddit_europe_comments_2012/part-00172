By the sound of it the whole two-tier EU thing would be the best solution for everyone. Any member state should go ahead and federalise themselves as much as they like. The ""European Federation"" could even declare itself as a sovereign state if they wanted.

The EU, however, could continue to exist and maintain free trade and co-operative efforts where consensus is established, and would consist of the EF and the states that choose not to federalise. 

The EF can then hold its doors open to EU members that are willing and fulfil European statehood criteria at any time. It leaves options open both for the status quo and further integration should the EF prove successful and other EU member states want to join.

I'm personally skeptical of whether total political union would benefit the UK, considering that we're not in the Eurozone, but I think it would be a good thing for countries that are already in the Eurozone and see no reason to stop those countries should they be willing. 

Additionally, it puts the EF in a situation where it is incentivised to improve itself on a democratic basis. The more it improves, the more likely that non-Eurozone members will vote to join it, the more territory and power it wields.

If France left, it would probably eventually cause the end of the EU, because ultimately, France is essential to it. The top three economies of Europe are Germany, France and the UK. Take France out of the EU, and the increasingly eurosceptic UK, and you're left with only Germany to drive it.

For example, on the first Sunday of every month, all (most) museums are free, where the term museums is used loosely (for example, the Arc de triomphe is included - which you should definitely ascend the shit out of! [10€]), so if you took the expensive ones that day, you may save a bit.

I always stayed in Montmartre, as it is quite cheap and also one of the liveliest places in the city. Not to mention Sacré-Cœur is one of my favourite places. Make sure you also ascend the shit out of that (5-10€).

For eating, if you are in the touristy areas, you are looking at 25€ for a serving, and to give you advice you will already know, stay off the beaten track. You will pay less and have more fun.

Drinking, again is location dependent, but if you are paying more than 8€ for a pint you are getting screwed.

It's basically come down to a class war.  
  
With so many economic problems in Spain, Greece, Portugal and so on, rich people are fleeing those countries and looking for attractive investments. The major cities of Germany have been more than accomodating. Many of the low income areas are targets of ""improvement investors"" and stop at pretty much nothing to push out the locals.  
  
Rent prices in cities like Hamburg, München, Berlin, and Frankfurt have risen nearly 35% in just 2 years forcing many people out of areas in which they were born and raised. Lower incomes are being forced out to the edges of the cities because the inner city areas are being ""improved"".

There are other exonims that are considered insulting. Lapp is one. Eskimo is another (in Canada and Greenland). Hottentot and Bushmen yet another.

&gt;Yes, both Gypsy and Vlach (Olah in Hungarian) are exonyms. But I don't think I've ever met a fellow Romanian saying he was insulted by being called Wallachian.

There is a misunderstanding here. The fact that there is a Greek word translating to ""untouchables"", is not evidence per se. Also, the fact that they claimed they were persecuted as Christians in Egypt, is not evidence that *some* Indian groups didn't arrive via Egypt, centuries before that incident.

What I mean by ""linguistic evidence"" is that the terminology used by nations contacting today's Roma (europah below is right about its use as an umbrella term), helps in researching the patterns of migration. Oxford Professor [Norman Davies](http://www.normandavies.com/biography.html), author of [""Europe: A History""](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40631.Europe), wrote:

&gt; In 1378 the Venetian Governor of Nauplion in the Peloponnese confirmed priviliges already granted to the local community of atsingani. It was the first documented record of Romany gypsies in Europe. [...] In August 1427 a band of some travellers, presenting themselves as victims of persecution in Lower Egypt, were refused entry to Paris and lodged instead at St Denis. [...] There is no doubt that the Romanies migrated to Europe from India, although *their earlier movements can only be reconstructed from linguistic evidence.*

I support the same thing. I didn't say that we should compare their modern dialects in Europe with older dialects in India, and see if they match.

Hopefully my position is clear now. :)

Yes there is a race involved. ""Irish"". Various countries laws state this is a race. People in Ireland (&amp; England/Britain) will claim they are not the same race/ethnicity as each other.

There are other examples such as Irish people working in England in the 1960s/70s/80s who were spied on by employers &amp; the (UK) state with the presumption that they were terrorists, merely because they were one race. That's very little to do with religion.

&gt; maybe this is just me, but i can't for the life of me tell whether someone is a gypsy until they start doing something typically associated with gypsies.

Maybe it is just you &amp; the area you're in. Here Roma people dress a very distinctly way, and accents can be very different. Just do a google image search for ""Roma gypsy"" or likewise and you'll see the sort of clothing I'm talking about.

&gt; i've been told there are a lot of gypsies who wear pajamas everywhere they go

This is very local dependent. In my area lower economic class women would often wear pajamas outside. They are not Roma (nor are they the local Irish Travellers). Again, depends what people in the local area do.

&gt; i think that when people cry ""racism"" at this issue

Or, y'know, it's actual racism. That hasn't gone away. There have been racist genocides in Europe in the last 15 years.

Edit because I'm not an ass hole *all* the time:  

In July of 2010, I took a two-week trip to Paris and it cost me 1000 USD (flight included).  Mind you, I am a penny-pinching, deal-swooping hawk.  I didn't splurge on goodies and shopping, I was there to see the sights.  I also did not have to pay for my accommodation.  

1.  Research [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/s/paris--france?room_types%5B%5D=Entire+home%2Fapt&amp;price_max=58).  I am not a representative of Airbnb, I just really. love. that. website.  I have had great experiences with it--in fact, I'm using it to travel to Strasbourg for Christmas.  You can find an entire flat, all to yourself, for less than 60 euros/night within the city limits.  That's cheaper than hotels, and you get a private bathroom, kitchen, etc.  This enables you to save money because you can cook your own food.  Eating out in Paris is mind-blowingly expensive.

2.  Know where you can find cheap stuff.  Franprix is cheaper than Monoprix.  Simply Market is cheaper than the other supermarkets.  Once you figure out where you're going to stay, scout out the locations of these places within your neighborhood. 

3.  Stay in an area like the 10th, 11th, or 20th arrondissements.  Cheaper, great Asian food, cheaper bars.  If you want a list of my personal favorite bars or cafés in those areas, send me a PM.  

4.  Find your flights via Skyscanner.com or Cheapoair.com.  I have always used those two sites, and I have never spent more than 685 US dollars on a round-trip flight.  I usually fly with XL Airways France.  The seats are small, but it's a quick flight (usually around 6.5 hours) and you can sleep, especially if you have your cuddle buddy.  Buy a neck pillow and bring a little blankie, that's what I do.  

5.  It was always cheaper for me to use my U.S. bank card instead of withdrawing from ATMs or exchanging cash.  That is because my bank had low international transaction fees.  Research that.  But remember, if you are American,  your card does not have a microchip, and you may encounter some issues.  It will work in stores and at ATMs, but you can't rent bicycles via the Velib public bike system. 

6.  Research places where you might **not** want to stay.  That's not to say that those places are DANGEROUS, but that, as a tourist, you may not find them very appealing.  Pigalle or Barbès-Rochechouart may fall into this category.  

7.  Don't worry about being far from the city center.  You don't want to stay outside of the city limits in the banlieue, but as long as you're near a mètro station,  you are never far from another area of Paris.  Unless you're all the way at the end of the No 9. :-D

8.  I didn't go to the top of the Eiffel tower on my vacation, and I never went up there during the year that I lived in Paris.  I don't really regret that.  Unless you're a fanatic about high places, it's not really necessary.  Go to Sacré-Coeur, the view is gorgeous.  Go to the top of that big ugly building, la tour montparnasse.

(Frankly, by far the most America-bashing I've seen amongst Europeans has been on r/europe). The worst comments I've gotten have always been in the form of a question. People are genuinely curious about the US, they hear about us all the time (the poor things) and want to hear about things from the perspective of a ""real"" American, rather than one they see on TV. For me it's best to only talk about your country to the extent that you can sense the other people are interested in hearing about it. To complain excessively about how things are so backwards in the US (they're not really, btw, both continents have aspects that are a bit messed up) is actually to come across as being too nationalistic, obsessed with your country and its image.

First, go to Cafe Angelina on Rue de Rivoli and have the hot chocolate there.  It's famous, pricey, and touristy, but it is pretty much like a melted bar of chocolate in your cup and worth it.

Second, as mentioned, David Lebowitz talks a lot about chocolate.  The store L'Etoile d'Or on Rue Pierre Fontaine is mentioned a lot by him, and is quite excellent, with a very eccentric owner (who really doesn't speak English). The Bernachon chocolates are around 11 euro a bar, but are worth the one time splurge, and there are a bunch of other things to try.

Since you like chocolate and maybe pastries/sweets, I'll also recommend Jacques Grenin, which is on rue de Turenne.  His hot chocolate is also supposed to be excellent, though I've never had it.  However, the caramels there are amazing.  Again, a splurge since individually they cost about 1 euro each for a tiny little caramel, but they are the most divine caramels in the world.

One last one for now is Sadaharu Aoki, who has a few locations in the city.  He is a Japanese pastry chef who mixes classic French pastries with Asian ingredients.  I particularly recommend the black sesame eclairs, though the salted caramel tarte and pretty much everything else are really good too.

People view immigrants as less social and a bigger threat.

Why? Because we don't respect them and never really respected them. 
Initial 'true' racism from the 50's has instilled skepticism in a lot of immigrant families as to finding happiness in our countries. We made them want to go back to their country of origin, and that's where they see their future. Young kids raised in this climate don't respect our rules at all, and just 'play the game', since they truly believe their future is elsewhere. It's like clogging the toilet at your bully's birthday party, you wouldn't even feel guilty... Also, the media don't want to acknowledge this trend out of fear of getting labeled 'racist', so important details are left out... This vicious cycle keeps on going, which is why we see so much 'radicalisation' in Europe, both on the immigrants' as the extreme right's side.

I used Orange when I was in Western Europe for four months. It worked well enough, though I'm not sure how the prices are compared to other carriers. They were recommended by my university for what that's worth. 

As for how the system works in general: most people in my program bought prepaid phones that you can refill with more minutes/data when you run out. I'm fairly certain that phone carriers don't offer monthly contracts for only a few months. 

Most carriers will have partners in other countries that provide you service while you're on their network. You will get a text message alerting you when you've joined a new network and what the local rates are. (Note: these messages may not be in English. The numbers are usually enough to get the point across though.)

The cost will vary based on how much you use your phone, what kind of phone you buy, etc. I would plan on around €20/month at the cheapest. I probably spent around €25 using the cheapest phone possible (borrowed from a friend) including a few texts per day and only a few calls per month. Keep in mind it generally does not cost you money/credit to receive calls or texts, though international calls will probably still cost you.

No, the pie chart on the rights shows their market share in Europe, it doesn't take sales elsewhere into account.

The chart on the left shows how many less cars the respective companies sold in Europe in the first ten months of this year, compared to the same time frame of last year. For example, Fiat sold 16.3% less (in Europe) compared to their sales figures from the year before. On the right, you can see how 6.5% of the cars sold in Europe were Fiats. Sales figures elsewhere aren't considered at all in those two charts.  
Put differently, in the one of the left, the companies are compared to their own performance last year, and on the right they're shown relative to each other's sales this year.

It's actually a bit unclear what exactly those figures relate to. The wording ""other brands"" on the left seems to indicate that this is about, well, brands, but given the size of VW's share and that Peugeot on Citroen are taken together, it seems to be about manufacturers. This would mean that VW includes Audi, Seat and their smaller luxury brands, that Fiat includes Chrysler, GM really means Opel/Vauxhall and so on.

The way this relates to the state of the European economy is that manufacturers (read: buyers) of small cars are especially affected, while rich people seem to be doing OK.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Zerohedge is basically a tabloid. They like rumors, scandals, sensations, conspiracy theories and how the world is coming to an end. I remember them once running a story where they propagated a rumor that Germany had already ordered new DM bills -- utterly ridiculous, but hey, as long as people click on it...

I guess for financial professionals, there actually is a value in a rumor site like Zerohedge *as a supplement* to an otherwise healthy news diet, because it has no reservations about spreading rumors that others wouldn't want to touch but that *might* actually turn out to be true and therefore worth being aware of as a *potential* threat. But if all you read about a topic is Zerohedge, you can only arrive at the conclusion that a total global economic collapse is imminent. Which could be true, but it probably isn't. 

Anyway, sourced facts are one thing, it's how you frame and interpret them, and more importantly, it's about which ones you choose. In this case, they write:

&gt; Expect many more such bailouts as a relentlessly socialist and protectionist Europe does all it can to preserve much needed ~~votes~~ jobs in the critical, if greatly uncompetitive, carmaking sector, and all other sector, soon to follow. *[sic]*

First of all, protecting jobs during an economic crisis isn't really such a bad thing. They extrapolate from the bailout of one car maker to not just the sector as a whole, but even *all* other sectors, and give no indication as to why they think it's uncompetitive. I don't know how they read this chart to come to the conclusion that VW, to use the most extreme example, is uncompetitive, especially when you consider their overall growth on the global market.  
Even if you only consider Peugeot/Citroen, they claim that this is about protecting ~~votes~~ jobs. However, while I'm sure this plays a role, they fail to mention the impact the loss of this manufacturer would have on the French/European economy, especially at a time like this. Think of it as a reverse food chain, where the prey relies on the predator at the top. If they go down, they take their suppliers with them, the small businesses where their employees buy their lunch, and so on. From here it goes back up the chain -- other manufacturers rely on the same suppliers where Peugeot/Citroen buy their parts, they rely on the small business owners that make the employees' lunch to be able to afford their cars, and so on.  
Another factor is that the economic crisis really is an exceptional situation, and that it's to be expected that, when unemployment is high and job security low, people can't afford new cars or delay purchases they would have otherwise made.  
Peugeot may or may not be uncompetitive, but to make this claim you'd have to include pre-crisis performance relative to other car companies in the analysis. This is something Zerohedge could have easily done, but they chose not to. It's an established brand with an existing network of suppliers, vendors and service points. This is easy to lose, but *extremely* difficult to build up again. If they would be competitive under normal conditions, it would make tremendous sense to help them over this period to preserve all this and the jobs that come with it so they're ready for business when the situation improves instead of unnecessarily letting the jobs go elsewhere. Even if they're not, it would still make sense to preserve the value those supply, sales and service networks provide and give them time to restructure and become competitive.

The somewhat cheesy vocal samples break the whole visceral experience. Let the expression of emotion be represented through the music and not through another story of drunken club ramparts.

That being said, I feel quite enthusiastic about the legality of prostitution. Prostitution exists in every country in the world (very likely even the Vatican), but it's certainly most dangerous (for everybody involved) in countries such as Saudi-Arabia, where it is most severely punished.

In Germany, prostitutes can simply call the police if one of their ""customers"" refuses to pay or becomes threatening in any way. They can even get health insurane and old-age pensions.

I don't think this is actually a majority position in Germany, but if I were asked, I'd definitely advise every country to legalize prostitution. (About the majority: this is a total non-issue in Germany, it's never discussed; so I have no idea what most Germans think about it.)

All successful currency unions (at city, state, country or larger scales) have had some mechanism of internal transfers. Universal healthcare, unemployment benefits, rural development and urban regeneration projects are examples of such transfers, it's not just loans or handouts between governments.

Now it might be possible to work without such transfers but then the only options for poorer states is austerity, economic liberalisation or internal devaluation. Between currency unions flexible exchange rates smooth this process out (so the austerity isn't as harsh) but that's not possible within a currency union. Flexible exchange rates do allow some forms of currency manipulation though so they aren't perfect.

Not all the countries that are in trouble have enormous problems with red tape, bloated public sectors or corruption (Greece is the only country with all three). There's many EZ countries with large public sectors and boat loads of red tape that are doing ok.

The parking ticketing in the outer districts? Best thing that happened to this city since 1945. Suddenly you realize that it's possible to have streets which are not filled with parking cars, like a breath of fresh air.

This city is not built to support the egomanics who want to be able to commute from their one-family-dwelling colony to their city-office by car. It's already choking in traffic - how much more cars should there be?

Do you want to do it the L.A. or Shanghai way?

Sie waren im Straßenbild plötzlich deutlich weniger sichtbar als in den Jahrhunderten zuvor. Antisemitismus ist ein paranoides Ressentiment mit einer sehr eigenartigen Struktur. Im Unterschied zum „normalen“ Rassismus geht es gerade darum, dass die Juden in den Augen der Antisemiten ihren Einfluss versteckt ausüben. Dadurch entwickelt dieser Spezialfall von Rassismus aber auch ganz eigene gefährliche Dynamiken, weil der Antisemit das Gefühl hat gegen einen unsichtbaren, übermächtigen Feind kämpfen zu müssen - mit allen Mitteln.

**This is the illogical part!** You live in the outer, work in the inner and decide to do the nice thing and leave the car at home and commute by subway. And the outer parking ticket punishes exactly this!   What kind of sense it makes?

Women are basically the same as men. You figure out what they like, and buy something with that theme. Example: Your grandmother really loves to cook. Buy her an apron. I've seen aprons that look like flamenco dresses that are pretty cool. Alternatively, there's a stall near the top of the market that sells handbag hooks. These are little things that you carry in your bag that you use when you sit down sos that you don't need to put your handbag on the floor (easily stolen) or the table (probably not sanitary) these are super cool, but ensure you don't buy one for a lady who does not carry a handbag. Women who live in a hot climate might appreciate a pretty fan. 

Assuming you are shipping this stuff overseas, a gender neutral way to go is to send a bottle of cava, and some cool Spanish snacks.

The ECSC/EU played it's role but without the background of the cold war I doubt it would have taken off as it has.



What will help keep the peace if NATO is ever disbanded would be the EU and very tight economic integration. But nothing the EU has done would prevent a ""civil war"" within the EU and that's why the EU needs to be built on a solid foundation. A route we're sadly not taking.

Most of the world is free to decide to live in a ""nation"" in which they have a sovereign government with the will of the population, its a basic right guaranteed by the UN...

The EU has become too powerful and beyond its means, thats not to say I'm against those who want to Federalise, just accept some don't and may just want to be friends, not lovers. wanting to trade and co-operate is just as acceptable as wanting to be part of a federal union, one is not ""better"" than the other, just down to the individual nations perspective, bullying nations that don't want to Federalise isn't really helping any cause, its making trading pacts look negative whilst forcing federalisation on people who don't want it thus resent it.

The real solution to the EU and european crisis is to set up clearly defined bodies, that being the EU with a federal government and Euro as the currency, EFTA for nations that just want to trade and the ECC for those who want economic integration without a single currency, likewise the EU as a single entity can choose to co-operate with those organisations allowing trade and freedom to exist in Europe whilst allowing nations to integrate as much as they choose.

It hasn't failed. It's actually a very unclear issue as to whether it ill fail or not. The value has been holding strong ever since the crisis started. All EU and Eurozone countries seem committed to solving their problems and reforming. However there are indeed many problems they need to fix and it's unclear whether they can be fixed.

This is an extremely complicated issue. There is no clue future ahead. So stop acting like you know the future. The only wrong answer is ""This will definitely or **definitely** not happen"".

Dozens more trials of politicians and businessmen are taking place right now (across the political spectrum, so it's not political revenge). Almost every week there's a new politician/businessman arrested: the latest arestee was last week, the owner of a local airline, who [embezzled](http://www.iol.co.za/business/international/romanian-airline-boss-arrested-1.1434976) some money that was supposed to be used for building a highway.

Also the current government canceled quite a few contracts through which the Romanian state was scammed. For instance, the contracts with the ""smart guys"" in the energy sector, who bought electricity from the state-owned hydro plants for less than half the market price and they sold it on at market prices.

Of course, there's still A LOT of corruption (for instance, it's a fair bet that 80% of the ministers get bribes, kickbacks or preferential contracts), but it's gradually getting better than before.

In other words, between developed nations (North-North agreements) or undeveloped nations (South-South) such asymmetry that you claim has been affirmed by ""analysis after analysis"" is rare.

From Directive 2000/43/EC:  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0043:EN:HTML

Another definition: Under Irish law ""discrimination on the grounds of race"" applies on discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, nationality, ethnic origins or national origins ( http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/print.html#sec6 ).

*Another* defintion: UK anti-discrimination/anti-racially-motivated-assaults law define ""racial group"" ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/37/part/II/crossheading/raciallyaggravated-offences-england-and-wales) as:

&gt; In this section “racial group” means a group of persons defined by reference to race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins.

So yes, if an english person were to be motivated to beat up an irish person (in england), then that could count as a racially motived crime.

All these ""but that's not *racism*"" claims just sounds like people trying to play word games in order to continue to do what is essentially racist discrimination.

The courts in the UK can't make law and can't really strike down a law but if laws are inconsistent they have to use their judgement (e.g. we have an old blasphemy law but the Human Rights Act is assumed to supersede it even though the blasphemy law wasn't explicitly revoked).

Because the UK doesn't have a constitution in the modern sense it has no absolute yard stick to measure any law against to be able to strike a law down. However the Human Rights Act (and previous Bill of Rights) also acts like a mini-constitution in that it is assumed to be more primary than most other laws.

Newer laws generally override old laws but if the conflict is subtle they can pass it up the chain. The Supreme Court (previously Law Lords) can decide a particular case based on 'equity' which is essentially fairness but only on a particular case, not on a general point of law.

Sorry I've not a direct source for the last bit, I heard it from a barrister friend (he may not know about other countries laws as well as the UK's).

Most of the loss will have to be taken by the bondholders (mostly banks AFAIK). They will have to take the loss anyway when Southern countries start to default. This should be obvious to everyone involved.

This is called ""private sector involvement"" and was already part of the Greek debt restructuring. Greek debt held by the private sector was cut by slightly above 50%, 70% if you count cost for interests, a €100bn total.

The other day Merkel has brought up a future ""public sector involvement"" (debt reduction of publicly held Greek debt), you can guess how even people from her own party reacted to that suggestion. I'm sure it will have to happen, but not so sure if it's wise to tell the public this while we don't know yet whether more programs will be needed.

&gt;  Then, ideally, this should be combined with some stricter measures within the entirety of the EU to deal with corruption and tax evasion, whether legal or not. One basic measure there would be to have uniform taxation levels within the EU. Right now it's a race to the bottom, all countries compete to attract businesses by lowering corporate tax rates. 

[Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_of_Europe) is famous for this. I'm very much for tax harmonization, but the various national parliaments won't like the idea to give up this sovereignty to Brussels. How would the tax rates be set? I'd like to give the European Parliament this competence, but that would mean fiscal and political integration (which I want). In any case, this would require treaty changes, so any country could block it. Ireland would be far from the only one.

&gt;  Meanwhile corporations and banks are sitting on record high piles of cash.

This is false.

&gt;  There is enough money lying around to have a decent Europe for everyone - it's just not in the right hands.

I'm for higher taxes, especially on the rich, but it's not something individual countries should do while others don't. See ""tax harmonization"" above.

&gt; Next a crackdown on tax havens is in order, and finally some better measures to prevent gov't corruption. Not sure concretely what needs to be done to fix these last two things, but the problems are clear.

And here we have the evidence that you don't know what you're talking about, you're just arguing without any kind of knowledge of education beyond what I've provided for you. That quote actually refers to making trade agreements where 'southern' countries are more likely to abrogate some of their rights under the WTO, specifically to do with services. It doesn't say anything about my premise being 'rare', nor does it attest to any of the rest of the provisions that go into a trade agreement. In fact, if you actually knew anything about the subject beyond merely arguing off of the top of your head, you'd know that. In fact, reading the footnote of what you quotes, it even says

&gt; See VanGrasstek (2011). Looking at the shares of GATS-plus commitments agreed between partners 
of different size, the author finds the initial hypothesis only partly confirmed. The biggest players, the United 
States and the European Communities, at least fitted the expected pattern insofar as they obtained the deepest 
concessions. Roy (2011) also observed, based on a limited sample of RTAs, that the larger trading powers, in 
particular the United States, tended to receive more concessions in their RTAs than smaller participants.  

Further supporting what I said, and with respect to this

&gt;Also, ""universally accepted to a degree""? What is this? Something is either universally accepted or it is not universally accepted. There is no ""universally accepted to a degree"". So is what you are claiming universally accepted or is it not?

What I meant here was that the extent to which there is a difference.

&gt;Please cite something relevant to the UK and EU, two developed regions not suffering from the massive development asymmetry that your studies are talking about.

Well then here you'd have to get into negotiation theory as well, particularly the concept of BATNAs - in which case that completely supports my proposition as well.

First nobody gives a shit about the ottomans, that may as well be up there with Ancient greece, alot has changed since then.

Most greeks are disgruntled towards Germany because of what WW2 did to the country. Just to give an example . . The soviets who lost many many lives . . STILL only lost around 3-4% of there population as a whole. The greeks lost 10% of there total population and most of them were innocent victims such as elderly,woman and children. . . 

WW2 is still buried into peoples mind because Greece has one of the oldest average age of death on earth . . so that means there are many many people  who are 80+ who still vividly remember WW2 and remind everyone.

And now its Germany who is controlling Greece economic future . . to greek people who are fiercly independent . . it just does not feel RIGHT. We do not think Germans are evil, but we do not trust german politicians to make a better greece.

Load of bullshit also by saying ""greeks think there better then everyone"". We just love our history and are proud of it and love to discuss it and marvel in it. Is that so wrong? I bet you think were offending someone  by being proud of it huh?

Greece will get better, right now its not even that bad considering what Greece has to deal with in its history. I think the problem overall is that greek people just feel helpless and this causes shit like Golden Dawn to sprout in the confusion.

E una volta in campagna la usavano per pucciare l'aringa - se ne potevano permettere solo una o due, dunque perchè ce ne fosse un po' per tutti ci si doveva accontentare di polenta 'aromatizzata' al sughetto di aringa.

* funghi: rigorosamente con la polenta morbida, solitamente quella bianca.

* formaggio: lo si mette tra due fette di polenta calde a mo' di panino in modo che si sciolga - funziona particolarmente bene con formaggi salati o stagionati-ma-non-troppo.

* fichi: con la polenta sono la base della *pinsa* (altresì chiamata *puttana*), dolce della tradizione rurale che contiene anche uvetta e che viene cotto nel forno a legna.

There is an argument that maintaining a stable, locally sourced food supply is a security issue rather than just a protectionism issue, i.e. if your country can't feed itself it is less able to exercise self-determination, it's at the mercy of other food producing nations.

Another argument is that farmers look after the land they cultivate which provides a social benefit. I'm not sure I find this very persuasive myself though without the next point.

A final argument is if you needed to ramp up food production in a hurry (due to war, famine, natural disasters, economic problems) it's easier to get more out of existing farm land than to start from scratch. I don't know how true this is myself, it makes sense that cutting down a forest to make farmland would take a while I suppose.

That's not a good trade-off then, if you could get your goods for cheaper, you should do so, there's no virtue in working more for the same benefit.

&gt;There is an argument that maintaining a stable, locally sourced food supply is a security issue rather than just a protectionism issue, i.e. if your country can't feed itself it is less able to exercise self-determination, it's at the mercy of other food producing nations.

That was also invoked back when the British had the Corn Laws and it resulted in ultimate failure. Besides, we are talking about a market where there are a very large number of consumers and suppliers, there's no world monopoly on food production. I personally can't think of any plausible reason why Norway would ever starve when the world already produces so much food and when Norway is so wealthy.

That argument is silly, I'm sure very few of us individuals assure our own food-production, it's the same for countries like Norway, just because they don't produce food it doesn't mean they can't acquire it later through trade.

&gt;A final argument is if you needed to ramp up food production in a hurry (due to war, famine, natural disasters, economic problems) it's easier to get more out of existing farm land than to start from scratch. I don't know how true this is myself, it makes sense that cutting down a forest to make farmland would take a while I suppose.

That does make sense because crops take time to mature and are able to provide nourishment. I still don't know how this could be used as an argument against free trade when there are so many different suppliers of food and because it would be against the self-interest of all of them to, for whatever reason, simply refuse to sell to Norway.",0,1354740466,null,0,false,0,c7bruue,t3_14bkrz,t1_c7bruue,t1_c7brhb8,null,1430588498,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

This is just a tiny bit of the great iceberg that is Spain. On its own it amounts to nothing but it repeats over and over and over until it's so intertwined you don't know where it starts and where it ends.

**EDIT**: to reply to your question more accurately, here's a case. Suppose you start a job at an IT company. Somehow your contract states you work in the metal sector although you don't. You don't mind since your wage is good enough to wave away your worries. 

Suddenly you're fired / contract expires and it's not renewed / whichever circumstance suits you. You are unemployed now and, since you had a legit contract, you paid your taxes and you earned something called an ""unemployment benefit"". 

But here's the problem: remember your contract said you worked in the metal sector right? The benefit you get from the government is calculated on the type of work your contract states and the minimum wage it has assigned by labour statutes. You now realize that if you had the proper sector statute (IT instead of metal), your unemployment benefit would be much higher, or better said, closer to what you used to earn.

So why did the company do that? It's simple: it's cheaper for them and some company can do money laundering via extra bonuses. Most people don't realize it but it's not the company that pays your taxes, but yourself so-to-speak. You earn a gross income which the company deducts a certain amount to pay your taxes for you *based on the minimum wage you earn, before bonuses*. It's the law here and it's required for any legal contract.

You end up without a job, with less benefit than you'd deserve to get by while you find another job and if you have no money you can't sue the company because now it costs *a lot of money* to do so, more than it used to cost.

Citation needed. What about Italians vs. Nordics? Many people might think they are not the same race.
