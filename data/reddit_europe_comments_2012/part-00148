Le monde est devenu un village, et on a découvert l'Afghanistan des Talibans, la théocratie d'Iran, et j'espère qu'un jour on parlera un peu plus de celle d'Arabie Saoudite.

Les opinions publiques mondiales sont en train de se fondre en une seule grande place commune, grâce à internet. En un clic tu peux parler à des fachos, des barbus, des communistes, des pro-Assad, des anti-, etc...

Et il se trouve qu'avant internet, les opinions islamistes extrêmes étaient sous représentées dans les média Français par rapport à leur démographie au niveau mondial. On a soudait découvert tout ça, et il y a eu une réaction caricaturale. Tout d'un coup, l'épicier Arabe du coin (qui, si ça se trouve, est athée comme presque la moitié de la population Française) est devenu aux yeux de Mme Michu un potentiel supporter de Ben Laden (dont la majorité de la population ignorait le nom avant le 9/11) et on a eu un président qui a décidé de faire de ce sentiment un argument éléctoral.

J'ai quand même beaucoup d'espoir pour la suite. L'opinion a découvert les barbus mais également le coté inacceptable de certaines dictatures. Le printemps Arabe ce n'est plus ""juste des sauvages qui se tapent dessus, de toutes façons leur région c'est le merdier"", c'est maintenant des frères et des sœurs qui tentent de renverser un joug avec notre soutien moral et parfois même militaire.

Effectivement, j'ai montré avec quelques exemples ciblés qu'il y avait une différence nette de traitement, deux poids deux mesures.

Quand une bande de branleurs montent sur une église pour y déployer des drapeaux étrangers en crachant leur haine de la France, les armes de guerre à la main, il n'y a aucune interpellation, aucune condamnation, aucun média qui s'offusque (qu'on ne me parle pas des 2 arrestations qui ont eu lieu bien plus tard finalement, elles ne concernaient que la détention d'armes de guerre).

Quand il y a des émeutes violentes avec des membres des forces de l'ordre blessés en quantité, des destructions conséquentes, des crachats sur la France, etc. Là encore, aucune interpellation en conséquence. À peine deux, n'ayant presque rien à voir, avec des condamnations purement symboliques (et encore, on pourrait presque se féliciter que pour une fois, il y ait eu des condamnations).

Concernant les tournantes, la décision de justice laxiste tient purement de l'abject.

Quand les Pussy Riots entrent dans une cathédrale (deux en fait) pour se livrer à une provocation vulgaire et choquante, à peine étaient elles arrêtées que toute notre clique de politicards et des médias les soutenaient et s'offusquaient de leur arrestation (et ce avant même le procès).

Et là, on a des jeunes qui montent pacifiquement sur un **chantier** de mosquée, déploient une banderole et réclament un référendum sur l'immigration et la construction de mosquée, et là ça y est, les politicards et les médias se lâchent pour cracher sur ces vils néo-nazis d'extrême droite, ces résurgences de Brevik en puissance qui viennent de génocider la *race* – carrément – musulmane. Et non seulement la police s'empresse d'en arrêter 4 (dont un qui était allé de lui-même les prévenir de leur action), mais en plus ils s'arrangent pour leur faire passer le maximum de temps en garde à vue prolongée avant de les présenter au juge qui les place sous contrôle judiciaire très strict en attente de son jugement. Ah on les sent bien forts en gueule d'un coup, là ils osent dire les choses, les exagérer, et les réprimer avec courage !

Non mais on se moque de qui sérieusement ? Si quelque chose doit choquer dans mes arguments, ce n'est pas le lien avec des éléments de violence, mais clairement le fait que la justice n'est pas la même pour tous, et qu'en plus la France se lâche sur les Français pour des riens lorsqu'elle n'ose même pas broncher pour des choses très graves dans l'autre sens.

Et clairement, en refusant de voir ce lien, en cautionnant cette justice à deux vitesses, pour ne pas dire cette injustice permanente, vous ne faites que confirmer et radicaliser tous les gens qui en ont ras le bol de ces problèmes et de ces impunités, cela nourri les rancœurs pour ne pas dire les haines, et à terme, cela mènera irrémédiablement à une guerre civile, quoi que les bisounours aient envie de penser.

De même pour tous ceux (gauchistes) qui qualifient d'extrême-droite ou de facho toute personne qui pense plus à droite qu'elle, qui ose se poser des question sur l'immigration et la remettre en question ou autre. Vous n'avez pas l'impression qu'en braquant systématiquement la pancarte « facho » vous coupez court au débat, vous l'empêchez tout simplement, mais en plus vous confortez et radicalisez votre interlocuteur dans ses positions ? Après tout, quitte à se faire taxer d'être d'extrême-droite pour la moindre chose, autant y aller gaiement et l'être à fond, non ?

Un autre point un peu hors-sujet mais pas tellement. Cela ne vous choque pas que [Laurent Ozon se voit harcelé de contrôles fiscaux, URSSAFF, etc.](https://twitter.com/laurentozon/status/260746255142105088) à la limite de faire couler son entreprise personnelle juste parce qu'il est considéré comme un opposant politique ?

Pour en revenir au sujet principal, comme dit précédemment le problème n'est pas la télé mais ce qu'elle diffuse. Et le principe de base d'une chaîne de télé, c'est de faire de l'audimat, donc de diffuser ce qui intéresse les gens.

If we are talking about a significant and global european army then:

Because military and usage of military force is a very sensitive subject and european countries have very different views (based on their history, culture and interests).

As example France and UK are both old colonial power with an extensive history of the use of military power and many interest to defend abroad. .. as a consequence both can afford naturally to send fighting forces when they need it (without risking to offend their national population).

Neither of those country is near to voluntarily release its capacity to act independently from some sort of european decision process (which would come with an european army. The only thing pushing toward this is the increasing lack of funding and the slowly degrading military capacity (relatively to other super powers).

More precisely:
Over the last 3 years french military forces has been involved directly in Afghanistan (big coalition), in Libya (smaller coalition), in Ivory Coast (basically by themselves) and tomorrow in Mali (by themselves again). France ""needs"" this ability. 

Since the 60's France has the nuclear deterrence (alone in Europe with UK), it was relevant at this time to prevent US/USSR from being tempted to turn western europe into a battle playground. It seems irrelevant today, but what about tomorrow ? (Iran and other middle east countries ? China ?). France is not planning to abandon nuclear deterrence (which is probably not appreciated by everyone in europe).

Could those position be kept within some kind of european army ? Probably not.

true,Aevum1,null,null,"Lets see, 

Moving through madrid you can use metro, buses or cercanias which is the commuter train, now prices are 1,50 for bus or 1,50 + 10 cents per station (after 6 stations it becomes a flat 2 euro price), you can change trains without any limit aslong as you dont exit the station, a 10 ride ticket costs 12 euros and is valid for buses and metro (no station limit), and if you´re really going to use the metro and bus alot and even the cercanias you might want to look at the abono turista, it costs 8 euros for a day and 33 for 7 days for inner city or 16 euros a day or 66 euros for 7 days for the entire comunity of madrid, madrid is seperated in to different sections, going form A1 which is central madrid to C2 which is the entire ""state"" of madrid, you wont need to exit the A1 zone for 95% of the things, only to visit places like segovia, el escorial or alcala de henares, these are unlimited use cards but take in to account that they are usualy frozen for 15 minutes after every use to avoid misuse and they can be confistaced by security personal if you misuse them, so getting 1 for both of you is ""use at own risk"". 

The nearest cercanias station to where you´re staying is sol which is directly in plaza de sol. if you plan on going to segovia, toledo, alcala de henares or el escorial you will need to take the cercanias or specific trans from major train stations like Chanmartin (northen central train station) and Atocha (southen central train station), beware that there are 2 atochas on the metro grid, theres atocha which is on atocha street and atocha renfe which is inside the train station, if you want to reac the atocha rail station its atocha renfe, but it dosnt matter becuase they are 5 minutes walking distance from each other. 

 since you´re going to be in chueca (i suppose thats what you mean by chuech) you´re dead center in the city, only 10-15 minutes walking distance from gran via, sol, tribunal, alonso martinez, alcala and maybe 20 minutes walking from the paseo del prado. 

Personaly, explore cheuca first, its very nice, it use to be a junkie ghetto untill the gay community moved in, now its thriving with business, restorants, bards and alot of avangard places, i usualy recomend a ice cream place thats just on the plaza which is one of the best in madrid, also next to the plaza is the san anton food market which is quite nice and has some exotic aswell as traditional cousine, they even have a restorant upstais that i´ve been told that you buy your ingridients downstairs and they will cook them for you,  also consider that by night it becomes a bar hoping-clubbing area so it might be noisy in the thursday to sunday window. 

Now if you get on funcareal street (is right next to cheuca) you´re 5 minutes walking from gran via which is one of the more famous avenues in spain, walking left (coming  from funcareal) will lead you down alcala which has several minsitries and the bank of spain, until you cross with castellana/paseo del prado which is the main avenue of northen madrid. there you have the old central post office  and the prado museum a bit further to the right.

Now if you take a right on gran via you walk down untill the big sweeps sign you have the plaza de callao which is part of busy shopping district and extends down to sol, if you go further down gran via you reach plaza de españa, its a nice small park , if you cross it length wise going towards the left coming from gran via theres a place called templo debod which is an egyptian temple brought brick by brick, by night its illuminated but by day you can go in and theres a little museum inside, 

you can also go to sol from funcareal, you simply cross gran via, theres a street which starts with a large mcdonalds, its called montera, its famous for being full of hookers you walk down that street and you reach sol, from sol you can go up calle mayor and see the plaza mayor, , from there you can go to the san miguel food market which is very touristy and slightly expencive becuase of that, the opera building is near by and you should visit the palacio de oriente and campo del moro which are 2-3 minutes walking distance from there, the opera building is also near by, 

From there you can explore all the old city behind sol and walk to la latina which is a very nice bar and club zone aswell as having many modern and traditional resotrants. 

As for museums, entry is free weekend afternoons, i think reina sofia is free sundays from 10am, and museo del prado has a similar policy, 

near by is the tissen museum but since its a privatly owned museum theres no free pass there, but its still worth a visit. 

Anyways, lets TL;DR this so you can just flag the places on google maps

Places you should visit

- Museo del prado

- Museo reina sofia

- Museo tissen

- Explore Chueca

- Explore area around plaza mayor

- Palacio de oriente / Campo del moro

- Templo debod

- San miguel food market

- San anton food market. 

- Retiro park (has its own museum, pond, street artists sunday mornings, convention center and the only known statue devoted to the devil), take in to account it closes by night,

- Ride the 27 bus, its a bus that goes from plaza castilla to embajadores, but most importantly it goes the entire lenght of the castellana / pasteo del prado, so it passes many landmarks like the start of the retiro park, el prado museum, plaza colon, also passes next to the corte ingles de castellana which is one of the biggest department stores in madrid, 

- Dedicate a sunday morning to the rastro

- Segovia is a nice place outside madrid to visit

- Alcala de henares is also conisdered a very nice university town to visit.

- El escorial which is a palace-town established by a spanish monarch as a spiritaul retreat

- Toledo which is a clasical spanish city which is stongly related to the spanish steel industry and knive making aswell as having both interesting jewish and catholic sites to visit. 

Madrid is a pretty safe city, in the center the most common criminal activity is pickpocketing and small theft, i know it sounds racist but alot of street crime is commited by rumanian gypsies so beware of that, basicly carry your cellphone, ID and cash, try not to carry anything that might be targeted like a hanging camara or easy to open bags, there are more dangerous areas when you leave the city center but basicly theres nothing there you would be interested in.

It's also an elegant way to deal with the growing unemployment due to automatisation, in my eyes. That way, society doesn't have to create new low wage ""mcjobs"" just to reduce mass unemployment.

Ich hoffe Sie nehmen meine Bedenken ernst und finden einen Weg, wie ich meine Arbeit bei Ihnen zufriedener und mit gesteigerter Leistung fortsetzen kann.

Effectivement dans le principe, aucun lien avec la religion. Dans les faits, c'est un repaire à catholiques très pratiquants, de catholiques intégristes, de gens de droite plus ou moins dure et surtout et en premier lieu d'homophobes.

Simplement, ils viennent se donner un voile d'honorabilité en évitant de dire crûment ""les pédés c'est dégueulasse"" parce que ça va tomber sous le coup de la loi. On se rend compte dès lors de l'hypocrisie absolue des propos du type ""on aime tout le monde"", ""on aime la vie"". On trouve les mêmes du côté des anti-avortement qui sont souvent issus des mêmes milieux.

En l'état actuel des choses, le débat pour ou contre se résume au final à un duel de moralité. Et la source de moralité qui est vent de bout contre le mariage homosexuel, c'est la religion avec ce qu'elle a de figé dans des époques révolues.

The nation state existed because it made its members better off against other people.

The empire existed for the same reasons, and so on.

I do not know if a federation of nations is superior but if it's a benefit people will do it.

To be honest, a federation might be just a common empire, though the main argument put forth is that it's not since some parts of it are unified, e.g. economy.

Though at the end of the day, you probably need same language.

I think requiring the same language is brutal - and an extremely unfair and dirty benefit for those that already have the language as their birth language (e.g. English for the English) - **but** universal translators might do it.

Don't laugh, google translate and other 'babel fish' (that was also an online translator) show the way. Give it another couple of decades and language might be no problem.

At Poland-Ukraine border this was solved with special permissions for inhabitants of border cities and villages so they can more easily get on the other side and it works in both ways.

Imagine getting pretty quickly to border and then waiting up to eight hours to be checked on Zoll. I was once in Lwów and crossing border was horrible. The worst part was that the problematic part was because of Polish officers not Ukrainian - we tend to imagine that there is no worse thing in the world than the post-Soviet customs officials. Well, European regulations are worse than them. Without easier passport control on borders, there will be no integration with countries east of Bug. And seriously, I would be delighted to have simple passport control, even if they were obligatory also on Polish-Slovak/Czech/German/Lithaunian border too. Stamps in passport are no problem.

2. Could potentially remove the feeling of shame related to being on social security. One can only imagine the potential positive sociopsychological effects of *that*.

3. Removes the financial incentive to not work. At least here, your social security check and therefore your total net income might easily become less if you started earning money by working. No such problem with basic income: what you earn is not taken away from the basic income.

Also, cheap airline companies would lose a lot of money if they had to retreat from Serbia. I'm willing to bet that this money is greater than that given to a few thousand fake asylum seekers.

And also, there was a similar case where the Czech republic had its visa free travel revoked by Canada because a lot of Czech Roma were seeking asylum in Canada, well knowing that they won't get it, and were just exploiting the system.

Unfortunately, many clichés have roots in reality. I'm not talking for myself, as I do believe I'm quite a nice person to total strangers. There are many people like me. As said in other responses, it's mostly related to customer service, which is most of the time awful, as long as you don't go to a luxury hotel and shit. Even for me, service often seems terrible. I don't go much to restaurants, but it's a general feeling you get even when you buy bus tickets. Let's not assume everybody is like that at work of course, but I do believe americans and other foreigners didn't make that up, at all. Otherwise why would we talk about a ""Paris syndrome""?

Now as for the americans from the french point of view, well, the only one I really knew was a friend's ex-boyfriend. He came from Seattle and he's one of the nicest people I've known. He kept on bullying me with his kung fu stuff and was always on booze but he's real person anyone would have loved - by the way Sean/Shawn/Shaun if by any chance you ever read this it means you're still alive.

NATO does lack vision and purpose, but it is something that they realized as soon as the Soviet threat disappeared. They have been trying to change it's purpose and vision... but it's a very difficult task when everything has to be agreed on by all 27 members. 

On a military level, the different military European forces already train using NATO strategy and tactics so that when they do a joint operation each unit knows how a unit from a different European nation will behave. 

It's very possible that NATO might not survive in it's current shape, but it will more than likely going to be the foundation of an EU joint staff with each country being a different corps level entity or division depending on size of the country. Please keep in mind that this is not likely to happen soon ( 3 -5 years) but probably within our life time.

Basically the Serbian border guard had to ask for guarantees that the citizen would return to the country.

In my opinion, the EU should be doing this instead, because in that case they wouldn't be violating human rights, they would just deny access to suspicious people. The EU also seems to ignore how easy it is to bribe Hungarian border guards. It's well known and almost a habbit that, when passing the border, the bus driver would collect 5-10 eur from each passenger and hand over that money to the border guard. You can see this with your own eyes if you sit on a bus from Belgrade to Vienna, or you can find out by reading any random Serbian forum.

&gt;This book belongs to Sivák József.  
&gt;I bought it on 9/17 1900..........  
&gt;1. With a long stare I look at the silent night sky.  
&gt;Thousands of stars waving from the  
&gt;heights. I'll walk its width its  
&gt;length. There isn't a road that will lead me  
&gt;to you. 2. Oh how far, oh how far  
&gt;is this Paradise^2.  
&gt;On a silent night I'm sitting facing you.  
&gt;3. From your lovely eyes my bliss  
&gt;laughs back at me. The destiny, the chain  
&gt;of love ties me to thee. Your beautiful  
&gt;face bathes in a shower of kisses. Oh  
&gt;how close, oh how close is this Paradise^3;

&gt;swan up in the clouds

&gt;^1 Untranslatable, it doesn't have a meaning, play on words.  
&gt;^2 Literally translates to ""Heaven"", but I found ""Paradise"" to be more appropriate  
&gt;^3 Same as above, except it is meant to be more emphasised by taking apart the compound word ""menyország""  
&gt;and pronouncing the two words, ""meny"" (heaven) and ""ország"" (country, kingdom), separately to give them more weight.

I prefer either the negative income tax model proposed by Friedman or a model where people choose from two options: 1) No basic income guarantee, 2) Basic income guarantee + a percentage point increase in tax rate.

Unlike some people have claimed here, most basic income solutions would actually increase the chance of active participation. At least in Finland people on welfare who want to work seasonally or part time pay up to 80% or more effective tax because they almost instantly lose all welfare benefits.

Basic income guarantee would change that. Let's say it's set at 600€ (Edit: per month). In the current system, an unemployed person who works for a week and earns 500€ would lose their welfare, removing ANY incentive to work short-term. With a basic income guarantee, they would only pay normal tax rate for that short-term job. They would be able to easily increase their available income and gain work experience from short-term jobs, increasing their long-term employability.

It would also be extremely useful for small businesses. If you are running say a cafe where the amount of customers fluctuates a lot. With a basic income guarantee, it would be much easier for the owner to stay afloat during poorer times.

Basic income guarantee wouldn't necessarily be any more expensive than current welfare systems either, since it would at least partially replace them.",0,1351253377,null,0,1351254948,0,c6s0zsh,t3_122xnz,t1_c6s0zsh,t3_122xnz,null,1430244041,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,flyingorange,VOJV,Vojvodina,"&gt;  how is it any more difficult than on any other national border between countries that do not have some form of agreement?

Before Hungary joined the Schengen area, I could travel there from Serbia visa-free. Later as they prepared to join they introduced HU visas, and finally they introduced Schengen visas.

So let's see. Before, I needed: a passport. After, I needed: passport, birth certificate, citizenship certificate, bank account statement from last 3 month and the amount must exceed 1000 eur, proof of permanent employment or if there's no such thing then other guarantees, such as house mortgage, or proof that you study (last year on uni means you get rejected for the visa). What else? Right, sometimes they want an autobiography, written either in English or the local language, sometimes a police certificate that you haven't committed a crime... Some of these papers usually have to have an international stamp called an apostille (1 apostille = 20 eur), they need to be translated, a photocopy must be made...

So yes, it is several orders of magnitude more difficult to get a Schengen visa than to just pass a national border. We are talking about two countries here that used to have very easy travel, **and because of the Schengen treaty**, things got worse. 

There's more. Trade virtually died out. The south of Hungary used to have these huge shoping areas that people from Serbia visited, they mostly died out in the period between 2005-2010. Now there's some recovery as the region is adjusting itself to the new reality, and since 2010 visa requirements were lifted for Serbia.

Seulement, en France on a un réel soucis avec l'Islam, on est d'accord. En france, des musulmans, surtout ceux des cités, se sentent pas intégrés et font des délits, plus que les français ""de souche"", on est d'accord aussi. Y'a un racisme anti-blanc, on est d'accord aussi. Y'a un extrémisme qui se développe, on est d'accord aussi.

Maintenant, est-ce que c'est intelligent, fondé, et cela apporte t-il une solution de blâmer nos compatriotes d'origines mahgrébine juste car ils sont maghrébins et que donc, on aimerait mieux les voir ailleurs? Non. En aucun cas. 

Le moteur de tout ceci c'est qu'il y a un manque d'intégration et une pauvreté croissante qui va se traduire par un extrémisme religieux associé à des activités criminelles qui vont venir embrigader Kader, un jeune de 12 ans très correct pour qu'il finisse en dealer plus très correct et/où voir pire, en terroriste dans un futur pas si lointain.

Le racisme anti-musulman est primaire, bête et méchant. On part de l'idée qu'ils bouffent les allocs, dealent, sont des voleurs etc. Pas faux, y'a plus de délits dans cette catégorie là de français, mais cela s'explique par des problèmes structurels qu'il faut régler : l'intégration pour qu'ils se sentent français et comprennent qu'ils doivent aimer le drapeau français otut en pouvant garder leurs traditions tant qu'elles restent dans le cadre de la république. Ainsi que donner des fonds aux cités et surtout, MIXER avec des français de souche, car sinon y'aura aucune intégration car le racisme anti-blanc est lui plus subtile, c'est juste un sentiment de non appartenance.

Et enfin, bannir l'extrémisme religieux, mais ça c'est de paire. Régler le soucis d'intégration en passant par une mixité sociale c'est non seulement réduire fortement la délinquance dans les cités mais aussi empêcher des futurs Mehrah.

Liberté, égalité, fraternité, ce sont des valeurs que les jeunes de cités ne ressentent plus car la France les a oublié mais si chacun fait l'effort de se mixer en arrêtant d'une part les préjugés mais aussi paradoxalement le politiquement correct, on pourrait avoir des résultats prometteurs.

Now, having had this discussion before, I've had people insist in that a high proportion of the criminality in France is performed by muslims or people from Arabic descent. So what? is this supposed to be a valid excuse to declare a cultural war or something? If people perform crimes, the law should be applied to them with independence of their religion or ethnicity. If there are violations of human rights, there should be laws enacted to prevent them, no matter who does it or why.

&gt;Quand une bande de branleurs montent sur une église pour y déployer des drapeaux étrangers en crachant leur haine de la France, les armes de guerre à la main, il n'y a aucune interpellation, aucune condamnation, aucun média qui s'offusque (qu'on ne me parle pas des 2 arrestations qui ont eu lieu bien plus tard finalement, elles ne concernaient que la détention d'armes de guerre).

Et c'est un peu la seule raison pour laquelle ils pouvaient être inculpés:

 * Escalader un lieu de culte n'est pas interdit. A l'heure actuelle, une église, une mosquée, une synagogue est un batiment comme tous les autres.

 * Deployer des drapeaux étrangers: Pas interdit non plus. Ce n'est pas une dégradation d'un lieu de culte.

 * Cracher sa haine de la France n'est pas interdit. On a un truc super en France, la liberté d'expression. C'est un concept un peu compliqué, je sais.

 * Armes de guerre à la main: Ah, bah oui, finalement, c'est bien la seule chose pour laquelle on peut les juger.

&gt;Quand il y a des émeutes violentes avec des membres des forces de l'ordre blessés en quantité, des destructions conséquentes, des crachats sur la France, etc. Là encore, aucune interpellation en conséquence. À peine deux, n'ayant presque rien à voir, avec des condamnations purement symboliques (et encore, on pourrait presque se féliciter que pour une fois, il y ait eu des condamnations).

Oui, à ce qu'il parait, les gens courent quand la police essaie de les attraper. Je sais pas si tu t'es deja retrouvé dans des manifestations qui ont un peu tourné au grabuge (manifs de Nantes contre le CPE par exemple), mais quand les CRS chargent, ce n'est pas pour arreter des gens, c'est pour y mettre fin. Il y a toujours très peu de personnes arrêtées. Et c'est encore plus dur de reconnaitre quelqu'un lorsque son visage est masqué.

&gt;Quand les Pussy Riots entrent dans une cathédrale (deux en fait) pour se livrer à une provocation vulgaire et choquante, à peine étaient elles arrêtées que toute notre clique de politicards et des médias les soutenaient et s'offusquaient de leur arrestation (et ce avant même le procès).

C'est vrai que moi aussi j'aime bien comparer la Russie et la France. L'arrestation de Pussy Riot était politique. Il y avait énormément de raisons de s'offusquer de cette arrestation, mais ce n'est pas parce qu'elles sont rentrées dans cette église qu'elles se sont fait arrêter. (Bon, faut dire que Pussy Riot avait quand même fait pas mal de conneries, même avant.)

&gt;De même pour tous ceux (gauchistes) qui qualifient d'extrême-droite ou de facho toute personne qui pense plus à droite qu'elle, qui ose se poser des question sur l'immigration et la remettre en question ou autre. Vous n'avez pas l'impression qu'en braquant systématiquement la pancarte « facho » vous coupez court au débat, vous l'empêchez tout simplement, mais en plus vous confortez et radicalisez votre interlocuteur dans ses positions ?

Ein paar Absätze später: 

&gt;Der Bund kennt auch Vergehen, die mit dem Tode bestraft werden können[...]und auch im Militärrecht gibt es die Todesstrafe.

Dann auch noch solche billigen Strohmänner, wie ""in Teilen der USA gibts schon viel länger keine Todesstrafe mehr als in Deutschland"". Als ob das irgendetwas daran ändert, **dass** es heute in den USA die Todesstrafe gibt.

Die gesamte Argumentation ist absurd. Er behauptet zwar, dass es ""in den USA"" keine Todesstrafe gibt (ist ihm zu allgemein), schreibt aber gleichzeitig, dass es die Todesstrafe nicht nur in 76 Prozent der 50 Bundesstaaten gibt, sondern auch, dass es die Todesstrafe im Bund selbst und im Militär gibt.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; ..independence would, amongst other things, enable us to remove WMD's from Scottish soil. The UK's nuclear arsenal is located 25 miles from George Square in Glasgow (Scotland's largest population centre) and seven of the UK's disused nuclear subs are sitting rusting away in Rosyth dockyards less than 12 miles away from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.

As usual, a bit of SNP spin here -it's a bit [misleading](http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/MicroSite/DES/WhatWeDo/SDP/). Seven of the UK's twenty seven decommissioned nuclear subs are at [Rosyth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosyth_Dockyard) and are actively maintained, not ""rusting away"". [The fuel has already been removed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-15801357) from the reactors, and the only radioactive parts that remain are localised to the subs reactor working parts. The MOD is in the process of organising disposal of the reactor before the subs are broken up and recycled. Campaigners in [Barrow-in-Furness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Dreadnought), in England, have been petitioning to have one of the subs moved down to become a museum piece when this work is complete. 

&gt;  That would be morally reprehensible at the best of times, but when Westminster is currently enforcing cuts (with more to come) affecting the most vulnerable in society this is an abomination.

Nuclear weapons are a funny thing. An independent Scotland would benefit from having a friendly, nuclear armed rUK to the South, without actually having to foot any of the bill for maintaining the weapons, whilst simultaneously getting to feel all morally superior and smug about not being a nuclear armed state. It's kind of like when Iceland get held up as an example of a state without a military, when in fact they have a treaty with the United States that guarantees American military protection.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I have no legal basis, part of the problem in the Euro crisis is the shoddy legal framework the Euro operates in, e.g. The Stability Pact wasn't worth the paper it was written on and for all the political independence of the ECB its options are very much limited by its mandate.

But, you just think others should pay! Well, if someone is to pay for healthcare of people who need it, why Greece? There are countries who are having it much worse than Greece. 


In what other areas do you think the EU or the Eurozone should just ignore the legalities, don't follow any rules etc? If one pays for Greece's healthcare, why on earth not Estonias social services (they are poorer than Greece), and certainly Romanias school system needs more help, not to mention the Romanian hospitals. 


What makes Greece so special that they should have their healthcare paid for? Other countries have greater needs than Greece. Why is Greece so unique that they need stuff paid for them, while other countries have to struggle? 

&gt;The numbers just don't add up, Greece cannot afford to pay back its debt never mind the loans from the IMF and EU, e.g. Greece just had a surplus of 1.6 billion Euros but has a 110 billion Euro EU-IMF loan (at low but non-zero interest rates) as well as large amount of sovereign debt.

Well, first, why did Greece take those loans? If they can't pay them back, they can always declare bankrupcy.Besides, the loans are given to a much lower interest rate than Greece would get on the free market, so taxpayers are *already* subsidisng, but you just want more and more. 

&gt;If you don't want transfer payments to the Greeks and maybe a few others (by either writing off their debt or just giving them money) you pretty much condemn them to falling out of the Euro.

Greece are the ones to make that choice, if the cancel their payments for example - *not* other countries taxpayers who doesn't want more of their taxes to go to Greece's health care for example. Don't try to pin this on anyone but the Greeks.

* It's way too expensive: In Germany it would cost around 1 tln/year (1000 EUR is a number floating around here). It would be financially viable only if it replaces *every* state transfer mechanism. This in particular means pensions! You can figure out yourself how well that would be received. In addition to that you'll need to raise VAT even more (some say ~50%). You might guess how much 1000 EUR will give you in that case.

* It would not reduce bureaucracy:  It might reduce the number of bureaucrats, but even then: it would probably be the first incident in recorded history where a peaceful reform actually reduced the number of employees in a bureaucracy.

* It's grossly unfair: you would hand out that money regardless of whether it's needed or not. So at least 20-30% of it would be wasted on people who earn more than enough to sustain themselves.

* It would most likely increase inflation: you'll need to raise currently lower-paid jobs significantly, as there is no incentive otherwise to take those jobs. But since *someone has* to do them (in particular nurses, service personnel etc) the prices for the services will go up significantly - thereby rendering the whole ""it's enough to live on"" premise moot since most services will be too expensive for people with just that income.

And that it automatically functions as some sort of automation/productivity tax if done right.

No. My position is that there's two choices (well maybe a third but it's the same result as the second):

* Pay and keep Greece in.
* Don't pay and implicitly force Greece out of the Euro. The third option is to not pay and request the Greeks leave the Euro.

I'm also trying to put the specific Healthcare issue into the context of the current crisis because I believe the former to be a consequence of the latter.

I don't think either option is the right or wrong choice. The problem as I see it is that everyone's trying to have their cake and eat it. If the Greeks default, that's their choice to make. If the Eurozone cuts Greece loose they have the right to do so. If the Eurozone wants Greece in they have to pay, not grind it under foot.

&gt; Well, first, why did Greece take those loans? If they can't pay them back...

I don't think the Greeks have been angels or anything. Of course it;s wrong to take on loans you can't pay but hey had a choice between exiting the Euro or taking whatever deal they could to stay in.

&gt; Don't try to pin this on anyone but the Greeks.

The word isn't used any more in daily use (probably confined to poems now) since it's now ""arcod"".

Most of his errors are also in words that use a double letter which admittedly I have no idea if they once were correct, but I don't find it impossible that they were in the Hungarian used a 100+ years ago. (since the OP doesn't know who the writer was he also doesn't know his age, but I think we can agree that József is over or around at least 18 when he wrote that based on the topic, but he could also have been 50, which would put him back to the 19th century and languages can change in the time between then and now).

However it also completely plausible that he isn't Hungarian. I would rule out him being German because ""Sivák"" doesn't sound like a German name. Then again it is definitely not a Hungarian one because traditional Hungarian names denote your origin or in cases your trade/trait, i.e. ""Magosi"" (someone from Magos) or ""Kis"" (someone who is small) and if it ends with ""y"" instead of ""i"" than it represented nobility. Since the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy existed between 1867–1918 and it included Czechoslovak territories it might be that his name was Hungarianised (totally made that word just up) and since the official language was Hungarian he might have learned it but not perfectly.

Or, just keep going. Somehow you are implying that the latest health crises is making the situation unbearable, they will have to leave, or the Eurozone/EU will have to pay. Why? Why can't the Greek live their lifes on the same level as the Estonians, or the Romanians? I mean, if they want to leave, sure, but implying that the standard of living has become so low that they are being forced to leave, is saying a lot of what standards of living the Greeks are expected to have then. Why should they live better than Eastern European countries, particularely if some of them support Greece? 

&gt;If the Eurozone wants Greece in they have to pay, not grind it under foot.

They *are* paying. The loans are subsidiesed, by taxpayers. What you are implying is that they should pay, so that Greece, God forbid, not falls to the Estonian or Romanian living standard. Again- what makes Greece so special that they are above that? Why are they so unique that they have to be sponsored not to live their lives like some Eastern European countries? 

&gt;Of course it;s wrong to take on loans you can't pay but hey had a choice between exiting the Euro or taking whatever deal they could to stay in.

Or, one could balance budget, stop bribes, start paying taxes, make reforms, wait a few years until one was actually qualified etc.....Greece are not the only ones that shouldn't be in the Euro, Italy and Belgium for example shouldn't be there either, but they do not need help, so it is not as bad. 

&gt;To be honest there's plenty of blame to go around.

France taking part in NATO is pretty recent (2009) and controversial (in France), it's an example of how unnatural it is perceived in France to lose military freedom. 

I don't think that it's credible to expect EU-wide consensus when it comes to the question of sending troops to be killed to overthrow some dictator who decided to be funny with our uranium supplies.

When it comes to military influence its not only about peacekeeping jokes (UN style), but the ability to seriously military threaten to help your diplomacy. A military force depending of an European consensus could just not bring that.

&gt; our own interests first in the form of a combined military rather than having to rely on the USA 

While on many things EU and US are competing as soon as you reach the military question you cannot make this divide anymore. When the question is to use military power to protect resources (think oil) or to make preemptive strikes (for security) UK and France are much closer philosophically to the US than to Germany, Poland or Czech Republic (and Scandis/Fins i would guess).

If it finds a game to be too extreme it can deny a rating and the game can be sold to 18-year-olds but the BPjM, the actual authority on the ""index"", can then investigate and in case they find it reasonable ""ban"" the game, which means that open advertisements for it, display in stores or online become illegal. You can still buy these games but only after showing ID and asking for it, the stores usually just keep them in the back. All this is mainly about sex or gore in games.

The other issue here is the fact that Germany bans displaying or glorifying Nazis and their symbols. This is handled by a department which protects the constitution, the Verfassungsschutz. Generally Nazis and symbols can not be used for undue entertainment but only for history or art. That's why all games involving Nazis get a facelift before being released in Germany. Nazi symbols are replaced, so are names and possible glorification. Unless one were to make a highly artsy and historically accurate game this would be a big problem. Playing as a German WWII soldier in a video game sold for profit would generally sound all alarm bells and the public/political outrage would cause a ban in no time. Once a game is banned by the Verfassungsschutz it is illegal to advertise it, show parts of it publically, sell it, import it and a couple other things. I have 99,999% confidence that any game made for profit making you play out the Nazi side would be banned, no matter how tasteful it may or may not be, this is a political issue, not necessarily one of regulation.

As I wrote, it's difficult to talk about ""the pension system"" in Germany, as we actually have a few of them. I suppose you mean the ""public"" pension system (Rente). The state employee's system in particular most likely can't be overhauled, at least not in the bounds of the basic law, because the state is supposed to care about the state's employees in a manner that is way beyond the duty to normal citizens. 

As for the normal system, sure you can make changes, but they will draw costs *now* while you give all current pensioners their 1k EUR, but you can reduce/eliminate the benefits only for future pensioners (would be a violation of trust, also against the constitution). So this is utterly not financially viable for the next 30-40 years. 

At which point the whole baby boomer problem is also in the way out and you could finance your pensions any way you like again.

PS: I for my part don't really believe in private funds. You - as a society - can't really ""save"" money for the future, at least not reliably. I mean, all you save is a bunch of ones and zeroes (or paper, if you're old-fashioned).

In each case, the current generation will have to take take for both their children and their elderly. The only question is how the money they earn is distributed. And as I said in another post, the proposed scheme is unjust, not viable and harmful

When I talk of pensions I mean both Renten and Pensionen. To be honest I don't like that there is a distinction between the two at all and I'd advocate introducing a united pension system for everyone in any case. Why do people make a big deal out of the fact that the state has to add tax money to the ""normal"" pension funds because they don't generate enough income on their own anymore but nobody complains that state employee pensions are completely tax funded? But I digress. I agree with you that the basic income isn't a perfect solution for every current problem, but personally I think it's a nice vision and mid- to long-term goal for our society.

true,blipos,null,null,"Nationalism is a tricky question, i think that it's a shortcut to mix up national sovereignty and nationalism. To illustrate that i would say that France is probably willing to renounce some more sovereignty for the purpose of building a stronger european union but not ready to renounce it's military freedom as we are perceiving that as a necessity not only to protect our integrity but europe's one as well.

Let's go for one example to illustrate that, look at the nuclear deterrence question. For many european the perception of it is that it is an odd and unnecessary remain of a past time. 

But the reality is that France would happily share the burden of the nuclear deterrent with other countries in Europe (its costly and could be dangerous strategically) and everyone in France went apeshit when the brit talked about stopping their nuke program.

French view is that it' is a very costly insurance against potential surprise (middle east) in the futur.

The french nuclear deterrence is now in reality a potential european deterrent (can be seen through the analysis of the french nuclear doctrine which do not define clearly vital interest).

So what is perceived by many as an odd sign of the french arrogance and nationalism is in France seen as a necessarily evil for EUROPE as a whole that would be happily shared.

So don't tell me I know less about the ""threat"" that Islam is to Europe.

Now Switzerland is one of the few countries that has an islamophobic article in its constitution (ban of minarets). So, I know a thing or two about Islamophobia. Switzerland has a minority of 4.5% Muslims, 56 % of those hail from Ex-Yugoslavia (mainly: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania and Kosovo... NOTE: THESE COUNTRIES ARE IN EUROPE, FFS!), 20% from Turkey (mainly Alevite and Kurdish), 4% Northern Africa, 3% Lebanon and the rest from southern Africa and Asia). The majority of these people are known not to adhere to a strict interpretation of Islam, you couldn't tell they are Muslim if you saw them on the street. And they certainly wouldn't greet any Salafi/Wahabit rule with a warm welcome.

Doesn't matter for the Swiss electorate, because Islamophobia runs strong in them, they vote for banning minarets (because they are symbols of power, yadayadayada). Since all that jazz we have a more aliented muslim minority, a new muslim association that pretends to speak for muslims in Switzerland, promotes a Salafi interpretation of Islam, all whilst having no contact with the base of muslims that actually live in Switzerland whatsoever.

For all he knows he's 100% French (though of course, if it were possible to track down his ancestry to before the 10th century, he may have Italic, German, British or Scandinavian ancestors - but since the Viking settlements up to the 1950s - hence for a thousand years - the ethnic background of French people stayed grossly the same).

Anyone can get to call himself French since the term has no meaning anymore because citizenship is thrown around like fliers. Otherwise, the minimum amount (in addition to being bread here) is having at least one family line which is French up to time immemorial. That is, further than genealogy can tell. Of course, one can't really differentiate between different degrees of ethnic French origins, so one has to settle with three distinct ones : 0% French origins, partly French in origins, and 100% French (""Français de souche). I'm not saying one is superior to the other in any way, I'm saying ""Français de souche"" are clearly more French for the simple and obvious fact that they are the INDIGENOUS French people.

true,olddoc,BELG,Belgium,"Your link points to the unemployment insurance system in France, not the socialized healthcare scheme. Legal residents are immediately entitled to healthcare, no money invested in the system.    
    
Let me offer you my own first hand experience with the Belgian system (which is similar to the French). My wife is a non-EU citizen. When she arrived in Belgium, she was not entitled to *any* unemployment benefits until she had worked two years full time. Until she found a job, we had to live on one wage, and zero cents were added to my wage. (A lot of people think non-EU immigrants can arrive here and are immediately entitled to unemployment money, or the spouse's wage reflects having 'one extra person at burden'. But these people are wrong. I have six months of living on one wage to show as evidence.)     
    
But my wife could immediately obtain a healthcare card, and she was immediately entitled to the same healthcare as I was. She didn't get sick ever (nobody gets sick just for the fun of experiencing the socialized healthcare, right?), but it paid for the dentist!    
    
Edit: Just to add: I therefor second radaway's observation that ""This doesn't seem like the typical European health system to me. [...] seems like what they had was more of a bastardization of the American system.""

Et que ce serait il passé si l'Etat n'était pas intervenu? A aucun moment? Le piratage sûrement aurait fait de bien plus gros dégâts (puisque disponible chez tous les marchands), y aurait une éducations bien meilleur sur le pouvoir des clients encore une fois.

Mais je maintiens que la concurence aurait pu percer. Tu sous-estimes ô combien les start-up perdent toutes leurs capacités à cause des impôts et des innombrables restrictions sur le marché (déjà présente au début de microsoft), qui ont aussi freiné leur arrivée.

Je pense que les monopoles privés sont une création étatique pour la simple est bonne raison que l'Etat instaure de très très nombreuses restrictions qui empêche les concurents de percer, maintenant ainsi les monopoles.",0,1351283316,null,0,false,0,c6s8eli,t3_11r1b1,t1_c6s8eli,t1_c6rtskc,null,1430247606,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

Good sir, you seem to think that this problem is one that has only occurred during the 20s. The moral decline of America and the influx of the Irish actually has been occurring since the mid 1800s. 

Ever since the potato famine occurred in the 1840s, they have been arriving in our country in greater and greater numbers. Initially we met them as we would a guest, but it is in these times that our graciousness has been worn out. It is the twilight of the ""Irish problem"", not the dawn. We've been under siege for quite some time.

It is no coincidence that temperance - a movement largely fueled by the difference between our earlier lighter alcohols and Irish Whiskey and the level of sin and adultery associated with them- began to grow in popularity in the late 1800s.

&gt;Paris has ethnic ghettos nowadays, cars are torched every New Year there and regular French people are getting increasingly afraid. 

Ah yes, I recall with great detail the Irish slums that currently inhabit great cities like New York and Boston. They are truly a blight on our nation, spreading every kind of filth you can imagine: disease, drunkenness, crime, and corruption.

&gt;There are varying differences between ethnic groups and cultures, no matter how hard you try to close your eyes and cover your ears.

I take great offense at this. As our population has been slowly overtaken by the Irish menace I have become acutely aware of the differences between cultures.

Our culture - one of reservedness, moderation, and our lord Jesus Christ can hardly be compared to the rowdy, drunken and lazy cultures of the Catholic hordes brought here by ship. It will be death of our society. Already men take their paychecks straight from work to the saloon, spending their money on Whiskey and irish whores while their families starve.

They even vote as a block, threatening to unseat any upstanding man who we may put into place in our government. It is this unity in malfeasance and sin that makes them such a threat to our nation.

Basic income is not for the case of massive and persistent unemployment. It should rather work out the other way around: 
a) still nobody gets to be rich without doing anything.
b) by eliminating a lot of the risk of making decisions (going to school instead of starting to work at 15 years; going to university, and maybe *fuck that bachelor's degree, I'll stay for more*; change jobs more easily; open your own business...)",0,1351288370,null,0,false,0,c6s9o1s,t3_122xnz,t1_c6s9o1s,t1_c6rt4tc,null,1430248215,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
true,donkey_lz,null,null,"&gt; The prosecution made it crystal clear all along that their case was about poor risk communication; it was built on an accusation of giving out ""inexact, incomplete and contradictory information"".

To a scientist (well, ok, someone who at *one* point wanted to be a scientist... I then realized I actually want a job in the industry), *this* looks stupid.

There are things a lot more predictable than earthquakes for which you will get wildly contradictory answers from scientists. I saw it happen routinely; I *did* it routinely, and I still see it routinely as an engineer. If you ask six people ""Is there going to be an earthquake tomorrow?"", you will get six answers, all different, all of the type ""It's very improbable"". Which is what the scientists did.

The question that should have been asked by the civil authorities was in the form ""Given this shakes, can we be 100% sure that there will be no earthquake?"". Anything different from this is a gross misunderstanding of how science works, particularly in the case of seismology.

This is also the way everyone asks questions when there's a matter of life and death. If someone working at Boeing in a decision-making position bases his approach on ""Will this window be blown away from the plane at 20,000 feet?"", that will most likely be the last question he asks before clearing his office. The correct way to go in these circumstances is ""Can we be 100% sure it will *not* be blown away?"", closely followed by ""How sure can we be, if not 100%?"" and an assessment of the options. And honestly, this is a question that a graduate student with some knowledge of mechanics can answer reliably, unlike anything related to earthquakes.",0,1351288396,null,0,false,0,c6s9o9y,t3_124hch,t1_c6s9o9y,t1_c6s307i,null,1430248217,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"Bon, avant de répondre point par point, petit pas en arrière. Je pense comprendre les points de bases sur lesquels on n'est pas d'accord. Tu pars du principe qu'un système qui émerge tout seul est forcément le système optimal. C'est assez facile à justifier car quand on laisse faire, y a quelque chose qui émerge, et dans pas mal de cas, spécialement dans les cas où on laisse faire aujourd'hui, ça donne un résultat qui marche pas trop mal.

Passer de cette constatation à la généralité selon laquelle la ""main invisible du marché"" est une entité omnisciente qu'il faut suivre les yeux bandés est par contre une croyance pas du tout validée par les observations, qui montrent plutôt sans équivoque qu'elle est fausse. Y souscrivent une petite partie des néolibéraux Français, la majorité des neocons Américains et des libertariens.

Il nous a fallu des siècles, voire des millénaires, pour apprendre en tant que société les cas dans lesquels la compétition libre et non faussée était un bon outils, les cas même où elle était indispensable, et ceux dans lesquels elle est dangereuse. Tu as dit toi même que certaines missions doivent dépendre de l'état : Police, justice. J'imagine que tu seras d'accord pour l'armée aussi. Un peu d'histoire (ou simplement de géopolitique moderne) devrait te convaincre que l'éducation, si elle n'est pas obligatoirement publique, ne peut pas être privée sans une régulation importante. Dans d'autres domaines, on en débat encore aujourd'hui : les banques, les réseaux routiers et ferroviaires, les centrales nucléaires, le réseau de distribution d'électricité, la poste, l'eau, etc...

On a également appris que la concurrence libre et non faussée, si elle était plutôt douée pour répartir les ressources envers les personnes productives, souffrait de quelques problèmes : l'émergence de monopoles et la concentration des capitaux.

&gt; Mais reste que ton exemple était très très spécifique, je peux pas vraiment justifier ça comme ça.

J'ai donné deux exemples : Véolia et Microsoft. Dans le cas du premier c'est une ressource vitale qui est contrôlée, dans le deuxième, c'est pas vital, mais les petites entreprises qui boycotteraient Microsoft se retrouveraient avec un fort handicap par rapport à celle qui collaborent avec. C'est un exemple typique de dilemme du prisonnier : si tout le monde se met d'accord sur une stratégie, ça marche bien, mais si un seul trahit, il peut enfumer tous les autres. Et l'histoire montre que c'est rare les cas où un petit malin refusera de se saisir d'un tel avantage. 

&gt; Dans ton exemple tu as cité l'intervention de l'Etat qui a obligé microsoft à arrêter les conneries. (résultat au final pas top top, il n'y a plus que 3 vraies concurents...)

Les différents états qui auraient pu faire quelque chose, extrêmement libéraux, n'ont strictement rien fait. Seule l'Europe a imposé une amende pour une petite sous-partie de ses pratiques anti-compétitive, 5 ans après les faits, et cette amende était largement inférieure aux profits engendrés. C'était tellement ridicule, que Microsoft s'est fait condamné une deuxième fois pour la même chose avant d'arrêter. Je pense que ça les a quand même empêchés d'aller trop loin, mais c'est justement un exemple qui montre que le laisser-faire, ça ne marche pas. 

Depuis que Bill Gates est parti, par contre, cette boite périclite. Apple lui pique des parts, ils ont loupé le coche des smartphones et des tablettes, ils sont sur la pente descendante. A moins qu'ils ne trouvent leur Steve Jobs, ce monopole est en train de se désagréger et grâce à des organismes publics comme l'IETF ou l'IEEE, internet est resté à peu près un bien commun. 

&gt; Tu sous-estimes ô combien les start-up perdent toutes leurs capacités à cause des impôts et des innombrables restrictions sur le marché (déjà présente au début de microsoft), qui ont aussi freiné leur arrivée.

Je suis auto-entrepreneur, je suis en train de monter une startup. Si j'arrive à avoir le statut de jeune entreprise innovante (et c'est plutôt facile) la plupart des impôts sauteront. Plusieurs aides existent, plein de prêts à taux zéro, et il y a des projets de recherche semi-privés dans lesquels l'état propose de payer la moitié du salaire d'un employé. Si tout se passe bien, les deux premières années, je paierai en tant que société un impôt négatif.

Je sais que c'est une idée très répandue que les entrepreneurs sont écrasés de charges et d'impôts. Il faut savoir également que c'est un mensonge. Il y a des restricitions stupides, il y a des gâchis, de la mauvaise gestion, de l'incompétence à tous les niveaux, mais il n'y a pas de formule magique qui permettrait à toutes les missions de l'état d'être remplies si on supprimait les organismes publics qui s'en chargent.

&gt; Je pense que les monopoles privés sont une création étatique pour la simple est bonne raison que l'Etat instaure de très très nombreuses restrictions qui empêche les concurents de percer, maintenant ainsi les monopoles.

Moi j'ai donné plusieurs exemples. Tu en as de ton coté ? Explique moi également comment on fait pour percer avec une startup dans un domaine où un concurrent peut faire du dumping et des économies d'échelle pour t'empêcher d'entrer. 

Pour déloger un gros concurrent d'un marché, il faut souvent des investissements que seule une boite de taille similaire peut faire, à moins d'être protégé et aidés par l'état.",0,1351320573,null,0,false,0,c6sfkdb,t3_11r1b1,t1_c6sfkdb,t1_c6s8eli,null,1430251052,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

I could spend my time on the beach, traveling, partying, playing games all day etc. I used to think that when this period of unemployment starts (it was planned) that I'll be bored pretty soon, but it never happenned. You should try it sometimes :)

One of the reasons why I moved to Hungary was its flat tax. Here I pay as much tax as everyone else, and still the system works. As someone who earns above average, I get to keep more money than someone who earns below average. And I think this is fair, since I worked hard to get to where I am. Let me write this in bold, **I worked hard, I'm not earning more because I'm ""above average"" by birth, my skills had to be developed through hard work**. 

The extra money I earn will be put to good use. There was, I think, a video just a few weeks ago, which explained that it is the middle class which creates the most jobs, contributes the most to the economy, and not the upper or the lower classes. Right now I'm middle class. If you tax me to give money to the poor, that money will be less useful than had it stayed with me. They will probably spend it on food, which is already subsidised (meaning if you spend more on food, more money will be spent by the society). I will spend it on a new washing machine. The washing machine industry, which isn't subsidised, will keep on runing, new jobs may be created etc.

Btw. please don't turn this around saying that the poor should starve because of my washing machine, no they should not, of course they should have money for food. But let's say, instead of eating meat every other day, they would afford to buy it only once a week. And if they want a better quality of life, they should work for it and teach their kids valuable lessons, like don't expect money to fall from the sky.

On avait des problèmes d'organisation terribles : une semaine sans rien faire, suivi de trois projet d'un coup, ce qui te donne quatre heure de sommeil en moyenne pour faire les choses bien; notes qui arrivent des mois après l'examen et qui sont clairement ""arrangé"" pour facilité le classement des gens qui voulaient faire une thèse; impossible de la joindre par mail ou par téléphone pendant plusieurs semaine d'affilé, ce qui a couté une opportunité de stage a plusieurs personne, etc...

This is exactly what is required.

The EU has a price as well as a value. Find a way to protect the single market from caucusing within the (soon to be) fiscally converged euro-core, in order that Britain (and other extra-euro countries) can remain sovereign nation-states within the EU, and we’ll have a future together we can talk about.

http://www.openeurope.org.uk/Content/Documents/PDFs/EBAsafeguards.pdf

A nation is either: 1. a broadly sovereign state within the EU 2. a functioning part of a larger sovereign entity as the euro-core will become

The only other alternative is being a dependent adjunct to a larger sovereign entity. A Sanjak, in short.

Our position on europe never mattered pre-crisis because even post Lisbon he EU was composed of broadly sovereign entities, however……. a euro-core that consolidates fiscal power around a democratic mandate is going to end up caucusing decisions and imposing predetermined policy positions on extra-euro members, i.e. a dependent adjunct to a larger sovereign entity.

This cannot be sustained, as it is responsibility without power, so find a way to make it work or we will end up in EFTA

Gladstone understood how fundamental is the power to tax and spend: “The finance of the country is intimately associated with the liberties of the country. It is a powerful leverage by which English Liberty has been gradually acquired … It lies at the root of English Liberty, and if the House of Commons can by any possibility lose the power of the control of the grants of public money, depend upon it, your very liberty will be worth very little in comparison …That power can never be wrenched out of your hands… That powerful leverage has been what is commonly known as the power of the purse – the control of the House of Commons over public expenditure – your main guarantee for purity – the root of English liberty. No violence, no tyranny, whether of experiments or of such methods as are likely to be made in this country, could ever for a moment have a chance of prevailing against the energies of that great assembly. No, if these powers of the House of Commons come to be encroached upon, it will be by tacit and insidious methods, and therefore I say that public attention should be called to this.”

* We could create a basic income guarantee that replaces unemployment benefits and minimum wages. This approach has two benefits. 1. Nobody will be disincentivized to work because the job is paying less than the unemployment benefit. 2. Companies won't be more inclined to hire less people because workers are more expensive for them. 

* We could also try to further strengthen unions so that workers have more bargaining power. 

* Just like many nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), we could get rid of all tuition fees and give all students a monthly grant to help cover their living expenses (the monthly grant would of course not be needed if there is a basic income guarantee). This way, we have less low-skill workers and, instead, get more people who have a higher education. Soon, all low-skill labor will be done by machines anyway. Universal access to higher education is also important to make sure that all ambitious and talented children have the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their social background. 

* Raise taxes for top earners to finance these programs (inb4 libertarians/ancaps throw a fit)

* Get rid of the FDP.

&gt;It didn't become a democracy that long ago either.

It is certainly older than Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Hungary and on par with Portugal and Spain. Are they comparable to he Weimar republic too? 

&gt;Estonia does not have 25% unemployment and nor is its GDP contracting by 7% a year. There's more to economics than a straight GDP comparison, and right now Greece is in the worst economic situation in the EU by far

Well, the fact that Greece may end up on the same level as the Estonians (oh, the horror) or Romanians, doesn't make them Weimar Republic material. Also, Greece still have some social security, healt care etc that certainly was not present in the Weimar republic.

&gt;Whether they are right or wrong to perceive it this way, most opinion polls show Greeks heavily resent their creditors in a similar manner.

The fact the Greeks *think* that they are being treated in a similar way, doesn't mean that they are. I am sure that Golden Dawn sees themselves as defender of Europe and Greece, doesn't mean that they are. Should we always act after the persons/organisations belief (well, you think you are being unfairly treated, of course you will not have to pay back your loans - if that is the case, then the Swedish government is treating me very unfairly) or what might be the reality.

There are of course as well the other dissimilarities, like proportional reperesentation, loosing a World War, article 48, the general fight between communist - non communist, the recent revolution in Russia and the hyperinflation (which I think was one of the most harmful things).

I think the point was that the Serbs inside Croatia and Bosnia, in their own held territories, were armed with tanks, rocket launchers etc, badly outgunning the Bosnian state's own army, certainly at the beginning of the war. How come? The Yugoslav army, encouraged by Milosevic, largely took the Serb rebels' side, and even when it dissolved handed over the overwhelming majority of its arms and equipment to the Serbs. The result was that the fledgling Bosnian state was soon reduced to a small rump as the much better armed Serbs overran, terrorized and ethnically cleansed swathes of majority-Bosniak and majority-Croat inhabited lands.

true,silence_hr,CROA,Croatia,"&gt;It means that the fact that the Croatian army did not shell Serbia does not rule out the Serb civilian population being attacked.

There was no Croatian army at the beginning of the conflict. Some reinforced police units with nothing more than AK-47, in some cases not even that.

&gt;Similarly, the weaponry of the Serbian army has no protective effect in territory which they do not hold.

Serbian army was **attacking** Croatian cities. Tanks were rolling from Belgrade to Croatia .... planes were taking off in Serbia to attack Croatia ... artillery units fired from Serbia into Croatia.

Serbs basically cut Croatia in half and were holding around 35% percent of the territory which they ethnically cleansed.

Idea of Croatian forces attacking Serbs is ridiculous ... when the war broke out we had no heavy weapons to use against them.

&gt;There's no need for false equivalence, as seems to happen in Serbia, but equally I doubt the conflict was solely between good guys and bad guys.

There were bad guys on all sides, but facts are facts. Croatian volunteers didn't go into Serbia and killed civilian population there, Serbian volunteers came to Croatia to do so. Croatia forces never bombed Belgrade (capital of Serbia) while Serbian forces bombed Zagreb (capital of Croatia) ..... and so on and so on ......

If we want to talk about these issues, let's talk about facts. Sure, there was surge in Croatian nationalism which followed surge in Serbian nationalism and situation was really shitty, but we were in no position to attack anybody.

true,Seefor,DENK,Copenhagen,"&gt; With the predatory lending to Greece and other countries, do you really think it's a good thing to for a country to join the EU today?

No one forced Greece to take those loans. They just exploited that the Euro meant low interest rates for them. And of course no Greek wanted to ruin their own nation, but unfortunately I think that there were plenty of Greek politicians who were short-sighted and corrupt enough to only care about their own reelection rather than what was good for the country in the long-term.

But the Euro was flawed, yes, since there was no financial union also. A monetary union cannot go without a financial union, as this crisis has shown. Hopefully this is something that they will fix in the upcoming European Council meetings.

But the advantages that an EU membership gives in terms of increased trade, mobility for one's citizens etc. are obvious and easily measurable. There is a reason that countries have been lining up to join the EU. Noone has been forced into what will soon become a union of 28 countries. 

And mind you that EU membership does not automatically mean adopting the Euro, even though a new member country has to promise to adopt it at some point. 

&gt; Like it or not, but there are also a lot of people seeing the EU expansion as a type of occupation of nations

That is not logical, since EU membership can only be approved by a democratically elected parliament and in most countries also by a referendum (see Croatia as the most recent example). When a country joins the EU it is the will of the people of that country.

&gt; Eastern Europe will never exceed the living standards of the West while inside the union, no matter how hard they work or how much they effectivise their politics.

There is a term called convergence, which means that the poorer economies will grow quicker than the rich economies and thus the wealth differences will in time converge. Maybe the poorer nations will never catch up completely, but it is certain that they would never be able to reach the same kind of political stability and economic growth outside of the union.",0,1351342471,null,0,1351357036,0,c6shdwh,t3_125ya6,t1_c6shdwh,t1_c6sgwif,null,1430251913,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,almodozo,null,null,"A friend of mine was among those who returned to the Krajina after Operation Storm.

She was around 14 years old when things in her town quickly took a turn for the worse. The local ethnic Serbs did not like Croatia's declaration of independence, as was their right. However, they also quickly armed themselves, and started terrorizing anyone in the town who was not fully Serb and on their side. My friend wasn't even Croat - she was of mixed origin, half-Serb, a quarter-Hungarian and a quarter-Croat. Their family simply identified itself as ""Yugoslavs"". That wasn't pure enough for the local Serb ethnic cleansers, and they fled at the last moment with just what they could carry. Everything they left behind was burnt, all their belongings. When I met her, the things she got emotional about was the family photos that were all burnt.

She spent the next four years, from 1991 to 1995, being sent from one place to another in rump-Croatia. Refugee housing, temporary housing. For a while, she, her parents and her brother were separated from each other. She later said she felt as if the most innocent years of her life, her teenage years, were robbed from her.

She had not identified as Croat before. After that experience, she was fiercely Croat. Identity by experience, rather than blood.

Their house was ransacked and burnt. Then a new family moved in, refugees themselves, Serbs from Bosnia. Those people meant no harm. They repaired the house, even built an extra porch. But they probably also forced themselves to never wonder or ask whose house it was they were now living in.

Operation Storm restored the status ante quo, to put it formally. The armed Serbs were defeated, the Croatian army took back the town. The Serbs had razed the Catholic church to the ground, my friend showed me when she was guiding me around, and mined the forests so we could only take one path out of the town and back when looking for a view over the town. But the Croatian army had left the Serb Orthodox church was still standing, just like they should of course. There were still Serbs living there, though many or most had now in turn left for Serbia, to refugee housing of their own. There were many Croats who had returned, with a fierce nationalism; Croatian flags hung everywhere, and houses were being rebuilt.

She moved back, but didn't stay long, going to university in Zagreb. But her parents now lived there, and she went back most weekends. They were in their old home again, but none of their old belongings were there anymore. The family kept apart from the louder new Croat nationalist residents, some of whom had never actually lived in the town before and instead came from Bosnia. They didn't identify with those guys. But they were thankful for the Croatian army to have gained back the town. 

My friend hated the Krajina Serbs who had terrorized all non-Serbs, driven her family out and burnt everything that once belonged to them, when they had done absolutely nothing wrong. Just because they weren't fully Serb enough and weren't willing to take up arms against the new Croatian state. But she didn't, obviously, hate the family that had apparently lived there in the years in between. Those were probably also just victims. I mentioned to her that I'd seen the new porch had a date inscribed in it, something like 1993, and she acknowledged that it had been added while they weren't there. She didn't know what had happened to that family, and frankly, it wasn't her first concern: whoever they were, the way she probably saw it, they'd taken an ethnically cleansed family's house, by choice or necessity, and it seemed like a matter of course that they'd have to move out again sooner or later once justice on that count was restored. 

That's Croatia though. Unfortunately, few of the Bosniaks in Bosnia-Herzegovina who faced the same fate as my friend ever got to go back. Their houses are still either abandoned or falling apart, across the Republika Srprska - any bus trip across the country will show such burnt hulks. Or they are inhabited by Serbs - sometimes refugees who had in their turn been forced out from elsewhere in the country, but often also just former neighbours who took the opportunity to grab some extra buildings and land. Yes, this happened to ethnic Serbs in some of the Bosniak-held territories too. But there are many, many more Bosniaks than Serbs who were killed or ethnically cleansed and never got to go back. And their terrorizers still deny that they did anything wrong, and they have their Republika Srprska entity government and Republika Srpska media to keep telling them so. The few escapees who did try to return, mostly older people who don't care about ostracization as long as they can just be back home, often faced intimidation and violence upon return.

Suffering abounded and still abounds among Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks alike as a result of the war, and there were war criminals on all sides. But there is no equivalence between what the Serbs wrought, at the explicit encouragement of a Serb government which was sitting in Belgrade fanning the flames of hatred and violence without having to fear that the war would come to its own country (and indeed, they got away with it all until years later when the Kosovo war broke out), and what people on the other side did in defense and revenge.",0,1351342716,null,0,1351398870,0,c6sheqg,t3_125ya6,t1_c6sheqg,t1_c6sgjo7,null,1430251926,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,Shamalow,IDF,Ile-de-France,"&gt;Passer de cette constatation à la généralité selon laquelle la ""main invisible du marché"" est une entité omnisciente qu'il faut suivre les yeux bandés est par contre une croyance pas du tout validée par les observations, qui montrent plutôt sans équivoque qu'elle est fausse.  Y souscrivent une petite partie des néolibéraux Français, la majorité des neocons Américains et des libertariens.

A condition, et c'est fondamentale, que tu éduques tous les acteurs du marché bien entendu :). Et pour ce qui est des obeservations sans équivoques, étant donné qu'on a jamais vraiment eu d'état libéral dans le monde je ne vois pas trop de quoi tu parles... C'est qui les néocons américains par contre?

&gt; Tu as dit toi même que certaines missions doivent dépendre de l'état : Police, justice. J'imagine que tu seras d'accord pour l'armée aussi.

J'ai dit que je ne savais pas, c'est différent. J'hésite entre anarcho-capitalisme et état libéral. Dans le premier cas police et justice sont gérés de façon complètement différentes. Avec une sorte de compétition entre polices privées qui fait qu'au final les polices qui resteront en vie seront celles qui sont les moins violentes car les moins chers. La justice elle est gérée par un système de tierce partie dans tous les contrats qui seront passés. En très gros c'est ça et en ce qui concerne l'armée... Bah y en aurait presque plus cas très cher pour absolument rien du tout, on en aura un semblant avec les polices privées. Ca pose la question du droit du port des amres pour tous and co, bref c'est là ou je bloque un peu avec cette idée, faut que je réflechisse encore j'imagine:). Pour l'état libérale c'est le principe de Locke il me semble avec en plus l'idée que la monnaies est elle aussi privée, seul reste justice, police et armée à priori (mais la aussi je ne suis pas super informé).

&gt;l'éducation, si elle n'est pas obligatoirement publique, ne peut pas être privée sans une régulation importante.

Oui mais la différence c'est que cette régulation importante devrait pouvoir être fait de façon privée, par différents organismes qui notent les écoles sur différents critères. Il se peut même que ce soit des associations qui gèrent ça. Ne pas sous-estimer l'importance de ces dernières.

&gt;les petites entreprises qui boycotteraient Microsoft se retrouveraient avec un fort handicap par rapport à celle qui collaborent avec. C'est un exemple typique de dilemme du prisonnier : si tout le monde se met d'accord sur une stratégie, ça marche bien, mais si un seul trahit, il peut enfumer tous les autres. Et l'histoire montre que c'est rare les cas où un petit malin refusera de se saisir d'un tel avantage. 

Donc à la place obliger l'entreprise en question à respecter une concurence libre. En faisant ça tu t'assures qu'aucun concurents à microsoft ne pourra percer. Je crois d'ailleurs que c'est sur cette idée qu'on était partis à l'origine. Le fait que l'Etat intervienne ici ça donne un énorme avantage à microsoft au final. Parce que ce dernier allait faire une connerie et allait perdre à long terme la plupart de ses clients. Mais l'Etat l'a rappelé à l'ordre et tout est allé mieux.

Pour le dilemme des prisonniers, si la demande devient suffisament forte (et ça aurait pu être le cas sans l'intervention de l'Etat) la concurence aurait pu émerger car les producteurs secondaires auraient pu produire 100% autre chose que microsoft. Bah oui, après tout les producteurs sont dépendant de la demande, pas du reste.

&gt;Je suis auto-entrepreneur.

Ca explique la qualité de tes réponses :).

Mais je suis désolé, en tant qu'auto-entrepreneur tu n'a pas d'employé. Et ça change beaucoup de choses. Et en ce qui concerne les aides: dans le cas d'un état libéral les prêt à taux zéro serait proposé par les banques qui ont un interêt à ce que tu restes chez eux.
Pour la subvention et la coupe d'impôt ayant de la famille qui essaient de l'avoir, non ce n'est pas si facile que ça, et c'est très loin d'être suffisant. Quand tu embauches tu as toujours de très nombreuses charges à payer pour le salaire de tes employés.

&gt;Je sais que c'est une idée très répandue que les entrepreneurs sont écrasés de charges et d'impôts.

Mais parce que c'est VRAI! Et surtout en France. Et tien preuve en est le taux de chômage actuel. Honnêtement sans toutes ces charges le taux de chômage serait très proche de zero.

&gt;Il y a des restricitions stupides, il y a des gâchis, de la mauvaise gestion, de l'incompétence à tous les niveaux, mais il n'y a pas de formule magique qui permettrait à toutes les missions de l'état d'être remplies si on supprimait les organismes publics qui s'en chargent.

Si, parce que tout ce que tu viens d'évoquer provoquerait la faillites de toutes les entreprises les pratiquants permettant au final de ne laisser que celles qui font bien le boulot, ou plus précisément celles qui satisfassent le mieux le peuple.

&gt;Moi j'ai donné plusieurs exemples. Tu en as de ton coté ? Explique moi également comment on fait pour percer avec une startup dans un domaine où un concurrent peut faire du dumping et des économies d'échelle pour t'empêcher d'entrer. 

Toutes les milliards de restrictions faites sur la bouffe qui empêche quicquonque de percer le marché devant les coût alors induits. (tout est fait chez kraft foods, néslé ou danone en France). 

Toutes les restrictions sur la construction d'immeuble, et là y en a, t'as vu le prix d'achat  qui en résulte. 

Toutes les restrictions sur l'emploies, permettant ainsi à toutes les grosses boîtes (alias monopoles) de n'engager des gens qu'en stagiaire en échange du nom de la boîte sur leur CV. Profitant ainsi à ces boîtes par rapport aux petites qui sont obliger de payer leur employé car n'ayant pas de nom à leur proposer.

Toutes les restictions sur les drogues permettants à certains cartels très armée de conserver leur monopole.

Toutes les restrictions sur les médicaments où les examens se révèlent en vérité pourri, pas fiable et très cher (ex récent du médiator). Notament aussi en ce qui concerne les médicaments, LA restriction, qui fait qu'on attend 10 ans d'utilisation aux US avant de valider quoique ce soit en France. Permmetant ainsi aux industrie pharmaceutique américaine et médicale d'avoir un énorme monopole. (ne me cite pas nos industrie pharmaceutique française, y a pas meilleur exemple de monopole maintenu par l'Etat)

&gt;Explique moi également comment on fait pour percer avec une startup dans un domaine où un concurrent peut faire du dumping et des économies d'échelle pour t'empêcher d'entrer. 

Ouai c'est pour ça que free n'a jamais pu percer... a non! Désolé ça a percé ;)

&gt;Pour déloger un gros concurrent d'un marché, il faut souvent des investissements que seule une boite de taille similaire peut faire, à moins d'être protégé et aidés par l'état.

Pas forcément, c'est à ça que servent les investisseurs aussi (alias actionnaires). Si tu es capable d'en réunir sufisament tu peux créer ta boîte concurente. Il suffit juste d'inspirer sufisament la confiance et d'avoir bien réussi une entreprises précédentes par exemple.

true,JamesRachels,null,null,"I'm not sure if I really understand what you mean. The basic income would not be paid by a factory but by the government. It would replace welfare and unemployment benefits. Regardless of which country would introduce the basic income guarantee, it seems obvious to me that only the citizens of said country would receive it. If the French government decides to increase child-care allowance, for instance, then that doesn't mean that the French government has to give money to German or Italian families as well. That would be absurd. 

&gt;[A basic income guarantee (basic income, citizen’s income) is a proposed system of social security, that regularly provides each citizen with a sum of money unconditionally. In contrast to income redistribution between nations themselves, the phrase basic income defines payments to individuals rather than households, groups, or nations, in order to provide for individual basic human needs. **Except for citizenship**, a basic income is entirely unconditional. Furthermore, there is no means test; the richest as well as the poorest citizens would receive it. The U.S. Basic Income Network emphasizes this absence of means testing in its precise definition, ""The Basic Income Guarantee is an unconditional, government-insured guarantee that all citizens will have enough income to meet their basic needs."" Basic income guarantee is not to be confused with Guaranteed minimum income, a similar concept where the income that is received may be conditional upon participating in government enforced labor or other conditional means testing. Basic income garantee is distinct in that **the only requirment for receiving it is to be a citizen of the country.**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_guarantee)

I can speak Serbian and Slovenian, and have been to the Czech republic ~5 times and also talked with Czechs and Slovaks in many different occasions.

So whenever people ask me where I'm from, I say Serbia since this is true, and I really don't like explaining history. In perhaps 70% situation I got a friendly response (the other 30% were neutral), and by this I mean they told me ""hello my Slavic brother"", ""Kosovo is Serbia"" and ""hooray we're all Slavs here"". Of course, in these situations I didn't want to confuse them and explain myself. My family name sounds Slavic so I can give that if they ask my name. Once while hitchhiking I had a really ridiculous situation with a Slovak truck driver telling me how it would be great if Serbs and Slovaks bordered each other, and it's too bad there are those pesky Hungarians in between.

Now really, I never heard any such talk from Serbs. They don't care so much about panslavism. Now again, I only have a personal opinion and no scientific proof, but by looking at some of the (19th century) stuff kids read in Czech-slovak schools, it's not hard to understand why they feel they are connected to other Slavs more than to other nations (when really, they culturally have more in common with Hungarians and Germans than with Serbs).

Conversely, taxes are paid by all residents, not just citizens.  Citizenship is about the right to vote, that's about all.

Now I believe there's a special provision in EU law to close the ""social shopping"" loophole: something like you're entitled to social protection (except perhaps for basic medical care?) only if you've been in the country for $n years and/or have been born there and/or have worked there more than $k years in the last $m years and/or have paid taxes for at least $l years, or something of the kind—I don't know the details.

The fact is that it *could*, not that it has.

&gt;Age of the democracy is not the only factor here. It's all a strikingly similar combination of circumstances.

No, it isn't. Then you have to factor in *all* the circumstances, not just cherry pick the ones you want. If one can cherry pick, I can compare it to almost anything, from the fall of the Roman Republic, to the French Revolution, to the Spanish Civil War.

So, please, if it so strikingly similar, could you please answer me where is the:

* The recently lost World War

* The *one year* old democracy

* Russia/Soviet  union and the ""red threat""

* Hyperinflation

* The different attempts to seize power

* Article 48

* Proportional representation without limits

* The Versaille treaty - massive repayments to the winners of WWI

* Forbidden to build an army/re-arm in accordance with the Versaille treaty

* Stab in the back legend

For something to happen, a revolution, huge change etc, there usually needs to be a lot of factors to be working together. I don't know if that is happening in Greece right now, perhaps, although it doesn't strike me as such, to me it seems that Greece want their old life much more than change. What I do know is that most of the factors that worked towards making disastrous results of the Weimar republic (Hitler) are not in play here. The fact that the middle class feel despair, doesn't mean that there's a new Weimar Republic.

1. Serbs in Borovo are afraid the Croats will ""kill them all"" so they set up barricades
2. Croats fire rockets at those barricades
3. Serbs invite volunteers to protect them from Croats
4. Croats send armed policemen to Borovo
5. Serbs kill armed policemen

Point #2 is when a weapon was first shot in the war, it was 3 rockets fired by the Croats. What you quoted was point #4, it happenned only later.

And rockets != AK-47. Where did those rockets come from if the Croats were unarmed? According to you the Croats were defending themselves, so why did they fire the first shot?

Here, from the article you linked yourself:

&gt;  In an effort to defuse the situation, the area's moderate police chief, Josip Reihl-Kir, agreed that the Croatian police would not try to enter Serb villages without the explicit permission of the local Serb authorities; in return, the Serbs agreed to dismantle barricades.[9][10] However, as he later complained, his efforts were seriously undermined by the actions of Croatian nationalists who stoked the tension.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;No it doesn't, but we are comparing political mood and culture here, not whether what is actually happening is directly comparable.

Well, then it's a stupid, very stupid comparison. They might as well compare it to the fall of Rome, Russian revolution or anything. How was the mood there? 

If one does make a comparison to the Weimar Republic, it is not because it was for example a cultural golden age (which it was), then one makes comparison to Paris in the 20's or something. 

No, one makes a comparison with the Weimar Republic because the Weimar Republic was one of the causes for WW II. Otherwise, why not compare with the Argentinian middle class, the fall of the peso, and the economic collapse. No, they want to say something - if we do not do something, that unless we act there will be a WWIII? A Europe wide collapse and a war? I don't know what they are trying to say, but I do think the Weimar comparison is stupid. Apart from everything else I have mentioned, Greece is in fact to small of a country to cause the devestation Germany did.

&gt;Social security and healthcare in Greece are under immense strain, but again this is not about a direct comparison of material conditions, it is about the political mood.

I know it is under strain, but from a level that certainly *not* existed in the Weimar Republic. 

&gt;but again this is not about a direct comparison of material conditions, it is about the political mood.

The fact that the middle class feels dispair, doesn't mean that one is on equal terms with the Weimar Republic. What about Argentina`? Latin America? Russia? 

&gt;You miss the point by comparing with Eastern Europe. No matter what the GDP of a country happens to be, if it experiences 25% unemployment and 7% contraction then things are very bad indeed.

Again, Argentina. One doesn't have to compare with the Weimar Republic, there are a lot of other countries who at one time or another has had a dwindling middle - class, and feelings of despair. 

&gt;There appears to be some confusion here. I am not Greek.

Much better, he believed, to contain socialism within national boundries.  All the easier to drive a wedge between the classes.  Voila, national socialism - but socialism most definately. 

The term fascist comes from a word describing a bundle of sticks bound together, symbolizing the many weak coming together to create strength, and was frequently used as imagery by the labour movement - again, the left wing. 

The scumbags in germany put their political leanings right in their parties name - and even a quick skim of the Nazi's founding documents will show that the bulk of their policies were directly in line with other socialist groups - and still are with those of today.

They were refered to as right wing originally only by Marxists, as they saw fascists and nazis as being to their right, but that only means slightly to the right of an extreme LEFT-WING movement.

Really, don't give these 7% nuts the attention they're seeking. Greece is a country of 11 million people. Their action squads are what, a few hundreds? The noise surrounding them is made bigger than it really is. The proper way to deal with them is by:

a) Putting a stop to illegal immigration. Greece has a huge coastline and Turkey couldn't care less, they just send everyone over. Strengthen Frontex, scrap Dublin II and remove Turkey's EU candidate status until it behaves properly.

b) Agree for a European Social Contract about the poor people in all European countries. There should be a minimum standard of living, having priority over a country's other obligations. Unused EU funds could be finally put to good use. Starving people would vote for the one that is feeding them.

Although some regions of German (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, for example) are a bit Nazi, many Nazis believe that as long as you don't 'mix' with German girls (""Rassenschande"") and only study here, that's ok. Although I highly doubt they will be giving you a hard time or anything, that's just what many of them believe.. (sourde: German Nazi Internet forums) However, this is just the Nazis' opinion. The actual possibility of being pestered by Nazis is veryveryvery low - actual, violent Nazis are probably less than 0,1% in the entire East) Generally, students don't care at all about your skin color, NPD is only strong in rural and poor parts of Germany.

Generally, it may be a bit hard to click with Germans, at least that's my perception with non-european students here. Make sure to ask your fellow students to learn with you or go with you to the canteen and then ask them if they want to go to this and that university party. 

Americans are ok. Some Germans don't really like you guys and think you're stupid and violent (dbecause or your gun laws and wars). Also, I sometimes get the impression there is a different culture of discussion. We like to discuss loud and a lot, but that doesn't mean we don't like each other. We also don't give up our opinions easily. 

Regarding German girls: You being *African*-American is of no concern I'd say. However, there might arise some problems because of you being an American, because to cultural differences

My personal feeling about Americans (who tried to hook up with me) was, that I considered them a bit creepy, mostly because they became touchy too fast and directly asked me wether I had a boyfriend, also I felt as if they were trying to 'protect' me, which was a bit intimidating because it felt as if they wanted to 'own' my body. 

So what you do in approaching a girl is basically treat them as friends, talk to them about anything (including religion and politics) and listen to their opinion. If you're on  a party you can spend them a drink, come closer and if you talked some time you can ask if you can kiss her, etc. proceed to ONS. If you want a relationship and don't really know them yet, you should first invite them to a gathering with some friends and then afterwards ask them for cooking with you or go to a concert or such.

Fascist policies were never blatant until about circa 1935. There were massive clashes between left and right at that point of time in spain for example. World was paying more attention to that.

Moreover, what would have happened if UK and France had attacked Germany in 1935 or 1938? You may want to look into who broke Nazi Germany's back and at what cost. Who the fuck would have wanted to pay the price that Russia paid?

This idea that France and UK could just walk into Germany to stop Hitler completely ignores what happened during 1930s.

And on top of that one cannot forget that the poor jews hoped to find sanctuary in USA/UK, only to be told a stoic 'no' by the same nations. History is complicated. Hitlers rise to power was not so simple. And Greece will not go down that path.

Europeans were not concerned when Greece was being bankrupted in the name of EU solidarity; a solidarity where Greece does not even have control over its own monetary policy.

1. Being a student in germany is awesome! most universities offer free bus and/or train tickets in a certain city/state when you enlist. living is cheap for students in most citys. watch out that you dont pay too much rent, because some landlords abuse the fact that foreign students are often not fluent in german. you should not have problems to meet new people, because most students are pretty eager to get to know people from other countries.

2. dont know

3. since i live in west germany, i cannot be entirely sure. but i think no. occasionally there is something in the news where nazis beat up someone, but it happens not too often. at least not more often than the  ""weekend too much booze"" beatings. since you will probably be surrounded by other students/friends when you go out, i think you will be absolutely fine. if you hear an occasional racist comment just ignore it. it really is a small small percentage of germans that still believe in that nazi bullshit, almost all germans are friendly to foreign people.

4. what i have witnessed: some people will brand you as that ""stupid, ignorant american"" prototype which im sure you know what im speaking of. always depends on how you behave. on the other hand, people experience americans to be extremely friendly. and you always seem to be around other people. us germans like to be alone sometimes, while you americans always tend to have people around you. not my opinion, just what i have witnessed :)

and one thing: be careful when doing drinking games/competitions with germans. drinking age starts at 16 here. in addition the drinking laws are/were pretty relaxed, so many started with beer at the age of 13/14, so we have a ton of experience/dexterity ahead of you. i have often heard from colleagues that american exchange students cant take as much as we do and tend to get totally blackout wasted most of the time.

No it's not. Stop pretending. Both countries are NATO members, both have been at peace for, what, centuries?

The plants are very expensive to build and even pro nuke people don't typically want one in their back yard.

The plants we have now are inefficient. We don't use up nearly enough of the uranium.

While these are legitimate points, they are solvable. It's probable that, had there not bean a massive stall in R&amp;D, we already would have. The problems are also often exaggerated, making nuclear seem more dangerous than it is. Many arguments assume that removing Nuclear plants is a net gain in terms of the environment and safety, but this is only true if you ignore the loss of life and health and environmental risks connected with oil, coal and gas plants that will take their place.

Arguing the bad points of Nuclear has become irrelevant outside of science and engineering circles do to the fact that the real dangers are significantly less than what people imagine them to be.

Any country that wishes to make good, rational decisions about energy must first demistify nuclear power and this means pointing out the positives, dispelling the misconceptions and only at the very end explaining the negatives.

For those that can remember there was a ludicrous time when Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, fuckers that they may be (especially McGuinness), when an actor had to provide a voice-over, word for word, because they weren't recognised as a political movement but a terrorist one. 

Then there was the Downing St Declaration.

Not only did the Downing St Declaration recognise that there should be a resolution by referendum if Northern Ireland ever wanted it, it allowed the political wing of the IRA to be treated separately from the IRA itself.  Suddenly people could hear Adams and the Machiavellian McGuinness (I have issues with Martin 'Bloody Sunday' McG,) and the important thing is that it brought peace.  A distinction was made between the militants and their political wings.

Britain, Australia, France and Germany, all didn't want to label Hamas in Palestine a terrorist organization.  France and Germany ultimately had to go along with the EU consensus but the UK, with its veto, and Australia as an outsider, opted out of  choosing to identify that Hamas's militant wing, a terrorist organisation which they recongnised, the Al-Qassam Brigades, was not indicative of 'Hamas' the political wing. The same process that allowed the political wing of the IRA to come to the table and for negotiations to be had.  Negotiations which lead to the IRA announcing a process of disarmament for diplomacy.

Label a group as a whole a terrorist organization and the only avenue they have is further militancy.  Recognise a political aspect and they have the choice to go down a different path.

A short explanation: last year, at the apex of the bond spread crisis, where things seemed dire, Berlusconi resigned and we got a 'technical government'. This government focused on taking debt under control through austerity measures, with the support of BOTH the right and left moderate wings.

Fringe parties instead went to the opposition, while a newish party started gaining a lot of votes: a stand-up comedian turned opinion leader founded a new party based on the core idea of ""send all those fuckers packing"", proposing a selection of candidates via CV, short mandate limits and stuff like that, so that all the 'old guard' politicians would be ruled out. He got a LOT of audience and managed to place a mayor in an important city.

Since last year there has been a MAJOR wave of corruption and embezzlement scandals, mostly (but not exclusively) involving right wing people in high places, resembling at times the famed bunga bunga parties. The right wing parties have taken a nose dive in the polls, so much that the second highest party is the 'fuck-em' party, according to several polls.

This general feeling of hate towards politicians and their privileges is starting to have an effect, so all parties are scrambling to find new, younger people to capture the disenfranchised voters. 

According to the current polls the next elections should have a pretty strong left-wing majority (albeit with a drift toward the center) and a sizable component of 'fuck-em' people. These are seen as wildcards with no political experience, so nobody knows what to expect.

Why are those countries labelled with all sorts of lame puns and demeaning catchphrases yet Germany wasn't 7 years ago? Why do those countries have to follow Germany's recovery model yet Germany wasn't pressured to follow any model put forward by other countries back in 2005?

To put it very simply: it's a wide case of bullying. The EU has found its scapegoats to attain its agenda and it will carry on. But make no mistake every country that is not Germany (and France somewhat) has a particular label evidencing its propagandized weakness with the goal of weakening the very notion of state.

These labeling tendencies are a cultural thing. It helps Germany (and France), reknowned chauvinists of Europe, to carry on their millenia-old imperalist diatribes. And this cultural thing they got just helps the economic view of Europe the EU has. In the near future, people will see their nations fall apart economically and culturally to such a degree that Merkel and Barroso will seem like great role-models for a 'Unified Europe'. 

Time will come when Romanians will be asked after a long saturation of prejudiced labeling: 'you don't want to be a gipsy, do you? Then support the take-over of the EU.'

Please correct your article. In Romania in order to start the impeachment process the constitution of the country was raped and then beaten to death. The Romania constitution has a serious design flaw in that it allows the party with the majority to call for an impeachment (for solid reasons) an infinite amount of times at no cost (such as holding new parliamentary elections if the impeachment fails) so theoretically impeachment referendums could be held in Romania every single month for 5 years until the majority gets the result it wants.

Moreover to impeach the president he has to have commitend ""grave acts against the constitution or treason""... both of which he did not do. Therefor in Romania the majority had to break the law (the constitution) in order to start a referendum and they will most likely do it again next year because there's nothing stopping them.

Don't forget that communism and dictatorship only ended 22 years ago (almost 23 now). Democracy is still crap because the same politicians who were part of the communist regime were and are in control. Everybody is a relative of everybody and the country is run by background interests. 


While corruption has been lowered it's still existent. ex. pretty much destroyed CFR (the state railway) but state universities are no better at all for instance. You don't buy the book of the professor, fuck you, good luck with your studies. Don't want to take a test, just hand over €100 and get a pretty good grade (my room mate does this). *edit: but you still got to buy the damned book*


Lower and lower-middle class Romanians also don't give a damn. They don't like to work and are uneducated. The xenophobia I see in some comment sections is incredible. They hate the Hungarians, they hate the gypsies, they even hate each other (Romanians from Transylvania hate Romanians from Moldova and Wallachia and vice versa). 


Going back to stupidity, if a Romanian doesn't pay for a ticket on a tram or a train the other passengers will fucking try to protect him from getting caught or simply won't give a damn because fuck the system right? They don't realise however that these are partially run from their taxes. Effectively they don't realise that they are protecting the person who just indirectly robbed them and made things shittier for everybody because the company won't be able to afford a new modern carriage for instance. 


Another thing is that Romania compared to Italy or Greece is both culturally and economically less significant. That's the awful truth. We and Bulgaria are the poorest nations within the EU and while Bucharest was the Paris of the East at one time, communism came and turned everything into crap, severely limiting arts, education, economy, politics...bloody everything.


We could go on and on about it. I'm not saying you shouldn't be mad, because fuck them, it's unfair for the people who didn't do anything wrong, but things are still shitty around here. Don't ignore it. Things are shitty there too, look at exactly Italy and Greece, but they can at least bash Romania and Bulgaria in the press so people there will worry more about gypsies camping outside their house than Greece going bankrupt and the EU dumping a crap load of money into a situation that might have been avoidable.

Définis moi un état libéral. Il faut quoi selon ta définition ? Il est vrai qu'une absence d'état et un territoire en situation de paix civile ne semblent jamais avoir existé en même temps dans l'histoire. Il y a peut être quelque chose à en déduire ?

&gt; C'est qui les néocons américains par contre?

Néo-conservateurs. Les gens derrière Bush et Ryan qui considèrent, souvent littéralement, que la main invisible du marché est la main de Dieu et qu'on doit donc lui faire confiance. 

&gt; Avec une sorte de compétition entre polices privées qui fait qu'au final les polices qui resteront en vie seront celles qui sont les moins violentes car les moins chers.

On a eu ça au moyen-âge. Si la police est privée, personne ne peut empêcher le racket. En privatisant la police, tu recrées un système féodal. Ceux qui gagnent dans ces conditions sont les plus violents. Regarde en Grèce : la police déserte certains endroits et c'est les milices nazies (réellement nazies hein, elles le revendiquent) qui font régner ""l'ordre"" : quand y a un problème quelque part, elle dégagent les étranger et incendient leurs logements. Et elle font ça gratuitement.

&gt; faut que je réflechisse encore j'imagine:)
Réfléchis, mais lit aussi au sujet des organisations passées, des systèmes économiques, de ce qui se passe pendant les révolutions, les périodes de chaos, etc...

&gt; Oui mais la différence c'est que cette régulation importante devrait pouvoir être fait de façon privée, par différents organismes qui notent les écoles sur différents critères. Il se peut même que ce soit des associations qui gèrent ça. Ne pas sous-estimer l'importance de ces dernières.

Qui choisit les critères ? quelle légitimité des différentes associations ? Si l'Opus Dei propose de mettre des moyens énorme pour prendre le contrôle des manuels scolaires, on réagit comment ? 

&gt; Donc à la place obliger l'entreprise en question à respecter une concurence libre. En faisant ça tu t'assures qu'aucun concurents à microsoft ne pourra percer. Je crois d'ailleurs que c'est sur cette idée qu'on était partis à l'origine. Le fait que l'Etat intervienne ici ça donne un énorme avantage à microsoft au final.

Il faudrait que tu m'expliques comment tu vois ça, parce que là tu es en train de m'expliquer qu'on alimente un feu en jettant de l'eau dessus...
L'État, en interdisant des fusion, empêche une certaine forme de monopole d’apparaître. Une des autres choses qui a limité Microsoft a été l'existence de droits des consommateurs qui dans quelques cas courageux et désintéressés ont réussi à interdire certaines pratiques. Dans certains cas, on soupçonne même que Microsoft a un peu aidé Apple (je crois qu'ils ont injecté des fonds) pour justement empêché d'être catalogué légalement comme monopole sur les systèmes d'exploitation. Sans ces garde-fous, Apple n'aurait pas survécu à son marasme pré-Steve Jobs, et Linux aurait été sans pitié exterminé en rendant les ordinateurs utilisant windows incapables de booter linux (ce qu'ils font mais d'une façon beaucoup plus subtile aujourd'hui, ils peuvent se prévaloir d'excuses techniques)

&gt; Pour la subvention et la coupe d'impôt ayant de la famille qui essaient de l'avoir, non ce n'est pas si facile que ça, et c'est très loin d'être suffisant. Quand tu embauches tu as toujours de très nombreuses charges à payer pour le salaire de tes employés.

Je ne parle pas de ça sans connaitre. J'étais employé avec ce statut dans une JEI avant, et je discute beaucoup avec son fondateur. Bien sur qu'il faut payer des charges, l'emploi a un coût. Et je te confirme que ces aides sont relativement faciles à obtenir et couvrent une grande partie du salaire.

&gt; Toutes les milliards de restrictions faites sur la bouffe qui empêche quicquonque de percer le marché devant les coût alors induits. (tout est fait chez kraft foods, néslé ou danone en France).

Donc les AMAP, ça n'existe pas ou c'est illégal ?

&gt; Toutes les restrictions sur la construction d'immeuble, et là y en a, t'as vu le prix d'achat qui en résulte.

Quel genre de restrictions aimerais tu enlever ? Je crois bien qu'elles sont les mêmes pour une petite boite que pour un gros constructeur.

&gt; Toutes les restrictions sur l'emploies, permettant ainsi à toutes les grosses boîtes (alias monopoles) de n'engager des gens qu'en stagiaire en échange du nom de la boîte sur leur CV. Profitant ainsi à ces boîtes par rapport aux petites qui sont obliger de payer leur employé car n'ayant pas de nom à leur proposer.

Donc, si on enlève les restrictions sur l'emploi, d'après toi le nom des petites boites deviendrait plus attractif sur un CV ? Tu peux m'expliquer le mécanisme là ? 
Il y a justement une ""restriction"" de l'état dans ce domaine : les stagiaires doivent maintenant être payés s'ils travaillent plus de 3 mois. En théorie, ça devrait aller dans ton sens ce genre de restriction, non ? Pourquoi pas ?

&gt; Toutes les restictions sur les drogues permettants à certains cartels très armée de conserver leur monopole.

Là dessus on est d'accord.

&gt; Toutes les restrictions sur les médicaments où les examens se révèlent en vérité pourri, pas fiable et très cher 

C'est bien un de nos points de désaccord : je suis d'accord que certains services sont mal remplis par l'état (en l’occurrence, il y a des conflits d'intérêt et de l'incompétence dans les tests de médicament) mais toi tu proposes d'amputer un bras pour un ongle incarné. Supprime les validation de médicaments et en 2 jours on trouve en pharmacie des substances en vente libre ayant une accoutumance pire que l'héroïne.

&gt; LA restriction, qui fait qu'on attend 10 ans d'utilisation aux US avant de valider quoique ce soit en France.
C'est juste faux. Ça marche pas comme ça.

&gt;&gt; Explique moi également comment on fait pour percer avec une startup dans un domaine où un concurrent peut faire du dumping et des économies d'échelle pour t'empêcher d'entrer.
&gt; Ouai c'est pour ça que free n'a jamais pu percer... a non! Désolé ça a percé ;)

Free n'est pas exactement une startup. Ils ont du aligner des milliards et ils n'ont pu obtenir une portion de spectre que parce que l'état (via l'ARCEP) a imposé l'entrée d'un 4e acteur, au nom de la concurrence. Autrement, Orange Bouygues et SFR auraient aligné quelques centaines de millions de plus pour empêcher Free f'avoir accès à ces licences.

Après, tu vas me dire qu'imposer d'acheter et de respecter des licences est une régulation de l'état qu'on devrait faire sauter, n'est ce pas ? Ou arrives-tu quand même à comprendre que le spectre radio doit être régulé pour que quoique ce soit fonctionne correctement par radio ? Sans régulation, je pourrais décider que je ne veux pas qu'on communique par téléphone portable dans mon quartier et installer pour une somme ridicule un brouilleur qui empêche toute communication sur l'ensemble des fréquences.
