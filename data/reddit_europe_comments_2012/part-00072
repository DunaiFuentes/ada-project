Also, the area is likely very rural, public transportation may be a pain (depending on the exact location, it was in my village). Will you have a bike you can use? That may be handy if the city is not too far away. Some local cuisine you may want to try: Grünkohl mit Pinkel (kale with a type of sausage), Snirtjebraten (a pork dish), Bohntjesopp (rasins in something similar to brandy, usually served after a child is born) and, of course, Krabben (a tiny shrimp), which are still fished for in the area. None of these are favorites of mine though, if you ask me, East Frisian cuisine is too hearty. Krabben are tasty though, get some fresh ones, ""unpeeled."" The peeled ones often get shipped to Morocco and back for peeling. Just don't forget to peel them or you'll have a crunchy surprise ;)

true,MightyMousePepTalk,UKGB,FIB - My life is a lie.,"I won't lie, but democratic deficit is one of the major problems of the European Union: a lot of people just don't care and the turnout for European elections is shockingly low.

As for moving slower, Britain proposed this way back in the 1950s as a counter to the the proposed Schumann Plan. It was quickly dismissed by Monnet and the other Five original members of the ECSC. Why? He wanted a supranational body, not an intragovernmental one. He saw this as the only way to prevent further wars between France and Germany. You create and economic union first, and the other forms of union will follow. Neo-functonalism is the theory behind this if you want to look it up.

Another problem is that the Commission isn't answerable to the Parliament, but it should be. Whitehall can't go around doing what it wants unless Westminster approves, and this should be a similar situation within the EU.

However, whilst I recognise your point about the complexity, the institutions you have listed above have very clearly defined competences, and this needs to be so: you cannot have an organisation as big as the EU without splitting these up. I have just completed a Master focusing on the European Union, and these institutions are not the problem.

As for the Euro, your point about it being too far too fast is valid, and there are some countries that clearly should not have joined from the start. That was politics over-ruling common sense, I'm afraid. But the current crisis was caused (arguably) by France and Germany. At the Treaty of Maastricht, very strict rules were set out over levels of debt and the like that each country could have. If you broke these rules, bad things would happen. France and Germany broke the rules, but because they were France and Germany, nothing happened as they could veto any action. So other nations realised they wouldn't get punished and became a bit lax in their regulation. ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone"" meant no one would do anything to stop the slacking.

You make a good point about centralisation, but I think you've hit the nail on the head with that it should be more accessible to its citizens, rather than just those in the Euro-Bubble.

All this said, I'm still very much in favour of the EU.",0,1339574987,null,0,false,0,c4zy6s5,t3_uymuq,t1_c4zy6s5,t1_c4zsn9b,null,1435708929,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Pour la question de la sécurité des comptes, titrer ""La sécurité en option payante"" est d'une stupidité absolue. La sécurité d'un compte en ligne dépend fortement de la sécurité du poste client et donc du PC de l'utilisateur. Aux dernières nouvelles, les éditeurs de jeu ne sont pas tenus (encore heureux !) de sécuriser le PC des joueurs, ce qui est de la responsabilité de ces derniers. Le mieux qu'ils puissent faire, c'est de proposer de l'authentification forte à deux facteurs, sous la forme de l'authenticator et de faire la chasse aux keyloggers via le launcher du jeu, ce qui est déjà pas mal. De même, prétendre que la version mobile de l'authenticator est ""moins sécurisante"" est de mauvaise foi : c'est probablement techniquement vrai dans l'absolu, mais pas pertinent pour un compte Battle.net.

true,Feint1,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;I've never once denied that the UK is a net contributor, just like Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Ireland (Source: 2009 EU budget). I don't see how that equals to robbing?

How is this even remotely hard to understand? British taxpayers are being forced to subsidies other countries with which we share no connection. Even while this country is going through tough austerity the Europeans want to increase the EU budget. Why on earth should Britain be paying anything to this undemocratic institution? It provides us no benefit.

&gt;But in what form does the UKIP have more seats than Labour? Labour currently have 238 seats in parliament, and the UKIP have 2. Furthermore according to [1] UKpollingreport labour are projected to have the majority. So I do have to ask, in what universe does the UKIP have more seats than Labour? Perhaps I misunderstood your phrasing.

I was clearly talking about the European parliament.

&gt;I realise that it is difficult to bring the benefits and drawbacks of the EU into numbers, as many of them are abstract, but what exactly are the burdens of the EU as opposed to the benefits?

Loss free trade, loss of national fisheries, loss of immigration controls, loss of democracy, massive increase in bureaucracy, loss of liberty and the loss of national sovereignty. These are only a few of the current problems. The Germans are now pushing for further integration with much stricter control.

There are no benefits.

&gt;Do you genuinely believe that the UK will be better off isolated than closely cooperating with it's neighbours? over 50% of the entire UK import/export industry is directly with the EU, and that's not even mentioning the huge benefits the UK financial industry has due to trade received from the EU and into the EU. Withdrawing the UK from the EU makes very, very little economic sense.

This is a common European strawman. 

Closely cooperating with neighbours is completely different from being annexed and dictated to by neighbours. It has nothing to do with cooperation and everything to do with creating a single European state.

50% of the UK's imports and exports are with the EU because they won't allow for Britain to control it's own trade agreements. The EU forces trade within the EEA and limits trade with outside bodies. And besides, no one wants to stop trading with Europe, people want independence from Europe.

true,MightyMousePepTalk,UKGB,FIB - My life is a lie.,"I'll admit I have stolen the phrase from works that focus on the Thirty Years' War, and I do not have an exact source for you. For works that cover this period very well I would recommend you to the works of Jeremy Black.

You are very correct that correlation doesn't mean causality, and this is one of the main arguments against Democratic Peace Theory (democracies do not go to war with each other). Just because they haven't gone to war, it does not mean it is because they are democracies.

However, to return to your question, war often broke out in Europe due to the Balance of Power, where countries would wage war as a way of containing another state. ""War"", to quote Clausewitz, ""is the continuation of politics by other means."" It was seen as normal. There are many works on the Balance of Power - Schroeder, Pollard to name two. When peace came, it was never to be a permanent peace, only the end of that particular war. The Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) and the resulting Concert of Europe in (1815-1913) was the first time that European powers tried to address this, with William Pitt the Younger's proposal of a third party mediation to prevent two nations from going to war, but there were still wars during this period (Franco-Prussian; Italian; Crimean) and it failed to prevent The Great War.

I realise that there are other factors behind Western Europe not going to war, and I acknowledged that in my original post. Yet, The Great War was suppose to ""End all Wars"" and we know how that turned out. The Coal and Steel Community was to firmly put an end to it by merging the two main industries that one needed to wage war.

I as a traditionalist think marriage is a vow, a promise, an alliance, that one is honor-bound to uphold, so if there is a divorce, there must be someone at fault: cheating or being aggressive. Simply ""growing apart"" is no excuse to me, for marriage is not about love, but about an alliance for kids. So I am against no-fault divorce.

""Which means Germany contributes 25% which is by far the biggest chunk. You are just conceding my point.""

What kind of logic is this? What happened to Germany, the country of great philosophers and scientists, that followed on the steps laid out by their grandfathers from Greece? To give you another example, if 75% of the people don't vote for a party, and the first party gets 25%, do you think that it should rule a country without considering other opinions? I'm sorry but as  German you should know better. I'm not going down that path. I'll just say that the solution is to wake up and see that your money are recycled through Greece, then given to corrupt bankers. Hate them, not Greeks.

See, this is a typical false equivalence. Yes, violence from far-left groups happens...but it's mostly single incidents and limited to police in a riot setting.

Left-wing extremists do not terrorize rural towns, they do not harass citizens for not following their ideology to a point and they do not beat up people for looking like a foreigner.

What Nigel fails to mention is that with a fiscal union and banking union, the problems of a singular monetary union would be solved. It would make it easier for the ECB to act like a real central bank and engage in some QE. There are many federal states with different economic circumstances in different member states. This is not some unimaginable construct that some paint it to be. And it's only good that the ECB will try to clean up the banking sector in the troubled countries. A single market for all the peoplse of Europe is a goal worth having in this global world. Dreams of autarky in the individual member states are sorely misguided. But of course in a federal state they will have some idiosyncrasies that they will have to fund themselves if it diverges from the rest of the EU. But there needs to be more harmonization. Especially in sectors susceptible to local corruption (the banking sector).

The prosperity Germany now enjoys is partly a result of a more competitive currency than the old dmark. Without it their export industry wouldn't be as competitive.

&gt;Tout le monde sait qu'un bac S obtenu dans un petit lycée de banlieue et un bac S à Henri-IV ne seront pas considérés de la même manière à l'entrée de l'enseignement supérieur.

Puis plus loin :
&gt;Je suis pour le contrôle continu

Mais le controle continu ne fera que renforcer le problème de l'inégalité des lycées ! Une note de controle continu à Heni IV sera encore mieux vue qu'une note d'un ""lycée de banlieue"".

Un avantage du bac est que les sujets sont communs à tous les lycées et que les lycéens sont évalués sur le même problème indépendamment de la qualité de la formation proposée par leur lycée (en tout cas en métropole).

Le principe général est d'évaluer les lycéens sur la base de la même épreuve. Certes un lycéen d'Henri IV aura peut-être eu de meilleures conditions de travail qu'un lycéen de banlieue (pour reprendre l'exemple de l'article), mais au final si ces deux lycéens ont 18 en maths au bac, on peut raisonnablement penser qu'ils ont le même niveau.

Tous les lycées ne préparent pas aussi bien à l'épreuve, on ne peut pas nier ça. Mais le controle continu ne ferait que renforcer ce problème : non seulement la préparation de l'épreuve se fera dans des conditions différentes, mais l'épreuve elle-même sera différente.

Due to faults in the monetary union it is only fair that the winners also take part in fixing the mess. So inflation in the core countries would alleviate the pain the in the periphery.

If you´re going to use a bus or metro more then 3-4 times a day get an abono, 52 euros will let you use all the trains, metro and buses in most of the city, the paperwork will cost around 12 euros more but its unlimited use (it gets disabled for 10 minutes after every use to make sure you dont pass other people with you). Just make sure you´re staying in A zone. 

Restorants, theres tons of cool places to eat at chueca, la latina, Sol ,careful becuase most restorants around sol are more expencive due to being directed at tourists.

For tapas i would recomend la blanca paloma on espiritu santo (near tribunal), its basicly a place where you sit down, order some beers and the more you drink the more tapas they bring around, 

You should go bar hoppin in la latina, huertas and tribunal, la latina is more cultural, huertas is more of a older crowd while tribunal is younger and more alternative. 

theres a nice route if you get off at tribunal, walk to alonso martinez from there to chueca, funcareal, gran via, callao, sol, Plaza mayor, and then go to the palacio de oriente, 

leave your stuff at a safe place and only come out with your keys, your phone, the cash you might need and ID. no one will accept a credit card/debit card without a valid id here. 

theres some degree of street crime, it might sound racist but usualy its small thefts and pickpocketing commited by romanian gypsies, if someone stops you on the street to read a map or sign a petition decline respectfully and walk away. 

Madrid has 2 rail systems, 

* Metro - internal to the city and makes moving around easy and owning a car quite obsolete, it costs 1,50 for a ride, 12 for 10 rides and 52 for unlimited while you´re in zone A, the unlimited requires a card that costs 12 euros, passport photo and a valid id. 

* Cercanias - mostly used to connect the suburbs but is usfull in some cases inside the city, i live near chanmartin so by bus or metro i would take close to half an hour to get to sol, cercanias leaves me there in 9 minutes, its basicly faster becuase its got fewer stops inside the city. 

Theres also the buses, i would only recommend them if you´re sure of the buses route, the cost the same as the metro but the 10 ride cards have to be purchesed in metro stations or news stands/tabaco shops. 

Pickpocketing is common in rush hours when the metro or busses are stuffed so be aware of your sorroundings and travel against one of the sides or sitting if possible. 

since you´re going to be here for a month i suppose you´re not going to eat out all the time, if you go to a local supermarket :

Cheap : Lidl, Dia, Mercadona, IFA.

Middle of the road : Alcampo, Caprabo, Eroski, Carrefur.

Expencive : Supermercado el corte ingles, Hipercor, Sanchez Romer. 

The expencive ones are sometimes worth a visit becuase they tend to have import stuff, if you´re missing something from home. but there is a candy store near tribunal which carries alot of american sodas and candy if you feel homesick and theres a company called taste of america which has representation in most Corte ingles stores which have a food section/Supermarket.

Bar zones : La latina is sufisticated for older crowds, Huertas is somewhat expencive, Tribunal is for the 20´s uni crowd, avoid alonso martinez becuase its mostly for high school kids (unless you´re in to that, age of concent in spain is 16... but i personaly wouldn´t)

Food markets which are worth seeing, San anton in chueca (my favorite ice cream place is a block away in the plaza), San miguel which is a bit after plaza mayor, before opera, both of those are the artistic and expencive tourist aimed markets, the maravillas market near cuatro caminos is more down to earth, theres also the chinese food market under plaza españa if you´re looking for something a bit more exotic. 

Thats all i can remember off the top of my head right now.

Un avantage du bac est que les sujets sont communs à tous les lycées et que les lycéens sont évalués sur le même problème indépendamment de la qualité de la formation proposée par leur lycée (en tout cas en métropole).

Le principe général est d'évaluer les lycéens sur la base de la même épreuve. Certes un lycéen d'Henri IV aura peut-être eu de meilleures conditions de travail qu'un lycéen de banlieue (pour reprendre l'exemple de l'article), mais au final si ces deux lycéens ont 18 en maths au bac, on peut raisonnablement penser qu'ils ont le même niveau.

D'accord avec toi. Le fait qu'une filière d'enseignement supérieur sélectif (au hasard, une classe prépa prestigieuse) préfère prendre un élève sortant de son propre établissement que d'un petit lycée de banlieue n'a **rien** à voir avec le bac. De même, le bonhomme précise que seuls 15% des enfants issus de la classe ouvrière ont un bac général. En quoi il y a un rapport avec l'organisation actuelle du bac ?

&gt; Tous les lycées ne préparent pas aussi bien à l'épreuve, on ne peut pas nier ça. Mais le controle continu ne ferait que renforcer ce problème : non seulement la préparation de l'épreuve se fera dans des conditions différentes, mais l'épreuve elle-même sera différente.

La différence n'est pas à mon avis par rapport à la préparation à l'épreuve mais plutôt la préparation au supérieur. Je pense que dans quel lycée que ce soit, les profs sont suffisamment compétents pour préparer un élève au bac, que ça soit à Henri IV où à Sarcelles. Par contre, dans les grand lycées prestigieux et/ou privés, les élèves étant souvent excellents, ils trouvent facilement le temps de leur enseigner des notions normalement étudiées dans le supérieur. Donc comme je l'ai déjà dit, pas de rapport avec le bac.

&gt; Le bac n'est pas un concours. Il n'y a pas de numerus clausus. Les résultats d'un lycéen au bac ne dépendent pas du résultat des autres lycéens. Rien n'empêche de réviser ensemble et de s'entraider. 

Entièrement d'accord, il me semble d'ailleurs que le TPE est une épreuve collective. Et même dans les préparations à des concours auxquelles j'ai pu participer, je n'ai jamais vu d'esprit de compétition mais plutôt de l'entraide et du ""serrage de coudes"".

&gt; On peut trouver une meilleure façon de sanctionner le diplome, des sujets qui laissent plus de place à la réflexion qu'à la restitution bête de connaissances, sans pour autant remettre en cause le principe de soumettre tous les lycées à la même épreuve.

Pas mieux, c'est vrai qu'actuellement, mêmes les épreuves où on a l'impression de prendre part à une réflexion (Philo, Géographie, Rédaction en Anglais...), c'est en fait de la restitution du cours, souvent avec le même plan ou bien un argumentaire banal sur un sujet bidon (ça c'est pour la question généralement posée en Anglais).",0,1339591250,null,0,false,0,c4zzpa1,t3_uzkau,t1_c4zzpa1,t1_c4zzf6g,null,1429132681,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

true,kopin,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Well, if they stop helping us, what's our incentive to keep paying external debt?  
  
Because we will need them again soon, and not only for loans.  I'm not sure whether a country can survive in isolation from the world markets.  I am personally aware of several small to medium sized Greek importer/exporter companies that are already having trouble and may go out of business soon (through no fault of their own), because their suppliers/clients are having serious doubts about the country's future, and are imposing extremely strict, almost impossible terms of payment/delivery.  And from their side, they are right: would you sell on credit, risking your own money, to a customer whose country (including banks) is on the verge of collapse?  No credit insurance institution will cover selling to a country which is likely to halt payments.  Please bear in mind that I am not talking about ""evil capitalists"" here, just people trying to make a living in the international trade.
  
&gt; Right now, Greece's finances would be balanced if it wasn't for the ridiculous debt burden we took the past few years.  
  
But now they are not, so unless a way to rewind time is found, there is no use in whining about this.  Also, I didn't hear anyone complain that the debt was ""ridiculous"" when a large part of the population was enjoying this borrowed money before it actually ran out.  Anyway, even if the public debt were to magically disappear overnight, Greece would still be running a deficit in 2012, despite all the cruel blanket pay cuts, 3 types of extra taxes, etc.  It is already obvious that this austerity cannot extend indefinitely, so Greece still needs external financing.  The numbers are publicly available for all to see at the ministry of finance's website.  
  
&gt; You can't expect a country, much less a democracy, to let its people starve so it can pay external debts. That's common sense.  
  
Wholeheartedly agree, this is why they do not insist on austerity alone, but also economic reforms (an integral part of the Memorandum that the demagogues pretend does not exist), which have not been (willfully or due to incompetence, I don't care) carried through by the Greek governments in the last two years.  In order to re-negotiate, one needs at least to show _some_ progress in the right direction.  Otherwise, there is always Ceausescu's example, who indeed paid off the entire public debt with 20 years of extreme poverty and misery, which most Greeks haven't even dreamed of (food rationing, no central heating, etc.).
  
&gt; pro-EU fascist regime (Golden Dawn comes to mind)  
  
I think the emergence of Golden Dawn is (among other reasons, but not solely) due to the rise of opposite far-left tendencies, and people's fear that similar tendencies exist inside e.g. SYRIZA (which, in my opinion, is Sunday School stuff compared to e.g. ANTARSYA).  It's this stupid, futile ""commie vs fascist"" mentality, which leads absolutely nowhere, and is yet perpetuated by a significant part of the public, that is holding an entire country back.  I can't conceive of any person in their right mind who would vote for an extreme party to protect himself from another extreme party, but reality says they exist.  And anyway, Golden Dawn is extremely anti-EU, not least because the EU has a fundamental respect of human rights.  
  
Overall it looks like the EU has also made some serious mistakes in handling the situation, namely these ""Greece should behave"" comments, which sound very much like threats, and contribute to a general feeling of uneasiness to all parts and accomplish nothing.  Whether we like it or not, Greece has signed a contract, which cannot be unilaterally broken if Greece wishes to continue to be taken seriously.  Still the contract _can and should_ be re-negotiated in case ""new shit comes to light"" as the Dude would say, but what Greece needs to present on the bargaining table is arguments, not ideology or empty rhetoric.  I am very pessimistic in that respect, because I don't see any of today's political parties as capable of taking Greece out of this situation, but this is another story.",0,1339593307,null,0,false,0,c4zzzr8,t3_uxsr0,t1_c4zzzr8,t1_c4zze19,null,1429132831,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Certes un lycéen d'Henri IV aura peut-être eu de meilleures conditions de travail qu'un lycéen de banlieue (pour reprendre l'exemple de l'article), mais au final si ces deux lycéens ont 18 en maths au bac, **on peut raisonnablement penser qu'ils ont le même niveau**.

Une remarque sur ce passage, c'est tout à fait faux.

Un lycéen à Henri IV en Terminale S commence le programme de Mathématiques Supérieures à un moment ou un autre dans son année de Terminale. Il est le résultat d'une lourde sélection déjà entamé à l'entrée du lycée, si ce n'est bien avant (Henri IV et Louis-le-Grand fonctionnent en dehors de la carte scolaire en pratique). Déjà au collège Henri IV (puisque c'est une cité scolaire collège-lycée-CPGE), la route toute tracée pour les élèves de sixième est d'intégrer une formation d'excellence.

There are some grammatical problems in what I guess, I think some of it may be wrong. Still, a start.

So, basically, Jean Baptiste Girard was married to someone called Maria Magdalena d'Hermont (or so I guess) and was widowed. Maria Magdalena Grossier was married to John Rinkel and widowed too. They married each other in St Louis, MO in 1899 (or maybe 1855) in the presence of George and Thibault Rinkel which I guess would be relatives of the bride's former husband.

It's definitely not wrong to divert more resources to a well-organized terrorist group committing murders, assaults, and/or threats with ample connections to other similar groups and political parties, than to a few scattered instances of property damage.

If you don't do that, you get something like the militante gruppe and the NSU: A massive use of resources to catch people who attempted to set fire to Bundeswehr vehicles, with innocent people being surveilled and arrested for ridiculous reasons, while catching serial killers only after they've committed a bank robbery and killed themselves.

&gt; In my opinion, we don't need a discussion about opinions but we should focus on the criminals, independent of their background.

Okay, if you're already in Düsseldorf and already drank some ""Alt"" beer and met a lot of Yuppies, you can either go north (straight to wonderful Hamburg or, even better, Berlin) or, as fimcotw mentioned, take the train down south through the Rhine valley. Not the express train, but the RE (regional express). You'll spend some time in Cologne drinking ""Kölsch"" partying hard. After your horrible headache for the 2nd day, you'll again take the train further south: Bonn, then Koblenz (check out the Ehrenbreitstein castle. Gorgeous. I live there). Afterwards, you'll hop on the train to go to Mannheim or Karlsruhe. Quite some architecture there, but not for more than a day. From there, you could go to Munich. See and explore, get drunk on ""Helles"". If you want to round it up, organize yourself a car ride over mitfahrgelegenheit.de. It's a website where people can buy seats in other people's cars when they're travelling long distances. Example: Cologne - Hamburg by train is 100€ oneway. With this service, shouldn't be more than 30. Same thing goes when you go Munich - Berlin. When in Berlin, you will obviously get completely lost and stop thinking about ever going back home. There's really nothing that comes close to Berlin in Summertime. I've travelled a lot, but this is top notch. Have fun!

Mais quelle importance, puisque le BAC ne sert à rien et ne discrimine en presque rien dès lors que le candidat est capable de faire partie des 85% de sa classe d'âge qui vont avoir le BAC. Le BAC est simplement un oui/non pour l'accès aux études supérieures.

&gt; Je ne suis pas d'accord. Un concours n'est pas équitable, par définition (je ne dis pas que c'est un problème). Dans un concours, l'admission dépend directement des résultats des autres, c'est un classement relatif. Si vous candidatez pour une université peu demandée, vous allez passer facilement. Ou si vous candidatez au milieu de très bons concurrents, vous allez être rejeté alors que vous aviez peut-être toutes les compétences requises. Donc ce n'est pas équitable, le même candidat rendant la même copie n'aura pas les mêmes chances d'être admis selon le niveau des concurrents.

Seul compte en effet votre placement. Bien sûr les candidats vont être avantagés par la qualité de la formation et de l'éducation qu'ils ont reçu, de la culture qu'ils ont et d'autre chose, mais il n'y a pas de faire valoir lors d'un concours. Pourtant un concours est équitable...

&gt; Donc ce n'est pas équitable, le même candidat rendant la même copie n'aura pas les mêmes chances d'être admis selon le niveau des concurrents.

Cette phrase me semble défier toute logique. Il est clair que deux candidats différents présentant le même concours et obtenant le même résultat auront exactement la même chance d'être admis, de plus leur admission est décidé par le score de la copie anonyme qu'ils rendent et rien d'autre, et c'est pour cela qu'un concours est tout à fait équitable !

Les universités n'étant pas égale dans la qualité de leur formation, il n'y aurait rien d'illogique à ce que les plus réputées (et, on peut l'espérer, les meilleures) ait des critères d'admission plus restreint. Dans la réalité d'ailleurs, les places étant limités, il y a une forme de sélection par certains biais. Sinon quel critère proposez-vous pour décider de l'accès aux formations d'excellence ? Actuellement, ils sont essentiellement géographiques (ce qui n'est pas équitable) ou, pour certaines formations, au mérite (examen de dossiers, ce qui est moins équitable qu'un concours). 

&gt; Ou si vous candidatez au milieu de très bons concurrents, vous allez être rejeté alors que vous aviez peut-être toutes les compétences requises.

Les candidats qui auront un meilleur score que vous ont aussi en générale ces compétences requises, et puisqu'il y a un nombre de places limités, il y aura des gens sur la touche. Il y a le problème de l'adéquation du concours avec les compétences qu'on demande de vous, mais pour la plupart des formations universitaires, cela n'est pas bien compliqué.

Il est clair que deux candidats différents présentant le même concours et obtenant le même résultat auront exactement la même chance d'être admis, de plus leur admission est décidé par le score de la copie anonyme qu'ils rendent et rien d'autre, et c'est pour cela qu'un concours est tout à fait équitable !

Absolument pas. Soit un concours, avec un sujet quelconque. Vous avez 10 à ce concours et tous les autres candidats ont 11, vous êtes rejeté. Vous vous représentez l'année suivante et obtenez 10 **à la même épreuve avec le même sujet** alors que les autres candidats ont tous 9, vous allez être admis. Pourtant vous avez fait la même performance. Votre ajournement/admission n'est due qu'à la compétence/incompétence de vos concurrents, **indépendamment de votre performance individuelle**.

Un concours est une compétition qui donne lieu à un classement. Prenez l'exemple d'une épreuve athlétique, disons le 100 mètres. Si vous courrez en 25 secondes et que vos concurrents courrent en 35 secondes, vous êtes sacré champion alors que vous avez fait une piètre performance. Vous pouvez aussi finir en 10 secondes parmi des concurrents finissant en 9 secondes, et être classé dernier. Dans les deux cas, votre classement n'indique rien quant à la qualité de votre performance.

&gt;Mais quelle importance, puisque le BAC ne sert à rien et ne discrimine en presque rien dès lors que le candidat est capable de faire partie des 85% de sa classe d'âge qui vont avoir le BAC. Le BAC est simplement un oui/non pour l'accès aux études supérieures.

Je ne vois pas le problème avec ça. Le but du bac est de savoir si vous avez acquis les connaissances minimales pour aller à l'université. Que le niveau requis soit trop bas, OK, mais le but du bac n'est pas de trier les lycéens en disant ""nous avons X places en université disponibles donc nous les donnons aux X meilleurs bacheliers"".

Ils s'y installent et y demeurent non pas par chois, mais parce que c'est la seule solution.

Avec en illustration une carte où les points indiquant les villes étaient des petites flammes. Paris était au centre de la France, Lyon au niveau de Cannes, Bordeaux en Espagne et Marseille en Italie. 

Oui, il y a des villes/quartiers qui sont ""dangereux"" autour de Paris, mais il y aussi des villes/quartiers très riches et exclusifs juste à côté... 

Je ne m'y connais pas particulièrement, mais parmi les coins qui craignent, il y a St-Denis, Puteaux, la Courneuve, Bobigny... et plein d'autres. Globalement, c'est plutôt au nord et à l'est de Paris. 

Je suppose que les gens s'y installent soit parce qu'ils y sont nés, soit parce que c'est moins cher que Paris et qu'ils n'ont donc pas le choix...? En France, le travail est majoritairement en région parisienne, donc tout le monde s'y entasse. Beaucoup de gens vivent dans des banlieues chic, traversent tout Paris en train pour aller travailler à St-Denis, et font donc environ 1h30/2h de transport public par jour. 

Beaucoup de gens dans ces villes sont immigrés, bien entendu. La France a beaucoup d'anciennes colonies en Afrique. Mais la discrimination est très forte, à l'emploi, au logement, etc. 

La rumeur veut que dans pas mal de services de ressources humaines en France, on préfère embaucher des ""BBR"" (Bleu-Blanc-Rouge) plutôt que des immigrés pour éviter tout risque de tension dans les équipes. Classe. C'est tout ce que j'ai comme anecdote. Il y en a plein d'autres plus intéressantes dans les archives en ligne des journaux français, sans doute.

I agree. I have some problems with the term ""terrorist"" - better use criminals, but it don't change anything.

Talking about the structure:
Both the lefts and the rights includes people who prefere violence and they all find their supporters.

I said we don't need a discussion about the opinion - let me explain:

It is a major mistake to take two assumptions:

* every neonazi is a hardcore national socialist,
* everyone, who is not a ""left"" is a facist.

In my opinion we are living in a moderate left driven society, which is demonising any kind of nationalism, traditionalism, militarism, ... and supports things like gender equality, universalism, ... (please take it value-free). It works that way, that (for example) a nationalist has no chance to articulate his opinion. The ideologists of the national socialists give this groups a possibility to articulate themself, and some members of this groups enter the neonazi-scene. This is how they get their supporters. So we can discuss the pros and cons of any opinion, but we wouldn't solve any problem. And by the way, what is the problem? Racism? - I don't think that's the main problem. A racist , who sits in his room whit his racist friend and reading racist books is not the problem, the problem starts when they get out and attack people, but than they are criminals.

So, if you want to solve the ""neonazi-problem"", please, think about the two wrong assumptions. But if you want to get safety, you have to react to all of the criminals.

Celles autour de Paris, Lyon, Marseille figurent parmi les plus dures. La situation est très tendus entre la police, ou toute représentation de la loi, et les plus jeunes des habitants.

Cela en fait des quartiers généralement propices à certains trafics (armes, prostitution et drogues). 

Ce problème est loin d'être un cas unique en Europe. Les banlieues de Naples ou de Londres ne sont très ""friendly"" non plus.

Ma version très courte: Les ""banlieues"" sont nées au sortir de la seconde guerre mondiale. La reconstruction de la France demande beaucoup de mains d’œuvres issues des futurs-ex colonies.

Leur installation entraine la création de bidonville pour commencer, avant de voir des constructions en béton et sur plusieurs étages émerger dans les années 60/70.

Cette population se mélange avec les classe populaires; ouvriers, employés etc. Une utopie de ville nouvelle faite de façon moderne devait assurer la réussite de tout ce beau rêve.

Malheureusement, de crise pétrolière en crise financière, aucun développement n'a pu vraiment se faire. 

Depuis les années 70, la situation n'a pas évolué, et surtout pour les enfants des premiers migrants, qui se retrouve dans une situation ambigüe. Enfants de la république mais considérés comme toujours étrangers, les ""jeunes"" rejettent souvent leur pays d'origine (la France) pour un pays ""rêvé"", celui de leurs parents. 

La culture rap y a fleurit comme la revendication d'un statut de ""ghetto"" pour ces jeunes. Ils voient dans les banlieues américaines comme South Central le reflet de leur vie. 

Les émeutes qui s'y produisent sont souvent causées par des chocs avec une représentation de l'ordre (contrôle de police qui tourne mal, des pompiers qui se font caillasser, ou bus/centre commerciaux vandalisés)

Il est déconseillé de se déplacer ""touristiquement"" dans ses endroits, on peut se faire facilement piquer sa voiture, et la nuit n'est pas forcement ton amie. Si cela est stéréotypé, ces conseils restent valables, mais on peut les étendre à Paris ou à tout le territoire français.

true,Spreader,null,null," Ecoute c'est un long débat, mais pour faire court, je suis contre la propriété intellectuelle. Je paye pour un objet, je ne paye pas pour de l'information pure.
 Comment tu crois que les musiciens ont survécu tout ce temps quand il ne pouvaient pas distribuer un support physique ? Quand les conteurs n'avaient pas d'imprimerie ? Quand les acteurs n'avaient pas de caméra ?

 Ils jouaient en live, le plus souvent gratuitement en faisant appel à la générosité des gens. Qu'on le veuille ou non, le ""Pay what you want"" fonctionne, il y a pleins de preuves du succès de cette méthode quand le produit est présenté et personne n'a l'impression de se faire voler (il y a plus de clients qui payent moins, mais au total ça donne plus, plus de gens heureux et plus d'argent, qu'est ce qu'il faut de plus ?). Ca plus la pub et les moyens de diffusion actuels, il y a LARGEMENT de quoi financer une tonne de culture sans connerie de propriétés intellectuelle d'un autre temps. On ne peut pas être propriétaire d'une idée, d'un brevet, d'un gène : c'est con et contre-productif, c'est un frein à l'innovation majeur et il y a pleins d'exemples qui le prouvent.
 
 En France, les trouvailles des chercheurs ne leur appartiennent pas, ça appartient à la Science, à la connaissance de l'humanité et aucun chercheur ne vas toucher des droits d'auteur quand ses travaux seront repris en public ou par un autre chercheur. Et heureusement ! Si la recherche fondamentale (et non pas technologique) étaient entravées de brevets et autre propriétés d'idées, nous n'en serions pas là aujourd'hui. Alors c'est sûr, un chercheur n'est pas plein aux as, mais il y a un moment où il faut réfléchir au type de société que l'on veut :

 Est ce qu'il est tellement normal qu'un chanteur ou un compositeur gagne tant d'argent alors que des personnes sur-diplômées qui font avancer la Science touchent des salaires ""normaux"" ? Est ce qu'on peut pas juste envisager ne serait-ce qu'une seconde qu'un chanteur n'ait pas nécessairement besoin de brasser autant d'argent, d'autant plus qu'il s'agit d'un cas typique de métier/passion ? Il n'y a absolument aucune justification morale ou éthique pour considérer qu'un chanteur gagne plus qu'un chercheur, que je sache, l'un me semble plus utile à plus de monde, pourtant il gagne moins. Tu trouves ça logique ?

 Pour moi c'est une vrai question de société, aujourd'hui telle que la loi est, partager une information comme une chanson ou un divertissement est un délit, pas partager de la science. On a besoin de culture tout comme on a besoin de science, j'estime que le même régime peut exister, même si de toute façon comme dit précédemment, les artistes et les éditeurs gagneront toujours un fric indécent via la pub et les dons, j'en reste parfaitement persuadé.

 La propriété intellectuelle est une vaste fumisterie, et traiter quelqu'un qui télécharge de voleur est un mensonge : c'est faux, il ne vole rien de matériel, et une idée n'appartient à personne, si ce n'est dans une société bardée de lois artificielles. Quelqu'un qui a une bonne idée (une bonne musique, un bonne histoire, une grande découverte, une innovation technologique) est suffisamment avantagé sans qu'il n'y ait besoin de rajouter un loi imaginaire qui n'a ni queue ni tête (à quand la propriété intellectuelle d'une blague, qu'est ce qui m'en empêche quand Apple a le droit de breveter la forme rectangulaire d'une tablette ?).

 L'intermède marchandisation et matérielle de la culture est terminée (et n'aura durée qu'un siècle à l'échelle de l'humanité). Ca sera dur au début pour ceux qui en ont profité, mais il semble les évolution technologiques nous ramènent au temps où un chanteur ou un acteur n'était pas le maître du monde mais une personne qui divertit ses semblables qui le lui rendent bien, ni plus ni moins.

I don't want body counting and I don't see that we will get together in this point.

&gt;No, that's actually true. It's in the definition of ""neo-Nazi"". If you aren't a national socialist, you aren't a neo-Nazi.

I didn't say ""national socialist"", I said ""hardcore national socialist"" because most of them have no idea, what national socialism realy means (scroll down).

&gt;How did that suddenly come into play? Nobody claimed that.

and

&gt;Of course they do. It's just that their opinion enjoys little popularity, and so they'll get a lot of people who disagree with them.

Sorry, but terms like ""faschistoid""/""faschistisch"", ""sexistisch"", ""völkisch"", ""chauvinistisch"" are used by the lefts all the time, check out indymedia, check out some festival flyer and I have seen signs with exactly this words on it, that forces people not to enter some locations. I admit, the definition of this terms are not consistently, but this is exactly the point. Some rethorical questions for example:

Singing the first strophe of the Deutschlandlied, what is it? traditional or ""völkisch""

Saying that there are natural gender rules. What is it, ""sexistisch""?

Waving German flags, while a football game ...

- I could go on.

&gt;In general, this is not how they get their supporters. They look for &gt;people who have problems, solve some of them and tell them the rest &gt;of their problems will be solved when there is a Fourth Reich. &gt;Predilection to right-wing ideas might make their job easier, but it's &gt;not necessary. (Actually, they mostly pick uninformed people so they &gt;can safely feed them propaganda.)

Sorry, but this is only a part of the true. You have real national socialists, who are well educated and sure about their theory. You can't change their minds, so you have to accept it and find a way to deal with them. The mass of the neonazis are less educated and (you are right) they often have problems. These are the perfect guys for any kind of propaganda. The neonazis don't solve their problems but they give them acceptance, which they missed by society. This guys are trained to be a neonazi, but they could also be trained to be anyone else. The key for that is acceptance.

&gt;It's a problem because two racist friends talking racist might not &gt;directly attack somebody, but they might attract a third friend who &gt;becomes a racist and starts to attack. And when they're a hundred &gt;racist friends, they'll be going out on the street to openly harass, and &gt;nobody will dare to stand against them.

Wages are relatively high because of the high automation, Lohnstückkosten can only get lower through automation if the increased productivity does not result in higher wages (as it should).

&gt; In the end Germany is successful and can't be blamed for trying to be.

It can be blamed for the crisis in the Euro zone because this aggressive export oriented policy at the expense of wages does not work if everybody has the same currency. Before the Euro Greece would have had the option to adjust for these things through devaluation of their own currency.

**The German response**


Last week I wrote a column entitled The riddle of German self-interest. To my surprise, it received a lengthy response from a senior and highly respected official of the German finance ministry. I am very grateful for this reply, because it clarifies the German finance ministry’s position and raises a number of profound issues.


In the interests of clarifying these issues further, I comment below on some of the statements made in that letter.


From Mr Ludger Schuknecht:


&gt; Sir, Martin Wolf (“The riddle of German self-interest”, May 30) voices a fundamental critique of the European fiscal and economic policy strategy in the context of the current debt crisis. He argues that the “eurozone is now on a journey towards break-up that Germany shows little will to alter” given its many “neins” to anything that would break the “doom loop”.

&gt; Mr Wolf’s solution for the current problems is risk transfer via eurobonds (of some sort), and demand stimulation via cheaper money and less fiscal consolidation in Germany. But the public and markets have been led to believe in short-term measures for far too long. And they know there is too much moral hazard already. Eurobonds would only make it worse and the healthier countries − mainly Germany and France − cannot even afford them.


**Comment**: At least three points are worth making here.
First, the aim is not risk transfer, but rather substantially to reduce the problems members of the currency union now have in retaining liquidity in their sovereign bond markets. Mr Schuknecht argues that such multiple equilibria are impossible. There is good reason to believe he is wrong, as the Belgian economist, Paul de Grauwe has written. I discussed this issue at length here .
Second, I do not know what “short-term measures”, Mr Schuknecht is referring to. But the public presumably expects the eurozone at least to hit its inflation target. At present, there is good reason to doubt that it will.
Third, “moral hazard” is not the clincher Mr Schuknecht believes it is. We have fire brigades, despite moral hazard, because it is bad for the neighbourhood for a house to burn down. Nobody enjoys the experience of watching his house – or in this case, his economy – burn down. The idea that offering countries a cap on borrowing costs would encourage them to repeat the current experience is, to put it mildly, implausible. Governments really do dislike having 25 per cent unemployment rates (as in Spain today). The penalty is sufficient to discourage repetition.


Mr Schuknecht:

&gt; I would rather believe that the public and markets want to see a credible path towards a prosperous, sustainable and competitive euro area. This is what they were promised at the start of the economic and monetary union. Indeed, it is expansionary policies and weak fiscal positions that created the current problems of high debt and low competitiveness in the crisis countries in the first place. This is why the European strategy to deal with the crisis seeks to regain confidence through a combination of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms that will improve competitiveness and growth prospects. Such reforms have invariably succeeded wherever they have been implemented.


**Comment**: Mr Schuknecht surely knows that “expansionary policies and weak fiscal positions” did not create “the current problems of high debt and low competitiveness in the crisis countries in the first place”.


As the chart below (taken from the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook database) shows, Ireland and Spain had exceptionally low net public debt before the crisis. Portugal’s was close to that of France. Only Greece and Italy had relatively high debt. Italy’s net public debt fell substantially, relative to GDP, in the period leading up to the crisis, though not perhaps enough.


What did cause the crisis were huge balance of payments deficits, induced by excessive private lending, most of it to private borrowers (with the exception of Greece). The responsibility for such lending and borrowing surely rests on the shoulders of both lenders and borrowers.


As to the claim that “Such reforms have invariably succeeded wherever they have been implemented”, I can think of important cases where they failed: Argentina in the 1990s, for example. I fear this is a tautology: where such policies failed, they were not tried, by definition.


Moreover, “structural reform” is a woolly term. If by this Mr Schuknecht means that falling prices, induced by ultra-high unemployment, debt deflation and sovereign and banking insolvencies, will ultimately restore competitiveness, he is correct, provided the country is able to stick with such policies, for a very long period indeed (probably a decade, or even far longer). This is what is required if a country with a large private sector debt overhang and a sizable structural current account deficit is to eliminate its fiscal deficit, regain competitiveness and restore growth, particularly in a currency union whose core country has a structural current account surplus and low inflation. The question is whether democratic politics (or the eurozone) will survive the experience. I doubt it. 


Mr Schuknecht:

&gt; Rebuilding confidence also entails making European Union institutions more credible. Fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance and banking regulation and supervision are being strengthened. Firewalls worth about €1tn euro have been erected and supplemented by International Monetary Fund money. Given what we have achieved, any decision to disregard the rules or introduce ill-suited tools such as eurobonds could undermine this effort to rebuild confidence.


**Comment**:Mr Schuknecht must recognise that the firewall he mentions is in conflict with his desire to eliminate moral hazard. So we are really just talking abut its size. The question is whether the available firewall is big enough to deal with likely crises. The answer is: no. I agree that eurobonds (which would need to be conditional) are only one way to provide a firewall. I agree, too, that long-run fiscal transfers are undesirable (and have said so). The whole of southern Europe must not be turned into a large Mezzogiorno.


Mr Schuknecht:

&gt; Moreover, just as the European Central Bank has a duty to focus on the goal of maintaining price stability, Germany must not undermine its role as an anchor of stability via inappropriate and ineffective fiscal stimuli. Incidentally, the social implications of Mr Wolf’s recipe are highly problematic too. The short-term measures he puts forward focus on countering the deflationary tail-risks arising from financial instability. They would benefit those whose considerable fortunes were built or bolstered through excessive risk-­taking during the pre-crisis boom. By neglecting the tail-risk of a destabilising loss of confidence in our money, his approach would put at risk the savings of those who have no way out: the cash-holding lower and middle classes.


**Comment**: I do not think an attempt at symmetrical adjustment inside the eurozone would undermine German stability. But it would certainly be helpful to eurozone stability if, during the lengthy adjustment period ahead, German policymakers focused on policies likely to expand domestic demand. It does not really matter to the outside world what those policies are. An investment boom or a rapid rises in real wages would also be excellent.

As to the question of benefiting those who created the crisis, may I point out that German lenders were part of the problem. Are they (and other creditors) paying the penalty for their mistakes or are taxpayers in debtor countries being forced to assume the bulk of the costs?


Mr Schuknecht:


&gt; “Finally, let me reflect on Mr Wolf’s riddle of German self-interest. If one accepts the narrative that the risk of shipwreck comes from excessive “short-termism”, then there is no riddle at all. German and European interests are indeed very much aligned and they are reflected in the jointly agreed strategy. Germany will play its full role in implementing it − in its own and Europe’s interest.”

&gt; Ludger Schuknecht, Director General, German Ministry of Finance, Berlin, Germany


**Comment**: I fear that austerity without end will bring about a return to the unstable populist politics the European Union was designed to prevent. That could shatter the eurozone and, with it, the EU, thereby ending the most successful attempt to build peace and prosperity in Europe since the fall of the Roman Empire. 


Moreover, it is clear – and has long been so – that the responsibility for preventing that outcome rests on Germany, Europe’s central power, in every sense. As Charles Kindleberger argued, in a panic, the creditworthy country has to lend freely if a fixed exchange rate system (or in this case a currency union) is to survive.


It is often forgotten, not least in Germany, that the rise of Adolf Hitler to power was preceded not by the great inflation, which occurred a decade before, but by the great depression and the austerity of Heinrich Brüning, in response. Thus, votes for the Nazi party jumped from a relatively insignificant 810,000 in 1928, to 6.4m in 1930, and 13.7m in July 1932. Deep economic collapses are dangerous.


Deep economic collapses are very dangerous. Mr Schuknecht, with his emphasis on the long term, completely ignores these dangers.  If trying to avoid such a dire outcome is “short-termism”, so be it. I think of it as trying to find a practical exit from the current trap. Without it, the eurozone may never reach the long term.

L'intérêt de cette mise en demeure n'est pas d'intenter une action en justice : l'UFC demande à Blizzard de régler les problèmes sous une quinzaine de jours, sans quoi elle se réserve le droit d'effectuer une action en justice. Si Blizzard règle ces problèmes dans les temps je ne vois pas pourquoi l'UFC irait au procès. Ce n'est donc pas une question ""d'arriver après la bataille"", mais d'ordonner la résolution de problèmes qui impactent pas mal d'utilisateurs au vu des retours de l'appel à témoignage lancé par l'association.

Pour ce qui est du dédommagement, je ne vois pas en quoi un juge ne pourrait pas statuer sur un montant qui représenterait les dommages occasionnés pour les joueurs. Mais de toutes façons, à en lire le [communiqué de presse de l'UFC](http://www.quechoisir.org/telecom-multimedia/image-son/communique-diablo-3-face-a-l-enfer-vecu-par-les-joueurs-l-ufc-que-choisir-prend-les-manettes), ça a plutôt l'air d'être une demande de geste commercial pour les utilisateurs que d'un ordre donné sous peine de procès.

Personnellement je trouve pas mal ironique ce qui arrive à Blizzard : à avoir voulu imposer son DRM obligeant d'avoir une connexion permanente, l'éditeur se retrouve contraint à garantir le bon fonctionnement de ses serveurs sans quoi les utilisateurs peuvent lui demander des comptes.

&gt; Pour la question de la sécurité des comptes, titrer ""La sécurité en option payante"" est d'une stupidité absolue.

Pour moi c'est plus formulé maladroitement que stupide. Sur la version mobile de l'Authenticator jugée moins sécurisée, je pense que l'UFC a raison : une application mobile peut être la cible de plusieurs vecteurs d'attaque (faille dans l'OS du téléphone, application malveillante, ...) alors que la clé USB demande l'accès physique à cette dernière, ce qui est moins probable comme faille.

Bien qu'à mon avis l'appli mobile est largement suffisante pour la protection des comptes battle.net, l'UFC regrette que pour un jeu acheté 60€ et demandant l'utilisation de l'Authenticator (pour le système d'enchère visiblement), l'utilisateur doive dépenser en plus pour avoir la version la plus sécurisée. Ca ne me semble pas déconnant à ce point là dans la logique...

true,notangelamerkel,null,null,"I've read it yesterday. Coming from Ifo's president this was expected. I know his positions since the start of the crisis. He seems more eager to excuse Merkel than Merkel herself. But he failed in every single aspect for two years now. He compares apples and oranges and adds things that cannot be added. He writes that Greece ""has received or been promised $575 billion through assistance efforts, including Target credit, E.C.B. bond purchases and a haircut after a debt moratorium"". Greece has received 30% of that amount until now. Haircut was agreed with private investors and it's not really a haircut. 100 billion euros for the haircut, 130 billion euros for the loan to cover the haircut and recapitalise the banks (18 billion). But even if we agree with his logic, he proves that this program was a failure. He is forced to admit it, indirectly. He writes that ""should Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain go bankrupt and repay nothing, while the euro survives, Germany would lose $899 billion"", but ""should the euro fail, Germany would lose over $1.35 trillion, more than 40 percent of its G.D.P."" All these money for nothing. Well, not exactly nothing, because Germany profits, keeping its rates down. Other EU states were competitors while they had low rates. That's why Germany thinks it has no interest in doing anything substantial. But this is a complete fallacy, and Martin Wolf proves it beautifully with his closing statement, in his response to a German official.

I think it's pretty silly to go on about them but ofc the whole thing doesn't look good. However, at the times it was not hindered by the powers that be. People make mistakes. But here I'd like to invoke a hayekian view of things in the sense that we have to try out what works. Designing institutions of this magnitude can't be easy. (This might be an opprtune moment to ""stumble"" into a new arrangement)

So I think a failure of institutions shouldn't be turned into a morality tale. There have been a lot of capital and trade imbalances in the Euro area that have made themselves apparent. Overspending by the government wasn't the only problem. In Spain and Ireland it was more of a banking crisis that lead to problems subsequently. Sweden also had a banking crisis in the beginning of the 90s so it's not unheard of in *better* countries. In Europe it is now known and people are trying to remedy it. When you speak about the EZ unfairly pushing forward legislation, have you looked at what they are proposing in the democratically elected European parliament? But I suppose giving the EP more power would go against your vote on everything sensibilities. So it's a catch 22. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

In London, there's a stamp duty which is like a FTT or at least that is the model the FTT is approaching. Personally, I'm not a fan at all.

Oh, I think Mario Monti is pushing forward labor reforms as we speak. It can't be denied.

There are certains places you can visit that are close to it. I will recommend the three towns I always recommend to anyone visiting Germany, sorted by travelling distance from Frankfurt:

[Heidelberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg) ~1 hour drive from Frankfurt

[Trier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trier) ~2 hour drive from Frankfurt

[Weimar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar) ~3 hour drive from Frankfurt  (It's the town that essentially brought Germany many of its most famous classical artists/writers: Goethe, Schiller, Herder, Bach, Liszt, Hummel... Richard Strauss also decided to work there and it's the birthplace of the [Bauhaus art movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus).)  It's the namegiver of the [Weimar Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic). It's also generally a *very* beautiful town. ***BONUS***: When you actually travel to Weimar you can also pay a visit to the [KZ Buchenwald](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchenwald) to get your complete fix of German WWII history.)

These are (apart from the individual state capitals) the 3 German cities I would cite as fundemantal cultural and historical centers. All of them played significant roles in Germany's history and fostered many of Germany's greatest minds.

*Really* general advice: Apart from Frankfurt other major/important cities in Germany are Berlin, Hamburg, München and Köln. [There you go.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Germany_with_more_than_100,000_inhabitants)

Favourite place of Japanese people to visit: [Füssen, Bavaria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle).

My favourite places in Germany: The German islands in the baltic sea, such as [Amrum](https://www.google.at/search?sugexp=chrome,mod%3D19&amp;q=sylt&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=de&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=dhjZT7HqLc-EhQfVzJnyAw&amp;biw=1846&amp;bih=952&amp;sei=eBjZT8iED4batAby_sHsDw#um=1&amp;hl=de&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=amrum&amp;oq=amrum&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.5390.5894.6.6031.5.4.0.1.1.0.67.228.4.4.0...0.0.V9RcEJUklg8&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=67e173d3e85c4ab8&amp;biw=1846&amp;bih=952) or [Sylt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylt).

true,bowling4meth,null,null,"&gt; Now, Sevilla locals please tell me where to find the best tapas/chorizo/patanegra/sardine/gambas/wine/weed/music(jazz,soul whatever) and hidden treasures of Sevilla!

Wow, you're not asking for much. I'm English sadly, but love Seville, so here's my tips.

Best tapas: Bar Alfalfa

Best Chorizo: Take your pick in Santa Cruz - protip: if it's busy with locals after 8pm it's good, if it's busy beforehand walk by and come back later. If it's full of tourists avoid it.

Actually there's a Dia that does pretty good chorizo, standard stuff nothing fancy but very cheep.

Patanegra/Sardine/Gambas - there's a square up near Bar alfalfa, basically keep going up till you see a kids playground and turn left, then follow round to your right. Follow it round the next couple of corners and head straight on. Plenty of ok food, beer and a night club. Also bar cairo heading up to the bridge to triana.

In terms of hidden treasures, the bullfighting museum is good. It's also worth a day trip to Cordoba for the history and mesquita. There's some pottery around triana too that's worth a look.

In terms of a good neighbourhood to stay in, Santa Cruz is the main bit, there's a really good music themed hotel who's name escapes me. On a tighter budget head to hoteles monte de triana. We paid about 50 euros a night and while it's outside of central seville it's still quite good and walking distance.

Cadiz is shit. It really is. I don't mean this as an insult to people from Cadiz but it's made out to be a magical place and it's not, it's just a normal place with nice (but busy) beaches. Go to granada instead and see the alhambra, that's the kind of 'oh fuck moment' you're really looking for.

The best way to get to portugal from Seville is probably a flight to faro, but I believe you can get a renfe across the border (I might be wrong).

Any chance of sharing the Amsterdam info with the group? I've been there twice! If you'll excuse me my experience of centraal wasn't so great but once you get to around the heineken museum you're away from the stoners and perverts.",0,1339629517,null,0,false,0,c509a6g,t3_uzycy,t1_c509a6g,t3_uzycy,null,1429137281,2,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,2

This is aid is being paid with fucking interests! The debt these countries accumulated is mostly owed to German banks and used to buy German products, which became cheaper inside the European countries (especially after Germany decided to not raise its wages in accordance with productivity).
A lender who undertakes a loan with such high interest is aware of the risk and is compensating it. So when the debtor doesn’t pay he shouldn’t be bailed out.

&gt; Nuremberg - Munich

1.5 hours by car, 2-2.5 hours by train. Bayernticket costs 20 Euros, car costs 10. Just saying.

The only legit argument against Mitfahrgelegenheiten is safety. Not everyone feels safe getting in a car and travelling with a complete stranger, especially on longer journeys and night rides. You never know.

Also, fuck Deutsche Bahn. Service is shit. If your train is on time, hurray. Most of the time it isn't (it's a nightmare in the Winter). Some of the trips are a pain in the ass as well. To get to Heidelberg from Erlangen I had to change trains twice, once in Frankfurt and once in Stuttgart. On the way back it was Osterburken or something, and Würzburg. Fuck. Also, there is no such thing as limited seating in a train. It's not like a plane. They will sell tickets as long as they got electricity running. Regional trains can be overbooked - I've spent lots and lots of time standing for 2-3 hours in a train because there wasn't a seat left, and I wasn't alone.

**tl;dr:** fuck deutsche Bahn, you're better off getting there on foot.

The 29 euros are always available as the lowest tier (as long as it's not a short distance so the lowest tier is 19 euros), they're just sold out very fast sometimes, but you can sometimes get some [last-minute](http://bahn.ltur.com/).

Again, you seem to be riding different trains. Nuremberg - Munich with the ICE is one hour via Ingolstadt and even with the München-Nürnberg-Express it's 1 3/4 hours. With the car you're only going to make it in 1.5 hours at 2 a.m. in the morning when there is almost no traffic.

And if you're in a group (spontaneos or planned), Bayernticket costs you 38 euros for five people, and you aren't going to find Mitfahrgelegenheiten for 7.60.

&gt;As a rule, children born to a German and a non-German parent, or to parents with dual nationality, acquire the nationalities of both parents at birth, according to the principle of descent.

You also don't have to choose, you keep it permanently. In the next paragraph:

&gt;Those who have multiple nationality for one of these reasons normally pass multiple nationality on to their children. In such cases, German law allows children to retain their multiple nationality permanently; i.e., they do not have choose between their German and foreign citizenship upon reaching the age of majority.

Now this is what the German ministry of the interior says about it. I have no idea what U.S. law says about it. German law also says that you will lose your German citizenship if you sign up for the U.S. military, which could mean bad news if they count the draft as ""signing up"". I highly doubt that though.

&gt;Also, concerning your comment -""we have to try what works"". Do you honestly mean, that countries can ""try"" to follow rules, or perhaps not, just to see what works?

&gt;I can tell you what works - following the rules and the law. It is not something you just can disregard. If they had obeyed, the EU would not be in this situation. They caused this, but you still think rules are not to be followed.

A law is only as powerful as the penalty for breaking it. When a law is not enforced, it's not reasonable to expect everyone to follow it. For example, I've seen a lot of people crossing roadways illegally in Germany, despite the fact that Germans are among the most law-abiding people in the world. Yet, they often break this law because (1) they don't see any damage produced by this act and (2) they are not penalized from it.

This explains why Germany of all countries was among the first to break the Maastricht criteria. There was no damage visible - it seemed that Europe's economy was going up pretty steadily - and the penalty was orders of magnitude smaller than the immediate benefit.

So now it has become clear that breaking these rules is harmful. One obvious solution is to start enforcing them, hence all the talks about fiscal union and giving the EU more power.

&gt;I'd much rather that Sweden leave the EU than to be in an federation with people and countries who think and behave like they are above the law. Who shrink from their responsibilities and when called upon it, answers with ""be pragmatic"" or "" morality tales"". Nothing good can come of from that way of thinking or acting.

The laws were not broken because the Europe's countries are incapable of following laws, they were broken because the EU - who was supposed to enforce the laws - was too weak.

In order to guarantee the 160bn Euro of current Greek bank deposits, there needs to be 160bn Euro stashed somewhere (or at least half of it). A guarantee needs collateral (money or other assets)

Ireland guaranteed the money by a huge state loan which bankrupted the state. Immediately after that Ireland asked for financial help from EU and got a loan from EFSM and IMF.

Iceland did not get a loan and failed to hold the guarantee for non-Icelandic customers (they lost their savings).

Banks use fractional reserves, but if they go below a certain threshold, they stop lending. Greek banks are in the red (Blackrock audits show that), and have already stopped lending. According to Tsipras, they should continue to lend using the current deposits which of course are just 'thin air', just numbers in a computer. 

I wonder which newspapers you are reading, because the Greek banks are NOT given money by the Greek state (where would our state find the money to lend anyway).

z.B. habe ich die Prüfung am 26.4. geschrieben. Ich habe erst vorgestern meine Ergebnisse bekommen.

Wenn ich durchgefallen wäre und mich nicht für den heutigen Test angemeldet hätte, müsste ich mich für den Test am 18. Juli anmelden, dann würde ich keine Ergebnisse bekommen bis 29.8. und eventuell später. Das heißt ein Abstand von 3 Monaten zwischen den Tests und keine Chance auf einen NC-Platz. Deswegen muss ich mich für zwei test anmelden, um früh Ergebnisse zu bekommen. Und TestDAF weiss das doch.

Non seulement parce qu'on y a volontairement regroupé les immigrés, mais aussi parce qu'un ghetto n'est pas nécessairement ethnique. En l'occurence, le 93 a fait office de ghetto pour la région parisienne, ghetto à la fois ethnique/culturel (les immigrés) et social (les pauvres).

Avant la séparation la région parisienne en départements, c'était l'office HLM de la ville de Paris qui gérait tout le parc HLM, et ils ""se débarassaient"" des immigrés demandeurs de HLM en les envoyant en Seine Saint Denis. De manière plus générale, une bonne partie de l'immigration en région parisienne a eu pour but l'obtention de main d'oeuvre pas cher, pas exigeante et autant que possible non soumise au droit du travail Francais (surtout après 68), tout ca pour les industries qui étaient principalement dans le 93. C'est ce qui a fait que beaucoup d'immigrés étaient aussi pauvres et vivaient dans de mauvaises conditions. Si aujourd'hui, l'isolation est plus due à la pauvreté qu'à l'origine ethnique ou géographique, on ne peut pas ignorer la facon dont l'immigration s'est faite, associant immigra

Hit some bars and the market on Calle Feria on your way to Plaza de Hercules (the Alameda). The Alameda has bars, restaurants, tatoo shops, marijuana seed store, etc. These places are a little more eclectic than the rest of Sevilla and with a lot fewer tourists.

Visit the Metrosol Parasol (or ""Las Cetas"" as they're called) in Plaza de la Encarnación. It's a giant sculpture that really stands out and makes for some good photo ops. You can view the skyline from the top, go to the tapas bar up there also or check out the market in the base of it and even the recently excavated Roman ruins underneath it.

If wine's your thing drink some sherry from Jerez. Dry or sweet. Bars in Feria and La Alameda will almost always have it.

If you want to see flamenco, go to El Carbon. It can be a little bit touristy but it's not horrible. Kind of hidden actually. Good bar but not good tapas. Stay after the main show for some fun singing and dancing.

Everyone visits the Cathedral. Go early to avoid the lines. Right next door is the Arabian palace with it's English Garden. Going to these two things will take up a large portion of your day unless you rush through.

If a restaurant or bar has no outside seating, usually avoid it -it's probably an indicator that they don't cater to locals. Unless there's a massive crowd. Then it's likely to be good.

Not counting breakfast, if it serves food before 2pm it's probably a tourist spot. If it serves food after 4pm it's either a tourist spot or a place to get a snack or hot chocolate (although in the summer not so much). Dinner before 9 or 10 is probably a tourist spot also. These things aren't written in stone, though.

I haven't found good consistent music that isn't Spanish or pop disco, so good luck and if you find something send me a private message. I come from a city with a huge live music culture so that's been a little hard on me here. The only rock/jazz/electronic stuff I've found have been private shows.

If you want to go to the beach and Cadiz doesn't sound like your thing (although personally, I think Cadiz is neat to visit) then try beaches around Jerez. I hear it's better there from the Sevilla locals I know but a little more windy.

I haven't been yet but I hear there's a bus that takes you to Portugal in an hour. It'll be the nearest border town on the Portugal side (I forget the name at the moment).

Einfuhrumsatzsteuer und Zölle nachzahlen, als Politiker Stellungnahme, Asche aufs Haupt und nie wieder, und gut ist. 

&gt; Der SPD-Politiker Raabe warf Niebel vor, einen privaten Teppich auf Staatskosten eingeflogen zu haben. 

Sachlich richtig, die Frage ist aber, ob (a) Her Niebel dem Herrn Schindler gegenüber weisungsberechtigt ist, oder (b) dem Herrn Schindler für den Transport eines Teppichs Kosten in Rechnung gestellt werden würden. 

&gt; Es handele sich dabei nicht um eine Lappalie, zumal Teppiche in Afghanistan meist mit Kinderarbeit hergestellt würden

OMG WAHWAHWAH - das ist nun wirklich ein Schmutzanwurf.

&gt; Die Grünen-Politikerin Ute Koczy bezeichnete die ausgebliebene Verzollung als „politische Dummheit“. Der politische Schaden sei groß. So stelle sich die Frage, warum dem Minister nicht aufgefallen sei, dass er seine Privilegien missbrauche. Er müsse sich auch fragen, wie bindend das Konzept seines Hauses gegen Korruption für ihn selbst sei.

Das kommt meinen Ansichten schon näher.

true,ffill,GREE,Greece,"The 20th anniversary of the signing of the Maastricht treaty passed largely unremarked on Tuesday as the crisis in the eurozone preoccupied governments and the financial markets. Yet even as negotiations in Athens edged towards Thursday’s agreement on rescheduling the Greek debt burden, the pact that laid the foundations for Europe’s single currency was heralded by Chancellor Angela Merkel in a speech to students.

In an unusually appropriate setting – surrounded by Greek antiquities in the reconstructed Neues Museum in the centre of Berlin – Germany’s normally cautious leader spelt out elements of her vision on how to solve the eurozone crisis long-term.

Much was familiar. Eurozone countries needed both budget austerity to reduce their debts and structural reforms to boost their competitiveness and employment, she said. They needed to recreate trust in their finances and in each other. Then she turned to the construction of the EU. “Without doubt, we need more and not less Europe,” Ms Merkel declared. “That’s why it’s necessary to create a political union, something that wasn’t done when the euro was launched.”

She went on to suggest that this political union – “there will still be a lot of argument about it” – would be organised around the existing bodies of the soon to be 28-nation bloc. The European Commission, the Brussels-based executive arm, would – with competences transferred to it by nation states – act as a government reporting to a strong European parliament. The European Council of national heads of state and government would function as a second legislative chamber; the European Court of Justice would be the highest authority. “We believe that we will stand better together if we are ready to transfer competences step by step to Europe,” she said.

“That is just about as federalist as you can get,” says Henrik Enderlein of the Hertie School of Government in Berlin. “Is she serious? That is the real question. She is very good at the rhetoric. But I do take it seriously that she wants to move towards political union.”

It is a vision that could cause alarm in France, Germany’s closest European ally, even as Ms Merkel has announced her intention to campaign for the re-election of Nicolas Sarkozy as French president. Mr Sarkozy does not want the Commission to become Europe’s government: Paris wants that job to remain with the European Council, where the nation states rule supreme. He is unlikely to be alone.

Hers is a vision that would also imply dramatic changes in the distribution of power between Brussels and member states. Such a big change might require a referendum in Germany itself – something every chancellor since the second world war has sought to avoid.
An alliance normal for the new union

When Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union announced last month that the chancellor will be supporting Nicolas Sarkozy in the forthcoming French presidential election, the news was greeted with astonishment in France – and some surprise in Germany.

Hermann Gröhe, CDU secretary-general, issued an effusive statement stressing the “close and trusting” relationship with Mr Sarkozy’s UMP and fiercely attacking Socialist candidate François Hollande. “We need a strong France with a strong president at its head,” he said.

Some analysts speculated that Mr Gröhe had exceeded his brief. Others fear Ms Merkel’s intervention will encourage Germanophobia in France. But the chancellor seems unruffled: she sees such cross-border canvassing and co-operation as normal in the new, integrated Europe. The CDU and the UMP are both members of the European People’s party, the centre-right grouping that has the biggest share of seats in the European parliament. The leaders of the EPP countries meet before every EU summit to co-ordinate positions.

Ms Merkel believes it is not just at the level of Brussels institutions that alliances matter. “European politics are becoming ever more strongly matters of domestic policy,” she told a meeting at Berlin’s Neues Museum, organised by the Bela Foundation for young European leaders. “Europe’s economies are so closely meshed in the internal market, and even more through the euro, that economic developments and political decisions in one country always – today more than ever – affect other countries as well.” Leaders, she says, need to understand – and express an opinion about – what is happening in other eurozone countries.

“The French elections matter for Germany,” says Ulrike Guérot of the European Council on Foreign Relations. Nor is it the first time that leaders have campaigned across borders. French president François Mitterrand addressed the Bundestag, urging support for the installation of Pershing missiles on German soil. Helmut Kohl as German chancellor campaigned with Mitterrand in support of the Maastricht treaty that founded the euro.

But, according to Ms Guérot, the German leader should not limit her efforts to France. “I would argue that Ms Merkel should go to Greece,” says Ms Guérot. “We play Greece against Germany. It should not be like that. The Greek conservative party is threatening the reforms Ms Merkel wants to make. She should go and argue her case there, too.”

But what does “political union”, a term abandoned in recent years by most EU leaders for fear of alarming their increasingly eurosceptic electorates, really mean? The detailed vision of Ms Merkel – the continent’s dominant political leader, widely seen as having the future of the euro in her thrall – remains unclear. She talks of a “fiscal union” but her definition sounds like fiscal discipline. She insists there should not be a “transfer union” in which Germany guarantees the borrowings of its partners.",0,1339679769,null,0,false,0,c50hbud,t3_uzrvd,t1_c50hbud,t1_c50dh1f,null,1429141128,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4
true,ffill,GREE,Greece,"From Washington to Westminster, political leaders complain that they understand neither the tactics nor the strategy of the German government and its chancellor in the crisis. They see conflicting signals, ranging from a rigid insistence on budget discipline to a willingness to turn a blind eye to the unorthodox monetary policies of the European Central Bank. Ms Merkel says she will “do what it takes” to save the euro, but then constantly seems to block the view of most partners on the need for a bigger “firewall” to prevent contagion.

Part of the problem lies in the constant debate within Germany, and within Ms Merkel’s centre-right government, about the way forward. A confused communications strategy tries to reconcile the demands of the competing ministries of finance, foreign affairs and the chancellor’s office itself. And Ms Merkel, by training a physical chemist, plays at political alchemy to reconcile a domestic constituency that is essentially pro-European but is decidedly hostile to bailing out the eurozone’s debtor nations.

In countries such as Greece and Spain, undergoing ferocious austerity programmes to meet German-led demands to reduce their public debt and budget deficits, the chancellor is caricatured as a jackbooted bully. Yet at home she is seen as cautious, dedicated to consensus, a leader who is both pragmatic and determined, and a natural conciliator: she is the most popular politician in the country and her Christian Democratic Union is well ahead of its rivals in the polls.

“I don’t think she is a visionary, and we don’t want a visionary in Germany,” says Almut Möller of DGAP, a German foreign policy institute. “She has no institutional vision.”

Yet the chancellor’s advisers say that has changed. The turning point was last July. “Two things came together,” says Ulrike Guérot of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank. The first was Italy, which came under attack from financial markets almost as soon as EU leaders had finalised an agreement aimed at promoting calm. Then, pro-Europeans in the CDU warned that Ms Merkel was in danger of losing the debate in Germany. “They said: we are losing our constituency in the centre and not gaining anything on the right.”

There was also a realisation among party officials that the chancellor would have to take a series of tough bills through the Bundestag to pay for eurozone rescue plans and needed a narrative to persuade her sceptical supporters. “For the Germans the message has to be: if we are going to have a transfer union anyway, we need a political union to control things,” says Daniela Schwarzer of SWP, the German institute for international and security affairs.

Close advisers confirm that the chancellor has indeed been thinking long and hard about reforms of the EU that go far beyond the recent “fiscal compact” of budgetary rules agreed as an intergovernmental treaty last month by 25 of the 27 members.

At a recent meeting with three fellow European leaders at Schloss Meseberg, her baroque government retreat outside Berlin, she urged them to spell out their ideas of how the EU should look in 10 years’ time. To her obvious frustration, they were all much more focused on the present crisis. Yet she gave only hints of her own thinking in a series of statements and speeches. “She is quite clever in not spelling it out,” says Joachim Fritz-Vannahme of the Europe’s Future programme at the Bertelsmann foundation. “She is playing chess. She knows what she has to do. She knows it will take time. And she knows it will be very controversial.”

It is, he adds, “a vision for the transformation of the EU – or at least the eurozone – in a very short time frame: three to five years. Political union is not a very clear concept. She doesn’t dare speak about a United States of Europe, but she is thinking about what has to be in it.”

Conversations with senior officials and political analysts in Berlin reveal a lot more detailed thinking than Ms Merkel has demonstrated publicly.

The “fiscal compact” is seen as just a first step to make the rules of budget discipline genuinely binding on all eurozone members: they must put a commitment to balanced budgets into their national constitutions, or equivalent legislation. In exchange, Germany proposed and is the principal financier of the permanent European Stability Mechanism, due to start operating in July. It is in effect a €500bn European monetary fund to deal with debt crises in the 17-member monetary union.

The rules agreed would set ceilings for national spending and borrowing but would not interfere with tax and spending choices. But the next phase contemplated in Berlin would be more intrusive: co-ordinating or even harmonising taxes, with budgets supervised by the Commission and all eurozone finance ministers. They would be able to insist on certain spending priorities, to ensure competitiveness and growth targets were met and that adequate funds were devoted to areas such as education. It would mean a big transfer of sovereignty away from national capitals and parliaments.

At that stage, many leading German officials and politicians privately concede, the introduction of jointly guaranteed eurobonds might be possible, even irresistible. The concept would provide cheaper financing for the most indebted eurozone states. It is still fiercely resisted in Ms Merkel’s CDU and by the liberal Free Democrats, junior partner in the coalition. The chancellor herself sounds sceptical. But Wolfgang Schäuble, her passionately pro-European finance minister, has always said “not yet” rather than “never” to the bonds. (Both the main opposition parties, the centre-left Social Democrats and the environmentalist Greens, are in favour.)

Yet eurobonds and a loss of budgetary autonomy would be likely to fall foul of the constitutional court. “Any loss of sovereignty would be problematic” for the court, says Ms Schwarzer. “It would probably mean having a referendum. But the big problem for Germany isn’t just the constitutional court: it’s also Paris.”

Confrontation with France could come in a third phase of EU reforms, in which the Commission would become the real European economic government and the European Council would become a legislature alongside the European parliament. “The reality is that Germany is starting this reflection and other countries are not,” says Ms Guérot. “France has to have the debate. They are not ready to give up the Fifth Republic.”

For Ms Merkel it is a question of the democratic legitimacy of the entire integration process. She sees a dangerous disconnection between national politics, and national parliaments, and the European parliament. Her party wants to see the Commission president directly elected.

The chancellor knows perfectly well that these are profoundly important political issues, and hugely controversial. But she has decided that only with such fundamental reforms can European monetary union survive.

The good thing for Germany, says Mr Fritz-Vannahme, is that she is not a bully – in spite of the Mediterranean caricatures. “She is a lady, but not an iron lady,” he says. “She is also a scientist, and that is perhaps part of her problem. For politics is not an exact science.”",0,1339679777,null,0,false,0,c50hbw5,t3_uzrvd,t1_c50hbw5,t1_c50hbud,null,1429141129,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"There's no racism involved.  Yet another thinly disguised attempt to shut down any criticism of German economic imperialism.

Your comparisons of my responses to Britain being expected to stump up money to support the Eurozone and Germany doing the same are ridiculous.  Germany has benefited enormously from their membership of the Eurozone, and many of the policies that the ECB took on to help the German economy when it was in the doldrums in the early years of the Eurozone were a direct cause of the credit bubbles in Ireland and Spain.  Now it's time to pay up for that benefit, they're essentially dragging their feet and allowing Southern Europe to burn.  Britain's not even in the Eurozone, yet even so we're almost unilaterally bailing out Ireland, so kindly STFU.  It's like comparing apples to oranges, yet even more misguided than your usual comparisons.  How about like spaceships to unicorns?  No, I don't think even that suffices.

Further, I don't think I've mentioned Greece at all in my posting in this thread.  Greece is a *sui generis* case which is being used by Germany as a fig leaf to enact their damaging austerity agenda across the whole of Southern Europe and Ireland by convincing everybody that people in e.g. Spain are lazy, workshy tax avoiders who deserve their fate.  No mention of the fact that by many accounts Spain had better e.g. public debt figures than Germany itself prior to the crisis is tolerated (watch the downvote patterns of any submission that comes anywhere close to suggesting this) and that the crisis in Spain is not caused by the same thing as the crisis in Greece.  The message must be hammered home.  No deviation from the plan is acceptable.  We must succeed at all costs.

Our German posters can downvote all they want.  Everybody knows that Germany and its outsize influence in the ECB has had a large hand in creating this crisis, and their intransigence and inflexibility has had a large hand in dragging it out and presumably will continue to do so for the next few years at least.",0,1339680758,null,0,1339681057,0,c50hhjx,t3_v1h56,t1_c50hhjx,t1_c50haue,null,1429141202,-21,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-21

 Hello, users, I am the unofficial SRD ambassdor bot, here to quickly explain exactly what SubredditDrama is.


/r/SubredditDrama (SRD) is a meta subreddit dedicated to aggregating the drama on Reddit strictly for observing and discussing. Although the bot above, sieglinde_hofmann, would like you to think that SRD is an invasion subreddit, drama is never submitted to SRD for the purposes of causing drama or swaying discussions in their favor. That would kind of defeat the purpose of observing drama anyways.

This is not true at all.  There is no country in the Eurozone that would have accepted a full political union straight off the bat.  Part of the reason for German intransigence today is with the German public's displeasure at the idea of setting up a permanent transfer union with Southern Europe, yet now you're trying to tell me that, if it wasn't for the UK, this would have happened?  It was just not politically feasible at all.

On this issue, no.  The Euro will impoverish more Europeans than anything since WW2.  It already is, to a certain extent.  There's veritable Nazis in national governments, people self immolating and mass unemployment.  There's things that you can get a pass on for being wrong.

The rest of the world (outside EU and USA) have been doing rather well for themselves over the last decade, and if you need a special kind of high pressure tube, there's only one (German) company that can build it for you - stuff like that...

Germany also started from a less ""communist"" position when they began the reforms. Tax evasion, shadow economy are much smaller problems in Germany as well.

Wasn't necessary. You shouldn't compare austerity measures now vs no austerity measures if Germans gave a quarter of their salaries to Southern Europe for the next 100 years.

Instead compare austerity measures now vs what would be necessary if these countries defaulted. Look at Argentina, they were in a much better position when they defaulted, and they're already close to another collapse.

Yes. I hate that, too.

In essence, Germany got lucky - if the German economy had been fine in 2000 there would have been no reforms, and there would have been a German bubble just as bad as the others.

The solar power subsidies are the closest to that in Germany - a huge waste of resources with very little to show for it - but of course they are an annual cost for the average Germans to the benefit of the top 1%, not some huge cost that caught everyone by surprise in 2010.

2) Pre-euro sytle - Many different national currencies and budgets, with some amount of shared EU-wide legislation.  You could argue for either more or less shared laws, but ultimately the EU would be a supranational organisation, rather than a superstate.  
3) Further financial integration - The eurozone (but not *necessarily* the EU as a whole) acts as a single financial zone, with shared budgets and eurobonds completely replacing national equivalents.  But individual countries are still separate entities.  
4) Complete federalisation - A true United States of Europe, with a single European nationality for member states.

The markets don't trust Greece, but they trust Germany (at least until a few months ago) to try and keep the EUR as stable as possible. In fact, Germany's preferred monetary policy - where the main goal is keeping inflation low - is achieving exactly the opposite of what you claim they want.

EUR went down the last few months but it is still overvalued vs the USD (at least by purchasing parity standards). Chinese currency is kept in a slowly increasing exchange rate vs the USD (and a lot of currencies are tied to USD one way or another).

For example, this summer employers are required to pay the same salary to any worker, regardless of country of origin. This costs our society money, but in a way that benefits eastern workers (they earn more) and our own (there will be less incentive to give the jobs to easterners because the financial advantage is gone).

The Human Rights Act is pretty controversial in the UK particularly because English law places a huge emphasis on individual rights. One example would be that of wills. Court cases where family sue mistresses simply don't happen because the right of an individual to leave money to whom they want is considered more important than a societal obligation. If you are in business you will find that a lot of contracts specify UK law and arbitration be used if a problem arises. 

 The Human Rights Act is seen to add little and sections of it are often interpreted by Judges in extraordinary ways. Burgers are given to suspects camped on roofs to escape police and terror suspects are able to stay in the UK despite inciting hatred and violence, often at considerable public expense, as a result of the act. The British home secretary Theresa May discussed scrapping it last year – it is a regular theme in British politics and even three days ago she demanded that judges toughen up or she would change the law. 

The UK has a problem with immigration which exploded when the new member states joined the EU. A small country simply cannot take in hundreds of thousands of low-skilled workers. Once again the conservative government has tried to tighten up rules and Ed Miliband leader of the (left wing) Labour party admitted that allowing workers from the EU member states to enter the country en mass was a mistake. Hostility towards immigrants is different from scepticism about immigration. I have never ever heard a UKIP politician be hostile towards immigrants.

Leaving the EU is more about adhering to the free-market tradition of the Treaty of Rome. UKIP  stand for a trading block but no or little requisition of sovereign power. Similar to the Norwegian or Swiss relationship with Europe. 

Limitations of foreign investments is simply not true. It is very much a free-market party. It would be delighted for any foreign investment in the UK. Furthermore UKIP tend to have an internationalist outlook and UKIP politicians generally push for closer ties to India, Australia and America. 

Increase in Military spending is difficult to imagine if you are from a country not used to military intervention. Increases in military spending were proposed after it was found that British troops were woefully under equipped for missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. “Snatch” land-rovers were death-traps, there weren't enough serviceable helicopters and soldier died after being left without adequate body armour. The argument was that Britain would have to properly fund its armed forces if it wanted to use them. Nowadays you will see them defend defence cuts on the groups that troops who have fought bravely don't deserve to be turfed out of the military. 

A “pure” British culture also isn't true. Nobody living in the UK could ask for such a thing. There is no such thing as “pure” Britishness and I have never ever heard a mainstream politician – with the exception of Gordon Brown – push for it.

true,omargard,null,null,"&gt;In essence, we're discussing what the price of a hypothetical extant DMark would be: cheaper than the Euro, or not? This is the nature of the hypothetical: to what extent has Germany benefited from the weaker countries pulling the currency down.

I'm sure the Drachma would be worth less than the 340:1 EUR from when Greece switched, but the exchange rate of the Euro today depends more on the stable economies than the unstable ones (at least until recently where the market gets a bit nervous that the Euro zone might split up). I'm sure if Germany left the EUR, their ""DM"" would rise vs EUR, but I don't know how much.

In the alternative history where there was no Euro, if the D-Mark became uncomfortably expensive, Germany might actually do what Switzerland has done recently with CHFs: ""print"" and sell DM directly through the Bundesbank, and use that ""free money"" to pay for childcare services or lower taxes...

And I'm not sure how big a problem a higher valued DM would be -- many German exports don't depend crucially on being cheap, if the DM increased 30% this would only reduce BMW revenue by 5% -- because the imports would also be 25% cheaper, Germans buy in DM, and most foreign buyers of BMWs aren't short on cash. Similarly for specialized industrial machines. Of course some businesses would get problems - e.g. airlines (but they already have problems with the EUR as it is), and shops on the German side of the border (Germans living there would just go to France for shopping and pay 25% less).
