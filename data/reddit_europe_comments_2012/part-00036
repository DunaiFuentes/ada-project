&gt; lie in irresponsible parenting from stronger member countries during the eurozone’s infancy.

Oh vaffanculo.  Cazzo.

Jesus H. Christ.  What's he implying, ""weaker"" member countries are immature children?  I guess so.

The Germans, French, and others that flagrantly disregarded the Stability &amp; Growth Pact acted reprehensibly.  There is no excuse for that.  But to blame them is retarded and utterly unworthy of someone of Monti's undoubted qualifications.

And as far as the German violation goes - the SGP specified deficits of no more than 3%.  Germany, while still paying for the integration of DDR (and arguably helping to keep Poland, the Czechs, and other Eastern countries economically stable), ran....wait for it...3.3%.  Even the Netherlands, one of the more responsible Euro countries, ran higher % deficits than that.

As for government debt, a certain former economics professor seems to have forgotten that debt per se is not a bad thing, particularly if coupled with overall economic stability.  In Germany's case, ~80%, while still an inexcusable violation of a treaty, was understandable.  France's was less than that.

Let me ask a few questions:


How can you characterize the UN's involvement in Korea as the *US expanding and consolidating its influence* when it was the Communists that invaded the South and it was the Communists that occupied eastern Europe? 

What supporting evidence do you have for the statement *the US forces others to join in on their wars*? When did this  happen? 


How can you balance the statement EU *had little interest in Korea* when France fought a war in SE Asia and the UK as well as the Dutch still had holdings that they were willing to defend with force? Would this not equate interests? If they were not interested, why did nations like Turkey and Greece commit troops if not concerned about the spread of Communism? US force compelled them?

NO ""CHEATING""!

(Sorry it seems to be ignoring my giant spoiler tag.)

[Which option seems the most informal?  ""I'm running out of time."" (ish, ""I don't have any time left."" is kind of the same).

""I threw up."" means: I puked.

Which sounds better? None of them! ""I drank out all the juice"" is definitely wrong. The other two sound weird. It should be ""I drank all the juice.""

Which doesn't work?  I skimmed at the bank.

Which one works the least?  He turned abruptly off the light.

In the incomplete sentence ""Sam threw out."" where should ""it"" go? Sam threw it out.

Which sounds better without context? The car broke down.

Which one doesn't sound grammatical? ""How can you put up her?"". ""I'll go in on some pizza."" is a slightly weird Americanism, but ok, it means ""I will join this group pizza purchase.""

Which one doesn't belong? You had better make sure to check out in the yard. (A clever and sneaky question.)

Which one is the least grammatical? ""Alex paid his mortgage to the bank back."" But actually they are *all* grammatically correct. This one is wrong because it has ""mortgage to the bank"" as a noun (or subject or whatever), but mortgages are *from* banks. I suppose you could say it is a grammatical failure to convey a sensible meaning. Allora...

Which of the following is more informal? I have no idea! ""He ran up the bill."" is extremely American... I am English so never say it. I'd guess it is informal.

In the incomplete sentence ""She threw out"" where can ""the garbage"" go? ""She threw out the garbage."", ""She threw the garbage out."" are correct complete sentences. ""the garbage she threw out"" is an object (or something), but not a complete sentence.

Which is the least grammatical? He caught to the truck up. (Damn those phrasal verbs!)

Which one is ungrammatical? Did you clock up? 

Which one doesn't belong? Put your laundry into the dryer. (I think. Because it *isn't* a phrasal verb.)](/spoiler)

&gt; How can you characterize the UN's involvement in Korea as the US expanding and consolidating its influence when it was the Communists that invaded the South and it was the Communists that occupied eastern Europe?

The communists invaded the South that was *de facto* already ""occupied"" by Americans forces after the USSR and the USA divided Korea in half after the Japanese surrendered. The situation was at an impasse that was deliberately kept unstable in hopes for a chance to unify Korea under a single (capitalist!) banner. When the North attacked the USA seized the opportunity and retaliated in force. A plan that was successful until the Chinese joined in and drove them back over the 38th parallel and the current stalemate was instated. The communists only occupied Eastern Europe in the same sense that the Americans occupied Western Europe. Don't forget that anti-communist propaganda in the West was equaled word-for-word in the East.

&gt; What supporting evidence do you have for the statement the US forces others to join in on their wars? When did this happen?

Remember the Irak-war? How the French refused? Americans still speak of the French as though they are cowards, despite the fact that the French have both fought and won more wars than the USA, go figure! We've already touched upon the threat to withhold Marshal aid if countries refused to join in the Korean war. 

&gt; How can you balance the statement EU had little interest in Korea when France fought a war in SE Asia and the UK as well as the Dutch still had holdings that they were willing to defend with force? Would this not equate interests? If they were not interested, why did nations like Turkey and Greece commit troops if not concerned about the spread of Communism? US force compelled them?

South-East Asia is a long way from Korea... The fact that Indochina was once a French colony has no connection whatsoever to Korea. The UK and NL had colonies and holdings in Indonesia, Birma (then Ceylon) and India, again none of these are even *near* Korea, to suggest a link merely based on the geographical fact that all these countries are in Asia is ridiculous. Turkey and Greece were compelled most likely by the inane argument that we hear repeated endlessly nowadays in Afghanistan. If all NATO members are sending forces the exceptions will be frowned upon, in international relations that can be cause to deny a country a seat in the G-20, such threats hold a considerable amount of influence. So to answer your last question, yes.

Your argument basically boils down to the idea that you shouldn't have to consult the map? That's the least logical thing I've heard. I don't see how adding directions help anything.

One of the many advantages of the U-Bahn is that it doesn't do asinine things like splitting into lines.

You might have to start from scratch. This is the website they constantly refer me to (I've been trying to get into German universities forever and I've been constantly rejected. Probably due to my somewhat incomplete high school diploma). Anyway, it says [here](http://www.anabin.de/Xml/xmlZeugnis.asp?ID=1603&amp;Land=124&amp;Mode=BV) that your associate's will need to have five general subjects including English, a foreign language, math, and natural science. I'm not sure what the specifics on this is but if all fails and they don't want to consider your time already spent in university, you could simply apply with your high school diploma and still get into a 3-year bachelor degree program. You'd just have to start over and scrap the work that went into your time already spent in college.
Now, in addition to your high school diploma, they're going to want to see proof of proficiency in German. There are two tests you can take - DSH (Goethe Institut or Die Neue Schule in Berlin) and TestDaF. I took TestDaF to qualify for study in Germany you need at least 4 points in each of the areas on the exam: speaking, reading, writing, and listening. This is the ""C2"" level. When I took the test I got 4 in all categories except reading (got a 3 damn it). So yeah, that fucked me over, plus I was missing an entire year of high school (spent a year in Germany instead) and they didn't accept a GED or even a high school diploma issued after the GED. I don't know. Shit got fucked. Anyway, yeah, so if your German isn't that great they have ""Vorbereitungskurse"" for foreign students who need to learn German in order to pass these tests so they can study as soon as possible. You can take a semester or two of that then start studying.

In terms of academic standing... with a 3.0 you might have to take something called the ""Feststellungsprüfung"" which may test your knowledge of math or other various subjects. You might also have to do the Studienkolleg thing which sort of introduces you to how the university and lectures function, etc. It helps if you have good ACT and/or SAT scores. ACT score of 28 or higher means you don't have to do deal with a Feststellungsprüfung or even a Studienkolleg. The site I provided gives more info on other test scores that might help. AP courses help too.

Anyway, GOOD LUCK!

EDIT: Also I just wanted to suggest a program I know of called CBYX (Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange) which is awesome because (to my knowledge) the German government PAYS you to live in Germany, study there, and also take on an internship. I believe you get €750 per month. I'm applying for this in December.

Ill be upfront and tell you my opinion. 

The way I see it, you are dangerously close to making the textbook mistake of looking at history through a modern lens, or the larger mistake of intentionally going back through time and revising history to prove your opinion about a modern issue. 

Whatever criticisms I might have about current US foreign policy, I do not fault the US/UN for acting in Korea.  The world had just lost tens of millions people because it had sat idly by while belligerent nations invaded their neighbors. The West, as a whole, had a moral obligation to react to NK's unprovoked aggression. The current state of affairs in Korea only goes to illustrate that they made the right choice.


But to answer you:

First, its difficult to accept your suggestion that the US was trying *unify Korea under a single (capitalist!) banner*. 
The US had pretty much no forces in Korea in 1950. They were entirely unprepared. Yet, it was NK that launched an invasion. Who had plans?

Second, ""no"" the US did not occupy Western Europe in the *same way* the Communists occupied the East. That is an absurd statement. The two occupations were light years apart.  I think you already know that. 


Third, France and the Irak War?

Thats your example? You must be joking. Some jackasses on TV making jokes about the French does not equal *the US forcing others to join in on their wars*. Again, who did the US force into going to war for them? When did this happen?

&gt;*most likely by the inane argument that we hear repeated endlessly nowadays in Afghanistan*

What?  Who says this? Who has been punished for not honoring their NATO obligations in Astan?  What country? How?


&gt;""The imposition of political views out of economical interest""

This intentionally ambiguous statement describes NK better than the UN, regardless, it does not support your comparison, at all.

Grillen: important as everywhere in Germany. Thüringer Bratwurst, marinated steaks, Schaschlik and vegetable ""schaschlik"", something very regional called ""Mutzbraten"" which is a heavily spiced hunk of pig meat and eaten with Sauerkraut. There's also potato and pasta salads.  
Home cooking: typical 3 component meals (grain/carbohydrate, vegetable, meat/protein, usually with a sauce), gratins, homemade pizza, pasta dishes, Eintopf (basically a stew with veggies/legumes, with or without meat).  
Breakfast: different kinds of Brötchen and things to put on them, very much like bluemli described. This happens every weekend day.  
Dinner: much like breakfast, but without the sweet spreads, and with regular bread instead of Brötchen. My mum would often serve some raw veggies and/or fruit, too. On weekends we would have cooked meals for dinner instead of this.  
Holiday foods: Christmas eve - potato salad and Weißwurst. 1. Christmas day - some kind of bird, Thüringer Klöße (kinda potato dumplings with roasted bread inside), Rotkraut (cooked red cabbage spiced with cloves). 2. Christmas day - fish, typically a carp, with potatoes.  
Kaffeetrinken - a version of tea time, in the afternoon on weekends. Coffee and homemade cakes/cookies (on weekends we would have a late breakfast, no lunch, then Kaffeetrinken, and cooked dinner).  

So I've been a vegetarian for some time (we have some 5% vegetarians and something below 1% vegans) and I've also lived in a big city for several years now. My whole food situation is a little more international now:  
City meals/snacks: Chinese, Indian, Turkish/Arabic, Thai, Italian take outs/restaurants. There are a lot of bakeries that sell Belegte Brötchen (Brötchen with stuff on them, like a sandwich) and other baked goods. [There are also the typical fast food things (McD, Subway..)]  
Home cooking: much like the things I wrote earlier, only with more internationally inspired dishes and of course vegetarian versions. I still make 3-component-meals quite often.  
Holiday foods nowadays: We still have the potato salad and Weißwurst, only that they are vegan now. 1. Christmas day has some kind of slightly fancy veggie dish or the Klöße and Rotkraut with a vegetarian protein. 2. Christmas day is now for tons of homemade vegan sushi, in my opinion a big improvement over the icky carp!  
Breakfast: also a lot like the things already mentioned (jellies/jams, chocolate spreads, honey), vegan savoury spreads (store bought or home made, like hummus or avocado spread), cold cuts (store bought) and the occasional vegan cheese. Also occasionally we have pancakes instead.",0,1333197451,null,0,false,0,c46ymsm,t3_rlua6,t1_c46ymsm,t3_rlua6,null,1428629231,8,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,8

If you don't have a car, you'll want to move from the residence really fast as there is almost nothing to do in Sophia Antipolis.

The Antibes/Juan les Pins region is okay, but it gets super crowded with tourists during the summer and fades into limbo after October. And you only have a few places worth going out to, compared to the old town in Nice which is packed with bars, clubs, and restaurants.

During my internship, I found a shared appartment in Nice with 4 other students. You've got all the bars and restaurants close by, and can still go to the beaches easily. I paid around 400€ for my room over there (which is about what you would pay for the same thing in Antibes or Juan les Pins, so no real financial difference between the two). 

One I started my current job though, I took my own place in Antibes in a residence with swimming pool and tennis courts. That was fun for a while, but needing to take the car all the time got annoying, and so I moved back to Nice after a few months. So I know both pretty well :)

As for transport, there is a bus from Nice to Sophia which costs 20€ / month, and takes about 45 minutes. Antibes might seem closer, but there are so many traffic jams that the bus takes ~35 minutes as well!

The best place to look if you want housemates is on www.appartager.com . If you want to be alone however, try www.leboncoin.fr .

PM me if you've got specific questions on the company or the region!

Look at you own country. Absence of a common identity among people governed as a single society creates tension and weakens the group. There is natural tendency for such groups to divide into more coherent parts.

Lack of a common identity of a group makes it difficult to define common goals and pursue ambitious endeavours, which often require solidarity and sacrifices from individuals for the sake of the group - and why would they agree to that if they don't identify with it?

Oh, completely agreed. 

I'm saying that for a democratic political system to be effective and stable, the participants must have some common identity. An artificial government that is born on only pragmatic grounds and manages a group that doesn't have a common cultural identity, is bound to fail due to internal tensions in the group. 

I *did not* mean to imply the government can or should determine that common identity. It's the other way around - people who have things in common want to be autonomous and create a government.

So where does this leave the EU which was created somewhat artificially, top-to-bottom? 

Well, I think that, while the government can't just synthetically make up an identity, it can help promote certain threads people have in common that already exist organically. Europeans do have many things in common that can become a basis for an identity that would ensure EU's political longevity.

I don't know if applying is any different with an associates degree (another user here linked some helpful stuff on this).

Now starting from scratch, to be accepted immediately you need a decent GPA + SATs and a certificate in German language. What might be possible for you is applying as an overseas transfer student. This I have no info on though.
 If you dont have all these you can attend the Studienkolleg for 1-2 Semester. You will attend courses based on what you want to major in later. Once you pass the Feststellungsprüfung at the Studienkolleg you are qualified to attend any University. To attend Studienkolleg you only need a High School diploma. This would take a year longer than a more direct route though. The Studienkolleg does have the advantage of not having to test your German at a university level right away. Your first year in a new country would also be far more relaxed.

All this ""bailout"" does is give cash to greece which then immediately goes back to the lenders on past interests made when the EUro currency was created.

If we were like France and refused to learn another language (or Italy etc) what could we do? We couldn't make business deals without a translator and all that hassle. We couldn't study abroad. We could barely study at home. I studied physics, math and CS. Computer books are outdated when they are translated, a book in quantum physics would cost a fortune translated if anyone even bothered. In university, 20 years ago if we had 1 non swedish speaker, the whole class was in English.

I have worked as a programmer for almost 20 years, I have never commented code in Swedish, and I have seldom written one document in Swedish. In fact where I work now, it is a Norwegian company everyone I work with is Norwegian but all documentation etc is in English. It may be absurd but I present a monthly report written in English to all Norwegian speakers and we all talk in Norwegian. This is however normal.

If an american, brit or whatever has lived here for 10 years without learning Norwegian, it is normal. In fact if he has learned it, we all compliment him (I'm secretely annoyed because they are so gooddamn lazy but what can you do).

Universities distribute their slots for foreign students by countries. So you might get in with shitty grades because there are few Americans applying that semester. Or you dont get in with good grades because there are so many other Americans with perfect grades. Bit of and odd system. I wouldnt worry about an overflow of US students though. So chances should be good.
Which majors are free and which are limited is mostly the same at the every uni since it goes by popularity or more specific limitations (medical school for example).
Biology, business and graphics design are all limited admissions at my Uni. Dont let it discourage you though. You can apply at as a many unis as you want after STK. Or apply for a related free major as a backup plan and then switch majors and transfer credits. Something will turn up!

Edit: Not dodging the question. I just dont have any experience outside my own city/uni.

To put your mind at ease, a translation from a German document I found at [http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/archive/policy/consult/ebs_de.pdf](http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/archive/policy/consult/ebs_de.pdf) (page 3):

""The first foreign language in Europe is EN: 32.6% of Europeans state English as their second language. [...]
The second foreign language in Europe is FR (9.5%). In UK, Ireland and Luxembourg French is the first foreign language. [...]
In 3rd and 4th place are D (4.2%) and ES (1.5%)""

The figures are from 2000, so a bit dated. But I think we can safely assume that there hasn't been too much of a drastic change in the numbers since then? I mean English had a solid 23.1% lead on French in terms of first foreign language. And the overall number of English speakers seems to have risen from 40.5% to 51%.

What we need to do is create the circumstances for Europeans to visit, go to university, live, have children in each others' countries, and a common identity will continue to emerge. I am fully behind that- Erasmus programmes, encouraging language learning, exchange programmes, and simply informing people about the opportunities they do have to live and work elsewhere in Europe. I myself have recently realized the opportunities which are available, and am trying to pick up a bit more French and German so that I can make use of that option in the future.

But this talk- about recontructing history to stabilize identity, essentially to pursue the political aim of faster and more harmonized European integration- I find to be frankly disturbing. It sounds like an attempt to replicate the nationalist ideology which we have just managed to start leaving behind. And it also strikes me as a dangerous politicization of the academic process, which in fact goes beyond what is permitted in nation states. Britain does not fund the British museum on the basis that it acts as an organ for the stabilization of the nation state, essentially for propaganda. What goes in British museums is decided by largely independent academic historians and curators. If it emerged that the government was directly interfering  in this process for political reasons it would be an enormous scandal. I dislike over the top rhetoric about europe, and am broadly in favour of the EU, but these tactics do honestly seem like those associated with dictatorships.

Professor Bumblauskas was the only one to oppose these views, but his ideas, sadly, were met with severe booing. The reason for this (and also most of the past, current and future tensions between our countries) is the result of the aftermath of world war I and how our countries were established: the scars of Polish-Lithuanian war and occupation of Vilnius along with the nationalist doctrine of our authoritarian leader A. Smetona still lives on in our darn history books. 

Our Polish community does an excellent job at alienating Poles and Lithuanians (funny thing is that all my Polish friends distance themselves from it) so all of these things I mentioned contribute to the public opinion that all stuff related to Poland (including the people) is wicked and should be met with suspicion.",0,1333234767,null,0,false,0,c473lr7,t3_rjx18,t1_c473lr7,t1_c470uks,null,1428631588,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
