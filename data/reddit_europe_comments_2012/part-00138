true,_sik,FINL,Finland,"Isn't the usual formulation of this that just being doubtful about the benefits of immigration is a taboo, and that the 'tolerantsia' is too mean to you if you are? I don't really buy that argument in the first place, because at least in my country people have discussed this over and over and there are lots of political channels open for people. I didn't agree with the Halla-Aho verdict, but that's about the only evidence that would support this theory in Finland's case.

What you're saying is a whole one two three steps ahead of all that. ""Seeing nothing good in multiculturalism"" is an extreme monoculturalist position, and I doubt that there are many who hold that view. Perhaps you live in a bubble of like minded thinkers (aka circlejerk, to use the proper reddit lingo) where that isn't such a rare thing, but then I'd recommend you to widen your social circles. Your semi-oblique references to Nazi Germany (that steam boiler thing is like something of a war documentary for heaven's sake) might be intended to give your argument some credibility, but they just make it fall flat on its face, because they're so out there.

And finally that 'we don't hear the story of these people' thing. Let me tell you why: because they don't have a cogent argument.

I think it's should be custom for the media to give quotes and report about things that've happened. If they were to cut out the profanity i would not see the point in why he doesn't play. It would sound like: Cole said something that upsetted other and it may upset our readers so you will never know (because we decided you are not able to handle such things) and you just need to no: Cole won't play. 

Just looked up profanity:  Profanity can take the form of words, expressions, gestures (such as flipping the middle finger), or other social behaviors that are construed or interpreted as insulting, rude, vulgar, obscene, obnoxious, foul, desecrating, or other forms.[1]

So if you suggest to cut profanity... you suggest they shouldn't have covered this and instead should show a picture of a cat?

I don't necessarily agree, but perhaps the fixation on austerity wasn't the best thing for all parties concerned (including Germany).

Of course most of the problem lies with our own politicians, which prefer maintaining the status quo of having way too many public servants that do way too little work. This is showcased by the recent term ""equivalent measures"", meaning ""we won't fire public servants, but we will use equivalent measures, i.e. reducing salaries and pensions"". Still, I don't think firing so many public servants (with no real marketable skills) is going to be beneficial to the economy.

To have planned a policy that is procyclical, to put it mildly. Austerity had the only consequence to deepen the crisis. And limit the role of the ECB was detrimental. What Greece (and Europe!) needed was a Quantitative Easing FED-style.

In fact Merkel was wrong, and recently she had to reviews her position on many things. Now the ECB can work as a lender of last resort, but it's too late.

OK, there are a few exceptions to the rule, but in most cases people are not allowed to get multiple citizenships. What was your point again?

&gt; That reason certainly isn't because someone pre-judged about your personal commitment.

It is an example. Like marriage, the point of a citizenship is not just to make you eligible for the benefits that come with it, it is a contract of commitment.

Apart from all this, I read american newspapers (even paper ones, I have a subscription of TIME) and watch american news. I'd say I'm very well researched and educated on this topic.

And believe you me, I know what I'm talking about. Take the safety. It's extremely dangerous in the states, everywhere. Relative to Europe mind you. But when you come to a city like New Orleans, you just can't believe the shit. It's like a warzone. Though I have to say I loved the city, it's marvellous, and the jazz, oh god!

Now let's take education. I don't take it away from you that you have some of the best universities in the world. But that's about it. Your elementary school system is failing, look at statistics of proficiency of elementary and HS US students on the international scale. They fail hard. And then take Universities. Thay're RIDICULOUSLY expensive, no such thing here in Europe. You have a HUGE higher education bubble and it's hurting every student in the US, it's ridiculous.

Now let's take infrastructure. Well, you have very little. Your highways aren't bad, really, but compare nowhere close to Germany, Netherlands etc. But that's not what's the problem. Public transportation is. Beyond NYC and Chicago, there is none. And it's hurting people badly.

Heathcare? Wow, you don't really mean that, do you? When 50 million people out of 300 are uninsured, and the costs are skyrocketing WAY past inflation, how can you even say that? Compare it to almost any European health care, and you will lose hard. Yes, you might have better machines and more top notch technology, but only very few people benefit from it.

Benefits are very difficult to claim even for natives; becoming resident and eligible for benefits is quite a fair process, and those who need benefits and have contributed will tend to get them.

Honestly, car rental is, by far, the easiest way.  

By public transit, it's hard, I'm telling you now. It's long too.

Anyway, here goes:  
From Brindisi, you would have to [take the train](http://www.trenitalia.com/) (there are plenty of options here...) to S. Severo. The most time effective train, in my opinion, for the cost, is the InterCity or the InterCityNotte. It's not the fastest route, about 3 hours, but it's direct. So no switching trains in Foggia or Bari. It runs about 26eur.

Once in S. Severo, you can take the [Ferrovie del Gargano](http://www.ferroviedelgargano.com) train. There are trains that leave every day. But I don't know when you are going, the schedule changes all the time based on time of year. The best schedule I've found so far is [this](http://www.bus.it/autolinee_locali_fdg/8_vie_sev.htm).  
This route is a bit tricky though and long! (about another 3 hours... not sure on the cost).

Another route you can go is through Foggia, then by Bus.  
**Actually, I've been looking into it now and this seems to be your best bet.**  
I would take the train to Foggia from Brindisi. You can get a ticket on the FrecciaBianca for like 9eur. It's a 2 hour trip.  
Then from Foggia, you can take any number of buses to Vieste. There are a few SITA buses that take you there. You can check out this [link](http://www.sitabus.it/sitapuglia/OrariPuglia/FOGGIA/744-08A.pdf) for schedules. It's another 3 hours. So this route is actually faster than going through S. Severo. Plus you have more flexibility with times by taking the bus.

I hope this helps!

true,pluis,NETH,The Netherlands,"It means that since humans all have a certain cultural background we all tend to judge other cultures from said cultural background. I think that is an all-around bad idea, because this leads to a distorted view of a culture. Let's use an oversimplified analogy: 

My daily food is sauerkraut. Your daily food is bananas. We both taste a grapefruit. I say the grapefruit is disgustingly sweet, you say the grapefruit is acidic and bitter. Next thing you know, we're setting cars on fire because you think I am a filthy grapefruit pusher and I think you're a disrespectful asshole unwilling to try anything outside your comfort zone.

Now, we can objectively establish the amount of sugar in a grapefruit and rank it according to sweetness (and health benefit). However, we cannot objectively measure the amount of 'good' (or 'bad') within a culture. When judging cultures or systems in which multiple cultures are present, we need to remember that and realize that while another culture (or another system) may seem 'bad' to us, it may only appear so because of what we're used to. 

Cultures cannot be compared the way you compare other things and comparing a strange culture to your own (which is a lot of what 'multiculturalism-discussions' do) the strange one will almost always come out oversimplified and exaggerated (because you notice the differences more than the things you have in common) and also as 'worse', because for many humans 'different' (or 'other, as feminism has it) is always worse than 'normal' or 'mine'.

&gt;As for culture - you can find many definitions of it! 

I'm curios about how those who oppose it tend to define it.

&gt;It generally encompasses the prevailing: language; art; food and drink; attitudes; social rituals; and philosophies.

But I'm guessing people have no problem with foreign „art; food and drink;” and the most they tend to focus on is „social rituals” and „philosophies”. And even so it's about certain social rituals and philosophies. So I am a little intrigued by why people tend to focus on the umbrella term of „culture”.",0,1349689001,null,0,false,0,c6jatkc,t3_114okk,t1_c6jatkc,t1_c6jap52,null,1430092943,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Besides, being against ""multiculturalism"" is pretty stupid. All countries in the world are made up of people with different political views, with differing tastes in food, music, art and so on. Most if not all have people of different religions or philosophies. People are people essentially, personally I have friends that are born in egypt, Iran and Russia that I have more in common with than my neighbour of 60 even though we were born in the same town, have the same religion and speak the same language. 

Extremism is of course a problem, but this problem exist in all religions, philosophies and political views. The fact that its so strong in Islam today has its very clear recent historical reasons and isn't really something that can be attributed islam as a religion. Any religion and religious text can be interpreted by the individual as he or she pleases. Whats more important are the core values of modern society: freedom of speech, freedom of religion/philosophy, equality, justice and respect for other humans. As long as everyone agree and adhere to this the surface details of culture (food, language, rituals etc) are not very important. 

Immigration and emmigration are almost like the weather, you can complain or be happy, but it will happen regardless. People will always want to move from poorer and less successfull regions  to richer ones with a higher standard of living. 

The only real ""monoculture"" that exists right now is North Korea, and that seems to be working out swell for them. 

It seems that a lot of people are blaming the current economic situation in Europe on immigrants, but the notion is completely ridiculous. Our current problems stem from an economic bubble created by poor state politics and irresponsible banks and companies going for easy profits by cheating the system.

&gt;So what parts of American culture have been changed and how?

For one America stopped defining itself as Anglo-Saxon Protestant and now defines itself as Judeo-Christian (thanks also to the Jews). It might not seem as much but redefining a country's identity like that is no small thing. Catholics (subject to the whims of the pope) and Jews were seen as anathema to what a healthy Protestant America should be.

Au risque de se noyer, quelques oiseaux passereux s’ébrouaient violemment dans la purée boueuse, à la frange glauque du fleuve. Au loin, un petit chien sauvage égaré dans les herbes grillées de soleil hurlait, la gorge sèche, la plainte infinie des agonies brûlantes.Au beau milieu du fleuve, totalement irréfutables, deux énormes hippopotames ne laissaient paraître aux regards que les masses immobiles de leurs dos gris jaunâtre au cuir craquelé de boues éparses et d’algues mortes. Seuls, paisibles, au milieu de toute cette faune abrutie de torpeur torride, les deux balourds faisaient des bulles.
Mais qu’on ne s’y trompe pas. L’hippopotame n’est pas qu’un tas de lard essoufflé. L’hippopotame pense. L’hippopotame est intelligent.

Ses immenses naseaux sans fond se mirent à frémir et à recracher des trombes d’eau dans un éternuement obscène et fracassant. Puis il se mit à bâiller. C’était un bâillement cérémonial, lent et majestueux, qui lui déchira la gueule en deux, aux limites de l’éclatement, en même temps qu’étincelait l’ivoire blanc de sa bouche béante et que montait aux nues son beuglement sauvage. Presque aussitôt, le second hippopotame, à son tour, sortit sa tête de l’eau en s’ébrouant frénétiquement. Puis les deux mastodontes se regardèrent longuement, à travers leurs longs cils nacrés.Alors après avoir humé prudemment de gauche et de droite l’air saturé de chaleur électrique, le premier hippopotame dit à l’autre :

Thinking that changing someone's culture so they adopt the culture of the European country they're staying in will lift them out of poverty and reduce crime is not true. If that were true, African-Americans would have the lowest rates of crime and poverty among all ethnic minority groups in the US because they have no African culture and were forcibly assimilated (they were even given English names). Also a lot of the 'gang culture' which exists among some immigrant groups isn't a cultural export from their parents' homeland, it is a response to urban-poverty. Their culture involves rap music, fast cars, hostility to police etc. basically the same as (western) American hip-hop culture - not African culture.

I think heavily focusing on the culture aspect gives politicians an easy way out of completely ignoring the economic and social issues in their own country and pretending it's a foreign problem.

A good system is impossible to find - exactly. They are all very flawed. Morals are a contentious subject and inherently subjective. For example, while you may believe that it is immoral to pass laws on people without their consent, I do not.

However, some governance is more efficient than no governance. The idea behind democracy is that it allows the good will of the people to permeate through to their government and their interactions (as a country) with the rest of the world -- and it roughly achieves that. Electing in representatives who then act somewhat independently is more efficient than direct democracy, and less prone to having an uninformed public make poor, short-sighted, emotional or otherwise poor decisions.

The downside of this method is that it lack stability, which causes planning difficulties and implies losses. Take for example the way that NASA pursued two parallel projects in early 2008, each costing ~$200m, knowing that one would be ditched depending on who got elected and how they funded the agency. In a system without elections (e.g. the top-level of Chinese government), this instability is reduced which gives cost savings. The disadvantage is that it becomes harder for the good will of the people to permeate up to those who govern them.

Multiculturalism is a fairly new ideology superseding the older ""melting pot"" ideology that was a succesful model for example for the US, Australia etc. in the 19th century and first decades of the 20th. The older, ""melting pot"" ideology said immigrants must get rid of their culture and melt into the mainstream culture, while, of course, also changing the mainstream culture a bit. It resulted in people like Al Pacino - almost perfectly standard American with a little bit of Italian ""flavor"".

The new ideology, multiculturalism said, that such melting is not necessary, communities could live side by side, without merging or melting into one, instead keeping their own culture and customs and generally differences. No longer was pressure put to people to melt in.

Example: in the 19th century  a typical German immigrant to the US typically changed his name to an English one. Nowadays a typical Turkish immigrant to Germany does not change his name to a German one, even the idea sounds kind of ridiculous today. And this is precisely the problem, because it symbolizes that within the new multicultural framework the symbolic loyalties and emotions of forging diverse people into nations does not work. 

In other words, the new framework demands that the new migrants should be treated exactly like the old national minorities. But it doesn't make sense - it was always known keeping minority culture hinders nation-building, old national minorities are respected and their differences supported largely because people can't help living in a land one country conquered from another.  Old national minorities are respected because they live in a land that historically belonged to another country.

Disagreeing with the teacher is fine, as long as you do so respectfully and in an appropriate context. 

Also, class participation and group discussions are a daily part of educational practice, here. The role of having group discussions only grows as students age. 

With regards to ""having never see a nationalist teacher"" - I have. Plenty, even. Now, I work in an education-related field and frequently discuss the use of educational material with classroom professionals, so it's possible I am simply exposed to more teachers than you, but still.

So the Irish state was on the hook for all the insane property development loans that went on during the boom years. This single, disastrous meeting is the reason Ireland is fucked.

Just look at the gypsy issue for instance, people often say either 'the societies where they are a large part of as a minority aren't tolerant enough and just blindly hating them' (this is usually people that have had little encounters with them), or it's something like 'gysies are simply the scum of the earth; what a horrible culture; you don't really understand etc.' But to me it's a whole host of mixed factors that determine how people of a certain ethnic origin will turn out, and also how they will be perceived, it's a complex issue that hasn't had enough in-depth research nor has it ever been given a good enough discussion on reddit. It's either someone complaining about them because they have them as neighbours and they don't like them, therefore fuck everyone else of that origin too; or it's someone that has no clue about it but is keen on promoting tolerance even in the face of intolerance.

Ever since we had to be bailed out and forced Europe to pay for our mess everyday on TV - and I mean EVERY single day without any exaggeration - I watch Merkel and Schäuble pointing fingers at Greece and demand further cuts and austerity on every major TV channel.

The news on all the major private channels portray Merkel and Schäuble and the representatives of troika as the bad guys that demand deeper cuts, more austerity and more structural reforms. We constantly watch videos of them talking about Greece. More so than we watch videos of our own goverment and PM sometimes. They are bad mouthed for taking too little action too late, as if we played no part at this. The more they do to help us, the more self-evident they say it was that we need more help but it's still on the wrong direction (read: deep austerity). It's easy to point fingers and blame the powerful Germans that they are making money out of this and not helping us but bringing us to bigger mess.

Our government on the other hand, no matter if it's the current coalition government or the former ones, are portrayed as the last defence that is forced to take the money from us and introduce new taxes but will strive for a bargain to hurt us as little as possible. They are the last defence before the total chaos and collapse of bankruptcy and being kicked out of the EU and Eurozone, something that is being stressed by everyone including for instance the current PM in [Handelsblatt](http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/international/antonis-samaras-die-griechische-demokratie-steht-vor-ihrer-groessten-herausforderung/7217474.html). 

So basically there are two fronts (the good and bad guys) and we realize that something needs to be done (so we cut the good guys some slack). Naturally all that's left to do is blame the bad guys and keep doing that every day. Hence blame Merkel and co. She is the face of 'austerity' that brings more recession and in turn more austerity in a vicious cycle.

2000 units per month plus 500MB of highspeed UMTS traffic (afterwards GPRS speed, but no extra cost, so data flatrate as well), either minutes to every domestic mobile or landline network or sms (yes, you can mix. so there can use 1500 units to talk and still have 500 units for sms left. catch my drift?). this option if valid for a month and will be rebooked if you have sufficient credit left.

If 2000 units are too much for you, check http://www.lidl.de/de/Smart-Tarif. Similar offer, 9,95€, 400 units, 300MB.

If you leave, you can just ditch the SIM...

Both are MVNOs on E-Plus network. Good coverage in cities, sometimes bad receptions in rural areas.

If you need a micro-SIM, you should just visit one of those sketchy looking local phone stores operated by Vietnamese, Turkish or Lebanse fellows. Why? They'll most likely have a stapler to cut your normal size SIM to micro format for a small fee.

&gt;[...] **right now** Greece and Italy are austere enough to manage their expenses [...]

where the emphasis is on *right now*, compared to before the crisis, when Italy, Greece (and many other countries) ran severe primary deficits. This is an important distinction, because according to a number of people (mainly on the left, but not exclusively), the austerity measures were unnecessary. While I'm not sure if the austerity measures are/were wise, they certainly had the intended effect: reducing the primary deficit.

The second point is that, even now that the primary budget is positive (assuming for a moment that this data is correct, and not manipulated again), the debt itself doesn't, and cannot, automatically vanish. After all, the debt was *used* for something (infrastructure, higher wages, as a result: higher standard of living). 

I'm mentioning the last point because OP's title is somewhat disingenious: it's not as if once a country doesn't add *new* debt, the *old* debt somehow magical becomes obsolete and forgotten. 

Note please: for purely practical reasons, I am in favor of reducing Greece's overall debt load further. But that's because otherwise, their economy won't recover for decades to come.

true,AshaVahishta,null,null,"Your point about oil fields almost makes a valid point. *Creating* value is different from *finding* value. Digging for gold contributes little to society, since gold in itself is pretty worthless. Oil, on the other hand, has a very high value in modern society: It is a huge catalyst for trade, and every single person is directly and indirectly dependent on it. So, getting the oil out of the ground and ready for use contributes massively to society. You could argue that oil and other natural resources is a common good, but the work done by the people extracting it is still very valuable to society (and a deal is usually struck between the state and the extracters that in return for getting this out of the ground and into our cars, you will be rewarded with X). Likewise, the first person to make solar energy or thorium reactors commercially viable in such a way that it's cheaper than current energy sources will have contributes immensely to society and deserves to reap the rewards from that.

The fact is that in a modern society such as France, the money for these public goods and the common man's wages has to come from somewhere. And that somewhere is the corporations that pay taxes and wages (and income tax on those wages). These corporations were created by people, who usually become rich in the process. It also doesn't matter whether someone's wealth came from hard work or if they inherited it or got paid as a CEO or manager, ultimately this wealth is the result of *creating value*, and that is precisely what a society needs.

When people dismiss ""multiculturalism"" as a whole they are commiting the same error. Discussing individual problems with for instance political groups or religions is fine, but lumping people together and saying that a whole culture is incompatible with a whole other culture is just a gross and silly simplification of human beings and society. 

There are certainly people within my own culture that I don't get along with, and there are people from outside cultures that I don't get along with, but I try to refrain from generalizing and projecting bad characteristic of smaller groups or single persons on whole populations.

There is no such thing as a homogunous population. We just deal with it and resolve conflicts wherever viewpoints are incompatible.

I'd argue that even the melting pot model wasn't that straight forward. German-American immigrants were actually forced by circumstance to so thoroughly melt into the mainstream American population only because of the 2 world wars. Before that they were pretty distinct. Also there are minorities in america that are anything but assimilated. The Amish, Ultra-Orthodox Jews.

Anyway, this begs the question *what exactly does an immigrant have to leave behind and what he can keep (and why)*. Renouncing some parts of one's identity is not a trivial thing, so one must have a good reason to do so.

As far as I'm concerned names are the least of the problem (since you mentioned it). And by extention, we have to define *what kind of nation are we building that can include immigrants*. We can agree that the old European style nation is hardly fit to make the transition from a monoracial to a multiratial type nation (with the exception of maybe France and the UK). I'd say the shift of focus from ethnicity to culture is the main attempt to redefine european identity, but this process carries a lot of anxiety for the „old European”.

And since you brought up national minorities, even there the process is not that simple. Actually not everybody agrees that national minorities have the right to keep their old culture in total.

Sorry, but that's a glib answer to an existing (and obviously unpleasant) issue. Ignoring it or pretending it's a statistical fluke won't make it go away, and doing so will rather increase the already widespread response by the latently xenophobic part of society that it's a ""taboo topic"", and that the ""liberal/left elite"" doesn't allow discussions about it. I'm in favor of acknowledging it (as far as it is true), and then honestly identifying and addressing the causes for it. Most of which are, I would suspect, related to the economical situation and the education level of immigrants or descendants of immigrants. 

Re: what can be done about the WP article... I don't think you can get consensus that the article is an ""indiscriminate collection of information"", it is after all a research topic by itself. What I *do* think is that the article is heavily biased, and poorly written, both in style and substance. I'm not knowledgeable enought about the field to really get into editing it myself, but I recall that there are places where you can ask for assistance, so that other editors can get involved. I'll see if I can find it again.

    Quel que soit le souci que ta jeunesse endure,
    Laisse-la s'élargir, cette sainte blessure
    Que les séraphins noirs t'ont faite au fond du cœur;
    Rien ne nous rend si grands qu'une grande douleur.
    Mais, pour en être atteint, ne crois pas, ô poète,
    Que ta voix ici-bas doive rester muette.
    
    Les plus désespérés sont les chants les plus beaux,
    Et j'en sais d'immortels qui sont de purs sanglots.
    Lorsque le pélican, lassé d'un long voyage,
    Dans les brouillards du soir retourne à ses roseaux,

    Déjà, croyant saisir et partager leur proie,
    Ils courent à leur père avec des cris de joie
    En secouant leurs becs sur leurs goitres hideux.
    Lui, gagnant à pas lent une roche élevée,
    De son aile pendante abritant sa couvée,
    Pêcheur mélancolique, il regarde les cieux.
    Le sang coule à longs flots de sa poitrine ouverte;
    En vain il a des mers fouillé la profondeur;
    L'océan était vide et la plage déserte;
    Pour toute nourriture il apporte son cœur.
    Sombre et silencieux, étendu sur la pierre,
    Partageant à ses fils ses entrailles de père,
    Dans son amour sublime il berce sa douleur;
    Et, regardant couler sa sanglante mamelle,
    Sur son festin de mort il s'affaisse et chancelle,
    Ivre de volupté, de tendresse et d'horreur.
    Mais parfois, au milieu du divin sacrifice,
    Fatigué de mourir dans un trop long supplice,
    Il craint que ses enfants ne le laissent vivant;
    Alors il se soulève, ouvre son aile au vent,
    Et, se frappant le cœur avec un cri sauvage,
    Il pousse dans la nuit un si funèbre adieu,

First of all, Greece has very little or no structural deficit. It varies from -1% to +1% of GDP, depending on who is measuring it. The budget deficit goes to paying the interest for the debts. The interest alone is currently around 6-7% of GDP 

They borrow money to be able to pay for the interest of older debts. This is not surprising, as at one time last year, the interest rate was around 30%. Even mighty Germany would get into trouble in a couple of years if it had to finance its debt with that interest rate.

The Greek state doesn't buy any oil or food. That's what individual Greek companies do, what has it to do with Greece's credit ratings?

Also, you may find it surprising, but Greece has a rather developed pharma sector, so they won't run of insuline or aspirin.

Well, do not take it then. I don't take a loan and then complain to the bank, then I do not take the loan in the first place. It is about accepting responsibility and consequences for ones action.

&gt;You're putting the blame squarely on one country, which is a very comfortable &amp; easy thing to do when the alternative is looking at europe in general.

How do you mean? I honestly can't think how Europe, in general, caused, the tax evasion in Greece, the low productivity compared to the high salary and the massive corruption, and the low efficiency.  How is that Estonias fault? Switzerland? Russia? Norway? 


The Euro was poorly designed from the beginning, that is certainly not Greece's fault, which is also making it harder for countries to recover. That is one of the reasons I think Greece should leave, not because they are horrible, but because I really can't see another way but Euro A or B, since the countries economies are too different. 

That said,  no one forced Greece to take the loans, to cheat their way in, and to raise the salaries, while the productivity wasn't raised. Nor is anyone else but the Greeks responsible for the tax evasion that is so massive that it is hurting the country, certainly not Germany.

Ireland's issue was the housing bubble and the financial mess that followed it, not a structural problem.

&gt;Portugal is man (country?) enough to look at their own mistakes and issues and try to fix them

It's proving quite difficult to fix them. Popular opinion is worsening and I personally find it awful that out of the five big parties, the communists and the left bloc restless continue to use this to further their anti-EU and anti-free market agenda, the socialists suffer from amnesia considering they were the ones that got us in this mess and the social democrats and the centre-right that are now both in power in a coalition are going the easy short-term way of clearing public debt which is by raising taxes.

So yeah, we're cutting a lot of wasteful spending that we had but I still don't know if I'll be able to find a job here when I finish university because the taxes are unbearable and it's like we're inviting people to leave the country and telling them it would just be easier if they emigrated.

&gt;spain isn't as fucked as any of the other countries down there (yet?)

Spain is in a similar situation that we're in, their structural problems aren't as serious but they're much more fractured and with the separatist movements they have, it can prove a greater challenge.

&gt;same goes for italy

Yup, Italy is like Ireland, they're pretty much in the clear.

So this story begins with the EU, the European Central Bank and the common and Free market in the EU. All of a sudden, corrupt politicians and bankers in south Europe have access to a vast amount of German and French money with very low interest. Bad mix.

In the case of Spain, this resulted in a terrible housing bubble. ""House prices never sink!"" and ""Buy a house with a loan, you'll make money out of it!"" became mantras everywhere. Banks lent money until they run out of money. They kept on lending money... buy borrowing money from European banks. 

Now the bubble did burst, the Spanish banks can't return all this money to the German (and other European) banks. Because well, it doesn't exist. And oh boy they want their money back. The banks lobby Germany and other countries governments to push this ""rescue"" measures to ""stabilize"" the finance market and make sure they get ""their"" money back. 

But, to get this rescue, the country has to control its deficit, to make sure the EU will get the money back. And the local governments (Spanish, Italian, Greece) forces cuts in critical areas, like health or education, civil servant salaries, etc. The governments could also fight the raging corruption -- just kidding, that would be fighting *themselves*. So they blame Europe -- and indirectly, the German.

Add to the mix unhealthy quantities of manipulation and demagogy in the mass media of both ""sides"", North and South Europe, et voilà, hate is born. 

And this is the sad true. Bankers and big corps getting filthy rich, sucking massive interests out of nations, ruining them, stomping on civil rights and well-being. People hating on each other, being divided and conquered by the European elite.

The gang culture you see among 'immigrant youth' for example in French banlieues is the product of exactly the same environment, poor, western ghettos. The hip-hop, rap, gangster culture which the youth exhibit in these areas doesn't come from Algeria or the Ivory Coast, rather it comes from the West.

The Norwegian rape statistics have previously been debunked on here as they only included a specific type of rape, notably that carried out by strangers (note the vast majority of rapes are carried out by someone well-known to the victim) and even though immigrants were over-represented in this, native Norwegians were still a majority.

Regarding your claim it is only poor Muslims who commit crime whereas other immigrant groups don't, this is false:

&gt;In England and Wales, for example, Afro-Caribbeans and migrants 
from the Indian subcontinent began to arrive in large numbers at about the  same time-the  1950s  and  1960s-and experienced comparable forms  and  levels  of  invidious  discrimination. In  the  1990s,  Bangladeshis in particular are on average poorer and more disadvantaged than Afro-Caribbeans. Yet  Afro-Caribbeans in  England 
are as disproportionately involved  in  crime  and  the justice  system compared  with whites, as are blacks in the United  States compared with whites. Indians,  Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis in  England, however,  are less  involved in  crime and the justice system than are whites. (It is possible that crime rates for some Asian groups will rise. Bangladeshis arrived in England later than other groups and are on average younger and poorer. One might also hypothesize that anti-Muslim feelings are rising in England and that this will produce greater 
alienation and higher crime rates. No evidence to sustain either 
theory has as yet  been  reported).

&gt;Similarly, Moroccans and Turks  came to the Netherlands  as guest workers in the 1950s and 1960s. Many stayed and were later 
joined by family members after the  doors  closed to  new  labor migrants in the early 1970s. By the 1990s, both groups were comparably disadvantaged economically and socially compared with the majority population, but crime  and incarceration rates for Turks were  not  much higher than those of the Dutch, while those for Moroccans were much higher.

And yes, recieving less money and having to pay more money is pretty much the same thing: you can argue ""I am not punishing you, I was doing you a favour before"", in people's mind (which is the only thing important, we are talking about how people can disrupt the economy if they think the situation is unfair) it is exactly the same.

&gt;If they can't do anything and have to accept it the progressive tax system will work. If they can move to a different country it will fail.

Here is your catch 22: if a socialist government does not rise taxes higher for the rich, you have strikes and global social unrest. If they do, some rich leave the country.

&gt;What did smart Jewish people do when anti-semitic rhetoric was heating up in Germany? What did they do when the Nurenburg laws were passed? They got the hell out. That's what the rich are doing in France right now.

Are you serious?

&gt;Why should they respond to threats of violence? In five years those making the threats will be saying that 75% isn't enough and that they now need 90%. Why wait?

Violence? When I say ""buying social peace"" I mean that having your workers on strike or unable to go to work because the transports are on strike sucks when you want to run a business. Nobody is threatening anyone (well, I'm sure some people do, but you get what i mean).

&gt; The rich are specifically vilified and targeted.

By the far left? Certainly.  
By the government? How is the official discourse ""you are our wealthiest citizens, the one who would suffer the least from higher taxes, so you will be the backbone of our budget for the two years to come. We trust you to be patriotic enough not to dodge the tax"" vilifying?

Why are you always placing yourself as a taxed rich? The question is not what the rich should do, but what the government should. And yes, the government cares about disrupted economics.  
So do the rich for that matter: as i wrote above they have made their fortune in France, with French assets and based on the French economy. If you make your money by owning a supermarket company operating in France, you can try to relocate to Singapore, but it will be risky and lengthy.

&gt;And the government will be facing it without having rich people to tax if it drives them out. If rich people leave, they take their money while France is left with the politicians, unions, and debt.

Not all of them will leave, because (in that order) 1. they want to stay home 2. their assets are not that liquid 3. they actually want to help 4. other reasons.

So the rich should leave the US because Occupy Wall Street does not like them and Obama wants to remove tax cuts? You will be tempted to say say it is FAR worse in France but no, compared to the two other examples above, it is exactly the same thing.

People that are around people that are like them are more altruistic, happier, vote more, and are more involved in the community.

How is it prevented in practically every European country? Constitution should set ground rules, but laws are there too. Prevent the arrest. It seems like the US cops have a thing for arresting people, since your incarceration rate is the highest in the developed world (by far). I am not a politician, lawyer, or a man of the legislature, and I don't know how the rules should be written, but it's not like you'd be the first. 

We have protest all the time. Citizens gather, they walk on the street, cause the traffic to ground to a halt. But they're protesting against a government decision. Of course, the government could order to arrest all of them. It can line them up and shoot them. But it's not what they do. 

&gt; Also, public university does not mean that members of the public have access to all its facilities in any way they please. It just means that it is funded in part by the relevant state's legislature, as opposed to private universities, which get all their money from tuition and wealthy donors.

Do you have any evidence to show that it *was* unsustainable? Any economies around the world that you'd like to point to? Because the way I see it, in fiat money systems well-spent government debt is just the government overcoming its people's desire to save and then going on to fully employ the nation. The Japanese, with high propensity to save, necessitates a government with high debt. USA, with high foreign demand for its dollar and a deleveraging, saving, private sector - likewise, needs a government with high debt.

I really don't see anything complicated/scary about this, it's just the way it is - in this largely zero-sum money system, for one entity to save, another must be in debt. I don't look at Japan (230% GDP in debt) and go ""that's unsustainable"", nor do I look at the USA (100%) and think that, nor Singapore (100%), nor the UK (83%) - I just see it as government's doing what they ought to do, issue enough debt that the private sector is content with its savings in that currency, and onwards such that high employment is reached.

Greece the problem is the same as those nations, but it has no solution available to it. There's minimal credit worthy customers appearing on bank's doors asking for a loan. There's a lot of people trying to save, knowing times are going to get worse. Unlike conventional monetary systems, the government cannot run a debt to satiate this desire. Households continue to put aside what they can, taking from one another, mass unemployment is inevitable. Their hands have been well and truly tied behind their backs by the EMU, and as a result we see what we have before us. I see no manner in which this could have happened under the drachma.

Granted, under the drachma it's probable that Greece would not have had a high exchange rate. Exchange rates depend entirely on demand for foreign holdings in the drachma, foreign investment, and for Greek exports. But, and with no offense intended to the Greeks, their current Euro exchange rate is far in excess of what it should actually be if Greece were to be rated on its own merits. So whilst I can see why they may like to be able to join a currency propped up by the likes of Germany - should fully employing their own nation not be a higher priority than cheaper imports and fewer exports?",0,1349775404,null,0,1349780402,0,c6jt71b,t3_115tqe,t1_c6jt71b,t1_c6jt01h,null,1430101733,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

It'd have the same impact on inflation, a lesser impact on the exchange rate, and you get to keep the road.

I'm arguing for the government to ensure full employment. ChemicalPleasure is warning that would mean a lower exchange rate - I'm saying so what? Is full employment not a more important goal?

A simple [job guarantee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_guarantee) system, paid for by a government with a free floating drachma, would instantly end unemployment and quickly maximise the size of the private sector. The level of the guaranteed wage sets inflation caused by the system and the size of the job guarantee sector relative to the private and public sectors. It's a largely self-regulating system, as the private/public sectors back off in their hiring - more money is injected - as the private sector picks up again it automatically backs off.

Right, except your law bans being at one place for an extended period of time, camping on public grounds, blocking traffic, yelling too loud, public disorder... all that bullshit which effectively does prevent protesting.

At least when there is a general order to bun public gatherings you know you shouldn't go there. This way, in the US, you go there, and then you get arrested for **not breaking the law**. Which brings me to your point

&gt; No, my point that the public can't go wherever it pleases whenever it pleases in a public university is very relevant to the issue of trespassing.

Right, but this was, like I said, during class time. How were the police to differentiate who was protesting and who was going to class? Looks like they couldn't, so they arrested everyone just to be certain. Or was no one allowed to be inside the building at the time (this was like at noon on Wednesday, the building is open, the classes are taking place) which would mean there's a general order to ban public gatherings, only you're told that on your way to the police station. Or are you telling me that I'm trespassing if I am going to my class like a good student that I am?

Another example that I remember is 800 high school graduates being kicked out of a hotel in downtown Minneapolis for causing troubles. Now, of course, only a few of them were causing problems, but they were all kicked out. No problem. The problem is that within minutes a total of more than 40 police cars appeared on the spot, with automatic rifles and all. I was there, saw it with my own eyes. I thought the US was going to war or something. Naturally, hundreds were arrested, even though still only a few were really breaking the law hardcore.

&gt; That is because of the War on Drugs, which is a separate issue.

That may be, but I will say one thing. I've lived in the US for 4 years. I've also lived in Serbia for 20 years and in Austria for 2. 

While in the US I have witnessed an arrest a total of 7 times. And I don't hang out with bad people, I don't do drugs, or anything like that. On the other hand, while in Serbia, I have witnessed an arrest once, when I was 10. In Austria I've never seen an arrest.

I'm not an expert in macroeconomics, so I can only give you a political context: In the past 18 years we had 3 populist right-wing governments led by Berlusconi (1994, 2001-2006, 2008-2011, with Tremonti in the role of finance minister) that kept promising tax cuts and richness, and two left-wing governments whose major refrain was ""we need to fix italian economy"". Since 2001 Berlusconi had a strong majority in the parliament, while the left wing governments where weaker, unstable and unpopular, yet the latter managed to perform better economy-wise, (the increase in primary balance in the 2006-2008 Prodi government was achieved by fighting tax evasion, the public debt also started to grow again under Berlusconi and went down under Prodi).  
We entered the 2008 economic crisis with the worst possible government: an over 70 years old Berlusconi that already proved is lack of interest in taking unpopular measures to fix Italy's finances, now dealing with endless sex scandals and trials.  
Everything went to shit, Berlusconi resigned, and now Monti is taking again the hard task of fixing the economy.  
The major differences between him and Prodi are that Monti has a stronger majority in the parliament and that he's a moderate right's economist with a right wing parliamentary majority, so while he finally has all the power needed for the task, his policies are hitting the lower and middle class and the labour market much harder than they probably should.

Enough money that householders are content with their savings (due to the higher purchasing power) and they can again think about spending, restoring the private sector.

We've pulled out of recessions this way in the past under similarly money/revenue constrained systems such as the gold standard. After austerity and a bit of deflation, eventually you can grow.

The thing is though - under a government controlled fiat money system there's no need to ever impose a deflationary period on your people. There's no need for the mass unemployment. The money supply is under the government's control - it can be increased and decreased at will, any level of savings by the people can be met and then exceeded to create full employment - and similarly, any excess in the money supply can be quickly removed, preventing hyperinflation (inflation targeting central banks perform this task admirably).

The problem with the Euro is it removes this power from governments completely. It assumes that central bank setting monetary policy alone is sufficient to ensure stable economies. It isn't. If the Eurozone has taught us anything, it's that.

Interest rates as stimulus are problematic in two main ways: one, they're a really ham-fisted approach. One applicable for Germany would likely be wildly inappropriate for Greece. The other is that once they're already at or near zero percent interest, reserve banks are more or less powerless at creating demand in the economy (see the USA/UK/Japan).

What other accounts? If it's in Switzerland it's taxed. If it's not in Switzerland then it's not under Swiss jurisdiction. According to the Swiss government only 1% of all the German assets in Switzerland have been moved out since September 2011.
Of that 1%, 50% went to Germany, 25% to other EU nations and only 25% is outside of the EU.

Democracy would be served by the decrease in coruption and the increase in faith in the government might help convince people to pay their taxes. This would, in my vision, be the way forward.

* It leaves the Eurozone and re-adopts the drachma in which case exchange rates plummet causing unemployment to soar and imported goods to become scarce. Eventually Greece would get back on its feet and most likely muddle on like before using the money press as an alternative to production and growth. Politicians would promise people secure jobs in return for votes etc. etc. but after a while the devaluation of the drachma is so severe that import becomes crippled and the next recession occurs.

There are [influential people](http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2011/03/22/soros-backs-main-policies-modest-proposal/) siding with such solutions.

&gt; **Policy 1: Ending the disintegration of the Eurozone’s banking system**

&gt; For a while now, the expected value of a euro in a bank account in Madrid or Rome has been lower than that of a euro in a German or Dutch bank account. This is so because stricken banks in Spain and Italy must rely for capital injections from the respective states which find their own re-financing unsustainable. The capital flight that follows pushes these banks and the states that are supposed to stand behind them into a death spiral that is only made worse by the combination of austerity and loans from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). To break the deadly embrace between insolvent member-states and bankrupt banks, the task of recapitalising Europe’s banks must be shifted directly to the EFSF, under the supervision of the ECB. Such a Euro-TARP can be created immediately and with no Treaty changes whatsoever.

&gt; **Policy 2: Dealing with the Debt Crisis**

&gt; The ECB could announce tomorrow morning that, henceforth, it will be undertaking a Debt Conversion Program for any member-state that wishes to participate: It will service (as opposed to purchase) a portion of every maturing government bond corresponding to the percentage of the member-state’s public debt that is allowed by the Maastricht Treaty.[3]

&gt; To fund these redemptions on behalf of some member-state, the ECB will issue bonds in its own name, guaranteed solely by the ECB but repaid, in full, by the member-state: Upon the issue of ECB bonds, the ECB will simultaneously open a debit account per participating member-state into which the latter is legally bound to make deposits to cover the ECB-bonds’ coupons and principal. These debts of member-states to the ECB shall enjoy super-seniority status and be insured by the EFSF against the risk of a hard default.

&gt; This Debt Conversion Program, which involves no debt monetisation, will instantly engender large interest rate reductions for fiscally-stricken states without any concomitant rise in the long term interest rates that Germany pays (since Germany is not guaranteeing the Program).

&gt; **Policy 3: Redressing low aggregate investment and internal imbalances**

&gt; Having allowed this Crisis to fester for so long, the Eurozone fell unnecessarily into a fresh recession which exacerbates its internal imbalances. Europe is now in urgent need of its own New Deal; i.e. a policy for shifting the mountains of idle savings into profitable investments, especially in the deficit regions.

&gt; Remarkably, Europe can achieve this without Keynesian stimuli. The European Investment Bank (EIB) has a sterling record in financing, through its own bond issues, profitable investments and has a long list of shovel-ready potentially lucrative projects that could realise Europe’s New Deal. What we need is that the EIB’s hands are untied by allowing for the national contribution to projects (currently set, by convention, to 50% of total funding) to be funded by a net-issue of either ECB-bonds or of bonds by the EIB’s sister organisation, the European Investment Fund (EIF).

&gt; **Neither Treaty changes nor unanimity are necessary**

&gt; Three crises, three policies for addressing them, each involving existing institutions and requiring no Treaty changes, no German guarantees of other nations’ debts, no Keynesian stimuli, no Central Bank monetisation.

&gt; Alas, Europe, deeper in self-doubt than in debt, is dithering while the Eurozone crumbles. Many blame the requirement of unanimity for this. Only it is not true: unanimity is unnecessary! Nine member-states or more can call for these policies to apply to them on the established (but never used) principle of ‘enhanced cooperation’ and ‘qualified majority voting’. (Click here for our letter to the Financial Times on this issue.)

&gt; The institutions are in place and the solution is within reach. All that is missing is the will.

E.g. in the case of Italian and Spanish debt-toGDP ratios tthat are in the region of 120% and 90% respectively, then the ECB would be servicing 50% of each Italian government maturing bond and 66.7% of each Spanish government maturing bond.",0,1349783327,null,0,false,0,c6jtwcb,t3_116uuf,t1_c6jtwcb,t1_c6jtuuh,null,1430102143,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

The big problem is also caused by biased media coverage that portrays the troika as evil dictators that are responsible for our misfortunes. Even if we were offered a bad deal, it is the goverment's responsibility to refuse / provide alternatives or at least negotiate to make things better.

As I understand it, the only policies that would actually end the crisis within 10 years are:

* Higher eurozone inflation, which will allow Greece (and Spain!) to acheive internal devaluation to restore competitiveness faster.

* Large, permanent transfers from the core to the periphery to keep things stable.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; It leaves the Eurozone and re-adopts the drachma in which case exchange rates plummet causing unemployment to soar and imported goods to become scarce.

Which in turn boosts their export sector, eventually finding an equilibrium point.

In any case, a low exchange rate needn't cause unemployment at home. I see no reason to believe there's an underlying law to the universe that states that even when an entire country wants to work that sometimes unemployment is required, as is the case with the only two solutions you see. Unemployment to me appears a failing for us to properly understand economics and money, nothing more. If people *want* to work how on Earth can it be that the answer sometimes is only ""you can't, not til your nation's gone through austerity""?

Your approach is ""the only way out is via unemployment, one way or the other"" - are you really sure that's required? That our universe is set up that way?

Because by may way of thinking, a government that is only inflation constrained and not revenue constrained (unlike Greece) ought to have no problem ending unemployment via a [job guarantee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_guarantee) system. Inflationary impact of spending's always going to be minimal as long as it's being spent on cold parts of the economy, it's when you're spending it in manners that don't/can't increase growth that it's a real problem (or worse, on measures that *decrease* growth, a'la Wiemar, Zimbabwe, Hungary). If it's higher than desired simply lower the guaranteed minimum wage, increase taxes or increase interest rates.

The only real consequence is as you have said, that more people having drachmas means more imports being sought after for a fixed level of exports = a lower exchange rate, and a larger export sector yes. That needn't mean unemployment though, and it only happens because previously only those with jobs (which include the export sector) held drachmas - now everyone has jobs, somewhat diluting the export sector down.

Long-term having a generation of people that have always had jobs is going to have to mean a stronger economy than one where 20% of the population have been without for a decade or more - even if the former did have a higher exchange rate through the jobless period.

&gt; Austerity is not a punishment (should not be anyway), it is not one alternative among many; it is simply the base fact that spending more than you have (including growth) will eventually cause crippling debt.

Governments with their own fiat currency have an unlimited ""amount"" of the currency they issue. We know this, it is *they* that permit their own central banks completely unlimited capacity to create money be it via open-market operations or QE.

Now don't get me wrong, this self-imposed restriction on government spending, that their budgets must be met by debt, is a good one. I'd be very nervous without it. But note that the system needn't be set up this way - I'm proposing just one small, simple improvement. That the reserve bank be granted one additional tool, one actually useful when demand for credit is low (as it is in Greece today, or at least by credit-worthy customers). That would be the ability to set the minimum wage in a job guarantee system.

It'd just be one more way money the reserve bank could choose to have money enter the economy, particularly useful when demand for credit is low. And it's a very powerful way - it entirely self regulates its money injection rate (high in recessions, low in booms) - it's very targeted, responding automatically to single towns in recession whilst not hitting booming cities at all, and very flexible. JG sector too large/inflation too high? Simply reduce the guaranteed wage.

That's all I propose - that Greece takes back its drachma, swallows its pride that it's exchange rate that now accurately represents its capacity to export and foreign demand for investment is a lot lower than before, and gives an independent bank the ability to set the wage of a job guarantee system. Through that, I see no reason why Greece need have unemployment.. or any other nation for that matter.",0,1349785708,null,0,1349786173,0,c6ju6ia,t3_115tqe,t1_c6ju6ia,t1_c6jtsai,null,1430102280,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; Higher eurozone inflation, which will allow Greece (and Spain!) to acheive internal devaluation to restore competitiveness faster.

As far as I understand it, that wouldn't change anything but make the whole of Europe less competitive, all while the states in crisis are still not competitive compared to the better-off ones.

&gt; Large, permanent transfers [like in the] USA

Yes, permanent transfers could work if they come with common finance and economic policies -- also similar to how it's in the USA. Just sending more money indefinitely won't work. We tried that until we're in the situation we're in now.

&gt; Greece (and maybe others) leave the Eurozone and devalue. This will make things much worse before it makes them better, but may still work faster than austerity.

I doubt that. If you think austerity and the situation is bad now, you really don't want to see how it would be without the Euro.

Nobody will force you to work 10h or 12h daily. And, tbh, it looks to me as a preferable alternative of not working at all. btw, this would be unnecessary if their productivity was higher.

&gt;heavily raising taxes to the poor majority of people

Fuck this. We have it here in Portugal as well and this is not austerity, it's the opposite of austerity, it's increasing the size of the government and driving people away from the country.

However, we both know that this isn't what they're protesting, this is a left-wing protest, these are the ones that criticize taxes when they're not in the government but have plans of increasing them massively once they get into power (how else would they fund the government spending they so desire?)

&gt;while not seeking taxes from the big companies

My problem here is that they should not seek such high taxes from everyone. Taxing the poor massively drives away the workforce, taxing the rich massively drives away the investors. If they want to keep unemployment down and they want to generate economic growth, they really need to cut back on public spending, it's the only viable alternative, high taxes for anyone is going towards a default.

&gt;bailing out banks that now report huge profits

Bailouts =/= free market. No bailouts and much stricter regulation to prevent banks from gambling with their customers' money is what's fair, not letting them reap their rewards when they do well and having all of society pay for it when they fail. Oh, and why aren't they paying back the bailouts now that they're reporting profits? Aren't they in debt to the state?

&gt;continuing big spending on military

Yeah, I'd cut on that too. Why do you need it anyway? AFAIK Turkey may act nasty but they aren't planning on invading you.

&gt;putting essential public companies in large debt on purpose in order to sell them cheap

That's state-owned companies for you, if they're not owned by privates, they don't have the proper incentives to generate profits. I'd sell them all too, it's not the role of the state to own TV stations, airline companies and telecommunication agencies when the privates can provide the exact same services more cheaply and without an expense to the taxpayers.

It's certainly not the fault of those that loaned the money to you like Germany - you asked for it, you signed the contracts and now you don't want to pay them - it doesn't work like that.

I admit, I'm supposing a rational, decent government with the trust of its people - changing the monetary system requires as much. And I absolutely understand that Greece does not have this - that does not stop me from being extremely frustrated at the austerity measures I see happening over there, and the immense long-lasting harm it will be causing their society and economy. But you're right, given reality - their future is bleaker. Is it the same for all nations currently undergoing austerity though? Are they surely necessary?

ie the UK, cutting deficits whilst the central bank is desperately trying to get more money into the economy, putting their own economy into negative growth entirely through their own choosing. The government's being offered negative real interest rates to fix the economy, yet it's still cutting its deficit. They could give the Bank of England ""off the books"" measures as I outlined before, actually give it a means of stimulating demand, but no.

Now I realise ""with great power comes great responsibility"" applies to fiat more than any other, which is why I push for the guarantee system being as non-political as we can make it. We've come to accept central banks controlling interest rates to regulate unemployment and inflation, but unfortunately when the private sector doesn't want credit - it's powerless to get it to take it on. As such, we require governments to intervene in recessions, a problem for both Euro nations and conservative or hung governments alike. For the over $2tn in QE created by the Fed in the US they could have employed every single unemployed person there for $15k a year, *for over 10 years* - yet despite the QE they still have 8% unemployment and a low participation rate, current monetary systems are that flawed.

Unfortunately, what I push for whilst it could be applied at the ECB level, I imagine would make Germany and co quite unhappy as the demand for imports from those in the JG would be lowering the exchange rate, whilst their jobs would be unlikely to create much in the way of useful exports. Which is why I ask for Greece (and every Euro nation actually) to return to their own currency.

&gt;By the mechanisms you describe Greece could have already helped itself before it even got so deeply embroiled in this crisis, it did not.

Not really. I see what's happening as quite inevitable, it's just the PIGS nations taking the fall for what was ultimately a flawed setup from the get-go. One that assumed that central banks, through QE and OMOs alone, are sufficient to ensure smooth running economies. They're not.

Even if all the PIGS leave tomorrow the next time we run into a global hiccup it'll be the next weakest nations falling the same way. Automatic stabilisers are a powerful thing, when your nation loses its taste for debt - when it wants to save - the government's going to accrue debt. In the EMU that can only mean countries looking at bankruptcy as investors flea for more powerful nations. You cannot flea the sole issuer of a currency however, which is why this problem does not present in such nations, even when you're &gt;200% GDP in debt, ie Japan. The Euro was/is a broken system. This [1992 essay](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/10pwub/a_prophetic_1992_essay_that_foresees_nearly_all/) posted in /r/economics puts how flawed the setup is quite succinctly.

Greek wages must fall relative to German wages in some fashion. I am making a point distinguishing among alternatives. We can do it with low inflation and austerity (result: 10 years of grinding stagnation in Greece, leaving permanent scars in the labor market as high unemployment persists) or we can do it with less austerity and moderate inflation (result: 5 years of grinding stagnation wtih somewhat lower unemployment throughout).

&gt; And why should Germans accept their hard earned savings to evaporate?

German savers were quite happy to accept the benefits when their banks invested in booming Greek, Spanish, and other assets in the lead up to this crisis. If inflation becomes somewhat higher, only the owners of long-term debt will be hurt (which is a real cost to this idea, which must be acknowledged and considered against the benefits).

Parts of the problem that are Germany's or the EU's fault:

* Setting up a single currency area that includes economies too different to work together.

* Pumping vast amounts of money into Greek banks and Greek sovereign debt, causing massive wage inflation in Greece. This involved private action (private banks) and public action (the low risk premium on Greek public debt showed the market believed there was an implicit bailout guarantee, which the EU did not dispel forcefully enough).

* Monetary policy to suit the core but not the periphery (easy money when Germany needed it, tighter-than-needed money when Greece needs easy money).

* Insisting on tax hikes and spending cuts when they will not shorten the crisis and are therefore economically pointless. (Their purpose is moral, not economic, in my opinion.)

Parts of the problem that are Greece's fault:

* Deciding to join the Euro.

* Reacting to the economic boom by immediately spending all the new money on permanent, hard-to-reverse spending promises.

* Reacting to low interest rates by borrowing way more. What they should have done is run a very big fiscal surplus to try to counteract the huge capital inflow. Spain did this to some extent, but not enough. Greece went in the opposite direction.

true,yeropinionman,UNSA,United States,"Most states have a ""balanced budget"" requirement, requiring that revenues match revenues. In any given year they can get around this (""run a deficit"") by playing tricks with accounting rules, spending down reserves, and things like that.

They can also issue long-term debt, with restrictions that vary by state. In Michigan, where I'm from, we can issue debt only with a plan that is first put on a statewide ballot (with an explanation of what the borrowed money can legally be used for) by a vote of the legislature, then approved by the voters directly. This process takes a long time to happen, often over a year. 

This is very different than what we think of as ""budget deficits"" by countries. It's true that states could accumulate too much debt, but it will generally be debt approved by the voters directly through a separate process, and the money can't be just used for general government unless voters approved that too.

Well, here:
&gt;Not shown in the pic: the Greeks which know that difficult choices have to be made and that there's no easy way out of this mess that the massive spending policies got them into

Really, don't you know what every politician in Greece and Europe is proposing to cut? Do you live in another planet? 

&gt;&gt;bailing out banks that now report huge profits

&gt;Bailouts =/= free market. No bailouts and much stricter regulation to prevent banks from gambling with their customers' money is what's fair

Yeah, you are living in a dream world buddy, go back to your economics books, where the capitalistic heaven is described. It's like there aren't two and a half centuries of capitalistic history to draw conclusions and data from. Give me a place and time where capitalism was corruption free and avoided such problems. You won't, because capitalism is all about protecting and promoting the interests of the big companies. Not about ""giving everyone the chance to have a business"". The latter is a necessity and is only allowed in the degree that helps the big ones.

&gt;&gt;continuing big spending on military

&gt;Yeah, I'd cut on that too. Why do you need it anyway? AFAIK Turkey may act nasty but they aren't planning on invading you.

If you really agree with this, why don't you say that the people are right to protest when Merkel wants Greece to buy military equipment from them? Or when German companies want cheap access to over-exploit the greek economy? Because you view protesters as hippies, not as part of people as they are.

&gt;20% tax rate should be enough for everyone

Of course, taxing 2K a pensioner of 10K income, 10K a family of four with a joint income of 50K and 100K someone with income of 500K are all the same. 2K, 10K and 100K have the same importance to all 3 of them. How democratic your claim. Are you sure your opinion serves your interests and those of your people and country? Are you sure this is not giving into the terrorism of EU, IMF and your local big companies?

&gt;&gt;putting essential public companies in large debt on purpose in order to sell them cheap

&gt;That's state-owned companies for you, if they're not owned by privates, they don't have the proper incentives to generate profits

Well, let me inform you that a lot of profitable or barely-debt-creating-but-providing-important-services-cheaply-to-the-masses public companies were given this treatment because they wanted to sell them to the private sector and that was the only way: public train system, public electricity, public water, public telecommunications-this last one was massively profitable! Why did they have to privatize them? Was it for the good of the people?

true,yeropinionman,UNSA,United States,"Yes, but only because the following things are true about the US that are not true of the Euro zone:

* Relatively high labor mobility, as language and cultural barriers are smaller within the US than within Europe.

* Persistent transfers between US states. Many states, like Mississippi permanently receive more than they pay in taxes, while others, like New Jersey, receive less. The productive states subsidize the less productive ones to some extent.

* Much more policy is directed at the federal level than at the state level. Federal spending is [20-22% of GDP, while state and local spending combined is around 13% of GDP](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=bDj). For example, we have a single, unified old-age-pension system paid for by the whole country rather than at the state level, which helps avoid any individual state getting into too much trouble.

* We have a central bank that officially cares somewhat about both inflation and unemployment. The ECB seems to be focused exclusively on inflation. This may lead to persistently high unemployment in some areas.

Even still, we have problems that come from our single currency. I would argue that the economic problems of our industrial [""rust belt""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_belt) states like Indiana and Ohio would be greatly helped if the region (which has about 50 million people, more than Spain) had its own currency that could have been devalued against the currencies of the booming coasts.

&gt;Why did you borrow the money? Why do you have tax evasion? Why do you have low productivity?

The Greek government borrowed money because it could. I'm not saying that it was innocent nor that there is not responsible for the consequences. The people didn't know any better. Tax evasion is a problem but the crisis would have happened even if everyone paid their taxes. Low productivity has historical roots; it is because the economy of Greece is not advanced and it does not have much capital. That, in turn, is because Greece has not been a big political, economic or military power in a long time.

In short, the Euro is wrongly contstructed, from the beginning, but one is responsible for the loans one takes.

This is not really a language quiz, for example, what does Ich bin ein Berliner have to do with languages, or that question about where does the Vienner schnitzel originates from. It's a Vienner schnitzel only in English (and a few other languages), but for example in Hungarian it doesn't contain the word Vienna at all. Why is this in a quiz about languages??

Also, the question about which language has a grammar for love (or something like that) is incorrect. It says the ""correct"" answer is Slovenian, but the way you say ""I love you"" in Slovenian is no different from other languages. They explain then that Slovenian has a dual number, which is true, but what the fuck does that have to do with love? What if two people hate each other, that can also be expressed with duality!

Please don't make me repeat everything I've said so far. Scroll up and re-read the conversation. Hopefully, what I said makes some sense.

&gt; Same goes for my country, (Sweden), Finland, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Ireland, etc.

Perhaps it would be better if I said that not only it wasn't a big (economic, military, political) power but it was also mostly a puppet state. Anyway, I would not put all these countries you mentioned in the same group. Some are into this scheme to protect their economic interests (or the economic interests of entities that they are affiliated with) while the rest (the poorer ones) were bullied/coerced into participating to this crazy scheme by the more powerful ones. 

&gt; I agree with you, but it would cut your primary deficit and you might not have to make the cuts you are currently making, thus making everything better for the population as a whole. 

You may agree personally, but the terms of the bailout are completely divergent with your opinion on this issue. If your country really cared about things like this, then you'd add them to the terms of the bailout package instead of constantly asking for reduced rights and wages for the working class and fire sales of strategic assets.

&gt; No, not really. Greece's interest rates were to low because you were in the Euro. A) You shouldn't have been there B) The Euro is wrongly constructed, to put it mildly. Other countries had low interest rates too, like Finland, but they were dealing with it. 

I guess I agree with the point you're making. Greece could have been more careful and in that case it would not be in the centre of the mess. Still, my point stands: the mess would have been created regardless of how responsible Greece was.

&gt; In short, the Euro is wrongly contstructed, from the beginning, but one is responsible for the loans one takes. 

But the logical conclusion of this kind of thinking is that if one takes a loan one can't pay back, then he deserves to suffer for all his life? Your treatment of the population of Greece is your the creditor countries' moral responsibility and you can't hide behind the moralising tale about how we need to be ""taught a lesson"". 

&gt; It would have been cheaper for everyone but the Greeks to let the Frenc/Germans to save their own banks and to let Greece default. 

At this point, I'm willing to argue that it would have been better to let Greece default for the Greeks too. If it was done in amicable terms (no economic sanctions against Greece etc) then the economy of Greece would have recovered by now. 

&gt; But, that didn't happen, and I really do not see how one can complain about that, in particular since the Greeks themselves want to stay in the Euro, according to polls, and votes.

That's not as black and white as you put it. The only reason that Greeks want to stay in the euro is sentimental; it represents the country rising from third-world status and becoming part of an elite club. An exit from this club has been described as a catastrophic move that will be the harbinger of all evils. It is for these reasons that the votes and the polls have been what they were until now. If the perception of this club changes (which is happening because of the treatment Greece is getting) and the perception of the consequences also changes (which is also happening because people are beginning to believe that it can hardly get any worse than it already is) then the polls and the votes will be different. And we can already see this trend in recent polls. ",0,1349809437,null,0,false,0,c6jzse5,t3_114ohj,t1_c6jzse5,t1_c6jzfie,null,1430104918,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Gro-Tsen,null,null,"&gt; Germany was violently opposed to this, we only agreed because France insisted on it as a condition for the reunification.

""Germany"" and ""France"" do not have a single opinion each (if anything, the highly divided result of the 1992 referendum in France on the Maastricht treaty should make that obvious).  But even if we abide by the synecdoche, I claim that your statements are in error.  Since it appears to be a common myth, perhaps fueled by [an article in the *Spiegel*](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-price-of-unity-was-the-deutsche-mark-sacrificed-for-reunification-a-719940.html) (whose conclusion is, however, justly prudent), and a possibly damaging one as well, I think is is worth pointing out the following in some detail:

* The essential impetus to creating the Single Currency was provided not by France, but by Germany's foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, in his memorandum published (in personal capacity) in February 1988 (during the German presidency of the EC Council), ""Memorandum für die Schaffung eines Europäischen Währungsraumes und einer Europäischen Zentralbank"", in which he argues strongly for the creation of a monetary union and central bank.  (And this is before the fall of the wall, so it couldn't possibly have been written in order to satisfy France's demands concerning reunification.)

* Helmut Kohl openly proclaimed the idea of the ""United States of Europe"" and saw monetary union as a step toward that goal.  (Again, this cannot conceivably be a result of France's influence, and François Mitterrand was *not* a federalist: he always favored the intergovernmental approach.)

* It *is* true that Bundesbank president Karl-Otto Pöhl, who was invited to join the Delors ""Committee for the Study of Economic and Monetary Union"" was initially opposed to the idea.  However, when Jacques Delors made it clear that he would be willing to concede almost anything, Pöhl agreed to participate, on the terms that the European Central Bank should be independent from political control and have price stability as its key objective.  In the end, the Delors report was signed by all participant, including Pöhl (and including the governor of Bank of England, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, much to Thatcher's displeasure).

* I can only emphasize once more: the Delors report was submitted in April 1989, it had strong support by the German government, and nobody at the time could possibly have imagined that German unification would be happening within two years.  (Also, Jacques Delors was acting as president of the EC Commission, not representing France.)

* It is hardly conceivable anyway that France could have prevented German unification, which had strong support by the Bush administration, once it was agreed in principle by Gorbachev.  If anyone tried to prevent reunification, it was Margaret Thatcher, who tried—and failed—to get Mitterrand to side with her; perhaps also Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who had reservations.  But Mitterrand explained to his advisor Jacques Attali that he saw German reunification as inevitable since it was the will of the German people.

* What *is* true is that Mitterrand was upset with Kohl's handling of the question, and specifically the fact that he had not been consulted when Kohl announced his ""ten-point plan"" toward reunification on November 28, 1989.  It is probable that Mitterrand either hoped or expected unification to take place on a longer time scale.

* Kohl, on the other hand, was upset with the insistence by other European governments (including Thatcher and Mitterrand) that he recognize the Oder-Neisse line as the definitive frontier of Germany.  If something was made a condition of reunification, it is this, and it is the crux of the ""four plus two"" treaty of September 1990.

* But both Kohl and Mitterrand, and other European leaders (not including Thatcher), agreed on the fact that German unification should be placed ""in the perspective of European integration"" (words taken from the ""Declaration on Central and Eastern Europe"" in the [conclusions](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/summits/strasbourg/st_en.pdf) of the presidency of the European Council of 8–9 December 1989).  From Mitterrand's perspective, this was mostly about making sure that the French-German duo would remain central in European community and that Germany's commitment would not turn elsewhere: Kohl was keen to reassure him there.  Monetary union was just one aspect of European integration, Delors's baby, not Mitterrand's.

* Even if France *had* had some means to pressure Germany, it would have been more than easy for Germany to turn its back on the monetary union once it had achieved reunification.  Delors's goal was to achieve an economic, not just monetary, union: this goal, obviously, has failed (so far), principally for lack of sufficient German support, just as political union has failed for lack of sufficient French support; monetary union was made possible because France and Germany both agreed to it, as the result of a historical compromise on the role of the ECB.

* To summarize: it *is* true that German reunification was central in accelerating European integration and the Maastricht treaty, but it is very wrong, somewhat silly—and damaging—to suggest that it was used as a means to pressure Germany against its will.",0,1349810364,null,0,false,0,c6k01lr,t3_116uuf,t1_c6k01lr,t1_c6jw240,null,1430105044,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

No, I honestly can not for the life of me understand why Estonia for example have to support Greece, or to be more exact, have done *anything*. Same with Finland, they haven't done anything towards Greece, or any of the countries in the IMF. I honestly do not get why they are to blame, which you said, or even why poorer states have to contribute to Greece.


&gt;Perhaps it would be better if I said that not only it wasn't a big (economic, military, political) power but it was also mostly a puppet state

Unlike Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania who didn't exist until 1991? Or, any of the Eastern European countries? Slovenia? Greece have in now way been more of a puppet or had it tougher than any of those states. Yet, Estonia and Slovenia are supporting Greece through the Eurozone, and the rest of EU through the EU and the IMF. I don't think my country has had anything to do with it, our banks are not involved, at all. 

&gt;If your country really cared about things like this, then you'd add them to the terms of the bailout package instead of constantly asking for reduced rights and wages for the working class and fire sales of strategic assets.

I'm Swedish. Second, you wouldn't have to lower your wages as much as you have if everyone paid their taxes, third - it is your country, why do you have wages that are above your productivity, that is just finacially irresponsible?

&gt; Still, my point stands: the mess would have been created regardless of how responsible Greece was.

Yes, there would most definately have been a mess, no doubt about that. But, perhaps, you'd have been in the place of Ireland, if you have had your corruption, taxes, productivity, industry, salary, politicans in order. Not the best place perhaps, but a lot easier than where you are now.  

&gt;At this point, I'm willing to argue that it would have been better to let Greece default for the Greeks too. If it was done in amicable terms (no economic sanctions against Greece etc) then the economy of Greece would have recovered by now. 

Perhaps. I happen to believe that either some countries default (Greece/Portugal for example) or there have to be a Euro X and Y somehow. There are to many differencies for a single currency. I think it will be horrible for Greece though if you default, you can not borrow on the market at all and all your banks will collaps. 

I don't think the economy would have recovered, but perhaps been going forward at least. 

I understand that Greece is not in a great place, and that austerity is hurting. I just can't see how it can be done differently without defaulting though (which you perhaps should have done). Not cutting down, means either not paying your creditors (= default) or getting more money from the troika, also known as pissed of taxpayers. That is really not feasible up north, and the IMF have been more generous to Greece than they usually are, they can certainly not keep on treating countries nicer because they are European countries. So, somethings got to give I guess.

Not healthcare and education? It's counter-productive to cut on those, not only the benefits make up for the costs on the long term, anyone who runs on cutting these is unelectable. Making these services more efficient? Sure. Cutting them? That's crazy.

And what the politicians want (or should want) to cut back on is on state-owned companies, mindless subsidies and unfair PPPs. Not on the basics like healthcare or education.

&gt;Do you live in another planet?

I live in Portugal, it's between Venus and Mars.

&gt;Yeah, you are living in a dream world buddy, go back to your economics books, where the capitalistic heaven is described.

Nice argument bro.

&gt;It's like there aren't two and a half centuries of capitalistic history to draw conclusions and data from.

There are, and the conclusions are clear, these were much more prosperous societies than those where it was the government rather than private entities the ones running the economy.

&gt;Give me a place and time where ~~capitalism~~ **a society** was corruption free and avoided such problems.

There, FTFY, you tell me a society (capitalistic or not) which was corruption free.

&gt;You won't, because capitalism is all about protecting and promoting the interests of the big companies. Not about ""giving everyone the chance to have a business"".

Nope, capitalism is all about protecting individual freedoms and allowing companies rise and fall based on their performance in a free market.

What you mentioned was corporatism and, just like socialism, it's the opposite of a free market - the role of the state shouldn't be to favour the rich in detriment of the poor or favour the poor in detriment of the rich.

A 100% tax rate on capital gains isn't capitalism just like bailout to companies that prove uncompetitive isn't capitalism. While you have the government actively harming some to benefit others, you won't have a free market, and so you can't point fingers at capitalism because that's not what it is.

&gt;The latter is a necessity and is only allowed in the degree that helps the big ones.

The bigger they are, the harder they fall. If anything, the current situation is proof of that. The moment a business proves uncompetitive and inefficient, it should either adapt or close - if it's bailed out and its life is prolonged artificially at the expense of the taxpayer, then it's further inefficient application of a society's resources.

&gt;If you really agree with this, why don't you say that the people are right to protest when Merkel wants Greece to buy military equipment from them? Or when German companies want cheap access to over-exploit the greek economy?

That's quite easy, Greece can just say ""no"" and not buy military equipment. But this isn't what the protest is about, we both know this is more of the ""don't cut our spending"" protests.

&gt;Because you view protesters as hippies, not as part of people as they are.

No, I don't view the protesters as hippies, I see them as people directly affected by these cuts, the public servants and other interest groups which would be directly affected by a decrease in public spending. I don't hate them, I just strongly disagree with them - what's good for them is bringing the rest of society down with out of control debt.

Unfortunately for Greece, it can no longer afford to waste money on unproductive investments and them continuing to pay for their massive state is unproductive. Their labour market ought to be liberalized and their public sector slashed to what's really necessary and these people directly affected now having a chance of getting another job - on which doesn't rely on taxpayers money and whose output is more inefficient than the service they currently provide while working for the state.

&gt;Of course, taxing 2K a pensioner of 10K income, 10K a family of four with a joint income of 50K and 100K someone with income of 500K are all the same. 2K, 10K and 100K have the same importance to all 3 of them.

This is already a discussion of proportional vs progressive tax rates - not what we're discussing here. In case you didn't noticed, I wasn't arguing for a flat tax rate of 20% but for a maximum of 20% (maybe 25% but maybe that would be pushing too much - there's no magic number, it's up for debate), at no point I said it should be 20% for everyone.

But even if the tax rate was of 20% for everyone, I can guarantee you that someone with an income of 10k would benefit more than a person with an income of 100k. Again, not what we're discussing here, even I don't know for sure what would be the best tax system - what I know for sure is that taxing people 40%, 50% or 60% is outright foolish, that's just making sure everyone that would be wealthy enough to pay for that would just leave the country. It would be much more beneficial to tax 20% or 25% of a lot of rich people than it would be to tax 50% of only a couple of dudes or 100% of nobody because they all left.

&gt;How democratic your claim.

Democratic? We're talking about fairness in the tax rates, not about what the people choose in the ballot when there's an election.

&gt;Are you sure your opinion serves your interests and those of your people and country?

I'm sure that people investing money here, employment being created and the economy recovering is better than everybody leaving the country because doing business here is almost impossible.

&gt;Are you sure this is not giving into the terrorism of EU, IMF and your local big companies?

Yeah, I don't buy into that fear mongering. Terrorism of the EU, lol.

&gt;Well, let me inform you that a lot of profitable or barely-debt-creating-but-providing-important-services-cheaply-to-the-masses public companies were given this treatment because they wanted to sell them to the private sector and that was the only way: public train system, public electricity, public water, public telecommunications-this last one was massively profitable!

The first train systems were owned by the private sector in the UK and then also in the USA. Public electricity and water system, these tend to turn into monopolies but there's no reason to favour a state-owned monopoly over a private one - personally I'd rather have it a well regulated market with always the possibility of new competition propping up than a state-owned that's publicly funded and which doesn't have the same incentives to work efficiently and generate profits. Public telecommunications, again, why should the state own these? The privates don't require taxpayers money, are much more motivated to generate profits, are much less likely to end up being a burden to society and if the state doesn't own them, that's less chances the state will have for having institutions generating jobs for the boys.

&gt;Why did they have to privatize them? Was it for the good of the people?

Because it's not the role of the state to run the economy, because the private sector is much more efficient in doing it and yes it was for the greater good as it helps bringing down public expenditure and it proves to be less of a distraction and lets them focus on what they really should - on providing safety, security, stability and justice to society and on assuring that everyone has access to humane healthcare conditions and a chance of a decent education. This is what matters, not state tv, state transports and state-run economy which always just ends up being a burden for everyone else for little return which would be much higher if it was the private sector providing these services.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Very interesting map! It is quite obvious that Member States with a strong financial sector (i.e. UK, Luxembourg) are opposed to introducing legislation that levies a transaction tax.

The measure which brings up a plan for such a tax is Commission Proposal COM (2011) 594 of 28 September 2011 (source: http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/other_taxes/financial_sector/com%282011%29594_en.pdf). 

So, can the EU implement such a measure?

Looking at the map and seeing that some Member States oppose the measure the answer is: Probably not.
This is due to the legal basis being Article 113 TFEU (EU may adopt measures for taxation). The procedure for adopting this measure would be a special legislative procedure that requires unanimity in the Council. Since this will not happen the EU will probably not be able to levy a financial transaction tax.

Are there alternatives to bring such a tax? 
Probably not. Enhanced co-operation, a procedure where a group of at least 9 Member States can adopt legislation binding among themselves, will not be possible. adopting a financial transaction tax on a regional level would distort the functioning of the internal market (Art. 114 TFEU etc.) and would not be permissible. Financial Institutions situated in Member States where this measure would be applicable would be at a comparative disadvantage to financial institutions in other Member States not adopting the measure.
Member States may act through their national law (taxation under EU law require unanimity since it is a core part of the powers of a sovereign states; the Members States are therefore very protective in this area). There could, however, still be a concern about the fucntioning of the internal market and, what is even worse, 'emigration' of financial institutions to other member States that have better conditions (which is, to my knowledge, already happening).

Two thoughts should be kept in mind here:

1.) High frequency trading would be gravely affected. A lot of politicians want to 'reign in' the banking sector as to stop future financial meltdowns. These people often neglect the fact that HFT also brings benefits such as higher liquidation and less costs involving broker fees (http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/10/06/the-problem-with-high-frequency-trading/ seen on Reddit a couple of days ago :) ). Therefore, penalizing HFT per se is wrong.

2.) The EU wanted to use the tax money to fund itself (it's in the proposal). This is interesting since usually the Member States fund the EU and use the funding as a political bargaining tool (recently the UK is doing this; see: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.yahoo.com%2Fuks-cameron-tells-europe-veto-eu-budget-164754764--business.html&amp;ei=B310UMqYILGR0QXRlIHYCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEv82cTh3XRBvDWqkAPxAcxiLDgig).

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;You're an anarchocapitalist

According to wikipedia:

&gt;In an anarcho-capitalist society, law enforcement, courts, and all other security services would be provided by privately funded competitors rather than through taxation

lol, this is so utterly retarded. No, I'm not an anarchist.

&gt;or other denomination of extreme-free-market-ism, aren't you?

Yes, I believe a free market is much more efficient than a government run economy at providing for the general welfare of everyone. You don't?

&gt;Otherwise, you wouldn't ask a question like this. [Here you go.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers_rights#Core_Labor_Standards)

So let's see:

&gt;* Freedom of association: workers are able to join trade unions that are independent of government and employer influence;
&gt;* The right to collective bargaining: workers may negotiate with employers collectively, as opposed to individually;
&gt;* The prohibition of all forms of forced labor: includes security from prison labor and slavery, and prevents workers from being forced to work under duress;
&gt;* Elimination of the worst forms of child labor: implementing a minimum working age and certain working condition requirements for children;
&gt;* Non-discrimination in employment: equal pay for equal work.

Hey! I agree with all of these! I honestly do! If these are the workers' rights you demand, you're absolutely right, anything else would be unfair. Forgive me, I thought you were talking about the other kind of ""workers' rights"" like the impossibility of firing someone or forcing companies to continue to provide for their workers even long after they are no longer employed there! My bad!

&gt;That's my point; even though individually each country has an incentive to lower their taxes and workers' rights and all that, at the end of the day we all* gain something if countries cooperate and raise them instead.

&gt;*=except the rich, I guess

Firstly, most countries hardly have any incentives to lower their taxes (the more money the state receives, the more power the politicians have) or their workers' rights (this one is kinda silly, any politician that wanted to cut back on these would probably never get elected - they have all the incentives to support them and favour them even more - considering this is a democracy, of course).

Secondly, what's your problem with the rich? Just because some people are wealthier than others, that doesn't make them worse - they might be more annoying but they're entitled to the same rights as everybody else and always throughout history there have been people who were better off than others. I don't understand what's your problem with them, it's like you want to punish them simply for being rich. I'd rather work and one day be rich as well than spending my life hating on them!",0,1349813391,null,0,false,0,c6k0wc2,t3_115gs8,t1_c6k0wc2,t1_c6k0mpn,null,1430105440,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,costas_md,null,null,"&gt;&gt;Yeah, you are living in a dream world buddy, go back to your economics books, where the capitalistic heaven is described.

&gt;Nice argument bro.

I didn't say that to insult you. I truly believe that reality contradicts your claims about the miracles that capitalism has to offer to the masses today. Of course in the 19th century it was a great jump forwards for humanity, but that is not true today for the majority of people. I believe that you don't understand how have things like 8 working hours, right to education, right to free speech, right to health care and any other freedom you have today is achieved. They are not given as gifts, and are certainly to be taken back in the first chance. I truly believe you haven't thrown a glance at the key moments in the labor history of the past 2 centuries.

1. You say that politicians should not want to cut on health and education, yet you completely miss the fact that they are indeed cut all over the world and are heavily pushed on Greece by the troica
2. You say that say that in a capitalistic free market everything would be working well, yet you can only point me to Switzerland for that imaginary thing, and everywhere there are strict regulations and interference from national governments. If governments didn't regulate and interfere they would be called ""arbiters"" or ""reporting agencies"". There wouldn't even be a need to have those bloody elections every four years
3. You claim that Greece could simply not buy from Germany, yet you neglect the obvious fact that a country like Greece is heavily economically and politically dependent from countries like Germany and USA. Really, dependency is not just a phenomenon of capitalism, it's documented throughout the history.
4. You claim that the role of the state is not to run businesses, yet you claim that the state should really run health care, education and military (I wouldn't disagree with you), some of the biggest sectors, and that are quite profitable if run like businesses.
5. You claim that businesses run by the public sector are of no cost to the taxpayers, yet when those same taxpayers will try to use them it would be much more costly for them because companies will try to make a buck, something that does not always mean better services or cheap fares.
6. You want a government that does not interfere with the free market, yet I am sure you don't want monopolies and cartels to be formed. (Of course you could say that you don't have problem with monopolies and cartels, but I assume that it's logical given your replies)
7. You say that capitalism is about protecting individual freedoms, but what does the word ""freedom"" mean when you politicians put the interests of the big companies above the interests of the people? How are you free when you don't have a job, don't have health care, are being heavily policed and the big companies report big profits?

In order to have big profits you must exploit *some* people. It might not be your country's, or the one of the neighbor's. But there is a massive amount of people being over exploited somewhere, and if the society accepts this (which it has come to accept) it's not difficult for your turn to come to be over exploited in the name of profit. Of course then they will say that ""the economy will not survive if you take your fair share"".

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;You say that politicians should not want to cut on health and education, yet you completely miss the fact that they are indeed cut all over the world and are heavily pushed on Greece by the troica

They aren't cut all over the world and troika isn't cutting back on healthcare and education, it's simply cutting back on the excessive public spending.

&gt;You say that say that in a capitalistic free market everything would be working well, yet you can only point me to Switzerland for that imaginary thing, and everywhere there are strict regulations and interference from national governments. If governments didn't regulate and interfere they would be called ""arbiters"" or ""reporting agencies"". There wouldn't even be a need to have those bloody elections every four years

Unfortunately a lot of other places aren't real direct democracies like Switzerland and once a certain group gets hold of power, they tend to deviate from a free market which is best for all of society to another system which is slightly better for the people in power but overall worse to the rest of society.

The USA isn't a free market, the USSR wasn't a free market, a dictatorship (pre-1974) Portugal wasn't a free market, a democratic (post-1974) Portugal isn't a free market, etc etc etc. Switzerland, on the other hand, has always kept a balance of power through direct democracy and because of that, they've been a free market for the longest time and their development and economic success is proof of that.

&gt;You claim that Greece could simply not buy from Germany, yet you neglect the obvious fact that a country like Greece is heavily economically and politically dependent from countries like Germany and USA. Really, dependency is not just a phenomenon of capitalism, it's documented throughout the history.

I was talking about military hardware. If Greece doesn't need it, why should they buy it? Aren't they rational?

&gt;You claim that the role of the state is not to run businesses, yet you claim that the state should really run health care, education and military (I wouldn't disagree with you), some of the biggest sectors, and that are quite profitable if run like businesses.

No, I said the state should run the police, the fire-fighters, the military and the courts. These aren't businesses, these are areas which have always been in the sphere of the state.

As for healthcare and education, I didn't say that the state should run them, I said they should assure that everyone must have access - which is to say, private hospitals and private schools but the state paying a percentage of the cost of the user (though this is only my opinion, to combine the efficiency of the free market with the social democracy of allowing everyone regardless of background and financial situation to have access to healthcare and education - others might disagree).

&gt;You claim that businesses run by the public sector are of no cost to the taxpayers, yet when those same taxpayers will try to use them it would be much more costly for them because companies will try to make a buck, something that does not always mean better services or cheap fares.

No, I said that businesses run by the **private** sector are of no cost to the taxpayer, which is true, unlike state-owned companies, the privates aren't financed by the taxpayers.

Oh, and of course that companies will try to make a buck, who doesn't? Even the state does that, everything has its price. It's why you need a free market, to allow competition and to make sure you reach a price of equilibrium, where demand meets supply and the price is fair from everyone.

If you indeed want to bring the prices down, you'll support this system - it's the only one that makes sure these companies will try their best to deliver their products as cheap as possible or with as much quality as possible (otherwise they'd be put out of business). This is a much better alternative than a state-monopoly. Oh, and you said this is costlier which is false, the price which might be higher on the spot is actually lower because the state won't tax you as much. Regardless of who offers the service, it has to be paid for - and the private sector is the only one who has in its best interest to make it the best possible.

&gt;You want a government that does not interfere with the free market, yet I am sure you don't want monopolies and cartels to be formed. (Of course you could say that you don't have problem with monopolies and cartels, but I assume that it's logical given your replies)

A free market is strictly against monopolies. It's not free if the supply is only offered by one entity. While there are cases where monopolies may be formed naturally (like when the marginal costs are decreasing - which require a big initial investment but then it gets easier to provide the service to more people), these are the exception and can be regulated. You seem to forget that in these cases, privately-owned or state-owned, it's always a monopoly nevertheless - the private sector may have the benefit of maximizing profits with the lack of competition (as long as they don't push it too much, if they did, they'd be allowing competition to prop up and putting them out of business as the competition would probably drive these out of business) but the state continues to not have the incentive to maximize efficiency and if they are careless with their spending, it's all of society that will have to pay through taxes.

&gt;You say that capitalism is about protecting individual freedoms, but what does the word ""freedom"" mean when you politicians put the interests of the big companies above the interests of the people? How are you free when you don't have a job, don't have health care, are being heavily policed and the big companies report big profits?

When a politician puts the interests of corporations above the one of his voters, he's not a capitalist or a believer in a free market, he's a corporatist and a defender of the powers that be. This is the opposite of a free market because he's taking a stance and not letting the free market decide who should get what. This is outright corruption and is also anti-democratic. Again, check Switzerland, they don't seem to have any of this there because they're a direct democracy.",0,1349817688,null,0,false,0,c6k24lc,t3_116uuf,t1_c6k24lc,t1_c6k1fgn,null,1430106086,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0
