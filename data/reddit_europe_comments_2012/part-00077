Wenn jetzt der Bürger von seinem Standpunkt nachgibt und sich auf einen Kompromiss einlässt dann haben Leute wie Friedrich schon gewonnen denn 50% von dem was gefordert wurde ist immernoch 50% mehr als man vorher bereit war zu akzeptieren.

Um deine Ausführung aufzugreifen: Es ist bereits mit bestehenden Gesetzen und unter den gegebenen Bedingungen möglich Straftaten wie die Beleidigungs Özils zu verfolgen.

Lassen wir mal alle Szenarien außen vor die solche Ermittlungen erschweren. Willst du ein Land in dem man für einen dummen Spruch auf Twitter die Polizei ins Haus geschickt bekommt? Sowas hatten wir schonmal ... Gestapo und so.

For the sake of clarification, what I mean to say is this: the media narrative of the last few months sketches a reality where violence against immigrants is rampant all over Greece. You seem to be saying that, according to the official statistics, xenophobic attacks have not actually grown in number and the media attempt to hinder the rise of Golden Dawn.

I totally agree with your second point and let's assume that I agree with the first one as well. Would this mean that I should adopt a more relaxed attitude towards GD? I doubt that. The fact that GD supports violence against immigrants is indisputable; the fact that such attacks have taken place is easily verifiable. Considering the part of the vote GD received, it becomes clear to me that GD poses a serious risk to immigrants' fundamental rights.

That's why I tend to view favorably the propaganda that the media have unleashed against GD, despite recognizing it as such. Bear in mind that propaganda does not necessarily entail blatantly lying about what has happened; one can distort reality simply by shifting focus.

Well, I don't care about the financial situation in where-ever-the-fuck-you're-from either, but I thought you'd have brains enough to realise that countries only remain in the EU because it's in their financial interest to do so. 

&gt;  I just wish that you would either leave the EU and do your own thing, or to stop whining and obstructing and be a constructive partner.

There are two problems here. Firstly, as far as I'm concerned the whining is all coming from the continent. The sentence you wrote, that I have quoted above, is in itself, a little whine about how you ""just wish you would leee-hee-heeave"". 

Everyone in the EU is looking out for their own interests. Germany is busy raping southern Europe with the Euro crisis, and protecting it's industry, and France is still busy extracting wealth to prop up its medieval farming industry. But when the UK acts on behalf of its own business interests, all of a sudden we are *obstructive*. What a joke. What brazen hypocrisy. 

Secondly, we *are* being constructive. Debate and disagreement is *healthy*. Especially if the fate of 500 million people is concerned. It is something to be *desired*, not suppressed. And yet in the EU, and deviation from *the grand plan* is treated with a creepy kind of patronising dismissal, rather like you're doing now. Not everyone has the same vision for Europe, and I am *glad* that that is the case.

I'll give you that, but it's still the same language though.

&gt;By that criteria, we could as well be Spanish or Brazilian.

No we could not, our culture is unique and different from those two.

&gt;It once was. Don't tell me you support what this idiot did.

Yes, but people still felt Portuguese even overseas, and those who didn't caused trouble just like there will be trouble caused by those who don't feel as EU citizens in a federalised EU.

&gt;Don't tell me you support what this idiot did.

I'm offended.

&gt;Less than 40 years ago you had separatist movements in the Azores, in Madeira and in Algarve, and you still have Portuguese people in Olivença, in the former colonies and all over the world, this union is hardly natural.

Your asking for too much. It's certainly more natural and stable than a federalised EU would be.

&gt;How is this an hindrance in the effort to bring peace, stability and prosperity to Europe, if it's a cause we all can back up?

It's an hindrance because you will be trying to force something artificial down the throats of Europeans. Most people want a EU of free trade and cooperation, not a EU superstate with power centralized in Brussels.

&gt;No, you don't, you're sensing fear of the unknown and are speculating about the future, predicting only the worst possible outcomes.

Your right, still I feel very strongly that my prediction will come true.

&gt;What about it? Perhaps then there will be more intelligent people in the financial sector, perhaps we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place if there was a unified response to these problems. Does it really matter if the guy making choices isn't in Lisbon but rather in Brussels?

The guy in Lisbon is closer and represents less people. Power should be decentralized, not the opposite, atleast imo.

&gt;I also want further integration, and I'm only willing to accept it if it's done with the consent of the people. Otherwise it would be too painful, even with all the benefits, I'd die if I had to listen to that speech all the fucking time.

I'm afraid you will be disappointed, just speculating though :)

Within the Low German area, there are huge differences. In the Dutch (Netherlands) Low German parts alone, everyone could easily tell someone speaking 'grunnegs-oostfrais', 'twaents' or 'achterhooks' (sic) apart.

I grew up in the Achterhoek area, even though I wasn't fluent in the dialect, I could understand it quite well. People I went to school could be sorted out by ear. The school was in a small town which served as a commercial and cultural centre for all the surrounding villages. Maybe you couldn't pinpoint the exact village, but often you could tell a general direction. What happened in the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century must still play a part, because you could tell by the language if the village was protestant, like most of the area, or one of the Catholic villages.

One of my teachers, a local authority on 'nedersaksisch', told us stories how 2 generations ago, you could very acurately tell what village someone was from, by the way they talked. And skip back a few generations, it was said that farms were often so isolated, your accent could give away your very home.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;**Firstly,let's start with the figures once more,then on the actual argument. It seems,upon closer investigation and looking through yet other source of information about the EU budget contributions, the figures of open Europe once more don't add up,even when considering the reduction of rebate,Tony was ''so good'' at negotiating for us.**

I'll go through them but I have also provided alternative sources, that give the UK EU deficit less (which still work), but the Open Europe sources do come from the UK government for the EU Spend.

&gt;**Nevertheless, I am not sure how they get the 57 billion figure - do you want to claim that starting with 2007,we had a net contribution of approx 10 billion each year(as that would make 10x5 = 50 billion). This is clearly a nonsense, Please see - http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN00864.pdf It was last updated on 28th of October, and states that UK's net contribution was 3.0 billion,rising to 4.7 billion in 2009/2010.**

It's sad for both of us that we have to argue of what was paid to the EU, it should be black and white, but the link is  to the direct EU budget for administration alone.  CAP, CFP, grants, all of it, omitted.  The French government alone admits to paying a NET €48.3bn, after coming under UK pressure to release its figures, the UK government admits to paying over €57bn NET over a budget period (5 years).

That's what the governments begrudgingly admit to after playing it down, way in excess of the pink book, and the pink book way in excess of what you just claimed - because you only got the net administrative cost.

&gt;**Furthermore it says that the estimate is approximately 7.7 billion in 2010/11, clearly even when taking the average - say 5.5 billion per year contribution, it works out as 27.5 billion,far fetched from the 57 billion ''deficit we currently have'' openeurope document claims.**

Check the document's sources.  You're only looking at one aspect of the budget, not the total budget or contribution.   Open Europe quotes the Pink Book.  The official budget accounts of the UK government!

&gt;**Clealy, the CAP money we receive is spent wastefully, and must be re-negotiated. But this,as you say,is a motive of renegotiation.This brings me to my main point.**

HEY!  I knew I liked you although we tend to disagree.  WE AGREE!!! 

I've not read down yet.  Hopefully you're not going to say 'But the CFP is working...'

&gt;**There is Clearly a need to renegotiate our conditions in terms of contribution to the EU budget and how we get our money back (rebate and the wasteful CAP etc)- Which,of course is the first major problem.**

Wait.

Are you the person that said renegotiation was, 

               ""You are aware that those words are just 
                reality-bitting lies,aren't you?"" 

to my statement of: 

               ""Complete withdrawal from the EU, probably not, 
                but a serious renegotiation of terms more akin 
                to the Norwegian model outside the EU, but 
                essentially still in with far less say but far fewer 
                obligations.""

The problem with CAP is it is designed for continent sized farming.  There is no comparable.  The UK has far fewer, EU states have far more, the UK farms are generally far bigger, the EU state farms are generally quite smaller.  

There is no compromise there.  As a net contributor there is no more money, nobody can give more and they give to the installation - across the EU.  That's the problem.  If an EU farmer gets a grant whatever he gets across his farm, will always be more than what a UK farmer gets.  They tried it another way.  Try driving across France to go on a skiing holiday.  You'll see it everywhere.  Tiny little 1/16ths or 1/8ths of an acre lined with straight trees.  A farmer in every one, or sometimes the same farmer for several taking EU grants for land he couldn't farm anyway.  It's as simple as this - the UK farmer can't compete fairly, and he can't even compete corruptly because the UK is land restricted.  We're little.  The other 26 nations are not, cannot, break with this - they're too heavily indebted.

The UK can however drop its CAP input and pay its own farmer's more appropriate subsidy, but the UK can never overturn an EU wide farming consensus.  They have small farms.

No choice other than to leave the CAP.

&gt;**I completaly agree with you. I can see your point now**

I don't care if you're a man, I still want to hug you...

&gt;**while hopefully remaining in the 2nd speed of europe**

Technically that makes you a Euro-sceptic.  Don't worry.   The shame wears off after a while and then after 3 months we send you a free pair of slippers and a dressing gown.  We're a fun bunch really, if you like being grumpy!

One of us!    

One of us!     

One of us!

&gt;**Sidenote - why are you still not in government,power holding positions or some kind of pressure group or quango?**

You flatter me but the simple reason is people that go into politics think they're good enough to represent people like you.  People like me know we're not good enough to represent people like you.  That sounds like a compliment, and it is, but in reality can you imagine how self-idolising you'd have to be to run a country?  To actually stand there and think, 'I might have been elected, but I AM actually the best person for the job.'

&gt;**unrealistic view of UKIP or the pro-EU view of some people(who'd still like the UK to adopt euro at the current climate)**

UKIP might have talked of grandeur but it was always ever going to be a lobby group, a talking point.  I can't believe Farrage for a second, and he is a smart man even if he is pugilistic when he talks, thought he'd ever run the country.  Yet we talk about him and UKIP.  Maybe that's all UKIP needed to do.  Not to agree with them outright, or at all, but to represent the other side of the spectrum.  Say what you will but when the BNP tried to infiltrate their meeting and offered not to run against any of their candidates, UKIP (to their own great expense), after calling the police to have them removed voted to contest any BNP candidate they could so no anti-EU person should ever have to resort to the BNP.  I don't like much of their policies, but you have to respect that.


&gt;**P.S. I hope the current crisis might shift the EU institutions to be much more transparent and open,as part of the closer union the core of Eurozone seems to be streaming towards. Or completaly the opposite - become much more beaurocratic,ineffective and unprepresentative if it moves towards more Federal Europe.**

It looks like they're going to get a lot bigger and with 500 citizens it's difficult to know who what representative is, or what he's doing.  And that's a problem.

true,r0ckarong,flag-de,,"&gt; Es muss doch dafür irgendwo, irgendeine Zuordnung geben, wer beispielsweise vorgestern unter einer bestimmten IP im Netz war. Das ist doch schon eine VDS-light?

Das kommt darauf an wie man ""Vorrat"" definiert. Die Vorratsdatenspeicherung bedeutet ja das Daten ungeachtet ihrer Verwendung vorgehalten werden. Wenn man sich typische Breitbandanschlüsse ansieht wechseln die ihre IP alle paar Tage/Wochen. Mein ADSL Modem von Unitymedia z.B. behält die gleiche IP bis ich das Ding von Hand resette oder im Admin Menü eine neue IP anfordere (und selbst dann bekomme ich manchmal die gleiche zugeordnet). Ein Provider muss, aus technischen Gründen, wissen welcher Anschluss welche IP in seinem Netzwerk zugewiesen bekommt damit die Server Daten korrekt verteilen können. 

Der Unterschied erklärt sich in etwa so: Du weisst dass du einer Anzahl von Familienmitgliedern Weihnachtskarten schicken willst, also kaufst du genug Karten um allen eine schicken zu können. Das ist kein Vorrat. Du hast genau die Anzahl die du brauchst. 

Vorrat wäre wenn du einhundert Karten kaufst obwohl du nicht einmal weisst ob du Karten verschicken willst.

Ergo ist die technisch mögliche Zuordnung noch keine ""VDS-light"" da diese nicht dem Zweck einer Vorratshaltung dient.

Das ISPs ihre Kunden zuordnen können wird sich nicht verhindern lassen. Dass jetzt allerdings eine Regierung, ohne konkreten Anlass, verlangen kann dass sie permanent alle Kunden quasi überwachen halte ich für gefährlich. Die Ansicht dass es möglich sein muss zu wissen wer vorgestern mit welcher IP im Netz war greift argumentativ wieder in dein Auto-Beispiel. Um zu wissen wer vorgestern mit welchem Auto unterwegs war lässt sich entweder fallbezogen ermitteln (d.h. man lässt das Zielauto bei einem konkreten Verdacht observieren) oder man macht eine verdachtsunabhängige Rasterfahndung. Dann sind wir schnell wieder bei der totalen Überwachung. 

Das große Problem an der VDS (wenn man sich mal die Positionen der Gegner ansieht) ist ja nicht dass die Aktivisten gegen Strafverfolgung sind ... wir wissen nur aus hinreichend dokumentierten Erfahrungen dass die Behörden (sobald sie das Mittel einmal in der Hand halten) davon missbräuchlichen Gebrauch machen *werden*. Daher kann man mit Leuten die nachweislich ihre Überwachungsmaßnahmen missbrauchen keine anständige Diskussion über Einschränkungen oder Implementationen führen. Es gibt einige Studien die belegen dass die VDS in keinem gezeigten Fall zu einer Verbesserung der Ermittlungsquote führt (gegenüber den ohnehin existierenden Maßnahmen wie Quick-Freeze etc.). Also warum soll man eine weitere Einschränkung der Privatsphäre in Kauf nehmen wenn dieses belegbar keine Vorteile bringt und nur Missbrauch seitens der Ermittlungsbehörden und Überwacher ermöglicht?",0,1340400750,null,0,false,0,c54967r,t3_vepgx,t1_c54967r,t1_c5454o8,null,1429206706,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

Now, if all the downvoters could explain to me *just how* on Gods Green Earth it isn't true that in the last 100 years more (historically interesting) stuff happened on European soil than on North American soil…

Most places are rather inexpensive except for Munich. The further north or east you go (except for bavaria) the cheaper it becomes. You can live off 500-600€ a month in Germany (outside Munich), especially if you live in a dorm (which are usually very different from the ones in the US).

If you can read German, you will probably do fine in German classes as well. A lot of the classes are designed in a way that you can take the exam without attending the lecture once, so even if you can't follow it 100%, you'll probably be fine as there usually is a script or book that the lecture follows to the word more or less (and it's mostly free or maybe 25€max.).

The non-technical unis that teach stuff like medicine, law, philosophy, ... Most of the exist in cities that already have TU, like the LMU Munich or the FU or HU in Berlin. Other adresses would be Heidelberg or Freiburg.

I think you greatly underplay the (historical) value of the World Wars and the Cold War.

In terms of war, the only noteworthy event **in** North America was 9/11. Europe saw several genocides, tremendous wars, incredible levels of devastation.

In terms of politics, North America has been incredibly boring. No revolution, no change of government. Sure, a lot of legal stuff is always happening that, the USA being a world power, has had some global consequences. Compare that to fascism, anarchism, communism, capitalism, socialism, different democracies, and several major revolutions in Europe over the last 100 years.

Economically speaking, North America has seen a more-or-less constant rise in prosperity (the Black Friday was paralleled in Europe by the depression.) The wars, on the other hand, caused great economic turmoil in Europe.

Socially, North America has had interesting developments: racial segregation and its demise being the prime example. But so did Europe with racism, and the end of Imperialism.

What I'm trying to say is: take a Russian from 1912, one from 1950, and one from 2012, and you'll find that they all have different forms of government, vastly different living conditions, and a different outlook on life. Same for Germans from 1912, 1920, 1939, 1950, 1991, 2012 (Germany's history in particular has been quite turbulent.)

Take an American from a hundred years ago, and one from today, and the only thing I see greatly changed is perhaps a lessened sense of optimism about the state of the world and the USA's place in it. They still have the same government, the same economic paradigm, the same systems of education and trade, and probably even similar values (I'm talking about the average person.)",0,1340404590,null,0,false,0,c54a29x,t3_vfry7,t1_c54a29x,t1_c549tjs,null,1429207117,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

You may keep up to 150 euros * your age (min. 3.100/max. 9.750) + 750 euros and a car if it's not worth more than 7.500 euros. (There are also other exceptions but I don't think they apply to you, for instance for old age pension, houses/condos you use yourself and inherited valuables.)

Especially if your bank account is in USD that might become a problem due to the fluctuating exchange rates.

If you don't report your assets correctly, congratulations, you've just committed fraud.

Once you're in the German medical insurance system, you aren't going to need a fund for medical emergencies. No matter how many doctors you are visiting, how many medications you take or how long you stay in the hospital, you will never need to pay more than two percent of your yearly income. If you don't have any income or an income on or below Hartz IV level, the minimum yearly deductable of 89.76 euros applies.

Keep in mind the state will take care of you if you're really broke. You do not need savings for true emergencies - as a German citizen you will always have shelter, food and medical care. So if you really need money - the entire Hartz IV process can be done in English, too.

It is frowned upon for *everyone*.  Everyone I know would be ashamed to take ALGII, and the indignity that comes with it.  For anyone with an ounce of self respect, it's a last resort when all else fails.  I doubt that you really know what happens when you sign up for ALGII:

* It can take months for the government to decide whether or not to give you money.  If you're planning on using it to get an apartment, take that into account.  Also consider that you'll have to find a landlord willing to take you on HartzIV.  Many won't, for obvious reasons.
* It is possible that you will be denied and told to move back to America.  Your passport is one of convenience and although you do technically have legal entitlement to welfare, much depends on the caseworker's mood and you can't expect to find much sympathy from anyone.
* Every single aspect of your life will be taken into account, starting with your finances.  If you have too much savings in your American bank account, you will be denied.  You'll probably need to have your documents officially translated, which might be expensive.
* Once you sign up, they *own you*.  They can tell you that they found you a job picking up dogshit with your hands for €1 an hour and you will have to take it.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; Yes, and the thing that gets me is that, especially on this subreddit, the people who are calling for more federalization and a stronger union are often the same people complaining about German taxpayers footing the bill for Greece's faults.

If you're talking about me, then you've misunderstood a couple of things. This also, very roughly, matches the general policy of the German government, so it's not that far fetched (*very* general -- I didn't vote for them and disagree on what could on this very high level be seen as details, but I see where Merkel is coming from). The general principle is that you can't have a currency union without institutionalized internal transfers, but you also can't have internal transfers without a financial union, and you need a political union to have that in a stable and democratically legitimized manner.  
With those preconditions met, internal transfers become both a stabilizing factor and an investment into a common future that will pay off for everybody, without those preconditions, they are politically destabilizing and will almost inevitably lead to an ugly breakup that will be very expensive both politically and economically. This is related to your last point:

&gt; The main reason I'm generally opposed to more federalization is because I seriously don't think the leaders and policy makers are capable enough and could work together well enough for it to be successful.

I know we all like to bitch about our governments, but those people aren't stupid. Usually, if what they do doesn't seem to make any sense, then they either have different priorities from yours (and those could be personal), or you overlook political, economically or legal constraints within which they have to operate.

That aside, the status quo is that the power in the EU and in the Eurozone is very clearly with fully sovereign national governments, who answer to their own domestic electorate and act in the interest of their own country, and follow those countries' long term policy goals. That's where their priorities are, always, and they have to stay within those aforementioned constraints. As we see especially these days, those priorities and goals can be contrary to those of other governments, and their constraints don't always have much of an overlap.

Before the crisis, this made decision making on the EU level difficult, because we had to rely on people who were representing national interests to decide common policy. Now, we have a situation where the threat of economic collapse has become both a driver of decision making as well as a policy instrument. Syriza almost won the elections on a platform that their European policy spokesman expressed as *""If we left the euro, the financial markets would attack Italy. If you owe 3000 euros to the bank and don't pay, they will kill you. If you owe 10 billion euros, they will do everything for you.""*

So, the apparent inability to work together in the common interest is not an argument *against* federalization, it's an argument *for* federalization, with a strong European Parliament and a common government that answers to the European electorate as a whole and has actual powers, instead of leaving it to a bunch of people who primarily act according to often contrary national interests, because:

&gt; It seems to me that there should have been specific plans for this that included regulations that would have prevented Greece, Spain, etc. from getting this deep into their respective financial messes.

We had those rules, almost everybody ignored them, including Germany (not Spain, though, but lets not get into the different causes for the respective economies problems), and they could because of their almost full sovereignty. Multiple Greek governments even went as far as cooking the books to veil just how much they were in violation, but due to their sovereignty and, this time diplomatic, constraints, nobody could step up and demand to check their statistics and accounting. To do so would have been a clear violation of their sovereignty and of protocol.
  
Those regulations that you propose, *hard* regulations that restrict a country's budgetary sovereignty to prevent them from threatening the economic stability of the whole, are just that -- restrictions of countries' sovereignty. If you transfer sovereignty to a higher supranational body, the democratic deficit becomes an even bigger issue than it already is, and the question of whether or not to form a federation becomes one of democratic legitimacy, apart from ""just"" a necessity to make it all work.

Those insights aren't new, this has all been well understood since even before the euro was formed. But because countries just don't like giving up sovereignty, and because their national interests and political considerations of their government aren't always aligned, to put it mildly, we hadn't addressed this issue before the introduction of the euro and not in the now fourteen years after it. Because, as you have observed, our governments don't seem to be capable of properly working together, I, for one, have little faith that they will manage to agree on something like that after the crisis has passed, if it even will without a breakup.

So, if we have those transfers now, without the framework of a future federation to address the underlying problems at least roughly outlined and agreement on a path towards it, we'd be back to where we were before, only this time we would have set a precedent of how to handle this kind of situation when (not if) it reoccurs -- there's no need to accept politically inconvenient restrictions on national sovereignty or to maintain a responsible budget policy, because in the end, the other countries have no choice to bail you out. A.k.a., ""moral hazard"".

&gt; Maybe I'm naive, but I thought that one of the points of the eurozone was to help make the weak economies become stronger.

Again a misunderstanding. The euro is primarily a political construct, the motivations were national security, irreversibility and acceleration of economic entanglement, a politically integrating effect, and *then* some positive economic side effects, in that order.

1. Comparing 1933 with 2012 where Germany is integrated into the European Union and diplomacy is nothing like it was in 1933 is completely ludicrous. I'm sure everyone knows Merkel is in a very strong negotiation position. Guess why. Because public politics and internal politics are not at all the same. 
The EU works with a complicated political system. Influence and leverage are hugely important factors in defining EU policy. Merkel has both. She needs to play the ""Iron Frau"" to the outside for two reasons. German domestic politics and maintaining her powerful position in negotiations. Merkel is known for her pragmatism and open-mindedness. She does not zealously support austerity. She doesn't support anything zealously. That's a completely false image built up by foreign media. There is no arguing here, it's simply false.

2. The premise is wrong. The left in Germany IS challenging Merkel's narrative. For one you cannot equate Social Democratic SPD with ""the left"". The Socialists Die Linke have completely questioned everything Merkel does. Even the SPD does not simply support Merkel in everything. They are a centrist party. They support a little more leftist approach than Merkel, but they also support fiscal responsibility. What do you expect of a centrist party? Let me repeat that for clarity: German politics is not nearly as polarised as it was in the Weimar Republic. The SPD and the CDU are ultra centrist parties (moreso than Zentrum ever was). Completely false premise.

3. What exactly is Munchau referring to? Social narrative? What year are we talking about here exactly? Is this ""dominant social narrative"" supposed to be anti-Semitism. Let's suppose it is. Are we REALLY comparing the widespread support of a balanced budget with the widespread support of anti-Semitism. Is this really what's happening? 
Or is he referring to economic policies of the Brüning government? If so, as I said earlier, they are not comparable. I can sum it up again quickly: Merkel is not in the slightest a dogmatist, a zealot of any ideology but a hardcore pragmatist, additionally Merkel's position, even now, is not nearly as cemented as the media makes it out to be.

I'm with you on banks. Foreign banks fueled Spanish and Irish property bubbles. That's not controlled by any government though. The Spanish government can't really control what its banks do, but it can control the climate of the Spanish economy. They can make it easy for such a bubble to build up, or they can try to prevent it.

The self-regulation and laissez-faire myth is debunked. We all know that.

i agree with you on solutions too. I'm not saying what is happening now is the correct way necessarily. I think in general, there is no clear solution. There are no easy answers. I personally would like to see real fiscal union on an EU level, and then I think we should set up something like a Marshall plan. A big goal. Something big to strive to, something that energises everything. I don't think that possible without fiscal union, though.

I was merely annoyed by all the people who blame German exports for the Euro crisis. That's ridiculous. That may be one factor that plays together with the mismanagement, but it is not the cause. That's what I wanted to bring across.

Cameron actually supports integration of the Eurozone (although obviously not of the EU). From a US perspective, it doesn't matter how we solve the crisis as long as we do so quickly. I don't think they care much about whether or not we find a long term solution, but if you're paranoid then something like federalization would remove any doubts about the euro's long term stability, which is what had held it back from seeing eye to eye with the dollar as a reserve currency.

Si no trabajas ni vas a clase diariamente es seguro que no necesitas un coche para vivir en una ciudad española. En las ciudades españolas la gente no suele usar el coche si no es para ir al trabajo, y se suele desplazar caminando porque las tiendas, los bares y los restaurantes están en las mismas zonas que las viviendas. Para desplazamientos más largos suelen usar el transporte público: incluso mucha gente lo usa para ir a trabajar o a clase porque les es más cómodo o les resulta más rentable que un coche.

*¿Sería mejor vivir solo o con una familia de la region en cual viviré?*

Puedes compartir piso con otros estudiantes, así ellos pueden ayudarte los primeros días. Las familias no suelen alquilar habitaciones, es más normal que los estudiantes universitarios y gente joven comparta piso.

*¿Hay ciudades en cuales podría vivir fácilmente yo?*

Creo que no hay mucha diferencia entre ciudades. ¿Cuáles te gustan? Recuerda que España es del tamaño de Texas y somos muy parecidos.

*¿Son simpaticos los nativos a los extranjeros (esp. Americanos)?*
Sí, totalmente. En España nos gusta mucho la fiesta y el contacto con otras personas, como sabrás. Por ejemplo, un nuevo compañero belga en nuestro trabajo viene siempre con nosotros a tomar cervezas desde que llegó.

*¿Es caro vivir en una ciudad española?*
Los precios son más baratos que otros países europeos (como Francia, Inglaterra o Suiza). Madrid o Barcelona son más caras que otras ciudades, como Granada (donde yo vivo).

*¿Qué sería mejor hacer con respeto al transporte: autobús, bicicleta, coche, o algo diferente?*
Depende de la ciudad, pero desgraciadamente no hay tanta cultura de bicicleta como en Holanda, por ejemplo. Hay más cultura de transporte público (mucho más que en USA, donde todo el mundo tiene coche por la configuración de muchas de vuestras ciudades). Recuerda que la gasolina es MUY cara (mucho más que en USA), así que no te recomiendo coche.

true,Foxkilt,FRAN,France,"Full translation (my financial English is not as good as it should be, extrapolate if needed):

&gt;Everyone seems to focus on the German bill for the two last Greece bailout plans. Germany is indeed the highest contributor of the eurozone and accounts for 29% of those plans, having spent 46 billion euros, with another 21 billions to go.

&gt;But everyone also seems to forget that the Greek crisis caused a general distrust towards the eurozone which resulted in a trend of ""fly to quality"" : high demand of German debt. As a result Germany can borrow money at a rate of 0%. Even more the two-years bond rate on the secondary market is (in the beginning of June) negative, meaning investors accept to lose money so as to secure their capital, as if they were renting a safe in a bank.

&gt;An approximative* calculation shows that, thanks to this, Germany earned 63 billion euros in three years.  6-years bonds' rates - the most common- have indeed shrank from 2.6% in 2009 to 0.95% in 2012. Germany has already cashed back its Greek investment. 

&gt;According to the same calculations France -whose 6-years bonds' rate have gone from 2.91% in 2009 to 1.97% this year- has earned back 80% of what it lent to Greece: 38 billions in *vs* 48 out (of which 33 billions have already been paid).

&gt;Nevertheless, Germany and France are not only helping Greece, but also Ireland, Portugal, and soon, through the European Financial Stability Facility, Spanish banks.

&gt;*Hypothesis: 2200 billion euros of debt pool for Germany, 2000 for France, renewed every 6 years.


tl;dr : what Germany lent to Greece, it earned it back with lower debt rates (which are caused by people wanting to secure their money out of Greece into Germany).",0,1340482192,null,0,1340483822,0,c54m9vf,t3_vhhf2,t1_c54m9vf,t3_vhhf2,null,1429213128,23,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,23

&gt; He doesn't ""technically"" have entitlement to welfare, he has entitlement to welfare and can sue if it's denied. No matter where he got his passport, he's a German citizen and therefore has the same rights as a German citizen who has been living in Germany his entire life.

true,N_Sharma,null,null,"These calculations do not take in account the damage to the general economy. I'll just talk about the French case, given that I don't know enough about Germany. Let's just start with a shocking figure : French debt. 600 billions more than at the start of the crisis, and now a whooping 1700 billions of government debt.

France lost far more than a few dozen of billions in that crisis : INSEE (the French governement statistical institute) has computed a range of estimate of how costly was the crisis for France.

They have estimated that the crisis costed 140 billions € per year to the French economy, including 70 billions/per year in taxes for the government since 2009, so that is 210 billions loss in 2009-2011 for the government. Where were the other 400 billions wasted, only Sarkozy know. And I'm afraid that the figures for the two years to come won't really get better.

France manufacturing ability is also below 2008 level.

The Court of Audit of France (Cour des Comptes) has actually different figures (still in the hundred of billions) but because it is a bipartisan respectable institution, they have to stay neutral and only release figures year per year. They did not release any kind of reports or any kind of summary about the whole crisis so far. Some journalists analyzed those reports and came up with a 120 billions € cost for the government, but I'm not sure if their analysis is any good.

Anyway, those figures kind of make Germany and France look stupid, given that Greece initial debt was ""only"" 300 billions € at the start of the crisis, and since then their gdp is shrinking fast and it's impossible for them to reimburse without defaulting almost all of it. The best case scenario is now a 2020 estimate of 100 % GDP debt ratio with a default of half the debt. That is what was promised to the investors. But they won't see their cash.

Three years ago, we were already talking about the same issues , about how Greece was a lost cause, Spain a bubble that would burst, Italy a possible weak link.

Der Spieß war andersrum, die Bürger wussten vor den Politikern Bescheid und konnten/haben diese Chance ausgenutz etwas sinnloses im Keim zu ersticken.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hola, te doy mi versión:

- ¿Sería mejor vivir solo o con una familia de la region en cual viviré?

Cada cosa tiene sus ventajas. Vivir con una familia te puede parecer muy interesante (estarás muy integrado!) pero al mismo tiempo quizá aprecias estar de manera más independiente. Por ejemplo, en grandes ciudades es muy fácil encontrar habitaciones para alquilar en pisos compartidos. 

- ¿Hay ciudades en cuales podría vivir fácilmente yo?

Depende de qué tipo de ciudades te gusten. Creo que cualquier ciudad de tamaño medio puede ofrecerte alojamiento razonable. Otra cosa es que si te gusta salir por la noche, ir a conciertos, etc... en una ciudad no capital, hay muy poca oferta. Yo vivo en Tarragona, a 100km de Barcelona. Es una ciudad de tamaño medio, pero la oferta cultural es muy pequeña.

- ¿Son simpaticos los nativos a los extranjeros (esp. Americanos)?

A los extranjeros en general, no mucho (hay bastante xenofobia con ciertas nacionalidades) pero con los estadounidenses no hay problema. Supongo que ocurre igual en EE.UU, no se percibe igual un extranjero mexicano, de guatemala o de china, que un canadiense, un francés, un alemán...

- ¿Es caro vivir en una ciudad española?

Puede ser caro, pero también puede ser barato. Depende del tipo de nivel de vida que quieras llevar. Yo creo que si buscas bien, puede ser razonable.


- ¿Qué sería mejor hacer con respeto al transporte: autobús, bicicleta, coche, o algo diferente?

Depende de la ciudad. Si es una gran capital: transporte público. El precio del combustible para el coche es un robo, así que es mejor intentar evitarlo. La bicicleta puede ser una buena idea, pero recuerda que en España no es un medio de transporte tan popular como en otros países de Europa del norte. Muchos conductores de coche son muy despreocupados con las bicicletas. Yo cuando voy en bicicleta por la carretera, no me siento seguro...

It's funny because I used to be praising the German media for dealing with all sorts of issues and being much less shallow and right-wing than the Dutch media (actually, that still might be true), having intellectuals debate politicians on tv etc. But now with the eurocrisis there's barely any public dissent except from perhaps die Linke.

We're talking about some pretty complex issues here. Just yesterday I've heard a report about a study that came to the conclusion that, while general levels of education were on the rise, almost one in five (!) of German 15-year-olds lack the ability to properly comprehend written text. Not articles about economics or the like, just normal text. And even among those who have the abilities and education to understand the issues, not everybody is interested, and among those who are, there's disagreement.

The point is, this misguided and ignorant welder is far from alone. He lost his job, and this picturesque city at the East German Baltic coast has been having problems with unemployment for along time. That's why the Guardian went there and not to, say, Munich. Now a populist has released a book that seems to confirm what he probably had suspected all along.

&gt; If your books and newspapers tell you this was caused by 55 years of age retirements and Mediterranean laziness and you lack the knowledge and critical thinking to realize this is completely false, you're an idiot.

Sure, but many people actually *are* [idiots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiot#Etymology), either because they don't try to get informed or because they lack the necessary intelligence or education to distinguish between objective reports and populism, and their vote counts just as much as yours or mine.  
Journalists aren't always correct, either. Take this report, for example. Freie Wähler isn't an anti-euro group, they're not even a normal political party. They have their common body, but are mainly active on the municipal level and driven by very local issues. They've been around since forever, since long before the euro. That German media constantly portraits Greeks as corrupt and lazy has almost become a stereotype itself. There were some articles like that early on in the crisis, notably [this one](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de%2Ftexte%2Fanzeigen%2F32559&amp;act=url), and of course they have a lasting effect. This is hardly a topic anymore, though, with the exception of Bild. It's the same as when you read articles about Greek media portraying Germans as Nazis. It does happen, you'll find examples, but they have other things to write about.

I can read Greek, you can't just send a link and make me go away. This is just the day to day activities of the police and it only reports solved cases. So, there's probably no data on immigrants reporting being attacked. And there's also no statistical analysis of how the frequency of these attacks evolve over time.

Even if someone were to make a statistical analysis on that data, how reliable is the police on this matter really? We have always suspected that a lot of people there are fascists and now there's even some evidence supporting that they voted for GD en mass. 

&gt; On the contrary, right-wing newspapers are a joke and the most influential journalists lean to the Left, that's why they'll increase their efforts to report anything against the new ""establishment"".

While I agree that a lot of the more influential journalists lean to the left, I very much disagree with your ""liberal media conspiracy"". The media as a whole clearly caters to the needs of their owners. Do you really think rich businessmen constantly bail out corporations that fail to make them any money and then these corporations discredit the capitalist system and the rich? It's pretty shocking that you seem to imply that.

&gt; your ""liberal media conspiracy""

Search elsewhere for conspiracy theorists. I could mention specific names if I wanted to.

&gt; The media as a whole clearly caters to the needs of their owners.

Exactly. But media groups in Greece became what they are because of the policies of specific left-wing parties. However, they don't care about Left or Right, they like to get things done. Dozens of MPs are dozens of MPs. They don't ignore them, they cater for their real or imaginary needs. In an imaginary country, X. could be a left-wing journalist (with a real penchant for conspiracy theories concerning immigrants, if I may say so), hired by a left-wing editor of a (namely) right-wing newspaper. This person is also P.'s relative, while P. is an influential member of a large party. Also, G. could be another journalist that was caught stealing movie scripts, and presenting them as real stories about immigrants. That's as far as we'll go into these imaginary stories, today.

&gt; there are some sources that offer aggregate information instead of isolated inscidents

Ombudsman didn't use hard data from the Police, but she relied on newspaper reports. If you use 500 words to report on a incident, instead of the 50 word column you used in the past, this doesn't multiply the total number of incidents by 10. As for the head of the Pakistani community, no need for a comment. His affiliations are known. Such a spectacular view to see his compatriots roaming around speeches, during the election season. If natives (voting) won't go, illegal immigrants (not voting) come to the rescue!

If you want to look deeper into that matter, without any preoccupations, you'll see that the number of cases of older immigrants attacking new immigrants increased. This is why they divide their territories for selling counterfeit goods, drugs, guns, and teenagers.

Example: the article mentions that there is a German media narrative of the ""lazy Southerners"", and then nonchalantly mentions in one breath **Bild** (Germany's biggest tabloid, on par with, say, the UK's Sun) and **Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung** (FAZ), a broadsheet quality newspaper, with a moderate conservative leaning. This attempt to pretend that all of the German media just keeps on bashing on the South is a joke -- the FAZ is highly critical of Eurobonds and other costly measures that they perceive as threatening to fiscal discipline, but they do **not** mindlessly repeat cliches about Spain or Greece, like Bild does.

Newspapers usually use a specifically coated paper to prevent fires in both the printing factory and during transport. I bet you had a hard time burning the **FAT HEADLINES** of your Bild newspaper. The colour gets a special treatment to prevent fires as well. I know that Axel Springers' [Publisher of Bild] premature conclusions have already ruined a few careers without really caring but the Bild is still better than having no widely read newspaper at all.  Bild taking political stance that mirrors the stance of Springer Board members is a given. If you don't agree, don't buy it. You basically advertised the Bild for free, any publicity is good publicity.

I don't like Bild as much either but if you spend some time working a hard job, doing manual labor you'll understand why Bild is so popular. Even I preferred the tits and outrageous headlines on page one as opposed to reading an in depth article in a magazine or book. I also think Bild has impressive printing presses which are a good and valuable asset for German economy.

That does not include the present-day provinces of Liège, Namur and Limburg to start with.

We're partly lost in translation and I really should expand more. Since you follow my previous comments, you must know by now that I'm accusing the Greek government about its serious mistakes. On the other hand, while Germany benefited from the crisis, it's not doing good *only* because of the crisis. Germany took strict measures in the past years, which also had an impact on Germany's social fabric. But now, with the crisis unfolding for a full three years, the plight of other states benefits Germany more and more. I do understand Germany's frustration, because Germany feels others envy its success. But the success story is much more complicated and the German government isn't telling the whole truth.

[Objectives of the EU](http://en.euabc.com/word/743)

&gt;My vote in Slovak parliament has much more voting power than my vote in european parliament. Simply because the number of voters is much less.

If that's the only reason why you support Slovakia more than you support the EU, then I suppose you also propose the breaking up of Slovakia into [8 regions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Slovakia) independent from each other. Even better, how about [79 districts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Slovakia), all of them fully independent? Surely then your voting power would be much stronger than it is right now, right?

&gt;Its not irrational. Centralisation always brings in higher threat of abuse of power, and politicians that try to appease very different groups of people, effectively satisfying noone.

That's only if you give them full power. The only power they need is the one that's relevant to the whole unions, they'd still be left far away from local government and would still have to answer to the leaders of each member-state. Please don't confuse further union with an autocracy, it's ridiculous.

&gt;More power to the states could be a bad thing there only because some of them have a lot of backwards religious conservatives.

Previously you said you wanted your vote to matter much more... I'm going to play the devil's advocate here and ask you if you only support democratic choice when you agree with what the polls show. Because that's not really supporting democracy, that's supporting only your own opinions and then legitimizing it with the popular vote.

Wording things differently, for example, if Slovakia was a backward religious conservative country and the rest of the EU wasn't, would you support the EU because you think it would try to suppress the Slovak public opinion which was different from yours?

&gt;We have no such thing here, so there is no problem with being decentralised.

The whole issue isn't about there being problems with being decentralized, we've always been independent from each other and we came out fine, those who didn't die along the way, that is. It's that united, we're much stronger.

&gt;It's a flawed concept that will only survive if we're willing to make changes to it that will vastly reduce the benefits for Germany and other productive countries.

You're missing the mark in your analysis: Germany is not mainly more productive *because* they receive(d) benefits from joining the EZ, and there are several respected calculations (or rather: estimations) that show this. Did Germany receive *some* benefit from joining? Yes. Did the other countries receive benefits as well (in the form of lower borrowing rates)? Absolutely yes! It has been said on this subreddit over and over again: 

a) Germany didn't really want the Euro in the beginning (it was a bargain between France and the rest of the EU and Germany, as a precondition for the German unification), so there goes the theory that Germany had it planned all along to suck the rest of Europe dry, and

b) it's not Germany's fault that various countries used the new, (presumably undeserved) superlow borrowing rates to either fund a huge housing bubble (Spain) or run up a fat, unsustainable deficit, combined with an unsustainable wage/productivity ratio (Greece).

It's in Germany's (and the other core countries) interest to help the rest of the Eurozone to get out of the mess we're all in now, but you really need to stop trying to pretend Germany was the main culprit for this mess. Once that point has been driven home, the discussion how to *solve* the problem can become much more open and less emotional -- but trust me on this: as long as some people still think Germany **owes** it to anybody to pay anything, we're not going to make any progress, trust me on that.

Our constitution is a living document and was never considered infallible or perfect by the authors.  They left the option to amend the constitution, and that used to be respected.

Realizing their mistake a few years later, they made another amendment getting rid of it.

* No more than one term can be served by an individual at any of the positions mentioned above
* Double-representation in important commissions (e.g. the EC). One representative elected by the country they represent, and one from a different country.
* Multitude of provisions for electronic governance (digital signing, e-voting, digital consent etc)
* Multitude of mechanisms to allow the people to induce debates in the EU Parliament (the only one we have now has only been launched recently and it is quite difficult to activate)
* Also: easy ways to set up electronic referendums and if the participation is higher than, say 30%, then the result must be followed by the Parliament
* Population groups as constituents of the parliament seats. E.g. some MEPs will only be elected by young people, others by women only etc. 
* Alternative to the above: lawyers as advocates of the groups with the right to address the parliament. e.g. the advocate of the children will be debating the long-term influence of a new policy in Education
* Unified tax system with digital wallet as I have explained [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/vbp9h/commission_mulls_fiscal_ids_to_stop_tax_evasion/c5354b2)
* Good financial reimbursement for elected members (up to a couple of millions for the 6 years term) but that will not be certain. It will go on a pot and will only be available, say, ten years after their service finishes. They will lose this if their work is proven inefficient or corrupted. A 'jury' of randomly selected normal people would review their work after the 10 years have elapsed and decide on the amount of financial reimbursement. This will be repeated every 10 years until the death of the politician and his first-degree relatives (wife(s), children, siblings, parents). Also, with the help of the digital wallet, all their transactions of their life will be available to the jury. Any of the regular juries will have the right to refer the politician to a court
* Corrupt politicians to be tried for treason, with life imprisonment without parole as a potential sentence.
* No direct and unregulated public funding of election campaigns. All candidates and their pitches, CV, etc will be listed in a single web site, run by the EU, which will allow easy comparison between candidates and attempt equal representation of everyone.

I mean, the Dutch government is probably even worse and more obstructive in actually fixing the eurocrisis, but it's a small country and therefore doesn't get as much attention.

- 2 GB of data costs $30

- You can get a minimum of 500 minutes a month for $40

- You MUST get a phone to receive this rate, therefore signing a 2 year contract

- You MUST get data for your phone just because your phone is capable of handling it

- You will be charged both incoming and outgoing minutes and texts at the same rate

- We cannot guarantee you coverage.

This is what it currently is like in the US (and don't try to convince me otherwise, I lived in the US for nearly a decade).

The problem is, instead of another business (i.e. another carrier) recognizing this problem, they just decided to go along with it. Why? Because they can. Because they all do it. 

The result is that you pay $70 a month for shitty coverage, 250 minutes , 250 texts (500/2 since you pay for incoming too), and 2 GB of data and are stuck with them for 2 years, while I (in Europe) pay 7.5 EUR per month (so ~$10) for no-commitment, 1500 minutes (outgoing only), 1500 texts (outgoing only), and unlimited internet (truly unlimited).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; That does not include the present-day provinces of Liège, Namur and Limburg to start with. Furthermore, in practice having the same monarch in a personal union did not entail much more than an occasional meeting in Brussels, Mechelen or wherever the Habsburgian regent preferred to reside. It had no particular influence on the lives of 99% of the people who continued to live their lives as they did before, focused on their regional connections. As a result, there's very little culture that can be called Belgian.

That doesn't really include Liège, granted. Namur and Limburg it did. Now, I never meant to say that a mere personal union means we have been 'one' since centuries ago. But a personal union, or a 'Kreitz' in the Holy Roman Empire, can be a great facilitator for a common culture. Besides, denying our common political heritage in favour of regional politics would more likely strengthen cross language bindings, apparent in the bilingual counties of Brabant, Liege and to lesser extent, thanks to the barbaric Louis XIV, Flanders.

In any case, the historical cultural bonds we have between these 17 provinces are a fact. You might have heard about the Leo Belgicus maps that prove a perceived common culture since the 16th century and include what we would now call the Benelux plus Nord-Pas de Calais. Remind you that these were drawn after the Northern Dutch independence.

Then we had another quarter millenium of Southern Netherlands under the Austrians. These provinces knew their own Belgian revolution against a rather autocratic emperor and at the same time the Liège Revolution occured against an autocratic Prince Bishopric. Contrary to what BDW likes to say, the Flemish people are in fact a rather revolutionary people after all. The Dutch Revolution and it's previous attempt were twice instigated by the states of Brabant, and the only reason we aren't 'Dutch' right now is because we're closer to Spain.

Was there ever anything as a Belgian culture? Maybe not, but there was a culture of the Southern Netherlands. And while I do think the Belgian secession was a mistake, not the revolution. Because it was directed against an autocratic monarch.

&gt; It would be far preferable to this situation, but as it stands French speaking Belgium wouldn't allow it because their advantageous position would be gone. They look to France for their culture anyway, completely submitting to their big brother will come naturally.

Elite can be replaced. I don't believe the Wallonian people care about their advantageous position. They just want to be treated equally and we should support the economic development of their poorer regions, as long as we know were our money goes. If they do wanted to be treated better than us , they can go to France and their provinces can become the 102nd to 105th département.",0,1340565380,null,0,1340565592,0,c54yxmy,t3_vg5an,t1_c54yxmy,t1_c54ww3z,null,1429219257,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
