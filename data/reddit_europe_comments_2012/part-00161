&gt;Numerous examples are available for illustration, but the destruction of the space shuttle Challenger as well as the 9/11 attacks are obvious examples. In the case of the space shuttle, the fault that destroyed the vehicle was attributed to a faulty rubber ""o-ring"" on one of the shuttle's solid fuel boosters. After the tragedy, investigators found that this fault was reported as a potential problem, but ignored. Those affected by hindsight bias view this as practically criminal, as the fault was known long before the event, but they completely ignore the hundreds, if not thousands, of other reports that had the same probability of causing the destruction of the shuttle. In relation to the attacks on the World Trade Centre, several reports of ""something big"" were milling around intelligence agencies, however, prior to the attack itself there were many reports of ""something big"", many of which led to nothing. Any assessment of how people react to information or intelligence regarding a potential event, should be done without the benefit of the knowledge that the event actually happened.

&gt;One way to deal with such “asymmetric” shocks is for capital and labour to move out of a depressed region (Portugal, say) and into a flourishing one (Finland). Another is for wages—and thus prices—to fall in Portugal and rise in Finland, boosting the demand for Portuguese products at the expense of Finnish ones.
&gt;
&gt;Another response is to make transfers from regions doing well to those doing badly—either through governments or through individuals earning returns on foreign assets. But if the effects of shocks persist, fiscal transfers merely delay the day of reckoning; ultimately, wages or people (or both) must shift.
&gt;
&gt;The United States has a single currency, but it may not be an optimal currency area. There are asymmetric shocks—recall New England's recession in the mid-1980s when the rest of America was booming. But Americans readily move to where the jobs have shifted, even if this means crossing state lines. And the federal government also makes stabilising resource transfers: according to one 1980s estimate, up to 40% of any fall in gross state product is offset by higher spending by, and lower taxes paid to, the federal government.
&gt;
&gt;The euro-zone does not remotely resemble an optimum currency area. Asymmetric shocks have been frequent. Some, such as Germany's reunification, are huge. And adjustment is painfully slow. Wages in the EU are notoriously inflexible. Europeans are loth to up sticks within their own country, let alone moving abroad. They hold few foreign assets. EU-wide fiscal transfers are small—and increasing them, when the Germans and Dutch are already complaining about their net EU budget contributions, would be hard.
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt;A different way of smoothing divergent business cycles would be to increase EU-wide fiscal transfers. To get the biggest bang for its euro, Brussels could spend any increased tax revenue on cyclical spending, such as unemployment benefit. Then if Spain were booming while Germany was in recession, Brussels would, in effect, tax Spanish workers to pay Germans' unemployment benefit, limiting Spanish growth and stimulating Germany's. But imagine selling a scheme like this to the Spanish government.",0,1353085549,null,0,1353085870,0,c72cne7,t3_1399b3,t1_c72cne7,t1_c72actc,null,1430423118,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Someone explained it very well a few days ago, so I saved the comment:

&gt;Austerity is the only option left. What do you want European governments to do? They failed hard by spending insane amounts of money. I'm all for social programs, but when government spending makes up as much of your economy as it did in Greece, or when your government directly employs a huge margin of the workforce, you have a problem. There is no way in hell they could gain enough revenue through taxation - even if they taxed the rich 100%, it still wouldn't be enough - so they borrowed to finance their spending. Now nobody wants to lend to them. What the fuck are they going to do? They can't ""make money"" - they are Euro members. They have little monetary control. The ECB isn't going to rapidly inflate the Euro because that would piss off all the Germans, Dutch, etc who saved their money.
Politicians make their career based on being reelected, and austerity is electoral suicide. Just ask Sarkozy. No politician wants to do austerity - they have been forced to do it by economic conditions.
Let's remember that Germany and plenty other nations maintained solid spending, social services, and safety nets whilst keeping a good credit score by being prudent and trustworthy. And Germany managed to do this whilst dealing with a huge influx of relatively poor citizens after East Germany was absorbed by the West. The leaders of Greece, Spain, and Portugal were fucking up big time during the boom years, yet there were no vast marches on the streets protesting corruption and waste back then.
Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, etc can maintain high levels of spending - very high - because they have the trust of lenders. This is why talk of the need to drastically cut spending during a recession in the US is stupid - everybody wants our bonds. If Greece and whatnot try the whole ""let's default"" option, they will lose that trust pretty quickly - or at least, whatever trust remains.",0,1353086093,null,0,false,0,c72csvh,t3_1399b3,t1_c72csvh,t1_c728r72,null,1430423186,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,Dr_Gage,null,null,"I'm not very sure what you mean by ""Americanisms"". So I'll try to give general advise. 

For my experience American table manners are a little different that Spanish. I'm going to give a list, some are more formal than others and I'm sure we share some of them. 

You should not rest your hand on your lap, your napkin goes on your lap, not on the table. If you are going to serve yourself water or wine make sure you serve others first, also your hand should be [facing downwards when you do this](http://www.cocina.org/wp-content/uploads/servir-el-vino.jpg). You usually wait for the oldest person on the table to start eating to start yourself. Something that surprised me when in USA is that a lot of people don't use cutlery properly (or how we do) just look and copy.

Try every food they offer you, Galicia in my opinion has the best food in Spain, everything (vegetables, meat, fish, seashells...) is just of such high quality. Some foods may be strange to you like octopus or lamprey but you should try them before you can say you don't like them.

For my experience galician grandmas are about the nicest people ever, they will try to make you eat till you feel sick, that's going to be a battle of it's own to not die eating.

Apart from the food aspect just keep the general advise ""Haya donde fueras haz lo que vieras"" (wherever you go do as you see) and you'll be fine.

As to politics, some people are nationalistic and some aren't. You are a foreigner so that puts you in a position where you can just ask without people assuming you have a political stance on the matter. 

Alcohol; in Spain we have a very social approach to alcohol,  not just getting wasted. It's perfectly acceptable to have a beer at 12am and we usually eat at the same time we drink. If you are going to a rural area you'll probably surprised at how much older men drink, just don't point it out. Try [Alvarinho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albari%C3%B1o), it's wonderful and I love licor cafe and orujo, strong alcoholic drinks(50% and up) that you usually drink a shot after a meal, sips, not shots as in all the glass at once.

Some traditions are celt and they depend a lot on the region of galicia you are. 

Very little people speak English, you should learn how to say ""I don't speak spanish/galician, do you speak english?"" both in spanish and galician.

And that's about all I can think of, just enjoy and take a good rain coat, you'll need it.

If you define what you mean by Americanisms I'm sure people will help you better.  ",0,1353087716,null,0,false,0,c72d9fl,t3_139oqp,t1_c72d9fl,t3_139oqp,null,1430423400,5,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,5

Also, don't eat lunch at noon and dinner at 5:30. Typically, meals are later, and stacked in the middle of the day.

Even if your Spanish isn't very good, give it a shot, rather than defaulting to &lt;&lt;Habla usted ingles?&gt;&gt;.

Just talk, and probably even if you're off on tenses or genders, you can make yourself understood. It's a really good way to train yourself.

Immersion is really the idea here, so if you can, try to avoid eating at American restaurants. You can go back and have Subway or Burger King all you want, but you're in Spain, so don't! Have a real meal, it will be better, cheaper, and much healthier.

But you don't have to be one to realize what would happen to Greece after a default. 
Look at Argentine and keep in mind that they have natural resources other people wanted. Greece don't have that. 

They need to import their energy, which would be quite hard considering they wouldn't have access to the capital markets and noone would probably accept their drachmas as a payment. 
Afaik Greece also has to import food, which will also become hard after a default.

Not mentioning that their savings and salaries would become close to worthless. 
 
Lots of debt is also owned by the Greeks themself, you really don't have to be a scientist to realize that it would also hurt the corporations in Greece, which could lead to even more people unemployed.


Maybe you will realize that ""our tax money"" does help them. We are not fixing their problems, but we buy them time to fix their problems on their own. I don't know if it will succeed, since it is not in our control. But Germany cannot fix the problems, only the Greeks can fix Greece.

So basically what you're saying is ""There's no such thing (except when there is)""

Militarily often use civilian devastation for demoralizing or bludgeoning the enemy. And/Or (as is also in this case) for revenge. In fact it is our civilization's biggest achievement that we finally started holding militay murderers accountable. This wasn't the case before the 1850s. And it's always the same thing.

&gt; Militarily often use civilian devastation for demoralizing or bludgeoning the enemy. And/Or (as is also in this case) for revenge. ...  They just let soldiers loose like wild animals on the civilians and then hide behind the ""no official order"" bullshit. I

but the mere lack of orders isn't what aquitted him of the charge - rather, he was freed of charges of either targeting civilians - 'exactly of the charge of civilian devastation for demoralizing or bludgeoning the enemy' - by artillery fire, targets he chose, how he targeted the blows - AND of the charge of not doing enough to prevent or punish his subordinates (aiding and abetting and also superior responsibility) - so again EXACTLY of your second charge of just ""let soldiers loose like wild animals on the civilians a""

&gt; Can't call someone who this or the other way had civilian death under his command a hero

again, if you mean, as in say, using artillery to achieve military goals, knowing that its bound to cause some civilian to die at some point (btw THAT was my caveat about collateral damage - civilians unintentionally killed in any military action), rather than actually trying to intimidate civilians - then surely a military hero never existed. You've essentially banned warfare, or at the very least heavy weaponry like artillery.

If you mean, targeting civilians, well then Gotovina was, (this is getting repetitive) just acquitted of the charges of ever doing so. 

He could still be guilty ofc (which is why I wouldn't easily consider him a hero) - but lacking evidence, he should be presumed innocent.

There is absolutely no point in giving money if the old system and its flaws aren't remedied first. Greece's access to money has not been governed by an objective evaluation of Greece, but by its membership in the EU. The ""have your cake and eat it, too"" mentality, i. e. spend more and collect less since borrowing is cheap, has gotten them to where they are now. A Marshall Plan, exectuted now, would never reach those who work hard for fair wages and pay their taxes. It would be siphoned off into some well-connected pockets and only a trickle would arrive where it would do some good. Fix the sieve to make it at least a little bit like a bowl, then pour.

If the Greeks think the implemented austerity measures are hard, how hard would it be if the government had no money at all to spend all of a sudden? 

One more thing: many Germans pout when told about the bail-out funds being paid to Greece. Seeing themselves draped in swastikas in the Greece media is less than helpful.

For relatively richer countries, austerity can be succesful as it lowers the cost of work and makes you competitive and more people buy your things. However in Greece, the cost of labour goes down *however* less people buy your things because Greek people are too poor to buy things, and your products are not competitive on an international level because they are not as specialized as things say Germany or Netherlands can produce..

Because Serbia invaded and oppressed its neighbors for about a decade.

War crimes and crimes against humanity must *always* be persecuted and punished. Of course this includes crimes against Serbians.

But Serbia as a nation has *very* little credibility in whining about any other nation's conduct. Of all the nations in Europe, most of us have moved far beyond petty disagreements about territory, with the exception of the Balkans, and *in particular* Serbia, which on top of its complete mismanagement of its national economy and society in general also has an enormous persecution complex, due to being stuck with too much national pride to acknowledge its own (gigantic) faults and prior mistakes.",0,1353100131,null,0,false,0,c72gu3z,t3_13aiqk,t1_c72gu3z,t1_c72fp4m,null,1430425054,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

That's what caused the 2008 crisis, which worsened the economic situation and in turn suddenly made the structural deficits unsustainable. But this wouldn't have happened if those countries were more responsible and didn't rely on foreign borrowing so much. Look at my country, Poland, for an example of what happened if you were more responsible. 

The crisis just exposed the vulnerability of countries which were borrowing too much because they were spending too much. And crises happen - if it wasn't this one, it would be something else down the road, and the problem would be exposed sooner or later with similar results. That's why it's not the financial sector that holds the fundamental blame.

It really has nothing to do with religion as such. The religions just correlate to the two groups - republicans/nationalists (Irish Catholic) and Unionists/loyalists (British Protestant).

They are not fighting because one group believes the Virgin Mary really did ascend into heaven and that women shouldn't be priests and the other group doesn't, they are fighting because one group wants Northern Ireland to be belong to Ireland and the other wants it to belong to the United Kingdom. Religion is just an easy indicator to determine which side they are on.

true,shylence,null,null,"Sighh... Ulster was the most resistant part of Ireland up to the mid 1600s.  The Gaelic chiefs and their clanns still had control of the north West.   So once they were defeated the English and subsequent union of the Scottish and English kingdom: the United kingdom, set about on a policy of large scale large confiscation and clearance and  settlement of this finally subdued region with  mainly families from the troublesome border region between England and Scotland. ( look up border reivers)  

some Irish were killed of course, many others just simply fled into the mountains and forests and bogs, slowly they came back down again as these new plantations were not massively attractive to settlers. So the planters who had now confiscated and owned the land ended up in employing or using the former owners of the land to toil it for them in some parts of Ulster.  Up in the mountains though and the more stubborn soils you would still get majority Irish there, just subdued. That's why in the hills of Antrim up in the far north east of Ireland there is a majority nationalist area, but west along the river Bann it is mainly unionist.   

attempts were made to get these Irish to learn English and  take on the new religion, it was brief. Racist views on all sides meant it didn't happen, you need to understand it as kind of an apartheid state.  

Some Irish might have converted but this probably would have been in the 18th and 19th centuries as with the influx of the potato to Irish soil led to a massive increase in population -  It is all about the land my friend. If you converted, under the penal law system to protestantism AKA become more 'British' than Irish then you could own land. some did others did not. 

Over time there is  intermingling which is why  you have Gerry Adams as a leader of  Sinn fein and a commander of the IRA with a English surname and somebody like Neil Docherty who was a member of the UVF who helped to plant bombs in the late 60's  who is a protestant with an Gaelic surname. 

the root cause is not religion. Religion was used as a more simplistic understanding to how this ulster and the rest of Ireland was run.  English and Scots ruling over Irish. Just that each ethnic group also had a different religion. 

It is ethnicity and who owns the land, that is the root cause! stop fucking about with semantics, redem!

You probably mean what went on in Eastern Europe. Only minority parties (like really small parties) demand that (a return to the old eastern Europe as it was). I doubt they have more than 10 people. 

Most European parties (even hardcore left) are social democrats. Even the most hardcore communist parties in Europe accept the fact that there were lot's of mistakes and fuck ups in the Eastern Block. 

&gt;While your grandparents and parents lived after Second World War in prosperity with plenty of food and opportunities

You must be fucking kidding me. My grandparents went through a civil war and a dictatorship (both after WWII) and another mini-war (in Cyprus), and died practically the minute they got their pension.  

&gt;  If socialism was established in the whole world, there would be no people as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and many more who could take their chances and become successful, since in socialism success is punished

How can I live with this ? A world without Gates ? Quelle Catastrophe!

&gt; If we want to progress and if we really want to use opportunities which are given to as by nature, we cannot choose the way where someone else will make our decisions and future, that is something that socialism does

These are what dictatorships do, and some corporate players are so big now they are effectively market dictatorships. 

&gt;It might be hard to accept, but it is you and your parents who are responsible for your government.

How come ? We never voted for them.

This would have been a relevant piece to run 20-30 years ago.
Though not being able to read the language I can't determine what the article is actually about.

The areas of Belfast lower on the socioeconomic index have a much higher number of murals, however many of the old UVF/UDA/UFF murals have been removed or painted over with ones depicting more positive aspects of out history, at least in the last 10-15 years.

There are very few major loyalist paramilitary murals left around East Belfast these days, and even the loyalist enclave of Sandy Row has recently painted over it's paramilitary mural with a significantly less threatening one.

The divisions are still there, our political system is more slanted towards the extremes, with Sinn Fein and the DUP having gained most of the votes that used to be given to the more moderate UUP and SDLP, but that's because those fringe parties have themselves become more moderate with the advent of power sharing following the good friday agreement.

Most people that turn up to voite still vote down Unionist/Nationalist lines, this has lead to a much more socially conservative government thanks to the major unionist political parties having strong ties to funamentalist protestant churches and the Nationalist parties usually following the social policies of the catholic church. This has lead to Northern Ireland being significantly behind the rest of UK in terms of Abortion law and the like, as both sides have similarly conservative social views.

&gt;On May 29, 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act (Pub.L. 109-228), prohibiting protests within 300 feet (91 m) of the entrance of any cemetery under control of the National Cemetery Administration from 60 minutes before to 60 minutes after a funeral. Penalties for violating the act are up to $100,000 in fines and up to one year imprisonment. The bill garnered overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress with a 408–3 vote in the House, with 21 not voting, and a unanimous vote in the Senate.

And since we are talking about Belfast, which is in the UK:

&gt;On February 18, 2009, two days before the intended picket date, the **Home Office announced that Fred Phelps and Shirley Phelps-Roper would be specifically excluded from entering the UK** for having ""engaged in unacceptable behaviour by inciting hatred against a number of communities"", and that ""other church members could also be flagged and stopped if they tried to enter Britain"".

&gt;An alliance of six UK religious groups (the Baptist Union of Great Britain, Evangelical Alliance UK, Faithworks, Methodist Church of Great Britain, United Reformed Church and Bible Society-funded thinktank Theos) made a joint statement on February 19, 2009 in support of the government's decision and condemning the activities of the Westboro Baptist Church ",0,1353160672,null,0,false,0,c72r7w4,t3_13bdiu,t1_c72r7w4,t1_c72r0v5,null,1430430024,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Any place where whores post their services such as craigslist, before that they banned it. 

Not only do most of the males whores advertise for other men either exclusively or on addition to females, exclusively m4f rentboys tend to be the least successful i.e they have the lowest ratings, the least experience and the least longevity in terms of ads reposting. 

How many rentboy.com knock-off sites are there? A lot. How many cater to a female clientele? Not many. Certainly none as successful as rentboy.com itself. 

&gt;From what I could find through a quick Google search, male strip clubs in London cater to women primarily and gay men as well (many of them have ""Hen Nights"" or ""Hen Weekends"" exclusively for women).

There's two relevant result in if you search ""male strippers London""; the dreammen site and an event company that caters to both sexes. Not one single strip club from what I saw. 

If you search for gay stripper or such, you get a bunch of links to gay strip clubs and gay clubs with strippers.

Frankly, I think most people are of the opinion that unless you live there yourself, you have no right to decide what happens with it. I'm fully aware of Kosovo's place in Serbian history, but times change, and jurisdiction does not change that history. Kosovo, including its people, has been changing continuously throughout the last 800 years, being conquered, reconquered, Christianised, Islamified, Rechristianised, and so on. Expecting a simple ""alright we're tired of your complaining so you can have it"" from the UN and EU would be massively naïve, because it would completely ignore the non-Serbian history and current configuration of the region.

You may feel that the Serbian love for Kosovo is based in ""national identity"", but the fact is that the region is very rich in natural resources. Any notion of national identity is most likely a construction founded on the desire to have access to those resources.

Lastly, there is *legitimate* fear that Serbia will commence another of its ethnic cleansings of the area if the international community leaves it to them. We all know that Albanian Kosovars form the *vast* majority of people in Kosovo (92%). Nobody trusts Serbia to treat those people respectably, because of two things: 1) Serbias recent history, and 2) the current dominance of a strongly xenophobic discourse in Serbia.

Yes, it's all my opinion. I came to Serbia with an open mind (not really understanding any of the previous conflicts), and the impression it left me with was pitiful. The country has so much potential, yet it's consistently fucking itself up again and again, and the only reason I can point to is national pride. You're too proud to fix your own mistakes.

Sadly true. This is why I am critical of parents to neglect to teach their child critical thinking, and instead opt to impose their own dogmatic views onto them. 

People in the 20th/21st century should not be suffering and dying because of conflict arising from theological differences of their ancestors centuries ago.

This is called backpedaling. My claim was that women do not use these services as often as men, the reasons are irrelevant to this conversation. Also, social pressure is a comparatively poor tool to curve sexual behavior in men so it if works for women then clearly it'd only strengthen my point. 

&gt;What a surprise…

It's not surprising at all but this is a pretty slimy red herring from you. The point was to illustrate the fact that stripper services catering to *gay men* were more numerous than those catering to women, specificity in this case is a good thing because without the ""gay"" label ""male stripper"" defaults to the standard sexuality. 

So stop being an intellectually dishonest cunt. 

---

The idea that female sexual desires/behaviors/etc are fundamentally different from men certainly seems to offend you. Very much like those ""gender is a social construct"" feminists were offended by the idea that our gender roles are an extension of our sex.

1) You are exagerrating

The word ghetto can have different meanings. When I use the word 'ghetto', it is used to describe a low income, high crime neighborhood. A Jew in Warsaw in 1940 might have a different definition of 'ghetto'. The link above even describes these differences. Therefore, comparing Detroit to Gaza is disingenuous. Does 'ghetto' simply mean a bad place to be? Once again, when someone says the US has the worst ghettos in the world, I assume we may not be sharing the meaning.

true,MadManWithTinFoil,BAVA,Bavaria,"&gt; either German wages need to rise

I fail to see how that would help Europe. 
We haven't lowered our wages in the last decade, because it sounded like fun. 
Our Economy had quite some troubles (you will probably remember the Sick man of Europe reports). 
Comparing it on a European level I would agree that there is room for an increase of German wages, but we live in a  globalized world and the world doesn't end at European borders anymore. 

It is true that our wages do increase for the first time in a decade, but they wont increase to a level other European Economies would need it.
Not that I am against earning more, but I still think that Germany would get problems. 
And Europe doesn't need another troubled Economy.

We probably come to a different conclusion because I don't see a healthy trade surplus in Europe. 
While it is true if you see it as a whole, I think it doesn't look that good if you look at the numbers separate for every country.
It has been a while since the last time I checked the numbers, but if I remember it correctly, the overall trade surplus looks healthy because it is carried by the economies who are still in a good shape. 
The article does mention that Germany accounts for more than 50% of the trade surplus. 
I don't think that this means other countries don't have a problem with competitiveness.

&gt; or there need to be fiscal transfers to the periphery

I don't think this will be possible in the current construct we call EU.
Voters in the north will not like such transfer and the Eurosceptism will grow amongst them.
While it is true that people in (especially) northern countries will lose money, and more and more are accepting it. There is absolutely no support for a permanent transfer of wealth in those countries.
And after all you are ask them for their money and as long as they wont support it, there is no chance to implement it.
It is the good old ""no taxation without representation"" thing.
And I don't see the EU becoming a federal report any time soon.


&gt;or perhaps simply a concerted stimulus within Europe

Yes that sounds like the most reasonable solution in the moment.
The reform seem to be to painfully and the crisis countries need some help during the reformation of their economies.
Though I would only be in favor of it, if it would be a also good investment.
Something the countries will profit in the long run. 
I don't think more roads or airports would help Spain for example.
I think that this is the part where we have problems.
European leaders have agreed on such a stimulus (thought it might be to small) but afaik they couldn't agree on how to spent it, but maybe I only missed the news about it.

&gt;Shell by shell, they argued it could not be demonstrated which particular attack by explosives caused which civilian to flee. The appeals chamber accepted the argument

No, they proved that they did not target civilians. This was proved by the evidence demonstrating where the artillery fire was targeted. This is a misrepresentation of the defense. 

&gt;The appeals chamber made a strange decision on the status of the joint criminal enterprise to forcibly expel the civilian population: they decided that their adoption of the Rodney King standard on shelling makes irrelevant the documentary evidence from the Brioni transcripts and the public statements of Franjo Tuđman that indicate that expulsion of the civilian population was a goal of the military operation.

Again, a total misrepresentation not only of the defense, but of the judgement itself. The appeals chamber decided that the transcripts and statements in question did not specifically refer to the civilian population, and were in fact referring to the Serbian military forces. 

They ruled that the ""evidence"" was incredibly circumstantial and rejected it as being unsubstantiated in the light of the actual evidence (artillery fire, direct statements).

&gt;It invalidates the distinction between military and civilian targets in the Hague and Geneva Conventions by finding that any target can be retrospectively defined as having been military.

Wholly and absolutely wrong. It makes it clear that if you don't attack civilians, and if you can prove that you did your best to avoid harming civilians, that you are entitled to defensive and even offensive actions against military forces that may be in the same region. Actions against a military force are not war crimes against a civilian population when the evidence indicates that every precautions possible were undertaken to avoid unnecessary civilian loss of life. 

This is a grotesque misunderstanding of the import of this decision.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; We probably come to a different conclusion because I don't see a healthy trade surplus in Europe. While it is true if you see it as a whole, I think it doesn't look that good if you look at the numbers separate for every country. It has been a while since the last time I checked the numbers, but if I remember it correctly, the overall trade surplus looks healthy because it is carried by the economies who are still in a good shape. The article does mention that Germany accounts for more than 50% of the trade surplus. I don't think that this means other countries don't have a problem with competitiveness.

I think this gets to the heart of the issue. The consequence of the single currency, in fact one of its purposes, is/was to approximately equalize wages across Europe. That means that wages rise in countries like Spain, which lose export competitiveness but become much more lucrative export markets for countries like Germany, who themselves become more export competitive, because their wages are restrained. So when we see, since the introduction of the Euro, exports falling in Spain, and rising in Germany, leading to these figures you refer to, that is to some extent a fundamental consequence of having a single currency. You can try to approximate the effects of being able to devalue individual national currencies, but it's going to be awkward. Even if periphery wages could now be reduced back to where they were, to recover lost competitiveness, every future shock localized in one country or another will require this sort of messy internal devaluation. The only way around that is having some other balancing mechanism in place, which would usually be done through increases in unemployment benefits and various such things, to funnel money to areas which are in recession.

&gt; Yes that sounds like the most reasonable solution in the moment. The reform seem to be to painfully and the crisis countries need some help during the reformation of their economies. Though I would only be in favor of it, if it would be a also good investment. Something the countries will profit in the long run. I don't think more roads or airports would help Spain for example. I think that this is the part where we have problems.

That's a good point, although I expect there's still plenty of infrastructure to fit with things like fibre-optics. Also, although it wouldn't exactly be traditional stimulus, it might actually be the case that money would be best spent in some countries by upgrading government computer systems and protocols. Apparently when the Greeks introduced an IT database which tracked pharmacy drug reimbursement, the costs fell enormously, because pharmacies could no longer double or twice charge the same pills. I know Greece was also previously given money by the EU to introduce an electronic land registry, with the money disappearing without fruit. Those sort of systems might improve the efficiency of an economy in much the same way as a motorway.",0,1353176633,null,0,1353189095,0,c72u1pd,t3_13cobs,t1_c72u1pd,t1_c72su5b,null,1430431451,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

The Unionists that organise this parade claim that it is part of the traditional parade route and always has been and that's why it takes place there. It's not like the entire parade is on the road or in a nationalist area though, only a small, maybe 50 yard, part of the parade is on the Ardoyne Road. They literally march out of The unionist area onto the Ardoyne Road, go a block down the road and then turn back in to the unionist area. Although their claims of tradition hold some truth and for that reason alone they can't be stopped I do personally believe and as I'm sure many other people in Northern Ireland do that it is done out of antagonism to a certain degree.

The US would much rather export LNG to Japan and Korea as the price for natural gas there is higher, hence more profit. Also, the new report from IEA that came out this past week predicts that the US will be energy independent in 2035, so I don't see the EU being forgotten. 

As far as network overloads go, that is precisely the reason that electricity generation won't move far from conventionals in the near future. It will require ridiculous amounts of investment to change the grids, and no country or company will want to incur those costs until the infrastructure totally deteriorates.

Europe and Russia have a good thing going, and there is more investment going on (see South Stream, Nord Stream) and the IEA sees increase in natural gas consumption in every scenario. Producers want to make money, and Europe certainly will be willing to pay it. China has a ton of coal and is investing a lot in Africa. It also imports nuclear technology from Russia. Iraq is also going to supply China with a lot of petrol. Europe imports most of its oil from Russia.

While Europe does want to lead the ""green revolution,"" right now it is too expensive and impractical. They are far ahead many other countries and they want to export their technology more than anything. Europe will be depending on outsiders for hydrocarbons for many, many years to come. It just needs to choose which ones. Right now Russia is winning that race and they have been a fairly reliable partner in the past, so they will most likely continue to be.

true,kinder_jaje,LIEC,Liechtenstein,"They (Russia) have not been a reliable partner. If you want I can look up the links, but all the articles have been published here at /r/europe in the past week. Let me make a list of points:

1. Russia is seen as an unreliable partner because on 2 occasions already it used its gas as a political weapon and Europe suffered because of it.

2. Russian gas is too expensive. They could get away with it so far but the EU has been searching for alternatives for years and the results are finally showing. In the past 2 years, the profit of Gasprom has been decreasing steadily.

3. The US doesn't want to use its own gas and oil, the strategy up till now has been to let other countries use up their resources and then when they're all spent, the US can sell their own oil at a premium. What the US wants is to be independent of foreign oil, meaning, they can't get blackmailed anymore. Once they achieve this, they won't care about the stability of Saudi Arabia (so much) anymore.

4. Europe is a leader in green technology.

Instead of spending resources on importing iPhones, cars (yes there are many European brands, but essentially they're all made in China, which means we're importing them) and other crap which we don't really need (we have the best railway system in the world, let's use it!), instead of spending money on that, let's invest into infrastructure. Like the wind turbines, which you said would cost a lot of money. Taxes and incentives should be made for building ecohomes, which would be self-sustainable. Already, these houses exist, for example they burn their own garbage during winter, and use no gas at all for heating, and during summer they use solar power for heating water! Imagine if all homes were built that way, then I guess a huge amount of gas consumption would be erased. There are even whole villages being built as we speak, that are made entirely of ecohouses. 

The construction business in Europe is in ruins because there's no need to build further houses, as most people already have a home and the overall population is shrinking. It would be wholly revitalizing to the industry if people started investing in ecovillages and ecohomes.

There are other solutions which would make Europe independent of external resources. I'm not an expert, I only know a few examples. However, Europe can and should become independent, and we should start creating an exporting plan till every country in the EU is in surplus.",0,1353188135,null,0,false,0,c72wmgb,t3_13cobs,t1_c72wmgb,t1_c72w5ds,null,1430432643,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,j_rex,UNSA,United States of America,"Simply put, what Europe *should* do is different from what it *will* do. If you are referring to 2005-6 and 2009 as examples as Russia using gas as a political tool you're only partially right. The 2006 crisis was not that bad, and 2009 is the only time there was significant suffering. Russia increased the price of gas to Ukraine and Ukraine was not happy, so Russia never stopped the export of gas, but only sent the required amount for European consumption. The EU was warned that the gas was going to be turned off, and the large consumers did not suffer since they had ample reserves. Bulgaria got it the worst. In order to avoid such crises Russia and EU member states have agreed to build alternative pipelines, the Nord Stream and the South Stream. This shows that there is no planned decrease in dependence of Russian gas.

Also, Russian gas is cheaper than any alternative Europe has. Much, much cheaper. Even at the current price. Gazprom's profits only decreased last quarter - and they gave back money in order to keep the EU happy and maintain is demand of Russian gas.

As far as the US goes, it's just trying to make money. Obviously it wants strategic reserves (all countries do) but in fact it is starting to use its own oil and gas (primarily gas) simply because it is much much cheaper. US natural gas is at ~$2 whereas European is ~$8-10 and Japanese is ~$10-12. No state really can ""blackmail"" the US. It's too large of a consumer and can easily purchase gas from many other oil producing entities, or increase the production of its own reserves - which its doing. The OPEC cartel is dysfunctional, so any argument about them increasing prices is moot.

The addition of the argument about construction and cars (Europe produces 1/3 of the world's cars - so some individual parts may be produced in China, but they are most assuredly assembled in EU) makes your argument seem a tad disjointed. My argument is whether it produces electronics, cars, food etc domestically, Europe will still need to import oil and gas and eventually solar energy - plain and simple. As good as an idea ""ecohomes"" are, they need to be produced on a large scale to be effective, and that is a very long way away. Coupled with lobbies from electricity producers and other energy producers, it's virtually impossible. Its a flaw of the system, even though it's a good idea. 

Look, I'm not disagreeing that the EU should become more independent in its energy sources, but the literature and current events show the opposite happening. I'm looking at this with a pragmatic and objective viewpoint.

I taught in Mallorca for two years and was in much the situation as you; I had intermediate Spanish at best, and was also concerned about fitting in. All the advice below is great advice, basically you just want to look at what people around you are doing and follow their lead and you'll fit right in. That said, don't be afraid to be yourself and share your culture. Share food from home that you've made (cookies, or whatever!), make some Spanish friends and get them american-style drunk, then teach them the meaning of the phrase 'puke and rally', celebrate the holidays that are important to you and share them with those around you. In my experience, Spanish people like American celebrations of holidays due to the large amounts of food and alcohol consumed.
You might consider the pros and cons of having Spanish roommates exclusively. After being immersed all day in a foreign culture, it is nice to come home to your native language and culture. That said, totally going native (up to and including a local boy/girlfriend) is probably the best way to improve your language skills in the shortest amount of time. I managed to not only perfect my spoken Spanish to a pretty high degree, but also to learn Catalan while I was in Mallorca. Ok, long and rambly

**tl;dr** Sound advice from everyone so far. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. That said, share the awesome parts of American culture with the locals. Food, drinks, binge drinking, absurd holiday cooking. Maybe you want to live with other english-speakers, maybe not; either way you'll learn a lot more Spanish by banging someone who speaks no English.

You're confusing the issue even more, UKIP only polls 8-10% when considering all domestic matters.  When it comes to the single issue of European elections it now appears they are the direction of the masses.  56% are saying they are starting to side with being anti-EU and not just scepiticism.

&gt;The undemocratic aspects I was talking about refer to the hypothetical scenario where Britain would opt for the Norwegian model. In this situation, democratic reform is irrelevant because Britain wouldn't be allowed to vote on these things anyway.

But that's reframing an argument that will never happen whoever wins, 

  If the conservatives win they advocate a two tier Europe and renegotiating a British model, not a Norwegian or Swiss model.  At the expense of sounding arrogant Britain does not adopt off the rail pre-cut solutions tailored with far smaller countries in mind.

  If UKIP wins they'll throw EU regulations in the UK out.  Simple as that.  When trading with them they'll just meet requirements like they would with anyone else...

...but hypothetically, and only only hypothetically, let's look at the Norwegian model for Britain in 2014 and how democratically things could get better or worse...


The argument made will be compelling.

        ""By 2014 QMV will be expanded under Lisbon so the British 
        vote would have been less 'authorative' had it stayed in.  
        Like the Norwegians they would have a say but not a vote 
        on free market and some health and safety/working regulation 
        and then it would be up to them how they interpret it giving 
        them lots of leeway and gray room for maneuverer.  In 
        return for this they get control of their farming, the trade
        agreements, fishing, a seat on the WTO and bring its 
        ultimate line of government closer to the people where 
        there'd be fewer constituents per elected official.""

...and then they'll add the kicker,

         ""As of 2014 where Britain, France and German all until 
          recently had an equal voice under the treaty of Nice, in
          future despite the UK being the largest net contributer per
          capita Germany will now have a bigger vote under the Lisbon
          Treaty...""

*that in itself will set people uneasy.  Then they'll add,*

           ""And under the new system Spain gets even more 
            of a say, and now the system has been changed
            so there doesn't have to be unanimous voting on 
            several matters for x to pass, now they only need
            a 55% majority so if we disagree more than we
            agree as it is then we'd still end up being dictated to 
            only without being able to set up our own trade, 
             farming and fishing and we wouldn't have a seat on 
             the WTO.""

At this point the Democracy Scales are looking decidedly in favour of getting the hell out.  Here comes the coup de grace they'll deliver,

              ""And the new system is based on population so 
               when south Med population centres continue to take
               over the UK the UK will become less relevant.  Not 
                more.  That's just where we are in 2014.  The 
                direction they're now saying is Federalism and much
                 much more of the same...""

Mention democracy anytime close to the 2014 European elections and they will win the masses in a swoop.  It'll be like Caesar driving Pompey out of Rome.  Will they do it with sensationalism?  Yes - but they are going to play the Lisbon Treaty voting reform and push for federalism card sooo hard.  Even hypothetically with some regulations being passed on which the UK would have to adopt in 'some manner or other' the net democratic gain in leaving even under the Norwegian model will be huge.

I really wouldn't mention the democracy angle, if I were you.

Partisan numbers from Serbia would be diminished until 1943 when the Partisan movement gained upswing by spreading the fight against the axis'' see not all Croats where ustasa, just like not all serbs where Chetniks, '' Croatian Partisans were integral to overall Yugoslav Partisans; by the end of 1943 Croatia proper, with 24% of the Yugoslav population, provided more Partisans than Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia and Macedonia combined which collectively accounted for 59% of the Yugoslav population.[28] The Croatian partisans were unique in that they had the highest numbers of local Jews in their ranks of any other European resistance'' But the Serbs would like the rest of the world to believe that all Croats are Nazi scum, and that every Croat loved Hitler. look at Stjepan Filipovic http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stjepan_Filipovi%C4%87. 

See the Serbs would like the rest of the world to believe that the Croats, are the bad guys, but Yugoslavia began to go bad when more Serbs with pro serbia idea's got power and used it in a way that was pro serbian and not pro yugoslavia, see Milosovic.

&gt;Microsoft didn't do anything wrong. You don't like what someone is selling? Don't buy it.

Not all people are capable of making all relevant distinctions; in this case it's not always clear to everyone that a web browser is something you *can* choose. There's also the issue of captive markets when the cost of switching between products is very large, not to mention that there aren't that many OS available at all. In addition a monoculture of browsers has the disadvantage of making the spread of viruses easier, thereby damaging third parties.

&gt;See above. You don't like what someone is selling, then don't buy it. There's no dictation going on. You're not forced to buy what people are selling.

Only dead people don't need anything. With that reasoning, someone pointing a gun in your direction isn't threatening you but merely exercising his right to move about freely.

Essentially, they do. Once they note a need for change, they request a proposal from the Commission (who essentially handle the legal side of it). Once that's complete, the Parliament discuss the proposals, agree on any changes, and then present their final proposal to the Council. The Parliament can always veto the Council's decision though. More information can be found [here](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/0080a6d3d8/Ordinary-legislative-procedure.html).

&gt; How [does it faciliate trade]?

To cite [Nitsch and Pisu](http://www.voxeu.org/article/how-did-euro-boost-trade-microeconomic-evidence) (two experts with much more knowledge than both of us I'm sure):

&gt; These results suggest that the euro has lowered the fixed and/or variable costs of exports. Some smaller and less productive firms now find exports to the euro-area profitable. The newly exported goods are of lower unit values than those previously exported because the euro has made exporting them profitable, particularly for small exporters.

----

&gt; How? I was in Rome last December, I'll be in Venice this New Year. I wouldn't not do just because of the Euro, just like i didn't not go to the Netherlands, Germany and France before the Euro.

Ah yes, another common fallacy. Just because one person doesn't take advantage of the benefits provided doesn't mean that nobody does. I've lived in Belgium for the past 14 years, and before the Euro was introduced it was a pain to travel to the neighbouring countries. Usually what happened was I'd end up with loads of foreign change that I'd either have to put somewhere safe until I visited next time, or go to the effort of getting it exchanged, which generally wasn't worthwhile due to any commission charged. Now, with the introduction of the Euro, a trip across the border isn't something that needs any planning, and makes citizens much more likely to travel.

One of the huge downsides to the Lisbon Treaty was that it was a reform treaty, so even if people thought they had a good handle on what was in the Maastricht and Nice treaties before it,  it could all have changed retrospectively.  Wait until 2014, the European elections, and when  people suddenly realise the other 'little' changes to voting reform that it's brought in, that's when the fur is really going to fly (and not just in the UK)!

People may well curse under their breath when the UK stands up for the n^th time only to appear to put the brakes on something else, but there's good reason why they passed their own 2011 European Act.  The Lisbon Treaty became a treaty because the European Constitution required member state referendums on constitutions, which they couldn't get passed.  Few countries had it in their own constitutions however that they needed a referendum for an EU treaty  - so essentially everything in the failed EU Constitution was passed via the backdoor by introducing a reform treaty on previous agreements.

Grumpy old UK, maybe, but the reason why a UK referendum is the big talking point is because they've now passed an Act through their own parliament which means a referendum must be held on any future EU treaty that signs power over.  Previously major changes had to be unanimous, from 2014 that will no longer be the case, so the UK forcing itself to be the battleground for future reform and new EU powers is something, I think, other EU countries will in time be thankful for.  Countries after all blocked the proposed EU constitution for a reason but they got around it.  This attempts to stop more of the same.

I'm just going to come out and say it; the UK is like Batman.

As in, at a wedding the priest will spend the better part of an hour chanting mostly about the complementary nature of the male-female relationship and how the importance it has when it comes to establishing a household/family. Here on the eastern Europe it's common knowledge that it's a thing that no one has a say in. To ask for marriage between persons of the same sex to become mainstream is like asking for babies to be baptized in maple syrup or for people to be buried under an intersection. There's nothing inherently or objectively wrong about it, however, it is ultimately a desecration of a basic christian rite. Which is the entire point and the only reason to undergo a rite, the rite itself in its entirety. When you deviate from an aspect so fundamental, the very core of the rite, the male-female relationship, marriage becomes null and void. Which begs the burning question, why do gays suddenly love christianity so much? It's all ""smash patriarchy"" this, ""die cis scum"" that, until we get to marriage and then they do a 180. Now the Church is cool for some reason. Why would you, as a gay person, want to partake in anything that stands under the banner of christianity? Why is christianity all of the sudden the gatekeeper to your happiness? I'm gonna assume that most gays are not religious, so why are they so attached to the idea of undergoing a ritual in a christian place of worship, during which scriptures from christian mythology are recited? I have one or two good answers, but will not mention then here for the sake of keeping the discussion civil. Look, no one is stopping you making your own creed out of thin air and making it mainstream. Just look at mormonism. Believe it or not, no one is stopping you from establishing homosexualism as a mainstream thing. You could make up your ouw ceremonies and everything, have the priests sing Elton John songs, the whole deal. Which, assuming that you are truly a homosexual, would make you just as happy since you never wanted to appeal to straight people anyway.

You'll notice that the EU isn't the only political and economic organization in the world. There is the African Union, the Arab League, ASEAN, UNASAR etc. More countries are integrating because the EU has provided them with a successful template that has led to peace and prosperity. Don't forget that the EU is not just a trade bloc. It is also a political organization with the goal of getting Europe to work together.
