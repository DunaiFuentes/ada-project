I had to be circumcised at age 32 for medical reasons and it wasn't such a big deal either, though I wish my parents had taken care of that much earlier. Just like with babies, the doctors used local anesthetics only and I got pain medication for a day. Most pain came from erections anyways (I woke up from erections at night).

But back to the point: What I see in connection with the circumcision debate in Germany is such a brutal racism and anti semitism that I thought was not possible anymore. At least not in public. Fuck GigaGrey and is invocaion of Godwin's law. I frequently see ""Muslims and Jews can't be Germans"" and very similar statements. 

This is not good. Not the circumcision or the judgement (though it will only lead to unsafe practices), but the current discussion about it.

In 2009, Christoforakos told to the German authorities that he paid off Greek politicians until 2007. His testinony was obtained by Telloglou, an investigative journalist. Of course, before leaving Greece, he denied everything. He denied everything even when Greeks questioned him in Germany. This is a farce, going all the way to the top. A recent development shows that [bribes were used for OTE](http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_2_02/05/2012_480728), which is now run by Deutsche Telekom.

Anyway, everything that needs to be said about this case *has* been said before: a) Siemens paid fines, got heavy flak in Germany, etc., so this is hardly a good example of how corrupt German companies are, and b) somehow magically, Siemens never had a similar corruption scandal inside, say, Germany. The latter doesn't excuse the behavior of Siemens,  but it probably should make Greek politicians and voter think about the level of corruption in their economy. **Read before you downvote:** This is not the same as saying ""Siemens is innocent, Greeks are at fault"", it's a bit more complex than that.

I was responding to a comment that said, basically, that Western-style democracies have an inherent economic disadvantage compared to less-participatory countries like China, because of China's ability to implement a more interventionist economic policy.

My point about GDP per capita was in that context, and your remark about ""Norway has a higher GPD per capita than Germany"" misses my point . Luxemburgh has an even higher GDP per capita, but all three of those countries are in the ""same league"" -- they are highly developed &amp; industrialized, have relatively strong social security, a high level of  higher education among their population, a strong middle class, have a high output of university level research etc. 

China is not such a country. They probably soon will be, and I'm not afraid of that, in fact, I think it's a good thing. But they're not there yet. And my remark about ""GDP per capita"" was shorthand for their level of development: I know it's not exhaustive, but it's  a pretty good indicator for how far a country has come.

Finally, my original point was this: if Chinas interventionist, part-centralized part-market-driven economic style is *really* better than our economic system (of less planning) will only be answered once China is at a relative level of development as our economies.

Apparently not in the first generation. Repeating it a few times does cause a major danger, however. In any case incest is SEX between relatives - reproduction is a different issue, and can be banned separately. 

I mean if the brother has his tubes tied, sister has a birth control patch and they're using a condom while the sister is giving the brother head, what exactly is the problem, besides the ""ick""?

Obviously the reason for the taboo is the long term genetic damage, which has to get ground in pretty easily rather like heterosexuality: you're more likely to pass on your genes if you don't have retarded children (or in the case of people who don't want to have sex with the opposite gender, not having children at all).",0,1342279996,null,0,false,0,c5dy3gz,t3_wizfl,t1_c5dy3gz,t1_c5dxzjh,null,1429375142,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

My talking in terms of classes is a deliberate attempt to increase the idea that society is in fact divided in classes. Words are tools you know, which have the power to create realities.

&gt; I'm not saying that cracking down on tax fraud is wrong, quite the contrary, is is very important to do so. However I can't really see how one can enjoy it more when a rich person is caught from doing it than when a blue-collar workman is caught doing it. Both have done equally wrong and have to make up to the society damages that they have caused.

I agree with Belgium not being a roman nation, but I reacted on your following statement:

which makes imho no sense culturally nor linguistically.

Point being: Belgium is relatively new so telling ""Belgium shares a lot of history with [...]"" isn't really correct.

Are you referring to the creation of United Kingdom of the Netherlands? I find it strange that this type of international politics (creating a buffer state) takes precedence in your ranking over sharing the same language, having a very similar culture and having close historical ties.

&gt; and there is still a lot of cultural exchange between France/UK and Belgium.

Depends on the part of the country. There is more cultural exchange between Flanders/Netherlands than between Flanders/France or between Wallonia/Netherlands.

* [The German Problem With Corruption](http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,1489467,00.html) (DW)

&gt; ""The perception that Germany has no corruption problem has absolutely *nothing to do with reality*, but rather with the fact that *a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light*,"" said Uwe Dolata, press spokesman for the trade union representing Germany's criminal police (BDK).

* [How corrupt is Germany?](http://www.cnbcmagazine.com/story/how-corrupt-is-germany/85/1/) (CNBC)

&gt; Germany is reeling. Deutschland GmbH, famed for the quality of its products rather than the largesse of its bribes, has been rocked by scandal after scandal. Nowhere is this more evident and more surprising than in the case of Siemens, the Bavarian power and communications giant embroiled in the largest bribery case in the history of the Federal Republic. *Siemens is not alone, however.* Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank, Infineon, Deutsche Bahn, GM/Opel, Linde and Ratiopharm have all been the subject of stories about questionable practices that management either knew nothing of or actively participated in.


* Germany is in the top-10 countries of the [Financial Secrecy Index](http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/2011results.html) (2011)

&gt; The index ... reveals the *illicit financial flows* that keep developing nations poor are predominantly enabled by rich OECD member countries and their satellites, which are the main recipients of these illicit flows.

&gt; Unterdessen sieht der Bund der Steuerzahler wegen des ESM Steuererhöhungen auf die Deutschen zukommen. Dafür gebe es ein „hohes Risiko“, sagte Präsident Reiner Holznagel gegenüber MDR Info. Es gehe in der europäischen Rettungspolitik um Milliarden, und die deutschen Steuerzahler seien diejenigen, die am kräftigsten dazu beitragen müssten. Insofern sei „die Gefahr hoch, dass zukünftig Steuererhöhungen anstehen“. Der Bundestag hätte dem ESM eigentlich nicht zustimmen dürfen, sagte Holznagel weiter. Schon jetzt betrage die Pro-Kopf-Verschuldung 25.000 Euro. Wenn man Risiken und Haftungspotenziale dazurechne, komme man schnell auf 30.000 bis 35.000 Euro.

true,Oda_Krell,EURO,"German, living in the Netherlands","First: the claim ""foreign bribery was legal in Germany until recently"" needs some backup. In another comment, I asked for confirmation for this claim, and got a Wikipedia article. To me it looks like in reality, only relatively recently did Germany introduce a law that is specifically  crafted to **fight** foreign bribery -- that's not at all the same as saying it was ""legal"" until then. 

Second: not really good citation practice you have there. Let's see what you have: an article about a man who says that Siemens was involved in bribery in those countries. Settlement followed for the US, which means Siemens presumably did use briberey in the US, possibly other countries, but without them being convicted for it, that's more conjecture than fact. And then another article, more opinion piece than a survey, about the question ""how corrupt is Germany"". And that's a wonderful question. But how about:

[""How corrupt is Europe""](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/06/06/just-how-corrupt-is-europe/)

[""How corrupt is Mongolia?""](http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2012/06/201262973536776654.html)

[""How corrupt is the United States?""](http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Donald-Marron/2010/1101/How-corrupt-is-the-United-States)

That took me approximately 30 seconds to find. Do you see the pattern? It's ridiculously easy to find individual cases, or articles about those cases. What we need is some way to compare relative corruption in different countries, not a dickwaving contest who can find more articles that mention one case or another. And luckily, we *have* such a comparison: the [Corruption Perceptions Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index). You can rightfully critizise their methodology, and it's probably far from perfect, but that doesn't mean their results are outright wrong -- they should be taken as an indication, not as gospel.

So, what does it say? **Germany** has a value of **8.0 (in the year 2010)**, where 10 would be the least corruption, up from 7.4 in 2002. They're amont the 20 least corrupt nations, and they improved in the last 10 years. **Greece** has a value of **3.4 (in 2010)**, placing them in the category of China or Colombia. By the way, that's down from 4.2 in 2002, so according to Transparency International, it got worse in the past 10 years.

**So why the fuck are we having this discussion?** I already said it in my very first post: **I'm not excusing Siemens!** They used bribery? Well, that sucks. They should be convicted! Oh wait, they were, at least in Germany and the US. And two of their CEOs stepped down. And they lost a lot of repuation. Do you see how this works in a generally functioning, relatively non-corrupt society? 

Now what does all of that have to do with Greece? I can tell you: some people seem to think that the corruption problem of Greece is mainly a matter of perception, or caused by immoral entities from abroad, instead of mainly being a problem of Greece having corrupt institutions. You, it seems, are one of those.

No. It means that our economic system will always produce a class that makes profit without working for it, adds no value to society and obtains political power. This is a given of our system, which makes it a material reality instead of a figment of imagination, like racism.

It's been a while, but here's what I had to do and get, to the best of my memory:

**Go to an ADAC center and pay to have my US license officially translated.**

I don't remember the cost here, but it took a bit of time because they had to mail it somewhere else to get it translated, but I think this might depend on the city you're in. Don't bother paying AAA for that stupid ""International License"" because it's worthless (your driver's license is good for driving in just about every country you visit as a tourist, except maybe drive–left countries) and the Straßenverkehrsamt didn't want it. I don't remember if it was required that I get it translated through ADAC or not or if it just needs to be done by a professional place licensed to do it (so your roommate can't do it).

**Go to the local Straßenverkehrsamt.**

You'll have to fill out some forms, pay some fees, and provide them with a passport photo and your translation. I don't remember what other documents I needed to show them (probably my Aufenthaltstitel). Again, this will take some time because they need to wait for mail. But once your license is ready (it took a week or two or more, forgot) you go back to pick it up in person **and** they take your US license from you.

I think the idea is that when you leave you're suppose to give them back your German license and then they give you back your US one, but in my case I just went to the website of my MVD and reported that I ""lost"" my license and they sent a new one to my mom which I just picked up when I went to visit.

It didn't cost 2000€, but I think between the fees and the ADAC translations I paid at least 50€ or more? It's a cool little souvenir nonetheless.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; No. It means that our economic system will always produce a class that makes profit without working for it, adds no value to society and obtains political power. This is a given of our system, which makes it a material reality instead of a figment of imagination, like racism.

You are talking about inherited fortunes? I really don't see that big problem with it given of course that the state taxes inheritance with adequate amount, at least 10-20%, and makes as sure as possible that there aren't loopholes for people to avoid paying inheritance taxes.

You see inherited fortunes more or less disperse and disappear only in few generations. Those people who have inherited and have not had their money disappear are those people who have used, have made the money earn by making right investments. Can't see anything wrong with that.

Of course in theory it would be much better for our societies if people couldn't inherit, but would always have to earn their fortunes. However the problem with this is that people act irrationally, they want to give inheritance, they want to leave legacies, etc... This makes many tick, and if we would remove ability to leave inheritance, we would also remove much work motivation from people and thus would have less products of work to share.

to Lyon (overnight)

to Chateauneuf du Pape (just because its my mothers favourite wine;)

to Bonnieux (overnight maybe staying in Le Cesar)

passing Istres &amp; Montpellier

to Carcassonne (overnight)

passing Toulouse (Highway) or  Bergerac??

to Bordeaux (overnight, Paulliac or what? To much choice)

taking the Highway or what about the area of La Tremblade/Marennes?

to Angoulins (overnight)

now can't decide wether going to Nantes or skipping Nantes and going directly to Saumur

following the river to Sancerre (or Puilly Fume? Can't decide)

NOW depending on how well we're in time I'll take the route to Reims (overnight) passing Provins and going back down to Beaune (overnight) OR going directly from Sancerre to Beaune. Thinking about taking a walk in Dijon anyway. 

Overnight means, somewhere in that area. We got a car, so we dont need limit on the town for accomondation, no problem of driving to next cheaper village. We'll take a tent with us so campsides are a possibility too. We'll just take what we get, wether its bed and breakfast/ hostel or campside, whatever anyone can recommand in an area. 

What do you think of my route, anything you'll change or skip or add? Any attractions along the way I might wanna visit? Any beautiful lakes, cool markets, nice festival anyone can think of? I'll add activities/sightseeing/stops/accomondation etc and will update tomorrow.

There are different types of bribery. a) You bribe some official to be selected over your competitor for a project or whatever. b) You bribe to avoid time-consuming and unnecessary bureaucracy c) you bribe to get your job done, because the public servant/official is so blatantly corrupt. The last one is most common here in Greece. Want a surgery? Give money to the surgeon. Want to build something or get a license for your business? Bribe the employees at the urban planning department. They are the most notorious for not giving a fuck about your case(they will literally ignore it) if you don't bribe them. And you can't do anything about it. The courts will either have some kind of deal with the public servant/official or it's going to take too much time and money to get the case to the court, because of bureaucracy (greek justice is famous for being really slow). Plus there is this mafia mentality in every Greek profession branch - you fuck with one of us, you fuck will all of us.

So what does the state do about that? Well ...nothing. It is pretty obvious in the article that the cases came to light only by foreign investigations. Here in Greece either nobody bothered or the investigations were stalled and then forgotten. And it makes sense, because after all it looks like half the Greek politicians received bribe money one way or another.
&gt;The sealed report, which has not been made public, allegedly contains the names of 20 of the leading Greek politicians who have together received more than €100 million in recent years to ""promote"" the company, according to Greek press reports.

And that is just Siemens.
Siemens of course wasn't giving away the money because they were in a hurry to give the Greek people the technology they so needed. They probably made the x10 amount of money they gave away. And the money they made, was EU-money. Add to that that basically every company worked like that in Greece and you get a clue as to why we are in this shit.

true,StoneCall,SACH,Leipzig,"&gt; Clearly you don't, because it's nothing like that at all. I don't expect you to understand since Germany basically went without a flag for like 60 years, which may explain the lack of symbolism beyond football. 

Which 60 years are you referring to?

&gt; A more apt comparison would be if you went to the U.S. and saw them stuffing their flags into their exhaust pipes and running them over with their cars, and thinking to yourself, ""That's an odd thing to do! Maybe there's a football match somewhere.""

While I laughed out loud upon reading this due to the absurdity of the situation, I don't think you understood my point. The American flag has a completely different meaning to an American than the German flag has to a German. You tried to apply American standards to German flags, and I said what I would do if I would apply German standards to American flags.

&gt; Like you said, the flag is shorthand for the country, and I prefer not to treat my country in a disrespectful way.

See - that's the difference.

You see the American flag as a symbol of the entire country, and consider it a personal attack when America is attacked. I see the German flag as the visual version of the word ""Germany"", and I couldn't care less when somebody attacks Germany (as long as it's done with words and not with tanks).

Other than that, I don't think you can actually disrespect a country - you can disrespect people or culture, sure, but not a country.

&gt; Call it nationalism if you want.

I'm not calling it nationalism. I think you overestimate what the German flag means to Germans, and what Germany means to Germans.

&gt; The first thing you learn as an American about the flag is that it should never touch the ground. If I proceeded to place any other country's flag on the ground, it would be a sign of disrespect to that country, regardless of whether they saw it that way or not.

Interesting, I didn't know that. Needless to say, if you would've placed a German flag on the floor without telling me that, I probably wouldn't have noticed.

&gt; Oh, and since you mention the Pledge of Allegiance, I don't like it either, but you should know that it shares common roots with the Nazi salute and their nationalist pledges. Google ""Bellamy"". 

I was referring to the fact that the pledge of allegiance refers to pledging allegiance to a flag - that's not because one expects the flag to give orders you have to obey, that's because the flag is seen as a symbol for the entire country, and not just a description.

To reiterate the above comparison, to a German the pledge of allegiance would be equivalent to ""I pledge allegiance to the word 'America'"".

&gt; Lastly, please don't try to imply that Germany has evolved beyond nationalism. You would only be fooling yourself. 

I don't see where you read that, but I know there is nationalism in Germany in various forms. And although there is much more nationalism behind closed doors than in the open, I still think that Germany is one of the less nationalistic countries in the world.",0,1342309743,null,0,false,0,c5e3vfn,t3_wk76c,t1_c5e3vfn,t1_c5e3he7,null,1429377908,7,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,7

* So areas with high population density, with higher rents, will appear to have higher purchasing power (even though they have to pay higher rent).
* Countries with generous pension systems (like the Netherlands) will score low because of the higher taxes needed to support it.
* Countries like Norway which has high tariffs on everything will also in reality have lower purchase power as this study seems to only calculate the purchasing power after wages and taxes and not on actual prices.

It's true that Scandinavia is not as socialist as it once was, but there is a very strong influence of socialism here, including Marxism–which I think has had beneficial effects, and avoided most of the negative effects in the Warsaw Pact's authoritarian version of it.

The ruling party in Sweden was explicitly Marxist for the first three decades after WW2, though anti-Soviet, and following a line that socialism was best implemented via incremental reform. They ended up being voted out of power before they completed the (very) slow process, when they overstepped what their political popularity could support. Their most audacious attempt was to institute a program where 20% of all companies' profits would go to the labour unions, which would be used to slowly purchase the companies's shares, so they'd eventually be owned by the workers. The capitalists (unsurprisingly) basically declared war at that point, and ended the previous arrangement of grudging acquiescence. But the state has retained a significant and generally beneficial role, with taxes at ~50% of GDP and a very strong safety net.

There's a Finnish company that started a small fiscal bureau in Belgium. Tis bureau provided labour for one and a half employee and was given the task to look over the financial department of different Finnish energy companies. Thanks to our carefully planned tax system, the owners of this company managed to divert 313 millions of euros. That's money that should be collected by your governments and could have been invested in Finland, but instead was likely put in an oil plant somewhere in Siberia.

What you said about inheritance might be the case in Finland, but not in Belgium, where the last 20 years inequality has widened. 53% of our taxes comes from labour taxes, 7% from capital, while the 10% most rich do own 53% of all worth. Our most rich family has a personal fortune of 14 billion euros, which was multiplied by 15 in the last 10 years. And that's why I still like to talk about a Bourgeois class.

* Publication of some guidelines for each minister. For example, the dropping of others public functions (a ministry can also be a mayor in Fance), and some rules of behaviour (private interest, etc.). 
* Families with children get some money in September to help them pay the cost of school, like books and stuff. Increased by 25%.
* Age of retirement brought back to 60 if you started working at 18 and worked for 41 years. It was changed by the previous gov. and introduced some major conflicts with labor unions.
* Modification of a law about the rights of foreign students. Now easier to hire a foreign graduate.
* Freeze of some public expenses while waiting for analysis of public accounts.
* Pact of responsability and growth submitted to the EU members.
* Military withdrawal from Afghanistan.

**On the tracks**

* Maximum ratio of 20 between the lowest and highest salaries in public administrations and companies.
* Easier renting for young people.
* Rethinking of the national defense (military).

**Late or postponed**

* Freeze of oil price for 3 months : it was supposed to be done if oil price kept going up, it has decreased since then.
* Every frenchman can have one savings account called ""Livret A"" where interest rate if fixed by the government, according to the National Bank and the European Bank. This rate should be increased to be superior to inflation. They're also capped at around 15.000€ which should be doubled.
* Policemen will no more give a note to people they randomly ""check"". ~~This was introduce right before the election by the previous gov.~~ It was planned by the new gov. to avoid people being scanned because of their faces, thanks Foxkilt.
* 75% taxes on really high salaries (more than a million per year) : more time needed.

It is just sad, that progress will be slower because of this, but in my opinion, the situation can only be solved by a combination of the following two:

1. The medical community and health insurers should point out that this has no proven benefit in any medical sense. There are still too many people who believe that. On the other hand, like any medical procedure it has risks.

2. Religious groups should influence their ""sheeps"" to understand that religous service to any God should be more about acts of ""loving thy neighbor"" than about some symbols of religiosity.

Why? Very simple: law has the function to enable a peaceful and just living together. If law alienates a large portion of the population, it doesn't serve this goal.

Hollande is a really quiet president compared to Sarkozy and seems focused on the important things. He will now be able to make everything he wants to happen as his political union won the Legislatives elections (lower chamber of deputies). 

They own for the first time the whole political apparel : President, highest (never happened before) and lowest chambers of representatives, near all of the regions, most of the departments, most of the big cities. Although this might be frightening, it has already happened before for the liberal party. This will give him the whole freedom to act without too much hassle from the right wing.

Now, the major concern is obviously public expenses. France **can't** continue to spend so much with so few public revenues. There are too much people working and paid by the government and the most important things for the next 50 years are in free fall : public education and research. The hardest part has yet to come and it will be the decisional factor for the future of France and European Union. Greece is falling, as will probably Italy and Spain and we might be next in line if we don't shake ourselves really fast. This will require a huge effort from everybody (and hopefully from the richest people) to fully engage France into the 21st century. 

This might also be the end of an era, according to the rise of the far right (see Marine LePen) and the difficulties for the left wing to hold the power, Hollande only being the 2nd socialist president since 1958. On the international side, his first G8 summit went pretty good, as well as his first meeting with Obama days before.

In my opinion, don't pay for a flamenco show, look for a bar that's showing it. Buy a beer, pick out some tapas and pack in with the locals to really soak up some flavor (on Calle Betis in the neighborhood Triana there's a great one called T. de Triana)
Go to the Cathedral. Hard to miss the biggest gothic cathedral in the world (3rd biggest cathedral period).
Like shopping? Hit up Calle Tetuan or Calle Sierpes for the best shops (not necessarily the best deals).
Visit the Alcázar, which is very close to the Cathedral. If you're a student it's free and it's a gorgeous arabic structure with unbelievable gardens, great spot to siesta in.
Also don't forget to check out Parque María Luisa and visit the Plaza de España (great to visit also if you like Star Wars, a scene was filmed there).
for bars... take your pick, honestly. Stay away from main streets if you want a little local culture, there's an amazing tapas bar on Calle Garcia Vinuesa, I forget the name of the bar, however. At Las Alamedas you'll find a slew of good cheap bars, if you like hippie neighborhoods. Los Remedios and Triana both offer some great bars as well (Calle Betis). If you like big clubs however: go to Cu de Tát. Crazy big bar, but I believe some nights it has a cover (includes a mixed drink, however).
For your breakfast, go to a bar/café and order tostada con tomate, that was always my favorite, or get tostada with whatever else you want on there.
Grab a litre of Cruzcampo (the beer of choice for all andalucíans), a packet of sunflower seeds and head down next to the river near the Puente de Triana for a great afternoon.
Also right next to the Puente de Triana is a churro stand. This churro stand is a MUST hit when you're out drunk at 4am.

true,Nihy,ASTR,Austria,"Imo the Grundrecht is clear on this. Every person has the right to body integrity. 

Freedom of religion goes both ways - the child has the right to religious freedom as well. Parents should have no right to force a religious/cultural mark on their child (and circumcision is just that, the claims of health benefits are not based on good science).

There's nothing stopping the Rabbis and Imans to change their traditions to voluntary circumcision of a consenting adult. Perhaps they fear that a grown man is old enough to question the practice?

**Edit 1**
Also Grundrecht should trump religious freedom, otherwise it (theoretically) opens the door to justifying crimes on religious grounds. What if I found a religion called Nihy-ism that dictates that non-believers should have their earlobes cut without consent? It's ridiculous and criminal right? But why is it OK to do the same to the foreskin of children? Only because of political pressure. This sets a bad precedent for allowing violation of the law on religious grounds given sufficient political pressure. It's just stupid.

**Edit 2**
The law exists to protect the weak. In this case, the child is the weak and cultural/religious pressure is the strong trying to force something onto the child that he might not agree with if given the choice. Despite what religious people (who like to paint a harmonious picture) say there are circumcised men of muslim/jewish parents who think their circumcision was wrong and suffered from it.

""It is not a mutilation, it is not a mutilation, I am not mutilated, no no no!"" doesnt become true by simply repeating it like a religious mantra, which it actually is.

Circumcision is cutting off a sensitive, sexually relevant part of the body without medical necessity. 

The foreskin contains a great number of errogeneous nerve endings, which increase the sexual pleasure of the man. About 3/4 of nerve endings of a penis are removed when the foreskin is removed. Without the foreskin, the glans becomes keratinized (calloused). The free nerve endings in the glans become buried in layers of callused skin. The foreskin provides a natural gliding mechanism which facilitates insertion and reduces friction and chafing during sex. The gliding mechanism greatly faciliates masturbation, circumcised men are often forced to use lube because ""going dry"" hurts. Apart from the sexual function, the foreskin protects the glans from unpleasent chafing on underwear.

How is simply removing all these naturally provided functions _not_ a mutilation?",0,1342351876,null,0,false,0,c5ea5o1,t3_wk4uw,t1_c5ea5o1,t1_c5e9qzm,null,1429380937,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

Between 1848 and 1933, there was an almost constant ""flag battle"" between black-red-gold (symbol of the ""new Germany"": democratic and united) and black-white-red (symbol of the ""old Germany"": monarchistic and divided) with each political group considering their flag the correct one.

During Nazi times, the the swastika flag (and also especially in the beginning the black-white-red flag) was everywhere; black-red-gold was denounced as a symbol of the Weimar Republic and forbidden to display.

When black-red-gold was made flag of the FRG in 1949, only 25% of the population agreed with the choice.

In the GDR, the black-red-gold flag with the state seal (hammer and compass in a garland of corn) was a very common sight and was interpreted symbolically (hammer for the workers, compass for the intelligentsia and garland of corn for the farmers). I even learned a song about it in school.

Here is a quote from Daniel Cohn-Bendit, European representative of the Green Party, from chapter 9 of his book “*Der grosse Basar*” (The Great Bazaar), published in 1975.  
    

“I had long discussions with the parents. I told them that their children’s needs had always been neglected. The parents accepted me as a caregiver. I worked in that kindergarten for two years. The children were between two and five years old. I played with them an awful lot, romped with the children, I completely identified with them. I wanted the children to like me, and I did everything that they became dependent. With the children, I became aware that this need of making others dependent actually existed in all my relationships. My constant flirts with all children began to assume erotic features. I could feel how little five-year old girls had learnt to turn me on. Several times there were children that opened my fly and started to caress me. Depending on the situation, I reacted differently, but their wish faced me with problems. I asked them: ‘Why don’t you play with each other, why have you chosen me and not the other children?’ But when they insisted, I allowed them to caress me.”

&gt; She was a gas-dealer, an oligarch implicated in bribind russian officials.

Tymoshenko was the president of the United Energy Systems of Ukraine, a privately owned middleman company that became the main importer of Russian natural gas to Ukraine in 1996. During that time she was nicknamed ""gas princess"" in **light of accusations that she had been reselling enormous quantities of stolen gas and avoiding taxation of those deals**. She was also accused of ""having given Pavlo Lazarenko kickbacks in exchange for her company's stranglehold on the country's gas supplies"".[36] During this period Tymoshenko was involved in business relations (either co-operative or hostile) with many important figures of Ukraine. The list includes Pavlo Lazarenko, Viktor Pinchuk, Ihor Kolomoyskyi, Sergei Tigipko, Leonid Kuchma who at that time was the President of Ukraine. All of these are, like Tymoshenko, originally from Dnipropetrovsk. **Tymoshenko has also been closely linked to the management of the Russian corporation, Gazprom.[37]** In the period 1995-1997 Tymoshenko **was considered one of the richest business people in Ukraine. [36]**

In spite of being cleared of the charges, Moscow maintained an arrest warrant for Tymoshenko should she enter Russia until her dismissal as Prime Minister four years later.[55][56] This case was reopened in Ukraine on 24 October 2011.[57]

&gt; This case was dropped once she met Putin.

11 August 2001 civilian and military prosecutors in Russia opened a new criminal case against Tymoshenko accusing her of bribery.[64] On December 27, 2005 Russian prosecutors dropped these charges. Russian prosecutors had suspended an arrest warrant when she was appointed Prime Minister in but reinstated it after she was fired in September 2005. The prosecutors suspended it again when she came to Moscow for questioning[65] on September 25, 2005.[66]

&gt; I still think it's ridiculous you jailed a politician for solving a gas crisis with the retroactive view that the deal wasn't as good as some people think it should have been.

She solved absolutely nothing. She helped to create the crisis. She did not sign the contracts, **she abused her powers** to force the head of the state company to sign them.",0,1342365100,null,0,false,0,c5ebo9p,t3_wl77e,t1_c5ebo9p,t1_c5eb2n1,null,1429381652,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

Especially after I said, in bold, that I don't support letting Siemens off the hook easily. But reality is, Siemens *wasn't* let off the hook easily: they saw two CEOs step down, paid fines/settlements in Germany, the US (and an EU fine, in another matter), and lost a lot of reputation.

Maybe I should make my standpoint more clear: I don't believe for one second that Germans, the people, are inherently more moral (or less corrupt) than Greek people. 

But that said, Germany, as a country, and its institutions *are* less prone to corruption. Not **free** of corruption, but less prone to it. If you want I can say it like this: Germany has more (working) institutions in place that control the corrupt nature of Germans. Greece has less (working) institutions in place to do so. As a result, Greece suffer from a bigger corruption problem than Germany.

That's, in a nutshell, my standpoint. And I hate most of this comment thread because a bunch of clowns like notangelamerkel (or whatever his name is) build up strawmen arguments, that make it sound like I believe that Greek are ""genetically inferior"" or some bullshit like that.

EDIT: If by ""insult"" you meant my response to notangelamerkel, then I am absolutely unapologetic.

De Fries/Nederlandse scheiding is minder sterk dan bijvoorbeeld de Schots/Engelse scheiding is.

Soms komt er een 'Friesisme' in voor wanneer bijvoorbeeld een zinsbouw meer Fries dan Nederlands is, maar vaak is dat ook in het Nederlands nog correct of acceptabel. Het Fries wordt wel steeds meer beïnvloed door het Nederlands, dus zelfs wanneer iemand 'puur' Fries spreekt met andere Friezen komen er eigenlijk veel Nederlandse termen in voor.

Er bestaat ook een dialect, ik spreek het zelf, dat het Bildts heet. Het wordt alleen gesproken in de gemeente het Bildt en is een beetje een vermenging tussen Nederlands en Fries. Het ontstond zo'n vijf honderd jaar geleden toen vooral Zuid-Hollanders, monniken vaak, geloof ik, het Bildt in kwamen polderen. Op het Bildt bleef dat Zuid-Hollands gesproken worden en over de eeuwen is dat Zuid-Hollands vermengd met het Fries. En later werden Fries en Bildt beide weer meer 'Nederlands' toen er een soort nationale gelijkschakeling ontstond o.a. doordat het makkelijker werd contact met andere delen van het land te hebben. Dit effect loopt nog steeds door natuurlijk; het Fries en het Bildts worden steeds 'Hollandser.' Ik neem aan dat dit ook in Duitsland zo is. Andere streektalen en regionale dialecten hebben ook te maken met deze gelijktrekken, trouwens.

&gt; In the last 10 years the City of London has caught up and overtaken New York as a world financial capital.

There is no way to study the subject of money-laundering as we study Biology, for example. It can't be done. We're talking about a criminal activity, taking place under the radar. It's difficult to quantify it, but the volume and the scale of operations, along with the lax regulatory framework, can give us an idea. You can find many [theses in EThOS](http://ethos.bl.uk), and see the approach researchers take when studying the matter.

Professionals use models to approach the situation, but they need serious updates when [things change](http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-06-20/home/30051068_1_money-laundering-financial-action-task-force-imf).

&gt; One necessary update to Walker’s models is that both the City of London and Wall Street now (2011) play a bigger part in global money laundering than they did in 1998.

&gt; “The capacity of these financial centres to carry out financial operations at larger scales makes them vulnerable despite the perceived strong regulatory initiatives. Also, *there is a further perceived legitimacy to the laundering of funds if they go through London or New York*,” said Dr Demetis. 

[Demetis](http://www.gresham.ac.uk/professors-and-speakers/dr-dionysios-s-demetis) has a PhD on Anti-Money Laundering from LSE.

CIA's Factbook lists [UK](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uk.html) and [US](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html) as money-laundering centres. Switzerland is also listed, with the explanation that it is ""a major international financial center vulnerable to the layering and integration stages of money laundering"". There is no mention for money-laundering in the case of [Germany](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html) (listed as a ""major financial center""). Of course money-laundering takes place in Germany too, but it's on a different (lower) level compared to others. IMF has the UK, but not Germany, in a table with [""Countries, Territories, and Jurisdictions with Offshore Financial Centers""](http://www.imf.org/external/np/mae/oshore/2000/eng/back.htm).

With the crises in the EU and the US, UK seems an ideal destination for money-laundering activities.

That's false.

NATO expansion, however, is a big concern for them, and quite understandably.

Not to mention that all that talk by Ukrainian politicians about joining EU is pure populism, it's an empty promise of better life by people who can't actually deliver results.

On a side note I have to stress here the great disease that Poland has been suffering from for more than 50 years - communism. It's left a huge stain on the people and the mentality. It has taught the Poles that their country is one monolith culturally - one that can be steered with one-reform-rules-it-all strategy. It is not so. The government is blatantly disregarding Silesians with their autonomy claims, there still exists Poland A (richer West) and Poland B (really really poor East) and don't get me started on the ecstatic willingness of young Poles to take ANY kind of loan just to look better than their neighbors!

The disadvantage is that Poland hasn't a really strong sector. (like Germany industry, Spain tourism or UK finances).

The good point is that they can do OK in many parts of economy: 

-Industry: wages are not very high, Poland is near many countries that demand products (Germany, Scandinavian countries...), they haven't the Euro and they are going to receive funds from Europe (or at least were supposed to before the crisis) in order to build modern infrastructures.

-Tourism: there are great sites to go like Kraków. Nature might be important in this sector. Infrastructures must be improved (airports, trains and urban transport). Education is useful too (English). 

-Science and R&amp;D: this is really hard. Becoming part of European organisations like the ESA, EADS, etc... so they can put scientists there (and then going back to Poland) is a good starting point but it requires extensive funding.

-Banks and finance: right now is not the best moment for this but the focus should be on getting loans for new business (that is: attracting international investors).

Summing up: Europe, Europe, Europe. Almost everything applies to the other new members of the EU.

I know that's not the reality, but saying that poland is about to become the next economic powerhouse is really like saying Mexico closes it's borders because so many americans want in. 6th biggest EU-economy? Well that may be, maybe they profited from being neighbours to Germany and getting rid of russian influence.

We would always joke that one Pole had to make up for the loss created by one German worker and had to make profit for the farmer. Thankfully the Germans (if they weren't from the older generation) would only stay for two weeks, then get back problems or some other health hazard, and stay home after that.

There is a pragmatic aspect too, in that it is very hard to hide a circumcision and if someone gets a back-alley job done they would risk losing their children and having them brought up as an unbeliever.

true,ajuc,POLA,Poland,"Nice things: we are getting richer on average, mostly thanks to free EU market and cheap labour cost here (also thanks to donations from EU, but they account for sth like 1% of our GDP). We're also in the middle of insane education boom. We have free public education all the way to M.A degree, and the cultural norm is to go all the way to M.A. And most (I think sth like 80%) kids do exactly this. This of course means universities lowered their standards to accept all the money from state (coming with each student). So this is mixed blessing. But still - compared with most countries we have very good average education, and it's still improving. This makes for big competition on job market, and cheap educated labour.

Bad things: small salaries. Most people earn sth like 500 euro per month (yeah, average salary is greater, it doesn't change the fact most people get less than average salary). With small salaries comes internal and external brain drain (best go work abroad or to a few biggest cities), few kids (currently Polish baby boom from '80 has 20-30 years, starts working, marry, but still people don't have children, and one of the reasons is money, and financial stability).

Most of my friends married in last few years, work in IT, financial services, law or education in one of top Polish 10 cities, or abroad. And these in Poland will pay off their house in 20-30 years, or still live with parents, and they earn just enough money to pay all bills and go for 2 week holidays somewhere near. No way to save real money, or have some stability.

With brain drain and no money comes another Polish problem - too few innovative products. We work hard, we are educated, but we don't take risks - this credit for house won't pay off itself, after all, stop dreaming about your startup and go to your job already.

We also have too much law, and too much bureaucracy, and our politician class is comming from '80, and don't understand modern world (PIS, PO, other parties, don't really matter - they live in different world). But that will change with time, I hope. The good think is that most voters are young now, and parties have to pander for them.
 
Another problem comes from the fact Poland enetered EU - one half of the country depended on trade and cooperation with Ukraine, Belarus, Russia. Now this trade almost died out, because of strict laws, controls, political arguments, etc. That means eastern Poland isn't growing as fast as western Poland (with a few exceptions like IT sector or cheap education). There are big opportunities here, the low hanging fruit is opening up trade and cooperation with Ukraine, but this needs to be confirmed by EU, and Ukraine isn't 100% democratic country (but still much better than Russia or Belarus), so EU has objections.

It's an extremely conservative country, very catholic in rhetoric if not in fact. A nation of extremely low national self esteem, which mixes inner self loathing with outward aggression. A nation that celebrates its defeats instead of its victories. Not too long ago, we marked our longest period of independence in over 200 years with smaller ceremonies than are held every year to celebrate the disastrously failed Warsaw Uprising. And of course everybody stands with full carts in supermarkets, complaining about how poor they are.

I'm personally amazed by what we've achieved, and what we keep achieving. Get the rhetoric out of the way and we have a thriving economy, the large cities bussle day and night. Lots of local tourism is doing poorly not because Poles are poor, but because they're choosing to travel abroad for holidays.

Honestly, I can't tell you from experience how Poland as a whole is doing, because I live in Warsaw. The change in this city in the just the past 5 years has been amazing, and it's almost all for the better. Infrastructure is getting built - slowly, but compared to communist times it's like every construction site has a rocket up its ass. Culturally it's extremely vibrant, mostly in spite of the city government instead of thanks to it. Between my linguistic and marketable skills and dual US-Polish citizenship, I could live and work in a lot of places, but I'm very glad I stayed here. I think historians will be able to recognize this incredible era of transition and growth for what it is, even my countrymen are unable to do so now.

Look, it's going to take a generational change for Poland to get over it's communist past and martyrdom complex. Those take time. Our economy wasn't as progressive as the Czech Republic's or Lithuania's during the good times, just because it's so much bigger than either of theirs, but it's letting us shoulder the world-wide recession much better.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;What exactly? BYT is now lead by a KGB officer in the second (or third) generation.

And the prime minister of Ukraine is an officer who never served, and seems numerous fake academic titles to his name. There are plenty of ex-soviet people in positions of power in eastern Europe, I think this is an inevitability for a while yet.

&gt;light of accusations that she had been reselling enormous quantities of stolen gas and avoiding taxation of those deals.

Accusations mean nothing. Proof is necessary, if you have it, bring it.

&gt;Tymoshenko has also been closely linked to the management of the Russian corporation, Gazprom.

Inevitably, since for 2 years she was head of the family company which imported gas, and Russia has almost all of the gas Ukraine uses.

&gt;In the period 1995-1997 Tymoshenko was considered one of the richest business people in Ukraine. [36]

This is completely irrelevant, frankly. It no longer applies either.

&gt;Moscow maintained an arrest warrant for Tymoshenko should she enter Russia until her dismissal as Prime Minister four years later.

Sorry, why were Moscow maintaining charges against a Ukrainian who had been *supposedly* doing dirty deals with another Ukrainian? What did it have to do with them?

&gt;11 August 2001 civilian and military prosecutors in Russia opened a new criminal case against Tymoshenko accusing her of bribery.

This was no doubt as clean and honest as all other Russian justice proceedings...

&gt;The prosecutors suspended it again when she came to Moscow for questioning[65] on September 25, 2005.[66]

Is *this* your evidence for her being friends with Putin? I sincerely hope not because that would constitute really terrible evidence.

&gt;She helped to create the crisis. She did not sign the contracts, she abused her powers to force the head of the state company to sign them.

Yes, she ordered contracts signed, but Naftogaz is state owned - in no other country would that be considered a strange act for a prime minister to undertake, especially not in the midst of a national energy crisis.

Is the infrastructure really being built? Or just more skyscrapers?

It's a Kreisstadt, so it has the administrative buildings in the district: you'll need these to register your address, that sort of thing.

But when I go to the Siebenstern in Vienna, the prices are roughly the same, food prices are the same in the restaurant and drink prices only slightly higher and I assume the owners expect similar rates of profits. So where exactly that €800 / month more the Austrian water makes over the Hungarian watier comes from? Out of whose pocket? Not the customer as the prices are not much higher. I don't really think it comes from the owner either, as the Hungarian owner is not making so huge profits eather, €3000 profits a month for an average restaurant are considered great in Hungary, I think much more in Austria. So where exactly does it come from? The government? Or lower material costs due to state-subsidized agriculture? In Hungary a typical restaurant will spend around 30% of the sales price of food on material, I figure it cannot be much lower than that when you are selling a big schnitzel for €14, so not from that either.

Except it wasn't upvoted. And my critic of the uncivilized hateful bashing was downvoted. Not once. I had about 10 comments with an average of -5. The ""Fuck 'em"" was at +60. 

At some point in the universe, civilization is happening. Though it is hard to see with all the hate dominating.

&gt; there are people with strong sentiments in BOTH sides

I haven't seen them here on Reddit yet. Guess I should adjust my karma filter and dig at -70. Though I do think the European Rabbi conference that compared the ruling to the Holocaust is nuts. Quite similar to the idiots here on Reddit. In that respect you are right. I wasn't debating this fact.

But are you serious with this argument? Trying to excuse wrongdoing by pointing at some ""other side"". The other kid also did it? WTF? Are we in kindergarden? Are we on Fox News?

&gt; therefore would never censor a political stance on some subject

I am also against censorship. But I am very aware of the dangers of free speech as well as the dangers of censorship. In Germany we have a lot of self censorship by the news media, which is common in Europe and we also have strong censorship laws. While I am critical of both, I understand where this is coming from and I am not going balistic about it. I can disagree with a practice and find it bad. But I can keep my calm and not fall into hate speech.

&gt; but he will always have that mark in his body

That is stupid. ""mark upon his body"". This is a very close minded statement in itself. Anyone that is smart knows it is just a sign how someone was born and who his parents were. Just like any other physical feature such as dark skin. I hope we don't start judging people by that. 

&gt; doing it in the baby is a form of denying the future adult the ability to choose his religion for himself

So someone can't choose a religion, because they are circumcised? A part of the (civil) discussion that you seem to have missed was that a lot of commentators wrote that all parents make their ideological mark upon their children. And the implicit claim that you can't from an emancipated opinion yourself, if you have nothing to emancipate yourself from. 

But this is all besides the point.

&gt; I don't think criticizing religion and religious practices is in itself intolerant. I don't give religion a special status. If we can openly criticize politics, ideology and world-views, I don't see why religion should be different. The fact that the religion is a minoritary one does not seen relevant to me.

This is the problem. Because we don't live in a fairy tale pure world. We live in the real world and in this world everything has context. People don't criticize Islam, they bash Muslims. And the (sometimes unintended) target are the vast majority of liberal Muslims. Here and in other places. Muslims suffer under Islamophobia and are often poor immigrants and poor minorities. I don't need to start about the historical context and the Jews. But I can take a guess on how they feel about all this. 

People are so upset, because they are talking about something they don't know. The tradition is horrific to them, because it involves babies and penises and blood and everything. And they are not used to it. 

Classic case of xenophobia. And for some reasons the worst cases are upvoted.

true,vityok,UKRA,Ukraine,"&gt;  Are you saying that Tymoshenko ""orchestrated"" the crisis by buying gas when it should have been cheaper, or that she had some hand in the failed negotiations to pay for that gas?

Ukraine had to pay for the gas till the end of 2008. Thanks to President Yuschenko, Ukraine did pay for all the gas she already consumed and even for some gas in advance.

But then Tymoshenko intrudes one more time and bids additional volumes that can not be paid fore. This way she creates a debt and the old contracts become invalid. This is how the crisis began.

&gt; Is Ukraine not paying somewhere under $250 USD per thousand cubic meters right now?

No, [the price is higher](http://blogs.pravda.com.ua/authors/kushniruk/4ffee585ce1b6/). Ukraine paid 311,489$ per 1000 m³ in 2011 + 100$ for fleet means that the price of gas for Ukraine was 411$ per 1000 m³.

In the first 3 month of 2012 the price was 520$ per 1000 m³.

&gt; Tymoshenko solved a gas crisis which was threatening to tear not just Ukraine apart, but half of central Europe, and as a result she's been stuck in jail. It's crazy.

The crisis did not threaten to tear Ukraine apart. [Ukraine had enough reserves to last till spring or even longer](http://ukr-nationalism.livejournal.com/1790362.html). The crisis really threatened to tear Russian gas industry apart for they failed to deliver gas to their customers in Europe, and because they had to halt gas mining which is extremelly hard to do.

&gt;&gt; Ukraine never had such amounts of gas in her storage in the twenty years before. In the case of full blockade of gas supplies from Russia *Ukraine could meet her needs for at least until the end of April 2009*, and in case of putting austerity — several months more.

Tymoshenko did not solve the crisis at all. Instead, she has betrayed Ukraine into slavery to Gasprom. The worst part in the contracts are not even the 500$ price for gas, the worst part is the ""take-or-pay"" clause: Ukraine must pay 300% for the gas she does not consume. And the mandatory is quota is much higher than Ukraine really needs, especially at this price.

Therefore: the contracts are criminal as they are. There is probably a case for treason. But Tymoshenko is accussed of, and found guilty of **abusing and overstepping her powers** (a criminal deed in almost all european countries).",0,1342438804,null,0,false,0,c5epq2k,t3_wl77e,t1_c5epq2k,t1_c5epf20,null,1429388484,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Je crois que cette question résume le problème.

Le fait est que l'on peut difficilement contrôler ce genre de tendances : internet, comme le dit Warven, c'est par définition une culture internationale. L'entrée d'un nouveau mot dans la culture française est incontrôlable, étant donné que tout se passe sans frontières. Une nouvelle tendance lancée en anglais (Minecraft, Twitter, Foursquare ou encore Github pour les geeks...) sera généralement d'abord suivie par les français anglophones, qui n'auront souvent d'autre choix que d'adopter le vocabulaire anglais (creeper, tweet, check in, pull request...). Une fois ce vocabulaire ancré chez eux, difficile de changer les choses vu que c'est souvent eux qui vont populariser ces tendances.

Une autre stat intéressante de ce même sondage, c'est que 85% des français considèrent que la transmission de la mémoire de la Shoah est est importante (50% ""très importante"", 35% ""plutôt importante"").

The U.S. is the only country that was condemned for international terrorism by the World Court and that rejected a Security Council resolution calling on states to observe international law. It continues international terrorism. ...  Everybody here was quite properly outraged by the Oklahoma City bombing, and for a couple of days, the headlines all read, Oklahoma City looks like Beirut. I didn’t see anybody point out that Beirut also looks like Beirut, and part of the reason is that the Reagan Administration had set off a terrorist bombing there in 1985 that was very much like Oklahoma City, a truck bombing outside a mosque timed to kill the maximum number of people as they left. It killed eighty and wounded two hundred, aimed at a Muslim cleric whom they didn’t like and whom they missed. It was not very secret. I don’t know what name you give to the attack that’s killed maybe a million civilians in Iraq and maybe a half a million children, which is the price the Secretary of State says we’re willing to pay. Is there a name for that? Supporting Israeli atrocities is another one. Supporting Turkey’s crushing of its own Kurdish population, for which the Clinton Administration gave the decisive support, 80 percent of the arms, escalating as atrocities increased, is another. Or take the bombing of the Sudan, one little footnote, so small that it is casually mentioned in passing in reports on the background to the Sept. 11 crimes. How would the same commentators react if the bin Laden network blew up half the pharmaceutical supplies in the U.S. and the facilities for replenishing them? Or Israel? Or any country where people “matter”? Although that’s not a fair analogy, because the U.S. target is a poor country which had few enough drugs and vaccines to begin with and can’t replenish them. Nobody knows how many thousands or tens of thousands of deaths resulted from that single atrocity, and bringing up that death toll is considered scandalous. If somebody did that to the U.S. or its allies, can you imagine the reaction? In this case we say, Oh, well, too bad, minor mistake, let’s go on to the next topic. Other people in the world don’t react like that. When bin Laden brings up that bombing, he strikes a resonant chord, even with people who despise and fear him, and the same, unfortunately, is true of much of the rest of his rhetoric.

It is your damn responsibility to justify a surgery, not the parent's.

* Brichals: Why, little Kevin's XYZ seems to be perfectly fine, and he'll need it for Mütze Glatze Mütze Glatze, if ya know what I mean.

To-go food is everywhere. Walk down any major street in Paris and you'll find a panini place. There's also McDonalds, if you get super desperate.

Cigarette butts are everywhere. Seriously.

I don't know about August normally, but as I'm sitting in Paris now, in mid-July, its only low 70s. This summer has sucked weather wise- cold, rain, bleh. So while you can totally walk around on foot if its nice out, you might want to look into a metro pass just in case, and make sure to bring an umbrella.

Other things to know- a lot of public bathrooms require you to pay, maybe 50 cents, and the ones that don't are normally disgusting. Make sure you go before leaving a restaurant or any kind of attraction where it will be free. Also, they sell map books here that are really helpful. I got mine for about 9 euros and I can search for any street in Paris or La Defense and get a detailed map of the arrondissement, and it has a metro and RER map in it. It might be worth the investment if you do plan on walking around a lot. Especially considering you don't speak French, so asking for directions might be harder than just looking at the map yourself.

The appointment on the 'convocation' said to be there for 13h30.  I went closer to 12h.  The office is actually closed from 12h to 13h (if I recall correctly), but the official just inside the door said that I should come line up outside the door at 12h45 because about a hundred people have the same appointment time.  I wandered around and decided to buy the 'timbres' (349€ + 19€) at a tabac just across the street.  Wandered back at 12h45 and was second in line.  By 12h55, there were about a hundred people behind me.  They let us in about 13h31.  Once inside, you go up to the 1st floor and a secretary will direct you either to another line, or the medical waiting room.  Since I had an employer-sponsored visa, I was directed straight to the medical waiting room (same floor, basically down the hall).  Give your 'convocation' to the secretary there and wait.  I had brought my passport, vaccination booklet, etc., but nobody looked at anything.  Instead, I waited for five minutes, saw the first doctor who asked me a few questions, rushed me through height and weight measurements and quick eye exam, saw next doctor for chest x-ray, saw last doctor for review of x-ray and follow-up questions.  The three doctors totalled less than 10 minutes.  Then you wait in the waiting room while they sign your approved medical certificate - again this took about a minute - and finally walk down the corridor (again, same floor, just around the corner) to the 'prefecture' to pick up your titre de séjour, assuming you have your passport and timbres.  All in all, it was an easy process, everyone was helpful (even through my muddled French), and the longest I waited was just to get in the building.  Show up 45 minutes early, and you're good.  Also, I also had no idea what to expect before going, and didn't even realize I could pick up the titre at the same time.
