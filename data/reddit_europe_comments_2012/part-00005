England did invade Scotland on numerous occasions in the past, but that's not really the issue.

A partnership works best when it's a partnership of equals. England has 10x the population of Scotland, so is always going to dominate politically and economically. The interests of the English people will always come first, and they will always choose the party that runs Westminster. Nothing wrong with that as such - it's a democracy - but even with devolution, the Scots will always be the underdogs in the relationship.

Devo max doesn't give the Scots control over foreign policy. Given that Scottish soldiers have been deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, that's no small thing. It would have full negotiating powers at the EU table - for example over fishing rights. 

That said, devo max would be a better long term course - a stepping stone to full independence. Right now there are so many unanswered questions on everything from border controls to currency to EU membership that will take years to resolve, before we should even have the referendum.

Now one can't imagine the UK vetoing Scotlands entry to the EU, but if things turned sour over negotiating oil field rights, one can now suddenly see the remaining UK using it as a point of negotiation. I'm also very sure that the remaining UK could muster up a veto or two elsewhere in the EU, say from Poland if it were necessary.

It's a tricky game here that has been started, and calls of ""FREEEEDOM!"" aren't going to win the day.

Also what will factor in over the next couple of years, as any jilted lover might react... The English people might quickly move toward ""fuck 'em then, kick them out""

The English will not negotiate to any position that is not to their advantage... it is horrifyingly naive to think that Scotland will get to write a script called ""My Best Day Ever"" and simply have it unfold thus.

Anti-English and Scottish sentiment will build upon both sides, and cynical politicians will build upon this to distract from other problems.

If Sctoland makes it's way to independence, it will be with the butt end of any oil in order to get into the EU... If the UK is prepared to participate in Iraq and Afghanistan over oil interests and the death of 10s of thousands of innocent civilians, again you are naive if you think oil will simply be handed over so close to home. If England says ""mine"", there is nobody to enforce a different position.

Great preassure will be brought to bear on Scottish financial institutions and London will look for the first opportunity to rape Edinburgh.

The worst case scenario... and again I don't think this likely... is that most anything of significance ends up owned by London, and the Scottish get to take care of themselves with a BBB credit rating and bond yields climbing... because all the rhetoric on the SNP side relies on the fiction that they will wind up with significant revenue from oil.

I think this is a high risk play from the Scottish side of things, but at my most cynical as an Englishman I think this a splendid idea.

As mentioned in another comment, a lot countries in the EU are dealing with sepratist movements, and I would not rely upon the EU being sympathetic to sepratists at the moment. It would see several other regions using Scotland as a precedent, and for that reason alone I think Scotland is going to find the degree of support the remaining UK recieves quite shocking.

Please when considering this don't assume that entry to the EU is a pre-given. If London opposes it, it's not happening inside a decade from split. The least London can achieve is talks about talks.

Its utterly deplorable, and truthfully I want no part of a superstate which doesn't respect the will of its citizens.

This isn't a superiority complex or any such thing: I *know* for a fact that the UK Parliament, for all its problems, is at least properly accountable to its electorate. The EU is just ridiculous in this regard and  I am fundamentally opposed to giving any powers to a body such as this.

Until the leaders of the large nations agree to fundamentally alter the power balance so the executive is drawn from the European Parliament and change the ways the party blocks work the EU will never function correctly.

Sarkozy and Merkel should have **no** business deciding matters which are an issue for the entire Eurozone; they should be decided by the elected MEPs of those countries in the Euro. An executive Government should be drawn from the parliament and this Government should appoint Ministers who have control over this shit.

For a start the nationally elected leaders have a *lot* of power. Far more than the Parliament. Then you have the commissioners; they're appointed behind close doors in agreements between national governments, not elected.

Then the MEPs themselves: the parties they belong to are different nation to nation, yet they're aligned in groups which *again* we have no control over.

For instance, I'm British and would like to vote for the Pirate Party, but there isn't really a very good British equivalent. I can vote for the Liberal Democrats, which belong to one of the centre left groupings, *but* I have absolutely no control over that group itself. Again, the negotiations over how its run and decisions are made are all done behind closed doors and again the largest countries control the parties more or less.

In a national democracy you get the chance to change the direction of a party every time there's a leadership election, in the European Parliament you have absolutely no control over what each grouping does.

Its utterly ridiculous.

And yes, there was plenty of reason to block the EU Constitution. I refuse to put my vote to a treaty which claims to be a ""Constitution"" but has such incredible lack of democratic legitimacy.

Profix says,

""Not a super power anymore,""

An obvious truth that applies as much to Holland's diminished status since Holland lost control of the spice trade as it does to the UK.

A truth so obvious that whenever anyone alludes to it we have a pretty good idea of what is to follow.

""Not a nation with industry anymore.""

A perception as widespread among the thick and unwashed as it inaccurate, which I treated with perhaps less contempt than it deserved.

Profix continues with nothing more than abuse that is as cheap as it is muddled.  To quote:

""Need to cuddle up to a world power to survive, and in that case fuck the americans, frankly.""

Profix has no knowledge of the well placed influence the Brits contributed to the US decision not to let their General MacArthur use nuclear weapons against the Chinese during the Korean war,

No knowledge of the support MacMillan gave Kennedy in extricating everyone from that stupid Cuban missile crisis balls up,

And that the British General Mike Jackson refused a direct order from his American superior in refusing to order British troops to attack the Russian special forces that had snaffled Pristina military airport during the Kosovo crisis.

The result of that being, Kosovo did not get out of hand, the American General Wesley Clarke got replaced soon afterwards and the British General Jackson, went on to the top job at the British military. 

You probably don't know anything about those three points either.

But what they show is that Profix is talking rot and you are a fool for taking it seriously.

* Council of Europe (the leaders and ministers of each country) becoming the Upper House of a bicameral parliament

* The current European Parliament becoming the lower house. Controlled by a Prime Minister that commands a majority. Proposes legislation that is sent to the Upper House.

This it seems would be a nice compromise between the confederate (largely undemocratic) system we have now and a full federation like the US by preserving state power as the upper house but also providing for directly elected MEPs that propose legislation. A President to oversee the whole malarky but that is there to preside not to propose.

I choose my words on this point advisedly.

It is a fundamental bulwark of English freedom, something the English have a tradition, taste and knack for.

If other nations have less of an attachment to the jury system that is a matter for them.

true,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"&gt; If other nations have less of an attachment to the jury system that is a matter for them.

We have lay judges to rule alongside with equal voice as the the career judges in high(er)-profile cases. As judges, they can actually be held accountable for their rulings, as opposed to a jury... or has a jury ever been convicted of perversion of the law? We once had juries in some cases too, but having unaccountable people decide the fate of another is incompatible with our post-war notion of rule of law, and also with old Germanic law. Law is a matter of applying the rules, it's not the place to play democracy. That's a thing for the legislative, not the judiciary.

&gt; Obviously there are no German ones and sadly none Scottish anywhere near the top,

Universities in Germany teach, they don't research much beyond what's useful for teaching, which makes them of course abysmal by Anglo-American standards. Which, in turn, makes the methodology of those Anglo-American comparisons even more abysmal. Believe it or not, but much research is actually done by the courts themselves, even though there's no concept of binding precedence.

...the top ranking German University by that ranking, the HU Berlin, definitely ranks behind Passau and Heidelberg by German standards. So much for accuracy.

Then, of course, those Universities churn out lawyers and judges (and those with bad marks become politicians, *sigh*), to work within Germany, then some EU law and to a way lesser degree international law. They graduate with a [Staatsexamen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staatsexamen), so don't be surprised if you compare the number of doctorates, and by German standards it's perfectly fine if a university does nothing but enable its student to pass that exam. It's hard enough as it is, no need to go all celebrity-professorships about it.

Taking another perspective, you may or may not be surprised that 50% of the worldwide output of text and research about tax codes is in German. This, however, just reflects the incomprehensibly complex tax system that's in urgent need of a complete overhaul... so, by bijection, the reason that US and UK universities churn out the most law research (with Commonwealth countries being close) just proves that common law is ridiculously over-complex and in utter need of a complete overhaul. *Like by fucking codifying your law*.",0,1326654995,null,0,false,0,c3hgtlp,t3_ohdcf,t1_c3hgtlp,t1_c3hg67o,null,1428184763,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

it's about the opposition getting people in the street to march and generally be hooligans, like they've been trying to ever since the current president has been elected.

Tell you what: poverty, corruption, joblessness? empty promises? general shittiness of the country? please. We've had it waaaay worse than it is at the moment. Believe it or not, we're doing ok, and things seem to be getting generally better. Sure, some people in the public system are getting screwed because the system was built upon connections/nepotism. and a lot of people find themselves at the moment with being unemployed while the government tries to cut the spendings.

Tell you what the protest is ""about"" though. The current government is trying to change the healthcare system. For good reasons too, and you'd know this if you ever been in a romanian hospital. (I've actually been quite recently, like last year, for a pneumothorax. Believe it or not, there were bugs crawling at night, the sheets were all tore and stained, the rooms were shitty as fuck and the doctor doesn't care unless you shove 100 euro down his throat).

So the current government tries to change that by privatizing the health care system. Which would hopefully mean better conditions (honestly, they can't be much worse).

This would not really be a problem if a doctor who currently has monopoly over an ambulancy system wouldn't have spoken out against it. Now the thing is, he's done a lot of good for this country, sure. But the party in power invited him to talks and whatnot, and he just refuses to even consider taking part in changing the bill (aparently). Now, the opposition just speculated on this to bring people out into the street and make a fucking ruckus, for no good reason. People interviewed there don't even know why they're there for, or what they support.

If you want a good healthcare system, you need to start this way:

* **depoliticize** and decentralize the system: everything is now run by the government's corrupt bureaucrats. The first thing that a new government does is to replace everyone who has even a modicum of power with its own incompetent minions.

In essence they are using the momentum of the previous rally to air their grievances, albeit it has since become violent and to some people it may seem as ridiculous. 

I still stand by what I said in my previous comment, because it is in fact true. Do you seriously think that by privatizing every facet of government system leads to a better one? Not necessarily, especially in the case of healthcare. Should those people who can't afford treatment be left in the gutters? In theory the current system should treat anyone, but in reality as you mentioned it isn't like that. But the solution is not to privatize, but to reform it in a way that doesn't discriminate anyone. But how can you do that when every politician who has ever opened their mouth in that country has stolen in every which way possible besides, they only serve their own interests and the interests of their pals.

1. But, however, nevertheless, still, yet  are words implying opposition (with a possible concession). But  marks an opposition or contrast, though in a casual way: We are going, but we shall return. However  indicates a less marked opposition, but displays a second consideration to be compared with the first: We are going; however  ( “notice this also” ), we shall return. Nevertheless  implies a concession, something which should not be forgotten in making a summing up: We are going; nevertheless  ( “do not forget that” ), we shall return. Still  implies that in spite of a preceding concession, something must be considered as possible or even inevitable: We have to go on foot; still  ( “it is probable and possible that” ), we'll get there. Yet  implies that in spite of a preceding concession, there is still a chance for a different outcome: We are going; yet  ( “in spite of all, some day” ), we shall return. 2. See except1 .

January: nothing interesting will happen

February: Serbia and Kosovo will work out a series of agreements under the EU pressure. This is just a first in the series of agreements of a *de facto* recognition of Kosovo as a sovereign nation. 

March: as a reward for the agreements, the EU finally awards Serbia an EU candidate status. A huge score for the ruling party, which hopes to win the elections the following month. The new Fiat [El Zero](http://www.b92.net/automobili/vesti.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=12&amp;nav_id=562032) car, the first real new car to come out of Kragujevac factory after 40 years is presented to the public, and the production details are announced.

April is the parliamentary election month. Fake promises as always. Thanks to the EU and Fiat, the current ruling party wins the elections once again. The President announces the presidential election date. 

May is my birthday :D but really, nothing interesting

June is marked by yet another series of violence in Kosovo. Serbia insists that both sides calm down and makes several arrests. Public support for Kosovo is at a historically low level and keeps dropping. This prompts the government to reevaluate the stance towards Kosovo and to ask themselves if 40.000 Serbs living down there are really worth 1 billion € sent there every year as aid money.

July the EU gives Serbia negotiation date. 

August nothing interesting happens.

September the presidential race warms up. Again fake promises etc.

November the first results from FIAT production are coming in. Serbian exports are up by 10% year-on-year, the city of Kragujevac is no longer ""the valley of hunger"" (well it hasn't been for a while now, I'm from the city). The economy grows as the inflation goes down. Dinar is again the region's [most stable currency](http://www.b92.net/eng/news/business-article.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=13&amp;nav_id=77766). In the meantime, there's a presidential election race, and the current president Boris Tadic yet again emerges as a winner. 

December meh, nothing interesting really.

You can only get a working permit visa in your country of origin (yes that means going back to Canada if you're already there thanks to a temporary visa) and you probably can only get that if you already have a job offer.

Serbs down there were always demanding special treatment. They claimed they were being threatened by the Albanians. Billions and billions went down there in the 1980s - for example, no one there paid for water, electricity, they would get jobs insanely easily, etc. Meanwhile, the moment they would get an opportunity, they would sell their houses to Albanians and move to Serbia. When in Serbia, they would yell how ""Kosovo is Serbian holy land"" and how ""we should fight for it"". Fuck you, take a gun and go fight for it then. 

Today's government *admitted* spending 600 million € per year on Kosovo, in reality it's probably like 1 billion. One billion euros is our fiscal deficit for the year.

The extra minority rights that they have are within the jurisdiction of the provintial government and these rights extend quite a bit. This is partly why the same rights do not exist on the republic level. Another reason is because giving Vlahs those rights would mean giving Albanians the same right - something which would perhaps be considered a bad political move.

All that being said, however, all of those minorities still enjoy all the rights - it's just that Vojvodina has some more rights for the minorities. This is because only 65% of people in Vojvodina are Serbs ([here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vojvodina#Demographics))

ProxTube sollte nun wirklich wieder bei jedem funktionieren, ich habe die Server wieder im Griff und werde in den nächsten 2 Wochen Updates für beide Browser herausbringen womit besonders die Firefox Version noch einige zusätzliche Features bekommen wird.
Außerdem hat ProxTube ab sofort ein neues Logo, welches natürlich 
dann auch mit den Updates in den Addons selbst integriert wird!
Solltet ihr trotzdem noch vereinzelt Probleme haben und die Fehlermeldung bekommen, wir würden ein ungültiges Sicherheitszertifikat verwenden, habt ihr zwei Möglichkeiten entweder noch ein paar Stunden gedulden, denn wir haben keinen Einfluss darauf, oder den DNS Cache leeren, dies wird z.B. im folgenden Artikel sehr ausführlich erklärt: http://www.tippscout.de/windows-dns-cache-loeschen_tipp_2292.html

[Das](https://www.facebook.com/ProxTube) ist die passende Facebookseite, ich hoffe es klappt bei dir, bei mir tut es das.

As a comparison, this is her translation of the text: ""En mi opinión es más fácil ver el encanto de un lugar gastando allí sólo un período corto del tiempo. Cada pequeña cosa como la reunión de la nueva gente o descubrimiento de nuevos sitios puede ser una inspiración para escribir un libro. Por otra parte, después de gastar un período largo del tiempo allí usted tiende a descubrir las partes negativas del lugar, usted rápidamente se aburre con los alrededores y toda la magia desaparece. Fuertemente creo que es realmente importante no para olvidar las cosas que una vez le hicieron feliz de vivir en aquel país.

&gt;Montmartre looks stunning but is a bit too far out

Too far out from what ? It's Paris you're speaking of, not Los Angeles. It's *very* difficult to be more than 25 minutes away from pretty much anything *inside* of Paris.
Montmartre is *extremely* central.

Apart from that, it seems to me you have some fantasy idea of Paris from novels, or films, or something... In short, the Paris you expect doesn't exist. It *may* have existed (possibly) at a time, but it just doesn't any more.

So... taking each point in turn :  

- beautiful and traditional  

Actually, European cities don't have a centre and suburbs. Paris (like most European cities) has numerous areas, all of which can be though of as little villages. They all have their ""flavour"", their traditions, their history, sometimes going back several hundred of years (where several is ten or twenty).

- young, vibrant and not touristy

Yes, but...  
Touristy... What are you then ?   
Anyway. ""Young"". All places are young. And old. And everything in between. Although it may depend on the time of the day. The same may be said for ""vibrant"". And then it may depend on the kind of vibration you're looking for.

While certainly are some specialists somewhere around here that could write books about this, since I've never heard of Coachella (I looked it up, you *really* expect us to know of some obscure CA festival ?), and find it rather bizarre to offer it as a reference to Parisians, I'll just pass.

I was last there in September, but that was with work so I didn't get to explore as much as I'd have liked. We'll be on our honeymoon so, to be honest, we could spend the time anywhere and I'd love it. I just think it would be helpful to get some tips on romantic, quaint areas and bars/clubs that tend to be popular with young people who like bands like Beirut, Arcade Fire, The Doors, James Brown etc.

I'm not expecting our stay to be like something out of Amelie. I'm just asking if anyone can recommend areas that might be suited to our interests. As you say, each area has unique flavours, and there's some areas that I know wouldn't suit us. I stayed in Arrondissement 14 in September and it was very modern and pretty souless, so I know I wouldn't want to stay there on our honeymoon. 

I referenced Coachella because lots of the people in this subreddit seemed to be (and I'm likely to be wrong here) American expats.

France and Germany will be speared by two new heads of state, even less willing to compromise in light of crippling bailouts and their political frailty. This means no agreements and no federalization. It's a terrible scenario that will unfold by the end of 2012 and into 2013. More and more economic depression and the dissolution of the old EU into a smaller northern core, still with the Euro. Southern countries will be forced to reintroduce their old currencies and partially default on their debt. It will mean very hard times for the south. Prices will soar and our economies will take a &gt;50% hit. 

In the US, Obama wins the reelection but remains tied by Congress and other interests. There will be another bubble bursting - student loans; and string of bailouts due to European debt exposure. I doubt Bank Of America survives 2012 along with the dollar as it currently stands. 

A war with Iran is a near certainty. Iran doesn't stand a chance and will be forced into submission either by Israel alone or by the US. This will make some commodities soar and countries topple in Europe. 

China will experience a real estate bubble and a slowing of its industrial output as well as growth but will remain in control of it. It's a rigid political system ruling over a submissive people already used to authoritarian regimes. China will invest in southern Europe making scooping up bargain after bargain in the newly privatized energy sectors. 

In Portugal I foresee even more austerity along with the usual politician's hypocrisy, as our government continues its corrupt favoring of the elite few. Unemployment will hit 20% (which really means 40%) and starvation will happen. More and more people will turn to farming. Regular clashes regarding tax dodging and parallel economies will occur with the police. The current right winged ministers are prone to exert violence over the population and that will happen often as it did in the past. There will mass protesting but crushed by the police. Most people will eventually give up and many young will emigrate to BRICS and former colonies. Some banks will go bust. Health and Social Security will be fully privatized. A military coup might be discussed but will be crushed.

I'm getting the feeling that they'll just keep on downgrading whatever happens, until there's nothing left to downgrade. While they might have a point, they aren't all-knowing either (see: Lehman Brothers). So why is it occurring to me that the future of the EU is hinging on the advice of some American institutions? Given the panicky behavior of investors and market speculators in general, any bad news will automatically cause *more* bad news down the line I'm afraid. So in a way, the rating agencies create little self-fulfilling prophecies which kick the EU back down each time it tries to right itself, never giving it the chance to right the wrongs it failed to draw up when it formed.

By expanding the Parliament's power, Danes start making decisions on the most important issues that ultimately affects Slovaks, Austrians in part determine the course that Portugal will take etc. This is where the problem arises. Europeans still largely think in nationalist manners, and the prospect of the above is met with suspicion. Confederacy is the name of the game for now, and it will take some time for the citizens of the EU and the major parties of member states to warm to the idea of empowering EU institutions rather than continuing with intergovernmental governance.

The French, specifically Sarkozy's UMP, are major proponents of intergovernmental governance.

&gt;Briefly put, if the UK joins EMU (Case 4), the euro becomes the dominant currency.  The only UK-in scenario in which it does not is when 20-year trend depreciation is assumed to drop to zero, which begins with an immediate jump in the dollar’s value in 2005.  If currency trends of the recent past persist (Scenario D), the euro not only gains dominance, but does so rapidly – by 2019.

It's five years old though, so opportunities have changed. Still, if the pound devalues enough relative to the euro, an entrance will become more and more attractive.

Ok enough joking. Your German is quite ok actually, should at least help you getting along. Grammar and stuff is of course not perfect but the people will understand and try to help you. And you should always be able to fall back to English if it does not work out. In the big cities which are usually attracting many tourists, English should not be a problem among most of the German inhabitants and if you are out of luck you should easily find someone who can translate for you. But don't expect our English skills to be as good as in the Scandinavian region for example.

On one of my trips there last summer I visited a NATO/Finland Naval exercise, where NATO and Finland's Navy did some joint exercises. The people I spoke to said that NATO and Finland have started doing exercises together, mostly because it takes a good while to integrate properly into the NATO military structure, and since Finland may well join before 2015, it's wise to start the integration training now.

Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of Finns who still distrust the west, and also a lot who fear Russia enough to not want to join NATO - but I think increasingly among the young, perhaps a product of EU membership, there's this feeling of integration with the west which didn't exist 30 years ago, and so a consideration that perhaps just finally becoming NATO members might be the answer to every problem which contains the word ""Russia"" - of which Finland has many.",0,1326762696,null,0,false,0,c3hw685,t3_ojxjq,t1_c3hw685,t1_c3hvljw,null,1428192252,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Pre-WW2 they thought the Swedes and Norwegians were on their side, then the Winter War kicked off and the Swedes, whilst helping in material terms, refused to actually do any fighting to help their neighbour. Then the UK declared war on them. After WW2 was over, the Finns had the US and western Europe on one side, and the USSR to the east and south. They were surrounded on all sides by people they weren't sure of. They were smart to be unsure - both sides had plans, in the event of war, to nuke the hell out of Finland. Finland persued a policy of not antagonising anyone, but obviously Russia is harder not to antagonise because Russia is more childish and aggressive than the US is, marginally at least. Finland persued this policy of not pissing off Russia for around 40 years, and the Russians got used to being able to make demands of a scared Finland. Where-as the baltic states never got used to being scared of losing their independence. They didn't have it, then they did, then very soon after they were in NATO. There was never any real risk to them of losing sovereignty. They joined before the rerise of Russia. Russia is rising again though, at least to an extent - and with the Ottawa treaty meaning that Finland can't mine the fuck out of their massive border with Russia, they once again seem to feel slightly worried about this behemoth next to them - and what might happen if the world got into enough turmoil that once again, not even Sweden would bother to help.",0,1326763500,null,0,false,0,c3hwb7i,t3_ojxjq,t1_c3hwb7i,t1_c3hw8pr,null,1428192321,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

&gt; No.

Right, I forgot this. I was really baffled by the fact for months, that they didn't get downgraded, when it suddenly happened.

&gt; It tells more about the insecurity of all the other investment possibilities in the market.

Not so sure about that. Our current government is really good in making itself look like the saviour of the world and making others look like shit. That tactic has paid off for us in the medium term, enabling us to start paying off our own huge pile of debts.

But I am not sure what happens in the long run, because Germany depends a lot on how our neighbors are doing.

&gt; Did the AAA-rated germany just got a bunch of loans with negative interest?

The ECB joined the Feds strategy to give out cheap money (we are on 1% for a little over a month now). The idea was to allow markets to have more money to invest in businesses and in bonds of countries that previously had high interest rates. But since you can't tell bankers what to do with the money, they invested it like it made most sense to them.

It really helped those countries in trouble, but not only them. Now Germany has extremely low interst rates. I recently read that the absolute interest we had to pay last year was on the same level as 1993, even though we now have more than 3 times the debts (I hope the number is right, but it is roughly around that amount). And that is likely to go down. This (amoung other factors of course, like a stable economy) allowed us to have a 1% deficit last year.

So, whatever measures have been taken until now, they were designed to help everyone, not only those in trouble. But in my opinion we need to concentrate on those in trouble to be able to solve the crisis. Of course that will hurt Germany, but only in a way that takes away advantages that Germany should not have and does not need.",0,1326789798,null,0,false,0,c3i0djz,t3_ojnnv,t1_c3i0djz,t1_c3i05wx,null,1428194302,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

First, Catalonia's situation is not analogous to Scotland. 

Second Catalonia's parliament does not have the power to make such a referendum, if made (and it has been done before) it is not vinculative and the people know it, so the ones that get out of their homes to vote are the heavy catalan nationalists, so the results of these referendums are not only not vinculative, they do not represent the hypothetical result of a real referedum.

Third, there are a lot more of pragmatical reasons why Catalonia's independence is not going to happen, but I've had this discussion many many times and you as a true Catalan will not agree with me in any of those, and that is ok with me and I understand where you are coming from, so it is really not worth discussing them ;)
