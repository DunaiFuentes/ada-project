* A nice simple Longchamps book bag is what I use, and it's quite popular at the moment. It's not too expensive and it can even fit my laptop.

The German HQ of Microsoft is in Unterschleißheim, near Munich. 

Munich has 2 Universities and 1 Fachhochschule: 
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München
Technische Universität München
Hochschule München

Additionally, one of the 2 universities of the Bundeswehr (where armed forces officers study) is near Munich. 

There are also research institutes, e.g. Max-Planck-Institut für Physik in Munich might need EEs. In Garching (near Munich) are 2: Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics and Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics. There are also some Fraunhofer institutes in/near Munich. 
Fraunhofer and Max-Planck-Society are the largest and most important research societies in Germany. 


As already mentioned, you have to have at least a Master or Staatsexamen to teach at a school in Germany, Bachelor degrees are not accepted. You might get a teaching job at a international school, but you will not be recognized as a full teacher for legal reasons. 

However, universities also need English teachers and they often accept native speakers who hold at least a B.A./B.Sc. There are also English courses for soldiers, but I don't know if they are taught in Munich or Hamburg and if the teachers are NATO soldiers or not. 

Besides that, large companies also offer English courses, maybe BMW, Microsoft, Munich Airport or other companies hire (freelance) teachers. 

But keep in mind, Munich is one of the economic powerhouses of Germany, living there is *really* expensive and you are just one of many, many Americans (and other native speakers) living there, so being a native speaker is not a unique feature. Your teacher's degree might help, a TEFL certificate will further improve your chances. 

Maybe you should also consider other towns to live in, e.g. Ingolstadt is only 80Km north of Munich and the HQ and largest facility of Audi.

Pour ce qui est du nucléaire, il s'agit d'une décision politique faite après la seconde guerre mondiale.

Le choix a été renforcé lors de la crise pétrolière dans les années 70 : l'importation de pétrole n'était pas la solution. Le Québec a la chance d'avoir un potentiel hydroélectrique énorme et de pouvoir produire quasiment toute son électricité ainsi. Ce n'est pas le cas de la France qui profite déjà de quasiment toutes les possibilités hydroélectriques en France métropolitaine. Même en développant les énergies renouvelables, il faut donc pouvoir produire une énorme quantité d'électricité de manière quasi-continue.

true,Asyx,NRWW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"No chance with English teaching, I'm afraid. 

I can't talk for Bavaria (why do you want to live there by the way?) but in my state, the books are all focused on British English. That means that you probably would have a hard time if you can't speak and write BBC English (that's basically a RP accent and the typical British writing rules). 

We also have mostly teachers with a Master of Education and I know people who actually left the queue for a place at a university to study English in the UK because the waiting times are ridiculously long sometimes. That would make them to ""Quereinsteigern"" which means that you start from nothing to everything. They throw you into a 30 or 40 hour week without help. You've got to manage ever class and prepare for it immediately. Normal German students have 2 years with 10-15 hours per week as training time. You could probably get your M.Ed in the UK to do the rest of your training here but I don't think that works for Americans (especially because your school system is so much different from ours but the British one isn't). 

Also, you MUST speak German at a German school. You can have an accent but your German has to be fluid. Pupils will not speak English with you if they don't have to and they don't have to most of the time. You'll never hear a word from bad students and you can't even be sure that the good ones understand you because, as I said, the pupils are used to BBC English and will have problems with another accent. 

Also, if you don't get your ""Beamtenstatus"", you'll earn half of the normal teacher payment as far as I know. A math teacher left my college (college is a school here in Germany) because of that. 

For your husband... Well... He won't have problems with English speaking companies. Especially not because he worked for MS which isn't a small company. As far as I know, engineers and computer scientists are the best paid jobs you can get as a ""normal worker"" in the industry. Of course you can get a promotion to a department leader and earn more but I'm talking about the jobs everybody with a degree can get. By the way, degrees are important in Germany. I don't know how important that can be for your husband or if his experience is worth more than a degree.

So, I don't think it's too much of a stretch to suggest that the coup was backed by the US. 

All the things you mentioned do actually count as evidence. The problem is they're circumstantial evidence and not hard evidence.

People going down this line of reasoning need to look at the big picture.

1. In China, everything is cheaper. So being paid a couple dollars an hour is not terrible; in fact, the existence of those jobs creates a much better alternative than working in the fields.
2. Wages rise when there is a scarcity of labor. You can see that with Apple's supplier, Foxconn; wages have quadrupled in the past three years because there is demand for goods that translates into demand for workers. There's a lot of money pouring in from the West and companies are fighting over a limited amount of manpower to operate their factories and machines. Ironically, if you managed to put together a strong boycott of Chinese goods in support of the ""exploited"" Chinese worker, you'd end up hurting his bargaining position for higher wages.

Consumer advocacy is a feel-good motion. If you really want to help the little guy, go and find the best deal. Then, with the money you save, put it towards some organization that supports impoverished schools. In America at least, certain people will spend hundreds of dollars extra per year on organic, local, or fair trade goods. I work in Bulgaria with poor communities and a couple hundred dollars could go an enormous distance in helping dozens of students. How much difference do those hundreds of dollars make as a purchasing power vote?

Anyways, we are world citizens. So in response to:

&gt;But if you decide to buy a cheaper product from china (and cheaper is not always better) rather then from your local producer, then the company that employs you (or your family /friend) may have to close down which means losing your job.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;There is a difference between exploiting workers and paying them a living standard. (I understand that difference as I have worked in Africa.)

1. What is a ""living standard""? Purchasing power is different so they're not going to be paid as much as Europeans. They have food and shelter, and many factory workers send their extra money back home to support their families.
2. The average income of people in rural China is about $100/month. Without demand for Chinese manufacturing, companies like Foxconn wouldn't exist. The average Foxconn employee is on track to earn $700/month in 2013. (In fact, that is higher than Bulgaria, an EU country, where the average income is about $250/month.)

&gt;Whoever you give your money to - it is at the expense of somebody else. Your argument is going around in circles. You are in the end making a judgement call on who you feel deserves your money.

Of course it comes at the expense of someone else. You are suggesting to buy European over Chinese. That's giving Europeans money &amp; jobs at the expense of the Chinese. For most goods of equal quality, made-in-China is going to beat made-in-Europe/made-in-USA. So you pay extra... to support people living in countries with social safety nets.

&gt;I for one don't believe that I am benefiting Chinese/Developing countries workers if they are being exploited. IF their resources are being stolen from them .

That's a strawman. Of course no one wants to ride on the back of exploited workers. But they're not being exploited. I should use ""we"" because I'm Chinese and have connections there. People *want* these manufacturing jobs. [Thousands will line up](http://micgadget.com/21420/thousands-line-up-for-foxconns-jobs-in-zhengzhou/), because this sort of cheap manufacturing is a step forward from agriculture.

The demand from Westerners for cheap Chinese goods is what helps workers. [This article for example](http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/6708090/article-China-s-new-generation-getting-picky-about-factory-jobs) is about workers being able to choose where to work because factory owners - despite how much people want factory jobs - still have to compete to keep up with demand. That forces less competitive work environments - ones with worse pay or poorer conditions - to improve. If demand were to soften, workers would no longer have that bargaining power because you'd end up with huge demand for factory jobs but with factory owners not really motivated to compete for hiring.

&gt;Mybe you dont understand the economics involved or believe that stealing resources is doing them a favour. But like I said your argument is going around in circles.

Explain clearly how my argument is going in circles? I've laid it out for you and supplied sources, how Western demand for Chinese goods is a positive driver for the country's development that benefits the guy at the bottom.

Also, explain how we're ""stealing"" their resources? Cite a source for land being taken away from Chinese people to plant crops that Westerners buy *at their expense*, because that currently sounds like a fancy spin on saying that China exports agricultural goods.

Here's my bottom line: How does your approach - to purchase European goods over Chinese goods - help Chinese workers? After all, it was Western demand for Chinese goods that helped the country shift out an agrarian economy in the 1970s, and continue to shift towards industry/services today. The standard of living has skyrocketed as a result, and the continued demand is continuing that trajectory.",0,1338731656,null,0,false,0,c4vod9r,t3_uffel,t1_c4vod9r,t1_c4vnpte,null,1429057897,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Pour les centrales nucléaire, c'est parce que c'est un secteur où la France est numéro 1 mondial si je me trompe pas, d'où la réticence à se débarrasser du nucléaire, du reste se passer de ces centrales impliquerait (je pense) soit d'acheter l’électricité à l'étranger soit d'investir massivement dans l'exploitation d'autres sources d’énergie, mais il faudrait énormément de panneaux solaires,éoliennes, etc pour produire l'équivalent de ce qu'on produit maintenant avec le nucléaire, et l’énergie serait plus couteuse à produire, car en ce qui concerne le nucléaire (et en mettant le risque d'incident de coté), le rendement coût/quantité produite est très intéressant.
Mais il est aussi vrai que le parc des centrales nucléaires en France est vieillissant, et n'est pas forcement bien entretenu, ou pas autant qu'il le faudrait, ce qui fait qu'un incident reste probable.

true,AlmightyBaloo,null,null,"&gt; ça se résume à un ""ça ne se fait pas en france"" qu'on m'a souvent reproché.

Ce ""on"" me parait tout simplement avoir cédé à la simplicité et choisi une formule malheureuse pour justifier son propre comportement. 

Dans les 3 exemples que tu donnes, on ne peut absolument pas dire que ""ça ne se fait pas en France"".

Mon avis personnel sur les 3 exemples, et ma tentative d'interprétation logique de ce qu'on a pu te dire :

1- Je ne suis pas un grand bavard, donc, je m'arrête personnellement aux formules de politesse sauf cas exceptionnel. Mais ce n'est pas parce que je suis Français, juste parce que je ne suis pas bavard. Si tu as envie de bavarder, fais toi plaisir. 

Maintenant, peut-être aurait-il fallu être là pour vraiment juger. Peut-être que tu as fait quelque chose de très déplacé à ton insu, mais j'en doute. Peut-être que tu l'emmerdais sans t'en rendre compte et que tes amis l'ont vu. Qui sait... 

2- Je ne comprends pas le ""ça ne se fait pas en France"". Je l'interprète comme une mise en garde, peut-être cherchait-on juste à te protéger car effectivement, selon où tu te trouves, tu peux facilement recevoir un mauvais coup. A vrai dire, s'il n'y avait pas eu de victime, si par exemple ils étaient en train de caillasser un arrêt de bus vide, j'aurais compris, le jeu n'en aurait pas valu la chandelle. Mais s'il y a des gens qui se font plus ou moins aggresser, et surtout si tu as le gabarit pour, pour moi c'est ton devoir de citoyen de les arrêter.

Donc pour celui-là je vote : mauvaise communication, they were just waching out for you.

3- Plainly stupid. Après, encore une fois, peut-être que ce n'est pas sur le fond qu'on t'a repris (parce que oui, bien sûr que tu peux poser des questions dans la rue !) mais sur la forme, dans ta façon de demander. Si tu es trop familier avec les gens, cela peut être vu comme malpoli. J'ai du mal à me rendre compte de ce que tu pourrais faire qui serait malpoli sans que tu le réalises, mais on ne sait jamais. Et la seule chose que je vois qui pourrais justifier la remarque que ""ça ne se fait pas France"", c'est que tu sois vraiment trop familier avec les gens.

Pour résumer : tout se fait en France, c'est idiot de te dire le contraire. C'est donc soit de la mauvaise communication de la part de ceux qui t'entourent, soit une critique de ta façon de le faire, qui serait par exemple trop familière. C'est vrai que c'est quelque chose qui ne se fait pas trop en France et peut-être que les critères de familiarité ne sont pas les mêmes en France et au Québec. 

Et si tu le fais sans te rendre compte que c'est déplacé, tu l'omets de ce que tu nous dis, et personne ne comprend pourquoi on a bien pu te dire ça. 

Je suis bien sûr d'accord avec toutes les réponses données dans les commentaires. Mais attention : c'est toujours pareil quand on n'a qu'une version des faits, le point de vue de l'autre semble idiot. Comme je doute que *tous* les gens qui t'ont fait des remarques soient idiots, il y a anguille sous roche.

true,Turbomullet,NETH,The Netherlands,"The Major issue of the global financial system is exactly that it has become too large and complex to benefit seperate nations or let alone local economies. If you were to argue that this is a natural process of capitalisme useless to fight against with romantic ideas about souvereignity I would grant you that point of view because it's realistic, even though I do not agree with it. However the euro as a financial and economic system completely consumes the overal political and social systems of seperate nations without any good reason. And thats where it becomes a prestige project. Our borders are naturally disappearing through market globalisation and internet communication. But that is on a private and buisiness level, actually creating oppertunitys for the average joe. The big political machine does not like this and imposes this undemocratic, monolithic system under the banner of european unity and the disapearing of borders. Again, the french and the dutch voted against the european constitution, and I'm sure that if put to vote the euro would not have survived. There is no faith left in currency because there is no faith in these technocrats at the wheel of these big goverment systems , that alone should be proof that it does not work. A currency needs faith by the people who use it right? Also with your responce you completely avoid what I explained about the relation between law, politics and currency by whiping it off the table, reasoning that the same issues occur on smaller levels well duh. Ofcourse they do. With the euro and the unquestioned power of the european comission you are doing nothing more than taking the power to a place where you and me can't reach, as of now there is now way to hold the people in power responsible for their incompetence and greed, because the european commissions are unelected people with way too much power and personal interrests. That is total anti-free market thinking. That is communisme! 
that is also a natural political process driven the desire to unify and control large groups of people, wich in turn sparks a flame for anarchism and nationalism to flourish within grassroots movements, creating a void of trust to be filled by oppertunist, populists and xenofobia. Again it is the arrogance of the europhiles and the complete distance to what is important to the people of it's nations that is creating these movements, feeding of the injustice of billions and billions of tax euro's going anywhere but towards a nations local interessets while at the same time cutting money for education and wellfare because a bunch cowboys 'accidentally the economy'

It's more than the lack of correcting imbalances and fancy economic talk. It's about believing in the idea of building an economy upon oppertunity, trust and tangible value without forcing it through our mouths with shrude political games and empty rethorics.",0,1338737643,null,0,1338739011,0,c4vp74d,t3_ubype,t1_c4vp74d,t1_c4vnt8t,null,1429058288,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

This sounds a lot like a reuters article(bottom) that appeared MARCH 6, 2012. I think 200B is for Greece, 350B+ each for Spain/Italy and Portugal/Ireland,  some of which is over the next 5 years.

Also, the ecb supposedly gave 1T euros already, as reported on April 20, 2012:


WASHINGTON(CNNMoney) -- The European Central Bank has pulled out all the stops over the past few months to prevent a credit crunch by providing banks with €1 trillion in ultra-low cost financing.

-------------------
Reuters:


If Greece misses the March 20 payment without a deal in place, this would be seen as a disorderly default and could be taken as a sign that politicians have lost control of the euro. Investors might then target other weak euro zone countries.

Spain and Italy might require 350 billion euros in outside support to contain the fallout, the IIF said, while the cost of helping Ireland and Portugal could total 380 billion euros ***over five years***.

If the deal fell apart, the European Central Bank would suffer substantial losses because its estimated 177 billion euros ***exposure to Greece is over 200 percent of its capital base***, the IIF said.

The Romanian articles focus on Ancient and Modern (post 1918/1920-[Trianon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Trianon)) while the Hungarian articles focus on Medieval and early Modern times. That's because between the 11th and 20th centuries, Transylvania was ruled either by Hungary, Austria, Austria-Hungary, or it was an Ottoman vasal state with a Hungarian ruling class. On the other hand, the Romanian historiography focuses on the modern times, or the ancient times when it was a [Dacian area, or a Roman province](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacians), and can thus include it in the Romanian national narrative.

Another aspect is [Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Corvinus). He was of Romanian ancestry, therefore Romanians consider him Romanian. On the other hand, he was fully assimilated into the Hungarian nobility, and he was the king of Hungary, therefore Hungarians consider him Hungarian.

That means that the percentage of people working in the public sector is 17%. 

This figure includes all and every public sector employee, including public companies, municipalities, provinces and of course central government. I doubt that the OECD/ECB figures also include all these categories.

In addition, the 4.2 million figure for the total number of employed is probably an underestimate, because there is also a lot of people who are not officially working even if they are (so called ""black economy""). 

So, even if you ignore the three caveats (1. there were recent layoffs in the private sector which inflates the percentage of the public sector, 2. these numbers are probably more inclusive than the numbers of other countries, 3. the 4.2 million figure is probably too small),  that still leaves Greece at about the same percentage as Belgium, which I suppose is not that bad.

Another fun thing is that there's a cute Farmer's Market there the first Saturday of every month, so that could be cool if you're into living green and staying organic. Alameda is also close to a number of buses and within reasonable walking distance from the center of the city.

Triana and Los Remedios are also pretty nice, though they're on the other side of the river and might be further from the city's center (depending on how deep within the neighborhoods you live).

As for sites to check out, is there something in particular you're looking for? Barrio Santa Cruz is fun to wander through during the day, as it's made up of small, winding Spanish streets; there are also a number of Flamenco places hidden around there. If you're looking for bars/nightlife, the most popular spots are Calle Betis (along the river), Alameda, and la Alfalfa (a strip of bars near Barrio Santa Cruz). I always enjoy walking around la Isla de la Cartuja, which was the site of  the 1992 World Expo, though there isn't a whole much to do besides admire all of the old Pavilions; it's a great place to find time to yourself, since not many people utilize the space.

Aren't those the complaints made against young European tourists by every tourist destination in Europe?  For example, the New Yorker recently had an article about young British people going on vacation in Spain, and it portrayed them as the rowdiest, drunkest, most outrageous type of person you could encounter.  The locals in Spain made the same complaints that you did - they urinate in public, they are loud, they trash the place - but cannabis is not legal in Spain.

There seemed to be three causes of their bad behavior:

1.  An attitude that they should behave outrageously because they're on vacation and young: this is of course a self-fulfilling prophecy;

2.  Alcohol - lots of it, all the time;

3.  What seemed to an American like an absence of police or laws against public intoxication.  In the US, it is illegal to be drunk in public or even to walk in the street with an open alcoholic beverage, even a beer.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The same. I studied abroad in Madrid for both undergrad and law school. I currently live in Madrid (met my fiancé while studying abroad the first time in 2002... I've been a permanent resident and lawyer in Spain since 2007). Happy to answer anything or give advice, but be specific. 

In general?

Immerse yourself in something fan-fucking-tastic and confusing. You don't need a syllabus. That's the point.


Don't just hang out with your bros, and explore Madrid. They'll always be there to trade rounds with you, Spain won't. 


If you don't know Spanish, you will learn it if you're diligent and don't bro it up all the time. Hell, I was the worst in my group in 2002 for Spanish. Now I draft contracts in Spanish for IBEX companies and get 34 business days of vacation to spearfish in the Med. I get paid very little. But, I'm with Seneca and the other stoics: virtuous and simple life.  

Explore elsewhere. Both in Spain and abroad. Find out when local festivals. There are millions of webpages for Madrid. Flights (www.trabber.com), trains (www.renfe.com) and buses to other cities are cheap and well worth it (I also worked as a lawyer in BCN and loved the hell out of it). Go to Javea, Asturias, Málaga, Portugal, Italy, etc. 

Get lost, talk to a lot of random people. Don't be embarrassed about cultural differences or linguistic ability. But, be modest. Be interested in everyone else and don't think you're the shit. You're not. They will be interested in you, but don't confuse interest with fascination. Are you talking about the US more than you are asking about them? They'll lose interest if they didn't ask you. Anyone would. 


Also, if someone has a weird opinion about the US, your city, your race, your laws.. don't react harshly. Be intellectually honest, but never dominate. I was told in August 2007 that the US would never elect Obama because he was black, despite what the polls said. I never told him who I supported, but it became clear after 40 seconds that this was his opinion and it wasn't going to change. He wasn't my professor, and he wasn't my friend, why should I continue to look like an asshole nerd talking statistics and sampling? Incidentally, when Obama won, my boss congratulated me (apparently he assumed that, being a fairly well-read and articulate person, there was no possibility that I might have different political leanings).  


In Spain, you will be seen as a blowhard if your position is obvious, repetitious, longwinded, or not expressed with humility. If you think that something works well or better in the US, express your opinion rationally and sincerely, but don't spend hours trying to convince others that it's better to not have a siesta (i.e., it's impossible for me to get my suits dry cleaned because they are usually only open when I'm working). It's sufficient to say it once, but unless you're not a pedant extraordinaire, consider softening your criticism of certain things with something positive from their culture. 

For instance, don't rage against the fact you can't get your frozen chai queef bubble venti at 3pm because the shop is closed. Say: ""Man, it's sometimes frustrating to not be able to always get what I want, but it's not so bad since the gym (Holiday gym) is open."" If you can't think of something positive about the system, don't make it up just to be polite. Although anyone that can't come up with something positive about something that millions of others do should probably reasses the way they're approaching life.


As Americans, we have been brought up to speak our mind because we're all Sesame Street special and we did oh so well on the SATs and did you know that in the US, we can get, like, pizza, WHENEVER we want? However, the praise for the US brings me to another important point.


Spanish people will be very willing to express exasperation at the state of their country or culture (""*este es un país de panderetas*""). They will say that their country is shit or going down the pooper. Do not take this as an invitation to bash their country. Think of it like your girlfriend or boyfriend complaining about their parents. Tread softly. You don't get license to bash your SO's parents the same way s/he does. Nor should you have license. 


If you do join in, it may and probably will quickly turn to criticism of the US (or you) and not in a jokey way. Spanish people absolutely love 90% of their culture and country, but nevertheless moan about it. As a foreigner (guiri), so do not pile on. If someone asks you directly, be honest if you have a reasonably informed opinion, but do NOT insult them. Be willing to express what you consider to be good or bad about the US and Spain, but exaggerate neither. Most will have strong assumptions or theories on the US, both true and false.  


Watch your wallet on the metro. And, speaking of the metro, please tell your friends to maintain some semblance of decorum. We don't all need to hear about your intro to Spanish culture class or who hooked up with whom last night or how wasted you are/were. This isn't Jersey Shore. Is everyone looking at you like you're fucking aliens?.... when in Rome... speak like a normal human being, not at 95dB. Many times I've been on the metro with Americans loudly criticizing something. I get truly embarrassed and always pray they're wearing a Maple leaf. Never (seriously, Canadians, stop being so nice!). 


If they're near me, I sometimes make a remark about what they're saying, just to get them to shut up.  ""Like, so, we, like, went to, like, Gino's. God I, like, hate the pizza like, soooooo much here. I can't wait to have Pizzeria Uno when I get back."" Since I'm wearing a suit or speaking Spanish with my girlfriend (at a normal volume), they're taken aback when I say, ""Well, maybe you should try new places. Or get a flight to Naples for EUR 80 r/t on Ryan Air... That's far better than both."" They're embarrassed that someone was listening (it's pretty hard to ignore), but not that they're talking twice as loud as anyone else. Amazing.


Your classes will probably be pretty easy to pass since you're studying aborad or, at least, the professors will take it easy on you. If you are in classes with Spaniards, you'll be shocked at how much they talk in class. Cheating is an open secret. Don't cheat or talk in class (i.e., don't do as the Romans).


Oh, and if you want to watch the NCAA/NFL/NBA? www.rojadirecta.me


*Edit*: Added a few things and also edited for clarity. 

Now at work, I remembered another thing. The Spanish keyboard is different, obviously (Look ma'! ç, Ñ, º, ª!!!!). But, I imagine you'll be bringing a laptop so it doesn't really matter. Also, check monthly average temperatures. it can be pretty hot in September, but sometimes pretty cold in the fall/winter, so bring a range of clothing.


Lastly, and I can't believe I forgot this. Eat like a goddamned champ. Don't just go to VIPs with your American friends. Find where the locals are eating and go there. There can be amazing cheap places and amazing expensive places (Spain has numerous three Michelin star restaurants and Spaniards are extremely proud of their food. Rightfully so). Check out reviews: http://11870.com/k/es/es/madrid 


Try new foods. I tried tripe because my fiancé's 95 year old grandmother made me. I didn't like it. She laughed. I squirmed. A (mostly) good time was had by all. Most new foods were amazing. Going to Málaga? Eat espetos and chanquetes. You will write me a thank you card. 

Have fun!


**tl;dr: be modest, open to new experiences, eat lots of good food. Don't insult Spain even if they do, don't be obnoxious on the metro.**

It then demands Iran to not even be able to have nuclear technology (which is simply needed for any country). Let alone nuclear weapons for deterrence. Even though Iran is surrounded by US-invaded countries. And nuclear powers (pakistan, India, Israel). It could use some deterrence.

Israel is not even able to make peace with a nation who has virtually no weapons or armament and is under their total control. I'm talking about Palestine. Israel keeps pretending that Palestine for some reason is a threat to their country. It invades Palestine regularly and civilian casualties are common.

Now Germany is giving them the power to get unseen around the world in submarines with nuclear warheads. It's not only going to be used a deterrence, it is going to be used as a pawn. Mark my words. Giving a state like Israel this capability is asking for trouble and I seriously can't believe Germany is still doing this shit trying to make up for Hitler. We have forgiven, the world has forgiven, but Israel is abusing it for power. 

""So far, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met none of the terms.""

They don't care. They don't see it the way the Germans see it. They are not taking this seriously as a peace offer. They just take and they'll be back to ask for more.

That is a more accurate description of the Israeli ""siege mentality"" than a true statement of fact.  Israel has peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan.

Syria is a failed state at this point, while Lebanon is close to it, and both have regularly been pushed around and defeated by Israel.  Iran is supposedly a threat to Israel, but I think an objective analysis of that situation reveals Israel to be the aggressor.  The US-backed Gulf monarchies are basically Israeli allies, since all of them don't like Iran and are close to America.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Exactly. All those tools and money goes to something the EZ messed up, something we said no to. Then the EZ should write their own treaties, get their own institutions. Barroso doesn't act like a EU president (of the comission, I know), he acts like EZ president. There are countries, like Bulgaria, who are way poorer than Greece, put some time and effort into them. 

Eurozone is the European Union, it is the heart of the union, it contains most of the population, most of the industry, most of the trade and most of the political power. If you remove the Eurozone from the European Union you won't have union at all. This is a fact. This is the reason why Barroso acts like the President of the Eurozone and why the union concentrates on the Eurozone.

&gt; Yes, but there is no date on that, so technically it can be in 100 years. Second, then they should ask us what they do with the EZ money, but they don't, they just want us to pay more. Third, we have a de facto opt out Link. I'd personally rather that Sweden opt out, than join.

There is no date, but the European commission has the ability to start proceeding against a country they deem not to be following their treaty obligation. In essence this is a political question and when the time and situation is right, the commission will start the procedure, it may take a decade or two, but sooner or later countries have to decide are they on the Eurozone and thus in the union, or are they out.

&gt; Nothing you have said explains why countries that doesn't follow rules doesn't get punished (they are supposed to if they don't follow the rules). When did we vote about that? When was that pact re-written. It never was, EZ just plainly ignored the rules. How on earth is that not undemocratic and corrupt? Can Sweden ignore rules too? Can we ignore paying for example? Other countries don't care, why should we? Or, you play by the rules and start punishing countries that disobey.

Rules change based on how things go on. The Maastrict treaty and the Eurozone were established on assumptions that have now been shown to been not adequate and now there is push to change the rules. That is how things are and will be. It is politics.

&gt; Also, how can funds just be directed towards the EZ when it's demanded by big countries. Don't we have a budget? 

Why not? It is for the good of the union that the Eurozone will get things right and countries in trouble can be sorted out right.

You might want to do a kayak tour on the [Werse river](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werse). It is very tranquil, loads of fun and you get to see the Münsterland in all its forms.

If you have a local acquaitance, you might want to rent a riksha and have your own tour of Münster. You can rent those rikshas all over Münster.

With summer just around the corner, you could just get yourself a bike and go on a bike ride through the countryside. Pack yourself a picnic and some beer and stop whenever you feel like it. If you are up for a challenge, cycle all the way down to Dülmen, especially when they are having their wild horse event. It is one of the last wild horses resorts in Europe and once a year they are herded together and the young stallions are caught and sold in front of a public. I loved it as a kid.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; No, it's corruption. All countries are equal, but some are more equal than others, to paraphrase Orwell. If the EZ had followed their own rules (debt 60 % of GDP etc) they would not be in this mess. Second, they have billions of Euros to pay in fines for not following them. Third - if you say one can just change the rules, does that apply to all the countries and all the rules or is it something the EZ can decide. It's nothing but hypocracy, double standard and corruption. Otherwise, Sweden/Denmark/UK can decide not to follow the rules too - why should we? Why don't we abstain for paying for a few years, it seems like all the rules are for bending, which you have pointed out. Call it politics then, if it suits you. You can't claim that just the EZ countries rules are for bending, or do you honestly have that much double standard.

All countries are equal in principle, but in reality due to some countries being bigger or having more money than others, they in practice have much more power than others. This is just how things are, not only inside in the European Union, but also in the bigger world. With the EU at least there are common procedures and an independent body guiding the organization and decision making.

Sweden/Denmark/UK could very well try to not obey the rules and for example not pay their membership fees, but that would be very unwise as they would be in minority and couldn't get the other states to accept their stance. Do remember that even when France and Germany force their way so to say it, they do it via negotiations where some sort of consensus or acceptance from all countries is gotten. 

&gt; Says who? A lot of economist/banks/other countries says the Euro is stupid from the start, and I hardly have to mentioning everything that is wrong with it. That some people in the EZ countries don't want to admit failure doesn't give them right to stamp on other countries, take money from them and ignore rules and laws.

The point of Euro is closer integration of the European Union by fusing different economies together into a single entity. The end result of this process will be an European superstate, a new super power in the world stage that can protect and advance European interests in the wider world.

It adds up; with places like Greece in antiquity there was amazing progress. In much colder places humans haven't advanced enough to strive there. In very warm places - like Egypt and warmer - the decline had started becoming reality.

Today where central heating and other conveniences such as transportation and better shelters thrive, it's much more likely to have huge advances in the colder places like Sweden and much less in the warmer places like Greece or South of Europe or Portugal or even the very South of England where Shelter has become ""automatic"", no much extra effort is needed (excessive burning of extra energy etc.).

Southern countries are better off than they were, but I’m not entirely sure they couldn’t have been better in a different setting. The competitive gap with northern countries was never closed and the union transfers did nothing to help this aspect on the south (money was absorbed mainly by CAP and infrastructure).

If you need to  improvise a new route to avoid controls, you might as well know where you're going. (the st-Ouen/Clignancourt flea market is cool to have a walk, to get the line 4 at Porte de Clignancourt).

Scout the area a bit before going in. Look for the police but also any sign of nervosity from the look outs. But don't overdo it, it might make them nervous, too, they'll think you're an informer (happened to me). If they ask, explain yourself.

It comes down to cultural differences. In Poland the law says that in public procurements the cheapest bid wins, period. This is because a tender specifies detailed requirements that are considered ironclad and sufficient, so that anyone who meets them is assumed capable of doing the job. There is great comment under the WSJ article about the differences between Chinese and Western world views in this respect:

Is this truly the final goal we as humanity can achieve, is there nothing better? To be endlessly dragging ourselves down to become more competitive? You really think that this will lead to a point where there’s a world’s labour force of 5+ billion people employed in 9 to 5 jobs and where everyone is able to live on a decent standard of living? That to me seems like the real utopianism.

It just doesn't work. Think about it, neoliberal reforms in order to become more competitive by lowering labour costs also lower the world’s total capitalist investment, as the market becomes smaller due to lower demand (because workers can buy less). Individual regions and countries´ manufactures may increase production by following a neoliberal agenda due to a reduction in labour costs, but it comes at the expense of the rest of the world. Stagnating wages (relative to productivity and even inflation) and flexibilization of the labour market with “mini-jobs” may have been quite successful for Germany, but it comes at the expense of the rest of Europe. It’s a race-to-the-bottom basically and it’s the utopian aspect of neoliberalism that they never think through the bigger picture of their reforms.

Edit: You've actually mischaracterized British mainstream opinion, I think, which is precisely that something fairly dramatic will have to be done, or Greece will leave the Euro, which would lead to all sorts of other problems, and probably then require dramatic measures down the line.

The more people are undecided or prone to switch in the last minute, the less reliable the prediction. There is an enormous amount of pressure on voters, and many will probably make their final decision in the voting booth. In the case of Syriza, we have a formerly small fringe party going mainstream, which means pollsters can't go by prior experience with reported vs. actual voting behavior.

Northern Europeans don't hold all the opinions you read in the cheapest tabloids, you know? Plus, the worst insults so far did not come from the north, they came from the south. Greek newspapers called Merkel a nazi repeatedly. That's on a whole other level, worse than what northern tabloids have written.

That German (and French) money can be seen in unfinished housing estates on the sides of hills in Ireland.  It's never coming back.  But the wealth and power of the German state is, to a certain extent, being used to backstop the stupid decisions of the German banks while disguising same as a 'bailout' or form of generosity to the improvident, shiftless, unreliable denizens of these countries and that hurts.

I just checked some example days and trains, and prices are between 19€ and 39€ for Dresden - Weimar and between 39€ and 69€ for Weimar - Bonn. You might be able to find cheaper prices for Weimar - Bonn if you're flexible which train you're going to take, and if you want to travel on a day with a high number of passengers (such as every Friday) expect more expensive tickets and fuller trains.

Regarding the Dresden-Weimar part: if you use only regional trains (RE, RB, S) and no intercity trains (ICE, IC, EC), you can get the Sachsen-Ticket which costs 21€ for one person (plus 3€ for every extra person up to 5 total) and allows you to travel with all regional trains within Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia for one day. The intercity train ride takes a little less longer than the regional one (3 hours vs. 4 hours). 

The Sachsen-Ticket also includes the bus ride from Weimar to Buchenwald and back, but is not valid before 9 a.m. Monday through Friday.

You do not need to prebook the Sachsen-Ticket, you can just buy it at the railway station. The intercity trains can be cheaper (19€) or more expensive, depending on which train you book on which day, but they don't include the bus ride from Weimar Hbf to Buchenwald (1,80€ one way).

Also, the Sachsen-Ticket, the Sachsen-Anhalt-Ticket and the Thüringen-Ticket are the same thing. They cost the same and are valid in all three states.

If you want to do more train travel, look into the [Deutschland-Pass](http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/ufnuf/in_55_days_ill_be_landing_in_munich_and_traveling/c4w3uc6?context=3).",0,1338852982,null,0,false,0,c4wb52u,t3_uj5mc,t1_c4wb52u,t1_c4watfo,null,1429068904,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

I know it's annoying, and I know it makes you self-conscious about your language usage and pronunciation. When I was a student, I spent a year in Japan. The same happened to me, especially in big cities like Tôkyô, where people were used to foreigners. I could tell they understood me, since they answered my questions without trouble - only in English instead of Japanese. So I really get how frustrating that is, and most people just think they're being nice or they are just eager to speak English, since there aren't that many opportunities. That can make it even more frustrating.


Now, you said they often don't know where you're from - PERFECT. That's your solution right there, at least with random strangers: Pretend not to understand English.
I promise, it works. But think of a country you want to be from, in case they ask. It's easier when you're not from an English-speaking country, because you only have to lie a little.

At the same time there is a loss in trust in the worth of the euro on a person to person and private free market basis, going against the grain of what mainstream pro-euro politics and media is promoting.
