I have no idea what you mean by this. The Court did not oppose the process of suspending the president, gave a green flag to the new temporary president, approved one of the dismissals, approved the new referendum law and has dismissed other complaints made by the opposing party. 

The only ruling made against what happened last week was concerning the law limiting its powers when it comes to Parliament decisions.

&gt; Having the support of the parliament, which they have gained not as a result of elections, but as a result of opportunistic defections.

This was also the case of the previous party that held power. It's a situation that can't be avoided because of how tight the result of the last elections was. Basically, to be able to guvern, the big parties need to rely on the very small ones, with some of them being formed after the last elections.

&gt; They explain that they just want to remove the hurdles in order to make the country easier to govern. Well, democracy is not an institutional design that aims to make things easy for the people in power.

One thing is to keep the government in check through constitutional means, and a whole different thing is to threaten the prime minister with the loss of his PhD one day before the information actually goes public. It's a practice that the now suspended president has done over and over again and working, ""living"" together with such a man is virtually impossible.

The suspension of Traian Basescu is not an idea that came to the new Guvernment because they wanted more power. It's something that has been requested by the people for a few years now, including in the street protests from this winter.

Edit: Ohh and about the author of the article, Andrei Plesu. Yes, he is an intellectual and has held important positions in the government, but he is also a long time supporter of president Basescu.

Only the fact that he changed this law in this ridiculous form should tell you what kind of president he is.

It’s not a question of the legality of any particular decision. There’s always a way, especially when you own the parliament. Even if many or most of these decisions were technically legal, that doesn’t mean that there’s no cause for concern.

Yes, Băsescu’s impeachment was requested by many protesters and I think the referendum is called for. But the USL is showing the same disregard for democratic boundaries as Băsescu did. The people who were against Băsescu should very much be against USL, for the same reasons.

As for Andrei Pleşu, he is hardly a supporter of Băsescu. This is obvious to anyone who actually reads his articles. Of course, to the USL, everybody who’s against them is a supporter of Băsescu. Here’s a quote from the very article we’re discussing:

&gt; [The old government] also created resentment among Romanians by tolerating too many moral and legal offences within their own ranks. They paid little attention to education and healthcare, and they served their own political clientele, thereby obstructing efforts to rebuild the country's ruined infrastructure.

The banks in Spain are receiving a loan (not free money, but at a lower rate of what they would get), EZ is not getting shares for several reasons: if they do they will be responsible till they sell them for every loses the banks may have. Right now they control the amount of money they give to the banks. Spain will be responsible for the debt too, so it is more probable that they get their money back. This also means that banks can fall more easily.

The amount of money needed is uncertain for one reason: banks in Spain and many other all around the world trough them, invested a lot in real estate. 

But real estate was a bubble, a huge one, till 6 millions of ""houses"" (all kind of flats, apartments, etc..) are unoccupied (source: http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2012/01/05/actualidad/1325752378_850215.html (in Spanish)), 1.6 million have never been occupied and those were mainly financed by the banks.

The problem is that no one knows for sure how many of these will end owned by the banks due to unpaid mortgages or never sold ones. Also it is unknown their value because nobody is buying. I hope this responds why they don't know how much money they need.

As far as I know, none of the banks have been investigated for Euribor manipulations.

The current form of the referendum law, that was approved by the Court, has went through the Parliament where it was voted by the majority. 

Funny thing is, it would have already been in effect if not for PDL making the complaint to the Constitutional Court, because they wanted back the original form, that they had adopted in April.

About the need for a minimum presence, let me tell you why it's a stupid criteria. Presence can be affected by external factors, like what season it is, how's the weather in that day, how old are the lists by which the number of needed votes is decided (very old in this case), how well the referendum is organised, etc. It's complete bs that the validity of a referendum is affected by such unrelated factors. I say affected because any harsh conditions clearly favor one side, the one that is against the dismissal of the president.

Which leads to the second reason why it's a stupid rule. With a minimum turn-out required, one side can win by simply staying home. The referendum can end with 8 million votes for the dismissal and 0 against and guess what, the president won't be dismissed. It's ridiculous. What legitimacy will the president have after this? And what kind of a vote it is when one side, the one in minority, can stay home to win?

&gt; So Basescu started that? He always went, then Ponta came and said that he wants to go.

The fact that he always went does not make it his right to do so in the future. The conference was mainly directed at the heads of government, which in our case is the prime-minister. Unless the prime-minister is named Boc, in which case of course Basescu will always go. :P

&gt; It's mind-numbing that for you that's worse than than the actual plagiarism.

Yes, the president using his power (no matter if it's the secret services or his control of parts of the press) to hit on a rival is actually worse than plagiarism in my book. Not to say that Ponta shouldn't resign for this.

&gt; Care to give an example?

How about asking a written statement from a new minister that he did not plagiarize his PhD. What kind of retarded condition is that? 

&gt; I've reread the Court's statement now and I don't agree that there is at least one point where the Court agreed that there were sufficient grounds for a dismissal. Care to enlighten me?

If the Court thought none of the points were ground for dismissal, it would have given a negative verdict, like it did in 2007.

This is a stupid argument, as such a case will never ever happen. :P It's impossible. If the side supporting the dismissal would stay home, they would risk losing the vote. Same goes for the other side. They would both be encouraged to go out and vote and let the majority win.

On the other hand, with a minimum turn-out rule, the party supporting the president can easily encourage its voters to stay home, in which case it will be veeeery hard for the turn-out to be bigger than 9.5 million people.

Thankfully, the attributions given to the president by the Constitution do not give him  the possibility to actually do a lot of harm, but even so, Basescu managed to not miss a single opportunity.

He is the president that announced economical decisions before the government even knew about them, he's the one that never truly disguised his use of the secret services for personal political battles, he's the one that did many out-of-place comments on certain court decisions (for example, explaining that the government shouldn't follow a definitive verdict because the judges did not specify where the financing should come from, as if this was their duty..), he's the one that signed the famous pensions law that was unlawfully voted in the Parliament by his own party (the chairwoman counted 160 votes, when there really were only 80 supporting the law), he's the one that went from calling Oprea the ""head of the Nastase mafia"" to having him in the government and supporting his party, he's the president that has 3 warnings of racism from the national ethics commitee (not sure if this is the name in english), he's the one that told our doctors to go work outside of the country, when our hospitals are highly under-manned, he's the one that lied to us about the real level of crisis in Romania, just to achieve his re-election (in the november - december 2009 campaign he was yelling left and right that we're clear of the recession, that we're recovering and everything will be good, just to come out and announce the most drastic austerity measures in the recent history of our country several months later, after he got re-elected).

And I could go on. I will actually.

He's the one that got caught on tape hitting a small kid and still denied it, he's the one that made incredibly harsh and out-of-place remarks concerning king Mihai, a historical figure that demands a lot more respect than him, he is the president that boosted his barely literate daughter in the european parliament and in various high paying jobs, he is the candidate that was seen with several convicted criminals during his campaign, using them to get funds and support from certain communities, he is the president that has never, ever been able to successfully cooperate with any institution or politician that wasn't his direct ally or under his direct command (I dare you to give me an example), he is the president that even if required by law to become neutral, he has participated in countless PDL internal meetings, while never going to another party.

You are right one of the reasons is that the numbers are too high but as I mentioned the bubble is (was) really big, the exact numbers are appearing now, specially after unemployment stopped growing: unemployment has grown from 8% in 2007 to more than 24% in 2012 that means that a lot of people could not pay for their loans anymore (I will discuss unemployment a little bit more latter). One measure that is probably going to be in the conditions to Spain is the creation of a ""bad bank"" which is supposed to gather all the crap that is in the system at this moment. No idea how that will work though.

&gt;Also, you are saying Spain is responsible for the loans? Why are Spain being responsible for the bank's loans without collateral? When Sweden took over our banks bad debt, we demanded something in return - shares. Why should the Spanish people demand less? It was actually a good business as well for us in the end, we made money from it.

A little bit misunderstanding here: Spain has nationalized four banks, three small ones and ""Bankia"" which is very large (and the reason that the bailout was requested) but the EZ has not. Other banks, those which are not in a bad situation are going to receive loans (in a similar way that a lot of banks in Europe have been receiving loans during the last years).

Other conditions of the bailout will more than probably (at least the press in Spain is saying so) require that both the Spanish Central Bank and the European Central Bank get more power (details again are missing and are what are being discussed at this moment).


Having said all this I agree with you: more transparency would be great, too much lies have been told the last years in Spain and I hope that the bailout solves this. Crisis also mean opportunities if well managed.




About unemployment, as promised: you must know one thing first: about 20% of students leave school without having completed mandatory education. As you can understand many of them ended up in the construction sector. The level of unemployment for them has grown from 10% to a 35% as nothing is being built up however for those who ended obligatory education unemployment has grown from 6% to 14%.

Greece cannot breathe right now, cannot cater for its own citizens, and is being burdened with this huge weight of illegal immigration. It brought alot of negatives too, e.g. crime, shanty towns where immigrants have no real homes, robberies, rapes, murders. 

I am compassionate to the illegals and I support them, and sympathise with them, but all I see is victimisation of the Greek people, when the reality is that they are being overwhelmed with this problem which the EU does not seem to be doing anything about.

true,VallanMandrake,BAVA,Bayern,"I searched for an overview (I thought our ministery should have one...), but found none. A pity.

There are some things you need to know:

Emergency:
 
The numbers are: 112 for fire AND health. 110 for the police. Do not call for fun (well that should be obvious). If you see somebody in trouble (bleeding to death, car crash, etc) you MUST help them. If the situation is dangerous (most cases) it is enough to call 112 or 110. If you don't you can get imprisond. You cannot get sued for trying to help.

drugs (possesion and use):

 smoking 18+, alcohol (beer, wine) 16+, BUT strong (destilled) ones like vodka are restricted to 18+. Everything else is illegal (i do not know the exact laws and punishments check online if you want to). Depending on the state it can be illegal to smoke in bars/trainstations etc. 

Sex: 

both patners over 18 - ok. One over 18 (under 21) and other 16-18 -ok. Everything with bigger age differeneces can mean trouble for the older partner. Sex with your Studend/someone you bear power over can mean trouble for you. Needless to say is that rape is illegal. Child Pornography is illegal. Even sketches. (Lets hope this does not concern you...)

Children:

Under 18 you are a child. You can only do limited contracts, and can be judged under special lax law.

Police: 

Difficult. Generally: do not say more than your identification (better take it with you, saves trouble). But in some rare occasions some smalltalk can get you out of (small) trouble... If they want to search you house they need to have a warrant, and they are only allowed to search/take what is written there. And Yes, you have the right to an attorny and to remain silent (well if you do identify yourself you will get in trouble). You are allowed to tape interactions, but it is not reccomended - some officers (few, but they exist) feel attacked and might hurt/imprison you. The police has to identify themselfes, but can feel offended (less likely, but possible). They can imprison you without consent of a judge for 24 hours (someone wrote 48 in some states, I do not know about that). If they order you to be naked in your celll (or similar - happend to my brother) it would be a violation of our constitution paragraph 1 ""Human dignity shall be inviolable"".

the Constitution: 

Well that one wont help you in your daily life. Read it anyway scince it is (in my opinion) brilliant (in particular the first paragraphs). 

the BGB (citizen rights): 

Contains rules about everything. Examples are what kind of contracts are valid, what the rules about buying sth are (example: if you buy sth. and it breaks within the first 6 (?) months you can return it, and your seller (has to be a company) has to prove that it had not been defect form the beginning.) AND: we can sue sb for damages. BUT you wont get more than what was broken. They destroy your cloths - you get new ones. 

Internet: 

don't use bittorret to get sth illegal (because bittorrent distributes the content). Lawyers search for offenders. Watching videos online is ok. Giving (private, non comercial) music/videos (mp3, CDs ..) to people you know real live is legal! Recording radio/TV is legal. Recording the audio output of a youtube video is - in theory - legal (But no trail so far...). Police/Lawyers can trace your IP, so be careful. (In case of trail: say you do not remember - and ask a good lawyer.)

Behavior: 

do not do shit in public. If you disrupt public order  (""Öffentliches Ärgernis"") you can get fined. Loud noise (like a Pary during night in a residial area will get the police called, they will come and tell you to shut up. If you do, you will most likely be ok. Do not start fires other than designated areas (the firefightes might come and you are in real trouble ...). Normal BBQ (with no high flames) are ok. 

foreigners: 

I suppose you do not have the german citizen ship, and come with some kind of visa. Please ask what you are allowed to do. Are you allowed to work? Travle abroad/come back into the EU? Ask several competent people if the german laws (as above) apply to you (I think they do...). Know that germany has extradition treaties with almost everyone, and that you will be judged on your original law (except if you can expect capital punishmend, in that case you wont be extradited).

Other:

 If you take part in an political demonstration, you may not cover your face (!) (Vermummungsverbot). You may not go hunting or fishing without a license. You should not take in cats/dogs since the are most likely not strays. You may not camp without permission of the owner (You wont get in much trouble if you camp somewere in a forest, but it is still illegal and you can get fined). You may walk anywhere where it is not fenced/forbidden - worst case is they will order you to leave.

    -

OH, I wrote a lot. Well that is everything that comes to my mind. If you want to know about a specific subject or any details please ask. 

Edit: O it is difficutl to style a big paragraph of text acceptable....

Edit: You liked it, ok, here is some more: (In particular on where you can get to know your rights)

Law System:

In germany we have a different law system (compared with the US). We do not have ""case law"" (*). We have law books for everything. There are several layers: the Constitutions, the laws and the ""Verordnungen"" (~practices?) the constitution is almost unchangable and contains a framework, and basic (blurry) rights. The laws contain pretty sharp rights and regulations. (and are passed by the congress). The ""Verordnungen"" contain details on how the laws are acted upon, example: StVO (""Straßen Verkehrs Ordnung"", regulates traffic and the exact fines for driving to fast. Yes, the EXACT fines). The ones of the federation (Germany) rank higher than anything from the states (or the communities).

If you are going to be judged, you have to be found guilty of breaking an EXISTING law. If such a law does not exist, you will not be punished. (Careful, we have laws for everything!). Example: civil-servant-doctors (""Verbeamtete Ärtzte"") are forbidden from taking presents (like bribes...), but a recent ruling (somebody got sued) clearified that non civil servants (""nicht verbeamtete Ärtzte"") are allowed to take such presents, because even though it is morally wrong (bribs etc..) the law only applies to civil servants.

* People drink whenever here.  A glass of wine at lunch is almost standard.  Weekend afternoon picnics with bottles of wine/beer are also common.  Regional drinks - there are tons of ""french"" drinks.  There is of course the wine.  I tend to enjoy a pastis on warmer days.  I'm sure others will comment here with their favs :-)
* I think coffee in paris tends to be a bit overrated by americans.  They tend to think any bistro has the best coffee... Caféothèque and Bal Café are two examples of places that are supposed to serve a proper coffee (I'm not a coffee nut so I'm just relaying this info).  For cheap lunches I'd suggest getting a simple sandwich at a boulangerie (bakery).
* People throw their butts on the ground.  I've heard they're going to make it illegal to do that but nothing's changed so far.  Can't smoke indoors anymore though.
* I love all the French towns !  But if you're here only for a week I'd say just stay in Paris.  Maybe a day trip to Versailles or Fontainebleau if you feel like seeing a chateau but there's plenty in Paris to keep you busy for a week.
* Weather is pretty hot in mid-late August.  I think we can get 90F+ from time to time.  Rare to get over 100 though I think.  However, this years weather has been awful.  Cold and cloudy with very few nice warm days.  You'll need to keep up with the metéo before you arrive.
* Everyone in Paris dresses in designer clothes.  Kidding, you'll be fine.
* Travel on foot if the weather is nice.  In fact, get used to walking now.  If the weather is not nice you might consider a metro pass but it'd be a shame to travel Paris underground.  There are Paris Visite metro passes for 3 days and 5 days (iirc).  Or you can get a navigo (rfid system) but that might be a bit of a hassle for you if you're not up on your french.  There's also some restrictions with the navigo, I think the ""week"" starts on Monday.  I'm sure someone can verify.

Use ATMs for your cash.  Check with your bank beforehand so you're familiar with the fees.

Just so you know, Paris is pretty dead in August.  Everyone goes on vacation and a number of shops will be closed.

See if you can organize a meetup.  I've only been to one but I've been meaning to go to more.  r/paris is a nice group of people.  There's a bar near me called the troll bar and I remember a post where we were saying it'd be a perfect reddit place.  Plus they have great beer there.

Generally when I have people visit we just tend to wander a lot.  The idea is to pick a key spot to start off at, something interesting you know you want to see, then just wander from there.  Walk until your legs hurt then pop into a cafe and order a drink and smoke some cigarettes.  Watch the people go by until you get bored, then get up and start walking again.  If you want you can pick a string of a few key places so if you start to feel like you're really a bit aimless then you can head towards the next place on the list.

Even if the weather sucks - often when it rains in Paris it's very intermittent.  Put a hat on and you can walk a fair amount in the mist/drizzle.  If it starts to come down harder just pop into a cafe.  Rinse, repeat.

I don't find myself in the 17th often - or ever really.  A large part of the 17th is rich, bourgeois.  I find it to be very sterile.  The hotel you're looking at is closer to the 18th though - I think you'd be clear of the rich area.  There's tons of great stuff in the 18th.

To elaborate on the arrondissements a bit.  In the 3rd/4th is the marais.  Nightlife and gay quarter.  In north 11th you have oberkampf.

It's no longer seen as a pure music competition. Its more about the whole act and stage presence. 
Some countries just really gave up of ever winning it and send the most bizarre acts for the fun of it(I remember Austria sending some bizarre geriatric clown-acrobat)

Also in the case of the UK, they dont really care about what they send as they're automatically in the final anyway (Germany, Spain, France, UK and Italy contribute the most financially and therefore get a place in the final)

I'm not so sure about Eastern Europe, as I think they actually send acts that are known not only in their country but in surrounding countries as well (which leads to the political charge of countries voting for each other) and acts that are ""good"".

&gt;La lucha que están llevando los compañeros en éstos momentos, no es para pedir dinero, sino para que se respete el acuerdo firmado el año pasado entre el Ministerio de Industria y los sindicatos mineros, la firma de éste acuerdo tenía unas ayudas asignadas hasta el año 2018.
Éste dinero lo dió La Comunidad Europea y no los Gobiernos Españoles, con ésto quiero decir que no lo puso ningún español para ayudarnos cómo piensa mucha de la gente que tanto nos critica....
En cuanto a éste dinero lo que yo me pregunto, como casi todas las familias mineras, es donde está la parte de los Fondos Mineros que supuestamente iría destinada a la creación de industrias alternativas al carbón en las cuencas mineras, después del cierre de las minas. Pues bien, cómo en muchos otros sectores, el dinero lo manejaron los políticos y los sindicatos. Con parte de éste dinero, os podría decir, por ejemplo, que el Señor Gabino de Lorenzo ( ex-alcalde de Oviedo) pagó las farolas de su ciudad, el nuevo Palacio de Exposiciones y Congresos y otras muchas obras. La ex-alcaldesa de Gijón (la Señora Felgeroso) lo invirtió en la Universidad Laboral y cómo el primero, también en otras obras.
En el Valle de Turón, perteneciente a la Cuenca del Caudal, donde yo vivo, con más de 600 muertos (que sepamos, pues en la guerra civil se quemaron los archivos anteriores) en las minas desde el año 1889 hasta el 2006 cuando se cerraron, hicieron un polideportivo que por cierto, se inauguró sin aseos y así siguen, una senda para pasear y poco más. Todo nuestro entorno está lleno de escombreras, que poco a poco se están intentando recuperar.

&gt;Pero de reindustrialización, que es lo crea los puestos de trabajo estables para que siga habiendo vida, casi nada.

The subsidies are coming back, the subsidies are not coming back, but prior to destroying these people's lives and way of life, how's about some thought to creating those alternative industries that were on the table? Where are they?

Yes. To be fair in 1995 I thought singing itself will go out of fashion and there will just be techno. Now we have actually the opposite, that now there are many singers where the music part is not even important - while in something like Guns'n'Roses singing and music were equally important, for many contemporary singers not. And it sucks. 

Most people just want sweet voices and that is all.

I hope we Eastern Europeans will one day a bit shake up European tastes with mulatós / manele / turbofolk / chalga. This sucks as much as pop, but is at least a bit different and more interesting perhaps.

I'd say that generally European taste in music is almost exactly the same as American. There are some local variations but from your point of view they would probably sound like spoofs of American music, like French Hip Hop, Russian Reggae, etc (I'm not saying they're bad though).

It cost me a bit more than £50, I paid a little extra for a company to run through and check all the paperwork for me and to file on my behalf - about £200 set up and a couple of weeks to come through.  After that accounting isn't too much of a problem and there's plenty of free assistance and information on hand, but once again it pays in the long run to have somebody look over the books for you - and it needn't cost that much.

Having said that the best of both worlds would seem to be the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, which is still part of the EU.  Added to that Gibraltar has no wealth tax, sales tax or value added tax.  Corporation tax is 10%.

Basically UK law but with its own tax code and more lenient but progressive regulation.  It's also got an excellent reputation for Internet set ups - namely through the online gambling industry.  It does seem to be one of the EU hotspots for overseas business set ups.

[EDIT:  this is an equivalent of the type of company I used to set up with in the UK but for Gibraltar - [you can see they themselves are quite used to explaining the initial set ups and explaining how offshore works in Gibraltar, and they're even offering up how to file tax returns which will be an ongoing service they can provide](http://www.gibraltar-corporations-incorporate-in-gibraltar.offshore-companies.co.uk/).  Initial set up fee is £200 (0.5% of start up capital which they say on average is around an extra £10), although this particular company is charging considerably more if you go through them for the extra services they provide.  You could do it for less by going through the Gibraltar Companies House.  If the important thing is less paperwork though, it is the way forward, but it's not the sort of thing you want to have sitting dormant for a while if you're not going to be freelancing straight away.  EDIT2:  I'm interested in this myself and looked into the company I linked to a little more, and it turns out that the amount they charge goes up considerably on the actual cost of setting it up yourself.

Also, the Tatars appear to be a mix of (earlier) Nogay Tatars and (more recent) Crimean Tatars. 

I think the main difference people notice is the fact that the Turks look „European” while the Tatars have „(East) Asian” features.

I have no idea if the Tatars here maintain ties with the ones in Poland or Crimeea, but they do have ties with Turkey, afaik. 

**LE:** There was an „International festival of Turkish-Tatar song and dance” in Constanța, in 2009, and judging from the flags [in this photo](https://picasaweb.google.com/tatar.officemax.ro/Yildizlar#5388499471882967426), Ukraine was also represented. The photo is from the [tatar.ro](http://www.tatar.ro) website, and judging by their *links* section, they appear to keep in touch with both Crimeean Tatars and Russian Tatars (from Tatarstan).

&gt; You're 100% right that a lot more can be done in Europe for international trading and internet entrepreneurship. 

&gt; Yes our mothertongues might not be english but many international companies are too lazy to bother to understand other legal systems. Sorry but we're not going to copy paste the common law. The political ""status quo"" of Europe is NOT the only problem here.

The first point about English, I don't really understand what you're trying to say there. English is our lingua franca; if you're going to do business in the EU you need to use it.

The second one, I don't really get what you're trying to say there either. I said nothing about common law.

Then, your list of ""European Kickstarters"" neatly confirms what I'm arguing. The only one I've heard of is Flattr, and only because it's the TPB guy, and it's not the same as Kickstarter. When I visit the others I'm greeted with a service in either Dutch or French that focuses solely on NL or BE. Why didn't they create a service that encompasses the entire EU? For a number of reasons, but you can probably guess for yourself what they are.

There are two types of companies who do EU-wide business:

The first is your typical local company who decides to ""go international"". They either provide a virtual service, or they ""ship internationally"" from wherever they're located. They just happen to ship to the rest of the EU, but to them that's not much different from shipping to Argentina.

The second is the type of company that is *actually* trying to have a presence in the EU. They think, ""oh, nice, a 500 million strong market, we've got to be there"", and then they're hit with a hugely fragmented ""single market"" and a maze of legal and cultural differences that makes it very difficult and costly for them to operate here. 

A prime example of this second type of company is Pixmania. God bless them, they really do try, and they cover the entire EU except for RO&amp;BG (I guess they're just shit out of luck). When I go to pixmania.com I'm greeted with a ""choose your country"" page. I mean, WTF, I don't give a shit, I just want to buy stuff from them. Then I choose a country and I'm sent to *that country's website* which is locked to one language and one currency, and the inventory is specific for that one country. Why do they do this? I'm guessing it's a mixture of legal requirements and that still unshakable European attitude that because ""we're different nations with different cultures and thus we must all be treated differently"". Think about all the money and time they waste on creating and maintaining this infrastructure. Even Amazon, with all their might, couldn't create an EU-wide store; instead they have separate stores for the biggest countries and everyone else is left with nothing. Sure, you can go to amazon.de or whatever and they'll ship it to you, but then you will have to understand German. Thus, everybody who isn't fortunate enough to live in one of Amazon's chosen countries uses amazon.co.uk because they happen to use English. But they still have to pay in GBP, so they pay a higher price because of the conversion rate.

Man, now you made me rant. The sad truth is that we're a long, long, loooong way from anything resembling a true single market still.",0,1342015673,null,0,false,0,c5cgqfd,t3_wbbv6,t1_c5cgqfd,t1_c5c4grl,null,1429349479,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Some of the national chains (Wall Street, Berlitz, etc) do actually hire teachers on a salary, etc, but as far as I know in Germany most english teachers are freelancers.

If you're not out to get rich, it can be a fun job where you get to meet a lot of interesting people. It doesn't pay very well and you really have to scramble to get enough work to pay the bills. Virtually all freelancers I knew when I was teaching lived with and were largely dependent on their (German) significant others. Especially at the beginning it wasn't unusual to only have a couple of hours of work a week from a particular school - which is not enough to cover all of your costs. I ended up working for several different schools at the same time and eventually got a higher paying gig at a college. For me it was a great way to legally live and work here so I could be with my GF at the time. I also met a wide range of fascinating people from many walks of life - throughout my teaching career I taught (among others): corporate executives, unemployed academics, a doctor specializing in knee surgeries, an agrarian soil scientist, technical salesmen, college students, secretaries for a window and door manufacturer, and many others. I don't regret it a bit, although it wasn't for me long term.

If you are wanting to get to know the German language, then teaching English can make it *very* difficult. Your students will, of course, only want to speak English with you, but worst of all is that you'll be surrounded by other expats at the school. Unless you really bend over backwards like I did to not hang out with just expats, there is a big danger of staying stuck in the bubble and never really getting out. I knew several expat english teachers who had lived here for 10+ years and could barely speak German. 

Of course you don't have to be like that, but you really really have to make an effort especially at the beginning when *no one* understands your broken German. You will try to order things in German at the bakery and the person will automatically answer back in English, etc. You simply have to brute force your way through and not give in. Also, watching enormous amounts of German TV worked well for me.

In 2005 I was making between 15 and 17 euros per teaching hour (45 minutes), depending on the school. A typical weekly course would be 90 minutes on, say, a Monday evening, and most teachers seemed to get around 3-5 such courses per week. I have no idea what the going rates are these days, and remember this was in Leipzig; the rates in Stuttgart are probably very different.

A better way to deal with these kind of issues is to maintain a no bailout policy. If a company or industry goes under, then it goes under. This will put pressure to unions and employees to keep their salaries and benefits in a sustainable level. It will also force municipalities to actively work to diversify their industrial and business bases.

Wozu? Ich war in England. Mir hats da an ein paar Stellen geschmeckt. An anderen nicht. Ich kann (aus Erfahrung) nicht behaupten das ""*DIE englische Küche*"" schlecht ist. Punkt. Ich kenne Engländer denen schmeckts auch. Wozu brauche ich anonyme Statistiker die undefinierbare Kriterien zu Boulevardmeldungen umbauen wenn ich tatsächliche Erfahrungswerte aus meiner Lebensrealität habe.

You mention primaries and the like in the US. If Im not mistaken the main movements that you can vote on are Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, and Tea Party. After that there are green movements, socialists, white nationalists etc, but these are all small and politically negligable. Correct me if Im wrong.

According to wikipedia, in both chambers of Congress there are just 2 different parties represented (with 2 independants who however caucus with democrats)

And for the past 150 years, there has either been a Republican or Democrat president.  Granted there are different branches of democrats or rpeublics, but the main ideology of both parties (the only 2 parties who are able to win anything in the US) are to a certain extent rather similar as they are both free market (what in Europe would be called ""liberal"" (as in pro-capitalist) parties)


Now in France for the last elections we had 10 candidates. The movements they represented were New left socialist, old school communist, green, social democrat, centrist, centre right pro market, euro-sceptic centre right pro market, far right, and some dude who beleives space exploration should be our main priority. Other parties did not run in the election but instead allied with bigger parties (christian democrats in the centre right, radicals in the centrist party). Already here the initial choice for a voter is much more than you would get in America. Plus the laws in France make it that every single party must have equal exposure on television, so by the end of the electoral season, all the candidates and their proposals are well known. 

To win a party usually needs the help of other parties. In this sense, the social democrat PS won with the support of communists and greens. This means that even though those parties did not get that many votes, their ideas will be represented. Can you imagine communists and greens influencing the decisions of Obama? While in the US there are 2 parties represented in congress, in France there are 7 in parliament. Going from Communists to Far Right. Could you see this in US?

Maybe there is alot of difference in ideology between Americans, but quite frankly, youre system makes it that only the most powerfull ideologies get at the top and have a chance of influencing decisions.

Rumheulen kann jeder....""sooo schlimm ist die englische küche nicht"". Das ist doch scheissegal, ob die ""sooo schlimm"" nicht ist...Fakt ist doch: egal wo du auf der Welt Menschen fragst, eine Mehrheit der Befragten wird England als das Land mit den miesesten Kochskillz benennen.

Der Grund warum heute Muttis scheinheilig das als ""Kochen"" bezeichnen ist doch nur, daß die gerne einen Schwiegersohn hätten oder sonst irgendwie gelangweilt sind.

Yes. My point is that voters in the caucuses and general pre-elections have direct influence over what strain of their party and which specific person is going into the votes, by choosing the delegates and the person to become nominated in the party. The vote Republican or Democrat is then not too important anymore imo. In the phase of pre-elections i'd even say that the variance between the candidates is comparably to that of different european parties. The parties don't differ much anyway (at least in Germany).  
 For those who'll downvote this post too: I'm not claiming the system is good or better than those in the EU countries.

&gt;the main ideology of both parties (the only 2 parties who are able to win anything in the US) are to a certain extent rather similar as they are both free market (what in Europe would be called ""liberal"" (as in pro-capitalist) parties)

They do the talk but neither Democrats nor Republicans are actually free market. As i have come to realize many areas are even more regulated and subsidized than in Europe. I guess the term *free market* has a good connotation in the US, so politicians will use it, but that's about it.  
 I'd definitely say Europe in general has more civil liberties, business-wise it's probably a bit more free in the US, but not by much.

&gt;Maybe there is alot of difference in ideology between Americans, but quite frankly, youre system makes it that only the most powerfull ideologies get at the top and have a chance of influencing decisions.

Eurovision used to be a serious song contest, but those days have long gone.

In Western Europe, no serious artist will apply to Eurovision, ever. You won't see popular international or even national hit artists in Eurovision. There is no Top 10 record sale artists. Eurovision music is not popular either. After ESC is over, it is largely forgotten until next year.

Artists which you see in Eurovision are:

- Comedic singers / bands / acts

- Amateurs who hope to get their careers started

- One act wonders (groups specifically established because of the ESC)

- Unsuccessful artists/bands, who try to gain fame (they are usually unsuccessful for obvious reasons: they are terrible)

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"Suppose that half of Spain's population -- lets use 25 million as a nice round number have 500 euros that are affected by this 3% VAT increase. This means 15 more euros per month will go to the government. Over 25 million people, this becomes 375 million euros per month.

So ok.. their revenues increase by that much every month for a few months.. until businesses who are no longer getting that 375 million start shutting down (could take 6-12 months)... then what happens is:

- Businesses close down
- Unemployment rises
- VAT revenues go back down again

Shouldn't they be trying to raise the amount of people buying stuff (ie. get a smaller slice of a bigger pie) rather than want a bigger slice of a smaller pie? Yes.. revenues will rise immediately for a few months, but as soon as more people start losing their jobs, the pie will shrink -- then these people will go onto unemployment benefits which will increase expenditure etc.

How can people find it a good idea to tax YOURSELVES to get more money when you don't have money? The money has to come from outside in the form of investments, tourism and exports.

This is not a debate of low taxes vs high taxes.. but about increasing taxes on yourselves when you have no money.

I think it needs more time to develop further. 

I'm not sure, though, that France still sees itself as a super power. I think rather that France WOULD like to be still a super power, but has realized that those times are over, and therefore tries to use the EU/CSDP framework as a ""lever"" to increase its global reach. France wants the EU to do what it alone is no longer able to. Undoubtedly, France sees itself as the leading nation on defence and security here.

I just said we have plenty of it. The fact that some are worse and most at the same level as us doesn't mean we don't have stuff to work on.

Aside from that, I think the large degree of homogenity in the Danish society combined with our general laid-back attitude can lead to a sort of casual racism, jokes etc. Not in a malevolent way, just if you haven't had much exposure to other cultures you might say or do hurtful or racist stuff without even realizing it. This is still just my own half-baked theory though, so take it with a grain of salt.

Also, I wouldn't really expect there to be a lot of racism in ghetto areas, precisely because people from different cultures actually interact there. I'm pretty sure a majority of DF voters live in rural areas.

&gt; Anyways I agree, get rid of this strange bureaucracy, heck even get rid of the different legal systems or atleast make it easier. But please stay away from cultural differences, it's not necessary to change these. Your commerce won't face problems if you just try to understand the cultural difference and cross language barriers. Just a bit of research and it's really no problem at all!

I'm not saying get rid of cultural differences, but something being ""culture"" is not a reason to protect it from outside influence (from which said culture probably came in the first place). Some ""culture"" is downright evil and should be gotten rid of. I'm not implying that this is your opinion, but I see it over and over again how ""culture"" is being used to justify certain behavior and thinking. This is only tangentially related to the topic, but important nonetheless.

The issue can be boiled down to a simple formula which has on one side the value of money and the other the value of diversity. The economy can be strengthened by reducing diversity because diversity in this case is a resistor, if you will, in the flow of commerce. By reducing this resistance, money will flow more freely and we will all be better off financially. It depends on the value you put on diversity, but there will come a point where the reduction in diversity yields less economic value than that of the lost diversity, and this point is the ideal balance between the two. My opinion is that we can lose a lot of diversity still that is of such low value to us that the economic yield will more than make up for it.

You can extend this formula to include political influence too. Diversity in various forms is one of the reasons we keep hearing the much overused and (in true European style) awkward phrase that ""Europe can't speak with one voice"". This in itself is not really much of a problem, in isolation the wish to ""speak with one voice"" is not much more than a feeling of embarrassment and belittlement when compared to the true world powers out there. But in the context of world politics and the shift of power currently underway it becomes a problem. Firstly, it's a problem for us, because less influence means we will have to, excusez mon français, bend over and take it much more than we do now, which will inevitably have a negative influence on us, individual Europeans. One might wish that the reality of world diplomacy wasn't so harsh, but it is. Secondly, it is a problem for humanity as a whole. This isn't some sort of group identity ""our culture is better than yours"", at least I try my best to not be too attached to the culture that initially formed my view of the world, but I do believe that certain ideas that are universally good and right are more appreciated in Europe and the Western world in general, and with lessened European/Western influence I believe these values will not be as prominent as they are now.",0,1342035675,null,0,false,0,c5clv1a,t3_wbbv6,t1_c5clv1a,t1_c5cjv60,null,1429351964,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I'm very skeptical of how this is a policy that will produce any medium or long term goals, the reforms that are supposed to be the goals of this policy are not reforms, they are cuts.

Long and medium term was how this was sold to the people, but I still need a explanation of how what is being implemented is going to work on the medium or long term. The revenue is dropping, the expenses are rising due to the unemployment and the economy is shrinking and shirking, how is that supposed to lead to anything positive? Making thousands of business going bankrupt will help the economy in the future exactly how? Forcing the young generation to leave the country that is one of the oldest (and has a very low natality) in europe is going to help the country n the future how? How is closing tribunals, hospitals and schools all over the country make the economy better? Is limiting the access to education, health and justice the way to a more competitive economy?

I'm just not seeing how this can have any sort of good outcome even in the long term, everyone in Portugal wanted reforms and were ready for sacrifices but what is being done is just stupid.

true,triceratopos,null,null,"Indeed it was achieved by constraining internal demand considerably, but it was somewhat necessary since before joining the EMU Portugal's floating currency would serve as stabilizer against trade imbalances. Imports had been booming out of control, the feeble Portuguese economy could not compete with other European countries through productivity nor could it resort to lower costs, as it had done before hand. Why is the trade balance important? A trade deficit has to be financed by debt to foreign entities, which is why Portugal for all intents and purposes has lost its economic sovereignty. The balance of trade is also a major indicator of economic health, it's not all about shiny double digit growth figures. It's probably something that hasn't been touted as the salvation of the country because it's a rather complex situation, portraying the situation in terms of public debt is just easier since it is probably the most immediate and visible dynamic.

In the case of Portugal, imports financed by debt had been used mostly for consumption and not so much for productive investments, which represents a huge structural issue. Correcting this problem requires a realignment of internal demand (via tariffs, for example), but under an EMU, and the EU in particular, a country cannot easily control for imports without also hurting the demand for domestic goods (which is why the argument in favor of wealth transfers across countries isn't completely retarded).  Besides adjusting the balance of trade, I reckon that the government has tried (or will) liberalize some key economic sectors (electricity, which was heavily subsidized), correct some labor rigidities, privatize some state enterprises and renegotiate the tax-payer extortion that are the public-private partnerships. Unfortunately, competition in Portugal is terrible and I can't see liberalization having strong positive results any time soon, but issues such as labor rigidities and subsidies that induced major economic distortions were long overdue. 

As for your other concerns, emigration helped Portugal achieve low balance of trade deficits in the past, through remittances, so while this is an unfortunate situation for those that are forced to move, it does have a macroeconomic silver lining. Cutting down on public services, however, isn't meant to make the economy better and if government propaganda aims to portray that, it's obviously not true, but when the state has limited resources it can also only offer limited services. Maybe something else could be cut? Something had to give, though.

In the end there are no magic pills and economic adjustments, mainly when the whole global economy is somewhat paralyzed, take awhile to have visible effects and even more so in the case of countries with extremely rigid labor markets. I'm sure more could be done, but on the Portuguese side there's corruption, lobbying, inertia and, most important, a huge constraint on which tools can be used. The EZ could do more, but they won't and I'm sure you are well aware of why that's not going to happen anytime soon.",0,1342056266,null,0,1342056513,0,c5cr07z,t3_we0mw,t1_c5cr07z,t1_c5cqbog,null,1429354389,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

As you read this, please remember that these are not my personal beliefs.

While many Christians say things like, ""I'm the sole survivor of the car crash - it's a miracle!  Praise God!,"" the Catholic Church regards such thinking as mere superstition.  There's an agency of the Church that investigates alleged miracles, and the Church only agrees that a miracle has occurred after this agency investigates.  The agency is primarily looking for signs of sainthood, as I understand it, and doesn't spend time investigating claims like, ""I wasn't killed by the hurricane - it's a miracle!""  Those claims are dismissed as wishful thinking.

&gt;The question remains why he doesn't use his omnipotence to prevent genocide, natural disasters, famine, etc.

The Church would say that God doesn't want to prevent suffering, he wants us to react properly when we suffer.  The suffering is intentional and is the punishment for original sin.

There are *general* speed limits and then there are *specific* speed limits. The first type works like this:

* The *standard* speed limit applies to all roads unless overridden by a more specific general limit.
* In most countries, there are at least two more general speed limits that apply to certain classes of roads: There is the *urban area* general speed limit, and then there's the *motorway* general speed limit. Some countries have general speed limits for *expressways* too.
* None of the general speed limits are posted explicitly, except for an overview sign when entering the country. These limits are *implied* by signs that tell you what type of road you're driving on.

Specific speed limits are given with the standard speed limit sign. These apply until another sign overrides or nullifies it, or, in some countries, until the next junction with another road.

The UK is badly needed imho.

Not the whole, just some parts. Many things are not too bad, but there is also much that was build out of national egoisms rather than to make Europe better.

I think the political shape of the union needs rebuilding anyway, and we need to have the President of the Council as the Head of State of Europe (whether they are called this or not) and the President of the Commission the Head of Government (EU Prime Minister) =&gt; or a system where these 2 roles exist differently to the institutions we have now.

true,[deleted],null,null,"All circumcisions carry a small risk.  It's a small percentage but every year people do die from a needless operation.  Blood poisoning sets, complications arise, that sort of thing.  The numbers are very small but they are there.  Not having control of your bladder/bowels or being able to clean yourself doesn't help.

A rabbi at a bris will rarely use anesthetic and they regularly do the operation themselves.  There is of course further complications and risk to sedating a small child.  It's not like abortion were back alley abortions are especially dangerous but the consequences of not doing it in a short window great,  it's a rabbi with a knife and they're regularly performed not in hospitals but synagogues and homes, presumably the same applies with Islam. - but technically you can have your foreskin cut whenever you want, there's no rush unlike abortion.  You can't abort a child in its 42nd trimester.  

If someone wants it done then let them choose it at 18, give them a party pack of oxycodone and penicillin and let them take a week off work, put their feet up and play X-box.  An 18 year old has a firing immune system, can keep himself clean, can understand what the pain is and can medicate himself accordingly and has his own mind to make decisions with.  Hell, he and his mosque/synagogue mates in the same year at school can even get it done at the same time so they can play x-box and get drunk/stoned together on the sofa for a week.  A baby can't even express itself or rationalise what it is going through.


                One out of every 77 male neonatal deaths in the US
                is a result of complications arising from circumcision. 

The male death rate from SIDS (cot death) is directly 1:1 comparable with the death rate from *elective* circumcision.
