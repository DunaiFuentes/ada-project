It would be interesting to see what would happen (for instance, in France, if the Île-de-France, which is also one of the richest regions in Europe, decided to go for independence).

You are wrongly inferring that being a rich area is the main reason Catalonia wants to leave...  Catalonia has before everything else a very strong identity, it's own language and it's own history (used to be basically independent 300 years ago). The spanish system give them some independence already.

Being rich enough just add technically to the possibility and is used as an argument to convince but it's not the main reason...

I am french and yeah there is absolutly no chance that ile de france would ask for independance, there is no identity attached to it... the part of france where there is a strong identity (enough to have the idea come to the mind off few people) are Corsica, Britanny and Savoy (which incidentally have their own differentiated culture/language/history) and there is close to 0% chance it ever happens as it would be a bad deal economically for them and the claim of independence has never been taken seriously by the local population (Brittany/Savoy) or has never received a significant support (Corsica).

true,Bardaf,cocarde,Libérateur,"Quelqu'un veut un résumé ?

00:00 : Intro bidon façon Fun Radio, je croyais que c'était soirée libre, pas soirée au Macumba.

03:20 : Oups, c'est déjà fini. Sylvain est pris de court et bafouille une excuse pour justifier son manque de préparation évident. Il continue avec son traditionnel ""Bien !"" pour introduire la nouvelle soirée libre. Il rit lorsqu’il précise qu'elle est filmée (et c'est vrai qu'il y a de quoi). Le public, une fois de plus venu en nombre, ou plutôt en chiffre, annonce avoir passé une bonne semaine.

4:10 : ""On va commencer avec la vidéo d'un chien qui mange un citron"" (rire à peine retenu). Gros cafouillage technique, la vidéo n'a pas commencé au début. Sylvain et ~~le public~~ sa copine commentent pendant la vidéo, on se croirait de plus en plus dans une émission de téléréalité sur leur vie privée. Prochain intitulé des Soirées Libres : Sylvain et sa copine naviguent ensemble sur entrefilet.

9:54 : ""Bien entendu."" Petite Confusion, puis enchainement magistral sur une histoire. ""Pour toi"", preuve que le public est assez... seul. L'histoire racontée par Sylvain dure environ trois minutes pour terminer sur le bide su siècle. ""J'avais pas dit que c'était une histoire drôle"" ""Ben t'aurais pu me prévenir"" ou tu aurais pu t'abstenir. J'ai de moins en moins envie de voir [le spectacle de Sylvain](http://fr.sylvain-vasseur.com/spectacle/).

20;10 : ""Et voilà, maintenant on se fait tous des bisous..."" suivi d'un dialogue fort intéressant où l'on apprend que Sylvain envoie des citations de Coco Chanel à sa copine, qu'elle les commente et qu'il croit qu'elle les lui a renvoyées. Jusqu'à maintenant je pensais que cette soirée était exceptionnellement sans drogues. Force est de constater que Sylvain en a bien pris. Une citation d'Oscar Wilde s'invite au milieu, suivie d'un lourd silence et d'un doigt tendu vers la caméra. Pauvre caméra, ce qui l'attend. Enchainement sur une vidéo 
de surfeurs qui se vautrent et font des figures dans l'eau en timelapse. Avaient-ils mangé du citron ?


[25:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJtla8m6gTM) : Le public se demande si c'est une blague.

26:15 : Nouvelle vidéo. On voit un type mettre le feu à un petit tas de poudre, le public demande ""C'est dans l'eau ?"" Ok, tout le monde a bien eu sa dose de drogues diverses. ""C'est particulier...""

27:38 : ""J'en avais une où le... Une vidéo où y a un type qui mettait queq'chose dans une tasse... Et au bout d'un moment ça faisait... PRLUTT !""

31:42 : C'est l'heure du ~~bisou~~ cadavre exquis ! Nouvelle preuve que la distribution de substances psychotropes a bien eu lieu. Sylvain garde son habitude de jeter les choses terminées et lance avec désinvolture le pauvre papier du cadavre exquis.

33:28 : Après avoir présenté la nouvelle vidéo à venir, Sylvain précise que le problème est que celui qui l'a montée a mis de la musique dessus (erreur de débutant que ne ferait jamais Sylvain) et comme ce n'est pas la [musique d'origine](http://www.thescienceofstyle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/High_School_Musical_I-come-with-my-own-background-music.jpg), Sylvain préfère regarder sans le son. Il est littéralement [en extase devant la vidéo](http://www.allposters.com/IMAGES/GB/MP0013.jpg). 
Par contre il a posé le micro et il fait plein de commentaires qu'on loupe au passage.

35:40 : Une soirée libre sans les Snorkies n'est pas vraiment une soirée libre. C'est là qu'on aurait préféré ne pas avoir le son. Le public s'insurge, ""On va pas y avoir droit toutes les semaines, non ?"" ""Ben pour l'instant, si, en fait !"" 

37:40 : Au plein milieu de l'interlude musical, Sylvain diffuse [une séquence d'une de mes séries préférées](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qurTK_0re3Y). 

48:11 : Le petit bonhomme en mousse. LE PETIT BONHOMME EN MOUSSE ! Le public dénonce un crime. Le public a souvent raison. Sylvain ne veut plus enchainer avec autre chose, on est à deux doigts d'avoir droit à un nouveau silence dont Sylvain à le secret et qu'il aime bien faire. Il décide finalement de mettre une chanson ""particulièrement particulière"". 

54:15 : ""Toutes les choses ont une fin, sauf la saucisse qui en a deux"" je la connaissais avec la banane, mais je suppose que c'est un rappel du cadavre exquis. La conclusion est rapide, une fois de plus ""il faut libérer Carthage"". On apprend qu'il n'y aura pas de soirée libre ce soir, il faudra donc attendre un peu avant une nouvelle.

Au final, pour reprendre un mot que Sylvain a beaucoup utilisé, c'était *[particulier](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32DP6-vgFlA)*.

Sylvain disparait souvent pour aller s'assoir, la sélection musicale est globalement moins bonne que d'habitude à mon sens, on fait une overdose des Snorkies, heureusement on a pas eu droit au [Coucou](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQhGnJn8e_Y&amp;t=0m34s).

Je précise que puisqu'il faudra attendre une semaine avant la prochaine soirée libre, je ferai le résumé de l'avant dernière (qui n'était de toutes façons pas terrible) dans le courant de la semaine.

Just kidding. I guess there's: 



Schlampe= bitch

Hurensohn = son of a bitch/whore

[Fotze](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xadtfq2bNJ0) = cunt

Wichser = wanker/jerk

Spasti/Spast = retard 

Arschloch = Asshole



So... Not so unusual actually. I searched for something [""unusual""](http://www.youswear.com/index.asp?language=German#.UG_dhU2M_Ik) and found ""Deine Mutter schwitzt beim Kacken"" = ""Your mother sweats when she shits"". We wouldn't REALLY use that as a serious insult though.

By the way ""Verfickte Scheiße"" (fucking shit) and the English word ""Fuck"" are also pretty common. 

Another edit: ""Fick dich"" (Fuck you), ""Fick dich ins Knie"" (Fuck you in the knee). Yup.

true,walen,ESPA,Spain,"To deeply offend a woman, you'd call her a ***puta*** (""whore""). This implies she's dirty and impure, a sinner, not to be trusted, unworthy of any man (not that I share this view but that's how it is).  
Consequently, this leads us to ***hijo de puta*** (""son of a whore""). Here in Spain it really is the worst thing you could say to ~~anyone~~ any man. Of course, any insult regarding his mother will do, but with ***hijo de puta*** you're also implying that his father is unknown, that he has no lineage/known family/nobility rights whatsoever; a very grave insult in the (patriarcal) Spanish society of the XV-XIX centuries which load perdures to this day.  
Now, there's a difference between ***hijo de puta*** and ***hijoputa***, the latter being a little (just a little) less offensive; enough to be used between close friends, as in: ""You bought a Ferrari? You *sunuvabitch*! Let's take a ride!"". So if you *really* want to insult someone, don't forget the ""de"" in the middle.

Note that for the Spanish versions I'm using ""whore"" and not ""bitch"". AFAIK ""bitch"" is a somewhat lighter word than ""whore"" in English. Thus, the equivalent for ""bitch"" in Spanish would be ***zorra*** (literally ""vixen"", but used mostly as ""bitch"" in English).



Now, if you're getting into a fight and really want someone to punch your face, you could say ***Me cago en tus muertos*** (literally ""I take a shit/dump on your dead relatives""). Now you're insulting not only him, but his whole family as well. Be careful with this one: if someone is hiding a pocket knife, this insult could very well make them use it.



Some more. There's this kind of insults known as ""the truth hurts"" :P Clearest example: if you know someone's being cheated on, calling him/her a ***cornudo***/***cornuda*** (literally ""with horns"") is a sure hit. Another relatively strong insult may be ***subnormal*** (literally ""retarded"").  
And finally we have ***gilipollas***: the meaning is a mix between ""dick"" and ""asshole"", but not exactly. Not really strong either, but very used.

Seulement aujourd'hui tout cela est menacé par l'explosion de notre dette publique. Explosion due au fait qu'on dépense toujours plus (1) sans augmenter les recettes en parallèle (2).

Sur le point (1), il est de la responsabilité des politiques de réduire nos dépenses publiques, ce que prone The Economist.

On augmente toujours plus le poids de l'Etat en créant des structures inutiles... la liste est longue.

Mostly because I'm a European federalist, and the best way forward I see for federalism in Europe is to create a ""Europe of regions"", and regions demanding their independence are the best way to topple the nation-states that I'd like to see disappear (and possibly replace the silly concept of citizenship with that of place-of-residence).

To find a job here is not very hard atm, as long as you are qualified to a ""certain level"" - we have enough unqualified people here.

Scholarships exist, but are often hard to get.
But: in german universities there is no tuiton fee (except in the states bavaria and lower saxony, but that may change, too), so it is not THAT hard to study here.
In most cities where you can study you will find a room (for students) for about 200-250€ all included (water, heat, internet, energy).
So if you get a normal student's job here (mostly paid around 10-12€ per hour) you could be fine with working around 15hs per week while studying (I did and do so, 16 hs atm).


ok, so, if you only want to study here, there exist many courses in english. So if you come to study and leave again, you don't neccessarily need to learn german.
If you want to work here, learn german before you come, it will make everything so much easier for you.

I think there's absolutely no doubt about that.  Were it only for the fact that, to sit at the EU Council or send members to the EU Parliament there has to be a treaty deciding how many votes and how many members you get.

The question of citizenship is more subtle: unless the provisions for independence allow residents of Catalonia to *choose* between Spanish and Catalan citizenship (which is *not* the usual way it's done to break up a country, assuming there's such a thing as a ""usual"" way), there are bound to be lots of nasty legal arguments before Spanish courts and the ECJ brought by people claiming to be unjustly deprived of their citizenship on basis of place of residence.  It will be interesting to see what happens.

&gt; Spain will veto it most likely.

I don't think so.  Not only would it be petty, it would also be bad economic strategy: even if Spain is bitter about Catalonia leaving, their best interest is to keep strong economic ties, and a common currency if possible.

However, Spain will most likely *threaten* to veto Catalonian membership in the EU, either to prevent independence altogether, or at least to get it on the best terms it can.

The first given reason for this negativity is '*Public spending*.' It's 57% of GDP, ""*more even than in Sweden*"" apparently. Horror of all horrors! But wait, Sweden is not so bad as a country. Actually, despite its huge taxes on the rich, given the choice between living in civilised Sweden and living in England (poverty-stricken worker-ghettoes and all), which would you prefer? 

The second '*weakness*' given for France is a '*competitiveness gap with Germany*'. And here we are told the same old ultra-capitalist story: ""*This is chiefly linked to rigid labour-market rules and payroll charges on employers, which between them keep labour costs high and deter job creation.*""

Lets us then look at competitiveness. In the latest (arguably '*right-wing*' ) [World Economic Forum global competitiveness report](http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2012-2013/), they placed France at 22. That's pretty bad. So the Economist does seem to have a point. 

But then again, according to the WEF, the top five countries are: Switzerland, Singapore (the only non-European country), Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands. Hmm! Sweden is here, Germany (though at 6th barely) not. But the point is that Sweden is doing even better than Germany. Why would the Economist use it as a negative example? Let's see: 

England manages to crawl up to 8th place, following (as always) right behind the USA(7th). But it does so by becoming a complete corporate-whore of a country, one that betrays its subjects to favour '*business*', guts almost all labour-market rules and denies its workforce most of the social benefits available to the Germans for example (never mind the Swedes or the French). And despite all that, England does not managed to overtake Sweden, a socialist paradise of a country.

So WTF? What is the Economist's point? It's the Swiss, Finish, Swedish or Dutch models that seems to be the (civilised) path of choice here, not England's.

The answer is a simple one: the government is now putting the costs of subsidizing at the cities while at the same time not giving those cities more money to be able to do so. A relocation of responsibilities that is in truth nothing more than a filthy way of fixing the national governments budget, but screws over the local budgets. The government will regret having done so within twenty years when they realize they signed away more and more power (in the form of responsibilities) to the EU and local governments. And the local governments will remember how the big government screwed them over.


But when it comes to the cities actually taking measures to crack down on the amount of requests for aid: Rotterdam already managed to filter out an amazing amount of leechers. That is good, I suppose. The question now is what those leechers will be doing to provide for themselves. With police budgets being cut I'm afraid it will lead to more crime that the cities won't be able to handle. Throw a European crisis into the mix and the fact that costs of living are rising a lot (the Dutch are raising all kinds of taxes which in turn also make the insurers and such increase the prices: those with little to no money get double screwed) and I can see why more and more middle-class and up families are moving away from the Randstad.

She will not stick out like a sore thumb, Nürnberg is a trade fair, Tourist oriented city, If she is just for business here she will not have much problems regarding the language, every major orientation sign is in English too. 

Subway and train announcements are bi-lingual at the central stations. If she aims for the younger people she will have a high chance that she can speak English (well what they consider English) with them.

We got many African and Asian people, the migration rate is around 30% of non-Germans. Only thing she has to watch out for is flocks of young Russian and/or Turkish boys, they tend to be a bit cheeky, but mostly harmless to women.

As for your lack of knowing German culture: Germans LOVE order, which does not mean that is it there all the time, but the wish is there. Which anecdotally leads to the fact that even pedestrians stick to the right side of the sidewalk, so they wont bump into each other or have a ""little"" dance to decide who goes where. Traffic signs MUST be obeyed, by everyone(!).  I have to agree with ""fffggghhhnnn"" that the only slight dangerous points can be very late at night on a weekend when people are drunk, Sometimes the neo-nazis rise from the dust then, but the police is not far, and very alert of this situations. 

Nürnberg is a (i guess for an Indian) pretty small city of a half million people (calculating the suburbs in). People that talk to each other on the street are rarely full Germans, They tend to speak a bit lower in volume then your average world person (ok this is more of a European thing i admit). That is one of the few things that can lead you to stick out.

Plus, yes she should pack for very cold and rainy days.

Here's a fact for you: Rotterdam cannot pay for all the subsiduaries and aid that is being requested by its populace. Rotterdam now has to pay that out of its own pockets. The solution is that cities cut heavily in their subsidiaries and aid budgets by filtering out as many people as possible through measures described in this article. Schiedam, where I grew up, started with these policies. If Rotterdam does not do this, the city will go bankrupt in a couple of years. 


I am anything but a neo-liberal, but your approach to this is precisely what's wrong Dutch society at the moment. You need to reach out to others and together get to the needed solutions. When others fail, you need to learn from their mistakes and not gloat because of whatever differences you might have with them. Such gloating will only frustrate future co-operation. And the necessity for future co-operation is a given.


Maybe I'm being too hard on you, maybe I'm being an ass, but it seems to me that you haven't been paying attention to how the national government has been shifting budgetary responsibilities to the cities whilst not giving them the necessary tools to deal with them. Cities can either cut or raise/increase taxes themselves. The latter is already happening, but ain't enough to cross the gap. That's why the former is also happening and it's not driven out of any kind of ideology but out of necessity: it is pompen of verzuimpen for a whole lot of randstad cities.

It has nothing to do with 'Leefbaar' really, but with the financial reality :/


edit - Oddly enough, this also hasn't gained a whole lot of media attention nor did it get any kind of attention during the elections.

I think this illustrates the importance of Regional/State governments directly taxing and spending in their own area of authority.

&gt;Nur wenige arbeitsmarktpolitische Maßnahmen in den Hartz-Gesetzen haben Arbeitslosen den Einstieg in eine neue berufliche Tätigkeit bisher erleichtert. In weiten Teilen habe die Reform ihr Ziel verfehlt, für eine Belebung des deutschen Arbeitsmarktes zu sorgen. 

&gt;Insbesondere die Einrichtung von PSA habe sich als untaugliches Arbeitsmarktinstrument erwiesen. Einige PSA-Beschäftigte seien sogar noch später in den Arbeitsmarkt integriert worden als vergleichbare Arbeitslose. Darüber hinaus führe ein Beschäftigter in einer PSA zu durchschnittlichen Mehrkosten von 5700 Euro – ohne Verbesserung der Beschäftigungschancen. Deshalb hat die Bundesregierung im Januar die Arbeitsagenturen von der Pflicht entbunden, eine PSA einzurichten. Auch der Vermittlungsgutschein wurde von den Wissenschaftlern schlecht beurteilt.

- you must never have benefited from the working-holiday program in France
- over 18, under 30 at the time of asking for the visa
- no dependent children traveling with you
- you have a valid passport
- you have medical insurance covering sickness, pregnancy, invalidity and hospitalization for the duration of your stay
- at entry in France, prove that you have either a ticket back to Australia or the means to buy one
- at entry in France, prove that you have the means to subsist for a while (the French embassy can tell you the minimum amount in the last two items)

Even if you fulfill all the conditions, the visa may be refused for ""health or public order reasons"", which means whatever pretext they might want to come up with. The mention of health also might lead to the embassy asking for some medical info.

There's a yearly quota of such visas, so this might also be opposed to you as a reason for denying the visa.

Visa is valid for 12 months from delivery, and for multiple entries. Time of allowed residency in France is maximum 12 months. You're forbidden from getting another residency status in France during that time: if you want to stay longer, you have to get back to Australia and ask from there for another visa/residency status.

Once you've found a job, you have to go get an *autorisation de travail* (work permit) from the French administration. It is valid for the initial duration of the contract, and can be renewed as long as you remain under the 12-month limit of stay. They have to give it to you, but the delay might be longer than you think.

You're forbidden to engage in a regulated profession in France (doctors, lawyers, architects, accountants, etc.) By the way, teaching in high-schools is a regulated profession... (But teaching for a private employer is not)

You won't get any benefit (sick leave, retirement account, etc.) of the French system. But you'll have to pay taxes on your salary to finance it.

The most important advice I can give you as a lawyer: **DO NOT OVERSTAY**! The French are getting tighter and tighter with residency rules, and getting on the wrong side of that law might prevent you from re-entering anywhere in the Schengen area for a very long time.

Two notes on the competitiveness angle, though. First, Switzerland, Finland, Sweden, and the Netherlands, combined, make up only about 32 million people, less than half that of France. Save the Netherlands, they are all far less cosmopolitan and diverse than France. This enables those countries to remain agile and change more easily. Second, Germany's being sixth to France's 22nd is extremely relevant because of the common market. If a business has the choice between locating in France and locating in Germany, there are no barriers to prevent it from selling to customers in one or the other country. While France's demographic trends give it an advantage, it does still have to put in place policies that will allow people to enter the marketplace. Having a healthy birth-rate goes from blessing to curse when those young people grow up and cannot find work.

Original comment:
&gt;Die Exaktheit der Zahlen täuscht über ihre eingeschränkte Aussagekraft hinweg. Denn es gibt sie auch im Bologna-Zeitalter noch: Die Studenten, für die das Studium keine Berufsausbildung, sondern ein Experimentierfeld ist. Durch die drastisch gestiegenen Studierendenzahlen fallen sie nur nicht mehr so stark ins Gewicht wie zu Twains Zeiten, in denen weniger als 1 Prozent der Bevölkerung über ein Abitur verfügte, oder in den 60er Jahren, wo die Quote gerade einmal bei gut 5 Prozent lag.
&gt;
&gt;Sicher: Bachelor und Master schränken die Freiheit in der beliebigen Wahl von Lehrveranstaltungen stark ein - völlig unmöglich machen sie ein interessengeleitetes Studium aber nicht. Das schreibt hier einer, der sein BA/MA-Studium sehr individuell (d.h. vom Muster-Stundenplan deutlich abweichend) gestaltet hat und trotzdem in der Regelstudienzeit und mit bestem Ergebnis fertig geworden ist.
&gt;
&gt;Umgekehrt war ein ""Studium nach Vorschrift"" auch in der Vergangenheit nie die Ausnahme, sondern immer die Regel. Mainstream-Studenten, die ihrem akademischen Abschluss pragmatisch, opportunistisch und auf dem Weg des geringsten Widerstands entgegenstudierten, machten zu allen Zeiten die Mehrheit der Immatrikulierten aus - bereits zu Lebzeiten Hegels stellte dies ein gewisser Arthur Schopenhauer am eigenen, leeren Hörsaal fest.
&gt;
&gt;Daneben ist Uni von heute - so böse das klingen mag - auch ein Auffangbecken für all jene, denen der nicht-universitäre Ausbildungs- und Arbeitsmarkt keine Optionen bietet. Nicht selten wird die Frage nach der Motivation für den Hochschulbesuch mit Verweis auf den trüben Arbeitsmarkt beantwortet. In dieser Personengruppe ist die Wahrnehmung des Studiums als Berufsausbildung besonders stark ausgeprägt. Noch drastischer ausgedrückt: Ohne die Hochschulen mit ihren überfüllten Hörsälen und ihrem - zumindest teilweise - sehr fragwürdigen Angebot an neuen Studiengängen wäre die Arbeitslosenzahl noch viel höher, als sie es aktuell ist. Nach erfolgtem Abschluss wird der schöne Schein mit unbezahlten Praktika und anderen ""Maßnahmen"" munter aufrecht erhalten.

true,KevinUxbridge,null,null,"Can't really argue against reasonable, sensible and well presented. I just want to  add that I have an issue with how the WEF understands ""*competitiveness*"". It is not necessarily what one might think. It's an ultimately hyper-capitalist understanding of it. In the report, you can read:

&gt;The *quality* of institutions has a strong bearing on
competitiveness and growth.  It influences investment
decisions and the organization of production and plays
***a key role in the ways in which societies distribute the
benefits and bear the costs of development strategies
and policies***. For example, ***owners of land, corporate
shares, or intellectual property*** are unwilling to invest in
the improvement and upkeep of their property if *their
rights as owners* are not protected. 
The role of institutions goes beyond the legal
framework. Government attitudes toward markets
and *freedoms*(sic)  ...

Reading between the lines here and elsewhere, one can see that the WEF considers it desirable to distribute the costs of development strategies and policies to society, while concentrating benefits to investors. Accordingly it can rate an economically polarised Medieval-minded (but '*investment friendly*') country like Saudi Arabia as more *competitive* than France. But is it really?

It takes a rather peculiar (though quite common in economics) mindset to think of autocratic oil-filled regimes, like Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as ... ""*competitive*""! According to such a mentality, an economy could even be some feudal slave-trading hell-hole, but nonetheless be considered '*competitive*'. It would also thus be implied to be economically ... '*desirable*' . That, however, is **not** how I personally understand ""*desirable*"".

And as for *the Economist* magazine itself, I have many issues with it. But it unfortunately is the best, most intelligent, mainstream English-language magazine out there.

Who said it has no proven record?!

Multiculturalism is ~~only~~ a natural outcome of immigration. It is important, for example to saturated economies like the developed countries, because it gives an 'outsider' perspective on how things are working. It also brings in fresh ideas to support the limited growth of those economies. Add to that, immigrants/expats tend to advertise the image of the countries they migrated to, to the people from the countries they migrated from; something that has political and economic implications (positive or negative based on their experiences). This is so apparent and doesn't need research to figure out. I'm an expat living in Finland, for example. I may not be as loyal to Finland as I am to my country, but naturally I encourage my friends and family to buy Finnish products and brands. Same with political values and traditions, which will ultimately contribute to a better relationship with both countries.

On the other hand, I am coming from a background with a very different set-up. I have insights about problems and solutions from two different backgrounds, this alone can contribute to the growth of, let's say, the company I work for. Also, my early years may prove difficult, specifically in finding a job, due to many reasons that includes language, for instance. This, in many cases, means that I have more drive to start my own business, creating jobs to citizens of the country I live in. [You can read a little about the link between immigrants and the rise of entrepreneurial activities](http://www.entrepreneurship.org/en/policy-forum/immigration-and-entrepreneurship.aspx), or even about how [40% of the fortune 500 companies are founded by immigrants or their children](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2011/06/19/40-percent-of-fortune-500-companies-founded-by-immigrants-or-their-children/).

Besides, one can claim that one of the reasons behind multiculturalism is the same reason that people like to travel abroad; being exposed to different cultures and backgrounds. We are living in one world after all, those of us who would have a bigger impact, are the ones who know, or wanna know more about the 'others'.

true,armyn1,BRAN,Brandenburg,"Zumindest dem letzten Argument, dass das Studium zu einer Beschäftigungsmaßnahme in Zeiten struktureller Arbeitslosigkeit geworden ist, stimme ich teilweise zu.

In diesem Zusammenhang muss aber auch darauf hingewiesen werden, dass in Zeiten von Hyperproduktivität, Automatisierungen und Outsourcing sich die Berufsfelder verändert haben. Es gibt selbst im hoch-industriellen Deutschland kaum Fabriken, die noch große Massen an industriellen Proletariern angestellt haben. Die Arbeitsfelder von heute sind auf Büro-, Computer-, Verwaltungs- und generell auf Gedankenarbeit ausgerichtet. Dies ist auch ein wichtiger Grund, warum Viele zum Studium gehen.

Nicht ohne Grund möchte die EU die europäischen Länder [re-industrialisieren](http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/eu-kommission-will-dritte-industrielle-revolution-a-859794.html). 
Der Spiegel-Titel der ""Dritten industriellen Revolution"" ist natürlich eine Farce. Diese begann schon in den 1970er, kann auch als ""Mikroelektronische Revolution"" bezeichnet werden und hat die Produktivität dermaßen erhöht, dass die meisten Arbeiter überflüssig wurden und jetzt in der ""Dienstleistungsgesellschaft"" ihren Platz finden.
Deshalb ist das Studium nicht ausschließlich eine Beschäftigungsmaßnahme, sondern selbst ein (Krisen-)Phänomen der Dienstleistungsgesellschaft.

In diesem Zusammenhang wird natürlich die Konkurrenz des Arbeitsmarktes schon auf das Studium vor verlagert.

At its time it was a very progressive justice system). Also I'm strictly against genital mutilation of any kind. But these are antiquated aspects of african/muslim culture. But it's the same as christian extremism, which still exists. The laws laid out in the bible (especially the old testament) are as cruel as old African tribe laws. 

Actually I would be totally fine with replacing medieval christian buildings with mosques from the same time. They're not only better buildings regarding the techniques used to build it. Also the decoration is evidence of a far advanced culture and civilization. It's not christianity that makes Europe a better place to live that the Middle East right now. It's all about the economy, which is a result of education. Actually education and equality is the key to every single problem of Europe's problems. I can tell you, based of my own experience, that African or Muslim heritage doesn't hinder people to participate well in society and add to European culture. The problem with all these immigrants is that they are unloved.

Yes, there are studies that are heavily suggesting that immigrants have a worse chance getting a job at equal qualification. If you wouldn't get a job even though you are well qualified, you and your children won't believe in education. This is a vicious circle. Since it would be against every principle of European culture to kick these people out (this is the kind of culture you find superior to muslim culture), we have to educate them to keep the living standards high and the criminality low without creating a police state.

 European culture is a mixture between different cultures. Living in Berlin I would miss Italian or French as well as Turkish or Syrian restaurants. I like greek buildings as well as the New Synagogue. I think a task for Europe is to pick out the good things about other cultures and include them and think and communicate with the people about the bad things. This is how keep and expand the cultural superiority of Europe. It's not about rejecting it's about including different cultures.

They did not fire their regular street crews, you can't simply fire people and rehire them for a lower wage in the Netherlands, you'd need to get permission from a court to do this (which they would never get without a good reason, especially not a local government). The only way they can do something like this is letting contracts expire, then six months after they've been unemployed they can rehire them on new terms (otherwise their old contract has to be renewed). This however only applies to people with temporary contracts, since many people have contracts that don't expire (unlimited time contracts).

However, you could argue that the unemployed people who are now working for 'free' (if they don't their unemployment benefits are cut or canceled) with the street cleaning crews are occupying jobs.

He says youth from immigrant backgrounds cannot fully integrate into British culture and that there are communities living segregated from mainstream UK society. And nobody is doing anything about it, to make these people integrate fully into society. 

Sometimes, it's not a problem. For example, I am Greek Cypriot born and raised in UK and I don't feel British at all - so I am an example of what Cameron is saying. He is correct and I agree with him - I do not feel British at all. But, I respect the laws, I am a good citizen and I believe in the UK society. 

The problem is when people cannot integrate because they find a cultural barrier which prevents them from following authority in the country e.g. when people disobey UK law and force Shariah law to be looked at as an alternative in areas with high immigrant population.

&gt;Sharia was (maybe) progressive 1400 years ago, yet even vikings knew gender equality. Genital mutilation of children is a common practice among africans and muslims right now, not antiquated. Not a single country uses old testamental legislation.
Of course, I don't call for a justice system based on the sharia. But saying ""muslims are bad because they use the sharia"" is an ignorant statement. Laws in Europe before the Enlightenment were way more arbitrary and cruel than the sharia is today. The sharia follows a different approach to justice than modern, European systems. It's draconic, just like pre-enlightened systems everywhere in the world. The reforms that have been made aren't there in Islam because liberal approaches have been destroyed. This is exactly how it would've been like in Europe if the Thirty-Years War hadn't happened and all the (non-secular) governments had been strong. 
I'm not obsessed enough to replace old buildings just like that for personal preferense reasons.
Also, I don't want to actually replace buildings. It's just so, that certain people think they're inherently better than others, which is not the case. The Blue Mosque is IMO equal to the St. Peter's Basilica. It's not that European/Christian culture is worth more than Middle-Eastern/Muslim culture (and this aspect is part of the question)
Based on statistics &amp; news african or muslim heritage does prevent academic success, especially among females. 
The opposite is true for those of east-asian heritage. So much for immigrants simply ""not being loved"".

It's really not that hard. Of course statistics say all these things that you just stated, but it won't explain the reason behind it. I know for sure in Germany and I suspect the same for other European countries that most Muslim/African immigrants came here to work. In Germany, these were poor farmers from Anatolia, for France's case, they were mostly unemployed/hungry people from the former colonies. They didn't come with a lot and they came for a better life. Europeans did the wrong thing. In most countries, immigrants were just ignored and left alone. On the other hand, most people from the Far East were educated. Of course they had better chances and the public had a better picture of them. But when you're saying that they are better immigrants than Muslims, you're just partly right. Uneducated Chinese would be just as much a problem as uneducated Arabs. And it's not even different for European countries. If I placed ignorant and uneducated Germans, probably from the countryside into London or Paris or Rome, they wouldn't be less trouble as Turks. It's all about the first impression. Educated immigrants, who came educated are ""loved"" and uneducated immigrants who might want education are left ""unloved"". I'm pretty sure, you can't find any example saying the opposite. 

&gt;Again, see east-asians usually have lower unemployment than the aboriginal population. Your hypothesis of some kind of inherent racism of society preventing different people from achieving doesn't hold water in that context. The vicious cycle of under-education and alienation begins with culture.

I'm pretty sure, you're wrong here. I've personally met very educated people from Muslim background. And considering immigration related problems in the United States, Christians (Mexicans) can be uneducated too and cause problems just as well as Muslims do in European cities. It's not Religion or culture, it's economic development. When there was a broad wealth in the Middle East, they were the most progressive people on the planet. When Europe became rich through colonisation, Europe became, over time, more educated and more progressive. 

&gt;You think that ""pick out the good things about other cultures and include them"" is some kind of ""task for europe"", yet you failed to mention the main question: what can we actually learn?

This whole question is not a serious question. You can see this by looking at the top comment. It's rather a circlejerk for all the people that see minorities and problems in the society and go for the easy prey. Of course, we learned a lot from Muslims and sub-saharan Africans regarding food, music and art, just as they would if we went there. Xenophobia is in any event the wrong way to answer the questions raised by immigration.

To be pedantic, it is 0 to 9 actually.

And the idea of positional decimal mark too arose out of India. Indians wrote the positional decimal mark as an 'overbar', which changed to the 'point' over time.

This idea of zero and positional decimal mark were the key contributions by Indians. The rest of the numeral system could easily have been built out of other components from other cultures.

Many Sikh women born and raised in the UK have marriages arranged by their parents from someone back home in India. They can't refuse and they can't divorce otherwise they would dishonour their family. The only way out for some of them is by jumping in front of a train. We have one of the highest suicide by train rates in the UK.

In my Somali community arranged marriages happen all the time. However it's not forced. If you say no they'll find someone else, however it's frowned upon to say yes and then say no at the last minute. 

The main reason is honour. It's such a prevalent system that has no basis in religion. It's widespread in the Middle East,Central and South Asia.

You can't even define a partial order of values of cultures, even from some culture's POV, because cultures are multi-dimensional. Example:

One culture cherishes hospitality, but also eating little babies. The other abhors hospitality, but also abhors eating little babies. The normative framework of the culture we're using as POV sees hospitality and not eating babies as positive.

We can try to define an ordering by defining a total order on those two dimensions, say, we decide that we care more about not eating babies than about hospitality.

However: 

1. There might be behaviours we can't put into a total, only partial, order, see any moral dilemma.

The two questions in the article are easy to answer - we would stay on sterling (the SNP had floated the idea of joining the Euro, but do not advocate that any more), and the responsibility for bailing out Scottish banks would lie with the Scottish government (the Bank of Scotland that he mentions is actually part of HBOS, an English bank: the Royal Bank of Scotland is the one that required the significant bail-out, however that is essentially a UK institution - 100% of their tax revenue went to the UK government, and the takeover that landed them with so much debt was approved by the UK financial regulator).

The other question often floated inside the UK is if there would be border controls due to joining the Schengen area. There wouldn't - we would remain outside Schengen, as per the UK, and remain inside the existing Common Travel Area (a pre-Schengen intra-UK+Ireland travel arrangement).

Nobody in Scotland is seriously proposing leaving the EU; Eurosceptic politicians are more commonly associated with the right-wing Conservative and UKIP parties, neither of which have significant roles in Scottish politics.

I am sure there will be some negotiation as to exactly how things play out, but given that England is the most euro-sceptic part of the UK it would seem to be in Scotland and the EU's interest for the transition to be as smooth as possible (i.e., if we had to be given some special exemption to carry on some of the UK's historical opt-opts, letting those run on for another 10-20 years would be beneficial to both sides).

The EU is nothing if not pragmatic: strictly speaking new states do have to follow one set of rules, but this ""new"" state would have seceded from an existing state (and has existed as a nation since long before that).

- The wikipedia article on Doner-Kebab says that it goes back to Ottoman times. Sure, there is a German-version of it developed by immigrants, but so are other versions of Doner all over the world - Doner is not reserved German word.
The article on ""Kebab"" says: 

*Döner kebab, literally ""rotating kebab"" in Turkish, is sliced lamb, beef or chicken, slowly roasted on a vertical rotating spit. The Middle Eastern shawarma, Mexican tacos al pastor and Greek gyros are all derived from the Turkish döner kebab which was invented in Bursa in the 19th century by a cook named Hacı İskender*

Another thing is that very many people attack the base idea rather than the interpretation of implimentation of it, which makes for very odd situations where people decry 'socialism', 'multiculturalism' and 'egalitarianism' because some bureaucrats made the wrong call about school-lunches in Sweden. 

Those aren't the problem; I can not believe anyone is honestly arguing that the thought of ""equality could be nice"" is the problem. It's rather clear that the implimentation there was done wrongly. I also ranted a bit this morning against the seemingly increasing tendency of boiling down complex issues to ""haha, oh those lefties"". I'd like to call on anyone to not do that. There's idiots on the left, there's idiots on the right, there's idiots above us, there's idiots below us. 

There's liberal idiots, there's conservative idiots, there's socialist idiots, there's Muslim idiots, there's Christian idiots, there's atheist idiots, but people in this subreddit all too often go ""that's because he's liberal/socialist/muslim/conservative"" rather than ""that's because he's an idiot."" It seems too non-specific to engage the entire 'side' or ideology you percieve someone to be on rather than the person or their party themselves or itself.

&gt; In Europe, the Muslim share of the population is expected to grow from 6% of the region’s inhabitants in 2010 to 8% in 2030.
    In 2030, Muslims are projected to make up more than 10% of the total population in 10 European countries (Kosovo (93.5%), Albania (83.2%), Bosnia-Herzegovina (42.7%), Republic of Macedonia (40.3%), Montenegro (21.5%), Bulgaria (15.7%), Russia (14.4%), Georgia (11.5%), France (10.3%) and Belgium (10,2%)).    
    
Looking at the demographics, I don't expect the 8% of muslims (or 10% in France and Belgium) in 2030 to carry any more electoral weight in Western European countries than the 6% does now.

If you're a well integrated immigrant who contributes to society then you shouldn't be fazed by what we ""fascists"" say.

 I can only speak for myself but I can tell you that I have nothing against good non-white immigrants, with that said I do believe that non-white immigration needs to be much more well regulated, since it's very important that we preserve our racial homogeneity and we don't really need non-white immigration with the amount of natives that are unemployed. There should also be a zero tolerance policy towards immigrants: you don't follow our laws, you're deported. None of that bullshit about ""We should help integrate these poor souls by throwing taxpayer money at them!"".

And unless you were having an oddly coherent fit at the keyboard I presume that when you typed it you thought you were saying something understandable, that you understood. If you try hard to remember what you thought you were saying then, you'll answer your own question.

&gt;*The people we are talking about are living in our countries and they won't go away*

Yup, we're not expecting that. What we're suggesting is that perhaps multiculturalism has to some extent failed. And that in the same way we can accept that our culture has progressed over time, so that our Western culture in the West now is superior to that before, say slave emancipation and the extension of the vote to women; so might cultures be more or less admirable across geographical and social space.

&gt;*There's no harm in headscarves.*

I can immediately think of two ways in which there might be harm. Three ways. Four ways. To wit:

* Cultural pressure on women to conform that they won't be able to escape
* Maintenance of a 'them and us' attitude
* Persistence of a medieval superstition
* Anachronistic and patriarchal view of female modesty and sexuality.

I'm sure there are others.

Indeed, Islamic civilisations (and this term doesn't equal to 'Muslims') learned much from Greek, Roman, Persian, Byzantine, Indian, Egyptian civilisations, but beside collecting and synthesizing, they significantly developed that knowledge. 

Mankind can be eternally grateful for this. Much of that knowledge could have been lost in the bloody mess of the Migration Period and the early Middle Ages and in 2012 A.D. we weren't debating on reddit.

However, I don't think that technological and scientific progress is directly linked to religion - although we know some unfortunate exceptions.

The Arab world has seen rough times for quite a while, and the 'Western civilisations' are not really innocent in this.

 
These conditions are obviously inappropriate for scientific development, so it's little wonder that Qatar spends vast amounts of money to attract scientists and engineers from Europe and not the other way around.

That wasn't a random picture, that is arguably the person within the EU that has the most power and he's Portuguese. You mentioned the Portuguese are blacks and then I just commented on his blackness.

I have sexy brown eyes. There's this one chick from Erasmus with blue eyes that I think digs me. If I get lucky, next week I'll be on her. I'll leave you wondering how awesome it would be if we had a child and it was black (like me) and with blue eyes (like her). :)

Staff is French, friendly, and at least one of them speaks English that I know of.

The other good place would be Sugarplum Cake Shop, where you often find students studying or using laptops.  The filter coffee is delicious, and free refills are available.  It's located at 68 Rue du Cardinal Lemoine.  They have free WiFi, but it's not available on the weekends. Power outlets available, but it gets crowded. Their cookies and cakes are incredible. The staff is comprised of American college girls studying in Paris.

The third place would probably be Adèle's Family at 67 Rue d'Argout, although I am unsure about their WiFi situation, and I don't know if they have any power outlets available. It is a great place to take a book and read or write.  Coffee is cheap and free refills are available.  Lots of good, cheap menu items.  It's an American café and epicerie, so as you can imagine, they speak French and English. It's tiny, but off the beaten path, and only gets crowded sometimes at lunch.

&gt;Dog-whistle politics is political messaging employing coded language that appears to mean one thing to the general population but has an additional, different or more specific resonance for a targeted subgroup. The phrase is only ever used as a pejorative, because of the inherently deceptive nature of the practice and because the dog-whistle messages are frequently themselves distasteful, for example by empathizing with racist attitudes. It is an analogy to dog whistles, which are built in such a way that their high-frequency whistle is heard by dogs, but is inaudible to humans.",0,1349640517,null,0,false,0,c6j0m2q,t3_113a2w,t1_c6j0m2q,t1_c6izzbu,null,1435679906,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

When however a country finds itself with a stable, if slightly lop-sided infrastructure that is also meant to prop up a stable indigenous population with the odd mixture of first and second generation immigrants who have more or less been assymiliated, then the arrival of many new faces desperate enough to under-cut the locals, will upset that balance and cause unrest.

Furthermore, joining the EU as a member in our own right was seen as a massive step in becoming a truly independent nation, as up until then we had largely acted on the world stage either through Britain or not at all. So to leave the Union now because the British do so would be massively retrograde.

And of course, there is the fact that we are in the eurozone, so trying to untangle ourselves from that knot would be very difficult.

People like this praise their 'culture' and their 'values' in comparison to their misconstrued opinion of other 'cultures'. They're avoiding the real issue here. It has nothing to do with culture, it's all about socioeconomic background. Poor British people will resort to violence (think hooligans) just as much as poor immigrants. It just so happens that the British economy uses immigrants for jobs that don't allow workers to get out of financial misery. Some British people are caught in the middle. The wealthier people call them peasants. This is valid for every other european country, btw.

true,muupeerd,NETH,The Netherlands,"There seem to be some folks that continiously post racist comments, BUT:

Do not mistake racism with [statistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime). 

Political correctnes has gone too far when anyone pointing to ''negative'' statistics concerning immigrants (/culture/country/immigrants/foreigners etc is immidiately called a racist. 


Now then, I'm not against immigration if it goes hand in hand with integration. Placing people in ''groups'' for research enables us to look at the bigger picture and see patterns. With that we can also see which immigrant group does the most crime or adapts the best, because there are big big differences. Indonesians in the Netherlands adapted pretty well even while being treated like shit by the goverment, while Moccocans do not. I remember an article from the head of police in Amsterdam about immigrants from 2 African countries, one overal integrated perfectly and placed much value on education, while the group from the other country placed low values on education and had high crime rates. 

In my view this is the biggest reason why there or so many problems concerned with this topic. politicans can't discuss this without being called a racist, (which many people in this thread seem to do) thus every issue that comes up with this is immidiately ignored and sweet talked. And that is frikking wrong, because your not solving the frikking problem, your letting it grow.

A quick note on islam: Overal the new generation turks and morrocans only seem to be muslim when it suits them, like when dad is asking about it. 

And a quick note on genetics: breeding with other ''ethnicity's'' makes strong baby's, most of the time the strong traits are dominant while weak traits (which may be prevailent among that particular ethnicity so they get passed on) are recessive.

With regards to Islam, that can't be said, they actively suppress dissenting voices and they are more than willing to use violence to achieve their goals.

The NHL is a business and want to make money so they obviously don't advocate violence, however the riot was most likely planned whether they would win or lose.

Who is ""they""? I personally don't know any Muslims who advocate violence. I also believe that most Muslims and Imams don't advocate violence because the large majority aren't extremists and live normal lives and are normal people. Muslims, just like us, are individuals and they don't have a common goal as you seem to suggest.

My argument is that there are assholes everywhere in every group. That's why there is a minority of Muslims in western Europe who want Sharia become violent if it doesn't go their way. Here in Sweden we have Nazis who march through the city every year during the national day and they are escorted by the police for everybody's safety.

False. Again, you're being terribly selective with the known data. From the same page you linked:

&gt;If ethnic diversity, at least in the short run, is a liability for social connectedness, a parallel line of emerging research suggests it can be a big asset when it comes to driving productivity and innovation. In high-skill workplace settings, says Scott Page, the University of Michigan political scientist, the different ways of thinking among people from different cultures can be a boon.  

&gt;""Because they see the world and think about the world differently than you, that's challenging,"" says Page, author of ""The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies."" ""But by hanging out with people different than you, you're likely to get more insights. Diverse teams tend to be more productive.""

There's your data that says otherwise. Diversity is not universally ""bad for society"" as you so claim; that is a poor reading. Perhaps a racist one, since you refuse to look at other data that *doesn't* justify your prejudices. It is as important to acknowledge its benefits as well as its drawbacks.

What OP is complaining about are the relatively recent ""[insert angry sarcastic comment about multiculturalism]"" type posts, that could just originate from a few dedicated people, or perhaps from some forum or other subreddit that has just 'discovered' /r/europe. 

Your observation about Finland seems either like a harsh generalisation, or then you've had bad luck with your acquaintances (the third option is that you're using 'racist' very liberally). I do agree that the comment sections of the tabloid newspapers tend to be filled with angry rants whenever immigrants and crime are somehow linked, but there I'd attribute it to the fringe elements being the noisiest. *An empty barrel makes the most noise* and all that. To an extent I think it's true now with this subreddit as well. 

To return to my earlier point: being self-critical is of course the proper Finnish way, but it's easy to overdo it. From my cultural perspective (Southern Finnish, middle class) Finland as a whole is one of the most tolerant places on earth. You'll find conservatives and liberals in every country, but if you look at the centre of political gravity we're hardly unfriendly to strangers.
