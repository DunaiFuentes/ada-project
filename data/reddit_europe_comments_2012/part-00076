I'd say most immigrants came for economic reasons. Not in the modern sense of better salaries, but for truly existencial reasons like food. The lower classes in Europe were in a really tight spot at the time settlement began. The forests belonged to the nobility, and hunting game was off-limits for them. Their main source of protein, AFAIK, was fish, and population growth had reached a point where there simply weren't enough of those in the rivers. When they came to America, they were allowed to hunt and there were plenty of fish in the rivers. There was enough arable land for everybody. For them, it truly was the Land of Plenty. You wouldn't want to live in a densely populated city like London in the 16th or 17th century as a commoner. Sewerage systems only came much later.

I'm not sure how democracy can agree with anything because it's a way of governance, but anyway if you poll an european country you will find at least 30 to 60% of people that are wary of more european integration or of the actual institutions. Those people have next to no representation in the european institutitions.

You can't dissociate a political regime from his elite as you are trying to do. It is important to understand what are some common thoughts and goals they share. If only in this case to get the disconnect between Brussels and the people.

Another example : if you polled about the death penalty, in a lot of countries you would find quite a few people to be in favor of the death penalty. And yet nearly 0% of the people in power are in favor of the death penalty in Europe (in public or in private). Why is that ? It is because of their education (they're enlightened enough to understand why we came to this conclusion in Europe), it is because the party that will push them to power is against the death penalty, because the institutions he wants to preside over do not allow the death penalty (by law).",0,1340230136,null,0,false,0,c53avpe,t3_vbrkg,t1_c53avpe,t1_c53agry,null,1429190086,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Don't mention it at all. Write all the others: English, Maltese and whatever else, BUT NOT French. It will be implied that you speak French from the fact that your CV is in French.

true,feros2,null,null,"im talking about the forced immigration that happened in ottoman ruled balkans. http://www.turkishcoalitionofamerica.com/media/Forced_Displacement.pdf
 After the fall of byzan and the balkans for 350 years constant immigrations were forced by the ottomans through all the balkans. Before that macedonia were belonging to byzantine, the language and people mentioned there is greek and latin. in rosseta stone there are 3 languages egyptian hieroglyph, greek and demotic script. im sry but there is no ancient macedonian language. All im trying to say is that the people that were leaving in ottoman ruled macedonia were originated and forced immigrated from bulgaria(explaning all of the similarities) and self declared ethnic bulgarians and secondly macedonians. The bulgarians were calling the people living in that area bulgar macedons.  Gotse Delchev was for example imbued with the ideas of Bulgarian liberation struggle and was sent in the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki. What im trying to say that the people living in ottoman ruled macedonia were first self declered as bulgarians but still calling themselves macedonians living at that region.Whoever says I am﻿ not Macedonian - I'll cut off his tongue; whoever says I am not Bulgarian - I'll cut off his head"" Todor Alexandrov. ''we will always work for the unification of bulgariandom'' Damian GRUEV. Few of them like pulevski wanted to dinstict themselves golce pulevsi publiced for the first time a dictationary of your language that was based on the bulgarian one ( and ofc cyrillic) and naming it macedonian. but you have do understand before all these macedonia was hellenic and the people living there were of greek origin. Greece just claimed the land that had since the byzantine empire. Also slavic tribes came at 6 th century 200 years after the form of byzantine. Plus about the barbarians, the Athenians were considering everyone except themselves barbarians(bitches right?). The macedonians were not allowed at first (they were later) bcz macedonia was not a democratic kingdom like the rest of greece. Even spartans had a democracy a military based one close to oligarchy but still democracy. All of them as they had the same language, gods and traditions formed a greater kingdom (after the roman dynasty) the grecum imperium as the romans were calling it byzantine empire as greeks were calling or roman eastern empire by both before christianity starts. Just my opinion sry for my first comment it was rude.

When voting on it as a single issue people are very negative on the issue.

They can't vote on it as a single issue in general election because there are always going to be several issues they will need to consider.

It's extremely dishonest to say if they want it they'll get it, because that has been exactly the opposite case, even with other countries that have had referendums.  They were promised a referendum by all parties because they wanted it and it was so popular.  Didn't happen though.  People didn't want the European Constitution either but it was virtually copied page for page and recalled the Lisbon Treaty, then forced on them; the one omission of note was a matter of federalism and statehood, and now that's rearing its head again.

&gt;kind of silly too because they can't really do anything there except moan in EU parliament.

Yet running on a single issue has thrown a spanner in the works.  By showing the EU that they are the second most popular party, behind a party that itself is heavily sceptical in the main, which of itself has helped create what we will see in the wake of federalisation - a two tier Europe and the UK more out than in.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"First off, there's no way I would model a federal European state after the United States. Given Europe's penchant for parliamentary government, it would be strange. Second, there's the problem of whether or not the executive should be a president or a prime minister. Having a president means he can be directly elected by the European people, which would help create a stronger European identity. A prime minister is a more natural fit for Europe because of its strong identification with parliamentary government, but prime ministers aren't directly elected.

As an American, I think I should also clear a few things up.

The are really only two main problems with the American system of government. These two problems, however, create the vast majority of problems with the US today.

The first problem is that we have a two party system that came about largely because of the way institutions were structured (the House and the Senate more so) and the electoral system of first-past-the-post. As such, the two-party system became institutionalized, and has become a mainstay of American political culture. Even if we were to fix the institutional problems, it would take a generation or two for our political culture to adapt to the existence of multiple parties. I wouldn't worry about this issue for a federal Europe, given that nearly every country in the EU has a multi-party system.

The second problem is that our upper house is extremely powerful. The Bundesrat is among the most powerful upper houses in Europe, and even it is weak relative to our Senate. Each individual Senator wields tremendous power both because of their actual position and because of their high profile/reputation. As a Californian, the Senate has always bothered me. I've never liked the fact that the Senator from Wyoming, a state with 400,000 people, has an equal vote as the Senator from California, a state with 38 million people. The Bundesrat distributes seats more proportionally, with the largest states getting 6 seats, and the smallest 3. This is a better model for Europe. European institutions have and do use weighted voting in many cases too. The prospect of an upper house as powerful as the American Senate is not very likely, but it is something to consciously avoid.

TL;DR - Biggest problems with the US are a two-party system and a very powerful Senate. Many other aspects of American government are worth emulating.",0,1340244405,null,0,false,0,c53e1rp,t3_vbrkg,t1_c53e1rp,t3_vbrkg,null,1429191596,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

In my case, I believe that European culture is worth preserving. I believe, therefore, that immigration should be toned down. I don't believe we should stone immigrants, though.

I also think it's wrong to try to resist human nature. The classic gender roles developed because of natural differences in the genders. That doesn't mean women should be abused and put down. But we shouldn't try to make every job have a 50-50 gender distribution.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;In the US, the federal level is much too dominant. This is already a problem in the US (marijuana dispensaries / state commerce etc)

Probably that's one reason why EU officials favor the US as a model: our model causes power to gradually concentrate in the federal government.

The states originally had complete control over health, public safety, education, and public morality regulations.  The federal government has infringed on those areas by expanding the definition of ""commerce"" in the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution, which allows Congress to regulate commerce between the states.

In a series of cases, the Supreme Court expanded the definition of ""interstate commerce,"" which the Constitution says Congress can regulate, until it included even non-participation in commerce (reasoning: abstaining from a market affects the pricing of that market's commodities; thus, non-participation in commerce is commerce).  By that and similar precedents, Congress was able to do some good things, like de-segregate the South, and some arguably bad things, like make it illegal for a person to grow marijuana in his own home for personal use (under the non-commerce = commerce precedent).

If Europe copied our system, it could avoid the Commerce Clause loophole, which is a feature of our federal system that was not originally intended.

&gt; What I have a problem with is that you don't want a federation what you want is a confederation where based on the historic coincidence that you guys just happen to be richer when it formed you hold all the power.

It would be intended as a temporary arrangement. And it makes sense. Lord knows that in 1550 or so if Portugal and Finland had ended up in an union of some sort, I would have expected Portugal to rule the hell out of it... until hopefully Finland would have caught up.

I don't want protectorates, but I do feel that right now the North has more to teach to the South, and if we assume your debts via euro bonds, there's a very real chance that we just gave your governments the worst lesson ever: there are no real consequences to their actions.

As long as someone like Berlusconi can not only have a political career, but a very successful one... well, little scary.

I suggested elsewhere that we leave Corporate Tax for the EU, which will use it to take care of defense and infrastructure spending. That would give it an independent power base. Still wouldn't really be sufficient to figure out euro bonds (which really are risky due to the entitlement programs, which we most definitely don't want run on a federal level).

I argued that this should not be discussed here because Turkey is not a European nation. 

Despite the fact that Turkey still has some land west of the Bosporus I do no not consider the Turks to be Europeans because historically they have been nothing but an enemy of European nations. They have a different religion and share in very little of the ideals of Enlightenment. All the legislative changes the Turks have made in recent years to better civil rights have only been made to join the EU, that was their reason. Not because it was better for a democracy but because they want some of that sweet sweet EU market, it gives me an impression of Turkey as a wolf in sheep's clothes more than anything.

To see this sort of posts gives me the willies because to me they signify a kind of appeasing mentality where the Turks are welcomed into the EU because they can temporarily provide cheap labor while at the same time ignoring that this is exactly the moment when European integration might start to happen properly. To start making room for the Turks to join now would be to invite cultural and democratic unrest in the EU for far longer than a decade or two of cheap labor would be worth.

I really, really doubt Spanish GDP/cap was anywhere near Germany around 2000, so lets not exaggerate the situation back then. Yes, Germany had problems, but it has been a powerful a sound nation ever since Bismarck (and arguably ever since the 2nd millenia came about, though it was often politically very fragmented). You have a much better case with Finland, which didn't amount to much until pretty much WW2, and we lost even that one. 19th century Finland could have probably lived with having some things dictated to it by Portugal, or alternatively I would have understood Portugal waiting for us to get our stuff in order before accepting responsibility for our spending.

&gt;  Is it simply a prejudiced default North rules South thing?

No. It's a law and order situation mixed with GDP/capita thing. I mean I just read a very compelling article about ""mafia states"" where organized crime and government are very tightly coupled. Surely you have to sympathize with a concern over such countries just walking in as democracies?

There is a large Karl May festival each year with reenactments of fictional events, which is a big tourist attraction. There also are groups of certain people who apparently enjoy spending weekends on Western themed elaborate adult playgrounds. But if you catch a report about them on TV, it's from that same outside ""those people are very strange"" perspective that you would have as well. 

AFAIK he was really popular in the GDR, but I haven't lived there back then. In West Germany, movies based on his stories were produced in the 60's, and I think they were pretty big, they had repeats on TV even decades later. 

From what I know, his books were tremendously successful for long after his death. My parents are in their early 60s and they still have read them in their youth. Nowadays, not so much. We're talking about 19th century adventure pop fiction here, after all, and that's not something kids typically pick up on their own.  

I don't know of anything you could compare it to in the US. I'd hate to compare him to Mark Twain, because that's literature on a different level of quality, he knew the culture he wrote about and that he observed it so well is a large part of the attraction, and his humor is timeless. There are similar problems with Jules Verne, who would be another example of a highly successful adventure book author of that time period who remains relevant, and there is the parallel that his stories are set in a made-up world. But again, that's just another level of quality. They were, and still are, read for that quality, whereas Karl May became successful because he catered to his readers' longing for that New World. You have to consider the attraction that the romantic phantasy to give up your live at home and start a new one half way around the world must have had. What they have in common, though, is that those were books that parents had read in their youth and could hand down to their own kids.

The important thing to understand that in the European lingo right = nationalist.

So of course, if you are very very nationalist, then you are also anti-individualust and socialist, because you think your countrymen should stick together, support each other. You cannot be a nationalist and an individualist the same time: if you believe the nation is sacred and the nation comes before the individual, you cannot support free-market policies, the whole thing will just be too asocial and individualist for you. While if you are not so nationalist, you are more OK with letting people fend for themselves on the free market.

Hence the far right, the very nationalist, is also often quite socialist, while the center-right is more capitalist, because not so nationalist, hence more individualist.

Does it make sense? 

A good American parallel for the European far right is Ross Perot and Lyndon LaRouche. AFAIK they were quite socialist. You could also call it populism.

In Japan - if you asked them for a way they are going to tell you the wrong way, even they know it (because otherwise they feel embarrassed).
In Germany - we will tell you the truth and get you the information you need. 

So the point is, do not think in a negative way of Germans speaking English - they only want to help you so you do not get anything wrong. 

It is a German habit, same as all over the world they say ""Germans are really hard and good workers"" - Whatever you get my idea.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"I was referring to the Tea Party, which is a post-Bush movement in the US, and the one which defines the current House Republican majority, which has been the dominant right-wing force in the US since 2010 but which hopefully will not be a majority after this year's elections.  The Tea Party entered our politics around 2008 and is the group that is responsible for the GOP's alarming shift to the right since Obama took office.

""Neocon"" now only refers to a type of foreign policy in which the US uses its military for both its gain and the invaded party's gain, or so the theory goes.  They tend to be moderate domestically, but it is their foreign policy that defines them.  A Republican who favors certain welfare programs is simply a Republican from a more moderate district - it takes a specific type of foreign policy to make a Neocon.  The Neocons are not influential in the current Republican Party - they have been largely discredited by the Iraq War.  The current GOP is militaristic, but the Tea Party doesn't favor nation building and foreign aid, as the Neocons do.

Bush himself, however, was a representative of what Americans call ""the Republican establishment.""  There were Neocons in his administration, but he was not known as a Neocon prior to his presidency.  Mitt Romney also represents this group.  They are a typical group of party bigwigs and rich donors who are not as far right as the Tea Party and don't want to change the status quo.  They want lower taxes and pro-business policies; the main reason they pander to Christian conservatives is for votes.  They support moderate welfare programs and are willing to compromise with Democrats, so that is why these ""establishment Republicans,"" like the Bush dynasty, will enact moderate welfare programs.  The Tea Partiers hate it and view it as another sign that the Establishment is too liberal or too ""elitist.""

Then of course there are the Christian conservatives.  I'm sure you can imagine them.  They now overlap with the Tea Party.

Nationalists complain about the EU robbing the country of its sovereignty, while Socialists complain that the trade barriers are detrimental to the developing countries and thus unsolidaristic.

The pro-EU opinion seems to boil down to the basic idea of the EU acting as a stabilizing force that through commerce and political harmonization creates stability and prevents wars by making all member states interdependent.

Onestamente, se la potica e la situazione lavorativa migliorassero io mi fionderei indietro. Pensatela come volete ma le bellezze naturalistiche e soprattutto artistiche e l'atmosfera che c'e' nei paesetti sono uniche al mondo!!!

Inoltre guardo programmi in italiano perche voglio che mio figlio impari la lingua originaria di suo padre e quella che parlano i suoi nonni!

E non nego che ogni tanto, di fronte a un programma di viaggi che mostri le bellezze nascoste nei piccoli paesi di provincia, una lacrimuccia mi scenda, e mi incazzo come una vipera pensando che per colpa di alcuni politici corrotti, per avere la vita che voglio, debba stare dall'altra parte dell'oceano.

Perchè per ogni scorcio di paesaggio agrestre coi bambini e i cerbiatti ce ne sono cinque di perfierie degradate coi tossici e i vecchi lasciati a marcire. Perchè dire ""EH LITALIA CIA PROBLEMI PERO CAZZO I PAESEINI, IL MARE, LENTROTERRA"" è fare gli struzzi che vogliono vedere solo quello che vogliono dando la colpa ai politici.

però in italia i politic ce li meritiamo; perchè potremmo protestare, lanciare i sassi, el macchine, bruciare il parlamento, manifestare, e invece stiamo in casa a guardare i pacchi perchè IL MARE, LA CUCINA I VERI VALORI ITALIANI MADE IN ITALI'.

e allora ben venga che chi se ne esce taglia i ponti con questo buco infernale pieno di paradossi e di ontrasti insensati forzati dal popolo stesso con la scusa di non poter far niente contro una politica opprimenre. E vaffanculo anche alla politica che opprime davvero, che se vuoi fare qualcosa non puoi se non conosci la persona giusta, e se la conosci la devi pagare fior di quattrini per fargli fare un lavoro che è il suo. E allora che brucino le foreste e si asciughino i cazzo di mari, io non voglio vivere in una cartolina, voglio vivere in un paese che si vergogna di mandfare in onda don matteo e i pacchi e veline e striscia la notizia e il mercante in fiera e chissà quali e queante altre minchiate, voglio un paese che dice ""con la crisi non ci sono i soldi per pagare gli stipendi, figuriamoci per mandare 11 pirla a prendere a calci un pallone"", un paese il cui popolo non si nasconde più sotto un secchiello o dietro un dito dando ad altri la colpa della propria sclerosi socio-culturale. 

la sai qual'èl'atmosfera dei paesetti unici al mondo? è quella di tutti i paesetti di campagna. Le vecchie giudicano le giovani, i vecchi spingono i giovani dove credono che sia meglio spingerli, faide interfamilioari più o meno serie vanno avanti da generazioni - a Genova come a Reggio calabria; ma come a Fuckfolck, Scozia o a Cazzinculomaru, Hokkaido. 

basta con sto mito della madre patria che è bella nonostante tutto: l'italia è un bel pezzo di geografia infestato da un morbo debilitante, ignorante, grezzo, incompetente ed immeritevole che si chiama, ahimè, Italiani. Che non è diverso da qualsiasi altro scorcio di umanità che si trovi altrove, forse però gode dell'accentuazione di determinate caratteristiche negative, quali ad esempio la cultura del tirare a vivere, dell'inghippo, del concertare, del combinare, dell'arrangiarsi.

[European Salon de News - 21 June](http://www.eurotrib.com/story/2012/6/20/123848/312)

* [Anatole Kaletsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatole_Kaletsky) says Germany is once again the enemy

&gt; ""Merkel doubtless believes that she is helping Europe when she maternally instructs the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards to 'do their homework' and so become good little Germans. But like its less benign predecessors, this effort to impose German hegemony is guaranteed to fail. Europe's leaders must therefore start considering a previously unmentionable question, perhaps as soon as next week's summit, if the euro crisis intensifies. This question is not whether Europe will agree to live under German leadership, but whether Germany will agree to live under EU leadership - or whether the other nations must form a united front against Germany to prevent the destruction of Europe, as they have repeatedly in the past...""


* [Ewald Nowotny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewald_Nowotny) warns of excessive austerity by drawing parallels with the rise of Nazism

&gt; He uses historic parallels to the rise of Nazism in Germany to warn of the potential consequences of excessive austerity in the euro crisis countries, Süddeutsche Zeitung reports. According to the paper, the Austrian central bank governor said at a conference on Monday night that the tough consolidation measures of the late 1920s produced mass unemployment in Germany which in turn led to the collapse of democracy and the takeover of power by the Nazis. While Niall Ferguson and Nouriel Roubini had made the same argument in an oped recently, this is the first time that a member of the ECB governing council makes this case. The paper says this is particularly awkward since the ECB is part of the troika that negotiates and controls the austerity measures and their implementation in the program countries.",0,1340282779,null,0,1340283159,0,c53k38v,t3_vdne1,t1_c53k38v,t3_vdne1,null,1429194588,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

If by this you mean someone who did nothing to stop the Nazis then I would be inclined to agree with you. This is an example of one of the few circumstances where I would consider killing other human beings a necessity. To quote Christy Moore:

When they fetched the people who were members of trades unions,

Round they took the homosexuals,
Then they gathered up the students and the gypsies,

Has it ever come across your mind that, if any fragment of what you (and your people) are saying has any merit, how is it that the stubborn people living in Macedonia are STILL after ALL THIS TIME referring themselves as Macedonian?

(Wobei ich nur Zusammenfassung und Abschluss selbst gelesen habe, den Rest nur überflogen, in diesem Rest stecken z.B. auch Korrelation von ""Patriotismus"" und Fremdenfeindlichkeit, der Artikel ist also nicht etwa vollkommen falsch) Ein paar Zitate:

&gt;Differenzierungen des Patriotismuskonzepts zeigen, dass
es qualitativ unterschiedliche Formen von Patriotismus gibt, die in spezifischer Weise mit teilweise gegensätzlichen
Variablen verbunden sind. Z. B. hängt konstruktiver Patriotismus mit Engagement gegen Fremdenfeindlichkeit
zusammen, blinder Patriotismus dagegen umgekehrt mit Fremdenfeindlichkeit. Es wird
unter Bezugnahme auf die Selbstkategorisierungstheorie (Turner et al., 1987) gefolgert, dass Patriotismus
nicht gut oder schlecht an sich ist, sondern seine Auswirkungen von den Werten und Normen abhängen, in
denen die nationale Identität verankert gesehen wird.

und:

&gt;Die Auswirkungen von Patriotismus sind also variabel.
Patriotismus kann mit demokratisch erwünschten
Aspekten (z. B. Engagement gegen
Fremdenfeindlichkeit, demokratisches Engagement
im Allgemeinen), aber auch mit demokratisch
unerwünschten Aspekten (z. B. Ausländerfeindlichkeit,
Nationalismus und Kritiklosigkeit)
einhergehen. Entscheidend ist vor allem, welche
inhaltlichen Werte mit der nationalen Identität verbunden
sind bzw. wie das nationale Selbstverständnis
aussieht und wie stark die Bereitschaft zu
politischer Involviertheit ausgeprägt ist.

und:

&gt;Soll man nun Patriotismus fördern oder kritisieren?
Diese Frage macht nach den Ausführungen in
diesem Beitrag wenig Sinn. Patriotismus im Sinne
einer Verbundenheit und positiven Identifikation
mit dem Land ist weder schädlich noch wünschenswert
an sich. Er kann erwünschte ebenso
wie unerwünschte Effekte haben.

sowie:

&gt;Zu bedenken ist abschließend,
dass Patriotismus sich nicht unbedingt auf die Nation
beziehen muss. Ist neben Lokal- oder Regionalpatriotismus
und nationsbezogenem Patriotismus
vielleicht auch Patriotismus auf europäischer
Ebene oder gar globaler Patriotismus möglich?
Dies wäre eine Art Identifikation mit der ganzen
Menschheit, von der positive Auswirkungen, etwa
hinsichtlich Einstellungen zu Zuwanderern und
Minderheiten oder Engagementbereitschaft für
die Menschenrechte, anzunehmen sind (Luke &amp;

Stimmt, es geht viel mehr um sportlichen Wettkampf und identifizierung mit der Mannschaft, als Identifizierung mit der Nation, zumindest sehe ich die Sache so. Es ist für die meisten in dieser Zeit ein Symbol für die Mannschaft und nicht für das ""Vaterland"". 

&gt; * Und selbst wenn: Patriotismus ist nicht = Nationalismus.

Diese Unterscheidung ist etwas schwieriger als du es scheinen lässt. Siehe [diesen Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/vdijg/was_haltet_ihr_vom_fahnenschwenken_und_schwarz/c53j956) und am besten auch meine Antwort. Praktischer lässt sich sagen: Selbstidentifizierung mit einem Wertesystem und einer Gruppe ist nicht immer schlecht, die Werte des Nationalismus/""Patriotismus"" sind aber nicht unbedingt die zu bevorzugenden (MMn./IMO natürlich).

&gt; * Die logische Konsequenz eines bijährlichen Fahnenschwenkens ist nicht, dass wir morgen in Polen einmarschieren.

Es geht weniger darum, dass Fähnchenschwenken uns ins vierte Reich führt, sondern das ich und viele Andere auch mit Sorge betrachten wenn ""Patriotismus"" Mode wird. Ein Kulturwert verbreitet und festigt sich langsam, und hauptsächlich durch Nachahmung und Adaption in kleinen Gruppen z.B. Freundeskreisen. Es ist schlicht so, dass ich lieber in einer Welt der internationalen Weltbürger leben möchte, als in einer der Nationalstaaten.

Damit - behaupte ich zumindest - geht es auch weniger um die Angst Deutschlands vor sich selbst. Es ist schlicht so, dass ich eine Identifizierung mit Nationalideen sehr viel weniger schätze als etwa eine humanistische Internationalität, weshalb ich den ganzen Nationalkitsch und die damit verbundene Verbreitung des ""Patriotismus/Nationalismus""-Mems nicht sonderlich mag.

And we reassure our opponents that no future democratic movement will be able to sustain a campaign as long as needed. We lose. Europe loses.

Dear Miss Beata. I am grateful for your loving and informing letter from 04-13. 
Unfortunately, it is filled with worries about the medical condition of your father.  (Kasimier?)
Hopefully he does not have to suffer a lot from such a vicious disease. But that’s how life works – Youth is a wonderful time – but there is also increasing weakness and suffering in older ages. But only few people have the good fortune to reach such a biblical age. Leon is probably even older. How is he doing? Please send also greetings to your mother and if possible to your father. Please inform me about how you all are doing. I often think gladly about the visit in Wyminstowo, how warm-hearted you all were. Even in the bad years of the war the relationship to your family was very well in Mühlhagen. My father helped wherever he could, despite he wasn´t allowed to do it at all and had bad troubles with the Nazi party. Also the three Serb prisoners of war were treated well at our place. For us, the end of war also meant the end of our existence. The expropriation by the Russians in association with the Communist Party came really hard to our family. Undeserved i would say, but not even good people are immune from misfortune. But there came better times for us too, we had jobs and wages and housing and of course a loving wife and two daughters.",0,1340306523,null,0,1340308821,0,c53pzzb,t3_vdqsw,t1_c53pzzb,t3_vdqsw,null,1429197455,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

In a word 'yes'.  It's that much of a deal breaker.

If I were to throw my chips on the roulette table, so to speak, I don't think we'll see Scotland voting for independence either way, and I don't really see the Scotland issue having much sway either way on the European decision until after the event.  By that I mean that if Scotland does choose independence, which I'm not for but nor am I a naysayer of doom in that it would be catastrophic for either (although I'm of the mind the remaining UK, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, would fair overall better than Scotland on the short to mid-term), then the remaining UK leaving the EU would become much more likely - although I still maintain that renegotiating terms and staying in, but to a lesser degree, is more likely.

It's a simple fact that the UK always wanted the common market and the 4 freedoms and have put up begrudgingly with the rest as a necessary by-product.  The longer the EU project goes on it seems like it's moving further and further away from that.  It's not like the UK doesn't want to be friends or has any real animosity, or that it doesn't want to trade, even still be a net contributor.  They'd still pay far more than what Norway does to be a member of the EEA.  They'd still provide bailout money through the IMF, they'd have still backed Irish banks to encourage stability when they had a crisis.  They'd still be part of the common European defence policy.

UKIP doesn't support going down the EEA path.  They endorse negotiating a trade agreement and walking away altogether.  EU regulations included.

&gt;or Switzerland's EFTA model is just plain wrong.

I think it is plainly right, for all to see, that Switzerland, as a non-EU member, has fewer EU obligations.

&gt;There are directives which they don't have to opt in,but esentially it's all the same EU laws and regulations these countries need to comfort to,in order to remain part of the single market. 

Switzerland as part of EFTA isn't part of the internal market but instead negotiated bilateral agreements.  Clearly is a Swiss factory wants to sell to Europe that factory's product must meet EU regulations, same goes if the decide to sell to Russia, America or China, with regards to Russian, American or Chinese regulations.  No difference.

&gt;It's pretty pointless to pull out,if we have to comfort to essentially all laws EU countries have to abide by,but not have any say-whatsoever in how they are decided or whether they are implemented. 

If they're passed then there's no say anyway.  Vote against and they still apply - add to that the UK weight of voting means after November 2014 the UK vote carries less weight anyway, and the EU economies as a whole don't represent UK needs.  The UK economy, it's primary sectors, services and finance, aren't primarily represented.

In return the UK gets to ditch CAP (although still provide more subsidy to UK farmers but for less), CFP, gain a seat on the WTO (the next head of which is set to be British), lower its net contribution, and have greater autonomy to negotiate trade with its links in the Commonwealth and the other states that have world leading finance sectors...and still maintain its trade with the EU.

It has access to a 15 trillion $ market with a 500 million large consumer base. All of the EEA countries have benefited from being part of the single market, even the UK, many jobs in your country are directly linked to trade between the UK and EU member countries. In fact, more than 50% of the exports and imports in the UK are with EU partners.

Europeans keep using this argument and everyone with any knowledge of the EU can see that it's bullshit.

While the EEA does give Britain free trade with a large market it also denies Britain free trade with larger markets.

&gt;more than 50% of the exports and imports in the UK are with EU partners.

Naturally that would happen when you consider how much the EEA incentives European trade at the expense of external trade.


&gt;If the UK chooses to exit the EU and maybe join the EEA in hopes to maintain itself a part of the single market, it will still have to adopt and maintain all EU laws regarding the single market, but you will lose any say in the law making process.

Nonsense, there is always the possibility of creating a Anglo-European trade agreement.

&gt;Steal British money? That's an asinine statement.

Britain is being forced to financially support other countries, including third world countries like Romania. Nobody wants to be paying for Europe while it gives us no benefit. This is equal to theft.

Even then I wouldn't want to be part of it. There is no reason why foreigners should be able to decide British law. Not only do they have different values but many can't even speak English.

&gt;but the UK still maintains it's sovereignty, like all EU member nations do. Policy making at the EU level is a very democratic process, all member countries are involved.

true,makedonian,MACE,Macedonia,"Somebody obviously has a 'fucking problem' and it's not me. What's most hilarious about you my friend is that you are still trying to convince me (on multiple levels even) that I am not who I think I am. Tell me, do you even know why you are doing this? I am trying to understand what's your motivation here. Knowing your background would help me, but let me go on limb. If you are a Greek (which I assume you are), you're claiming that I am a Bulgarian basically. Your Ottoman forced migrations removed EVERYONE from the territory of Macedonia (assuming that there were people who were obviously not Bulgarians living there before right?), and settled it with Bulgarians. So the slate is clean, and this is where the ancient Macedonians ceased to exist according to you. I'm not even going to ask where were those people sent, but focus on the newly migrated Bulgarians. Since it looks like you read some bit of Bulgarian history, you know they are a very proud people with a long history of their own. Wouldn't you think that these Bulgarians who were forcefully migrated to Macedonia according to you, would not want to stay Bulgarians? What/who brainwashed them to into believing that now they are decedents of the ancient Macedonians? Why have they been fighting for freedom of Bulgarian rule if they were Bulgarians to begin with?

I have yet to see the day when a greek declares himself a macedonian. Greeks have always hated macedonians, it's so well documented by greek writers from old ages. I am not denying the similarities in language, of course, but it is certain that there was a distinct macedonian language (or even a dialect) that Greeks did not speak. If you go far enough in time, we are all related. If we spoke Turkish today because of 5 centuries of Ottoman rule, would that make you a Turk? Does it make you a Turk that you enjoy baklava? They've had tremendous influence on culture and  customs on the balkans but that does not change the history of the people living there. You are most definitely not a an ethnic greek. But you are still a greek and nothing will change that. Same with me. But my ancestors have lived here forever and they have never proclaimed themselves anything else except Macedonian. People living in Aegean Macedonia have always proclaimed themselves Macedonian. Because they were Macedonian. 
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/macedonia_1849.jpg
See how in this map there is a clear distinction between greece and macedonia? Modern Greece has only annexed that part in the last century. Do you know why Macedonian was immediately outlawed in this newly acquired land? Do you know why there were migrations to this part of Greece? Because the people living there WERE NOT GREEK. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11260506?dopt=Abstract
&gt;The following conclusions have been reached: 1) Macedonians belong to the ""older"" Mediterranean substratum, like Iberians (including Basques), North Africans, Italians, French, Cretans, Jews, Lebanese, Turks (Anatolians), Armenians and Iranians, 2) Macedonians are not related with geographically close Greeks, who do not belong to the ""older"" Mediterranenan substratum, 3) Greeks are found to have a substantial relatedness to sub-Saharan (Ethiopian) people, which separate them from other Mediterranean groups. Both Greeks and Ethiopians share quasi-specific DRB1 alleles, such as *0305, *0307, *0411, *0413, *0416, *0417, *0420, *1110, *1112, *1304 and *1310. Genetic distances are closer between Greeks and Ethiopian/sub-Saharan groups than to any other Mediterranean group and finally Greeks cluster with Ethiopians/sub-Saharans in both neighbour joining dendrograms and correspondence analyses. The time period when these relationships might have occurred was ancient but uncertain and might be related to the displacement of Egyptian-Ethiopian people living in pharaonic Egypt.

And lastly, you are somewhat right about Greece plotting to destroy us. You don't see us buying up full pages in the New York Times crying to George Bush about why they are recognizing our name. You don't see us vetoing our entry to the EU. You don't see us bitching at every single goddamned political forum about somebody using our name. Cause this is all what this is about. This is not about what people we are or whatever. It's about the name. If we put aside the issue of our origin for a second (fuck it, lets say that we are of greek origin, bulgarian origin, serb origin, fucking african origin, you name it), we've lived on this land and called this land Macedonia forever. You only got hold of Aegean Macedonia hundred years ago! What gives you the exclusive right of the name Macedonia again?

Maybe you are special. Or are you guys still mad about Alexander and all that conquering of Greece thing... Cause if I were you, AND I was so mental and bitter about it, I would probably try to rewrite history too.

But I am not. I don't give a shit about it. I don't care about the past, there's nothing I can do about it. History so old is just unreliable. Most conclusions are based on assumptions since there is no much evidence from back then. What I do care about is how my people are treated today by people like you.

If I offered you an olive branch right now, and said listen, how about we agree that we can share this history together. Lets say that my people are half ancient macedonian and half (pick your poison here, slavs, bulgarians, serbs, ottomans...) and your people living in Aegean Macedonian are half ancient macedonian and half greek.

While the EEA does give Britain free trade with a large market it also denies Britain free trade with larger markets.              
                            
                     
How is that argument 'bullshit'?        
These are the countries the EU has free trade agreements with (and lots of pending and negotiating deals are underway!): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_free_trade_agreements          
Also with the US we have a special trade relationship:       
http://ec.europa.eu/trade/creating-opportunities/bilateral-relations/countries/united-states/                  
Same with China:       
http://ec.europa.eu/trade/creating-opportunities/bilateral-relations/countries/china/          
                    
                   
&gt;Naturally that would happen when you consider how much the EEA incentives European trade at the expense of external trade.              
                    
             
Of course that would happen, even without EEA incentives, due to the UK's geographical position.                   
                             
                    

          
&gt;Nonsense, there is always the possibility of creating a Anglo-European trade agreement.                  
                    
Sure, the UK can negotiate a separate trade agreement, but it will be nowhere near have the benefits of being in the EEA or the EU. You would still need to abide by a lot of the EU rules.                     
                              
                            
                
&gt;Britain is being forced to financially support other countries, including third world countries like Romania. Nobody wants to be paying for Europe while it gives us no benefit. This is equal to theft.                    
                        
                                   
Romania isn't third world, look up the definition instead of throwing out remarks which you think might insult my home country. I think the world you're looking for is 'developing nation'.                    
**All** of the EU countries contribute to the EU, the UK has been historically the second largest contributor, but in recent times France has contributed more. There are many other countries with higher contributions per capita than the UK. Nobody is stealing that money from you, it's money used so that all of the member nations, including the UK, continue to enjoy the benefits of the Union.                          
                              
                     
&gt;Even then I wouldn't want to be part of it. There is no reason why foreigners should be able to decide British law. Not only do they have different values but many can't even speak English.              
                               
The UK has a say the law making process, all EU nations do, that's why the EU is a democratic union.              
And what does speaking English have to do with it?                
                
                 
             
&gt;No it isn't democratic. The European Commission are answerable to no one.
                
               
Do you know what the European Commission is? It operates akin to a cabinet government and it has 27 members. The current High Representative of the Commission is from the UK.            
The Commission President is proposed by the EU Council (comprised of the heads of state of the EU member nations) and elected by the EU Parliament (MEPs are voted by the population). The Council (aka the heads of state of the EU member nations) appoint the other 26 Commission members.            
The EU Commission is subject to an approval vote by the EU Parliament, meaning they are answerable to the EU Parliament, and indirectly to the EU Council.            
                           
               
 
&gt;They're all done through the EU, Britain does not control its own trade.              
              
             
What? Please read this so you can understand how international trade works:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade              

             
             
       
&gt;The UK would be much better off outside of the EU with the right agreement and you know it.              
                    
                      
I am an International Relations student and I can honestly say that I do not envision the UK doing better outside the EU.

Btw., perpetuating myths. Here are the figures at the end of 2009 (i.e., at the beginning of the crisis), in millions of US dollars:

**Spain**|1,273|15,664 |46,786|86,083|-|&amp;nbsp;|1,493,513

What's missing is what was owed to the banks of the affected countries themselves. The biggest holder of Greek debt, not surprisingly, were Greek banks.

The other Eurozone countries contribute proportionally to their GDP, so you need to look at those figures relative to the respective countries GDPs. I've added the value for 2011 in the column on the right. Not the same year, I know, not the same euro to dollar exchange rate, either. Doesn't matter, because the exchange rage is the same for all of them, and we're only doing a rough estimate anyway.

So, how much benefited those countries banks, relative to their countries GDP?

Let's make another table and do the math!

&amp;nbsp;|Per mille GDP|
:---|---:
**Austria**|11
**Belgium**|7
**France**|27
**Germany**|13
**Greece**|**!**
**Ireland**|39
**Italy**|3
**Netherlands**&amp;nbsp;|14
**Portugal**|41
**Spain**|1

Of course there are other ways to look at it that arguably would be valid as well, e.g., relative to the respective country's banking sector. I'm just using GDP here because that's what the share of the bailout fund is based on, and because the figures are easily available.  
But that's all nonsense anyway, because even though many of those banks could have absorbed the loss, and later even had to deal with losing most of it during the ""voluntary restructuring"", this wasn't a conspiracy to bail out any country's banks through the back door. As I said before, most of it was with Greek banks, so without the bailout they would have been *gone*, and most of Greece's economy with them, and then we would have had to deal with the same thing in various other countries, one after the other.

So, if that's OK with you, I'm going to downvote you now.

true,MaxManus,null,null,"Guten Tag. Mein Thema ist”Jugend im dritten Reich” Meine Text  stammt aus „Wir waren Hitlers Eliteschüler“
Dieser Absatz wurde von Hardy Krüger geschrieben. Hardy Krüger wurde 1928 geboren, und wurde später ein sehr berühmter Schauspieler. Im Jahr 1941 begann er am die Adolf-Hitler-Schule in der Ordensburg Sonthofen. Da war er nur dreizehn Jahre alt. Bis 1944, In der letzten Phase des Krieges wurde der sechzehnjährige Hardy bei der SS in gewältige Kämpfe verwickelt. Später kam er in amerikanische Kriegsgefangenschaft. Während seiner Zeit in der Ordensburg, wurde Hardy Krüger als Hauptdarsteller für einen Propaganda Film ausgewählt. Die Erzählung von Hardy Krüger fängt an mit der Auserwählung des Hauptdarstellers in dem NS-Film „Junge Adler“. Der Regisseur des Films Alfred Weidenmann, suchte fünf junge Darsteller. Hardy Krüger war ihm aufgefallen, da er ein guter Boxer war. Hardy Krüger beschreibt die Unterschiede zwischen der Napola und der NS-Eliteschulung. ***Bei der Napola musste er vom Zehnmeterbrett springen, hatte Hardy zehn Meter unter dem Eis Schwimmen, dafür fühlte die junge von der Adolf-Hitler-Schule überlegen.*** Wie ein Schüler auf der Adolf-Hitler-Schule musste man präpariert sein für sehr wichtige Aufgaben in der Zukunft. Zum Beispiel Gauleiter von Moskau zu werden. Der Zweck der Adolf-Hitler-Schule war es, für zukünftigen Plichten vorbereitet zu werden. Ebendeshalb war der Junge von der Adolf-Hitler-Schule in vielen verschiedenen Disziplinen unterrichtet. Diese Disziplinen erstreckten sich über Weltanschauung, Latein, Mathematik, Englisch, Biologie, Leichtathletik, Waffenkunde, Strategie und Fechten. Das ganze Pensum war natürlich höchst beeinflusst durch die nationalsozialistische Ideologie. Dem Adolf-Hitler-Schüler sollten alle Möglichkeiten offen stehen, und der Unterricht war locker. Ein krasser Gegensatz zu den restlichen deutschen Schulen, 

*** des Weiteren könnte die Schuler auf Der Ordensburg Sonthofen
Hardy war nicht glücklich (maybe you're looking for the word ""trotz"" (despite) here) bei alle dieser Vergünstigungen.***

 Im 1941 schreibt er an seine Eltern: „Glücklich bin ich hier nicht“ Er hatte keine Problem mit der Schleiferei (make sure you know what that means. It can either mena to sharpen a knife or scissor, or it is an old german term for a hard, military training), oder der Politik, aber er vermisste seine Familie. Manchmal fand Hardy die rauhen Sitten und Ideologie nicht leicht. Alles geschah, abgesehen von den Unterrichtsstunden im Kommandoton und Gleichschritt. Außerdem kamen die älteren Jahrgänge und prügelten die Jüngeren Schuler.
Segeln und Fliegen sind als Hobbys im späteren Leben geblieben. Durch die Adolf-Hitler-Schule ist Hardy Krüger Filmschauspieler geworden. Hardy Krügers Erinnerung ist vielleicht typisch für viele Deutsche. Am Anfang sympathisieren er mit Hitler und der Nazi-Partei, ganz so wie seine Eltern, aber später erkannte er wie Hitler wirklich war. Napola ist ein Spielfilm aus dem Jahre 2004. Er erzählt von der Freundschaft, welche zwei jungen während ihrer Ausbildung in einer Nationalpolitischen Erziehungsanstalt, oder einfach nur NAPOLA, hatten. Die zwei jungen hießen Friedrich Weimer und Albrecht Stein. Friedrich war wie Hardy eine gute Boxer, und kam dafür an eine Napola Schule, und ganz wie Hardy ist Friedrich prädestiniert  ein guter zukünftiger Nazi zu werden. Er musste auch zehn meter unter Eis schwimmen.
Wir haben eine Text über Adolf Hitlers Pädagogik gelesen. Und wie die Adolf-Hitler-Schule gekennzeichnet ist, es ist sachbezogen diese Ideologie oder Pädagogik zu untersuche.
Adolf Hitler sagte: „Von der Jugend hängt die Zukunft des deutschen Volkes ab. Die gesamte deutsche Jugend muss deshalb auf ihre künftigen Plichten vorbereitet werden. Meine Pädagogik ist hart.

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren. Ich bearbeite das Thema ”Jugend im dritten Reich”. Ich beziehe mich auf einen Text aus „Wir waren Hitlers Eliteschüler“
Der genaue Absatz wurde von Hardy Krüger geschrieben. Hardy Krüger wurde 1928 geboren und wurde später ein sehr berühmter Schauspieler. Im Jahr 1941 begann er an der Adolf-Hitler-Schule in der Ordensburg Sonthofen. Damals war er erst dreizehn Jahre alt. In der letzten Phase des Krieges wurde der sechzehnjährige Hardy 1955 bei der SS in gewältige Kämpfe verwickelt. Später kam er in amerikanische Kriegsgefangenschaft. Während seiner Zeit in der Ordensburg, wurde Hardy Krüger als Hauptdarsteller für einen Propaganda Film ausgewählt. Die Erzählung von Hardy Krüger fängt an mit seiner Wahl zum Hauptdarsteller im NS-Film „Junge Adler“. Der Regisseur des Films, Alfred Weidenmann, suchte fünf junge Darsteller. Hardy Krüger war ihm aufgefallen, weil er ein guter Boxer war. Hardy Krüger beschreibt die Unterschiede zwischen der Napola (Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalt) und der NS-Eliteschulung in der Adolf-Hitler-Schule. In der Napola musste man vom Zehnmeterbrett springen und zehn Meter unter dem Eis tauchen, dafür fühlte sich die Jugend der Adolf-Hitler-Schule überlegen. Wie ein Schüler auf der Adolf-Hitler-Schule wurde man für sehr wichtige Aufgaben in der Zukunft vorbereitet. Zum Beispiel um Gauleiter von Moskau zu werden. Der Sinn der Adolf-Hitler-Schule war es, auf zukünftigen Plichten vorbereitet zu sein. Aus diesem Grund wurde die Jugend der Adolf-Hitler-Schule in vielen verschiedenen Disziplinen unterrichtet. Diese Disziplinen erstreckten sich über die Weltanschauung, Latein, Mathematik, Englisch, Biologie, Leichtathletik, Waffenkunde, Strategie und Fechten. Das ganze Pensum war natürlich stark beeinflusst durch die Nationalsozialistische Ideologie. Dem Adolf-Hitler-Schüler sollten alle Möglichkeiten offen stehen und der Unterricht war locker, ein krasser Gegensatz zu den restlichen deutschen Schulen. Des Weiteren konnten die Schüler auf der Ordensburg Sonthofen leben.
Hardy war, trotz all dieser Vergünstigungen, nicht glücklich. Im Jahr 1941 schreibt er an seine Eltern: „Glücklich bin ich hier nicht“. Er hatte keine Problem mit der Schleiferei, oder der Politik, aber er vermisste seine Familie. Manchmal empfand Hardy die rauhen Sitten und Ideologien nicht als leicht. Alles geschah, abgesehen von den Unterrichtsstunden, im Kommandoton und Gleichschritt. Außerdem wurden die jüngeren Schüler von den älteren Jahrgängen verprügelt.
Segeln und Fliegen sind auch in seinem späteren Leben seine Hobbys geblieben. Durch die Adolf-Hitler-Schule ist Hardy Krüger Filmschauspieler geworden. Hardy Krügers Erinnerung ist vielleicht typisch für viele Deutsche. Am Anfang sympathisierte er, genau wie seine Eltern, mit Hitler und der Nazi-Partei. Aber später erkannte er wie Hitler wirklich war. Napola ist ein Spielfilm aus dem Jahr 2004. Er erzählt von einer Freundschaft, welche zwei Jungen während ihrer Ausbildung in einer Nationalpolitischen Erziehungsanstalt, oder einfach nur NAPOLA, verbindet. Die zwei Jungen heißen Friedrich Weimer und Albrecht Stein. Friedrich ist wie Hardy ein guter Boxer und kann deshalb ein Napola Schüler werden. Und genau wie Hardy wird Friedrich ausgebildet, um zukünftig ein guter Nazi zu werden. Auch er musste zehn Meter unter Eis tauchen.
Wir haben eine Text über Adolf Hitlers Pädagogik gelesen und wie die Adolf-Hitler-Schule sich auszeichnet. Er ist sachbezogen um die Ideologie und Pädagogik zu untersuchen.
Adolf Hitler sagte: „Von der Jugend hängt die Zukunft des deutschen Volkes ab. Die gesamte deutsche Jugend muss deshalb auf ihre künftigen Plichten vorbereitet werden. Meine Pädagogik ist hart. Das Schwache muss wegehämmert werden. In meinen Ordensburgen wird eine Jugend heranwachsen, vor der sich die Welt erschrecken wird. Eine gewalttätige, herrische, unerschrockene. grausame Jugend will ich.“

Exactly what Switzerland has already.  It has to meet EU regulations when trading with the EU, but that's a different kettle of fish.  It has a bilateral trade agreement - it effects its trade when trading.

&gt;**The matter of the fact is - EU would have much greater say of the conditions that would be included,were we to decide to leave the EU but wanted to keep the trade agreements.** 

They'd have as much say as what Russia has over its regulations, and yet UK and Russian trade is on the increase.

Not a problem (that's going to become a theme to this reply).

&gt;**And I can tell you one thing - they definitely won't include us being able to NOT follow EU regulations.**

Not when trading with the EU, but then again we have to follow Russian, Chinese, Indian, Australian, New Zealand, Canadian, American trade regulations when we trade there, with no say - and trade with all of those is on the up, which is more than can be said for the EU.

Not a problem.

&gt;**Furthermore, The Swiss commission for implementing laws can never discuss or change contents of the bi-literal treaties they need to implement,unlike full EU members.Therefore the Swiss have no influence over the contents of EU law that will apply to them in order to keep the EU single market.**

Don't know if you noticed it but UK trade and economy is by far from in line with other EU countries, not one.  So the idea of the UK having much sway, when it's the commission that writes it anyway, and the UK vote meaning even less after 2014 I don't see what the problem is.  They're a sensible bunch and regulations only apply to the common market and working conditions per se, so if it's good for 26 countries it'll be fine for the UK, and if it's not then there's not much the UK could have done about it anyway - they'd still have to accept them.

In return the UK gets to ditch CAP, CFP, gains a seat on the WTO and can make the most of its Commonwealth connections, it's financial prestiege and growing service sector which isn't best served in EU trade negotiations anyway.

Besides, you're assuming that we don't negotiate a different deal to either Norway or Switzerland where we pay and contribute a lot more than them but get to maintain a vote on what affects us - hence the term 'negotiations'.  5x of Norway's contributions and a little vote in some small matters is no stumbling block.

Not a problem.

&gt;**Not sure how that contributes to the fact that UK should or should not leave the EU. As you said,given that the tertiary economic sector(Services,economic commodities etc) is moving to be the largest part of our economy, I can't see how being out of EU would benefit us or necessarily make BRICK countries or America invest more in the UK.**

Who's the 'K'?!

What it means is that when EU trade talks meet stumbling blocks on goods, where services and finance isn't an issue, the UK could continue to pave ahead.  The UK is a lot more like to find early resolution with Commonwealth countries too...

&gt;**Furthermore, the auto-production and manufacturing STILL plays a significant part in our economy. As you said,UKIP would want to negotiate trade agreements with the EU,while not having to comply with EU legislation - won't happen,EU won't give it to use.** 

Nope.

UKIP is all for complying with EU regulations when trading with the EU.  Just as Australia is all about complying with Canadian regulations when trading with Canada.

Really not a problem.

&gt;**And frankly speaking,on the whole EU is much more significant to us,than we are to them(when comparing them ass all the other EU member states)**

Not a problem.  Nobody is talking about dismissing EU trade.  Straw man.

&gt;**Do you think Companies like Nissan and other Japanese manufacturers will want to remain in the UK? After all they will NOT be able to take the advantage of being based in an EU country and use the EU market.**

I said we would accept that we are talking about 5x the Norwegian contribution and maintaining the 4 pillars; so not a problem and 'yes' of course they would.

You're not even addressing me anymore.  It's like you're having a conversation with my shadow.

&gt;**let's take a look what would happen if we went off the scale and thought - screw it, let's go alone and focus on Commonwealth/ America for our export markets in economic and manufacturing sectoring.**

Nobody is suggesting that.  It's not only a straw man.  It's a scarecrow in an entirely different field, of a different county, to what my position is.

&gt;**But wait- Britain is still huge and surely India,China and America will want to deal with us? Well,yes but on much much worse terms than if we were a part of EU. Why? Because if we are a part of EU,we speak as a group and have a much much larger significance and weight,rather than being on their own.** 

You're just parroting talking points.  If EU trade negotiations focus on what is best for the EU as a whole, but the UK industries aren't representative of the EU as a whole, and where UK industry is especially specialised, then of course it makes sense with our connections to address our specific needs which aren't being met.   The idea that we suddenly get less screwed over is specious.  

&gt;**See above.td;lr who said the Commonwealth would be very willing to ''negotiate'' the finance sector cooperation with the UK,given we wouldn't be in the EU,so technically they couldn't make use of EU wide banking etc,**

Oh You Have To Be Kidding!

Number #1 finance centre in the world with the GFCI putting the closest EU state at #13 with Frankfurt.  

NOT A PROBLEM.  Seriously.

&gt;**[To put the idea that we would need to contribute less to EU budget if we are out of it,at least part of EEA/EFTA to remain in the common market,I'll quote a great article from](http://www.jcm.org.uk/blog/2011/05/why-britain-leaving-the-eu-for-the-eea-or-efta-will-not-solve-any-of-the-anti-eu-crowds-complaints/)**  (I fixed you link format)

Nosemonkey is probably not a great way to go to make an argument but I'll run with it:

             ""Rough maths tells us that, all things being equal, 
              as the UK’s GDP is approximately 5.7 times that 
              of Norway’s, the UK would still need to contribute 
              around 2 billion euros a year to the EU budget if 
              part of the EEA/EFTA. While having no say in what 
              EU laws and regulations we’d still have to follow.""

I said 5x Norway's contribution, *added* the extra contributions not included through CAP and CFP, and instead of saying €10bn which the Nosemonket uses as a 5 year contribution said €25bn!!!  And Britain is still €32bn over the same period better off.

Nosemonkey said Eurosceptics still would be disgruntled.  I'm arguing disgruntled being far superior and now you're not even not addressing my argument but presenting arguments Nosemonkey hasn't even read!!!

&gt;**Even if they were – both also have to pay in to the EU budget proportionate to their economies. Norway currently pays c.340 million euros per annum. This is more than many EU member states – especially when you consider the fact that actual members get money back, reducing their net contributions.**

It's a damn site less than what the UK pays, and look at the comment you are replying to: €25bn over 5 years and still making over a 50% saving.  It's why I said negotiations were called for.  Britain pays way over the top.

&gt;**[In fact, judging from this chart of net contributions](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8036097.stm#start), Norway would – if included in the chart** 

Not a problem.

I started by arguing as terms of negotiations Britain would always remain a net contributor.  Of course Norway and the UK will always contribute more than most given there's 27 countries - but we can contribute a lot less and get a much better deal!  That's the whole argument.

It's literally like you don't want to address my specific point.

&gt;**Because both Norway and Switzerland also – without having any say in their formulation – have to abide by 80-90% of EU rules and regulations in order to be part of the Common Market.**

I'm all for abiding with 100% of Canada's regulations when trading with them too; I've still not taken, for the extra £15bn above Nosemonkey's figures, a pro-EU site trying to undermine the UK's negotiation position, actually justifying that to buy a right to vote in regulations that directly affect the UK either.  Federalisation legislation let them have at it with no UK input.  For an extra €15bn over Nosemonkey's figures of buying into a Norwegian style agreement I want a little more.   And €25bn by the way is an obscene amount over the odds.  Obscene.  I said it as an over-estimate of willful negotiation.

Not a problem.

&gt;**Because you know what you need for a Common Market to function? Common rules and regulations.''**

&gt;**Hope that answers your questions,if you have any more questions or solutions,please fire away ;)**

You barely even addressed what I raised.

You've taken a generic anti-EU argument from the UK which I didn't make and answered it with talking points that don't address what I said.

Because, as always, Europeans are trying to move away from the actual issues by using the trade argument as a distraction. Membership of the EAA is a different argument from membership of the EU. However, ideally, I wouldn't want to be part of either.

&gt;These are the countries the EU has free trade agreements with (and lots of pending and negotiating deals are underway!

I know full well which countries the EU has trade deals with. The issue is that they're decided by the EU and not by the democratically elected British government. Britain cannot go to another country and form a trade deal, that would be against the membership of the EU.

&gt;Of course that would happen, even without EEA incentives, due to the UK's geographical position. 

The UK is close to the Commonwealth due to the common language and historical ties. Even with close proximity to Europe it doesn't change the fact that closer trade ties with the Commonwealth would be beneficial. It is a fact that British trade with Commonwealth countries has suffered as a result of European membership. I would like a deal where Britain decides it's own trade agreements and not have it dictated by some foreigners with which we share nothing in common.

&gt;Sure, the UK can negotiate a separate trade agreement, but it will be nowhere near have the benefits of being in the EEA or the EU. 

The free trade is the only benefit, there is nothing else worth saving from this mess.

&gt;You would still need to abide by a lot of the EU rules. 

This is another fallacy Europeans love to throw around. Britain would only need to obey European rules when trading with Europe, the same as with any other country.

&gt;Romania isn't third world, look up the definition instead of throwing out remarks which you think might insult my home country. I think the world you're looking for is 'developing nation'.

That's just a fancy way of saying ""poor country"". Every country is ""developing"" to a degree. It's poorer than Lebanon and Botswana to put some perspective on just how poor Romania is.

I'm not trying to insult your country in the slightest, it is what it is and the British tax payer does not want to be subsidising it.

&gt;All of the EU countries contribute to the EU, the UK has been historically the second largest contributor, but in recent times France has contributed more. 

This is untrue. For a start, many countries are net beneficiaries (Romania included). These countries get given huge sums of investment at the expense of the strong economies. You can not say that a country gaining more than it gives is contributing, it is leeching.

&gt;There are many other countries with higher contributions per capita than the UK. Nobody is stealing that money from you, it's money used so that all of the member nations, including the UK, continue to enjoy the benefits of the Union. 

What benefits does Britain get exactly? Most of the money is spent on useless bureaucracy, subsiding ""poor"" countries and extravagant building projects. I can see the benefits to Romania, but not to Britain.

&gt;The UK has a say the law making process, all EU nations do, that's why the EU is a democratic union.

The problem is the 26 other countries that also get a say.

&gt;And what does speaking English have to do with it? 

I wish to be able to understand what my leaders are saying and to know that they understand the culture of the country they run.

&gt;Do you know what the European Commission is? It operates akin to a cabinet government and it has 27 members.

Yes, I understand how it works. It's basically a bunch of bureaucrats sitting around dictating our laws. They're supposedly answerable to the European parliament but since that's full of socialists, with the same delusions as the commission, they're not really answerable to anyone. Certainly not answerable to the people.

&gt;What? Please read this so you can understand how international trade works: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade

I know how trade works. You're avoiding the actual point again.

Europe controls all British trade agreements around the world, yet you seem to think I'm saying that Britain does not trade outside of Europe. The irony of the whole thing is that you have the audacity to try and claim that I'm uneducated.

&gt;I am an International Relations student and I can honestly say that I do not envision the UK doing better outside the EU.

                     94 per cent of population of the Commonwealth

Small countries have greater potential for growth and as for not being able to trade with INDIA who has the lion share of the Commonwealth population: come on, you're not even half expecting anyone to swallow that!

Oh, you're absolutely right...Australia and Canada are only small populations so even though they're huge economies, and although India is a colossus on the horizon, and that that's exactly where the growth is, that they're in no way compensation - despite trade deficits being at a historic low at a time EU trade is dropping, slack picked up by these very same countries...*and completely negating the fact that nobody is talking about dropping EU trade.*

The point to the EU is that every country receives a lot of benefits but also has to give back something to the common good of the union, and the benefits always outweigh the contributions.     
And when you want to look on the quality of life in a country, the HDI inequality adjusted index is a better bet than GDP per capita. Also Romania is really getting very few of those EU funds mostly due to bad governance, and I could also say that Germany is subsidizing the UK (which it is in some ways), does that hurt your national pride?               
                       
You need to get over the fact that UK was once a great power, because it isn't anymore, and being in the EU the UK gets a lot better trade deals than it would on it's own. To put it in simple terms, who do you think has more pull in a negotiation, the country with a 60 million population and 2 trillion $ economy or a supranational organization encompassing 500 million people in a 15 trillion $ economy?             
You need to understand the facts, the UK's economy is minuscule compared to the EU, China and the US, and a lot of other developing nations like Brazil, Russia and India for that matter (and soon nations like Turkey, Indonesia and Mexico will have bigger economies than the UK).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;**OK. Now I am pretty confused,where you get your figures and so forth.**

&gt;**So,Let's set the record straight. Your main argument on why we should pull out of the EU is because we could get the same deals or even better while being £32bn better off over a 5 year period?**

Good call.  



€32bn better off over a 5 year period, yes, with the figures I used of 'even if' we contributed so much.   Currently the net deficit over 5 years is [€57bn](http://www.openeurope.org.uk/Content/Documents/PDFs/budget07.pdf).  If you have another figure you want to use then by all means provide it and I'll revise, but good luck because the EU has yet to *pass* an audit.  Literally.  They have auditors.  Never seem to pass one though, which is in itself a huge problem.  Every other country can say how much it makes, how much it taxes, how much it spends, and where the respective budgets are.  When it comes to the EU it becomes guesstimates and approximations.

If you do want to take some pro-EU produced figures [here they are](http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2012/01/26/EU27_Money.pdf) (as opposed to some EU sceptical figures - don't read anti-EU figures, they're not), my figures still show a net profit for what I propose, and these figures don't include the contributions the UK must still add themselves, after being awarded an EU grant, that they must match to be able to spend, even if it's not efficient to do so.  They also doesn't include what would be saved by allowing control of our own agricultural policy and the extra money earned from ditching the CFP...but it gives you an idea.  Without adding all that up, even still my figures work out as cheaper for the UK, and in reality the figures are going to be somewhere in between.  Oh, and the UK rebate has gone down and the contributions up since then, so there's that.  Something to bare in mind...

So if I take the Norwegian contribution (you said €340m year^-1 , it's actually gone up, I rounded it to €500m, Nosemonkey goes even higher at around €650m, but I addressed that to later by rounding up again), €500m per year over 5 years, €2.5bn.  

Nosemonkey then used the same factor that I did, that the UK is around 5x greater in size, so a Norwegian contribution converted to UK size is around €12.5bn over 5 years (Nosemonkey for some reason just said €10bn over 5 years so using pro-EU figures I'm actually weighing it more in their favour still to make my point).
 
I then DOUBLED it, because the UK is not just negotiating Norwegian terms but UK terms and they want something extra for their buck.

€57bn deficit over 5 years, minus €25bn in a new agreement, over 5 years, still makes the UK €32bn up and all that extra to what the Norwegians are paying, above the 5x scale to equate size, buys the UK a huge chip at the negotiation table.

If you didn't understand what I meant, it was because I scaled for argument's sake the contribution the UK should pay, above and beyond what Norway pays when scaling up for size or GDP, to make a point.

Even when I massively over exaggerate it, the UK is still quids up.

&gt;Roughly 2bn. is still a lot of money to contribute for the privilege of EU,but the fact that we are ''at the negotiation table'' with 2nd highest number of MPs(even if this might go down from 2014) as well as giving us crucial position in relation to negotiations regarding Europe -after alll we are part of Europe,it's certainly not money spent bad.

Nope, not money badly spent at all.

We'd still be a net contributor, saving over 50%, still be able to negotiate the UKs own terms (not Swiss or Norwegian terms but UK terms, and we're paying for it), and get back all the Norwegians have - command of their own agricultural policy (CAP isn't designed to suit UK farms which are based on a model different to Europe), scrap CFP in UK waters, gain a seat on the WTO and give us freedom to capitalise on our unique position in the EU with our connections to the Commonwealth.  And then with all that extra contribution buy rights to vote on regulation that affects the UK but not on any policy that does not, and not be part of a new federalised EU zone.

It's not a big ask, still big contributors, and the EU themselves may benefit from Commonwealth subsidaries and business drawn into the UK.

Not bad at all.

&gt;**I am sure there are other legal,trading and political benefits/perks for being part of EU rather than EEA which companies choosing the UK as their starting market consider,**

Name some outside of the 4 pillars.

Don't mention the fact that the EU is a big trading bloc on a global scene because that trading bloc which has to consider the EU as a whole and not individual countries, by statute, does not primarily represent the primary sectors of the UK by default.

&gt;**but I am afraid I don't have that much in depth legal knowledge to tell you all of them.**

Then how can you be sure?

Name some however.  I'm sure I can offset them with the major UK industries which aren't keystones of EU trade negotiations when representing 27 countries that have different economies to the UK.

If an EU trade negotiation with Singapore stalls and is held back for 6 or 12 months over goods trade relevant to Mediterranean economies, I can tell you now the UK couldn't give a damn, even if one or two or even fifty good based UK SMEs do, with the emphasis on the 'S', as far as they are concerned.  The UK is far more concerned why a trade negotiation broke down over goods when they really want to focus on capitalising on their growing financial and service sectors worth billions in potential mutual trade, just because London is the only financial sector giant in the EU and as such not an overall EU27 priority  - and I can tell you now Singapore will be asking the same questions too!

We can still capitalise on the goods later on through the single market, but in the mean time strike up a separate finance and service agreement that doesn't much interest the rest of the 26 countries, and spend any spare time kicking up trade with our friends in the Commonwealth - without having to dawdle on waiting for an EU Trade Commissioner.",0,1340331257,null,0,1340332639,0,c53vztp,t3_ve941,t1_c53vztp,t1_c53vgfx,null,1429200282,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;**[Nop, your own source -](http://www.openeurope.org.uk/Content/Documents/PDFs/budget07.pdf) Page 5**  

&gt;**Deficit - 38.2 billion**

From Page 5:  

              ""The Government has now responded by publishing 
               its projection for French net contributions (though 
               only for France and not other member states).The 
               Government claims that France will pay up to 
               €48.3bn, while the UK will pay up to €57.5bn over 
               the period.""

UK government figures: €57.5 billion NET revised up from earlier central estimates from the 2005 Pink Book. 


 **REVISED FIGURE FROM THE UK GOVERNMENT LEAKED AND THEN REPORTED: €57 BILLION NET LOSS + REBATE REDUCTION SINCE.**  
 

It took UK pressure for the French government to release its own 'projections' of money spent. No,  Signed. Audit.  The European auditors can't show where its money comes from.  It comes down to in house bickering and lobby groups to project, and even then its open to interpretation. 
The rebate has begun being handed back since then too, so consider that in mind with the figures.

Notice the table you linked to said 'central estimate' and even those are less favourable than the pro-EU perspective figures I provided you with, and still showed my working for a profitable renegotiation.


^^...but ^^having ^^said ^^all ^^that ^^I'm ^^still ^^willing ^^to ^^take ^^a ^^far lower ^^pro-EU ^^deficit ^^figure ^^for ^^the ^^UK,  ^^and ^^to ^^show ^^renegotiation ^^to ^^be ^^eminently ^^more ^^profitable ^^still.

&gt;**Interestingly, compare the 2009 aisle with (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_the_European_Union) a difference of 1bn. Seriously?**

Y'up.  The rebate began to be reduced.  Tony Blair agreed for it to start being handed over.  Getting the idea for why there's a growing resentment yet?  They simply take the projected/estimated figures and detract from the know rebate loss, knowing the overall contribution is going up - although they're stuck in the realm of knowing how much because it depends how much of open EU investment is claimed because much of it calls for a 1:1 domestic investment and it can often end up going through Quangos.  Ask the government how many Quangos there are and they can't tell you.  How do we know?  We asked them in the 00s and they couldn't answer.  That's how confusing it gets.

&gt;**Thus,now when we have this 38 billion deficit let's say over the next 5 years, we could take your approach and see what happens if we contribute in the style of Norway,from you estimates that would be €25bn. So, 38-25 = 13billion over 5 years.** 

&gt;**So the UK would be better of by 13 billion over 5 years,rather than 32. bn.**

Using the very lowest pro-EU ball figures, and not the UK's own government figures Britain would still be better off, even me with arguing a way over inflated contribution compared to the likes of Norway to open up further negotiation, Britain would still be better off with all 4 pillars (freedoms) and a common market open to it.

You just said it yourself.  *Better off.*

In addition it would receive control of its agriculture, save its fishing and regain a seat on the WTO, and negotiation rights with the Commonwealth.

Even before further negotiation, as a starting off point of what Norway already has and paying much more than Norway when scaled up to UK size!!!

*You're making my point.   And €15bn of that €25bn you detracted is over compensation as an example of how the UK can buy negotiation voting rights for regulations which affect the UK which Norway doesn't have.  That's a helluva lot, doesn't even have to be remotely that close.*

&gt;**In relation to your 4 pillars, as far as I am aware there were only 3 pillars(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_pillars_of_the_European_Union) and they have been combined into (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) for quite a while since 2009.**

Three pillars relates to the legal infrastructure.

My bad if it didn't carry over but the four pillars of freedom: 

            ""guarantee the free movement of goods, capital, 
             services, and people"" 

Essentially the primary UK interest in even being involved (although I did actually call it 'Four Freedoms' much earlier on in the thread.)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms_(European_Union)

&gt;**We seem to think that it'll be very easy and government can organise that. Obviously not - it's the matter of Businesses trying to find demand in those markets.**

We already are!  We just don't have room to capitalise on it.  Trade in the Commonwealth is growing, trade with the EU is shrinking.  It's a case of *allowing* business to exploit the potential for growth, which isn't happening.  

&gt;**There is no point or necessarily reason to believe that the agreements that haven't been established or finalised now with commonwealth countries,will be after we exit the EU.**

Exit from the EU or even from the EEA with the same deals isn't even being discussed here!!!  Renegotiation is.

There's plenty of reason to speculate even if it were that the exact same terms couldn't be carried over.  Nobody in these times is going to just cut off trade for the hell of it.  It's just silly to even speculate so.

&gt;**- EU Trade Commissioner. - It's there for a reason,ensuring protection for both the customers in the UK and businesses exporting from the UK to these markets.**

Again, and I'm sorry, but this just displays a deeply flawed understanding on how EU trade missions are run.  They're obliged to run representing the whole.  The UK economy is simply not indicative of the whole.  We're strong in completely different sectors.  It's like when you said that outsiders wouldn't want to contend with the UK rahter than the whole EU financial sectors, which the UK drowns (and isn't even an issue of either or). 

&gt;**The whole fact about that UK economy not representing of EU economies - good,then we can find this gap and encourage even greater use of London within EU,rather than out of it.**

I'm getting tired of this because it's clear you don't understand it yet.  We can't!  It has to go through the EU Trade Commissioner.  If we can negotiate our own terms then we CAN find that gap.  

No matter how much people disagree with the UKIP or Scetpic argument, however much they disagree, they don't doubt that the EU Trade Commissioner is huge.  Epic.  That it is beyond doubt amongst even those in Parliament who would want to break them on the stony sea-shore rocks beneath, that it is a fact that the EU Trade Commission agrees trade rights for the whole of the EU27 before allowing individuals to make their individual 1:1 business bids on it.  It has to go through the EU.  After an agreement is met, then they can go and find gaps, but the EU makes/determines the holes and gaps with trade outside of the EU...and that's crazy for the one major state with links to the Commonwealth.  The other EU states inside the Commonwealth are Malta and Cyprus.  Irrelevant in the bidding terms but they'd love it if the UK said as a big brother, 'extra help here boys as well as the EU'.  We could bring Portugal along too as a non-Commonwealth but with long ties to the UK.  

You all stay part of the EU, we'll buy rights as a large body and net contributor and secure rights to the rest of the Commonwealth, you'll cash it in through subsidiaries through us.  Portugal, old friend, part of the PIGS, that's the UK contribution to the EU problem - Cyprus can come along too. The UK can't bail out the Euro Zone, but it can certainly pull Portugal back on its own, and Cyprus and then give them some business which the ECB is struggling to allow through its polarity of dealing with ~27 states at once, which is exactly why Spain is suffering.

&gt;**There's nothing to hold back the UK from negotiating with each country in the world,be it commonwealth or anything else,**

Outright wrong.  The UK doesn't even hold a seat on the World Trade Organisation anymore - it's an EU position now.  We're not talking about one business dealing with another business overseas, we're talking about establishing trade routes, overall terms, duties, imports, between sovereign heads of state.  It goes through the EU.  That's ridiculous for a country like the UK with its contacts, shared culture, history and relationship with the Commonwealth.  It's like a possessive girlfriend saying you can only see your friends if they call her first to make sure it's okay.

&gt;**OK,it's clearly enough for today. If you feel like the UK should get out,**

They don't need to migrate. Turkey's economy is doing better than any economy of Europe, we don't need the extra burden of supporting low-skilled workers.

You're confusing Native American culture with the cultures of the New World. They have history together, just like Japan has history with the US, but that doesn't mean they're culturally similar. The situation between Americans and Italians was different because Italy doesn't have a huge unprotected border with Arab nations, one of which is practically in civil war. It also didn't have a large Kurdish population. Not to mention that their religion was the same, except perhaps denomination. They didn't go there with and Arabo-centric religion.

The UK is fiscally conservative, and where others have been more flamboyant with spending (greece, spain) they've managed to fuck everything up. 

The simple fact is, the Brits don't trust the Europeans not to fuck everything up. If Europe wants control over one of the biggest economies in the world (by no means the biggest) then they are going to have to accept that Britain will have its say, as it is entitled.

Language really is the major issue here. You'll always be a foreigner if you can't easily communicate with the majority of the population.

I eventually broke up with her 4-5 years later and chose to live with my parents again for a little while because it means that I have approximately 800 euros extra (after all my other expenses are dealt with) per month to spend on stupid crap, entertainment and savings.

A lot of people think that living with your parents is some evil thing that clamps down on your freedoms. Yes.. it's a bit like this before you initially move out, but by the time you come back they don't really mess with you anymore.

Hint: it's more about earning your own money and ~~bribing~~ helping them out, while benefiting yourself with really cheap accommodation and food. It sorta makes sense because it also gives you the capability to save up on some cash and buy expensive stuff.. like a good car -- or you can be like ""har har har... I am so awesome that I live all by myself and I run out of money by the 20th of the month -- but at least I'm in control"" :)

One bedroom apartment ~= 450-500 euros per month

Building Common expenses ~= 50 euros per month

Municipality taxes ~= 100-200 euros per year

Electricity bill ~= 200-500 euros per 2 months (every other month you know you're gonna have a damn good month)

Water bill ~= 70 euros per 4 months

Internet Bill ~= 50-75 euros per month depending on the speed

Food ~= 200+ euros per month (especially if you are addicted to good quality bacon like I am) -- you can cut down here if you wanna eat rice every other day.

and any other random expenses you never thought of.. a light bulb blew? 8+ euros (gotta replace it with LED.. you know? hehe). Better hope a pipe doesn't start leaking or something. Then you have other expenses that you make.. smoke cigarettes? 100-150 euros per month... petrol? 100-200 euros per month depending on the usage, going out? 10-50 euros every time etc etc etc.. mobile phone credit? gas heating/cooking.. don't forget the gas cylinder.. shampoo? shower gel? deodorant? smelly shit to smell good.. designer label that sounds like ""Goathair"" or whatever? another 50+ euros... it all adds up in the end :)


Living with parents: 300-400 euros per month, everything included &lt;-- really good deal

tl;dr: Living completely on your own really sucks. I'm only gonna move out of my parents' again when I find a decent girlfriend again and we make arrangements to live together... it's just not worth paying for all of this extra stuff just to be alone in a flat just to pretend you're doing really awesome because you're independent :)",0,1340358941,null,0,1340362233,0,c540o2s,t3_vffml,t1_c540o2s,t3_vffml,null,1429202612,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

true,MilaMoon,null,null,"It really depends on where you are living and what you want to study since not every subject is available in every university. If I look at my former class (age 18-20 at that time) 60% of my classmates went to study and about 50% of those moved out of home, whereas the other 50% stayed home and commuted every day to their university. The 40% which did not start to study stayed home and did some training on the job. Since these are not so well paid, they moved out of home later (age 23-25). By now (age 28-30) still 15% live at home.
It is different for people who leave school at 16. They normally stay home for at least 3 years, since they just don't get enough money out of their jobs to pay for their own apartment. And it is a bit more difficult to move out of home before you turn 18, since you can't sign a lease at that age.

From my own view I'm really glad that I moved out directly after I finished school (age 19). Learning how to be independent and care for myself helped me a lot and I just can't imagine to have lived that long with my parents. I learned how to do groceries without having too much/little at home afterwards, cooked my own dinners (went ~10 times to the cafeteria during my whole time in university), learned how to deal with banks, landlords etc. ",0,1340362239,null,0,false,0,c540xh6,t3_vffml,t1_c540xh6,t1_c540u6b,null,1429202738,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

My god... Freedom of ottoman rule and unite with mother bulgaria was their purpose. On the other hand the greeks in this region wanted to unite macedonia with the rest of Greece. As the ottoman rule was fanding the battle for this region was between Greece and Bulgaria. The people there were bulgarians and greeks both calling themselves macedonians, it was a second title. Brainwashing them? the slavic population (you) there knew that they were primary bulgarians the brainwashing and psycholgically pressure started with Tito in Serbias land. Thats why this person is so important in our story. Greeks hating macedonians right? Thats the shit they feed you in your schools? Mad bcz he conqured Greece? No pal. He united Greece agains the common enemy Persians. We worship Alexander as our hero as a Great Greek macedonian not a Slavic one. I love the history and land of macedonia all the heros and philosophers i am macedonian bcz macedonia and greece as sparta and athens and cryte with greece are one and hellenic since forever. But i hate the Slavs who are trying to hijack this from me. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek  this is the dialect that the ancient macedonians were speaking. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_dialect and this is were it dereved from. Couldnt understand huh? right. Writers from old ages also document a huge a mount of hate between Athenians and Spartans. So that means im currently hating Leonidas or Alcibiates? Athenians had once allied even with the Persians (the primary enemy of all greeks. Btw as i told you this is why Alexander started his journey to crush this big enemy.) to defeat Spartans. This is the kind of hate they had between them. Ancient Greece was not united there was hate, plot between the city kingdomns and war was happening very often. Yea 400 years of ottoman rule are certainly influence culture but sorry we are not related. I speak and write modern greek that is based on the old one that all of hellenes (including macedonians) spoke with just different tonal system. You on the other hand speak a cyrillic language that was created at 10th century in First bulgarian Empire a language exactly similar with the bulgarian one. Oh whats this! a DNA test! You guys seem to love DNA tests, genes and blood so much. Might want to make a search about an institute of a man called Dr Zlatko Jakovski. He condacted a reaserch and talked about the origins of the people living in FYR macedonia. Let me tell you more that this institute is in Skopje!(omg,surprise). But your goverment is basically hiding this too. Genes doesnt make a nation pal. language and culture does and curently nothing of these are similar with the ancient ones. Thats what they throw at you to hide you from the big picture. We got hold of agean macedonia 100 years ago and you always been there? im sorry but do you even try to think before you spit the shit out of your mouth. have i been mentioning the Byzantine empire just for nothing?  &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_Byzantine_Empire_1025-en.svg &gt;&gt; A greek speaking (latin second language) kingdom that holded 1 milenium ,before it falls to ottomans, with people of the same languege religion culture. Or i guess im just wrong again and it was yours filled with Slavs (who btw start caming 300-350 years after its form) speaking an non-existed alien language.WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE NO CONNECTED WITH THEM, YOU ARE TRYING TO FIND A LIKN WITH A HISTORY THAT IS NOT YOURS. There was no seperate Spartan, Athenian, Macedonian, Mynoites at Byzantine they all united and form a greater kingdom under the one language and religion (christianity at that time). Grecum imperium and the people were called greeks by the Romans , Byzantium imperia by us calling ourselves hellens(έλληνες) since always, Yunanistan by ottomans and persians, eastern roman empire before the division of Rome, . Let me ask you before the romans conquered Greece, macedonian dynasty were rulling it. Why there was no difference in culture language and gods and thus remane it something deferent after the romans? Bcz let me tell you macedonians were as spartans, athenians ,minoytes all self-declaring hellens first. But damn they didnt have DNA tests to know that thei ''genes'' might were a bit different... The ''boohoohoo we always been here boohoohoo'' is nothing but bullshit and comes in contrast with the history and nations of ALL of the people of Balkans. The faster you understand it the better will be for you. The new macedonian nation (you) was created by Tito in order to serve specific political purposes and is closer (almost similar) to Serbs and Bulgarians.

true,Mordisquitos,null,null,"It's not technically true that you have to _carry_ an ID with you at all times, but for all intents and purposes you might as well:

As a foreigner, [you are obliged to have](http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo1-1992.html#a11), but not necessarily carry, the documents that prove you are legally in the country. That would basically mean your passport with a correct entry stamp, and I guess in that regard the law is the same virtually everywhere. As I say, you needn't actually carry it with you. Leave it in the hotel safety box if it feels safer for you.

What is true, however, is that _""within the course of their investigations or preventive measures""_ the Police and Guardia Civil [are authorised to ask for you to identify yourself](http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo1-1992.html#a20). What constitutes a valid ID is at the officer's discretion (except for ID cards and passports, which he cannot refuse). If the police officer is not satisfied that he has positively ID'd you and believes it is necessary for the current *""investigative or preventive procedures""* , he may take you to a police station (this is not an arrest) for identification procedures.

Generally, a police officer will not randomly ask for your ID and arrest you for not carrying it (as you have not broken any law). In practice, the _very worst_ that can happen  (and you'd have to be terribly unlucky) is that you are a suspect in a crime or misdemeanour, the police ask for your ID, believe it is fake, and take you in to the police station for questioning. This would be a hassle but is not a crime in itself. As long as you are helpful with regards to your identity (resisting identification _is_ against the law) and tell them the hotel where you're staying at so they can check your passport if they wanted to, you would not get into any trouble.

So, to summarise:

+ You will almost certainly not be randomly asked to identify yourself, and failing to provide ID is not a crime (but it is a hassle).
+ If you _are_ randomly asked to identify yourself, a U.S. driver's licence with a photo would almost certainly satisfy a police officer unless you're in a damn suspicious situation (say, someone was just robbed by a guy who looks just like you and you are sneaking behind a tree).
+ If you want to really be sure, carry a photocopy of your passport including the page with the entry stamp (though I'm pretty sure no police officer will believe an American is in Spain illegally). If they need to see the original, refer them to your hotel.
+ As mentioned below, carrying a photo ID is always a good idea for buying stuff with a credit or debit card.

And, even though you didn't ask about this, there have occasionally been gangs who attempt to pass themselves as police officers to try to get their hands on passports or money. It's been ages since I've heard of this, and I'm pretty sure it's an **extremely rare occurrence that's only well known because of news coverage**. To guard yourself against this:

+ Be immediately wary of plain clothes policemen asking for your ID when there are no uniformed officers or police cars in sight. This may sound racist, but if in addition to that said plain clothes policemen don't look Spanish it's almost certainly a scam. Refuse, tell them you will not comply until they call a patrol car, and if necessary dial 091 (police) or 112 (general emergencies, like 911).
+ Don't carry your actual passport. If you do, know that [it cannot be confiscated or withheld under any circumstances](http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo1-1992.html#a11). A legitimate police officer might take it for a time while he radioes your details to the station, but no more. The moment an apparent police officer appears reluctant to return it, dial 091 or 112.
+ There is no such thing as an on the spot fine for failing to provide ID. This is another scam.

Referencing 'fishing quotas policy beating Labour' and UKIP winning in UK European elections...

I'd hazard a guess and that they're the equivalent of the Iron Lands and that they're not best pleased.  The Common Fisheries Policy to the UK, in such  locations, is like mandating that Audi has to have Russian Lada parts in every engine block.

Not. Best. Pleased.  In.  The.  Purest.  British.  Sense.  Even.  Though.  They're.  From.  Scrumpy.  Land.

And by that I mean:

They're not just flipping tables; the tables are through the wall. 

UKIP traditionally does well in the South-west.

Speaking as someone from the UK that's EU-sceptical but not anti-EU, and talking to someone from Germany whose country is aparently pushing for federalism (and not warning in any sort of malicious or threatening way, or have any xenophobic problems with Germans (I actually think you're the most like us, if ever you want to get rid of the neighbours  and live in Wales I'm sure we could arrange a good deal - might be a little crowded, but it'd be fun.)) - be very, very wary of the 2014 UK European Elections.

In actual fact Angela Merkel did a pretty decent thing (not too sure how you rate her) after France basically blocked the UK's concerns.  Don't know if you realise it but she did actually try to console and bring the UK back into the fold to make amends.  Rather than demands and armour Cameron walked in with pretty reasonable requests and more of a fig leaf.  It didn't end publicised in the press that way; either he was a prize bastard or St George himself incarnate.  A journalist did get hold of his bucket list though (Guardian or Financial Times) and it wasn't that bad.  Sarkozy said, 'Non - absolutement', and Cameron had to walk away.

Domestically I don't know how you feel about her, but I at least have respect for her and Germany for that.

You shouldn't have a problem getting into Chez Denise and Le Relias without reservations (go on an empty stomach. American sized portions are served. Classic French cuisine), but the others are highly recommended to do in advance. Frenchie has been difficult to get into, so if you're going to be there in September, I'd suggest you get on the phone now to reserve.


L'atelier du Joel Robuchon - you shouldn't have a problem getting a reservation, just call a few days before. I fully agree with SebNL on going to this one.

If you do struggle with the French language, or are a bit shy, you could always email the restaurants or check to see if they're listed on www.thefork.com, which does online reservations.

true,Feint1,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;To cut this argument short, I see no real way I could help change your views as you already have well embedded beliefs that the EU is bad, most of which from what I can observe is due to lack of knowledge on how the EU actually works.

Everyone with even a basic understand of the European Union knows that it's a disastrous agreement.

&gt;The point to the EU is that every country receives a lot of benefits but also has to give back something to the common good of the union, and the benefits always outweigh the contributions.

The benefits do not outweigh the contributions. There is no benefit to the British tax payer who are being forced to subsidies poorer countries. The only thing you're right on is the free trade zone being good for British business, but that is completely unrelated to the EU.

&gt;Also Romania is really getting very few of those EU funds mostly due to bad governance, and I could also say that Germany is subsidizing the UK (which it is in some ways), does that hurt your national pride? 

Great Britain isn't subsidised by any nation. Germany has actually been trying to get the UK to pay towards the European bailout mechanism which is basically begging for more money.

The UK rebate is not a subsidy, it's all British money to begin with. It's liking robbing and old man of £100 and giving him 5 quid back.

In 2011 Romania gained a net benefit of €1,609 million while the United Kingdom lost €3,865 million. Greece gained €3,009 and Germany lost €8,797.

So while Germany is paying more it certainly isn't subsidising the United Kingdom. Romania, however, is leeching off Anglo-German money.

[Citation, if needed](http://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD/PROD0000000000273546.pdf)

&gt;You need to get over the fact that UK was once a great power, because it isn't anymore, and being in the EU the UK gets a lot better trade deals than it would on it's own. To put it in simple terms, who do you think has more pull in a negotiation, the country with a 60 million population and 2 trillion $ economy or a supranational organization encompassing 500 million people in a 15 trillion $ economy?

The United Kingdom is a Great power. Not only is it in the G8, the UNSC and the G20 it has diplomatic missions to hundreds of countries. Great Britain would have no problems sorting out trade agreements, countries with less than half the influence manage to strike good deals. But under the current system Britain can make zero trade deals, so it's not like we can do any worse by regaining independence.

&gt;You need to understand the facts, the UK's economy is minuscule compared to the EU, China and the US, and a lot of other developing nations like Brazil, Russia and India for that matter (and soon nations like Turkey, Indonesia and Mexico will have bigger economies than the UK). 

The UK's economy is huge. It is larger than many of these countries you're trying to compare it to. But the actual size of the economy is not the issue, it's the per capita wealth. Countries like Iceland and Switzerland are outside of the EU yet they're do fine. Their economies are actually stronger than Britain's is.

Germany has been held back for decades with the cost of developing east Germany, and now it has to help subsidies southern and eastern Europe. Germany may benefit from the Eurozone but it also suffers from it greatly.

&gt;Sure, the EU can be improved in a lot of ways, but withdrawing from the Union is not how a country can act to make things better. 

A British withdrawal would make Britain better. What happens to the rest of the union is irrelevant to me.

&gt;Edit: I found a list of how the EU is benefiting the UK:

&gt; Wie gelangt von der IP an den Täter?

Die ermittelnde Behörde erbittet Auskunft beim Provider der diese IP zugeteilt hat (Kann jeder mittels DNS Lookup rausfinden zu welchem Provider die Addresse gehört). Dieser Provider sieht dann in seinen Logs nach welchem Anschluss diese IP zum entsprechenden Zeitraum zugeteilt war. Bei erfolgreichem Abgleich gibt der ISP dann in der Regel die Daten des Anschlussinhabers (merke: Nicht des Nutzers!) an die Behörden weiter und diese wenden sich dann dementsprechend an den Anschlussinhaber. Anschlussinhaber kann dabei alles sein ... das örtliche McCafe/Starbucks mit anonymem Wifi, jemand dessen WLan man benutzen darf, die örtliche Bibliothek oder Universität mit entsprechendem Zugang etc.

Der Hauptunterschied ist dass ohne VDS die Anbieter nur zur Zwecken der Rechnungsabwicklung speichern dürfen und danach löschen müssen. Die VDS soweit ich das verstehe sieht allerdings vor sämtliche Daten bis zu sieben Monate zu speichern ob sie nun mit Rechnungslegung zu tun haben oder nicht. Man speichert halt ""Auf Vorrat"" mal alle Daten weil man vielleicht irgendwann welche davon gebrauchen kann.

Provider dürfen z.B. laut Landgericht Darmstadt und anderer Vereinbarungen nur noch maximal sieben Tage eine IP vorhalten. Bei der VDS im Sinne von Herrn Friedrich wären das sieben Monate. 

Der Themenkomplex ist ziemlich weitgreifend und man sollte sich da besser selbst einlesen.

The classic/normal card is a card where you attach your monthly magnetic stripe ticket you buy on the estanco.

Now they are phasing out to this modern contactless cards beginning with the ""young discount"" cards. Also, the new cards expiration date isn't on the last day of the month current when you buy your monthly ticket, but 30 days after you buy it, so you could, i.e. get tickets from 15th to 15th, or 7th to 7th, depending on your needs.

I'm not really sure but I think you still can get the classic card on a estanco. The procedure used to be you went into a estanco with an id sized photo, gave your info, and came back like in three or four days when they receive your card done.

Anyway, through the same webpage I gave you for getting the new 'contactless', you can get an ""appointment"" to get your card done in a ""card management office"".

Are you basing this claim on statistics, or is it just a personal guess?

&gt; It doesn't matter if 11m people have nothing to do with these incidents

No, it doesn't. The link doesn't claim anywhere that ""all Greeks are Nazis"" or something ridiculous like that. What it does is highlight a series of shocking, violent and apparently racist attacks against immigrants. And yes, those should be reported on, period. Especially if they are perpetrated by supporters of a party that just entered parliament with 7% of the vote. 

It doesn't matter if the rest of the 11m Greeks have nothing to do with them - it's an important subject by itself. Just like extremist violence against Roma in Hungary and its ties to the booming far right parties and movements should be reported on, and have often been reported on. Or the racist attacks on immigrants in Russia. You're not being singled out and persecuted by the press.

I mean, what is your alternative? Are you suggesting those attacks should not be reported on, because it might make the rest of Greece look bad? Or are you suggesting some kind of rule that would oblige a reporter, whenever reporting on something negative in any country, to add a sentence about how ""most [people of country in which bad thing happened] are not like this""? 

The report already includes quite a bit of information about how some Greeks are protesting against these attacks and trying to protect migrants, so it's not like it paints all Greeks as bad. It just reports on a series of shocking events, as you would want a journalist to do. No reason for the ""oh us poor maligned nation"" victim routine.

&gt; Similarly, a few Neo-Nazis marched in Berlin and suddenly all Germans became Nazis.

I've seen a lot of news reports about the violence which neo-Nazis perpetrate in Germany, and I'm glad that that shit is being reported on. I have not seen any article make the claim that it means that ""all Germans are Nazis"", and neither does this article say something like that about Greece.

If you have far right extremists attacking minorities, you have a problem, and it should be reported on - just like it is when it happens here in Hungary.
