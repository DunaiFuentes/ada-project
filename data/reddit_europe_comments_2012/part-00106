If you consider travelling by train, good stops ""on the way"" could be Strasbourg, Cologne or Brussels, as each of those are good connected both to Munich and Paris.

You could, for example, go:

Munich - Frankfurt. Take a quick look at the skyscraper skyline and than hop on an IC-train from 

Frankfurt - Cologne, along the scenic Rhine-route with all the castles and stuff (there are two trainroutes between Frankfurt-Cologne: The highspeed route is - as often with highspeed routes(!) - boring for sightseeing along the way. The old, slow route is along the Rhine).

Then maybe spend a day in Cologne and travel from there nonstop to Paris. Or go from Cologne to Brussels, see Brussels and then off to Paris.

- Stopovers usually do not make a trainticket more expensive
- Check airline prices as well, if money is important
- If you look to buy cheaper tickets in advance, also check prices for 1st class. Sometimes the cheaper prices for 2nd class savings are already well sold out, so one can get a 1st class ticket for almost the same price as a 2nd class ticket
- Your family could also check on prices to book the inner-european travelling already in the US along with their overseas ticket. That can be sometimes cheaper.
- Cheaper Group train tickets start at 6 people AFAIK, so you might wanna check into those as well. (I don't think you need 6 people, as someone could get sick, etc.)

true,2k1,null,null,"laengers Zitat von FeFe:

Dammbruch bei Kabel Deutschland: Neue AGBs mit Bandbreitendrosselung bei Filesharern. Konkret kriegen Kunden nur noch 100 KBit/sec durch ihre Leitung, wenn sie pro Tag mehr als 10 GB Traffic verursachen.

Das ist der erste große Breitband-Internet-Anbieter, der so offen die Netzneutralität verletzt. Insofern ist der Beißreflex jetzt natürlich, da voll gegenzukloppen. Ich bin da Kunde und daher ""Betroffener"".

Leider ist die Sache nicht so einfach, wer da jetzt der Gute ist. Ich will mal ein paar Details auflisten. Erstens drosselt KDG schon immer. Ich habe auf dem Papier 32 MBit Downstream. Tagsüber habe ich um die 2 MB/sec Downloadrate, nachts um die 4 MB/sec. Ich finde auch 2 MB/sec in Ordnung, bei der Telekom hab ich in Stoßzeiten noch deutlich weniger als die Hälfte der Bandbreite gesehen.

Zweitens ruckelt Youtube bei KDG nicht. Das war für mich eine völlig neue Erfahrung. Da war bei der Telekom nicht dran zu denken. Das ging gar nicht. Wenn das Shaping der Preis dafür ist, dass Dienste wie Youtube nicht ruckeln, bin ich das zu zahlen bereit.

Ich habe mich vorhin mit ein paar Kumpels darüber unterhalten. Da kamen dann ein paar Argumente, die ich spannend finde. Erstens: Das ist ein Shared Medium, da muss man shapen. Zweitens: sollen sie doch shapen, aber dann sollen sie auch ungeshaped Internet anbieten.

Ich finde beide Argumente falsch. Erstens weil alle Internetzugangstechnologien ein Shared Medium sind. Auch DSL wird massiv überbucht. Mir als Kunde ist das wurscht, ob die Daten nicht bei mir ankommen, weil das letzte oder das vorletzte Stück Leitung überlastet ist. Das Argument ""aber das ist ein shared medium"" kann ich nicht gelten lassen.

Das Argument ""aber dann sollen sie bitte auch ungeshaped anbieten"" klingt sinnvoll. Aber mal auf den Tisch mit den Fakten. Wenn man in großen Kontingenten Traffic einkauft, kommt man für 100 MBit nicht auf 30 Euro pro Monat, eher so 150, mit Kosten für die Infrastruktur und Wartung des Providers sagen wir mal 200. Gut, sagt jetzt vielleicht der eine oder andere, das wäre ich zu zahlen bereit. Aber wäre nicht das erst die eigentliche Netzneutralitätsverletzung? Der Grund, warum wir Netzneutralität haben wollen, ist doch gerade weil wir so ein zweigleisiges Modell vermeiden wollen, bei dem die Reichen gutes Internet haben und beim Rest ruckelt Youtube. Insofern finde ich das akzeptabler, wenn es kein Premium-Angebot ohne Ruckeln gibt, denn auf der feinen Linie zwischen Qualitätsmaximierung und Profitmaximierung nimmt das Premiumangebot allen Zweifel, dass es um Letzteres geht.

Ich finde die Netzneutralitätsdebatte im Übrigen generell ziemlich verlogen. Erstens ist Traffic Shaping gut und wird von fast allen gemacht, ob sie es wissen oder nicht. Eure Plasterouter priorisieren wahrscheinlich Voip vor Downloads, wenn sie nicht noch aus dem letzten Jahrtausend sind. Und das will man ja auch so haben, weil Internet anders völlig unerträglich ist. Und dieses ""aber aber dann müssen die ja DPI machen und DPI ist böse!1!!"" ist auch verlogen, denn man kann das natürlich auch ohne DPI machen, indem man ein paar gute Ports whitelistet und den Rest shaped. Dann funktioniert es aber weniger gut und das ist am Ende im Sinne von niemandem, weder dem Kunden noch dem Provider. Wir als Kunden wollen, dass das Internet nicht ruckelt, und der Weg dahin heißt Traffic Shaping und QOS. Das kann man nicht einfach verbieten und gut ist.

Die einzige andere Möglichkeit ist, wenn man den Providern gesetzlich vorschreibt, dass sie die Bandbreite nicht überverkaufen dürfen. Könnte man drüber reden, aber überlegt euch mal, wie die Welt dann aussieht. Dann haben wir wieder 1 MBit Internetanbindungen. Und um Anfeindungen wegen Netzneutralitätsverletzung aus dem Wege zu gehen würden die Provider dann immer noch shapen, aber halt in die andere Richtung — keiner darf dann mehr gutes Internet kriegen, wenn Kapazitäten frei sind, sondern dann muss das auch für den einzigen aktiven Teilnehmer schmerzen und ruckeln.

Fakt ist: 32 MBit Internet zuhause ist nicht real. Das geht nur, wenn man mehr Bandbreite verkauft als man hat. Und das ist ja nicht nur bei Internet üblich, sondern auch bei Flugzeugen und der Bahn. Und wenn dann mehr Leute zugfahren als Sitzplätze da sind, dann müssen die eben stehen, und beim Flugzeug können die dann halt nicht mitfliegen und die Fluglinie hat ein Problem und muss Gutscheine verteilen. Auch unsere Straßen und das Telefonnetz sind nicht darauf ausgelegt, dass sie alle zur gleichen Zeit benutzen. Denen verbietet das ja auch keiner. Von Banken mal ganz zu schweigen, die verleihen ja auch mehr Geld als sie Einlagen haben.

Ich glaube daher, Netzneutralität ist die falsche Baustelle. Das wirkliche Problem ist, wenn Provider ihre Netze nicht ausbauen. Da kann man aus meiner Sicht Kabel Deutschland gerade vergleichsweise wenig Vorwürfe machen. Mein Vorschlag wäre daher, nicht die Netzneutralität festzuschreiben, sondern andersherum:

    Hinnehmen, dass Traffic Shaping Realität ist. So funktioniert unsere Infrastruktur. Da führt kein Weg dran vorbei.
    Verbieten, dass Provider im Durchschnitt über die tatsächlich angefragten Ressourcen deutlich weniger Traffic liefern als als Maximaltraffic beworben wurde. Oversubscribing ist OK, solange der Kunde es nicht merkt. Man muss die Provider halt zwingen, bei Überfüllung zügig das Netz auszubauen. Ich habe im Moment keinen Grund für Beschwerde bei Kabel Deutschland an der Front.
    Verbieten, dass Provider eine Zwei-Klassen-Internet einführen, wo wer mehr zahlt weniger Shaping pro Nominalbandbreite kriegt.

Ich persönlich finde auch das Shaping tagsüber auf die Hälfte im Grunde auch akzeptabel. Das ist der Preis, den ich dafür zahle, dass ich für 30 Euro dickes Internet kriege. Aber man kann auch das Gegenteil argumentieren: Sollen sie lieber mehr Bandbreite ranschaffen und die Kosten auf die Kunden umlegen. Wem das zu teuer ist, der kann ja zum alten Preis das halbe Internet nehmen. Was wir eigentlich erreichen wollen ist ja, dass die Leute sich grob auf die Bandbreitenangaben ihres Providers verlassen können.

Update: Das sollte jetzt kein Manifest zur Netzneutralität werden, sondern nur ein paar Details zum Shaping ansprechen. Die eigentliche Netzneutralitätsverletzung kommt, wenn Rapidshare zu KDG geht und fragt, wieviel Geld sie auf den Tisch legen müssen, damit sie höher als Mediafire priorisiert werden, und KDG dann eine Zahl sagt. Auf der anderen Seite würde niemand was sagen, wenn Rapidshare bei KDG im Rechenzentrum Platz anmietet und dort ihre Server hinstellt. So einfach ist die Situation eben nicht, dass man das mal eben übers Knie brechen kann.

Dann kommt hier noch der Einwand, dass Netzneutralität nicht um Shaping nach Trafficsünderei geht sondern um Diskriminierung von Diensten. Wer Lesen kann ist klar im Vorteil:

I think the historic seperation might have even hindered growth and the development of a very different culture.

Berlin was a city with a stalled development and never became a metropolis like London or Paris.

That is beginning to change and Berlin gains traction, especially with low rents and all sorts of bohemian people and artists moving in. At the moment, Berlin is probably a more interesting place to be than other european capitals because it is catching up and evolving at an enormous speed.

Let me just signal the following parts:


&gt; Como posso obter o CESD?

&gt;**Através da Segurança Social ou do seu subsistema de saúde.**

&gt;Na Internet

&gt;**Beneficiários da Segurança Social**, com número de identificação da segurança social (NISS), o CESD pode ser pedido na página da Internet em http://www.seg-social.pt/, através da Segurança Social Directa (terá de fazer previamente o registo caso ainda não o tenha feito e aguardar que lhe seja enviada a senha de acesso para a morada que indicar).

&gt;Por telefone

&gt;**Beneficiários com número de identificação da segurança social (NISS) e residentes em Portugal** podem pedir o CESD por telefone, contactando o serviço Via Segurança Social:

&gt;Em Portugal ligue 808 266 266

&gt;Do estrangeiro ligue 00351 272 345 313

&gt;Após autenticação dos dados relativos a quem faz o pedido, poderá pedir que lhe seja emitido cartão.

&gt;Presencialmente

&gt;Em Portugal Continental

&gt;Nos serviços da Segurança Social da área de residência dos beneficiários inscritos na Segurança Social, podendo preencher o formulário Modelo GIT53-DGSS (PDF - 65 Kb), disponível em http://www.seg-social.pt/, na opção Formulários&gt; seleccionando a categoria&gt; Cartão Europeu de Seguro de Doença, juntando cópia de um dos seguintes documentos:

&gt; - **Cartão de identificação da Segurança Social ou documento onde conste o número de beneficiário**

&gt; - **Cartão de beneficiário de subsistema público ou particular**

&gt; - **Cartão de utente do Serviço Nacional de Saúde (SNS).**

&gt;Nas caixas de previdência

&gt;Nas Lojas do Cidadão

&gt;Junto do subsistema de saúde público (ADSE, SSMJ, etc.) ou particular.

And:

&gt;Quem pode ser titular do CESD?

&gt;O Cartão Europeu de Seguro de Doença destina-se aos cidadãos dos 27 Estados-Membros da União Europeia, bem como da Islândia, Liechtenstein, Noruega e Suíça.

&gt;O CESD é nominativo e individual. Os seus titulares podem ser:

&gt;**Trabalhadores, inclusive os dos transportes internacionais, os estudantes, os pensionistas e seus familiares que se encontrem abrangidos por um regime de segurança social; 
Beneficiários de subsistemas de protecção social que tenham assumido a responsabilidade pelos encargos financeiros gerados com os cuidados de saúde prestados aos titulares do CESD;
Utentes do Serviço Nacional de Saúde no caso de não haver vínculo à segurança social ou a um subsistema de saúde.**
Uma vez que o cartão é individual, cada membro da família da pessoa segurada deve ter o seu cartão.

TL;DR - You need to have a social security number (more information [here](http://www2.seg-social.pt/ingles/)) or to have an SNS (portuguese NHS) usercard. To have either you need to be one of the following:

- Born and **living** in Portugal
- Legalized worker in Portugal
- Legalized resident of Portugal
- Be part of the family of one of the above (means fiscally dependent family, if you deliver taxes on your own, you can't enjoy these benefits)

true,roflburger,UNSA,United States,"I think the EUs best chance is a strategic breakup at this point. 

After that Germany can lead a new EU with much more stringent financial and budget control and institutions with some teeth. Maybe a unified military as well. After making a workable eu state other countries can be admitted. This would likely start off with a few northern European states. I think they would be very successful an willing to enact the reforms necessary to have a robust union. 

As time goes on other members can be admitted but since they are joining the EU as is and past the period of forming the rules their choice will be a binary yes or no rather than a bureaucratic mess like it is now. They will see the success of the bloc and join rather than being dominated by their eu neighbors. 

Tho would give the EU a chance to show potential members that it is a success and a trustworthy government and it will protect member states as the entry requirements would include a lot of good reforms and ceding sovereignty to a federal government. And since the nation have to vote to get in it is not a case of simply changing the eu's scope in undemocratically  after the fact. 

In sum it is so much easier to start with a small union and perfect it while adding other states a efficiency is improved and precedent made. The mistakes will be less pronounced with a smaller and more economically similar base and after years of this the system should be stable and beneficial enough to attract other European members through referendum. In fact it will even bring unity if an overarching national effort is put into making themselves ready to join the EU an the prestige and riches that comes with.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"Capital of Federated Europe would be a big place that would bring a considerable economic boost to the generic region where it is located (on the magnitude of a five hundred kilometres to any direction, I would say, perhaps more if located next to sea). When choosing the location, one should keep in mind that; 

1. Most current cities were originally built to organise trade between farms (the other alternative is harbour-cities), and are such in the middle of the most fertile ground on the area. As the  cities grow, they consume land that is the best on the region. It would be better if the land/town/city chosen as the new capital would be such that some resource or advantage would not have to be removed for the capital area to thrive (for one extremely blunt example - if the capital was next to the best natural resources area in the world, it would still be left unexploited while less good natural resources would be dug out elsewhere). 

2. The capital should be at a place that is easily accessible from all governed areas. While this is less important today than it was before air travel became common, the capital would still end up being the middle of an infrastructure network of railways, roads and yes, even air travel. To ensure that all areas of would be best served by the new capital, it should be located such that the spider-web of infrastructure wouldn't be ""off-balance"". For example, currently the European railway-system is centered on Paris, which causes quite the turns if you are trying to get from nearly any location to anywhere else using trains. 

3. On the risk of repeating myself, the area should be, if not uninhabited, at least habited by very few people before hand (because areas with few resources or farms will probably not have a lot of work to do, either); also that no previous special cultural identity would be disturbed.

4. The capital should have space to grow. This means it should not be located on an island nor next to culturally important ruins.  

5. The new capital can even be located in a hard-to-build area, as money will not be a problem for any place chosen as the capital of a place like Europe.

6. The area chosen should probably have to be a special area and not part of any nation; similarly as Washington DC was removed the then sovereign states of Maryland and Virginia. Thus it should perhaps not be in the middle of any current state, so as to not make it a ""donut"". 

For these reasons, I would probably suggest some of these places;


- **Western Coast of the continental Denmark**; virtually uninhabited as it is; no natural resources and land is too sandy for farming. Easy to access from both North and from South, as well as from West and East. Building here would make the roads in balanced fashion to pretty much every place in Europe, without scewing to one side or another. Easy enough place to built to. It's pretty ""in the middle"" geographically. As a minus, if glaciers melt, it will be the first place to go. 

- **Some backward place in the Alps, perhaps at the border of Austria**. Again, somewhat ""middle"", low population density, building would be hard but this would give the capital an identity unlike any other. Infrastructure would be greatly improved on the area. If glaciers melt, it will probably still be over water.

Anyone who have been in ""lycée"" and have ""le bac"" speak a bit english. Sometimes they nail it. Paris is very touristic so with english and crappy french you'll do just fine !

Maybe you want to book some place to stay for 15 days or so, maybe an airbnb.

Also, I don't know if you know the usual way on renting on Spain. People feels very insecure while renting, due to the crysis, and inmigrants or whatever, and will usually try to get 2 or 3 months of ""insurance deposit"" if you don't have a bank warantee, which probably will be difficult to get as you are just arriving to spain. And if you do it through a real state agency they will get a month of rent as a commision (non refundable, of course).

If you write some sort of standard answer to the renting ads, I can translate it to very-correct spanish for you, and, I still don't know if I'll be around from 15th to 20th, but, if you set some appointments on the same morning/afternoon when I'm around, I can maybe go with you and help a bit.

No, it's just a simplistic narrative that is popular on places like ThinkProgress and /r/politics. It has little to do with reality. There has certainly been a lot of gridlock, but it's not just ""because they can"". It's a lot to do with the types of bills being put up, Republicans feeling shut out of the process(they are typically not allowed to introduce amendments or bills), the use of procedural tactics to slide bills through and prevent Republican influence from reaching the bills, and a competing view on the effect of government spending as a way to revitalize the economy -  the basis for recurring conflict over the past several years.

There *is* some brinksmanship and gridlock for it's own sake, bit it runs a lot deeper than that. It's not a system currently well geared for compromise by either side.

&gt;Also, Democrats only had control over the house for 2 years. 

They had a supermajority during that time and also had control over the Senate(which they still do). They were just unable to get their own party to agree with their bills frequently enough to evade Republican filibusters.

But ofcourse, what I meant with ""centrally located"" is that it's more or less in the centre of the EU and easily accessible.

You don't see regions within England asking for a Parliament much in the same way you don't see Scotland protesting for more powers. There is as much difference between Northumbria and the Home Counties as there is Edinburgh and London. Yet only one has an issue. I would argue it is largely to do with the SNP representation being slightly power hungry and jingoistic... but that is a different issue.

The UK's foreign policy stance towards the USA is largely a result of the sharing of interests. The UK is a very internationally oriented country with many diverse interests around the world to a level completely different to the rest of the EU. This often makes it incompatible. It also means, yes, we go to great pains to push the USA in a direction which is advantageous to us - a stance which of course has its costs. Once that balance changes, so will the UK's orientation. As it has done over the past 200 years and will continue to do so. We are close allies because it is in our interests to be, and no other reason. Culture and history have very little to do with it although it certainly plays its part.

I can understand an independent Scotland wishing to distance itself from the costs of this foreign policy. However it must be understood, that in such a situation it is much less capable of defending itself from the disadvantages, too. The world is heading towards the realm of superstates. We are, of course, in the EU and as members of the Anglosphere also closely tied with the US, AUS, NZ, etc. It should be about how we can merge these interests to better protect the ideals of the EU and UK in this environment, and change the EU together to make it better for the whole, than stamping our feet in the ground and fragmenting, benefiting nobody.",0,1344884377,null,0,false,0,c5sjzdu,t3_y593r,t1_c5sjzdu,t1_c5sj5ou,null,1429628230,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

A capital for Europe shouldn't be ruling and leading, it should be receiving and acting as a meeting place rather than a place of power.

As for problems with making coalition governments in Belgium: the latest trouble was caused by needing to assemble a coalition to change the constitution, so that required 2/3 majorities.
Belgian government is like a boot camp for coalition building. There are four regional and community governments, and a federal one. Each one of those are constitutionally on the same level, so it's not like the federal level bullies everyone in line when they have a coalition. These all have their separate elections, there are different electoral tendencies in Flanders and Wallonia, and that whole knot is tied together in Brussels where both the federal and regional Brussels governments are composed out of Dutch speaking as well as French speaking parties. In other words, a six-party coalition crossing ethnic boundaries with asymmetric political parties is just business as usual in Belgium...

&gt; de 21h à Minuit.

Soit une heure, en temps Sylvanesque.

&gt; Proposer une activité

Pas vu. La vidéo de Bardaf propose plein d'activités amusantes à la fin, ça s'est passé après ?

&gt; Cadavre exquis

Pas vu non plus. J'en ai un pour Sylvain : Examen sanguin. (promis c'est tombé au pif, un mot a été choisi par mon hémisphère gauche et l'autre par l'hémisphère droit)

&gt; Karaoké

Toujours pas, j'aurais adoré écouter le joli brin de voix de Sylvain entonner visage tisonnier de Dame Gaga.

&gt; Dessiner un mot ou une expression

Décidément, le programme n'est pas suivi à la lettre.

8==D (_ o _)

C'est une expression qu'il faut trouver, elle désigne ce qu'ont subi ceux qui sont venus à la soirée.

&gt; Jeux

Le vrai jeu c'est de réussir à rester sérieux et ne pas s'endormir.

&gt; Extraits de films

Heureusement qu'il n'y en a pas eu, vu que la soirée est publique et payante, Sylvain devrait rétribuer les gentils producteurs des films qu'il diffuserait.

&gt; Tarif libre en sortie

Gains de la soirée : Un bon pour un bisou, un bouton de chemise, deux élastiques et un centime d'€uro qui était déjà dans la poche de Sylvain.

Comment peut-on demander aux gens de payer pour un truc comme ça ? Ca n'est même pas pareil que ce qui est annoncé !

&gt;This produced an interesting result:

&gt;* ECB interest rates were too high for Germany, but too low for many other eurozone countries.

&gt; * But in a bid to help the eurozone's largest economy, rates were lowered from 4.75% in 2001 to 2% (then a postwar low) in 2003, exacerbating the problems in the periphery.

&gt; * Germany couldn't reflate via fiscal policy due to the constraints of the Stability Pact (which limits budget deficits to 3% of GDP).

&gt; * Other countries had to ""rescue"" Germany by expansionary policies.

&gt;Well, we all know what the result of that was.

this being said, i somewhat disagree with the, for lack of better word, ""catastrophiste"" assessments i hear all over the place, that claim that PSG has ""lost it's soul"" or that the parc is ""dead"". true, it's not the same. it's not as loud or intense or crazy. but there are true supporters there and the parc is still beautiful and many of the old crowd are still there. also, there are new fans, who are no longer afraid of going to games. just because they haven't been fans for 30 years doesn't mean they can't support the team, and care just as much. organization in auteuil and boulogne is missing, but there are still some solid échanges auteuil boulogne and oh ville lumière and whatnot.

If Scotland becomes independent, it will have to reapply. There is no automatic membership. Every new state to join the Union has to go through the application process.

If you think about it, this does make a lot of sense. If a dodgy part of Ukraine proclaimed itself independent through a mini military coup, would we want it to be automatically in the EU? I am sure any new state emerging out of a memberstate will be very welcome to apply, but it will have to meet the EU's values and economic standards. That is why every new member state needs to be evaluated on its own.

Also, Scotland did not ""meet the conditions"" as such - there has not been an independent evaluation of Scotland on its own through the EU. Memberstates meeting the conditions does not mean all of their respective parts do so, too. I am pretty sure an independent Republic of Sicily would most certainly not and would be denied membership. Even some parts of the East of Germany probably wouldn't be allowed to joint on their own.

Unlike others here I do think Scotland would be allowed to join eventually - if enough influential states throw their weight behind it, Spain will not be able to object. It will have to go through the application process, though, which also entails adopting the euro.

Also, the Affordable Care Act (""Obamacare"") was an incredibly significant piece of legislation.  I don't recall Bush passing anything similar; his equivalently-radical attempt at institutional reform, the privatization of Social Security, failed miserably.

Finally, the Republicans naturally have an easier time with the voters by appealing to irrational populism.

Freiburg is really nice too, I have visited it and really enjoyed it.

But if you want to visit a town, I have to recommend my hometome **Bamberg** in northern Bavaria:
* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique german medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  
*The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.
*Right next to the Cathedral, there is the ""Alte Hofhaltung"" where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers
*The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""
* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above 
* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006.
* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;hl=de&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=18)  as you'll have a superb view over Bamberg and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food. 
*Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;num=30&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=de&amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;t=h&amp;z=17)
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right and enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg

Also the area east of Bamberg [**""franconian swizerland""**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A4nkische_Schweiz Bamberg) is the one with highest density of breweries in the world, if you are into good beer and nice landscape, this is for you. There you have great hikes, you can climb on world-class rocks or visit a ton of castles in romantic valleys.

true,DisregardMyPants,UNSA,United States,"&gt;Not at all: many Democrats will vote with Republicans, but the reverse is not true, and Joseph Lieberman prevented Obama from having a super-majority (60 votes) in the Senate.

The Republicans have voted with the Democrats many times...just not on Obama's pet bills. Of course they're not going to vote for stimulus packages or jobs bills that are heavy on the idea of using the government as means of stimulus.

[Here is 2011-2012 alone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_the_112th_United_States_Congress). The Democrats cannot pass anything without the Republicans because of the house, and you will notice that many things have passed. That's not even including the things that had some support from both parties but failed, or the things earlier in his term.

&gt;Also, the Affordable Care Act (""Obamacare"") was an incredibly significant piece of legislation. I don't recall Bush passing anything similar; his equivalently-radical attempt at institutional reform, the privatization of Social Security, failed miserably.

Well, the Democrats went weak in the knees and supported most of the things that *should* have been every bit as controversial as Obamacare.

&gt;Finally, the Republicans naturally have an easier time with the voters by appealing to irrational populism. Understanding why Democratic proposals make sense requires a bit of thought and therefore it's a harder sell. For example, the average man can easily understand that more taxes = less money for him to spend. Can he understand the savings caused by the ACA's regulation of health insurance in the same intuitive, simple way? Nope.

It's a lot easier to break down opponents when you're arguing against strawmen. People had a variety of different reasons for not supporting the ACA. Some were legitimate, some were not.

Edit: [Here are the acts that passed both houses and got signed in 2009-2011](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_the_111th_United_States_Congress). Some of those tread into supermajority territory, but many also required Republican support.

Also, if your resentment towards Westminster is indeed not nationally motivated, I do think that sooner or later you will feel equally disillusioned about Holyrood as you do now about Westminster. The SNP is probably the best party to be in government in Scotland right now (simply because all promising Scottish politicians of the other parties have gone to Westminster rather than Edinburgh), but they are flip-floppers like every other party too. This is not supposed to be politician-bashing, which I think is generally unfair and ignorant, but Westminster is pretty much just a parliament like any other. Before the recession, the SNP wanted to make Scotland a neoliberal woderland like Ireland. Now that that's not particularly popular anymore, they're suddenly a social-democratic party and liken Scotland to Scandinavia. Long story short, the politics (NB not policies, which would be different indeed) of an independent Scotland will not differ much from the Westminster that  you (probably legitimately) hate so much.

But it is really repetitive, so much to the point that it becomes not fun when you get a little further in (at least to me). Also, I never got the grasp of the 'rules' of German... and it drove me crazy. 

Duolingo on the other hand seemed to help a lot more with learning the rules, which I personally like to know. And it has a small community built in that can provide extra insight and answer other questions you might have. 

If you are going to torrent Rosetta stone, I'd say give both of them a shot (maybe even at the same time). If were thinking about getting a legit copy, I'd say just start with Duolingo first and see how much more you want/need to learn after that.

Some of the quirks specific to mobile service in France:

- Your provider will normally give you a choice between a ""normal"" plan/forfait and a ""forfait bloqué"". The forfait bloqué means that your plan is set at a certain number of minutes/texts per month and absolutely cannot exceed that number, hence your bill each month is roughly the same. Non-bloqué plans allow you to use more minutes/texts than are included in the price of your plan, but you will be charged for the extra minutes/texts.

- Data plans can be... odd. Your provider might give you a choice of ""internet"" (full 3G/4G) or ""mail"" (you can use your phone to check/manage your email but do not otherwise have continuous 3G/4G access).

- Picture messaging isn't necessarily included in texting plans, so make sure your plan specifically says ""SMS/MMS"" instead of just ""SMS"".

Well, I do think there is a valid argument that widespread ownership of firearms probably discourages burglaries.

The people who want to openly carry guns say that they'd rather deter crime by showing their weapon than have to pull the weapon in the heat of the moment.  They think that criminals won't mess with them if they have a gun...and that makes sense to me.

However, I don't support open carry, because I think that people would use their guns to intimidate innocent people, even if it happened unintentionally.  Imagine getting into a car accident with a guy who has a gun on his belt, for example.

In each of those examples, you had the weapon for a non-violent purpose.  Are Europeans allowed to bear weapons for the purpose of killing other people who are threatening them with violence?  

There are a lot of tragedies in the US because of this practice.

There are also some Internet banks like DiBa, which have no physical branches at all. In return, you get a free credit card (Visa) and a relatively high interest (in your favor) on your checking account. And most ATMs take Visa, so you'd get the highest ATM density here.

Anyway, the first couple of results from Google scholar on ""Weapons aggression""

&gt; [TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT STIMULI COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH AGGRESSION CAN ELICIT AGGRESSIIVE RESPONSES FROM PEOPLE READY TO ACT AGGRESSIVELY. 100 MALE UNIVERSITY SS RECEIVED EITHER 1 OR 7 SHOCKS, SUPPOSEDLY FROM A PEER, AND WERE THEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOCK THIS PERSON. IN SOME CASES A RIFLE AND REVOLVER WERE NEAR THE SHOCK KEY. THESE WEAPONS WERE SAID TO BELONG, OR NOT TO BELONG, TO THE AVAILABLE TARGET PERSON. IN OTHER INSTANCES THERE WAS NOTHING NEAR THE KEY, WHILE FOR CONTROLS 2 BADMINTON RACQUETS WERE NEAR THE KEY. THE GREATEST NUMBER OF SHOCKS WAS GIVEN BY THE STRONGLY AROUSED SS (WHO HAD RECEIVED 7 SHOCKS) WHEN THEY WERE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE WEAPONS. THE GUNS HAD EVIDENTLY ELICITED STRONG AGGRESSIVE RESPONSES FROM THE AROUSED MEN. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/7/2p1/202/)

People react more aggressively when weapons are at hand.

&gt; [Recent research (Anderson, Benjamin, &amp; Bartholow, 1998) indicates that the presence of guns increases the accessibility of aggressive thoughts via automatic priming. Our research examined whether this “weapons priming effect” differs depending on the structure of an individual's knowledge about guns, and if so, whether that difference results in corresponding differences in aggressive behavior. Experiment 1 revealed that individuals with prior gun experience (hunters) have more detailed and specific information about guns than do individuals with no direct gun experience (nonhunters), and that hunting experience interacts with gun type (hunting versus assault) in predicting affective and cognitive reactions to guns. Experiment 2 revealed that pictures of hunting guns were more likely to prime aggressive thoughts among nonhunters, whereas pictures of assault guns were more likely to prime aggressive thoughts among hunters. Experiment 3 showed differences in aggressive behavior following gun primes that correspond to differences in affective and cognitive responses to gun cues. Our findings are discussed in light of the General Aggression Model.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103104000587)

Both seasoned weapons-users, who use weapons as tools (hunters) and inept amateurs (non-hunters) are susceptible to this, within bounds (assault rifles elicit other responses than hunting rifles, in people who are used to hunting rifles)

&gt; [Evidence is presented suggesting that firearms violence is an important social problem. Research strongly suggests that the effectiveness of firearms as a cause of death and injury may be due to their widespread availability, their lethality, and the impulsivity of their use. The investigation of a possible causal link between firearms and impulsive aggression led to Berkowitz and LePage's (1967) weapons effect experiment. The results suggested that weapons can increase the instigation to aggression in aroused an uninhibited individuals. The researchers reasoned that weapons might stimulate aggression by classical conditioning processes resulting from learned associations between aggressive acts and weapons. Although a few studies have failed to reproduce an aggression-enhancing effect of weapons, the original finding has been replicated in several countries with diverse subject groups both in field and laboratory settings. However, these studies also indicate that many individuals may react with anxiety or fear in the presence of weapons and inhibit aggressive reactions. Manipulations of evaluation apprehension, subject suspiciousness, and/or hypothesis awareness about the purpose of the weapons in the experiments all seem to lead to reduced levels of aggressive response in the presence of weapons. These findings offer a possible explanation for the few failures to replicate the original weapons effect; if researchers used apprehensive subjects or subjects who were aware of possible experimental deceptions, they were more likely to observe an inhibitory reaction rather than an aggression-enhancing effect of weapons.]

true,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"Forbidden to wield are, in Germany:

1. Knives with a blade lockable with one hand
2. Non-folding knives longer than 12cm
3. Knives that are weapons in the sense of the WaffG, that is, daggers, swords, anything with a blood channel.
4. All forbidden knives (e.g. butterfly, all automatically opening ones). Those aren't merely forbidden to wield, but also to posses.

Everything else is allowed. As you're going for a Swiss one, make sure that it's not one-hand lockable and you're fine.

Your knife also becomes illegal the second you use it for something illegal. Police may confiscate knives if you use them for anything not ""socially adequate"". Think cutting an apple, opening a can, that kind of stuff.

Additional restrictions, to be precise against ""dangerous objects"", usually apply during demonstrations and similar. Yes, small, unlocking Swiss blades qualify, cut your apples at home.

There's also a difference between merely carrying and wielding, literally, ""leading"" a weapon/knife. A kitchen knife in your hand or at your belt on the street is a weapon, in your backpack it's a legal knife. Same thing applies for an axe and your backyard.

TBH, the whole legal situation is a mess. Just don't try to have one on you in an area where the police can reasonably expect violence and you're fine with everything Victorinox or Wenger sells, as long as it's not one-hand lockable.

Exactly, so then people are certainly right when they complain that they are giving away the money. 

&gt; I would see a debt write off in exchange for near total integration and subjugation, dressed up as federalization as the likely outcome. In fact, with the 'fiscal stability' treaty and the ESM, this has already begun.

But it is the northern countries that do not want mutual debt and write offs, since they would pay for it. So, the countries that are against it, are not being helped by mutualisation or debt right off.

I don't think that is working very well.........

&gt;Except the Greeks decided to throw their toys out of the pram, and risk bringing the whole plan down.

I don't believe that. The Greek government didn't take on a 160 % debt to throw off a conspiracy/secret plan.

The reason that the devolved parliaments in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff are taken seriously is that they can always push for further devolution, or even independence from the Union, if they don't like the way things are going.

Take the same precautions you would in a city in the states, don't walk home alone after dark, train stations (termini) are sketchy, so be accompanied there too.

There's no one carrying guns in Italy, so you won't get shot but someone along the line will probably try to pickpocket you. Don't let them do this.

Couchsurfing.org is a great resource to meet new people, I recommend getting involved with the Rome group.

Train tickets are easy to buy at the station, beware of trying to buy tickets at small country stations on Sundays, no one will be working there. Also train strikes suck, scan newspapers metro sections for the word sciopero if you are planning any trips.

Campo Di fiori, scholars, abbey theatre, and trinity college are the bars you can visit if you are looking for foreigners, but are expensive and the people there suck more often than not (bias). My favorite bar is bar San calisto in trastevere, near piazza Santa Maria. You will find lots of expats drinkin there and beers cost 2.50e

If the au pair thing doesn't work out for you there is a great site that posts English language jobs called www.wantedinrome.com

You must absolutely go to villa borghese to see berninis sculptures. Also get a ticket to enter Vatican at earliest possibility, walk all the way through the museum bypassing everything, and go to see Sistine chapel while the room is still empty. See the keyhole at the palace of the knights of Malta, observe the sunset from the gianicolo above roma, and for sure go watch a football match at the stadio olympico.

Weather will get rainy in oct and nov, so take advantage being outside, and keep in mind the best sales are going to come after January 6th, so save your shopping needs fOr that.

Persons with a disability travelling with Deutsche Bahn are entitled by law to some benefits as “compensation for disadvantages”. These are tied to certain conditions:

Requirements: disabled person’s ID card and token

Disabled persons are entitled to claim benefits if they have an official disabled person’s ID card issued in Germany, which is green with an orange imprint on half the page, and a supplement with a valid token or an additional personal route list.

The tokens are available from the authority which issues your disabled person’s ID card, together with your personal route list (“Versorgungsamt”). The tokens are valid for either one year or six months and currently cost 60 euros or 30 euros.

Disabled persons who are blind or helpless, who claim unemployment benefit or regular supplementary benefits pursuant to the German Social Security Act or equivalent war victim benefits are entitled to these tokens free of charge.""

Don't be a jackass (the [Ugly American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugly_American_\(pejorative\)) stereotype) and you'll have no problems at all.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"Finnish history during WW2 was rather special one. To explain it in the amount of time available (and to get the narrative to work) some alternations have been made. The basic version of *WW2 As Told In Finland* goes like this (relation to historic facts may be screwy; I intentionally didn't check wikipedia for this);

0. Versailles Peace Treaty is Unfair. Hitler Decides to do something about it, recreate German Empire. Adds Austria and Czech Republic to Germany.
1. Hitler and Stalin decide to share East Europe.

1b. Stalin wants us to give our fortifications on the East border to Russia, get some other land in return. Baltic countries got similar offers. We refuse, they didn't.

1c. Baltic countries just got invaded.

 2. Stalin attacks to Finland (just after Hitler attacked Poland, but nobody seems to mind about that; Britain and France just throw words but nothing happens). 

 3. Winter War. Soviet Union attacks after framing Finland for starting the war. WE KICK ASS but have to quit in the middle due to not having any ammo left. Tried to get ammo and weapons from Britain and France, but they were wiggling and all their talk about help was just pretext about invading Sweden. Fuckers.

4a. It's 1940 and peace is here again! Hussah! Even though we lost some of the best farmland and the second biggest city in the country. And the best port in the country. Fuckers.

4b. It looks like Britain and France finally started fighting Germany in the South. Oh well, no biggie. They do that every few years. 

5. Uh oh. It looks like Stalin is readying for round 2. Good thing that Hitler gave us all this ammo, few tanks and and even some soldiers to reinforce the borders at Lapland. For all his faults, he's pretty nice when he wants to.

6. Continuation War! We attack pre-emptively Soviet Union (they were threatening to attack as well and apparently they didn't like us cargoing German soldiers to Lapland; if we hadn't done it, they would have next week). We did so well last time without any proper weapons, so with the help of Germans, this should be a walk in the park. Lets get our territory back, and some extra while we're at it.

7. Few years later and things aren't going so well. Apparently Germany isn't doing that well in the South, either. Better sue for peace.

8. Germans are understandably angry about the peace.

9. Lapland War! Germans didn't like the backstab, so now we have to fight them out of Lapland. Which they had been busy reinforcing the past few years.

10. 1944 OK, we got the port back, but now the Soviets have a military base three kilometres outside the capital. We're fucked.

11. Apparently Germany lost the war. Idiots. Should have waited with operation Barbarosa till you got the Western Front subdued. And what was thing about involving Americans. Retards. 

12. 1948! Still independent! Things are looking up! The Soviet military brass leaves the country! All we had to do was sign this paper where we promise to fight Germany in WW3 and something about Soviet military restoring peace in case of rebellion. OK, perhaps we're still fucked.

13. 1948 - 1984 Yes massah USSR, no massah USSR, Finland be a good boy. 

14.  1984 - 1988 OK, our president-for-life went and died and apparently it's against the peace treaty to talk about anything without asking the Russians first. Better try to find a new president-for-life. Oh, and they're doing some rebelling down south. The tanks will be there soon, I'm sure. Better make sure they don't come here.

15. 1988 Estonia declared independence! Oh, those guys are gonna be fucked!

16. 1989 Where's the tanks?

17. 1991 Soviet Union fell. How the hell did that happen? Two months ago everything was going REALLY WELL.

Of course, there are some classes about how Germany did at the continent, but most of the time is obviously spent with Stalin being the bad guy, Hitler giving weapons when Britain and France being dicks over Sweden.  Gdansk has very little to do with any of that.

Sorry for the language, trying to let you know how things were viewed back then. Not my opinions etc.

Two halls are ""business area"" anyway. Nothing interesting there at all.
All the huge booths are huge boxes where you either wait in line for three hours and watch a trailer that's on youtube anyway, or wait for four hours and play a game for ten minutes.
Then there are the things where asshole moderators are shouting at the nerds to whore themselves out for the chance of getting a t-shirt thrown in their general direction.
And a lot of the booths are quite silly anyway. Some periphery manufacturer this year (it might be Roccat? Def. not Razer, they have hot babes this year) has a huge screen with like, and ad, trailer or something, where it looks like a mouse is getting manufactured in a cliché movie steel factory. It might look ""awesome"" and appealing to a 13 year old, but damn, that thing put me off hard. It's a fucking mouse. Stop trying to make it look badass..

Really, the parts worth going are maybe cool things like a lego orc from WoW Blizzard has at their booth this year. Two formula one cars are there too (and the Porsche and Dodge Challenger from NFS The Run last year were damn cool, too!). Also, merchandise, if that's your thing. And gaping your eyes out at the hostesses (*they* are damn hot this year, I can tell you that for a fact).
And, of course, you do get to see some of the games. I really like playing some of the lesser known games, where you don't have to wait in line much or at all. You really get to see some titles you normally wouldn't be interested in.

But that's it. I found it pretty cool the first time I went. But last year was disappointing, and this year doesn't look much different so far.",0,1344979329,null,0,false,0,c5t6a9h,t3_y79v0,t1_c5t6a9h,t1_c5t5wju,null,1429638956,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1
