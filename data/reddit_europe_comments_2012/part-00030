The actual religious sacrament is and always will, of course, entirely run by their own rules, but I expect that ultimately they will be required to perform the secular duties on a non-discriminatory basis.

&gt;""Dass selbst das teuerste in Deutschland erhältliche Streamingdienst-Abo nicht über 10 Euro pro Monat hinausgeht (...) ist letztendlich nur Ausdruck dafür, wieviel die meisten Hörer nach Meinung eben dieser Anbieter bereit sind allerhöchstens zu zahlen. Für (fast) alle Musik dieser Welt.""

&gt;Nur so ein Vergleich aus der Sicht eines durchschnittlichen Musikhörers: Die Rundfunkgebühr, die einem per Radio - zumindest ihrem Auftrag nach - ""(fast) alle Musik dieser Welt"" oder zumindest einen guten Querschnitt ins Haus bringen sollte, beträgt gegenwärtig 5,76 Euro pro Haushalt. Bei einigen (leider den wenigsten) öffentlich-rechtlichen Sendern kommt zum reinen Musiksenden noch erheblicher redaktioneller Aufwand für die Erstellung von Nachrichten, Features etc. hinzu. Nicht zu vergessen der administrative Mehraufwand, der durch die föderale Zersplitterung Deutschlands entsteht. Das alles dürfte Spotify nicht haben, womit dann theoretisch ein größerer Teil bei Künstlern und Verwertern landen könnte.

&gt;Sicher, man kann nie genug für Kultur ausgeben. Aber die Tatsache, dass bei der alten GEZ-Gebühr dem Mainstream zugewandte Radio-DJs ungefragt das Kleingeld vieler Leute auf wenige große Haufen einzelner Künstler und ihrer Verwerter schaufeln, macht es noch lange nicht zu einem beklagenswerten Zustand, wenn nun die Leute nach eigenem Gusto viele kleinste Häufchen für ihre präferierten Künstler machen.

&gt;So das Longtail-Märchen denn überhaupt eintritt. Denn es gibt ja immer noch das ausgefeilte Marketing &amp; Lobbying der Musikindustrie zur Förderung des schlechten, aber profitablen Geschmacks und Duodezländerfürsten, die gern in gut ausgestattete Staatssender hineinregieren, hierarchiefreiere Medienformen wie das Internet fürchten und mal eben die Zwangsgebühren für ihre Top-down-Sender um 212 Prozent erhöhen.

&gt;Mit der Verteilung von Kulturgut über Plattformen fällt eventuell ein Intermediär &amp; Gatekeeper weg. Das ist für Musikindustrie wie Staatsmedien gleichermaßen bedrohlich. Dennoch sollte man das nicht als von vornherein als billigere und damit schlechtere Lösung abtun.

true,opcans,null,null,"I think gimmesteak has pretty much summed up what my thoughts are on this. I've never been to one of these protests, but I am very much against capitalism if you ask me how I felt about the subject. For all criticisms against capitalism, all one has to do is look over to America. I seriously can not believe that over there people are arguing against government paid for insurance, arguing for the removal of social insurances and safety nets, etc, all in the name of the ""free market"" and ""personal responsibility."" And yet, I believe it, because every day our own government, and Western Europe in general, is moving more and more right, more towards the American model of doing things, and this **really** bothers me.

So basically, I am against capitalism because it creates an atmosphere where companies start to work for $$$ rather than for benefiting society. They stop caring about their customers, and more about their employers (stockholders and owners). Then they start using their money to influence politics and laws, and write laws to help to make money easier (see: America). Money is easier for them to make, so they make more money, and influence more politics, and this is a never ending circle. Sooner or later, the government loses the ability to regulate these companies anymore because 1) the companies own the government and 2) these companies become ""too big to fall"" (again, see: America).

It enables classes of citizens, richer and poorer. No I don't believe that money should be allocated to people by the government, but one's money should have be an influencing factor of what type of life they can have. This gap between the rich and poor are dividing, and more should be done, before it becomes so great like… America.

I want social inequality to become more equalized. Other things we can do IMO is to get rid of health insurance companies, but instead implement a single government owned company, like in England. Or if that's too much work, then they can instead just let us keep our own health insurance companies but send all the bills to the government so we don't have to pay for it. Also remove the option for rich people to buy better health insurance, because this is a complete bullshit.

Meine Freunde und ich wollen einige Filme ansehen (""sehen"", ""schauen"" und ""anschauen"" sind auch ok). Wir versuchen Deutsch zu lernen (""wollen Deutsch lernen"" ist wohl eleganter) und ich denke, Filme könnten dabei helfen. Wir haben die populärsten deutschen Filme bereits gesehen und jetzt wollen wir einige weniger populäre (or use ""bekannte"" to avoid the repetition) anschauen.  

Die Filme sind von einem deutschen Filmfestival, das in unserer Stadt abgehalten wurde (besser: ""veranstaltet wurde""). Es würde mich glücklich machen (besser: ""es würde mich freuen"") ihre Meinung zu hören welche die besten sind.

true,chemmkl,null,null,"Salamanca is the #1 destination in Spain for learning Spanish. The Spanish accent in Salamanca it's said to be very clear and among the ""best"" ones. It has the oldest university in Spain and has a vibrant international student scene. The weather is very cold in winter and very hot in Summer, and the city is not especially well connected (plane/train/bus wise). It is indeed a walking city and the university it's in the city center. The locals are not especially friendly (Castillian people are known in Spain for being dry, but they are probably still friendlier than the average Germans, hehe), and they don't have many world-class sights within day-trip distance (althought they have quite a few in the very city center; Plaza Mayor and not one but two cathedrals).

Malaga has the best climate in the Iberian peninsula by far, with over 300 sunny days per year and averaging 15º in January. Because of this it gets ~9 million tourists per year, mostly from the UK, Germany and Scandinavia, and has affordable/cheap direct flights to most of Europe. They don't stay in the city but go to the Costa del Sol (many coastal towns 15-60km around the city) looking for beaches and Golf. Malaga also has a 2h30min high-speed rail connection with Madrid. The city itself has not many interesting sights but it's very well connected with Granada (Alhambra), Córdoba (Mosque) and Seville. Those have world-class sights if you'd like to make some weekend or day trips.

The university of Malaga is quite young and is not known for being especially good in anything. The campus is somewhat outside of the city and served by really crowded buses, but most students live in the suburbs around the university.

The people in Malaga is known for being very open-minded (because of the huge amount of ""modern"" tourists from northen Europe) and friendly, and it's really easy to make new friends.

So my advice would be to go to Malaga if you're looking for a more typical Spanish experience (you won't have that many foreign students around and will have to hang out with Spaniards): tapas, beach, sun, friendly people, relaxed lifestyle, weekend trips, etc. Btw, the Spanish accent here is bad, but not horrible-bad (it depends if you hang out with people from inland villages or not).

And go to Salamanca if Academia is more important to you, or you prefer to hang out with other international students or if you don't speak Spanish particularly well.",0,1331897949,null,0,true,0,c41mnfq,t3_qz7c8,t1_c41mnfq,t3_qz7c8,null,1428536111,13,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,13

*Almanya* ist sehr beliebt in Deutschland, ich fand ihn okay aber nicht besonders gut. Nichts zum mehrmals anschauen, für einmal aber sicher in Ordnung.

*Halt auf freier Strecke* ist eine interessante Idee und sicherlich auch eine gute Art Therapie für den Regisseur - diese Art Film gefällt mir persönlich allerdings gar nicht, ich muss keinem (wenn auch geschauspielerten) Krebspatienten beim langsamen Sterben zuschauen, schon gar nicht im Kino. Die Schauspieler in dem Film sind aber sehr gut.

*Schlafkrankheit* ist nicht besonders gut geeignet um Deutsch zu lernen. Er hat nur einige Sequenzen in Deutsch, der größte Teil ist in Französisch. Schau den [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQwdRgd4aJk) an, genau so ist der ganze Film.

*Wer wenn nicht wir?* ist ganz okay, aber auch nicht großartig. Wenn das Thema (Terrorismus in Deutschland in den 1970er Jahren) interessant ist, empfehle ich den besseren *Baader Meinhof Komplex*.

Einige weitere gute Vorschläge bietet [diese Liste](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_bedeutender_deutscher_Filme), hier sind bedeutende und weltweit ausgezeichnete Filme aus Deutschland aufgelistet.

Einige der meiner Meinung nach besten deutschen Filme: *Das weisse Band*, *Knockin' on Heaven's Door*, *Vincent will meer*, *Muxmäuschenstill*, *Lammbock*, *Das Boot*, *Das Leben der Anderen*, *Der Untergang*...

Ok this is basically the way most people view it, based off what is taught in school:

So at the end of WW1 there was the treaty of Lvov', and the formation of the German Ober Ost (I think). Russia ceded a lot of land to Germany, because they knew the Germans couldn't hold it. After the division of Poland, it was only natural that Russia regain the rest of their empire. That justification explains why Russia invaded Finland too. 

So the Baltics weren't really regarded as independent states.... regardless of what they themselves thought. And as far as I know Britain, France, and the USA also did not think of them as independent? In any case the other 3 anti-fascist powers did not do much to stop their annexation, nor the invasion of Finland later on. 

Remember as far as the USSR in the 40's was concerned, not being communist = being fascist. So it was either they would unite the Baltics with fellow communists, or they would liberate the Baltics from fascists. 

Although on a side note, every tsar of Russia since Peter the Great was German. They employed large amounts of Baltic Germans in high places of government, because their educational system (promoted by the Lutheran influence in the area) was far superior to the Russian version. From what I understand many Baltic people felt a connection to the throne, but not to the land. The Russians felt betrayed by this.

Tony Blair was only able to take the UK to war because of the evidence of WMD. The decision solely laid on that one fact. There was discussions with the Attorney General for weeks over whether or not it was legal for us to go and the decision was made that it was purely because of the existence of WMDs which meant it had breached the UN resolution on disarmament. 

Parliament did not want to be involved but were persuaded by the evidence supplied by the US about the presence of WMD. Had that evidence not existed we would not have gone because there was no legal justification for it.

When the Soviet Union was formed following the revolution of 1917, it soon declared the right to self-determination for the Peoples of Russia, upon which Finland promptly seceded.

With this in mind, how is the Winter War justified in any moral sense in today's Russia (assuming that it is justified at all)?

Bonjour ma nouvelle famille.

Je suis impatient de vous rencontrer. Je n'ai jamais été en France et je suis très heureux d'en avoir l'occasion. J'ai vingt ans, j'aime jouer du violoncelle et aime la musique en général. J'aime aussi jouer à la crosse. J'aime aussi les autres sports, mais n'y joue pas aussi souvent.

Quel genre d'activités aimez-vous faire avec votre famille? J'aime aller au cinéma, aller chez mes amis, lire des livres et la natation.

Je serai heureux de vous rencontrer l'automne prochain et vous souhaite bonne chance jusque-là.

Sincèrement, 
Kelly.


Now for a few remarks; Don't be afraid to use longer sentences, especially in written language. French people are kinda unlikely to know crosse, maybe you may include a very short note.
What about 'bonne chance'? That sounds like they're going through bad times, and if they're not that's a very odd thing to say.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Eurobonds would probably have ended the acute part of the crisis right away, but then the underlying problems would remain unsolved. 

(I already went into the differences between Greece as one and Ireland as the other end of the spectrum, what I'm writing about here is about the Greek end of it.)

Greece needs reforms. I think this is something we all agree on. Greece's problem isn't that it spends too much per se, it's that it does so in a very inefficient manner, and that it lacks the administrative ability to raise the necessary funds domestically. Denmark, for example, has a much higher share of government spending relative to GDP than Greece, and it works just fine -- that's because tax evasion is much less of a problem in Denmark, and because tax payers actually see a return.  

The measures required to address this are politically difficult. See [here](http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/04/28/greece-waste-idUSLDE63R0QZ20100428) for some examples of interest groups that you'd lose if you were to propose saving measures. It's 2012, unmarried daughters don't need their dead fathers' pensions. This kind of stuff means that businesses have to pay unnecessary taxes without getting things like good infrastructure in return, their employees have to pay additional taxes that go out of their salary and therefore drive up salary cost for their employers up additionally, and they can buy less with it because those same wasted tax euros make everything they pay for more expensive. Apart from this legal waste, there's the corruption and nepotism, which means that government contracts don't go to companies that complete them efficiently, but to those with good connections or those that simply pay a better bribe. Again, wasted money that would have better been spent on infrastructure and education.  
This needs to be addressed, but it hasn't been so far, and there's no reason to believe it would be in the future if the money that makes it possible to delay action further and let the problem become even worse was simply made available. Instead, those costs would effectively be exported -- it wouldn't be just Greece's problem anymore, but Europe's, and it would incentivize excessive spending and disincentivize reforms in other countries. That Greece could borrow money at effectively German interest rates is what lead to the crisis, how would formalizing the backing of their spending by the rest of Europe prevent it from happening again?  
With the status quo, that is without a framework that gives Brussels a means to influence national budgets, Eurobonds would be subject to the [Tragedy of the Commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). This, together with the notion that ordinary people there would have to pay the taxes that Greece's upper class evades, would make the very idea of the EU very unpopular in the countries that would eventually have to pay for it, and we've already seen this e.g., with the success of the True Finns.  
Put differently, you don't hand people blank checks, especially not if they have shown themselves to be financially irresponsible in the past. 

We need a fiscal union, and the nation states will have to give up some sovereignty over budgetary decisions for that. This union can include Eurobonds or transfer payments, but there must be measures to prevent excessive waste in individual countries that would lead to increased costs for all, *especially* when measures like Eurobonds would remove higher interest rates or even default as an incentive to address those problems.  

Yes, we need to spend to build up an viable economy in Greece, we need to support Spain in growing economic sectors that can replace construction as a provider of jobs, and we need to improve the standard of living in countries like Bulgaria or Romania. But to do this in a way that is politically realistic, and that ensures that this money is pent efficiently, we need to create a proper framework first. If we succeed in doing this, we'll all be much better off. ",0,1331926965,null,0,false,0,c41rczo,t3_qwmed,t1_c41rczo,t1_c41ofcx,null,1428538459,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

The T! The O! The P! The F!

I recommend ['Grosses Kino' und 'Eins A'](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blumentopf_%28Band%29#Diskografie)

Also not bad: [Eins Zwo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcR3VuKHA90&amp;feature=related)

One of the really great german singers is [Herbert Grönemeyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Gr%C3%B6nemeyer) - you can find lots of old gems in his discography, but may also want to check out his acclaimed 2002 album [Mensch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch_%28album%29). [Here is the single for your convenience](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xi8xn3_herbert-gronemeyer-mensch_music) - not on youtube, so it can't be blocked.

[Wolfsheim - es gibt kein weg zurück](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x14cz2_wolfsheim-kein-zuruck_music) - great song, I know little about the band.

[Einstürzende Neubauten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einst%C3%BCrzende_Neubauten) are somewhat wellknown musical pioneers, which you might like. You might have heard of them, as [Blixa Bargeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blixa_Bargeld) is well known for his work with Nick Cave and the bad seeds. 

[Ton Steine Scherben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton_Steine_Scherben) and the later solo projects of lead singer [Rio Reiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Reiser) are all worth listening to. Fair warning for touchy US citizens: TSS are/were very political and left wing to boot. Still, great music all around (often quite blues-y) and great lyrics; Rio Reiser is well known for his amazing ballads (something which is very hard to pull off well in german), check them out at least. [TSS sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UlTvJ2POXM) and [Rio Reiser sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VrzFwVdhrU) (audio only).

For more german hiphop I present you with [Kinderzimmer Productions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIvMszoTAGI).

Try german dancehall: nosliw, benjie, mono und nikitaman, lazy youth uvm.

I'm sure you know about [Seeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yWU0lFghxU&amp;feature=relmfu)?

Someone else already mentioned [Selig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeEoirfui8c) and I'm running out of ideas now (at least for people that I actually like)...

First of all, it's not necessarily the case that the EU is handling the crisis badly. Because to evaluate their success, you have to first consider the question: success according to what? Their strategy has successfully bailed out the banks so far, which was their goal. The problem is that this was their goal in their first place. 

We're not arguing against them. They know the effects of what they're doing. Countless studies have shown conclusively that austerity doesn't work. It didn't work for African countries during the Third World debt crisis, it didn't work for Argentina, it doesn't work for us. But they don't care that it 'didn't work', because all they wanted was to minimize their losses - at any social cost. It worked *for them* enough.

&gt; A closer look at Germany's economic experience for most of its eurozone membership reveals that only trade surpluses were keeping Germany from economic collapse. Half of Germany's dismal economic growth of just 1.7% on average between 1999 and 2007 – the second lowest in the eurozone – was driven by trade surpluses. Those are, by definition, the deficits of someone else.

&gt;Far from being a growth engine, the reforms of the 2000s depressed German internal demand and thus imports, much the same as they do in Greece nowadays. They also depressed German loan demand and squeezed bank profits. At the time, the southern economies were the perfect solution for Germany's self-inflicted economic problems. German banks could expand their business by lending them the money to purchase the goods that Germans could no longer afford themselves. Manufacturers and banks were happy. Germany's beggar-thy-neighbour policies only worked because others pursued the exact opposite policies.

&gt;This is why the eurozone-wide adoption of austerity cannot work. Greek demand for German goods is small, but Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese and Irish imports amounts to a large share of German exports.

Ca ne marche pas comme ça. Les revenus ne sont pas taxés à 75% sur leur entièreté, mais seulement sur la part qui DEPASSE 1 million. 

Un exemple abstrait mais simple : sur un revenu de 200, une taxe globale à 75% donne 50. Ce n'est pas ce qui arrive. La taxe n'agit qu'au-dessus d'une certaine somme. Disons au-dessus de 100 : tout ce qui est au-dessus de 100 est taxé à 75%, ce qui laisse 25, et donc 125 de revenus, et pas 50.

Chaque tranche du revenu est taxée ainsi, jusqu'à la tranche suivante si elle est atteinte.

Je vois que notre tableau a été partagé ici et qu'il fait parler. Vous pourrez d'ailleurs en voir une version optimisée et mise à jour en bas de la page ici : http://www.worldinception.com/projet

Merci tout d'abord de vous y intéresser, cela nous touche et nous encourage à faire progresser notre site Worldinception.

Pour répondre à quelques commentaires : 

- Ce tableau n'est pas une synthèse des programmes mais un tableau résumé des positions de chaque candidat sur les débats de société. Vous pouvez en revanche retrouver tous les programmes thème par thème pour chaque candidat actuel ici : www.worldinception.com/projet et promis on a rien modifié ! Cette page sera par ailleurs actualisée dès que la liste des candidats et les programmes de ces derniers sera définitive.


- Pourquoi ces débats et pas d'autres ? Bonne question, nous avons initié l'idée afin d'aider nos membres inscrits à se faire une opinion et ce sont les points qui nous semblaient revenir le plus souvent et qui portaient le mieux à la synthèse, car comme dit dans vos commentaires, certaines politiques ne se résument pas à un oui ou non - d'où l'intérêt de lire les programmes disponibles ! Néanmoins nous sommes ouverts aux suggestions et nous avons donc ajouté 2 lignes traitant d'Hadopi et de la taxe sur les transactions financières.

- Un débat de société se pose généralement vers une nouveauté ou une opposition à la situation existante. Nous avons repris les intitulés de ces débats les plus communément lus/entendus. Contrairement à d'autres sites proposant des comparatifs pour savoir si les candidats sont pour la diminution de la dette ou pour le sauvetage de l'industrie française pour mieux promouvoir leur champion - comme si un candidat allait ouvertement s'opposer à ces objectifs - nous ne soutenons personne et rapportons un état des lieux, et encore une fois, n'étant pas parfaits, nous sommes ouverts à toute discussion si vous constatez une erreur.

- Le rouge et le vert sont les couleurs utilisées sur notre site pour voter pour ou contre chaque contribution. Il ne faut voir aucun symbole dans l'utilisation du feu vert pour approuver et du feu rouge pour s'opposer... 

- A la personne qui pense que nous sommes partisans des Verts, il suffit de se promener sur Worldinception et notamment sur les pages www.worldinception.com/concept et www.worldinception.com/faq pour savoir que nous ne sommes affiliés à aucun parti et à aucune association. Vous pouvez écrire ce que vous voulez, soutenir qui vous voulez sur notre site tant que vous respectez la charte (www.worldinception.com/charte). Si certains en doutent, qu'ils s'inscrivent !

I would say that all talk and care about isolation comes from Britain, not from Europe.

Mannheim is really near to HD, I recommend you to spend some time there - since HD is a really nice place (I could recommend some things to you if you're interested). Mannheim is in my opinion not a ""shithole"" or anything. Its truely not the most beautiful city, but many great things are located there (museums, cafes, parks) and shopping is also no problem. Things I recommend for you:
Stars at ""Paradeplatz"" in the ""Stadthaus N1"" (its a bar, located at the highest point of the ""Stadthaus"" with walls made of glass - the view is quite nice!)
The ""Fernmeldeturm"" which is the afaik highest building in MA.
For chilling and hanging out with friends I recommend the ""Luisen Park"" which is a Park (you'll have to pay to get inside - but you are a student so its cheaper).

Besides Mannheim is a great spot for trips (connection to the Ryanair Airport/Frankfurt Airport and the trains is great!): e.g. to France (Elsass), or the ""legendary"" Blackforest/wood? ""Schwarzwald"" (you'll be there with a Baden-Württemberg-Ticket via train which only costs you 25€ and brings you there in about 2 hours)

don't hesitate to ask me :)

You need to top it up to start it working. After that, it will take 3.50€ off your balance each week for you to get the advertised internet package. When your credit gets below 3.50 and it fails to take the money out your balance you lose the 'unlimited' internet. You just need to top it up again to start it back working.
You get 100mb of interent access at full speed per week. Anything over that you get a reduced speed connection but it's still no extra cost. The 3G is fast enough to call back to the UK on Skype for nothing while on the move, although you'll have to watch your download usage.

**Make friends with girls!** They'll understand your worries as a woman and a foreigner, as well as knowing what parts of Florence are to be ignored etc. They'll make sure you have a good time, bla bla :)

En cuanto a socialmente, depende mucho de si se trata de un pueblo pequeño en el interior (en la costa debido al turismo hay mucha más tolerancia) o una ciudad. En los pueblos las familias están más preocupadas por lo que pensarán los vecinos y eso puede reflejarse en la aceptación de la homosexualidad.

En los últimos años varios presentadores y estrellas de televisión abiertamente homosexuales (por ejemplo [Boris Izaguirre](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Izaguirre) o [Jesús Vázquez](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jes%C3%BAs_V%C3%A1zquez)) han adquirido mucha popularidad. Esto ha tenido un efecto muy positivo en la generación de mujeres nacidas en los años 40-50. En su generación la homosexualidad no era aceptada en absoluto, pero dado que estas figuras públicas les caen simpáticas, su visión ha cambiado. Posteriormente estas mujeres ejercen también cierta influencia positiva sobre sus maridos.

Salvo contadas excepciones en cualquier gran ciudad no existe ningún problema en mostrarse abiertamente homosexual en público. En caso de haber problemas, habitualmente sería en zonas de la ciudad donde el nivel cultural y educativo es menor. Esto también es una de las causas de la menor aceptación en el entorno rural.

Como anécdota, los peluqueros (para mujeres) son especialmente valorados cuando son homosexuales.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The feeling in the republic is more of a cosmopolitan outlook, and a more european feel. Irish people, although a bit broke after the financial break down are quite pro-europe. The anti-european sentiment seems only firmly rooted in england, although I think that can be largely put down to the media. 

If you stop for a moment and forget about all the nationalism, we are very european. We are rather socialist (if you ignore the current tory government) and really we are more culturally similar to Europe than to the Anglosphere. Although we speak a common language  thats about the only thing that unites us. I think in the UK when we see the american christian extremists we are quite aghast, and that sort of outlines our whole cultural difference, whether it's their extreme right wing or their ignorance of the poor.

We have spent the majority of our history as part of europe and engaged in europe. It's only been in the last 100 or so years that we have drew ourselves away. As you said, we wanted a divided Europe because it meant we'd be more powerful. Maybe it's just me, but I'd prefer to be an active part of the EU and contribute, to make a success of Europe on the global stage. My french friend always says British people are perhaps the most european people of all. We're a germanic tribe heavily influenced by romance language speakers and invaded by just about everyone.

I don't really think people know what they want. A while back there was some serious consideration in an EU referendum, and if you were watching the polls you could see the people squirm as the people for staying in the EU rose dramatically. The media would have you believe that we are in the middle of the atlantic ocean, but really the EU has done a lot to help us, and we certainly wouldn't have minimum wage, maximum weekly working hours, stringent rules on what can go in our food, strong environmental targets, E numbers, the channel tunnel or Nigel Farage. I realise a few of these are up for debate but you get the idea. In essence the EU has helped to protect its citizens more so than perhaps the British government has. Just look at what seems to be the privatization of the NHS. I'm afraid I have very little respect for any politicians at the minute, but at least I know that the ones I vote for in Brussels seem to have good intentions and are voted for by proportional representation.

As a finishing point I'd like to add if we stay separate from the EU we face being swayed by the larger blocs. A recent report showed Norway was just as integrated as the UK in the EU, only it didn't have representation. Switzerland recently pegged their currency to the Euro and Iceland has pretty much been forced to join since the bank collapse. The UK would be more influenced by the US if we left, and I don't really like the idea of any US policy influence in the UK.

Oh yeah, and in the next 50 years the UK and France's military power and international recongition as super powers is going to diminish even further. I know a lot of people say 'IDC look at Norway they're happy' but this sort of blends in with my point on being affected but not having any say in what happens. If we do leave the EU, I don't mind, as long as I can move some place else before it happens.

Here's what went down: Your online booking query wasn't accepted because of the payment problem - so at the time you were calling, no ticket reservation had been made yet, hence no invoice. The service agent then proceeded to make the booking for you, informing you about the price they saw in their system; at that exact moment in time, it was still identical to the one you'd seen on the website. Then, at some point during that process, this particular fare bucket was emptied by another customer, moving all remaining tickets for that flight to the next price category. It's the nature of the beast with low-cost carriers. I'm assuming that the service agent failed to notice the price hike in time, OR (s)he didn't complete your booking until after your conversation ended. Either way, the fact that you weren't immediately informed about it was definitely negligence on their part. Exactly how forgiving or how (understandably) upset you are about it is entirely up to you.

Now while I am pretty sure you didn't fall prey to a shady business practice, you were caused some inconvenience by a case of sloppy customer service. Since you have accepted the higher price upon being called back, you legally agreed to a contract.

However  if you bothered to listen to BBC Newsnight  you would have also heard how Europe (EU) was well aware of this fact. Greece had informed the EU regarding the manner in which they were stating the figures.  Eurostat overlooked this.

Italy downturn fails to curb bond appetite

By Guy Dinmore and Giulia Segreti

Bond markets are rediscovering their enthusiasm for Italy even as evidence emerges daily of the worsening plight of its real economy – a striking divergence of views that is starting to trouble investors.

Just as yields on 10-year bonds fell below 5 per cent this month, prompting some commentators to herald an ending of the eurozone debt crisis, Italy reported on the same day that unemployment levels had jumped to the highest in over a decade.

The country is back in recession, official data have since confirmed, with industry and consumer spending in decline. Industrial output in January was five per cent down on a year earlier, while a study by Intesa Sanpaolo, a bank, shows that national consumption of food, drink and tobacco fell in 2011 to levels last seen 30 years ago.

Weighed down by austerity measures imposed by Silvio Berlusconi, former prime minister, last year and reinforced by Mario Monti’s technocratic government in December, Italy’s shrinking economy and its struggle to remain globally competitive is reflected in the ailing fortunes of its two biggest industrial groups.

John Elkann, chairman of Fiat, expects Italians to buy fewer cars this year than they did in 1985. Registration of new Fiat group cars in Europe fell 16.7 per cent in February from a year earlier. 

Finmeccanica, the state-controlled defence and industrial conglomerate employing 74,000 workers in Italy, is predicted by analysts to report this month a loss of over €2bn for 2011 and set out plans to dispose of lossmaking divisions.

Whereas electricity producers were fretting four years ago that Italy lacked generating capacity, one senior utility executive told the Financial Times he feared that industrial consumption would never return to the then levels.

Analysts warn the worst is yet to come. This month Italians will feel the first impact of Mr Monti’s revenue-raising measures when they start paying higher regional income tax. In June reintroduction of a tax on first homes and higher rates on second homes come into force, to be followed in October by a further rise in value added tax.

“The depressive effects are evident,” says Giuseppe Bortolussi, head of CGIA Mestre, a business association. “Although the objective should be to make the economy grow, the opposite is happening.”

Pierpaolo Benigno, economics professor at Rome’s Luiss university, says cheap financing of banks by the European Central Bank is the driving force behind the sharp drop in Italy’s borrowing costs, but this is only a short-term solution.

Mr Monti and his team of technocrats have been given too much credit on international markets for “doing little”, he says, criticising over-reliance on raising taxes rather than cutting spending.

“If we really want to talk about increasing competition in Italy then we must lower taxes in various directions, both for companies and households, and then we should continue by slashing public expenditure, which is high and inefficient,” he says. 

This echoes the view of big business in Milan, where Mr Monti is seen as lacking resolve in his reforms. Legislation to liberalise the service sector and professions was diluted under pressure from lobbies and centre-right parties in parliament, while the government may yet bow to pressure from trade unions and centre-left parties by weakening its proposals to reform the labour market.

Mr Monti on Thursday bowed to intense pressure from banks, saying his government was willing to reinstate bank commission on credit lines in legislation before parliament.

The danger is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy but a perennial underperformer, will remain burdened by low growth and high debt for years to come. 

The Bank of Italy predicts a fall of 1.5 per cent in GDP in 2012. Public debt rose by €37.9bn to a record €1.936tn in January, due in part to Italy’s funding of its share of EU bailouts for Greece, Portugal and Ireland.

Nonetheless Maria Cannata, head of Italy’s debt management agency, says foreign investors will return. On Wednesday she expressed confidence that the yield gap with German 10-year bonds would narrow to 200 basis points by the end of 2012 from around 290 points at present, having hit a record of more than 570 last November.

But some analysts remain sceptical. “The fundamental challenges facing Italy and Spain are well documented and are unlikely to move far out of the spotlight,” Citi analysts commented, adding: “The longer term macro risks are likely to continue to deter non-domestic investors from engaging in a meaningful way.”",0,1332097247,null,0,false,0,c42bsco,t3_r2asc,t1_c42bsco,t3_r2asc,null,1435729911,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Doing this does a few things –  because I’m first and foremost learning how to hear that language’s sounds, my listening comprehension gets an immediate boost before I even start traditional language age learning.  Once I start vocabulary training, I retain it better because I’m familiar with how words should sound and how they should be spelled.  (Correct spellings in French, for example, are much easier to remember when there’s a connection between the spelling and the sound), and once I finally start speaking to native speakers, they don't switch to English for me or dumb down their language, which is awesome sauce.

 
Stage 2: Vocab and grammar acquisition (itself in a few stages), no English allowed

I start with a frequency list and mark off any words I can portray with pictures alone (basic nouns and verbs).  I put those in an Anki deck and learn them.  Once I have some words to play with, I start putting them together.  I use Google translate and a grammar book to start making sentences, then get everything doublechecked at lang-8.com.  Turning them into fill-in-the-blank flashcards builds the initial grammar and connecting words.  As vocab and grammar grow, I eventually move to monolingual dictionaries and writing my own definitions for more abstract words (again doublechecked at lang-8.com).  This builds on itself; the more vocab and grammar you get, the more vocab and grammar concepts you can describe in the target language.  Eventually you can cover all the words in a 2000 word frequency list and any specific vocab you need for your specific interests.



Stage 3: Listening, writing and reading work

Once I have a decent vocabulary and familiarity with grammar, I start writing essays, watching TV shows and reading books.  Every writing correction gets added to the Anki deck, which continues to build my vocab and grammar.



Stage 4: Speech

At the point where I can write 'fluently', I find some place to immerse in the language and speak all the time (literally.  No English allowed or else you won't learn the skill you're trying to learn, which is adapting to holes in your grammar or vocabulary by going around them rapidly and automatically without having to think about it).  I prefer Middlebury college, but a few weeks in the target country will work as well if you're very vigorous with sticking to the target language and not switching to English.  If you're extremely strict with yourself, your brain adapts pretty quickly and learns how to put all the info you learned in stages 1-3 together quickly enough to turn into fluent speech.

true,keindeutschsprechen,null,null,"Depends on what you want to do of course. You can find the prices in advance generally. Of course I assume you already planned for housing and obvious stuff.

Restaurants are around 25 to 40€ I think, more if you go to higher-class places of course. If you just want to eat for cheap, you have many small places that are much cheaper (down to 5€ for a kebab). If you want to visit Monaco, the best is to use the train, it's not expensive (little note: Monaco is small, it takes just a few hours top, and there's not that much to see). Same goes with Cannes and Antibes. Beaches are free except the private ones where you have a bar and something to lie on.

What are you into? Beaches, visiting, sports, nature…?

In Nice you ~~can~~ will walk around ""Place Massena"", ""Promenade des Anglais"", ""Cours Saleya"" and the old town. There's the ""castle"" of course, which is nothing more than some ruins, but it's on top of a large rock in the middle of Nice, in front of the sea, so it's really nice (pun not intended). Then on the other side of this rock, there's the harbour and the city around which is less ""touristic"" but is still quite in the center. Of course, next to ""Place Massena"" there's the ""Avenue Jean Médecin"" which is a main shopping street.

Concerning nearby cities, Villefranche-sur-mer has a really beautiful bay, but it's very popular to go to the beach there, so it's usually crowded in the summer. There are lots of boats coming as well, even huge ships sometimes. Generally the beaches are quite crowded in the summer, but it varies from place to place. Menton is not bad to pass as well. Antibes is nice, you can walk all around the cape, it's a pleasant walk. There's Cannes of course, which is the average city except for the seaside which is full of expensive shops and hotels (and Cannes' bay is quite beautiful too). Grasse is (supposed to be) the ""capital of perfume"", and it has a pleasant city center.

Other than that, the mountains are very pleasant, there are many villages, hikes trails, climbing paths… within an hour drive. If you have a car and an afternoon (and a clear weather), you can go to ""Gourdon"", it's a small village with a castle, but it's on top of a mountain and you have a view over the whole area, from Nice to Cannes I think.

Common transportation is fine there, especially since they built the tramway line through the center. Otherwise there are many buses. But if you don't mind walking, I think it's better to wander in the areas I put above.

Avoid the far east part of Nice, called l'Ariane (I mean, you can pass there, but please know that you don't really want to be alone at night especially without speaking French). But it's quite far from the center, so you shouldn't worry about it. ""Las Planas"" has a bit of this reputation as well, but it's not as bad.

EDIT: I don't know too many places, but the old town is full of restaurants. I've been to ""Le bistrot du fromager"" recently, and it's awesome; everything is based on cheese, and the wine is great; it's about 35€ though (think of booking). The ""Astrolab's"" at St Laurent's harbour isn't bad. If you want to eat some Nice's speciality, there's the socca (it's the name of the dish). Go at ""Chez Pipo"" at the harbour; take some pissaladière also to start with, and some wine; and it's cheap. I'm not sure you can book though, there's some queue usually.",0,1332102347,null,0,true,0,c42cmxl,t3_r2cfw,t1_c42cmxl,t3_r2cfw,null,1428548787,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

The bigger problem is that Greece's industry is very small-scale mom-and-pop type industry, which isn't competitive in a modern world. While Germans are working for BMW and SAP, and Danes are working for Lego, Carlsberg, and Maersk, Greeks are working for small olive farms and family-run tavernas, which doesn't do much for GDP. Despite the fact that Greeks on average work more hours/week than Germans or Danes, their companies are just not large-scale enough to compete with large corporations, so their productivity (measured in monetary terms) is considerably lower.
