To add a bit to the tips already given
- Travel around if you have time. There is plenty to see in Salamanca, but Madrid, Ávila, Cáceres, Segovia, etc are just a short train or bus ride away. 
- For the mandatory tapas, avoid the touristy places around the plaza mayor... try around Van Dyck (the side streets around Torres Villaroel) that's where the real stuff is at!
- As for the nightlife I would say the same thing; you will see there are lots of places to choose from but again, I would avoid the more touristy clubs.  Paniagua, La Imprenta (calle Varillas) and Bolero have quite the local flavor.
I hope you have a lovely stay in Salamanca! ",0,1328996326,null,0,false,0,c3q8shf,t3_pbndk,t1_c3q8shf,t3_pbndk,null,1428336791,2,false,es,t5_22i2,2

true,Stereo,ZBTLuxembourg,Luxembourg,"Au pain de mon grand père, 55 rue de la Krutenau, est la meilleure boulangerie de Strasbourg. Il y a la queue pour le pain du mardi au dimanche. Rien que de penser à leurs croissants, Strasbourg me manque.

Pour une pâtisserie tout à fait classique bien strasbourgeoise, allez chez Kubler, 29 avenue des Vosges, goûter une torche aux marrons. Là aussi, c'est fermé le lundi. Mireille Oster a sa boutique de pain d'épice 14 rue des dentelles, mais aussi un stand sur le marché de Noël place Kleber. En période de Noël, je pense qu'elle est ouverte tous les jours.

Est-ce que vous serez là samedi matin? Ne ratez pas le [marché des petits producteurs](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:Strasbourg_apiculteur_march%C3%A9_producteurs_2011.JPG), place du marché aux poissons. J'aime surtout le munster fermier, le miel, le pain et le jus de poire qu'on y trouve.

Du quai en-dessous du marché, il y a des bateaux qui promènent les touristes sur l'Ill et les canaux. Sur la place de la cathédrale, juste au début de la rue en face de la cathédrale, il y a une maison en coin qui a toutes les infos pour les spectacles et événements. L'office de tourisme de Strasbourg, à quelques mètres à droite en sortant de la cathédrale, propose des belles promenades à travers Strasbourg.

Encore quelques adresses en vrac : [Poêles de carottes](http://www.poelesdecarottes.com/) dans la petite France pour sa cuisine originale, ses desserts délicieux et le chef sympa, et [Bistrot &amp; Chocolat](http://bistrotetchocolat.net/) par la même équipe pour le goûter après avoir monté la tour de la Cathédrale ; les [bains municipaux](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Bains_municipaux_(Strasbourg)) en style art nouveau de l'avenue de la Victoire, qui ont un charme désuet — essayez la piscine et les bains romains ; [le Tire-Bouchon](http://www.letirebouchon.fr), resto typiquement alsacien ; et le soir, les frères Berthom, 18 rue des Tonneliers, pour une vaste sélection de bières.

Festivals - there is always a lot going on in Paris , [especially in summer](http://www.google.fr/#hl=fr&amp;cp=14&amp;gs_id=55&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=paris+ete+les+concerts&amp;pq=tour+eiffel&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;source=hp&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=paris+ete+les+concerts&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=&amp;gs_upl=&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=9a61d5b4e5924150&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=628). [Keep a look out on the town council web sites](http://www.paris.fr/) for starters . Also look at places that sell concert tickets such as [FNAC](http://fnac.fr/) . There are major concerts around the [Eiffle Tower](http://www.tour-eiffel.fr/) - such as the 14th. of July .

Security - like any big city you have to be careful - basically :-

1) keep you wallet in a safe place - inside jacket pocket or in a shoulder bag .

2) keep your shoulder bag in front of you . Make sure that it is fastened .

3) watch out on escalators - the trick of the thieves is to reach over from the other escalator and pull any bags off people . The escalators going in opposite directions does the rest .

4) watch out for distraction tactics . Thieves will use knives to cut bag straps .

5) keep your eyes and ears open . Make eye contact - so they know you have spotted them .

A friend of a friend lost a small bag with their wallet etc. in it , in central Paris , a few years ago by not taking precautions .

I had a minor incident on an escalator in Les Halles a couple of years ago but managed it such that nothing was stolen . Other than that there was just one local incident where a druggie was giving some other poor guy hell where I stepped in . Otherwise I have not had any problems .

true,Vuvuzevka,ZZChaton,Miaou,"Well, here some of my recommendations, I tried to choose unique songs, from artist not already quoted there, while trying to focus on typical french artist I like, with lyrics and there historical contest could be particulary intersting in a class environnement also.

Let's start with the hymn of French Resistance, composed by Anna Marly (french singer born in Russia) [Le chant des partisans](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaXZStHXBbQ).


You could also listen to some Jean Guidoni ([Je pourris camarade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmM4MoDOgP8)). Be careful though it tends to be as beautiful as depressing. Or, Léo Férré ([Avec le temps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiXcUTTLud4)), an anarchist singer.


More joyful you have Boby Lapointe, who made an amazing use of puns in his song, it's incredibly fun and intersting to hear and read (I still discover some puns when listening to him, even if I knew him years ago), for exemple : [L'été, où est t'il ?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYDd287GuW4).
Or Boris Vian, famous for some of his writings and poems, but who made great songs too. [Je bois](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qXkV1e6yZY).


And more recently there's also Renaud, who made amazing songs in the 80/90s, famous for using slang in his songs ([Dès que le vent soufflera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm7nGX193bo)). Or Enrico Macias, who is a ""pied noir"" (born in Algeria when it was a french colony) [La france de mon enfance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJiNuO2Rza4).




In totally other styles, and maybe less ""intersting"", but all sung in french :

- [Antisocial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOVhneQqdvo) from Trust (Anthrax made a cover of this one)
- [Manipulé](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2rTb3vXqRQ) from Tagada Jones (hardcore punk band)

Firstly, what do they mean, by ""primary ancestor""? Genetical, or cultural? 

Genetically, I don't think there is any dispute that modern Romanians are the descendants of all the peoples that settled in this territory (and that is true anywhere, not just in Romania). So that would be Dacians (who may or may not be a subset of Thracians), colonists from the Roman Empire, Goths, Slavs, Pechenegs, Cumans, and others I am probably missing. Thracians are not necessarily among them.

Culturally, most important would be the language. The Romanian language has several layers:

* A Balkan substratum - some grammar features and a few words. Its origins [are not established](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_sprachbund#Origins)

* A vulgar latin core - most of the grammar and about 20-30% of the vocabulary.

* Significant slavic influences especially in the vocabulary (15-20%), but also in the grammar.

* A layer of loan words from French and other Western European languages, taken in starting from the 19th century.

brainlessnick is right about lodging though I thought Erasmus students pretty much always get offered accommodation from Studentenwerk. I think my best advice would be that you get a room or hostel for the first few days (weeks) from some of the students that leave the city during the holidays and then look for a room while you're here, since looking on wg-gesucht.de is going to help you nothing being in Portugal.

Regarding language, you will not have any problem at the university. Every semester there's more and more international students and it will be the third year that the English program is offered. However, people on the streets not always speak English, especially when looking for a room on wg-gesucht, people tend to ignore requests in English, they somehow look like some kind of a scam and there's other hundred people asking for the same room anyway.

The university has a great reputation and is *arguably* the best engineering school in Germany.

Munich is freaking expensive. As brainlessnick pointed out, the best strategy is to get cheap accommodation and try to not frequent night clubs. There's plenty of house parties among students that will get you covered on that end, so don't worry about not being able to meet people and have fun.

One last comment about the accommodation, get in touch with the international office of the TUM ([TUMi](http://www.international.tum.de/en/welcome-at-tum/internationale-studierende/tuminternational/)), they usually help out students coming from abroad to find accommodation at the residence halls, whenever there's one available and you apply way in advance; the sooner the better. You can also PM me your facebook name and I can add you to the TUMi group, the Informatics group and other Erasmus networks here in Munich so you can start looking there, if you'd like. Other than that you can contact the international students [advisor](http://www.in.tum.de/en/for-prospective-students/international-opportunities/prospective-students-from-abroad.html), she's usually eager to help.",0,1329067447,null,0,false,0,c3qgnvu,t3_pladd,t1_c3qgnvu,t3_pladd,null,1428340572,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

Well, truth be told, Balkanic is a somewhat fuzzy term. And I don't Have a problem with your nouances, but I felt you were running away from our Balkanness. 

Also, keep in mind that the Capital is in the most Balkanic part of Romania, so maybe that ads an extra Balkanness to the country. As a Transylvanian with relatives in Greece, I know we are not *that* Balkanic, but that we also are.

&gt;it is one more aspect in which Thracians are not our ""primary ancestor""

I think Thracians (if we accept Dacians as a subset of Thracians) are our ancestors in a genetic sense of the way. Oversimplification: if we wanna go back all the way our ancestors are the first who settled here, who somewhere along the way got Indo-Europeanised, became „Dacians” then those guys got Latinised, than later those same guys got partially Slavicised.

If the UMP doesn't split I think the contender are François Fillon (current prime minister), Alain Juppé (former prime minister, current foreign affairs minister) and Jean-François Copé (current party leader in the lower house).

François Fillon has been very discrete as a prime minister and he stayed in the position for the whole 5 years (an amazing feat in the Fifth Republic). He's planning to be MP for Paris after the next election. Fun fact: he's a known anglophile, his wife being British. He's reasonably moderate.

Alain Juppé is another moderate. Chirac used to call him ""the best among us"". He's known to be very smart, having passed through the most famous schools (Normale Sup, ENA). He's often seen to cold and distant. He was cast away for a few years for being a faithful right-hand of Chirac and thus caught in some legal turmoil. This had the beneficial side-effect of making him more direct and frank. I think he's really as smart as he's painted. He's liked by the center-right who are very close to quit the UMP and thus could help the party stay united.

Jean-François Copé has been pretty clear that he wants to be the right-wing candidate for 2017. He's a very cunning politician but also seen rightfully as a hypocrite and too ambitious. However the very same  traits never stopped Sarkozy.

Now, if the UMP split we could go back to what the right was before 2002 and the birth of the UMP. There was the UDF, center-right, and the RPR, regular right. With the National Front trying to become more mainstream, there's a space for a major center-right party bringing together the moderate wing of the UMP, the Parti Radical Valoisien, the Nouveau Centre and the MoDem (all former wings of the UDF). At the same time, the RPR could be reborn with a more hardcore right-wing stance, possibly allying itself at least tacitely with the National Front. The center-right could be led by François Bayrou (our local Nick Clegg, allied together in the ALDE group in the European Parliament), 3rd in the 2007 election and slated to be 3rd or 4th in the 2012 elections. The better his score, the most likely this scenario. I'm not sure who could lead the hardcore right-wing. This space is crowded by the many lieutnants of Sarkozy, it looks like Alexander the Great empire after it's death.",0,1329076838,null,0,false,0,c3qi6wf,t3_pg2gd,t1_c3qi6wf,t1_c3psjl8,null,1428341297,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Schon der Anfang: ""Eine Unterstellung, die in der freiheitlich-demokratischen Grundordnung nicht sein darf"" - klar, formal mag das sein, aber bei einer so nichtigen Sache mit der freiheitlich demokratischen Grundordnung zu kommen, finde ich schon ein wenig übertrieben. Es ist eben eine etwas suggestiv formulierte Entscheidungsfrage*, aber die ist im Boulevard-Journalismus keine Seltenheit und dort (und nur dort) in meinen Augen auch durchaus legitim, schließlich geht es darum, möglichst schnell möglichst prägnante Meinungsäußerungen vom ""kleinen Mann"" zu bekommen.

Was das eigentliche Thema angeht, finde ich seine Ansicht zwar nachvollziehbar, aber letztendlich irrelevant. Es ist nun mal ein Ritual, das viele Menschen schön finden und deshalb begehen, und der Valentinstag ist dazu in meinen Augen auch keine moralisch besonders verwerfliche Tradition, ebenso wenig wie Silvester. Wenn er daran nicht teilnehmen will, ist das seine Sache, aber ich finde es ziemlich irritierend, diese Ansicht im Brustton moralischer Überlegenheit vorzutragen.

&gt;have you any idea how much is the property tax incorporated in the electricity bill (meaning that if you don't have money to pay it you will have no electricity)? have you ever heard about that?

Yes I have and you are welcome to compare that property tax to Sweden's or Denmarks or UK, France etc for that matter. You have just started to pay property tax - we have been paying it for decades. So you are paying a bill we have been paying for ages, and you are demonstrating that. How many millions more have my countrymen paid in property tax than yours? (Sweden, second highest taxes in the world, I do not feel sorry for someone who started to payproperty tax  in 2010)Also, I know that you are paying on your electricity bill because you do not have a central property register, like other countries (so you could avoid paying). Why don't you build it up properly, like the rest of the EU. Why should you not pay property taxes when the rest of the EU do?


No matter how you compare it, you are still cheating on your taxes. And, 6 out of 10 Greeks with no income, at all? You do know that in the rest of Europe, we even pay taxes on our pensions?

You might be tired of hearing that it's your fault, but it's still pretty much true, and Greeks should learn something from it.

The crux of my argument is not that austerity is somehow good, it is that the creditors, right or wrong truly deserve to have more say and input into Greece's budget strategy than even Greece itself at this point.

I think because Greece is so polarized by these actions at this point, that austerity measures will indeed fail -- it is clear that the government and the people are not in agreement with bringing spending inline with revenues.

The reason these people do not pay taxes is because they fall below the limit of 12000€ per year set by the tax system. In fact, it is impossible for salaried Greeks to cheat on income tax. The taxes along with almost everything else are subtracted from your pay before it gets in your hands. the companies, in collusion with politicians may not pay the taxes to the state and a lot of them don't but people living on salary have nothing to do with that.

These are the people getting reamed by these austerity measures. Because they're easy to get to.

As to the shadow economy. Let me give you an example of how stuff worked (hopefully not any more in Greece). The revenue service has set rates for taxing income according to a business' subject. For example in computers, you get taxed 20% pre-VAT for sales (I think) and 25% for services. But in that sector the market works with less than 10% margins. In short, you lose money when you make a sale. So in order to work you have to cheat on your taxes.

The problems in Greece are systemic. Unless these are fixed we'll end up right back in the hole. And neither this package nor anything before did anything about it. Because people like you believe that Greeks just lay around collecting checks and scheming about ways to steal your hard earned money. So your politicians take the easy way out and go for punitive measures and come back to you and say ""See, we punished these crooks! Vote for us!""

We have a limit of € 1100, at less than 1/10th of what you have.......So, we start paying taxes much much earlier. So no, I do not feel sorry for you, I think it's staggering that you wait so long before starting to pay. As I said, you pay rates, not absolute sums. That means almost all of us are paying taxes to some extent as well, why can't you? Why should you be different from us in that regard?



&gt;For example in computers, you get taxed 20% pre-VAT for sales (I think) and 25% for services. But in that sector the market works with less than 10% margins. In short, you lose money when you make a sale. So in order to work you have to cheat on your taxes.

Why is it like that then? Why are you not more effective? Do you think you are the only country in the world with 25 % VAT? You have systematically cheated the system, hasn't bothered about being effective, and then you claim that you *have to* cheat. We have 25 % VAT too- and we can make a profit. If the rest of the EU can, why can't you? That really angers me, claiming that you have to have cheat, just like the rest of us didn't have any VAT.


Also, you do not seem to know a lot of other countries tax system. Are you the only one with VAT? Taxation starting at €12 000? Read up, comparatively you are rather low (for the EU) and you've had years and years, when the average Greek person hasn't paid taxes the rest of us had too (like property tax). Why didn't you protest this, your broken tax- and budget system like the OECD report pointed out (one of several). A working state needs proper tax collection system, so that everyone (companies, taxpayers, politicians) can pay. 


&gt;The problems in Greece are systemic. Unless these are fixed we'll end up right back in the hole. And neither this package nor anything before did anything about it. Because people like you believe that Greeks just lay around collecting checks and scheming about ways to steal your hard earned money.

I have never said you laid around collecting checks or scheming, you are putting words in my mouth (or writing). 

I have however pointed to several links that shows that the system is broken (I agree with you there) but you do not get such a broken system, so low on the corruption list, such damaging reports from the OECD etc without massive co -operation, all across the board I can understand you not liking the banks, but no one did this to the Greeks, you did it to yourself.

I read the links, thank you, they were interesting and of course one can feel sorry for individuals. But you know your property tax is still lower than ours, so I am really having a hard time being sympathetic as well. Oh, and ours is tied to the house too, not to a persons income or anything. Can't pay - move.


&gt;Seeing so many people for several months now in streets in very violent riots, don' t you at least question yourselves? Never crossed your mind that those people are either despaired or they really want something different, so in both cases let them have it?...


Of course, but  you have been protesting for a long time now. I saw you protesting a retirement age of 65 (we have 67). I saw you protesting the fact that the pensions have to be based on median income, not the last 5 years (like we already have, which almost every OECD county has). I saw you protest property tax (something we've been paying for ages) and increasing the VAT to our levels.....Half of the protest seemed to be against doing something the rest of Europe has been doing for ages, and that doesn't really win any sympathy points with me. In the last months however, there seem to be a desperation that makes me feel sorry for Greece, you are not in a fun position and many are hurting. 


I don't really know what you mean with ""Let them have it"". I mean, if you want to exit/default, absolutely (although I think it would be more damaging for Greece than the austerity measures). 


As for different - yes, of course you need to change your system.but it has to come from within. You have an election coming up, vote for change then. Vote for a system with proper taxation and budgets who is fighting corruption.Vote for whatever you like, but you have to fix this.

You have systematically cheated the system, hasn't bothered about being effective, and then you claim that you have to cheat. We have 25 % VAT too- and we can make a profit. If the rest of the EU can, why can't you? That really angers me, claiming that you have to have cheat, just like the rest of us didn't have any VAT.

Sorry, I didn't write clearly and just noticed. Let me try and be clearer. Say you make 1250€ sales. You pay back the VAT and you're left with 1000€. You pay back your suppliers and you're left with 100€. Come tax time the revenue service wants you to pay the tax for 200€ because that's the rate the tax code dictates. That was my point. The tax system is stupid and hostile and creates an antagonistic relationship  between a business and the state. I'd fucking kill if I could start a business without jumping through a million hoops and without taking as a given that I'd have to cheat in order for it to work. Even if that meant I have to pay taxes from the first euro I make.

And do not mistake me for some retarded commie screaming ""Down with the banks and down with the EU."" Nor am I some far right goon screaming about selling out our national sovereignty. The huge majority of the blame falls on us and us alone. And I've got into a lot of arguments for having this opinion. As I said fuck us. My problem is, and I hope I'm wrong, that Europe is more concerned with punishing those lazy Greeks than with helping Greece not suck as a European country.

What should happen is that Greece should declare themselves bankrupt like Argentina did a decade ago, and the banks should accept that they won't be getting that money back.

&gt;I hope I'm wrong, that Europe is more concerned with punishing those lazy Greeks than with helping Greece not suck as a European country. 

It is hard not go get annoyed when I see protest against things we've been having for ages, so why do people complain about things that the rest of Europe have(like starting paying taxes at € 12 000, I'd love that, retire at 65 when we have 67 and counting, raising your VAT to our level, etc)? Personally I do get irritated when I see that and honestly, why are you guys  complaining about that? Might be a ""moral view"" but don't people have a right to question why you  receive money, but not have our level of taxation?


One things that also baffles me, and I think contributes to a ""moral superior"" view is that Greece hasn't protested these things before, when they benefited from a broken tax system, when the pension was based on the last five years etc.


That said, does it matter at this point? No, not really (although I will argue to death if someone complains or says Greece didn't do anything),and as you say, it starting to be besides the point. One can see that Greece is suffering.


I don't think the EU can save you. I always think one has to save oneself (any country or person) and  the most the EU can do is to not support the incorrect guys, but ultimately Greece has to change themselves. What I do hope for you is that the crisis awareness now is so big, that your system is starting to change from within. One of the problems seems (to me) to be that people feels that the changes are imposed from the EU and are not willing to implement them. I haven't seen any other other solutions though, from any Greeks apart from defaulting. If you do not implement it, what are you planning to do?


I agree with you on the fact that EU seems to lack foresight and strategy, they just seem to be putting out fires, but not dealing with the underlying issues, at al., nor do they have any visions.

I just wish there were some forward thinking changes along with the austerity measures.

Also note that a lot of those 70% will come out of your retirement fund or will have to be payed for by your insurance fees (insurers hold a decent share).

The EU isn't forcing Greece to take the money. It's more like ""an offer they can't refuse"", because it's the only way for Greece to avoid bankruptcy. The reason why Greece doesn't just declare bankruptcy is because the situation isn't comparable to Argentina, at all.

Even though the dollar peg was supposed to be irreversible, Argentina technically still had its own currency, and actually has goods to export. If Greece would go back to the drachma, which they'd pretty much would have to do in case of default, they would see a huge capital flight, because holders of assets would try to avoid the inevitable devaluation.  
Argentina had ran into problems through several external factors (devaluation of the Brazilian real, sharp appreciation of the dollar to which the peso was pegged, collapse of prices for agricultural goods, etc.), whereas Greece's problems are mostly internal. After they defaulted on a part of their debt, btw., less than the ""haircut"" of Greek bonds held by the private sector, global prices for agricultural products recovered and exports of them, especially to China, picked up significantly.

The situation in Greece is neither comparable in regards to underlying causes, in terms of the process, and most of all, as far as consequences would go.

You are not wrong in this. But it may change in the future, if the official public lenders decide to take part in this or a future debt haircut. 

&gt; It seems the only way for Greece to get through this is to become an incredibly poor country. And since they are in the EU, and they have the right to live and work in any other country in the EU, doesn't a massive exodus to richer countries with more work seem likely?

If the bailout/austerity thing keeps going without change, then yes, the only way out for Greece is to become incredibly poor. In that case, the massive exodus to richer countries is very likely (for a lot of people, it has already begun). 

However, you are missing a couple of other alternate scenarios: 

One is that the EU transforms itself into some sort of political union with joint debt guarantees or a shared tax base or something like that. If that happens, then wealth will be automatically redistributed so the quality of life in Greece will not fall too far behind. 

A second option is for the Greeks to decide not to put up with this any more. If that happens, all bets are off. It's uncertain how Greece would be punished. The only certain thing is that initially the quality of life in Greece will fall much faster than today.

&gt; Ich habe dich daran erinnert, dass er Außenminister ist, da du offensichtlich nicht kapiert hast, weshalb sich OP's Post auf ihn bezog

Schon klar, mein ursprünglicher Kommentar bezog sich ja auch deswegen auf die FDP weil Westerwelle nun mal ein FDP Politiker ist der nur über die Konstellation der Schwarz-Geld Koalition überhaupt in Reichweite dieser Position kam. Genauso wie der Rest seiner Partei hat er sich in seiner Amtszeit durch ausgiebige Inaktivität und populistisches Phrasendreschen ausgezeichnet und ist eben deswegen (genau wie seine Partei) im Abseits der Volksmeinung verschwunden. Westerwelle würde heute nicht mehr Außenminister werden, ebenso wie die FDP nicht mehr Koalitionspartner werden würde. Daher *""Warum reden wir noch über Westerwelle/FDP? Ist beides irrelevant hat keinen Zweck sich drüber zu echauffieren und lieber mal überlegen wer in Frage kommt die Kasper zu ersetzen.""*. Beim nächsten mal poste ich das.

&gt; dass deine spezifische Meinung zu Westerwelle nichts daran ändert dass er der gottverdammte Außenminister der BRD ist.

Och das lasse ich mal dem Wahlzettel in der Kabine überlassen ob es das ändert oder nicht. Wenn ich mir mal ansehe wie die öffentliche Meinung darum bestellt ist ändert es sehr wohl etwas daran. Schade halt nur dass sich das nur alle vier Jahre anwenden lässt.

4. Liberalizing the labour force - making it easier to hire and fire people, as well as lifting restriction on various sectors.
5. Wage freezing till 2015
6. All union wage agreements that are more than 2 years old are cancelled.
7. No wage/pension automatic increases (eg CPI indexed) until unemployment falls below 10%.

Plus swathes of other cuts in everything from defense to healthcare to infrastructure.

This is in addition to the last 3 years of cuts and tax increases.

All up it's about 7% of GDP worth of cuts. In an economy that has shrunk by &gt;7% each year for the last 3-4 years. It's pretty brutal.

But in essence, the blame should go to the postwar/post-occupation era and how a laissez-faire mentality (by the Brits, USA, and then West Germany) was given to the then present-day Greek government to deal with social, economic, and political rehabilitation in a war torn Greece.  These actions led to the appropriation of the Greek governmental opportunists that led Greece through the anti-communist years with acceptance by their Big Three benefactors.  By doing so, a precedent was set which allowed the Greek government to rule Greece as a parakratos/shadow state until 1974.  By then, it was too late to get reforms into the government because the EU was on the rise and Greece wanted to be a part of this wonderful organization in order for the betterment of the country.  The way that the Greek government went about this was wrong in scope with faulty 'books' which later would show that Greece had a higher debt that led to believe.  This was the impetus to the current situation in Greece, as Greece would not be able to recover under the new Euro and the replacement of the drachma.  This example of how Greece was not prepared to bring the country out of debt and economic rehabilitation without the aid from a benefactor caused a mentality in the Greek government which still plagues Greece today- austerity should have been a proposition during the 1980/1990s.  The race to get Greece ready for the Olympics caused the debt ceiling to rise higher with little to no revenues from outside tourism.  I was there during this time... it was a glorious time for Greece, but at what price?  We see today that riots, strikes and a destitute populace plagues Greece which needs a quick economic recovery in order to ensure the safety of Greece as a nation, as a EU member, and as a measure to stop the exodus of Greece's population.  I shudder to think that if matters get worse, many Greeks will leave seeking jobs and a better life... will this lead to a re-population of Greece by other Balkan countries? Crime and drug use is already at a high during this tumultuous time in Greece, this will only exacerbate the problem.  I love Greece.  I wish to come back after I finish my dissertation here in the states.  I always dreamed of coming back to teach history to the youth of Greece, but as it stands now... if I came I would be worse off than I am here in the States- that breaks my heart.  
 I only wish to add to the discussion- agree with me or disagree with me- the one true thing we can ALL AGREE on is that we LOVE GREECE wholeheartedly!  Without a doubt, the Hellenism that resided in the world during the times of Lord Bryon still exists today. I know of accounts when supplies and material was sent to Greece to help with the impending Greek Revolution in the 1820s... today a new revolution exists- it is a revolution of the people against a government which needs to work on their internal problems as much as the external problems which face Greece presently.  Corruption is a horrid thing to have in a government. Now the Greek populace should hear the calls from classic antiquity and rise against their oppressors.  First it was the Ottomans, the Fascists, the Parakratos, and now the corrupt politicians. I know there are a few run-on sentences and maybe diction mistakes- I am at work typing this very fast.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"To clarify, the ECB is ""owned"" by the various Eurozone members central banks, about proportionally to the respective size of their economy. The ECB can actually earn a surplus, which would get distributed accordingly, but if it would make losses like this then, in order for it to maintain its capital reserve, tax payers (as owners of the ECB's owners) would have to make up for it.

""Bailout"" is just a colloquial term. If you have nowhere else to go, you might give your parents a call to make next month's rent, and they'll hopefully will give you a ""loan"" under very favorable conditions that you wouldn't get anywhere else. That's a bailout.  
So, yes, the money Greece is getting is a loan. The conditions are *very* favorable, and the interest is based on what the donor countries have to pay to borrow the money themselves, as opposed to the risk. The odds that Greece will actually pay all of it back are slim, but it's a big no-no to say that out loud due to a) domestic politics in the donor countries, and b) to not give up leverage over Greece. Those 70% cuts for the private sector will be final, though, worth some €100bn (Argentina's economy is about twice the size of Greece, and they ""only"" defaulted on about $93bn of their debt, then the largest default in history).

Unfortunately you're not reading this wrong. The Greek economy just isn't competitive. There are several reasons for this, but apart from Greece simply not having a lot that they can export, the main one is productivity. Productivity is the measure of output per input, here this means financial cost to produce a good. The cost itself depends on several factors, wages are only a part of it. Others include infrastructure (not just for transport, but presence of suppliers and know-how) or other factors that make doing business difficult or expensive (protection of industries, labor laws, corruption, inefficient bureaucracy, taxes). Greece is doing fine in some of those areas (educated work force, good transport infrastructure), but extremely bad in some others (corruption, nepotism, inefficient bureaucracy, among others).  
You can't just create a good business infrastructure out of thin air, but you can influence it. Normally, what a country in this situation would do is to devalue its currency. This is the easy way out, because it brings cost down equally across the board. You may have to pay more for fuel and other imported goods, but nominally, your wages remain the same, you still have to pay the same rent, your car payments don't go up, and you still make the same relative amount as all the other workers in your country, so price increases are minimal -- the hairdresser might charge you a bit more because imported hair products got more expensive, and food will cost a bit more because of increased costs for fuel and machinery, but overall, social impact is relatively small. The British pound lost about a quarter or a third of its value, for example.

Greece obviously can't do that. Of course they try to reign in corruption, but this is extremely difficult and it takes a long time. So cost has to go down in another way, of which wages have the largest effect, but the can't just say that all wages have to be cut by an equal amount. What they can do, however, is to e.g., reduce the legally required minimum wage or cut the wages of public employees. This if profoundly unfair to those affected, and of course this doesn't even end here.  
Apart from its inefficient (read: expensive to produce) economy, expenses of the Greek government simply are too high. They did raise taxes, but since their bureaucracy is too dysfunctional to get tax withdrawal under control, this again hits a part of the population disproportionally, not quite incidentally the same people who already suffer the most.  
So, if they can't raise revenues sufficiently, they have to cut expenses. Ideally this would be actual waste, but again, this is difficult and insufficient, so we're back at what the government has direct influence over through a relatively simple legislative measure, and that's cutting pensions and other parts of the social net, the salary of public employees, and laying off those public employees directly, yet again hitting the same people that already suffer the most.

All this still isn't enough, or it takes much too long to have an effect, so Greece needs outside funding. The private sector is out, for obvious reasons, and those who still hold Greek debt will have to take that 70% cut (there's a bit more to it -- the bigger the expected cut, the cheaper it is to buy existing Greek bonds, and there's an ever growing share of those bonds being held by hedge funds that have ""insured"" themselves with credit default swaps against a Greek default, and they have an interest in the negotiations failing). This leaves the Troika (EU, ECB, IMF) with those favorable loans mentioned above.

But wait, there's more! Even if you disregard the social problems, those cuts have a very direct negative effect on the size of the Greek economy, which in turn means that the Greek government has a lower tax base it can draw revenues (taxes) from, and they most certainly won't solve the problem that there isn't much in terms of Greek exports that could get cheaper in the first place. Tourism is an important one (yes, tourism is an export), but as a German I don't think a vacation in Greece would be such a great idea at the moment. What Greece needs is investment, but apart from aforementioned general issues there now is a significant risk of economic collapse and devaluation, so the private sector won't do that, either, the Greek government can't, which again leaves other countries.

Unfortunately, there are several reasons why they can't provide the money for investment, either. Some of those are economic, they already had to take on a lot of debt after that other financial crisis and there's the very real possibility that they will have to make more money available for other countries that are on the brink, not to mention their own financial systems in case things go wrong -- incidentally, this is the same reason why they provide money at all, because not doing so would be even more expensive.  
There also are political reasons. The bailouts after the previous crisis didn't just cost money, but what is referred to as political capital. If the crisis spreads further, Greece would have set a precedent that other troubled countries would use as a template. Finally, if they risk the rise of populist anti-EU parties that would cancel payments altogether, with extremely negative effects for everybody, and the images of violent protests and strikes in Greece don't really help in this regard. I think that Greeks underestimate the domestic policy issues the other countries face just as much as the people in those countries underestimate the effect those austerity measures actually have on ordinary Greek citizens. Yes, they should turn to their upper class first, but that their bureaucracy to dysfunctional to do that is precisely one of Greek's problems.

Yes, this pretty much means that Greece is fucked. Disorderly default is pretty much the only thing that would be even worse. You can think of the austerity measures as chemo therapy -- many of those cuts and reforms are actually necessary, but there are profound negative effects as well. It's not guaranteed to work, but the alternative would be death. In a way, the lack of realistic alternatives gives Greek politicians the cover they need to even make those reforms.  
Most of all, this is about gaining time. In case the shit eventually hits the fan, the other troubled countries need the time to get their own act together, and the financial sector has to reduce exposure, to minimize contagion. Greece needs time to enact reforms, which they need either way, but that would be even more difficult after total collapse when even more people would be affected.  
*If* we make it through this phase and the European economy stabilizes, then it may be possible for the other countries to jump in and provide financing to Greece for it to build up a proper economy, or at least cut some of Greece's debt. However, even now the standard of living in Greece is still a lot higher than in some other EU countries, and they would rightfully claim to get their fair share as well.",0,1329149111,null,0,false,0,c3qs0nx,t3_pnbme,t1_c3qs0nx,t1_c3qqyh2,null,1428346051,508,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,508

What happens in Italy, for example, is that they give you a 6-month trial (or ""project"") contract that pays you peanuts. You don't have any right, you can't get sick (otherwise the contract won't be renewed), you can't protest against whatever fuckup you have to deal with. You basically have the same dignity of a medieval peasant.

At the end of the 6 months, they *might* hire you (if you've been a good dog). Or they might just as well kick you out.

Ideally after so many 6-month contracts (I think it's 10?) they should hire you. What really happens is that either they give you a job cash in hand, under the table, that doesn't show anywhere, or they just kick you out and hire someone younger, and good luck to you.

It's a lovely situation. I'm so happy I moved out of the country again for the second time in 5 years and I'm now in Hungary. Being in a nation in which the far right is on the rise and the government has basically completed a coup d'etat is better than being in my country.

Greece is already poor. It owes hundreds of billions.
&gt;One is that the EU transforms itself into some sort of political union with joint debt guarantees or a shared tax base or something like that. If that happens, then wealth will be automatically redistributed so the quality of life in Greece will not fall too far behind.

I don't think this will happen in the near future, especially after the Germans hearing of the retirement age for public workers. Greece (and many others) have been basically having a high standard of life on borrowed money. Now, with the lack of trust in the finance sector, no one is willing to borrow anyone without a high premium. 
&gt;A second option is for the Greeks to decide not to put up with this any more. If that happens, all bets are off. It's uncertain how Greece would be punished. The only certain thing is that initially the quality of life in Greece will fall much faster than today. But in the long term, depending on how foreign relations and the global economy turns out it may be a better scenario than the original one (but not the previous one).

True. In long term this might be good. But it would be good only because there will be no more debt.

There are not many employers at the moment, and the situation will worsen especially with the added crazy taxes.

What is more, numerous employers at the moment manage to get people sign up part-time, while they have them work full time. And of course no one is crazy enough to complain and risk losing their job since there is (not literally!) a queue of potential workers waiting to be hired.

The big problem of the lefts is that I see two trends: in the first, lefties are struck in the 1950s, in which security can only be achieved by comprehensive central planning and stable jobs. In the second, lefties are chaotically trying to make some sense of the changes by shouting some fashionable words (""GREEN ECONOMY!"" or ""EQUALITY!"") without actually questioning whether they fit well with their other proposed policies, and discounting any mistake by saying that ""at least we're better than the right"".

It shouldn't work that way. The left should stand for protecting the small man. Granting everyone the same right. That's what equality should mean, not that an immigrant from Bangladesh is the same as your 100% local kid: that is not true, and paves the way for discrimination (""if he's different then it's his fault!"") or for an sad loss of opportunity (ever been in Australia? to me, it looked like they too the best ideas off their European, Asian and American immigrants and mixed them together with national pride).

It's a sad day for progressism everywhere the one in which if you apply Adam Smith by the book (not that Chicago school nonsense), you have much more radical and egalitarian policies than those trumpeted by most ""left"" politicians out there.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"The remaining 30% of debt still owned by the private sector, if negotiations end successfully, will be converted to 30 year bonds, at (probably) 3.5%. The two bailouts total €240bn, at similar interest rates. Greece's GDP last year was €218 billion. (Edit: Plus the bonds held by the ECB, but there might be a bit of a relief here once the situation stabilizes, since the ECB only payed 70% of nominal value on average.) The goal is to get debt down to 120% by 2020, and that's optimistic. So, a decade from now, Greece will theoretically still pay some 4% of GDP for interest on its debt alone. I'm not sure if dragging this out for another generation or two would be such a good idea.

However, a lot could change until then. It's possible that we'll have a much more integrated EU by then, with a large budget that would pay for a lot of expenses that individual countries now have to carry themselves. The tricky part will be to get a decent amount of money into Greece without Eurosceptics going nuts over permanent transfer payments, or treating countries with a lower standard of living than Greece too unfairly. One possible way would be to increase the EU infrastructure and cohesion fund payments (those aren't loans, and already in the billion range for Greece).

That's a later phase, though. Nothing in terms of further European integration will happen as long as voters in the core countries fear that such steps could lead to decisions made in Athens, Lisbon or Rome (but mainly Athens) negatively affecting their standard of living.  
Put differently, Eurobonds could solve the sovereign debt issue practically over night, but the thinking goes that the Greek government would then lack the incentive to pass reforms, and that this would make substantial transfer payments permanent.  
I believe that it's in principle possible to convince the public in the core countries to accept more significant transfer payments, but only after the situation has stabilized and if member states have given up enough sovereignty over the final say on their budgets to guarantee that something like this will never happen again.",0,1329202640,null,0,true,0,c3r1l1v,t3_pnbme,t1_c3r1l1v,t1_c3r05u8,null,1428350629,17,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,17

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"It's... complicated. In theory, a cheaper euro would make Eurozone exports more competitive, so there would be more jobs, and the economy would grow.

The main problem is that it's against German orthodoxy, which is *still* very much influenced by the Weimar Hyperinflation, and that makes it difficult. Giving up the DM was a very unpopular step, and now that the worst fears appear to become reality, *devaluing* the euro artificially would have serious political consequences. The current government coalition, which is troubled enough as it is, would almost certainly collapse, and a German government crisis with a possible rise of a populist anti-EU party in Germany is the last thing we need right now (though conditions might change after the elections at the end of next year). And Germany isn't even entirely alone with this very conservative attitude towards monetary policy.  
One concern is that such a step would lead to higher interest rates. If you use devaluation as a policy, then the risk of you doing it again will be priced into interest rates for long term bonds. The public would perceive it as transfer payments by other means.

For Greece, the effect would be minimal. They export goods valued about €14bn per year outside of the Eurozone. If those exports would rise by 10%, it would still only be half a percent of GDP.

I think it would be more realistic to increase the ECB's inflation target. Currently it's at 2%, there's no good reason why it shouldn't be twice that. Still not exactly a popular move in Germany, but it would be more effective because then debt would shrink relative to GDP.

Everywhere in the world, he said, students were leftists. It was only in Hungary that we had met a conformist and fascist youth.

Which proves this guy is utterly clueless and out of touch. Hungarian and Western students share generally the same kind of anti-globalist, anti-consumerist, even anti-capitalist sentiments. The difference is that it pretty much seems like that the globalist-corporate-consumerist culture was engineered by the socialist and liberals in Hungary (it can be debated, but it at least _seems_ so), and thus naturally the resistance against it comes out on the right-wing side in the sense that reinventing Christianity as a bulwark against a ""Mammon"" culture of consumption, a strong focus on national identity as defense against globalisation / globalism and so on. 

It is the same anti-Israel, pro-Palestine sentiment as with Western (leftist) radicals except that Hungarian (nationalist) radicals don't  care about PC and openly notice the Israelis are, well, Jews, it is the same anti-American and anti-Neocon sentiment as with Western (leftist) radicals except that Hungarian (nationalist) radicals don't care about PC and openly notice the Neocons tend to be Jews too, it is the same anti-investor, anti-Wall Street, anti-banker sentiment, except for the same thing again. 

It is ""identity politics"" just the same way as the Western Left plays ""identity politics"" with gays  and minorities, except that they play ""identity politics"" with majority white Hungarian Christians. 

It is the same anti-greed sentiment as in the OWS, and a focus on higher community values than greed, except that it is combined with anti-lust, anti-hedonism as well (gays, drugs) because these too are seen as community-destroying much like greed, as they both seem to put the desires of the individual before the values of the community.

It is the same anti-corporate environmentalism as with the Western Left except that the typically environmentalist reinvention of older, more nature-friendly ways of the old villagers goes hand in hand with the reinvention of the morals and cultures of the old villagers, and so on.

I don't actually agree with them (I am more of a moderate conservative) but one thing every intelligent and honest observer give to them is that Hungarian nationalist-radical student radicalism is exactly the same thing as Western leftist-radicalism except that it is more _consistent_ in every way - as explained above.",0,1329212452,null,0,false,0,c3r2gz6,t3_pnj76,t1_c3r2gz6,t3_pnj76,null,1428351166,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

So, it's all the bigwhigs, the sun would shine over Greece if there weren't a few select badboys who crashed it? Guess what: Even if that is true, and I don't think so, the Greeks are all in it together. A few select crashed us in 1945, and we were all in it together, and rebuilt. With foreign help, btw, that is dwarved by what we have paid to Greece by now.

&gt; They work more hours per year than the germans.

It's not about hours worked, it is about productivity gained.

&gt; And it is not that the EU or Germany has tried to prevent the desaster before the rating agency mentioned those problems.

Right. We started working on this when it became our problem. I can only imagine the outcry had we started controlling them in '05.

&gt;  How about germany gets it shit together?

It seems to me that we are doing fine.

&gt; Germany could stop selling arms to Greece.

Greece should stop trying to buy arms. The problem is not whom they give their debts, but that they do it. Nothing will change when we stopp sending them our toys and they go straight away to the US or to Russia.

&gt; Germany could give Greece money after the bankrupcy instead of indirectly re-financing the no.1 creditor Deutsche Bank.

Yeah ... give the black credit card to your teenage spending-spree daughter. We have stopped writing blanco cheques after 1914...

&gt; How are they supposed to create new jobs by being unable to make investments?

Frankly, the debtors don't care. I do see, however, that Greece has close to 30% of it's facilities controlled by the state. How about selling, for example, the airline?
