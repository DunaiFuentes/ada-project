Now, when you look at what's happening in Europe, and you see Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Ireland struggeling, and proclaim all of this is happening because they have a lack of fiscal discipline, you're not a brilliant economist. It is my understanding that why it isn't literally Germany's 'fault', these countries enmassed unsustainable deficits because they are determined to more than Germany and Germany, more precisly its wage policy, plays an important role in this determination. I also believe that Germany, thanks to the Eurozone did obtain an advantage at the cost of the so called 'periphery'.

Its great to travel without border controls, its good for the economy to operate within a free market and certain regulations and standardizations are very helpful to the producer and the customer. 

But, and here is the problem, the EU is essentially a construct designed by politicans. Its parlament holds very little real power, its organization and decision-making processes are very complicated and not very democratic. It also lacks a clear goal, a message if you will. 

Do we want a United States of Europe? Or a united economic zone? Nobody ever bothered to ask the Germans these questions, and nobody gave a clear answer, let alone a plan to achieve one of the two, or explained why it is necessary.

Your average german comes into contact with the EU when a new law is passed by our legistlative bodies, that came from the European Comission. These laws usually concern enviromental problems or privacy matters and are therefore not very popular. This is one of the reasons that the EU is viewed as bureaucratic monster, which concerns itself with unnecessary or even harmful matters.

Another thing that should be taken into consideration is that we spent our last ten years liberating our economy. German employees made huge sacrifices in terms of job security, higher incomes and bonus payments. The actual income (i.e. adjustet for inflation) of the average German actually dropped over the last ten years. This is one of the factors that helped Germany to come so well out of the financial crisis of 2008. 

And now, after all these years of hardship are finally, very slowly paying off, there comes Greece. Now this is very polemic but certain newspapers in Germany paint your average Greek as someone who works maybe 20-25 hours a week, gets a huge salary out of it and goes into retirement and age 50. 

Many of us are asking the same question: Why should we, who are constantly told by our politicans that we simply don't have the money to lower taxes, to provide better schools and daycare for our children and to implement a better health care system, suddenly spent billions on dollars for a country that is essentially responsible for its own misery?

For the past two decades, Germany has been pursuing an export oriented economic strategy based upon stagnant domestic wages.  Recent attacks upon the welfare state, such as the Schroeder government's Hartz reforms, were an attempt to consolidate this course.  

What Germany needs to do is reorient towards invigorating domestic demand (i.e. raising wages) so that it is not so dependent upon export markets for its economic well-being.

However, the current government under Merkel sees no reason to mess with the current export-oriented strategy, and that's exactly why the current government's prescription of austerity for the European periphery is met with such bafflement by outsiders.  Germany appears to be trying to strangle itself economically.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; Or, why would they make monetary union in the first place? The answer is, people don't think. Nor do they at the top.

No, the answer is that, for the core countries, it was much more about national security and political symbolism than about economics. It was about making the economical entanglement described in the Schuman Declaration irreversible, in light of the German Reunification. Germany went from being about the same size as France to again becoming the largest nation in the center of Europe, and for Mitterand, who was born during WWI, this cause concerns. He wasn't as vocal about it as Thatcher, but he had reservations, and since the Potsdam Agreement was still in force, this carried a lot of weight. Before that, Germany had tried to make a political and financial union a precondition for a common currency -- because the problems with a currency union without the necessary fiscal union to go with it were well understood.  
Political union was supposed to be worked on afterwards. But why push for something that's unpopular with the voters if you've already got the reward?

There are other effects they had hoped to gain from the euro; it was supposed to help shape a European identity, and maybe become an alternative to the dollar as the major reserve currency. Most economic advantages, like the removal of exchange rate risk, could have been achieved by freezing exchange rates.

**€5bn.**  

There was a catch to it though, a couple of years later they had to pay it back or it would be €10bn.  That was the Goldman Sach's payoff. 

Do you know how much the Greek GDP went up above the previous financial year's positive growth rate the first year in the Euro?

**2%.**

They missed one of the ERMII somewhat arbitrary windows of expectation by a slither, and whether morally right or wrong, knowing that from the extra revenue they'd make in the first year alone it was worth turning a blind eye, worth it for both Goldman Sachs and Greece.  

**Do you know there was already a precedent before Greece for showing a little flexibility?**  Italy didn't technically qualify for the Euro either.  Since then France in the last 10 years has dropped out of the ERMII rate 7 times, which it is still obliged to stay in.  Germany, 5 times.

€5bn is nothing.  It certainly hasn't caused the crisis.  Make Goldman and Morgan Stanley, who was also in the deal, pay back their profits by all means, punish them even, but there's no way they created the Greek crisis.  

Problem being, Greece didn't pay the installments back.  They made the extra money; they just didn't collect the tax on the extra revenue they made, or pay back the obligation they'd accepted with the high interest rate, even if it was comparatively small.

Do you also know that in 2010-2011 had Greece collected just 40% of the year's outstanding tax it would have balanced its deficit?  Not just pulled it back the -3% to inside the ERM: balanced it.  So if they'd have collected just 50%, they'd have been able to pay off their debts as opposed to running up even more.

Do you also know that the 'German' imposed austerity still leaves Greece with a lower average tax burden, per capita, than the average German? 

**Did you also know that Greece last balanced its budget in the early 70s?**  That it has been running a deficit ever since?

Did you also know that when the crisis hit Greece both the farmers, who are one of the biggest net recipients from the CAP in the EU, went on strike for another €1bn in subsidy, and tax inspectors went on strike?

Did you also know that the forecasts are that if Greece were to accept austerity, begin collecting its debts, and stay in the Euro, then in 10years time it will have reduced its debt to pre-crisis levels? - As it is we're hearing reports of Greeks separating their families so at least someone amongst them can leave the country indefinitely.

But a lot of europeans do speak english, and I imagine all the major politicians in the EU council or whatever can speak at least moderately good english. It seems irrelevant to me though, as we have UK politicians representing our country there, and I imagine we have a large say in the lawmaking.

I like how you criticise me for lumping you with daily mail readers because of your views while simultaneously lumping me with guardian readers because of mine. Hypocritical much? So apparently I supported Stalin and Mao? Well for one, I am neither chinese nor russian. Secondly, I doubt I was alive during their reign. Thirdly, I don't read the Guardian. While I agree with a lot of it's views they are just as blatantly biased as the daily mail, and it makes my stomach churn when I see stories so blatantly twisted to promote a specific viewpoint. I want the facts as straight as possible so I can decide for myself.

This kind of hyperbolic personal attack (I'm pro-EU, so clearly i support genocidists... right) is so typical of your type and is why I find difficulty sympathising with the british political right. When you argue about a point, it always seems over-the-top, irrational and fueled by personal biases.

 I don't think it's right to play the bigot card every time someone is against the EU... you have a right to your own political views and I imagine there are some very good arguments for independence. You made some good points from what I can see (as I said, I'm no expert on international relations and finance) but mostly that's not the case - the arguments are weak and the views seem to have come from xenophobia rather than political understanding. Admittedly, I'm just as much a hypocrite as you as my views on the EU definitely stem from my good experiences with europe and europeans, and my absence of 'british pride'. But as objectively as possible, pro-EU arguments usually seem to come from a place of clear-headed rationale and a focus on the benefits, while pro-independence arguments usually come from a place of rationalizing xenophobia. It's always 'I don't want some foreigner who doesn't even speak english running my country' or some such rhetoric and hyperbole.

 So, even though I don't fully understand the issues being discussed, I'm going to side with the guys making good points and arguing rationally over the guys flinging insults and exaggerations every time.

Germany was the first to break the budget deficit rules. Germany's debt continues to be above the agreed limit. If such a big economy can't follow the rules it agreed to, then what does this say about the design of the Eurozone?

Also, why do we let private bankers getting away, while we are footing the bill?

The failure of the Eurozone is not only Germany's fault.

I am Swiss, living part-time in Germany, and have an inherent distrust of anything resembling political incorporation in Europe - I _like_ the idea of independence, lots of voting, tax competition, etc., because I think it keeps governments on their toes.

That said, the European institutions that make doing business easier are brilliant.  Erasmus, Schengen, consistent numbering of highways, train and air route synchronization, even things like standardization of power sockets (which the Swiss still haven't done, grr), these all make life much easier and advance the goal of peace by making people trade with each other.  

Even the Euro, with all its flaws, is a good thing for this (although the fact that France and Germany flouted the Stability and Growth Pact, the ECB didn't have the necessary control mechanisms for possible failures, and nobody bothered to seriously audit members or enforce failures to adhere to stated rules).

I thoroughly sympathize with the Germans.  The country made _huge_ sacrifices in the 1990s, both with East Germany, and with the transition from an industrial economy (which large regions still haven't really made).  Savings rates are high, debt is low, infrastructure is good, education functions, and generally it exhibits most of the elements you'd expect of a generally well-working country. 

The thing is, Germany _still_ hasn't gotten over the costs of incorporating the East.  If you look at whole areas of the Ruhr, they are, pardon me, derelict shitholes.  Money that should have been used for investment in parts of the country that were functioning well prior to de-industrialization, with trained workers, good transportation, and well developed infrastructure, have been left to go to shit because the funds were sent East.  No wonder so many Germans are pissed about seeing this basically repeated with Greece.

Germany is the weakest link here, because all the movies and TV series are dubbed, but *most* speak it well enough for you to get by, and many will jump at the opportunity to have a conversation with a native speaker. But don't let this keep you from learning a new language. Generally, this is always a good idea.

Smuggling weed, on the other hand, isn't. The odds are in you favor, but the risk/reward calculation isn't, especially not as a non-resident. Trafficking is not the same as possession, and this has the potential to ruin your experience. AFAIK, Scandinavian countries are pretty restrictive when it gets to weed, and you'll have to pass through Denmark on the way from Germany to Sweden, but there is some risk even at the Dutch/German border, and as a 19 year old foreign tourist, customs knows you're more likely to bring weed with you than the grandma who lives in the border region. The borders are open for people and (legal) goods, but they can perform random checks for drugs and weapons in border regions and on long distance traffic routes, which includes cross-border trains and railway stations.  
It's not rare that customs officers will walk through the train and ask random passengers from where to where they're travelling. Can you keep cool when you're thrown in a situation where you're in a foreign country and a customs officer approaches you while you've got weed in your pocket? Only few people can. In theory, a passing dog won't smell well packaged weed that is stacked in the luggage compartment above the seats, but the next level of escalation is that they ask if you have any drugs or weapons with you, and then if you'd mind to show them your bag. You *will* get visibly nervous at this point at the latest.  
I don't know what happens if they find it on you as a non-resident. They probably don't think you'll stick around and wait for a trial, and they have no way of enforcing any sentence, even a fine, once you're back home. The state attorney or a judge can let you go for lack of public interest if it's a small amount, but a customs officer has to go by the book or s/he risks an obstruction of justice charge. Also, this means they have to do the paper work, so they will be annoyed if you bother them with your attempt at petty smuggling.

There's probably somebody on /r/trees who has gone through this, but be warned that a lot of it depends on the country. Also, be wary of any advice you'll get there about how to dog-proof your weed. 99% of dog-proofing advice you'll get from other potheads is bullshit. Dogs don't mind at all if it's air-tight, and you can't ""cover up"" the smell. You need to get as much mass around it as possible, and there can't be any traces you still had on your hands on the outside.

You can improve the odds if you take local public transport across the border, but really, I'd advise you to instead source it upon arrival from the locals you'll get to know there.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"It's not ""slavery"" if you have a say in the matter. That's the whole point. Without federalization to remove the possibility that even a relatively small member can cause severe economic instability in all of the currency union and beyond, governments have almost no incentive to put the long term stability of the union before their own short term political interests. I've most recently explained this in more detail [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/vg8rk/in_other_words_as_far_as_underlying_economic/c54gq1w?context=3). As it is, one member can fuck up royally and the others have no choice but to pick up the tab if they don't want to risk a much bigger bill when the fallout cascades through our interwoven financial system. It can't remain like this in the long term.

It's much better, cheaper and yes, fairer, to accept that you simply can't have a currency union without some kind of system for internal transfers, and demand measures that prevent individual members from fucking up as royally as we've seen in *some*, by no means all, of the currently troubled countries.  

This would serve three main purposes, apart from avoiding the political bickering we see these days. One is that internal transfers are needed to replace the correcting effects that normally would happen through changes of the exchange rates. Another is that it's a form of investment into a common future, we need to build up the weaker economies so they can catch up to the stronger ones, which would be good for everybody. I don't think those countries can easily do this on their own, even with the EU's structural and cohesion funds the way they are now, not in a post-crisis Eurozone that won't at all be the way it used to be. Without federalization, they will never have the same kind of access to cheap capital that they used to have in the pre-crisis Eurozone.

Finally, automatic transfers in the form of, say, a banking union or a common fund for unemployment benefits, would break feedback loops in case a member gets into trouble in the way Spain did, for example. Here we have a country that had low debt and even ran budget surpluses, but what happened after their housing bubble burst and people in the construction sector lost their jobs was that the government suddenly had to deal with several huge interdependent cost factors: Loss of tax revenue, cost for unemployment benefits, bank bailouts, and raising interest rates on government debt. Banks had to deal with loans going bad, so they had difficulties to lend. Companies couldn't get credit, so they couldn't invest and hire new people, and revenues went down because of the overall bad economic situation, so people lost their jobs, which meant they couldn't pay their loans, which caused troubles for the banks, and so on. Then add to this that trust in the banking system and the government's ability to guarantee deposits is eroding, which means people move their capital elsewhere, which is bad for the banks, so they have problems giving credit and need to get bailed out. People not getting credit means that they can't afford to buy a house if if the wanted to, which means the housing crisis gets worse, which is bad for the banks, and so on.  
But if we had a banking union, there would be no need for people to move their deposits elsewhere, and if we had a common fund for unemployment benefits, the government would only have to deal with the loss of tax revenue, and so on.",0,1340620785,null,0,false,0,c558y9p,t3_vjczg,t1_c558y9p,t1_c5587q2,null,1429224201,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

net neutrality, as i understand it, is there to ensure equal *access* to information. nobody owns the internet, therefore property rights aren't affected. providers are paid bandwidth, not content. 

net neutrality is there to ensure that telcoms, whose business it is to provide the infrastructure and the services to communicate on the internet, do not restrict or distort the access to said content. so no, the property is not being infringed upon by net neutrality.

just imagine if your telephone company (in most cases the same party that delivers your internet access) restricted the range of numbers you could call on your telephone. want to call grandma? thats an extra $5! 
same thing on the internet: your provider should not have the right to charge you a premium for something thatdoesnt require them more effort to produce. this has nothing to do with them charging for bandwidth - technical expenses should obviously be paid.

Yes, we need to fix the problems in the framework and strengthen institutions. If we do this without a political union, how would you reconcile stricter rules and more powerful institutions with the views on the democratic deficit that I assume you have?

&gt; it's not possible to break up the euro in a way that would be even remotely orderly.

With the aid of the IMF/World bank and a massive devaluation of the nations that leave the Euro it could work. The fallout would mostly be political and deepen hostilities between those in and outside the various clubs.

If Greece were to write off its debt it'd be fine in 5-10 years. That would ruin most of the banks that lent foolishly which of course would have a big knock on effect to Germany (and the UK) but then that's what should happen when banks lend foolishly.

So it's something like Germany, known as the sick man of Europe, kept a firm lid on wages whilst the world economy grew. At the same time, a lot of money from the core in Europe flowed into the periphery, pushing up wages and costs. Asset prices started to rise as more money flowed into these new euro economies. Weak borrowers were allowed collateralized loans. Capital goods and what not (from germany) are purchased to fuel growth in the periphery. Cue the financial crisis.

The money starts flowing out. Asset prices fall which leads to a banking crisis. Wages being sticky make an internal devaluation not easily done. It becomes apparent that the patterns of trade are not sustainable.

It's about loving your country and everything that is great about it. This includes the democratic and legal processes, independence, history, culture and self-sufficiency, all of which are slowly being eroded away by Europeans and foreign influences.

On the subject of ""brownies"", it's true that multiculturalism has failed. Immigrants need to conform to British culture or it just won't work. British people should not bend to their rules.

&gt;But that's not going to go anywhere just because we decide too work together with our neighbouring countries.

It isn't merely working together with foreign countries, it's actually integrating with them. It means using a foreign legal system, a foreign constitution and allowing foreigners to run this country. Great Britain has survived hundreds of years as an independent nation, there is no reason why we should bend down to a foreign power.

&gt;I don't see what trade law has to do with culture.

It's about independence, there is no reason why Britain shouldn't be able to trade internationally for itself.

&gt;It just seems to me that anti-EU sentiments seem to be motivated by either animosity towards foreigners, or some kind of misplaced pride of Britain as an independent island, standing proud and alone. 

It is not misplaced in the slightest.

&gt;But it seems to me that most people who are pro-british independence don't either, and the argument is usually 'we don't want no fuckin' brussel sprouts runnin our country from abroad' without any discourse about what's actually beneficial or harmful to our country (or any interest in helping our neighbours).

People who want British independence know what they're talking about, otherwise they wouldn't want independence. This thread is filled with countless arguments against being in the EU.

A fiscal union requieres a new constitution in Germany, because the constitutional court won't allow such under the current constitution. (Germans will follow the great french tradition and create a new republic once in a while. The 6th republic for France and the 3rd one in Germany:)

&gt;&gt; the Europe of the future will not be a federal state based on the model of the United States of America or the Federal Republic of Germany. It will have its own structure. It's an extremely exciting venture.

A new european parliament has two bodies. One directly elected, the other with representatives of their countries (Senat). This brings new democratic legitimation.

Every European country is invited to participate. It might happen sooner, than some might expect.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Which is why I said you can only really use public debt in this context, because of course the UK with large external debt also has fiscal autonomy over its own currency.  Greece has a lot of external debt stretching back to the early 1990s, it can't however control the Euro.  The reason why the UK has so much external debt and why it can still get such comparably low rates on its government bonds is because people know the UK is still in control, even the USD leveraged as a reserve currency doesn't have that sort of autonomy.  It's also why, when the IMF released a report on Europe saying the governments must find an extraordinary and additional means of dealing with the crisis, it singled out the UK government having gone through austerity and still having its own currency as still having some strings to its bow; namely QE and interest rates.

^* Added to that small countries tend to have higher overseas debt, financial economies, tend to have high overseas debt.  Britain has a disproportionate GDP for its size and it's the number one financial centre in the world.  Like you say, external debt only shows one side of the issue and any country with a disproportionately big financial sector is going to have liabilities and securities as part of that sector.  As such comparing UK external debt as a ratio of GDP has no correlation with any other country - certainly not within Europe where the next biggest financial sector is Frankfurt at 13^th in the world.  London is comparable to New York, but the UK and US GDPs aren't comparable.  UK overseas debt as a percentage is comparable to Hong Kong, especially when you consider the strength of the pound, but then Hong Kong's size as a state isn't comparable to the UK either.  You can only really derive one thing from the UK's high overseas debt ratio: that it has one hell of a financial sector.  That on its own is it.  

That and it's useful to use as a means of putting the fear of God into someone who doesn't understand what it implies but is self-confident and unaware enough to think 'debt divided by money coming in' can only mean one thing.  It's a specious talking point.

Any meaningful comparison has to be public debt versus GDP, and of the big 4 European economies,  France, Germany, Italy and the UK, the UK has the lowest ratio.

I don't see how the EU can erode our history. Especially as our history largely involves fucking and fighting with people from europe. I know which one I'd rather be doing. As for culture, well, it is a dichotomy. On the one hand I think it's great for people to be able to experience a vast variety of cultures. However it is difficult to enable this without enabling globalization and the slow transform of the world into one big undefined culture. But with the internet that is difficult to prevent anyway. Should we go the route of North Korea and shut off access to the rest of the world completely to preserve worship of our great and wonderful leader The Queen? I personally like that I will be able to just grab my stuff and drive across to mainland Europe and live there for as long as I like. Personally, I don't see the appeal of our culture.

I can't say I would mind if we got a bit more of that in England! Sounds like fun to me.

The fact is, Britain has been a cultural melting pot for aeons. We eat indian food, drive japanese cars, watch american TV and use Finnish phones. I doubt a few european trade laws are going to make any dramatic difference to our culture. England has a rich history, but most self-proclaimed patriots could name the players in a Spanish football team way quicker than they could 11 British Monarchs or Inventors. I want to live in a country that is patriotic because of it's progressive values, acceptance of other cultures, and its contributions to the world other than how we kicked nazi arse back in '45, not because we happened to be born here and well, foreigners can suck it.

That's somewhat arguable, the UK has stood against ID cards for example, something that Germany embraces and whilst things like CCTV are problematic their private use is just as badly regulated in Germany (and Germany makes use publicly too). 

The point of course is that whilst in Germany you will look at things through the lens of a constitution, in the UK the whole body of law is seen as the constitution and so weighed internally.  I don't think that's a bad thing (and both countries have significant judicial oversight for excessive legislation).

true,socrates28,null,null,"Sorry a small response to your post sprawled into a more general post, hope you don't mind :)

This is true, but I feel like the main crux of this issue is whether or not the EU as it stands now, and as it will following its ideological, institutional, political, economic maturation, as the best way to become a bigger economy. 

Sure the EU may give them the edge, but the other side emerges when they ask, ""at what cost?"" And this is a fair issue, because for Europe to once again be a centre of power and influence in the world that can effectively compete with and challenge the US, China, and the rest of the BRIC countries, it needs to unite. And this is the point that I support, a unified Europe. On the other hand the shape and form of the EU, though it purports to pursue the goal of a unified Europe, is completely disagreeable. And this is an okay position to have, as the argument doesn't have to be automatically stratified into a choice between the EU or a everyone for themselves scenario. Furthermore, the inability to resolve the question of power distribution among member states, is a key point that I dislike about the EU. It has the potential for becoming a hijacked vehicle of the dominant economies, to exploit weaker economies while hoarding the wealth and power of this ""unified Europe"". In countries of the former USSR and the Soviet Bloc this is a serious issue, as decades of corruption in the management of formerly nationalized assets has shown that these countries are not at that level that Germany, France, or England are at, and these countries would love nothing more than to open up swathes of Europe for their personal domination. This may sound like a conspiracy theory, but it really isn't, when you see the amount of foreign influence in say Polish politics, business-life, and the sheer numbers of people migrating out of the country. 

Taking our Polish example, the period of 1945-1993 (Communism and the Transition Period) first drove Poland miles away from capitalism, liberalism, democracy and so on, and then in 1989-1993 shock therapy came, brought capitalism into the country and fixed everything. Well not really, the much lauded shock therapy was a series of crooked dealings that essentially broke up large amounts of nationalised assets into smaller units, gave them over to party members in some cases and in many completely destroyed industry areas (such as shipbuilding with the now troubled Gdansk Shipyards). So when the country joined in 2003 it was in a horribly weak state in comparison to Germany, which despite undergoing reunification with its own challenges at least had West Germany to keep a functioning capitalist economy and tradition alive for 1945-1989. Naturally there was the phenomenon of everybody immediately trying to go to the West to find work, the West buying up valuable assets in Poland for cheap to establish footholds in the country and so on, while indigenous capitalism suffered. 

The point is that Poland and other countries like it should never have been fully accepted into the EU, instead they should have been given limited memberships that limit what the EU can do to it, but in exchange for economic aid and temporary protection are given the ability to deal with their internal problems without Europe pouncing them. Sadly they weren't, and this is only one example of where the EU can be a bad thing, overrall a good thing, but in the specifics a bad thing. This is why I believe in an overhaul and reexamination of the concept of a unified Europe. Well before we do that let us first define what we want Europe, Europeans, and European Unity to look like.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well I am right, but you have to appreciate what it is I am saying I'm right about.  

All I'm saying is: **'Debt' in itself is neither a good or a bad thing, it depends on the nature of the debt, not the form in which the debt comes; be it financial, net, commercial, overseas, whatever.**  

So saying one country has more of one sort of debt, and less of another sort of debt, or more debt overall means nothing of itself.

Commercial debt is a business loan.  Commercial debt can either indicate a business is about to go bust or explode onto the market as the next big thing and see its share price rocket.  Looking at the level of commercial debt on face value means nothing.  Same goes for all other types of debt.

Presenting 'debt' as a default bad thing, or throwing a country's total debt into a pot and then comparing it to another country's total debt pot and trying to use that on its own as an argument doesn't work.  People might likewise think of 'surplus', the antithesis of debt,  as a good thing, yet in Catch 22 a surplus of cotton nearly kills Milo's business exploits.  

Just like debt, surplus can be both good and bad - so simply looking at debt and not appreciating that it means different things in different circumstances, to different countries, is fallacy. 

-----------

*To expand on the nature of the debt, if you're looking for something more comparable, the markets have a meter for it, sovereign credit default swaps (CDS), assessing the nature of debt:*

To put it into that context, with **the higher the rate the more risky or the less confidence there is in it**, the nature of the sovereign CDS of France is down 13.8% on the year at 191.58 on the index, Germany is down 4.18% on the year at 99.0 on the index, the UK is down *26.57%* on the year at *71.59* on the index rate.  Italy is up 0.5% on the year but at 505.72  (Bloomingberg).

http://workforall.net/CDS-Credit-default-Swaps.html

The financial markets actually rate UK debt as as not only better than the big EU states, they're looking on it as increasingly more favourable over time!  Which is why the UK is one of only several EU countries, and easily one of the largest, which still has a AAA rating with a registered 'Stable' outlook.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_credit_rating#Ratings

You can put all the UK debt into the debt-fruit smoothie maker and have it come out as some sort of Hulk, but when you take into consideration the nature of that debt, all that debt, the UK smoothie currently looks like one the more desirable - which is actually grounds for why the UK can now afford if anything goes wrong to actually go down the Quantitative Easing route before hoisting the flag upside down.

There are several factors for this:

1. Investors think that we're going to see severe deflation.

2. Investors don't think (at present) that the UK will have to bailout its banks again, so they see the sovereign debt as safe.

They're wrong on both counts. Firstly, the BoE will print more money to keep nominal asset prices up. There's no way the MPC will allow deflation. It's not yet politically acceptable to print freely, but it will be shortly. Secondly, once the second mass bailout has taken place, UK debt is not exactly going to be seen as a safe haven. Most likely cash will move into the dollar and treasury bills as well as traditional safe-havens such as gold, silver, and other precious metals. Liquidity will not be the issue next time as it was post-Lehman. The issue will be (is) insolvency.

And by the same measure investors themselves can offset asset price deflation; case in point lower CDS rates can improve liquidity.

&gt;Quite, but I'm saying that our banking system is in worse shape than any other. We're the worst of a pretty bad bunch.

Yet whilst the investors disagree with you, as well as the credit rating agencies, there isn't a problem, and whilst there isn't a problem what you're saying won't come about.  All the markets are actually saying that the UK is in considerably better shape than many others.  It's not that the British banking system is in a worse shape, it's clearly not, it's that if there is a banking crisis Britain stands to be affected not because of the state it's in, which is comparably quite good, but because of its sheer size - and it's preposterous to even start discussing that because there's nothing anybody can do about it, nor would they want to.

What the credit agencies are saying is that if the UK hadn't adopted severe austerity when it did then it's credit rating would be at far greater risk.  As it stands the UK still has a AAA rating - which is more than can be said for most.

You're right.  The UK is a nation of peasant farmers wholly unfamiliar with this thing called ""capitalism"" and our economy will be torn asunder by the rough-and-tumble American bullies.

Yes.  That's the problem.  The UK is being held back by the protectionist shrinking violets on the Continent.  The UK on the whole does see it as advantageous.  The fact that the rest of the EU does not only reinforces what most Britons know: that we have very little economically in common with the rest of the EU, and the protectionist members who are terrified of opening up their own markets to competition have far too much say in the direction that the EU is taking.

It still remains the same: a large market gets the best conditions in negotiating trade deals. That works for the same reason that big entities can succesfully boycott smaller entities, but not in the reverse.

The disadvantages of being a small market do not apply to the UK precisely because of their EU membership. Second, yes, being the smaller partner is disadvantageous. A big company might very well fund a takeover with its own funds; a smaller one wouldn't be able to do it without indebting itself or losing control.

I have no idea what you are talking about here, nor do I think you do, neither.  The UK's companies already compete on a global stage.  They aren't in any way protected from takeovers by American companies now despite there not being a free trade agreement with the US, nor do I understand why you are trying to link a free trade agreement with open war on our companies.

In fact, the UK's largest companies almost universally are owned by foreigners as it is, so your bizarre insistence that buy-outs of our companies by foreigners is something to be feared is even more strange.

&gt; More than half of the UK's trade is with the EU. How do you think that will be impacted if the UK would renegotiate all agreements with the EU?

It won't impact it as much as you are trying to imply.  WTO rules place strict limits on import levies that can be placed on goods by countries, not that I suspect in a million years that the likes of the Netherlands or Germany will suddenly start levying our exports should we choose to leave the EU.  The Germans are not going to suddenly stop buying our goods because we are outside of the Euroclub any more than the German refuse to buy Chinese goods because they are also outside.  That's just not how trade works.

&gt; You disagree with some choices other people make. How is that an argument against EU membership?

I made a small selection of quotes for you, mind that I'm much less acknowledged with Marx' politica writings so I had to use google for most of them.

*“The oppressed are allowed once every few years to decide which particular representatives of the oppressing class are to represent and repress them.”* ~ Marx

*""Marx and I, ever since 1845, have held the view that one of the final results of the future proletarian revolution will be the gradual dissolution and ultimate disappearance of that political organisation called the State; an organisation the main object of which has been to secure, by armed force, the economical subjection of the working majority to the wealthy minority.""* ~Engels

*""When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organized power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organize itself as a class; if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class. In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.""* ~ Marx

*""Just as the savage must wrestle with nature, in order to satisfy his wants, in order to maintain his life and reproduce it, so civilised man has to do it, and he must do it in all forms of society and under all possible modes of production. With his development the realm of natural necessity expands, because his wants increase; but at the same time the forces of production increase, by which these wants are satisfied. The freedom in this field cannot consist of anything else but of the fact that socialised man, the associated producers, regulate their interchange with nature rationally, bring it under their common control, instead of being ruled by it as by some blind power; that they accomplish their task with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most adequate to their human nature and most worthy of it.""* ~ Marx


*“People think they have taken quite an extraordinarily bold step forward when they have rid themselves of belief in hereditary monarchy and swear by the democratic republic. In reality, however, the state is nothing but a machine for the oppression of one class by another, and indeed in the democratic republic no less than in the monarchy.”* ~ Engels

Most of the present-day province of Namur, was part of the prince-bishopric. The county of Loon was rule by the bishop since 1366.

Even though ever since the Kreits there was the opportunity to form a common culture, it hardly happened. The towns in the Southern Netherlands were (and still are) notoriously particularistic. In particular no bilingual culture that went beyond individual efforts exists, as the split along language lines in more recent times proves. There are some minor things like beer that are spread widely enough and still particular enough to the Belgian territory to be considered Belgian. Those aren't sufficient by far, however, to speak of a Belgian culture in more than a footnote.

&gt;and the only reason we aren't 'Dutch' right now is because we're closer to Spain.

Well, there was better defensive terrain in the North.. more interestingly, Holland was more centralized and therefore better able to coordinate a war effort than the eternally quarrelling cities of Ghent and Antwerp.

true,briecheese1414,null,null,"I am not a Parisian unfortunately, but I can give you some advice on what to do! I studied abroad in southern France (Aix-en-Provence) and traveled to Paris several times for a total of about 3 weeks there. 

Firstly, if you are students make sure to bring your student card. Many places have decreased admission prices for students. I was a European Union student so I got in most places for free, but I'm pretty sure there are some nice discounts for other students. 

The absolutely most amazing thing I discovered in Paris was http://www.newparistours.com/daily-tours/paris-free-tour.html It is a four hour free walking tour that shows you all the most interesting parts of Paris and is extremely informative. I would suggest seeing Notre Dame first (and climbing up to the towers if you want to, it costs about 7.50 euros regular price) then crossing the river and meeting the tour in the Latin District. (If you want to do lunch first there are a fair number of “cheaper” food stands around the place where the tour starts.) This area is also a pretty good area for touristy type shopping. Where the tour ends is closer to the Eiffel Tower. I walked to the Eiffel Tower from that point (one of my favorite things to do in a city is get lost while still semi knowing where I am), it is a fairly long walk despite how close it looks. I never took any of their other tours, but I can imagine they are just as interesting as the free one (they really try and push them, because you actually have to pay for all the others). They have one of the Montmartre district (show you where a lot of famous painters and writers lived and their favorite spots) and the Versailles garden (the palace is gorgeous even though I didn’t go through the garden). 

Ok, so the must-sees of Paris are (apart from the things you see specifically on the tour):
- Inside Notre Dame, if you go up the tower there is a really pretty view of the city and an up-close view of the gargoyles.  The line to go up can get pretty long, so watch out for that! You could also sit in on a bit of a service depending on when you are at Notre Dame. You may not understand what they’re saying, but it’s still pretty cool. 
- The Louvre is a definite! http://www.louvre.fr/llv/musee/alaune.jsp?bmLocale=en I spent hours there just wandering and figuring out where I had ended up later. (of course I also had free admission so I went back about 5 times). Admission is free on the first Sunday of every month. Watch out, they are closed on Tuesday (In general make sure you know what days museums and monuments are closed because most of them are closed at least one day of the week.) On Wednesday and Friday nights they are open until 10 (they normally close at 6). When I was there they had reduced admission at this time, but I can’t currently find anything about it on the website, so ask your tour guide on the free tour. Either way, they museum is usually much less crowded during those times and the lines to get in are much smaller. Also, if you don’t go later at night and there is still a long line (there can be even in off-season) go to the Carrousel entrance (also go here if you want to see the famous upside down pyramid)http://www.louvre.fr/llv/pratique/venir.jsp?bmLocale=en . It takes you to the underground entrance. The gardens directly to the left in that picture is a great place to sit and have lunch (pretty much every bakery has sandwiches for not too expensive). As for what to see in the Louvre, that depends on your interests. The Mona Lisa is in a room with a bunch of other great artwork and some of my favorite paintings are in the room just behind it. Other than that, they have pretty great maps and an infinite number of rooms!
- The Champs Elysees is an awesome street with a lot of history. The shops are really expensive for the most part, but its fun to walk down it. A lot of car companies have showrooms here and its cool to see the upcoming styles if you are interested in that at all. (The Tyota place has free wi-fi too if you happen to need it, just ask one of the workers for the password.)
- The Arc de Triomphe is at the end of the Champs Elysees. While it is fairly expensive to go up (8 euros) and may not be worth it, it does have a really pretty view of Paris especially at night (and when the Eiffel tower sparkles on the hour, every hour past dark, as long as they haven’t changed it). 
- Sacre Coeur (sacred heart)- its located in my favorite Parisian neighborhood. Its one of the only parts of Paris that wasn’t re-done under Napolean in the “classic Parisian style” and the streets are really winding and confusing. What I did my first time was get off the metro at the Moulin Rouge stop (another iconic place) and simply try walking uphill to the church (Sacre Coeur is directly at the top.) You can also get off at another stop at the base of the hill and walk the steps or ride the tram up. This area is also a fairly cheap spot to eat and shop for touristy things. The church is absolutely gorgeous on the inside so make sure you go in! From this hill there is also a pretty good view of Paris! 
- Eiffel Tower (of course)- I would recommend buying your tickets online and printing them out beforehand. http://www.tour-eiffel.com/preparing-your-visit/buying-your-tickets You have to be there at a specific time (and if you’re not there at the time then they’re worthless) but you don’t have to wait in line forever (Since you are going during their bust season definitely do this). If you want to go to the top level go for it, but I don’t think its worth it, and its often closed due to wind or inclement weather. The second level is a much cooler view of Paris (the top level tickets gets you access to both levels). 
- Other things that you can see if you have time and want to are the Catacombs, Napolean’s Tomb, Pompideu center (modern art museum:http://www.centrepompidou.fr/Pompidou/Accueil.nsf/Document/HomePage?OpenDocument&amp;L=2) , 
- Verseilles is a great day trip from Paris and is a gorgeous old castle! You can pay a little more than the normal fare and take one of the metros out there. 
General tips for Paris:
- Many shops close on Sunday
- Make sure you have a map and especially a metro map! (the hotel will probably have one, but you might want to print one off to make sure you can easily get to your hotel)
- I would recommend getting as many metro tickets as you think you’ll need because some stops don’t have an easy way to get them. You can get them as single tickets, packs of 12 (I think) and unlimited by the day, 2 days, 3 days etc. The unlimited passes will give you the most freedom, but its up to you! Students ride for half price on the weekends (at least they did when I was there, and I believe that extends to foreign students as well)
- Get a crepe—Nutalla banana is my favorite (chocolatey stuff and banana), but they are all amazing
- Check out for these little guys:https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1214114085207&amp;set=a.1214099324838.2031644.1599450598&amp;type=1&amp;theater They are called space invaders. Its graffiti of a guy that now has gone world-wide and are found all over Paris. 
- Make sure you check out a list of festivals going on in Paris. Sometimes there are some really cool ones. 
- If you don’t want “total tourist” find one of the farmers markets and walk around. I love getting lost in Paris!

Do you speak any French? If you don't,  from my experience if you make any effort to talk in French at all they will be about 1000x nicer. Plus, mostly Parisians are rude to foreigners because most of the time foreigners are rude to them. Once in a shop in Paris I offered to translate for a shopkeeper and customer who were having difficulty communicating and the customer turned around and said “No, I’m teaching him a lesson because he needs to learn English” I stood there openmouthed and apologized to the shop keeper for Americans. If you enter a store and say “bonjour” to the shop keeper and “au revoir” when you leave they will probably (depends on the person obviously) treat you at least with almost as much respect as a native frenchman.

true,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"Well, yes, it does. You can have cat races that distinguish themselves from others merely by their fur colouring. Animal breeding uses the rather problematic word ""race"" for any kind of phenotype that can be produced by in-breeding within animals of that phenotype. So if you need a white-brown spotted cat and a black cat to produce a white-black spotted cat white-black spotted is not a race, but e.g. white-brown spotted can very well be one if the offspring of two white-brown spotted cats happens to be regularly white-brown spotted.

What it doesn't say, of course, is anything about any other trait than that which can be kept up. There might be bastards and angels among our white-brown spotted cats, and to get pure bastards or pure angels you might need to live with a vast collection of fur colours, if you can breed for a certain set of character traits in a given species, at all.

Then, and now comes the thing *every* racist gets wrong: Genetic predisposition is a very low-key influence in human behaviour and capabilities, culture is way more important. Not having to wait for genetics to select/create fit behavioural traits is our main genetic advantage over other animals.

We are, so to speak, the [border collies](http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/border-collie.htm) of primates: Highly intelligent, but if not properly trained, possibly bastards of epic proportions. But racists probably don't know anything about shaping their own character, or they wouldn't be racists in the first place. Hen and egg. Border collies are quite the exception when it comes to a for-character breed being quite uniform in appearance, btw.

&gt;The Commissioner heads up the Directorate-General for Trade in defining the commercial policy of the EU, which has been exclusively under the EU's mandate since the EEC's Rome Treaty in 1957. Due to the size of the European economy, being the world's largest market and having a huge slice of world trade, this position can be very important in dealing with other world economic powers such as China or the United States. Former Commissioner Leon Brittan commented that “Frankly, it is more important than most [national] cabinet jobs”.[4]

&gt;The Commissioner defines the trade interests of the EU and negotiates bilateral, regional or multilateral agreements with third countries. He monitors the implementation of such agreements and deals with any unfair practices, devises and monitors internal and external policies concerning international trade, ensures consistency in EU external policies and provides up-to-date public and industrial economic information

&gt;If you decide for a negative vote before the European Court rules, let me tell you that the Commission will nonetheless continue to pursue the current procedure before the Court, as we are entitled to do. A negative vote will not stop the proceedings before the Court of Justice.

It would have been a bit more genuine if it was going to be sent to European Courts to check for constitutionality regardless of the vote; but he implies otherwise. Should they vote yes on ACTA, i'm sure the question of the court will be quietly forgotten. What he is saying here is, we only give a fuck about the constitutionality if you exercise your democracy. Toe the line and we can chill about the constitutionality question. His contempt for European democracy is scandalous. 

If anything, it does show the panic of the pro-ACTA side. The EU commissioner should not be talking like this. The fact that he is reduced to threats like this shows that they have given up on trying to win the argument on reasoning. 

There can be little doubt that their panicked masters are throwing everything they can behind closed doors. And it will be a disaster if the EU Parliament votes yes on ACTA because only the pro ACTA side was active in the lobbying. The people have to be the counter voice. We are in the final minute; and we need to see this finished. 

[**ACTA – If You Think We've Won, We've Lost**](http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.8/acta-winning-or-losing)

&gt;There are two possible outcomes.

&gt;The first is the anti-ACTA campaign will be anesthetised by complacency – assuming victory, citizens will stop contacting Parliamentarians, will not take part in demonstrations and will reassure MEPs that our attention span is so short that we can be ignored on ACTA... And we reassure our opponents that no future democratic movement will be able to sustain a campaign as long as needed. We lose. Europe loses.

&gt;Or we do our duty for European democracy and maintain our pressure right up until the vote. And then we win. And Europe wins.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I'd say that putting all media outlets under the supervision of a state controlled body, firing half of all their employees and reshuffling the rest, making sure to put sympathizers of the ruling party in their places sounds pretty authoritarian. Not to mention how the first thing they did was fire everybody working in administration not sympathizing with the party and replace them with party sympathizers.

Yes but you should understand how it actually works: basically the elites trained and experiencd in the commie system are all forming a left-liberal ""old boys network"" - you could even say mafia, and they are occupying all these positions, through contacts and nepotism. So the only way to put in some real competition is through political muscle.

So it is not like in some normal country where competition is overridden by political muscle, it is more like some inbred network/mafia prevents competition, and the only way you compete is through politics.

&gt;Then all the whole rewriting of the constitution

Because sooner or later it is a good idea to get rid of a constitution modeled after Stalin's one

&gt;a bunch of nationalistic hogwash referencing God (pretty much took away secularism there)

In the fucking preamble. Making some light references. Not actually rules like everybody must be nationalist and religious. Just recognizing the country's heritage, in a similar fashion as the Polish constution. Many countries in Europe are monarchias and pretty much the whole of Scandinavia + the UK has either a state or a national church. The Hungarian constitutions has neither of these, merely a mention of monarchical and Christian heritage in the preamble. If it is too much for you you are applying a double standard - or way, way too extremely liberal/progressivist.

&gt;Then the whole pointless handing out of citizenship to Hungarian outside the borders, who will thus receive all the privileges of citizenship without having to pay any tax for it  who will thus receive all the privileges of citizenship without having to pay any tax for it, and considering that most of those who apply for it (Transylvanians)

Yeah, horribly authoritarian thing. I mean exactly what modern, postwar Germany done:

""Because they are considered Auslandsdeutsche (""Germans abroad"") by the German government, the Saxons have the right to German citizenship.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transylvanian_Saxons#World_War_II_and_afterwards

I think you are applying a double standard or think people are that ignorant not to know about such stuff.

&gt;and considering that most of those who apply for it (Transylvanians) are conservative

What else should they be when the left-liberal governments did not do shit for them, did not even symbolically recognize them properly. The worst was scaring people about ""23 million Romanians taking your jobs!"" It was disgustingly anti-patriotic, unfair and not based in reality.

&gt;Not to mention it served nothing else but pissing off Slovakia, even when they'd finally gotten rid of Fico. 

Good you mention Slovakia, their language law is way, way much more nationalist and authoritarian, so why isn't the Western media up in arms for this. Slovakia takes away citizenship from ethnic Hungarians who get Hungarian citizenship, how it is not much worse and much more anti-liberal? How about Slovakia turning facist priest Hlinka into an official hero in 2007 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Hlinka#Legacy which is like 300% more nationalist than anything the Hungarian government done, yet the Western media does not complain? Double standards everywhere.

Generally I think you are apply a very double standard. Or you do not know about these other stuff - because their elites are less snitchy and don't tell you this all.


&gt;If someone is beaten at school, it ought to be reported to the staff so that the bullies can be appropriately reprimanded. Hell, it is the very duty of any school to take a stand against and combat bullying and violence on its premises, just like in any other civilized society.

No, this is one-sided. There is a case for this, but there is also a case for being a man with balls and settling one's problems privately, and not asking others to fight our battles. And there is the extreme case of gaining the upper hand with over-exaggerated snitching, which is a spineless strategy in any fight. This is a case of this.

Such a framework elevates responsibility for supervision to the European level, and provides for common mechanisms to resolve banks and guarantee customer deposits.

Cyprus has only been running a deficit since this last president (the one who is currently in power) got into power. Before that they were running a small surplus and paying off their debts.

At the end of the day, your assessment that that the tax payers will pay for the bailouts is correct. I personally am a tax payer in Cyprus as well. People made the wrong choices (such as the banks exposing themselves *too much* to Greece).. and now there are some issues which need a bailout (because of the way the country was locked out of international markets due to the ratings downgrades).

In the current worst case scenario projections regarding the natural gas projects that are being developed over the next few years, the government's cut of it will cover all of this exactly. In the best case scenarios, Cyprus becomes a Norway.

Long story short.. by **pure luck**, Cyprus will be ok. This crisis seems to have also opened their eyes that they cannot be directly linked to just one country (Greece in this case), and they will likely balance that aspect as well in time.

&gt;[T]he legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body.

Parliament has voted Commission to power; they can take that power. This is no way different than how most European member state cabinets work; the ruling parties of the parliament select the ministers, who themselves don't have to be elected, only to enjoy the the trust of the parliament.

Usually the leading party elects to nominate their leader as the prime minister and the minister posts are handed to MP's, but if better suited (or politically convenient) people are found outside, that's good as well. 

I don't really see how it would be more democratic if the leader of the biggest party at EP would just nominate himself as the president of the commission instead. Au contraire, then you mix party politics into something that should solely be about competence. Nobody would vote themselves OUT of power, but you just might vote out of power people who should be answerable to you but aren't.

&gt; It is purely a tautology to say that crises are caused by the scarcity of solvent consumers, or of a paying consumption. ... If any commodities are unsealable, it means that no solvent purchasers have been found for them... But if one were to attempt to clothe this tautology with a semblance of a profounder justification by saying that the working class receive too small a portion of their own product, and the evil would be remedied by giving them a larger share of it, or raising their wages, we should reply that crises are precisely always preceded by a period in which wages rise generally and the working class actually get a larger share of the annual product intended for consumption. From the point of view of the advocates of ""simple"" (!) common sense, such a period should rather remove a crisis.

- Make the Commission a real government, either with its President directly elected or elected through parliament
- Give the European Parliaments full and proper lower house legislative powers

true,Nederbird,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Yes but you should understand how it actually works: basically the elites trained and experiencd in the commie system are all forming a left-liberal ""old boys network"" - you could even say mafia, and they are occupying all these positions, through contacts and nepotism. So the only way to put in some real competition is through political muscle.

While that may perhaps be true from some outlets, I seriously doubt that either HírTV, EchoTV or Magyar Nemzet were in any way controlled by some ""left-liberal"" conspiracy. Also, even if that would be the case, what Fidesz is doing would not amount to anything more than replacing one corrupt system for another.

&gt;I think you are applying a double standard

No, I'm just against giving voting rights for people not living inside the countries borders. Sure, let them have their Hungarian citizenship if it matters so much to them, but don't let them decide the fate of a country they don't even live in. I know other countries do this, but that doesn't make me any supportive of it.

&gt;Good you mention Slovakia...

Yeah, I know Slovakia isn't that much better. However, my point was to take a less confrontational stance toward Slovakia when they'd finally gotten rid of Fico and his SNS allies. Then again, that government didn't prove very long-lived. About their language laws, I'm very much aware of those, and I'm glad that so far I don't know of any other EU country where such oppressive laws exist. Moreover, it was covered by Western media as well, as I remember reading about it in both English and German language papers when the matter was still fresh.

Concering Hlinka, that's deplorable. Though to me that seems very similar to how seemingly many people seem to like the fascist Horthy in Hungary. From what I can gather, the entire eastern half of Europe seems caught up in lauding fascists from the past.

&gt;If someone is beaten at school, it ought to be reported to the staff so that the bullies can be appropriately reprimanded. Hell, it is the very duty of any school to take a stand against and combat bullying and violence on its premises, just like in any other civilized society.

When a disagreement deteriorates to the point of a fistfight, then it's a problem that needs to be dealt with, no exceptions. It's not about asking others to fight our battle, but about doing away with violence by combating the backward macho mentality that gives rise to such things in the first place. Schools, as public places, need to prevent any sort of fighting, lest it only encourages bullies to carry on with what they do.",0,1340719206,null,0,false,0,c55rzyc,t3_vfs88,t1_c55rzyc,t1_c55pnft,null,1429233328,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,pantaloon,IREL,Munster,"&gt; This question has been decided long ago, though. The Maastricht Criteria were basically the decision. Some countries perform better than others here. The only reason why Greece can't be sovereign on this is because their crisis is everyone's crisis.

Well, the Maastricht criteria *were* the standards, until they were breached, without penalty, by France and Germany.    Then when punitive proceedings were started against Portugal and Greece, it was exposed for the sham it was.  Hence the need for the upgraded agreement.  I assume that Germany will obey this new agreement, since it's basically tailored for German economic needs during this point of the economic cycle.  Until it becomes inconvenient, when the time-bombs waiting for the German economy start to detonate.  Now, you can't have a multilateral agreement, with penalties, that only applies to the weaker members of the agreement, but that the strong ignore when inconvenient for them.

&gt; So who will lead? The weakened Frenchies or the economically strong Germans? Because in the absence of a real EU government there must be a leader, and this is traditionally France/Germany's role, seeing as they are the most powerful and basically the founders of the EU anyway.

Well, unfortunately, neither can.  France can't lead because it's too weak, and Germany can't lead because of the Nazis.  Sorry, but there it is.  Regardless of the nature of the current German state, and the righteousness of its politicians, because of Germany's very recent history, it will not be acceptable to a very large number of Europeans.   Give it a few centuries (see Napoleon) and try again.

Also, the increasingly apparent nationalism of German public opinion, and the autocratic tendencies/unpardonable lack of diplomacy of Merkel and Schauble in their utterances towards the naughty states, make it even less acceptable.  

&gt;  He's just given an interview calling for the transformation of the EU into a real democratic state

Now there's a paradox: the EU may be transformed into a democratic state, but not with the consent of its peoples.  Do you honestly think there's any way that the peoples of Europe would accept a radical transformation of the EU along German federal lines?  I can't see it.  Schauble might be somewhat socially autistic, but he's no fool, and he knows it too.

It is legally impossible for the Commissioner to ignore the will of the EU Parliament in terms of progressing with the ratification process, which is why the Commissioner expresses no such intention. It's actually a good thing that the Commission would press on with the court case regardless of the Parliament's vote, because then we will know whether (and why/why not) ACTA is compatible with EU law as the debate continues.

This:
&gt; If it is found to be incompatible, De Gucht admits that rather than accept this ruling, the European Commission will try to find some trick to circumvent it:

&gt; ""If the Court questions the conformity of the agreement with the Treaties we will assess at that stage how this can be addressed.""

Is the biggest load of BS I have read in a while. All the Commissioner says here is essentially that he'll cross that bridge when he comes to it. Nothing at all about circumventing the will of the court. The article completely puts words in the Comissioner's mouth.

Resubmitting proposals to be approved at a later date is standard practice. It in no way undermines the democractic process; all the standard procedures must still be observed, meaning that if the Parliament still isn't happy with the agreement, it still won't become law.

I haven't seen you shown any data either.

&gt;I never claimed they were. I claimed that such people existed once, and now they're virtually extinct

Blond people are not virtually extinct in Portugal. There are plenty of people with blond hair and blue eyes. About red haired people, even tough there are very few, i don't now if the term virtual extinct is the right one. Also immigration to Portugal is something relatively new to our country (during our history we were a country of emigrants, only recently have things turn around), we still have a very small immigrant community, but the one that we do have is composed by a lot of immigrants from eastern Europe (especially Ukraine) so using the same logic that you used about the Swedes being mixed with Turks and what not wouldn't we be getting blonder?


&gt;BTW, you first king was red-haired.

So what? He did not represent the average Portuguese at the time, his father was of the French nobility, that at that time were more Germans than French( you know since they were almost all of frank descend, being that the franks were a German tribe).

&gt;You forgot the Jews and the Alani. Oh, and you call that homogenous? I mean, you mix Iberic, Celtic, Germanic, Arabic, Berber, Semitic, Iranic blood... and you call that homogenous? ARE YOU UTTERLY INSANE???

I never said that we were absolutely homogeneous. i said that we were very homogeneous but that there were still some impact caused from the invasive forces or do you just read what you fell like reading?
and yes even with all those peoples, the impact that they caused or our genome was very small. I'm not saying that it didn't exist. I'm saying that it was a small impact. And also most of those invasive forces like i had already said, didn't brought with them populations large enough to cause such a big difference in our genome as you want to imply. Or what do you think that when the romans conquered Iberia they all packed they bags and came here? No they had some elites ruling here, that eventually with the further assimilations of Iberia in empire, even the ruling elites were replaced by natives. The same can be said about the moors. The jews, didn't really mixed that much with the natives, and lets not forget that most of them were eventually expelled from the peninsula.

&gt;Yes, and I actually read what they wrote. Maybe you should read, too.

I would be interested in that. Could you give me a source?

&gt;Magellan was serving the Spanish crown. You have no point again.

So what? I used him as an example to show you that at that time, the crew of a ship did in no way represent the people of the country that they were serving. the example stands.

&gt;I did not know that African slaves were promoted to ethnic Portuguese just because they were serving their Portuguese masters. Yet once again, you have no point.

I did not know that red hair sailors were promoted to ethnic Portuguese just because they were serving the Portuguese crown.
yet once again, you have no point.

Also i like the fact that you assume that just because they were Africans the must had been slaves, even tough there were plenty of free Africans serving in the Portuguese navy (and other European navies i might add).

People like the property developer I met, not to mention the construction workers and many other interests, would have been ferociously angry if the authorities had tried to curb lending. It takes a very tough set of regulators do so. Often, too, the latter cannot imagine how badly things will turn out. Second, the lending might then have come directly from foreigners rather than via Spanish institutions. Would the Spanish authorities have been able to prevent such inflows under European Union rules? I believe not.

&gt;Alternatively, they could have tried to make their banks more robust. But they did in fact try to do so, with their famous policy of dynamic provisioning. It was controversial at the time, though a good idea. The problem, as we can now see, is that it was nothing like enough. Banks needed far more capital than they had to survive a crisis of this magnitude.


In Finland, there's been talk of limiting the amount of borrowed funds one could use in buying real-estate. It has however met some resistance. eg. harder for young people to buy a flat. We'll see how that goes. And let's not forget Finland's housing mess from 20 years ago. ",0,1340726979,null,0,false,0,c55tx6p,t3_vmr89,t1_c55tx6p,t1_c55tjem,null,1429234306,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Funny you say that. I also happen to have a copy of an english dictionary by my side, also from Oxford University Press. It is of course, not up to date (it was bought some years ago) but the first entry of mongrel is exactly the same as yours, however there is an interesting second entry, that states the following :

*2. (derog sl) a person of mixed descent*

What do *derog* and *sl* keywords mean? A mistery, I say.
