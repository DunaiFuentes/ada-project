No politician that wants to hold office would ever advocate for this, because the people simply don't want that.

Further the 'practical' issue of:

&gt;arrest every one who has a gun. 

Is laughable; it's already impossible to simply ""arrest"" criminals that illegally own weapons or use weapons illegally until they make themselves known through crime.

&gt;Or you can make it more gradually by first outlawing heavier guns, and then smaller ones.

And this is why legislation is opposed at every step of the way.

You're not going to take guns from the American public.

The currency would also rise in value making it much harder for it to export. For a country that imports do the opposite dump gold on the market and make the price fall. 

A currency is still fiat even if it's backed by some kind of material. Instead of a printing press you have a gold mine. You can still get all the same problems with inflation that you get with printed money. If you don't believe me see the economy of Spain after its conquered the new world. It brought back tons of gold which caused the price of gold to drop and the Spanish doubloon to become worthless.

They followed a legal procedure, and at least some some of their accusations towards Basescu were approved by the Constitutional Court - most importantly that Basescu has made certain decisions on behalf of the Prime Minister.

However, if you ask me, there was an earlier instance when Basescu broke the Constitution. It was not used in the impeachment motivation by the USL, because since then Basescu was re-elected (as you said, the law isn't the priority of the Romanian citizens), but the effects are still here today - the structure of our Parliament does not reflect the people's vote.

According to the Constitution, the President is supposed to appoint a candidate for Prime Minister after consulting the party holding the absolute majority in Parliament. (The PM candidate then forms the Government, and the Government is voted in by the Parliament). 

In 2009 the previous Government had fallen by a vote of no confidence. An alliance was formed by the PNL, PSD and UDMR - so all Parliament parties except for the President's, PDL. The alliance asked the President to appoint their PM candidate. The President refused, claiming that the Constitution says *party*, not *alliance* holding the absolute majority. First he refused to name a PM candidate at all, then he named a technocrat who formed a Government with members of the PDL, then he named the previous PM who had just fallen by vote of no confidence. After dragging the situation for some time (1-3 months, I don't remember exactly), he managed to convince some members of Parliament from the PSD and PNL that they can't win like this way and they have to switch parties to PDL. Thus PDL came to have a (relative) majority in the Parliament, and governed happily until 2012. With a Parliament seat distribution that did not reflect the result of the elections, but the result of Basescu's power negotiations.

Yes, if they keep paying back the debt. If not, salaries can be payed just fine. That's key to this. Now Greece will further default against the EU taxpayer. Which is so wrong and stupid in so many ways. 


&gt;  had generous pensions, generous everything while not bothering to reform anything

Well all this was horrible before the crisis as well (but for a segment of the population). 

There are two reforms going on in Greece right now. Banks are bailed out continuously (to the tune of billions) and salaries and pensions are slashed. Nothing else. This will mathematically lead to a further default, this time ECB (read- the EU taxpayer) will pay the burden. 

ECB/EU is not helping Greece, not the rest of EU. They are helping banks. 


&gt; Certainly not the taxpayers of Europe. Most of the debt that the banks previously held in Greek bonds, are not instead held by the taxpayers of the EZ. 


True. But that was the overall goal as I said previously. Think about it. Why is ECB buying bonds from Cayman island funds ?

It's the phrase 'a rising tide raises all boats' 
  
now consider if CERN invented a matter transportation device, it would completely change the world for every single person living on it - we could have moon bases and asteroid mining within mere years; the improvement that would make in production potential, quality of life and similar metrics would be astronomical.  It might seem unlikely by the WWW, Computers, The Steam Engine, even the accurate sea clock were monumentus enough to totally change the world.  
  
The EU is in a perfect position to embrace open and collaborative projects intended to produce methods of improving the life style of the majority of the planet, certainly of europe - serious projects to establish community producible solutions to local problems should be a core concern of modern governments, in my location for example were the British Government to fund a study into and design of effective rainwater capture, storage and use system which is shared with an open licence so as to allow small local firms to manufacture and fit systems then they could significantly help the local trades while lessening the pressure on the already stressed water networks - such a system if well designed and documented could them be used in Germany, Spain or anywhere else in the world.  
  
Effectively this would lessen the cost of water across the board, the complexity of the infrastructure and etc. relating to cost saving; businesses and homes with lesser out goings are more stable and more able to spend money on improvements in life style rather than simply keeping up will bills...  If we want a stable economy then this is an important step towards that, governments of big nations with HUGE r&amp;d budgets should be working on facilitating cost saving and self-sufficiency issues.  One R&amp;D project could act as a small-industry stimulus bill, an infrastructure improvement project, AND it could slash the cost of running every single public service from schools and hospitals to nursing homes and sports halls - they all use water and could all benefit from a reduction in their costs.

Really? But then you'd have no one to blame but yourselves. Now you can use Southern Europe as a convenient scapgoat for the whole mess. I don't understand why you say that would be easier. Historically, crises like this always end up with rising nationalism and xenophobia, exactly because politicians decide to distract the population by saying it's the fault of the foreigners. 

&gt; A weak Euro would have helped us transform from an exporter to the EU to an exporter to the world, thus easing us going back to a national currency. Seems like a win-win scenario to me.

This is what is happening now and to a lesser degree what has been happening since the introduction of the euro. However, if Germany was completely unwilling to defend the common currency at the onset of the crisis, you'd be back to your beloved Deutsche Mark and your exports would be much less competitive.

&gt; OK, so tell me: What exactly is it that we asked from the Greeks that turns out to be impossible?

IMF programmes usually fail because they ask the people to accept a much lower standard of living than before and because the cuts are often too brutal and cause the economy to fall into indefinite recession. Now, IMF programmes usually combine internal devaluation with currency devaluation. Inside the eurozone, the second part cannot be done, therefore the programme is even less likely to work.

To put it in simpler terms: Recession has been greater than what the programme said it would be, as a consequence the tax base is shrinking faster than anticipated. Which means the govermnent collects less revenue that was forecasted. Then the creditors say that the programme is off track and more cuts are needed. This same story has been going for the last three years. 

&gt; The retirement age is when you have the chance to get retirement benefits. Which is a solid ten years earlier in Greece than in Germany. 

Not sure how it works in Germany, but in Greece retirement benefits depend on how much you paid into the system. If you couldn't find work for large parts of your life or the work you found did not pay into a retirement fund, then when you reach the retirement age your pension is going to be very very small.

&gt; While there exists no specific EU law providing for the orderly withdrawal from the EMU and euro, EU law does provide, by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, for the *withdrawal of a member state from the EU itself*. This provision, added by the Lisbon Treaty, which was adopted in December 2009, provides the right of EU member states to notify the EU Council of their desire to withdraw from the union without any preconditions. The withdrawal shall be effective two years from the date of notification or from the date of agreement with the council concerning continuing relations between the exiting member state and remaining union. 

A withdrawal would cause a bank run. Münchau explains the rationale behind the current framework.

http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/5d7ff324-a0e6-11e1-9fbd-00144feabdc0.html

&gt; What makes bank runs so lethal in the eurozone is the legal framework. The most important rights conferred by the EU to its citizens are the four fundamental freedoms – of movement of labour, goods, services, and capital. Article 66 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union says the freedom of capital movement can be suspended but only in relation to third countries. The article can be invoked to stop Greek outflows to Switzerland, but not to Germany, at least not legally. *That is one of the reasons why a eurozone exit cannot be legally accomplished inside the EU.*

Si des comportements posent problèmes, les lois visant à les réprimer ne doivent pas être conçues avec une communauté spécifique en tête. Si on doit protéger les femmes des injures et du sexisme (et on le doit !), alors on doit aborder le problème comme si *tous les français* sans exception sont susceptibles d'avoir ces comportements problématiques, et punir ces comportements indépendamment de l'origine des fauteurs de trouble.

The actual number of Fortune 500 companies per area are included below.

According to the CNN numbers [here](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2012/countries/US.html), and wikipedia population figures, the number of fortune 500 companies per million people is:

Area | F500 per million | F500 Companies | Population
:---|:---|:---|:---
US | ~0.420 | 132 | 313.992m
Europe | ~0.215\* | 159 | 739.165m\*

Secondly this is a bad measure of economic success anyway. It could well be true that the Eurozone spawns many smaller good companies, rather than fewer large ones.

&gt;Simply put, if we build the Raspberry Pi in Britain, we have to pay a lot more tax. If a British company imports components, it has to pay tax on those (and most components are not made in the UK). If, however, a completed device is made abroad and imported into the UK – with all of those components soldered onto it – it does not attract any import duty at all. This means that it’s really, really tax inefficient for an electronics company to do its manufacturing in Britain, and it’s one of the reasons that so much of our manufacturing goes overseas.

I believe more can certainly be done, on a national level, to aid these companies. Even something as simple as a tax break for this sector would help startups get onto their feet.

On a European level, something like the [SME funding programme](http://ec.europa.eu/small-business/funding-partners-public/finance/index_en.htm) specifically tailored for IT businesses might work.

Most of the non-touristy stuff will be oltrarno, i.e., on the opposite side of the Arno as the Duomo. That's where the residents live, but there's a lot of non-touristy stuff on the Duomo side as well! Be warned - they may speak very little english at some of the places on this side (depending on how small they are). 

As far as nightlife, Central Park is a great place to check out. It's fun, a bit touristy to be honest, but it's an outdoor park and a really great time (as it gets colder, you'll want to stay away a bit haha). We were all big fans of Salamanca, which is a tapas bar that turns into a Salsa dance club on Tuesdays, so if you enjoy that kind of thing you should check it out. Beyond that there's 21, Shots Bar, Space and YAB (I would avoid the last two, but you know, check em out, see what you think)

Few cool historic things to see:

* Michelangelo’s David

* Medici House
* Il Duomo (Big Church)
* Gli Uffizi
* Santa Croce (Other big church haha)
* Ponte Vecchio (you'll see this loads)
* Piazza Michelangelo
* Fiesole (Mountain town a little north of Florence - great views!)

As far as food goes, Florence is an amazing place for food - best gelato I had in Italy actually. Check out:

* I Due Fratellini - Small sandwich shop near Duomo (AMAZING + Simple)
* L'Oile Shoppe - Other sandwich store
* Il Cantinone - Great hole in the wall tuscan place on Oltr'arno (They speak NO english here, but you can get along with a tad bit of Italian)
* La Carraia - AMAZING Gelato, about two bridges east of the Ponte Vecchio, on the Oltr'arno side
* Il Teatro &amp; Quattro Leoni - Great Florentine Food - Il teatro has an amazing Bistecca Fiorentina, the typical Florentine Dish

Florence is great for day trips around Tuscany - it's really close to:

* Pisa (Obvious why you should go there haha)
* San Gimignano (AMAZING GELATO)
* Montepulciano (Great wine)
and a bunch of other cool places

Beyond all this, the best way to live as a local, is to truly pretend you're a local. Buy fruit from local vendors and make friends - they'll tell you some of the best places to go. Buy meat at the local butcher's for great sandwiches! Above all, have a great attitude, and just be willing to make friends everywhere - everyone's super nice!

&gt; Turkey argues that Cyprus should not be allowed to enjoy the benefits of its natural resources without the Turkish Cypriots also sharing in that revenue. **It also claims that part of Cyprus’ EEZ violates Turkey’s own continental shelf**. *Being one of the few countries not to sign the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, Turkey refuses to acknowledge islands’ right to an EEZ*. 


This also shows that they care a lot about the turkish cypriots.

&gt; The agreement signed with the Turkish Cypriots gives Turkey the lion’s share of rights in the waters between Turkey and Cyprus’ northern coast.  


Further proof that Turkey are being weird with their neighbours in general:

true,TuEsiAs,null,null,"**A Brief History of why Public demonstration of Soviet symbols is banned in Lithuania.**


In August 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, with secret clauses assigning spheres of influence in the area of the Baltic Sea.


The Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to Lithuania before midnight of June 14, 1940. The Soviets, using a formal pretext, demanded to allow an unspecified number of Soviet soldiers to enter the Lithuanian territory and to form a new pro-Soviet government (later known as the ""People's Government""). The ultimatum and subsequent incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union stemmed from the division of Eastern Europe into the German and Russian spheres of influence in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939.


On July 1, the People's Government dissolved the Fourth Seimas of Lithuania and announced a show election to the People's Parliament to be held on July 14. A new election law was adopted on July 5. The law, in violation of the constitution, specified that only communist organizations could propose candidates and that not more than one candidate could stand for each seat available in the parliament. The official results showed a voter turnout of 95.51% and support of 99.19% to the communist delegates.


Immediately after the occupation, the new government began implementing political, economic, and social Sovietization policies. On July 1, all cultural and religious organizations were closed. The Communist Party of Lithuania—with some 1,500 members, —and its youth branch were designated the only legitimate political entities. Before the elections to the People's Seimas, the Soviets arrested about 2,000 of the most prominent political activists. These arrests paralyzed the opposition. The repressions continued and intensified. An estimated 12,000 individuals were imprisoned as ""enemies of the people"" during the year following the annexation. Between June 14 and June 18, 1941, less than a week before the Nazi invasion, some 17,000 Lithuanians were deported to Siberia, where many perished due to inhumane living conditions.


All banks (including all accounts holding over 1,000 litas), real estate holdings larger than 170 m2 (1,800 sq ft), and private enterprises employing over 20 workers or grossing more than 150,000 litas were nationalized. This disruption in management and operations created a sharp drop in production. The Lithuanian litas was artificially depreciated by three to four times less than its actual value and withdrawn by March 1941. The drop in production, combined with massive spending of appreciated rubles by Russian soldiers and officials, caused widespread shortages. All land was nationalized; the largest farms were reduced to 30 ha (0.30 km2), and extra land (some 575,000 ha (5,750 km2)) was distributed to small farmers.  In preparation for eventual collectivization, farm taxes were increased by 50–200% and additional heavy in-kind conscriptions were enacted. Some farmers were unable to pay the exorbitant new taxes, and about 1,100 of the larger ones were put on trial.


Between 1941 and 1944, the German invasion of the Soviet Union caused its de facto dissolution. However, with the retreat of the Germans in 1944–1945, Soviet hegemony was re-established.


After the Lithuanian SSR was re-established in 1944, an estimated 120,000 to 300,000 Lithuanians were either killed or deported to Siberia and other remote parts of the Soviet Union.


Resistance units varied in size and composition, ranging from individually operating guerrillas, armed primarily for self-defence, to large and well-organized groups able to engage significant Soviet forces in battle. It is estimated that a total of 30,000 partisans and their supporters were killed during the guerrilla warfare from 1944 to 1953.


Inefficiency of systems without competition or market-clearing prices became costly and unsustainable, especially with the increasing complexity of world economics. Such systems, which required party-state planning at all levels, ended up collapsing under the weight of accumulated economic inefficiencies, with various attempts at reform merely contributing to the acceleration of crisis-generating tendencies.


In 1989 a group of writers and intellectuals sets up Lithuanian Movement for Reconstruction (Sajudis). Its leaders declare at a mass rally in the capital, Vilnius, that the USSR occupied Lithuania illegally.


In early 1990, Sąjūdis-backed candidates won the elections to the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet. On March 11, 1990, the Supreme Soviet proclaimed the re-establishment of Lithuanian independence. On March 15, the Soviet Union demanded revocation of the independence and began employing political and economic sanctions against Lithuania. Soviet military was used to seize a few public buildings, but violence was largely contained until January 1991. During the January Events, the Soviet authorities attempted to overthrow the elected government by sponsoring the so-called National Salvation Committee. The Soviets forcibly took over the Vilnius TV Tower, killing 14 unarmed civilians and injuring 700. Moscow failed to act further to crush the Lithuanian independence movement and the Lithuanian government continued to work.


The newly declared Republic of Lithuania began establishing the State Border Guard Service, which also became a symbol of its strive for independence. The Soviet government viewed the customs posts as illegal and sent the OMON (Special Purpose Police Unit) troops against the posts, especially those along the eastern border with Belarus. The unarmed, custom officers and policemen were harassed, beaten or killed, their cars were stolen or bombed, the posts were burned down or wrecked, and work of the checkpoints was otherwise disrupted. Two of the incidents resulted in the deaths of eight Lithuanian citizens. In total, about 60 officers were attacked and injured, and 23 border posts were burned or destroyed.


During the national referendum on February 9, 1991, more than 90% of those who took part in the voting (76% of all eligible voters) voted in favor of an independent, democratic Lithuania. 

During the August Coup in Moscow, Soviet military troops took over several communications and other government facilities in Vilnius and other cities, but returned to their barracks when the coup failed. The Lithuanian government banned the Communist Party.

Did we get richer in the West by indebting ourselves? No, though debt did help. Western market economies allocate (and allocated) the majority of their resources using the market, that is on supply and demand. This meant that areas where there would be a god return on investment saw higher levels of investment think the railways in the 1800's or car manufacturing after the war. This led to a greater accumulation of capital that allowed for more investment, increasing both wealth and income.

Non-market economies allocated their resources though other means, in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Bloc for example resources allocation was largely through the state, which did not take into account the principles of supply and demand. This led to a substantial increase in the production of some goods - such as steel or weapons, and a stagnation or decline in the production of some goods such as consumer goods. As they did not allocate their resources as efficiently the level of growth in capital and in income was lower in non market economies. Over time this meant the levels of income that were once similar (such as East and West Germany) slowly drifted apart as the more efficiently investing West saw its wealth grow faster.",0,1343836237,null,0,false,0,c5mljfc,t3_xi52c,t1_c5mljfc,t3_xi52c,null,1429525208,18,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,18

Again, *says you*. This is the whole point. Once you start allowing any person or group of people to prohibit freedom of speech, you no longer have it.

&gt;Let us assume that free speech is one universal right that should never be abolished.

That is a very big assumption, but I will say that I support freedom of speech a fundamental human right.

&gt;But, letting someone to talk about annulation of freedom of speech -letting ""propaganda"" exist - is potentially like prohibiting free speech itself.

NO! Prohibiting free speech is the only thing that is like prohibiting freedom of speech. Talking about it is **not** the same thing, and should never be treated as such. One involves force, the other does not.

&gt;So, free speech might lead its to self-destruction.

If you want to have rights, you have to accept that things can go wrong.

&gt;So why would anyone be allowed to put at risk the one universal right?

They're allowed to *talk* about doing anything, because talking and expressing has doesn't actually do anything, it's transfer of thought or ideas, nothing more. If you want to start saying certain ideas are fundamentally dangerous then well done, you're into Thought-Crime land.

Camping can be great if you're with friends. Generally, it's not my cup of tea, though. I hope you can get some sleep. Last time I was camping at Nature One (2005), people were blasting music the entire time.

true,ajuc,POLA,Poland,"Many post-soviet countries defaulted on their debt when they turned capitalist (at least partly). For example Poland was forgiven some of its debts in early '90.

For these countries credit (no pun intended ;)) - they were smart enough not to get much new debt after 1989, that's why they are more solvent now in general.

Communist countries were very, very, very inefficient. So inefficient, that 1 year after the shock therapy of 1989 in Poland, amid 20% unemployement, after a few years of hyperinflation, with state factories bankrupting all over the place, people having hard time to live in  a new reality, shops were full of goods, Poland produced enough food to export it. Before 1989 most goods had to be regulated because of shortages, and everybody had a job. 100% of Poles during communism produced MUCH less, than 80% of Poles during initial phases of capitalism, when everything was changinng all the time, and nobody knew what to do :)

The inefficiences came from a few factors. I think the main factor was that having a job was state mandated - everybody got a job, no matter if he's any good, if he do sth at all. People drinked beer at building site for 6 hours, and hit a few times with hammer when manager came, and they went to home after that. No incentives for work == everybody pretended they work, nobody did anything if it was possible to avoid it. Also even if you got raise, you had the same living standard, because to buy anything important you had to have not only money, but also talons. So why bother with working hard, if it gives you nothing?

Other than that - state made stupid decisions all the time. For example huge industrial complex (Nowa Huta) was placed near the most pretty and historic Polish city (Kraków), without any economical reasons, just to put there more factory workers to balance all these intelectual workers that were state oponents. Gierek indebted Poland and wasted most of the money on stupid investitions that generated jobs and growth for a few years, but after that only generated costs and spiraling debt. Like buying licences for outdated foreign products that were then mass produced in Poland. Poles bought them, because there was no alternative, but export was a big no-no.

Incentives were set by state in stupid way. For example Poland has big coal reserves, but almost no oil reserves. So communist made incentives in such a way, that transport by (coal or electricaly powered) trains was prefered over transport by cars that run on oil. There were documented cases where something was transported 20 km to railroad reloaded to train, transported 5 km on this railroad, reloaded to truck, then transported 20 km from this railroad to the destination, when 15 km transport by truck would suffice, just because if sth was transported on rails, factory got some goodies (like talons for cars for managers, or sth).

Things produced by industry were bad quality, and outdated, because whatever got eventually produced, would be sold out anyway, because there were shortages of everything. People bought shoes no matter the shape and of wrong size, whenever they had a chance, just to be able to exchange them with neighborns for sth other, because it was rare to be able to buy shoes of any size at all, so you bought whatever you could. 

The most wanted good was toilet paper (I kid you not - it was very hard to get toilet paper, there was never enough of it). Cars were sold on talons. You signed in for a car, waited for sth like 5 years, then if you had luck you could buy that car (the price was very cheap). If you wanted, you could sold your car after a few years of driving it, for a few times more, than the original price, because people wanted to buy a car without waiting. Of course the cars produced sucked, but it was better than nothing.

true,SimonGray,DENK,Nørrebro,"Since no one seems to be answering the question...

Do you know what bonds are? The government debt of a country is mostly a reflection of how many people have invested their savings in bonds (as opposed to real estate or stocks). It's not helpful to look solely at government debt figures. What you need to _also_ look at are the actual **interest rates** on the bonds issued, not the amount of debt created by bonds.

_The explanation:_

Currently, Denmark is issuing lots of bonds with effectively negative interest rates. So we're racking up a bunch of dangerous debt!!! Well, no, actually not... since we'll eventually pay less back (inflation-adjusted) than we're taking in on these bonds. But of course, **any issuing of bonds will inflate the government debt figure**. In reality, government debt is mainly just a medium-term cash storage mechanism for banks.

* If you have a _high_ government debt with _low_ interest rates on the issued bonds it's a reflection of how safe banks and other bond buyers feel about depositing their money (like Germany or Japan, for example)

* If you have a _high_ government debt with _high_ interest rates on the issued bonds, then it probably means you're having a hard time balancing your budget with the ordinary means (i.e. taxes) and that you're trying desperately to get money from foreign investors instead (like what's happening in Greece, Portugal, etc.)

Furthermore, the figure only reflects total debt, not net debt. This means that _country A_ and _country B_ could theoretically cross-owe each other 100% of their GDP, but the net figure would of course be 0%.

If we do not consider the last decade when things got out of hand the incurrence of debt was very profitable. The debt we got enabled the construction of a decent infrastrucutre, good education and a whole range of other investments in our countries. 

I know of two countries that prove that being (virtually) debt free does not mean you're rich in fact it impoverishes you beyond reckoning. Romania and Portugal. In Romania Chaushesku had the idea of becoming debt free resulting in massive poverty since all available money was diverted to paying of creditors. 

Portugal was as poor as any third world country at the end of the dictatorship. IMO this was (among a whole range of other issues) because its government did not really invest in the economy nor its population nor its infrastructure instead it hoarded gold. Unfortunately the gold 'dissappeared', aka was stolen, with the carnation revolution. But the EU funds made up for it.

Risk-averse people obviously think it's a better business decision to invest in Danish bonds that give slightly _below inflation_ returns rather than Greek bonds that give high returns, but have very low credibility because the Greek government is in financial troubles - unlike the Danish one. People aren't forced to buy these bonds, they just think that it's better to store their money in Danish bonds compared to so many other options (0%-interest bank accounts or risky stock markets).

My point is that government debt is just a reflection of where people's savings are stored. You might as well call it a government savings account. It's only a bad thing if the government takes the money and spends it all - which is not happening in Denmark. That's why you can't post a graph like this and say ""look, our governments are all in debt!"". No, people are just depositing their money with the government for whatever reason they might have to do that.

The Umlaut is wrong... 

&gt; How would you feel if it were you?

I'm German. Wherever I go in the world, I get assaulted by SS-themed contempt. In short: cry me a river.

&gt; we'd do well not to over simplify the problems.

Sure. Still, can we also agree that especially Greece has acted in gross neglect and in a way that seems to mock the North, which has done a lot to make them survive until now?

&gt; Stop attacking the people and instead direct your energies at the ruling classes.

I am a believer in democratic principles.

They needed capital and high grade production equipment to develop, which they got from the West, who wouldn't exchange in anything but their own currency, which Eastern bloc countries often got from loans. When increasing trade deficits and debt levels met with a resource bust in the 80s, the IMF stepped in to force austerity policies on these countries. Poland had a number of structural adjustments, beginning as far back as 1970. This sort of ethos has stayed with Eastern bloc governments, who still work according to right wing economic policies (the party that emerged from the Hungarian Communist Party was actually seen as more Capitalist in the 90s and 2000s than their Conservative competitors). This was heavily detrimental to the people themselves, if you look at death rates for example they still haven't recovered to their 70s levels in most of Eastern Europe, but it kept debt levels low and corporations rich.

Most people in Florence will probably respond to you in English. But keep trying anyway. =) Get friendly with some locals, it's a great way to practice Italian as well as get a better feel for the town.

I found Florence to be quite expensive compared to the smaller towns in Italy, especially around the very touristy areas. I'd try to avoid eating in those areas if possible, but I'm sure there are exceptions. The best thing you can do is try to find good meals for good prices. If you're trying to dine cheaply, one person shouldn't have to eat for more than 30 euros, and that's on the high end; I'd say more between 10 and 25. A primo OR secondo piatto (first or second plate, basically pasta vs. meat) plus a contorno (a side dish) is plenty of food and won't be too expensive. Don't tip your waiter, you pay a cover charge (""coperto"") instead.

Go to a soccer game. Florence's Serie A team is Fiorentina, but expect to meet fans of a lot of different teams. It's definitely a huge part of Italian culture that's worth experiencing.

And of course, as others said, travel! One of the best weekends in Italy was when I traveled to four different small towns, and all of them were so unique from each other.

There are then shared competencies which member states can legislate in assuming the EU has not yet legislated in them. These include social policies, agriculture, trans european networks, transport, health and safety, etc. The EU coordinates foreign and military policy amongst member states as well.

There are a few others, but these are less important. Effectively, EU member states have 90% of the power. You can see that right now, with the eurocrisis. Had things been more centralised we would probably not be facing this as we could move funds around the EU (plus there would be eurobonds).

I would still consider the EU states as states, and not the EU as a state because the EU has less democratic legitimacy. When the EU becomes directly elected by the people, I think then we can begin to consider the EU more as a single entity. At the same time, you can still have a severely decentralised government (i.e. national governments taking the majority of the law making burden) while the federal or supranational aspect still having supremacy (Canada has a very decentralised government, I believe). 

The problem is, we are in a sort of state-limbo at the moment where no one is quite sure who has the most power.

true,Aevum1,7,Peñagrande,"It depends on how you´re getting to madrid. 

If you´re going to reach by train means you´re arrive at atocha or chanmartin, 

If you´re comming by airport, you´re going to burn around half an hour each way on the airport metro line getting to nuevos ministerios. 

now it depends on if you want the inner city tour or go it museums, going to the reina sofia or the pardo, to get a half decent look were talking about 2 hours and thats a superficial tour, so the museums might be a bad idea if you only have 4 hours in madrid,

it also depends on what four hours, 

But if its during business hours i´d probobly get to alonso martinez or tribunal, and walk down funcareal doing some incursions in to chueca to check the plaza and the san anton food market, and then down to barquillo which is somewhat meh but it ends in alcala wheres theres several ministries and the central bank, , go up alcala to gran via, go down up gran via up to plaza de españa, walk to tempo de bod and then go up behind gran via in the smaller streets up to callao and sol, from there check the plaza mayor, arenal street, the opera house and the san miguel market, 

walk down to palacio de oriente and see if i could walk a bit back down to la latina, but then again la latina might not be as nice by day since its a bar and restorant area, , in the whole area behind the mercado de san miguel theres old plazas and the old city center which is quite nice, from there i would go down atocha which is a pretty normal street with some things, there was a museo del jamon around there they had a special where you had a small ham sandwich for 1 euro, not sure if they still have that, whats interesting about atocha is that it was the old wholesale markets for fabrics. 

the thing is that atocha ends en paseo del prado leaving you infront of the retiro park (on the other side of paseo del prado), it leaves you a block the reina sofia, also leaves you near the 27 bus which is a normal inner city bus that runs the entire lenght of the paseo del prado and the castellana down to plaza castilla, so it passes next to the retiro, museo del prado, the national library, the old central post office, colon plaza, and should leave you again in nuevos ministerios which is 2 train stops from atocha, 1 from chanmartin and in direct line with the airport by metro. 

Metro is 1,50 for 5 stations and then an extra 10 cents per station up to 2 euros, when going from or to the airport it costs 5 euros as a airport extra. 

Train (cercanias) moves between 1,50 to 4 euros depending on where you´re going, 4 euros is C zone bumfuck kentucky distance, most inner city rides dont go over 2 euros

Bus is 1,50 for the blue buses which are inner city, the green ones are intercity and cost more, but you wont be needing them. 

For any other questions feel free to respond.

For example, the overall divide is roughly 55%-45% in favour of the Protestants, but of you look at the +65 population, the split is more similar to the old divide as seen at the conception of the state, or around 70-30 in favour of the protestants. However, of we look at -18's, we see a 55-45 divide, roughly, in favour of the Catholics. That means that as time goes on and the older people die, the population divide will change to favour the other community.

Then again, there's no guarantee that the Catholic or nationalist  families will even vote for a united Ireland if the had the majority, even the polls show that. But consider this, why have so many nationalists started to vote for the more extreme Sinn Féin as opposed to the more moderate SDLP? Additionally, once the majority has been gained, all it takes is one period in time where for whatever reason, be it economic, social or political, it will be more beneficial to be a part of the Republic of Ireland. All it takes is one referendum at the right time, in about 30 years or so, for it to happen.",0,1343865067,null,0,false,0,c5mtrav,t3_xii32,t1_c5mtrav,t1_c5mrp7e,null,1429529148,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

In quotes because independence is a scale, but sovereignty is binary: Either you have it, or you don't. And if you don't, you're not a state.

(That's a bit of a lie, of course, because there are in fact states that are not sovereign, but in the context of this discussion it holds true. Non-sovereign states are dependents of other states, which is not in any way the same as federation where sovereignty is shared but never transferred.)

The usage of ""Land"" and ""Staat"" in German is a little confusing in that it's sometimes backwards. Bavaria is certainly a state, and it has sovereignty over its territory, no matter how many treaties it has signed with other states, including those that compose the federation of Germany. The same with Texas and Coahuila (whose official title, ""Estado Libre y Soberano de Chihuahua"", makes that pretty clear).

I mean his economical plan is not even mathematically possible, and he fought a war against every group of people that wasn't the american male christian to lick up to the far right voters for support. He told the world old people in my nation ran away to other countries to avoid a lethal injection. I mean come on, he believed nothing of that himself.

He's a intelligent guy, and a good economist. Which means that he knows that most of the things he tries to do won't exactly work. He knows how hard these policies are going to hit certain states, where many of his supporters live.
And yet he smiles while trying to pass tax cuts for the rich, and tax increases for the poor, which will make the basics of living impossible for them (think healthcare). He even wants to cut on something called food stamps (i.e. food for poor families, yea very philanthropic).

He's a smart, but greedy, man. Working for greedier people.

Large companies that need many engineers (e.g. Siemens, Daimler, Airbus) could easily hire some of those 40.000 unemployed engineers in germany and even train them for the special needs. But, as greedy as big companies are, they won't. They want cheap labour. But as this argument is not really convincing they came up with a trick!
They simply made it a national problem and nationall solution.
It is true, that engineers are not only needed at Siemens or Airbus...but also for very very small companies in areas no foreigner would wanna go - to be more precise: just nothern bavaria alone has a dire need for engineers that can hardly be filled with some blue cards.

Now why is this a trick?

Well, the blue card is to attract foreigners and dump wages. As DW doubts there is hardly a reason to go to germany. People are not nice, weather is not nice....politics are just not nice.
Explain to a foreign engineer from India or Pakistan why asylum seekers from his country have to live way under any limit that would allow a humanworthy life.

The companies know that! Small companies in Oberfranken or Mecklenburg-Vorpommern know that! They know that even if a million blue cards would be thrown at India, the workers would preferrably go to Stuttgart or Hamburg instead of some small town with a huge number of conservatives...or lets be honest: fashists.
Foreigners are NOT welcome in Guben, Coburg or Loschwitz. 
Afroamerican friends of mine even get insulted in the center of Frankfurt.

The evil masterplan of Siemens, Airbus, SAP, Daimler etc. is to make the goverment estimate the number of needed engineers as high as possible...if the big ones would need a 100 egineers ...then the small ones sure do aswell. 
200 BlueCards...and let's say 25 pakistani engineers sign up for it...where will they go...mostlikely to the big ones. If just a 100 would have been issued the total number of foreign engineers would be significantly lower.

Most foreign engineers do not speak german. That is ok if you work for Airbus...but won't help shit if you work in Siegen or Augsburg.

That is why I think the entire bluecard thing is a trick pulled by the BDI.

Quote from [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Union) article:

&gt;When Philip II of Portugal (Philip III of Spain) died, he was succeeded by Philip III (and IV of Spain) who had a different approach on Portuguese issues. Taxes raised affected mainly the Portuguese merchants (Carmo Reis 1987). The Portuguese nobility began to lose its importance at the Spanish Cortes, and government posts in Portugal were occupied by Spaniards. Ultimately, **Philip III tried to make Portugal a royal province, and Portuguese nobles lost all of their power.**

&gt;Several other problems also damaged Portuguese support of their union with Spain. One of these was certainly the pressure from the center, especially from the Count-Duke of Olivares, towards uniformity and sharing the financial and military burden of Castile's wars in Europe. However, the Portuguese were hardly inclined to help with that, as Spain had failed to prevent the Dutch occupation of several of Portugal's colonial holdings, despite the fact that both the Portuguese and the Dutch were nominally under the same crown.",0,1343900952,null,0,false,0,c5n0xlc,t3_xii32,t1_c5n0xlc,t1_c5n0vx2,null,1429532595,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

From my limited POV: 

The large companies *are* swallowing up the majority of graduates, with not many questions asked. Did they pass, and do they wear pants for the inverview? Hired.^* 

 Regarding the 40K unemployed engineers (a number that is disputed, though that's not a big surprise): not all of them are skilled, and a large problem is likely the shit they are willing to put up with. It's not so much the pay as such, but the work required. Stuffing a few dozen guys into a container cube, locaton hoppiing, travel, overburdening projects, and understaffing infrastructure.

e se chiedi a chiunque parli e capisca bene l'inglese sotto i trenta ti rispondera' ""mah io serie tv, con e senza sottotitoli, videogiochi, sono stato tanto tempo in america"".

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"An economy is complex. Very, very complex. Just think about what goes into producing a car, all the parts and materials, as well as tools and machines that need spare parts and servicing themselves. A car manufacturing plant is dependent on many other plants that produce the things it depends on. If just one of those suppliers can't deliver one of the parts, maybe because they can't get a necessary spare part for one of the machines they need to make their product, because there is a shortage in raw materials or there simply was bad planning, there will be no cars.  

The same is true for pretty much anything. Even simple things. Just think about what goes into the production of a screw. You need the steel, obviously. You need machines, and they need to be kept operational, with energy to run them, oil to keep them running smoothly without too much wear, and spare parts to service them. Then you need packaging and have to organize distribution. If one of those isn't there or doesn't work, there will be no screws, or not enough of them. The car needs those screws. Those dependencies are what makes an economy so complex, and any less-than-optimal allocation of resources, be it raw material, parts, machines or labor, cascades through this network of dependencies and causes shortage one way or another.

The question now is how you organize a system of such enormous complexity like a national economy, and how you resolve shortages that will always exist in any such system regardless of how it's structured. The goal is to fulfill as much demand as possible at the lowest cost possible by allocating your resources in the best possible way.

One approach is a planned economy, where you try to predict demand for a certain product for a certain time period, typically five years, and allocate resources according to how you estimate demand for each good will be throughout the planning period. This works fine, unless of course your estimates are wrong or the production of essential parts falls short for one reason or another. Average waiting period for the Trabant 601, the model of the iconic East German car that was produced from the mid 60's until Reunification, was something like twelve or thirteen years. So, you ordered it when you got your driver's license and if you were lucky you took delivery when you turned thirty. Also, it had a two stroke engine and a cotton enforced phenol formaldehyde resin body. It's still loved dearly as an icon, but let's face it -- as a car, it was crap.

A market economy takes a different approach to solve the demand prediction and resource allocation problems, by essentially using a massively decentralized self-organizing system that tries to optimize itself towards a measure of efficiency that is expressed in monetary terms.  
This doesn't make the economy as a whole any less complex, and you still need to plan ahead and deal with unforeseen shortages. The overall complexity is even higher, because in a market economy, you typically have many more producers for the same product. The difference is that instead of just one planner that needs knowledge of the entire network of interdependent production facilities, you have many, many planners that only need knowledge about their own node in the network and its immediate neighbors. This system automatically adapts to shortages, because if demand exceeds supply, prices go up and, eventually, resources will get reallocated to take advantage of this opportunity.  
It's not optimal, either. Not all resources are easily replaceable, and the adjustment still takes time. Prices for hard drives were more than doubled for months after the flooding in Thailand, because you can't set up a plant in a week and even if you could it still wouldn't be a good allocation of resources because eventually the existing plants come back to production. Instead, what happened was that consumers delayed purchases because of the higher prices. The social cost was that couldn't ~~download as much porn~~ store as many vacation pictures as they wanted, which is not optimal. However, because prices could adapt, someone who really needed a new hard drive could still buy one from another manufacturer, albeit at a higher price. The shelve wasn't empty, because the consumer who was there first decided that at those prices, blu-ray was the better choice to store his home movie collection and a good substitute to still fulfill his demand. Producers of goods do the same thing, they adapt the production process of their product according to the cost of parts and their potential substitutes.  
They might be able to substitute one kind of plastic with another from a different supplier if their original one can't fulfill their demand, or maybe change their design to use less screws if those become too expensive. That's flexibility, the market adapts automatically without central planning.

Of course, a pure market economy has it's problems as well, which is why we need regulation, but that's another topic.",0,1343908824,null,0,false,0,c5n1oyz,t3_xi52c,t1_c5n1oyz,t3_xi52c,null,1429532954,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; he has never worked a real job in his life -  - he doesn't know the value of work

Nonsense. Most politicians are professional politicians nowadays, most of them never had any real career in any other domain. 

As a matter of fact, he graduated from the ENA, which is the kind of school where you do not succeed if you don't work hard. He was also exempted from military service (due to myopia) but overturned the decision and made it anyway. These are anecdotal evidence but they are not very compatible with someone that doesn't value work.

&gt; he doesn't know the value of expenditure - ie. he is poor at managing money

Fact : he improved the situation of the department of Corrèze, which was heavily in debt, thanks to his predecessor. Hardly compatible with someone that is ""poor at managing money"".

Why ?

&gt; I strongly suspect he thinks money grows on trees

I strongly suspect you are stupid. However, this doesn't prove anything.

&gt; And I think he is very happy to spend other peoples' money

Same comment.

&gt;  I very much fear he will be treating a few groups of people very harshly because he thinks he can get away with it - treating them that way in order to get taxation out of them.

You mean ""wealthy people"" ? Oh my God, that guy is trying to tax wealthy people, will someone call the police ? How dare he ? Now seriously, I understand why you don't like him. You own an apartment in Paris which is something the vast majority of population of France can't and will never afford. 

The problem France has right now is a deficit problem and a debt problem. Previous rightwing gouvernments where focused on cutting spending which is probably fine but is not the only way to solve a deficit problem. Increasing income works too, which means increasing taxes and that's what Hollande is doing right now.

Socialists in France have a reputation of being big spenders. However, the big picture is way simple : every single government in France has been a big spender. Sarkozy as been an incredible big spender during his time in office, increasing deficit and debt way beyond the effects of crisis alone and waybeyond what his predecessors did.

I'm not sold on François Hollande. I think he's an improvement over Sarkozy but I'm still skeptical on how he'll manage to get the deficit under control while avoiding to kill the economy with harsh austerity.

true,Reilly616,EURO,European Union,"Where you say Bavaria has sovereignty in certain areas, I would say it has ""certain exclusive competences"". This is how it is referred to in German law. (And it's also the term used in EU law). It really does seem to just be a case of us disagreeing on terminology. I use the words I use because I study law and these are the terms I have learned, and which would make sense to my peers without further explanation. 

I contend simply, that ""partial sovereignty"" though a meaningful thing (which I would call ""retaining exclusive competences"") does not amount to an entity being ""sovereign"". For an entity to be sovereign, it must retain the so called ""Kompetenz-Kompetenz"", that is, the competence to decide which level gets certain competences.

With this in mind, let's look at the examples. Bavaria does not have Kompetenz-Kompetenz. It cannot claw back a competence from the Federal level, because to do so requires an amendment to the German Constitution, which can only be amended by the Federal Parliament. This makes Germany sovereign, while Bavaria is not.

In relation to the EU, the same applies. To change who has what competence, a Treaty change is needed. But this time, it is ultimately up to the Member States. They hold the Kompetenz-Kompetenz, thus they are still sovereign entities.",0,1343916440,null,0,false,0,c5n2wik,t3_xj283,t1_c5n2wik,t1_c5n1b17,null,1429533525,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

* Cultures between various member states are quite different. Just look at [Hofstede dimensions](http://geert-hofstede.com/countries.html).
* While decision making would be more straight forward in the Federal level, there would be serious inside these newly found states. You just need to observe current differences between near by member states, for example Sweden isn't in Euro but Finland is, and the reasons to this can be found from culture, values, self-image, world view, etc..
* By creating new structures, you essentially dismantling structures that already work. Why brake something that already works?

Another thing is that why there should be 5-6 states with equal populations? Current EU works very well, because it has ever varying blocks of countries, for example Finland has supported hard line in case of loaning money to troubled countries, essentially being in the same block with Germany. However in case of how ECB should be used, the Finland opinion is probably nearer to Italy than it is to German one. The thing is that usually major countries will have different stands, and smaller countries gather around or pressure bigger countries to move here or there to gain their support, and then based on that bigger blocks will negotiate.

While per 9/11 the US was seen as pro-freedom and willing to sacrifice security for this, now it is not so clear in the whole war-on-terror mindset. Clearly there is a lot of post 9/11 paranoia, the whole TSA stuff, a too active, too tough police, now it seems more like pro-security and less interested in freedom.  On a more everyday level, American parents seem to be very paranoid about strangers being pedos. Or when a shy teenager does not dare to tell a girl he loves her  and follows her home unseen (perfectly normal, at least in my childhood in Hungary, I suppose in Germany too, loser, sure, but not scary), an American girl might see it as ""creepy"" read possible psycho/rapist.  This is much more relaxed in Germany / most of Northwestern Europe I think.

_Perhaps we can say that Americans prefer freedom when the danger is **things** (poverty, illness, etc. i.e. free market) but security when the danger is **people** (terrorists, pedos, rapists/psychos - strong police, TSA) and Germans/Northwest Europeans prefer freedom when the danger is **people** (relaxed security, easy police) and security when the danger is **things** (strong social welfare net)._

One more thing to add. _Of all European nations Germans imitate America the most._ For example look at the [Cobra 11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_11) series, the whole thing just smells like Hollywood, it fits nicely into the NCIS / CSI / JAG trend, plus lots of firefights, fast cars, the general feeling... in that series every random car mechanic seems to have a gun lol. Or at the World Cup when they arrived to South Africa in the biggest airplane of the world, that felt like a ""very American type thing"" (i.e. boastful, immodest). Germany created pretty much the only succesful large European fast food chain (Nordsee).  Or for example the whole car culture... Germany and America both have this kind of ""bigger and faster is better"" culture which is for example missing from Austria or Switzerland.

From the German page on Sovereignty: ""Bei der Gründung eines föderalen Gesamtstaates hingegen geben die nachmaligen Gliedstaaten – wie etwa in Deutschland und Österreich die Länder/Bundesländer, in der Schweiz die Kantone oder in den USA die Bundesstaaten (states) – ihre Souveränität teilweise an den Bund ab. Dies äußert sich insbesondere dadurch, dass im Bundesstaat der Bund die sogenannte Kompetenz-Kompetenz (oder auch Kompetenzhoheit) besitzt. Diese ermöglicht es ihm, die Kompetenzen zur Wahrnehmung neuer Staatsaufgaben aus seiner eigenen Machtfülle heraus an sich zu binden. Die Gliedstaaten können die Erfüllung von Staatsaufgaben nur in dem Maße selbst leisten, wie ihnen die dafür nötigen Kompetenzen vom Bund zugestanden werden.""

&gt; some small town with a huge number of conservatives...or lets be honest: fashists
&gt; The evil masterplan of Siemens, Airbus, SAP, Daimler etc

What? Are you serious? 

Sorry, but this sounds overly paranoid and prejudiced to me. First: why should the German government work against it's people? This statement is ridiculous. Do you really think that the government is controled by the big industrial companies in such a way that no politician, no big or small newspaper and no scientist will point out that this is only a way to lower the wages of engineers? 
Second: I'm not sure if you were ever in a small town, but we are not more racist or liberal than people from the big cities. And the equation conservative = fascist is wrong, not to mention that the CDU is in a scientific view not conservative at all. Conservatism can include many perceptions in the economic and the social/societal perspective, but racism isn't one of them. And the most companies, even in smaller towns have no more problems with english speaking employees. 
Third: I don't think that those companies have a ""masterplan"". Yeah, they have interests and are working on enforcing them, but they don't plan a big conspiracy. 

Concerning the real topic of this discussion: the BlueCard is a rather good idea, imo, since Germany lacked a good possibility for foreigners to apply to certain jobs, even if they wanted so. Now, they have at least the possibility. They DW article doesn't even critisize the idea of such a measure, it just mentions that there is still much work left to do until it operates as planned. There has to be avertising for Germany at foreign universities and IoTs and German companies have to improve their english.

1. Not all shows and movies are available in English
