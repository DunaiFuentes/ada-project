true,DogBotherer,BKFG,Anarchist,"&gt;I kinda disagree actually, although I know it's a minority and controversial viewpoint to take.

Well, you would, if you're sympathetic to ""anarcho""-capitalism (we call it [anarcho-Statism](http://struggle.ws/anarchism/writers/anarcho/anarchism/libcap/refuteAC.html)).  It's definitely a minority position - though quite popular online, with US users particularly - I've never met an active anarcho-capitalist in real life.

&gt;The idea that anarchism and socialism aren't diametrically opposite to me is utterly ridiculous.

That's because you confuse socialism with State control, whereas for me and other anarchists, left/libertarian Marxists etc. socialism is about economic democracy and worker control (i.e. [as Ernest Lesigne puts it](http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm) not ""The land to the State. The mine to the State. The tool to the State. The product to the State."", but ""The land to the cultivator. The mine to the miner. The tool to the laborer. The product to the producer.""  

To the vast majority of anarchists, it's free markets and capitalism which are oxymoronic, because capitalism has historically always been totally dependant on the State to allow capitalists to accumulate their wealth.  All so-called capitalist countries/economies have developed through massive State interventionism at home and abroad even during periods which have been grossly misrepresented and mythologised as ""laissez faire"".  Though I'm not a Chomskyist, a couple of Chomsky clips illustrate this nicely: [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxPUvQZ3rcQ) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTo7GkQ6iTs).

&gt;I suspect our politics are relatively similar, different in big ways sometimes, but not unrecognisably different.

There are undoubtedly areas of concord, and more than you'd think because of incompatible definitions (which I can provide chapter and verse on if you'd like), but I imagine our most insurmountable area of disagreement is likely to be regarding property - you probably are a strong advocate of private property rights, I consider them incompatible with liberty and support only usufructory rights.  But even here, the difference is less than you might imagine as Kevin Carson has done much to elaborate.

&gt;Take it there's no such thing as landlines then? I have this mental image of some faceless British dude sitting in a bamboo hut next to some paddy fields on reddit drinking a cup of builders tea. Very incongruous.

We have them (landlines), but the network is sketchy.  Like many developing world nations which have had rapidly growing economies in recent years, Vietnam has pretty much skipped them for cable and mobile telephone networks.

As for your image, it's not an uncommon one people have of my life here, but the reality is much more prosaic in many ways.  I have lived in the countryside, and it was good fun - I had a small farm for a while - but now I live in  city of 10 million (Saigon/HCMC), sipping green tea (but English Breakfast when I can get it) on my balcony, looking down at the local KFC!

Anyway, in a case like this, the height of the fall is known. The place of initial impact can usually be determined as well. From those two points, you can calculate the horizontal velocity, and that's where suicides and accidents differ. A suicide victim usually lands further away, either by jumping off a brink or from pushing her/himself away from a window. In an accident, victims have only very low horizontal velocity and usually try to hold on to something when they loose hold, so they land much closer to from where they fell.

listen - as I pointed out in my post above, it's a lost fight, and Transylvania will never go back to Hungary. It's not worth debating about - but with all due respect - What planet do you live on? To use the word 'Belong' is a loaded one - but learn your history - how much more ""belong"" can you get than being part of Hungary from Hungary's establishment in 1003 to 1919. I'd say that in anybody's book - over 900 years as part of a country can safely be called ""belong to"".  As for Hungarians and Romanians currently living together and coexisting in Transylvania, have you ever noticed how the 'most romanian' regions of transylvania are the hungarian border regions? That's due to a concerted effort to repatriate ethnic Romanians to those regions as a buffer after 1919. 

The fight is over and Hungary lost. We accept that (at least those of us who have a brain accept it), but that doesn't change the fact that yes, Transylvania ""belonged"" to Hungary.

That said, in theory a global optimum can only be reached in one step if it arises from a fully exhaustive (global) search of the allocation space. But we have a lot of steps, so incrementally getting closer to that sweet equilibrium seems to be a good solution too.

And even if you don't have central planning you need A LOT of data, to spot patterns that have real life malicious consequences (Ponzi schemes, monopolies, impending price crash in sectors that couldn't recover easily - eg. agriculture, or where the barrier to enter the market is so high, that the failing of a few market participants would just cause a sudden price shock and/or the remaining participants would have too much power).",0,1354780316,null,0,false,0,c7c32qk,t3_14c1ud,t1_c7c32qk,t1_c7brphd,null,1430594025,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8
true,bestia_interior,null,null,"I'm strongly opposed to it. In principle it seemed like a good idea in 2002, but the experiment has been a complete failure. The idea was to turn prostitution into a safe business and end exploitation of women in the underground, which has not happened.

We have a word for what happened. It's ""Verschlimmbessert"".

Pimps now have legal protection under the law, so it is not enough for a prostitute to come forward and simply say she was abused for the pimp to get in trouble. Now she has to prove beyond a reasonable that coercion or abuse did in fact take place, and that is nearly impossible in all but the most extreme cases. By the looks of it you can not differentiate a willing and a coerced sex worker, and that's where the whole problem lies. Knowing this organized crime has flourished in the sex trade and human trafficking has risen significantly since 2002. Most prostitutes now in Germany are immigrants from impoverished countries, to the tune of 98 percent, their economic troubles and incurred debt for being so ""generously"" brought to Germany by their sponsors serving as the grounds for exploitation and abuse. 

The woman that wants to become a prostitute out of her own free will is a unicorn. In a study based on interviewing 140 something of them not a single one supported the legalization of sex trade, and not a single one would have been doing what she was doing if she would have seen any other option. As a society, in Germany, I don't think supplying sex workers with other options and a way out is beyond our collective means. It's something we could do, and should do, we're just not doing a good job of it, yet. I suspect we will soon, as it's all bad, and it's becoming clearer and clearer. Making prostitution illegal is also bad, but it is not AS bad. I hope that within the next decade we will reverse the 2002 legislation and adopt the Swedish model, as it has shown itself to be the most successful. It doesn't prosecute sex workers, only those seeking them. That gives women the option to seek help without being punished for it, and it minimizes the demand to only those willing to break the law.

That's what I think about that.

Lewontin's fallacy, look it up bro.

&gt; In other words, you can take any group of random people, from around the world, and find an equal number of genetic markers that unite them than you'll find in any artificially created racial group

The onus is on you, prove those two statements are equivalent. Anyways,  I will take a pair of  monozygotic twins to be my artificially created racial group.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Alright, I'll give you corporations, but banks certainly aren't. After having gone through the financial crisis that spawned from the US, and now the one in the Eurozone, they really are struggling. That's part of the vicious cycle (actually, it's part of two of them).

The article you linked to mentioned a part of one already. When banks are short on cash, they don't lend to businesses, so those can't invest (read: buy machines from other companies and create jobs) or refinance their debt, which means more companies and unemployed default on their debt, which in turn causes banks to be short on cash.

The other one is even more destructive. When a bank runs out of cash, it needs recapitalization from the government, so government debt increases and its interest rates go up, thereby threatening the government's solvency -- and increasing the perceived risk that it might have to exit the Eurozone, which would mean devaluation of savings. So, customers move their savings elsewhere, which means the bank has less cash and might need a government bailout.

The banking union is supposed to interrupt this vicious cycle, and it's necessary, but if you've been following the discussion (the disagreement between Germany and France or the Swedish finance minister's recent comments), you know that we're already near the limit of the ""workable"" requirement.  
This vicious cycle is also the reason why they've decided to recapitalize the Spanish banks directly out of the ESM, and that Ireland (rightfully) points out that, if Spain gets such a deal, they should as well (like Spain, Ireland had only very low government debt, most of the one they have now is due to them having had to bail out their oversized financial sector), illustrates another workability issue with alternatives to austerity. If you give Greece a better deal, then you'd have to give a proportionally similar one to Portugal, and potentially Spain or others, should it become necessary in the future. This means that other countries who themselves might not be in a great position have to borrow more money to pay into the bailout funds, which drives up their own debt levels. All this is still disregarding the various political factors, of which the unpopularity of giving money to others is just one of several.

What this boils down to is that you're of course right that austerity isn't workable for the periphery, but the alternatives aren't workable for the core. The way the EU/Eurozone is currently structured, national parliaments have sovereignty over their budgets, which of course includes the money they provide to the bailout funds. In the end, what people call ""austerity"" is something like a shortage of the provided help by the other members, and the brutal reality of an EU/EZ without a fiscal and political union is that austerity becomes an automatic consequence of the lack of alternatives that are workable for the core.

So, no, it's clearly not a good way to go about this, just something like the default option among many bad ones, as long as no agreement to potential alternatives can be reached. ",0,1354790268,null,0,false,0,c7c48y2,t3_14azcp,t1_c7c48y2,t1_c7c3m8d,null,1430594587,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Due to the current organization of the economy (hierarchical corporations), an employer is put into a position where he can force other people to submit to his wants.

Trade is only free when all entities involved have the option not to partake in the trade.

Define person. Your definition of person is arbitrary and therefore irrational. Everybody can produce logically formulated gibberish.

That's correct. It was understood well enough since even before they made the decision that a common currency can only properly work within a fiscal union, and that if you want to make legitimate decisions within a fiscal union you also need a proper political union. But fiscal and political unions are hard, politically, and they didn't quite get around to working that part out twenty years ago. Or in the years between this decision and the introduction of the ECU. Or in the decade between then and the crisis. Just like Italy took a break with their reforms once they had met the accession criteria that had already been lowered. Democracies are really bad at making unpopular decisions in absence of a crisis, no matter how necessary, and as we can see, even then. For governments, it's always easier to leave that to their successors. (It's really not just Ireland, btw., this is almost universal. I've only mentioned them specifically because they made for a good example because of your point about low corporate taxes.)

The need to work on such a fiscal and political union now, while there is an obvious immediate need because of the crisis, is part of the political problems complex that I've tried to avoid above. The short version is that I fear we'll get another chance when the next crisis hits if we don't at least agree on a rough framework and schedule now, and the ugly realpolitik part of this thinking is that the leverage the bailout funds provide would make it considerably easier now than doing it later.  

This is actually something Merkel is pushing for, among others, and the European Commission is already at it. Maybe, just maybe, this crisis will have a bit of a constructive component among all the negative ones, after all. I wouldn't get my hopes up just yet, though.

If the woman wants to do the job, then I don't see a problem about it. And who am I to tell people to not get it on with a prostitute or to tell woman what they can do for money and what not?

About brothels: Without brothels, I couldn't play Nuttenbingo anymore (hooker bingo). There's a brothel right next to the rail roads to the Düsseldorf mainstation (coming from Oberbilk) and the windows have numbers below them and the prostitutes are sometimes standing in the window. You pick a number and of a prostitute is visible, you've won.

But let's get serious again.

If a brothel is not in view of a school or Kindergarten, I don't have a problem with that. The brothel also shouldn't try to get win the fathers waiting outside the school for their children as customers. Keep it classy.

Apart from that, my father just bought a house right next to a brothel. He and my stepmother went over there and introduced themselves as the new neighbours. The brothel owner offered a beer and they had a little chat. Nothing to worry about. They are nice people so why should I worry? Maybe about the children?

Ah, sorry, good catch on the nationalism/racism mistake. So let's just categorize it as pure and simple hate crime.

The previous government was incompetent, corrupt as usual (real estate scandals, EU tender embezzlement, business as usual nepotism and cronyism), but at least wasn't hostile as this one, which gained a total majority and instead of real reforms it just proceeded to practically cast their friends in every position, office and committee imaginable. Also, and there is a serious difference between mixed ideological economic policy and straight-to-the-wall head-on collision course with reality, basically defrauding the IMF and the populace.

It is very very hard to find cheap apartments in Paris. You will have a hard time finding a place within Paris city limits for 450-500 a month unless you are very lucky or share a room. But long commutes will make your school life miserable so if I were you I'd go after location first when choosing a place. Don't forget that university food is really cheap so if you eat your meals there or at other universities (you can usually go to any), you can save a lot of money.

Try going to the neighborhood you want and looking on bakery and grocery store bulletin boards. Tell people you are looking (concierges etc.). If you are willing to share, look in FUSAC http://www.fusac.fr/en/ and Craigslist Paris. Also try the bulletin boards in churches (English- and French-speaking) -- the American Church on the Quai d'Orsay is known for this.

The knowledge that the women have been exploited, coerced, pimped, or trafficked failed to deter sex buyers from buying sex. Many of the sex buyers had used women who were controlled by pimps at the time they used her for sex.

Much of this debt greece owes can be classified as Odious debt, that it was created either a very long time ago . . as far as Pre WW1 . . . or the debt was created not in the best interests of the country with astronomical interest rates.

Germany is not the innocent ""good guy"" giving away money like charity which the EU media likes to portray(propaganda).

This is how it works.

Germany gives money in these so called ""bail-outs"" to greece. Not a dime of this money goes to assist greece in any way. 100% of this money is used to pay off debts to German banks who loaned the money to greece. 

This debt itself is loaded with extremely high interest rates which created further debt.

THe following year a new bailout is given which creates more debt . . etc . . until the debt is so massive it becomes unpayable.

Germany and Greece make a deal last week where Germany in a sign of good will . . ""shave"" off a portion of the debt in return for access to the Natural Gas reserves located in Greece.

So now . . after 4 years of stacking debt relentlessly onto Greece . . Greece itself is 500 billion euros in debt . . . and coincidentally Germany are now reporting today that they have found 500 billion euros in Natural Gas in Greece.

The ambassador was a man of Serb ethnicity, working full-time on keeping contact with an organization that systematically treats people from the Balkans differently with regards to ethnicity (and primarily which attitude their political leadership had towards NATO influence). Crimes against some ethnicities were treated differently than crimes against others.

You may shout Milosevic and Karadzic all you want, but NATO does not follow the UN principle *""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights [...]"".* The work environment of the ambassador could arguably be a very depressing place if you are born of the ""wrong"" mother and father.

And I would be glad if we could have a discussion around this instead of throwing downvotes (I should maybe state that I do not support any nationalist, fascist or communist interests, just to make myself clear).

You can visit the KZ Buchenwald, it's not that far away.

Some regular events: Schwarzbiernacht (Beer night), Jazzfrühling (Jazz Spring), Irish Days, Christmas market, Altstadtfest, Kulturarena (a 7 week long open air music festival)

Visit some football games (try to visit Carl Zeiss Jena vs. Rot Weiß Erfurt).

Night Life: Just look for the *Wagnergasse*. Many Pubs, Cafes, student clubs, some night clubs near the centrum

It's mostly college folks, the city has about 100k living in it, and just about everyone is in the FSU (Friedrich-Schiller Universität) or works in a related field. Relativly nice and intact old city, surrounded by horrible east-german satellitetowns (I guess youd'd call those ""the projects""). General area is extremly lovely, to the north is germanys most northern wine-cultivating area, which runs along the river Saale. Jena is situated in the Valley of that river, and is surrounded on all sides by sandstone hills that form plateaus. Almost all these ""cliffs"" hat towers or restaurants on them. To the south endless hills and forests with castles in them. History all around you - and important one at that. Think Martin Luther, Johann Wolfgang Goethe and Friedrich Schiller. Think the Weimar Republic, the Reformation or even the Battle of Jena next door.

The city itself is dominated by student life, so being a foreigner is probably an advantage. The surrounding area might not be as appreciative and was considered a neo-nazi stronghold until a few years back (although most people would consider that be behind both Jena and the region by now). Tram service runs all night, drink is cheap as hell. Berlin takes 2,5 hours and costs around 17 € one way if you use one of the ride-shares. Frankfurt is about the same. Prag is just 3,5 hours, dresden and leipzig are just around the corner. You'll be in the middle of it all.

It's the most friendly town in eastern germany I've come across, and I mean genuine friendliness, not acted hospitality. The locals will let you know if they like you, and they will be very blunt about it. I like it that way, i'd even say I can't stand it any other way - but YMMV. Some might say it's been overrun by students from western germany and all over the world - but I like it that way as well.

Nationalstolz ist eine Sache, die nur gegeben sein sollte, bei unkonditioneller Richtigkeit des Staates, der Gesetzgebung und des ausführenden Arm des Staates. Zumindest laut meiner Meinung. Zusätzlich können wir uns nicht nur als Power Haus der Europäischen Union betrachten, sondern auch als eines der Länder, dass es geschafft hat viele internationale Beziehungen aufzubauen, ohne dass ein Großteil der Bevölkerung hinter jeder Entscheidung des Staates steht und jubelt. 

Deutschland hat, aufgrund seiner Vergangenheit, eine sehr gespaltene Beziehung zum Nationalstolz und hat vieles Vollbracht ohne irgendeine beweihräucherung unserer Herkunft in unserer Generation. 

Eine gegebene kritische Auseinandersetzung sollte zu jedem zeitpunkt gegeben sein, was mir mit überschwinglicher patriotischer Einstellung flöten geht. Ich bin Deutscher, ich lebe in diesem Staat mit allen Pro und Kontras, was für mich aber nicht bedeutet, dass Nationalstolz sein sollte, oder sein muss. 

Eine klare distanzierung zum Land und zur Regierung bedeutet immer eine objektive Anschauung der Taten, die von der Regierung verübt werden, sowohl unter wechselnder Führung, Koalitionen, non-politischen Entscheidungen, als auch unter ""Angriffen"" anderer Länder gegenüber der deutschen Regierungen.

Wir sind eine Generation, die überlebt, ohne großartiges Fahneschwenken, oder ähnliches. Wieso einen großartigen Wert auf die Flagge, oder den Nationalstolz geben, wenn man im Endeffekt doch in größten Teilen hedonistisch denkt und so sehr viel veräußerlicht, was andere Leute unter Nationalstolz, oder Patriotismus verstehen? 

Gegebene Möglichkeiten und der Wunsch, nachkommenden Generationen innerhalb der Grenze das Gleiche zu ermöglichen, ist für mich wichtiger, als dass es Deutschlands Wille, oder Deutschlands berufung ist, dies zu tun.

Not really sure about what you meant there.

Anyhow. As for the consequences of not electing anyone, they basically mean for most of us having to deal with the most drastic conditions of a lifetime. We are quite coping thanks to the real reason thanks to whom nothing really awful happened this far: general distrust for banks and finance and tendency to store away the money in the safest way possible. Private savings have alway been huge (we are talking billions), and this peasant-like mindset has been providing us a little shelter from the shitstorm. Little credit to Silvio for having messed with it as little as possible, but not very much more than that.

As for those who are going to be elected instead of Berlusconi. Chances, enforced by the almost certainty of the election law staying the same, are that we are going to elect someone: the center-left (at the moment more left than center, to be exact) coalition is pretty sure to win the elections. Nobody can tell how long will ti last, how effective it will be, what toll it will have to pay (in terms of running ministers to somehow redeploy, current political strategies to stay true to, role to grant to Monti etc.) to the cabinet in charge.

So this is basically a quote within a quote and not an *order* We all know those passages. What makes the difference is why do they exist, in what historical context were they revealed and whom are they addressed to. Many people, terrorists for instance, misunderstand these passages because of their lack of tafsir (exegese)knowledge and consider them as ""'aam"" (general rules) which is not the case because those verses were revealed during war times and the ennemies of the muslims back in the days were quite obviously ""nonmuslims"".

Also theres been some trouble becuase there was a stampede on a similar party on halloween, 5 kids died and it became a witch hunt against clubs and event managment companies, so higher prices and more problems are expected.

As for foodie stuff, La latina has tons of small bars and restorants with different themes, its the avant guard area of madrid now, sol is a avoid area for foodies as most restorants carry a ""guiri"" tax (guiri is a derogative term for forigners, usualy refering to north europeans and americans) and everything is more expencive, but i do recommend the san miguel food market behind plaza mayor, its a renovated old food market, its VERY expencive becuase its mainly concived as a fancy/tourist food market,  while you´re there check plaza mayor aswell, the opera building and you´re 2 steps from the royal palace, if you also feel like it go up to plaza de españa and from there templo debod which is a old egyptian temple brought stone by stone from egypt to madrid. 

The other touristy food market is the San Anton market right off the plaza de chueca, Chueca use to be a ghetto for junkies and crime untill a couple of decades ago the gay community moved in and basicly cleaned up the area, its very avant guard with interesting stores, restorants, cafe places and a few nice plazas with alot of small clubs or bars, just mind which one you step in to ;). 

Chueca, and plaza de sol are connected by a street called funcareal. it runs from plaza de bilbao to gran via (which then you go down montera, a street famous for prostitution, but its being cleaned up, which leads you straight to sol), Funcareal is a predestrian only street starting from gran via around 6-8 blocks down and close to tribunal it becomes transitable for cars too, its very interesting has some decent bars and also has alot of fashion shops, the interesting thing about funcareal is how it branches out in to little strees which are full of restorants, bars and interesting shops, its parallel hortaleza is also full of them, and you have the malasaña bar area to the right and chueca to the left going down funcareal, malasaña is further down while chueca is much nearer, and both are worth exploring. 

As usual, the travel around town advice...

Do NOT use a car in central madrid, parking is hard and expencive usualy. and the smaller streets in the city center are hard to navigate if you dont know them, if you wish to explore the suburbs you can use the cercanias (commuter train) which reaches alcala de henares, el escorial or toledo but a car would make things smoother, 

http://www.pepecar.com/

these guys will rent you a car from 7,50€ a day but consider that the price is basicly and might start going up once you include taxes, insurance and little details, Gasoline is currently around 5 euros a gallon (1.34 a litre) but can move up or down up to 5 cents a day. 


98% of the city is acceisble by metro or bus, a metro ticket is between 1,50€ and 2.00€ depending on how many stops you travel, the 10 ride ticket is 12,20 and is good for the bus aswell, depending on how long you´ll be in madrid and how much you think you´re going to use the metro the unlimited use tourist pass (zone A only), is 8 euros for 1 day, 13,40 for 2, 17.40 for 3, 25,40 for 5 and 33,40 for a week, Take in to account that its personal and can only be used by one person, its usualy blocked for 15 minutes after every use to avoid fraud and can be confiscated if misused, 



For a real proper spanish food market that isnt made for tourists you should go to mercado maravillas, Cuatro Caminos metro station, you take bravo murillo in direction to plaza castilla it should be directly on the right, Also bravo murillo is a classic comercial street in madrid filled with clothing shops,

true,Aschebescher,GERM,Hesse,"&gt; does the heroinist steal because he wants to and is a bad person or because he suffers from an addiction. Just the same you can ask yourself if someone likes giving several blowjobs/day and have sex with various men because she is a slut, or maybe if one should try to help her/him because something is not right.

People who are addicted to heroin have already proven that they don't care about the law. If they need money they will prostitute themself if it is illegal or not. I agree that these people need help, but making prostitution illegal doesn't help them in the slightest.

&gt; But I am sure you can find someone who says they chooses it. Speak to them for a while though, and you will discover that their choices were very limited.

I think in countries where prostitution is legal you can find out that almost all of the women choose to do it on their own. Even if their ""choices are very limited"" how does it help to limit it even more? Prostitutes are not victims by default. Many of them enjoy the job or enjoy the money or both.

&gt; I am on my phone, so I can't link, but I have no statistic over the violence against prostitutes in DE/SWE but I haven't heard that it is less, which it should be with your logic. 

Just because you think this is the case doesn't make it true. If you can show me facts about this I will believe you but until then this is just worthless speculation. Also, why should men be especially violent to prostitutes? Men that are respectful to other women like waitresses or whatever won't turn violent just because they meet a prostitute.

&gt; What I do know is that more men (since men are the bulk of the buyers) visits prostitutes in Germany compared to Sweden, thus continuing a cycle of (self) abuse for the prostitute.

Again, legal prostitution is not abuse. The women here in Germany do this on their own will. They get their health checked every other week, pay taxes and if someone doesn't treat them right they can call the police and even sue. They are protected by the law.

And I only mentioned the notable military actions here. But in the end, France is constantly on military missions, especially in its ex-colonies in Africa.

France has the 4rth or 5th military budget in the world, after the US (which is way above everyone else), China, Russia, and depending on the estimates, the UK (but France and the UK are pretty much tied).

France has important political interests and influence, especially in its ex-colonies, and access to precious minerals and investment deals with governments which it doesn't intend on losing, be it to the Chinese, to rebel forces, or whatnot. While its leading role against Libya, and now against the Syrian government, happens to be ethically on the ""good"" side, chances are the French government figured they would benefit from taking these crazies out because they've become too unreliable and a hassle - although these governments weren't an issue decades before - but presumably France wants a piece of the pie once these dictatorships fall, which is normal because few countries would spend millions, if not billions, on distant war efforts if they didn't gain anything in return.

EU law is basically international law. (OK, directives get internalised by each country's Parliament, but that flows from international law as well.)

And ketosis doesn't really melt fat so much as trigger the process for the body to start burning it (as opposed to other, easier fuels).

I also have doubts about your claim that fats trigger satiety, relative to other foods at least.

edit: Got curious, looked up the fat satiety claim. Here's what I found:

&gt;However, when given in equal volumes, **carbohydrate (sugar) and fat have similar effects on hunger, satiety**, and subsequent food intake when infused intragastrically or ingested in foods by normal-weight, unrestrained young men. **In obese and restrained subjects, preloads of high-carbohydrate yogurts suppress subsequent food intake more than do high-fat yogurts, indicating a relative insensitivity to the satiety value of fat.**

true,mojojo42,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt; tl;dr What you said is only true within the UK domestic legal system.

The UK does not have a single domestic legal system, it has three. EU directives are, as you say, internalised - however within the UK this is done separately by the Scottish parliament (to transpose them into Scots law) vs Westminster (for the rest of the UK: I'm not sure what happens with Stormont).

The relationship between the EU and the UK is that of a member state, but that is a tautology: the EU is a collection of member states, so the distinction between a nation state (France) and a generic ""state"" (UK) is not made.

The UK is a slightly unusual case (I am not sure if it is unique, but am struggling to think of another) where it is clearly a state - however it is also clearly not a nation state (it is composed of four countries, and has three entirely separate legal systems).

There have been instances where the Scottish government has submitted responses directly to the EC (I believe they did so for the Europe 2020 consultation), although primarily they interact through the UK (as you would expect: the UK is capable of saying ""this is our position on X, and it's being driven by Scotland"").

So the rights and obligations Scotland has as part of the EU have been contracted by the UK, but if you assume independence is voted for you are now left with two states where there were one before. The process by which that happened was that a union of two countries was disolved, not that one part of a country announced they wished to create a new country.

The question is how you incorporate that reality: even if you designate rUK as the ""successor state"", the obligations of that state will have to change too. E.g., 60% of the UK's fishing catch is in Scotland, so you could imagine a case where rUK had some obligation under the CFP that it could no longer fulfil (those obligations were negotiated for Scotland by the UK acting as an umbrella organisation, so the logical way to proceed is that Scotland should continue to be bound by whatever aspects affect it and rUK should be released from whatever obligations no longer affect it).

But now Romania has bad PR in Poland, mainly because it's stereotypically where Cyganie (Roma) comes from. And most Poles don't even remember that Poland was allied with Romania. It's sad how many stereotypes can form in such short time (since 1989).

Poles, in turn, have soft spot for Ireland, even if we never really interact with each other (at least before 2004 ;), and this soft spot is much earlier, at least since early XX century). I think it comes from both countries being traditionally Catholic, occupied by non-Catholic neighbors for huge part of their history, and fighting for freedom often.

Many Ukrainians come to Poland recently to work and the nations are getting to know each other. I was absolutely stunned when I first heard a native Ukrainian talking... it sounded so similar to Polish, I could almost understand it completely. It's even more like Polish than Czech or Slovak. Unfortunately, there is this notion and stereotype of Ukrainian as of brute, thief, stupid and only able to do physical work (I think some of you might recognize the stereotype of Pole that's held in the West...). That's beginning to change though. Some celebrities were insluting the Ukrainians recently and the public opinion got really mad at them and they lost their jobs -- I hope that this is the turning point for Polish attitude towards Ukrainians.

25% of it is weather exposure. When I commuted by car, all that was different in my wardrobe per season was just the jacket.

Technically the Maastricht treaty also obligates Sweden to adopt the Euro, but they have used a similar route to defer this decision until such time as public opinion changes.

Given the amount of cross-border interaction there would be with rUK, Scotland formally adopting the Euro would only really be practical if and when rUK adopts it too.

The division of the UK between different entities you choose to call ""countries"" is indeed irrelevant to international law, no matter how big an importance you attach to it internally. That is IL (International Law) 101, and I think I made it clear from the start I'm speaking solely from the point of view of IL.

Given that unconventional distribution of powers within the UK, let's not call it (or France, or Spain, or any other State) a State any more: the technical term in IL is that these sovereign entities are ""IL subjects"". So, again I affirm: from the point of view of IL subjects generally, the way other subjects divide their internal powers is irrelevant, as it is a matter of their own internal sovereignty. It is also irrelevant whether they are considered ""nation-States"", ""plurinational States"", federations, confederations, federal States, ""cooperative republics"" or anything else; in what regards IL, its subjects are just that - IL subjects. These titles and distinctions are relevant only in the realm of internal law, politics and perhaps sociology; they don't pertain to IL.

Not being European, I didn't know it was Holyrood which internalised EU directives or that the Scottish Government talked directly to the EC. However, I am fairly confident that Edinburgh was **not** given that power directly by Brussels, but by Westminster (and it is not unimaginable that other countries, e.g. Belgium, also gave their national power to do that to their regions). That power originally belongs to Westminster (likely, but you'll probably know better, by the 1707 Act of Union); since it is theirs, they can do anything they want with it - including giving it to Holyrood.

&gt;So the rights and obligations Scotland has as part of the EU have been contracted by the UK, but if you assume independence is voted for you are now left with two states where there were one before. The process by which that happened was that a union of two countries was disolved, not that one part of a country announced they wished to create a new country.

Wrong, wrong. Scotland is not an IL subject in some form of association with the UK; it is a part of the IL subject called UK. If it decides to secede from that IL subject, it becomes a new one called Scotland and the other one will still be the same IL subject as before. This is not like, say, the Velvet Divorce, where (AFAIK) the IL subject called Czechoslovakia was dissolved and two new ones arose. What the British Government have agreed to is to allow Scotland out of the Union if it so chooses, not to dissolve the Union (which, since 1801, isn't just a Union between Scotland and England any more). Yes, there is a difference.

To see that there is a difference, you need only think of a couple questions: if Scotland leaves, is Northern Ireland still in the Union? Obviously, yes; then, it logically follows that the Union still exists. Also: if Scotland has some sort of automatic right to be in the EU, does it also have a right to a permanent seat in the UN Security Council? As a citizen of a country which aspires to a permanent seat (Brazil), let me tell you that idea would be simply ridiculous, and I don't think you'd affirm that. Now, the UN and the EU are (again, from an IL point of view) entities of the same nature: they are international organisations formed by agreements between IL subjects. The fact that the subjects making up the EU gave their treaty-born creature much more power (called supra-nationality) than they and the others gave the UN doesn't change that.

&gt;even if you designate rUK as the ""successor state"",

You don't have to ""designate"" it; it **is** the successor IL subject because at no point is it even considering abolishing its existence as such. It is just considering relinquishing the sovereignty it currently has over a part of its territory, like it has done countless times before to give the colonies independence.

&gt;the obligations of that state will have to change too.

That is obvious. As I said, whatever obligations arise from territory are linked to that territory, not to the successor IL subject. You go on saying that...

&gt;E.g., 60% of the UK's fishing catch is in Scotland, so you could imagine a case where rUK had some obligation under the CFP that it could no longer fulfil (those obligations were negotiated for Scotland by the UK acting as an umbrella organisation, so the logical way to proceed is that Scotland should continue to be bound by whatever aspects affect it and rUK should be released from whatever obligations no longer affect it).

Yes, you are sort of right. But the details of what exactly would be the rUK's rights and obligations within the EU are one question, to be decided between the 27 member IL subjects of that organisation; given that, *a priori*, the new non-member IL subject of Scotland would still not have been admitted, it would have no say regarding that. On the other hand, it would have the capacity, inherent to being an IL subject, to negotiate its rights and obligations in its Treaty of Accession. Actually, if London decides to be cooperative with the whole process, these negotiations could be carried over even before secession; if everyone in the EU agrees, the UK can split in two member States, without Scotland ever being left out of the EU. But - and this is my point throughout - **that would NOT be automatic, because Scotland has no right to impose that on the EU members**. No IL subject has the legal right to impose anything on another; why on Earth would an entity which isn't even an IL subject have such a right??

&gt;I don't think there are many parallels to draw with Catalonia; I would suggest that the idea of a Spanish veto preventing Scottish independence is something that's heard much more in the UK than in the rest of the EU.

Now that's a political consideration which, given my focus on IL here, I will not discuss neither to agree nor to disagree with.

&gt;The EU is not a static thing: the existing rules on parliament seats and voting would obviously not be sustainable if every member state split into fifty (say), but they could clearly accomodate this situation even if longer-term reform was needed.

And the way the EU evolves, the way they would accommodate this or any other such situation, is according to IL, which clearly specifies who is and who isn't a subject and what they can and cannot do.",0,1354878583,null,0,false,0,c7co3ev,t3_14dqhy,t1_c7co3ev,t1_c7cnqwp,null,1430604572,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Yes, i've been to Belgrad and Budapest, also Burgas, Istanbul, Ankara, Malatya and other turkish towns where there's plenty of the machismo you like so much. I think it's medieval, martial and brute, might is right and such. 
In Malatya they could build a few tramways and reduce the traffic a ton. Instead the ""public transport"" is done by privately run mini-busses who drive at crazy speeds, the government simply ignores public transport in this fast growing urban areas. 
As a pedestrian you have to jump if a car approaches, they are not used to brake if a pedestrian crosses the street, on a crosswalk mind you! That's the kind of culture you like, is it?

To give you a contrast - have you ever been to cities like Toulouse, Kopenhagen or Groningen? Wide areas of the inner cities are reserved for pedestrians and cyclists, if cars are allowed, they are limited to a slow speed. You have to see how peaceful and lively these cities are to get the full picture.

We humans are intelligent enough to use more distinguished, sensible and empathic forms to bond a society together than the right of might.

Cars are loud(That's the worst), they stink and they drive at speeds in the city that humans are barely able to control in a critical situation.

true,multubunu,ROMA,România,"&gt;I'm not sure about ""ungur"" though. I think it existed alongside ""maghiar"" all the time.

In Ardeal, perhaps. I don't think the term 'maghiar' had any circulation in either Moldavia or Valahia.

I found Miron Costin at wikisource. In the [Letopiset](http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Letopise%C8%9Bul_%C8%9A%C4%83r%C3%AEi_Moldovei_de_la_Aaron_Vod%C4%83_%C3%AEncoace) and [De Neamul Moldovenilor](http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/De_neamul_moldovenilor) _combined_, there is a single instance of the word 'maghiar' (in the latter), while ungur and family - 126. So it's safe to say that, while ~~Neculce~~ Costin knew the endonym, he much preferred the local exonym.

Also, 'Ungurean', meaning 'from the country of the Unguri', was used instead of Ardelean.

(edit): Here's the context for that unique mention of 'maghiar':

&gt;Așa toate neamurile suptŭ multe numere toate suntŭ. Ungurii: huni, maghiari, ugrii

(All peoples are known under many names. The Hungarians (Ungurii): huns, magyars, ugri)

Yes, he definitely knew the endonym, but only used 'ungur' himself.

Means: screwing the residents who live outside the zone

&gt; and it will discourage them to commute by car.

How does putting a price on leaving the car before the home actually discourage not leaving it there and commuting with it?...

&gt;To give you a contrast - have you ever been to cities like Toulouse, Kopenhagen or Groningen? 

Kopenhagen yes. Come to think of it was an even more low energy, low testosterone place. I was in a party in someone's house. Even though people were young, there was no chugging whisky and blasting metal or techno, it was drinking weak punch or bowl or what, some guy playing a guitar softly and just chatting.  This bicycle culture was really weird given that they don't even have a suitable weather for that. Although it helps that the city is flat.

&gt;As a pedestrian you have to jump if a car approaches, they are not used to brake if a pedestrian crosses the street, on a crosswalk mind you! That's the kind of culture you like, is it?

They just need to look around before they step down the street. The road does not belong to them, the same way as the sidewalk does not belong to cars, how it is not fair? At any rate I absolutely prefer prioritizing cars above pedestrians given that car drivers on the average have a higher social class. So it is just logical. 

&gt;Cars are loud(That's the worst),

That's true, this is one of the reason I like to live as rural/suburbian as I can afford.

That's the whole thrill!

No, as rural/suburbian as possible.

But I can see your point of view. Really if you see the city as something you live in your viewpoint is understandable. I see it as a place where my job is located, I would much prefer it moved out to the industrial zones. As a rural/suburbian type of course I prefer low traffic here, and can accept the city dwellers prefer that, my point is, I never wanted anything from the city other than a job, it isn't really my fault that the best paid jobs tend to be inside.

Hallo,

ich bin auf der Suche nach Heinz.

Die Hintergrundgeschichte:

Ein guter Freund von mir hatte leider keine sehr schöne Kindheit. (Ich werde nicht ins Detail gehen um seine Privatsphäre zu schützen) Er ist einer der fleißigsten, sanftesten, freundlichsten und einfach guten Menschen. Er vermied es damals so oft wie möglich nach Hause zu gehen und hat stattdessen seine Freizeit nach Schulschluss in einem Jugendtreff verbracht. Dort lernte er das erste und einzige männliche Vorbild seiner ansonsten traurigen Kindheit kennen.

Nun würde ich meinem Freund gerne die Möglichkeit geben wieder Kontakt zu seinem Kindheits-Vorbild herzustellen. Entweder um wieder Kontakt aufzunehmen oder auch um einfach nur Danke zu sagen. Was auch immer für beide okay ist.

Die aktuelle Situation:

Mein Freund zog noch als Kind weg und hat seitdem jeglichen Kontakt verloren. Leider hat er sich seit damals auch nur wenige Informationen merken können.

Alle Details die ich habe sind:

- sein Name ist Heinz

- er arbeitete in einem Jugendtreff

- der Jugendtreff war sehr wahrscheinlich in Buchholz nahe Hamburg. Obwohl eine kleine Chance besteht, dass diese Information falsch sein könnte

- Dies alles hat sich ca. zwischen 1992-1998 abgespielt. Möglicherweise auch etwas früher

Wenn sie also möglicherweise Heinz sind, oder Heinz kennen, oder einfach nur irgendwelche Tipps haben die mir auf meiner Suche weiterhelfen könnten, melden sie sich bitte.

Ich würde dies unglaublich gerne für meinen Freund zu Weihnachten möglich machen. Ich bin mir sicher, dass es ihm viel bedeutet.",0,1354886670,null,0,1354890188,0,c7coyko,t3_14fkbp,t1_c7coyko,t3_14fkbp,null,1430604979,9,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,9

true,mojojo42,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt; The division of the UK between different entities you choose to call ""countries"" is indeed irrelevant to international law, no matter how big an importance you attach to it internally. That is IL (International Law) 101, and I think I made it clear from the start I'm speaking solely from the point of view of IL.

I think perhaps you are interpreting things too rigidly - IL is how states manage their relationships with each other, but it is not the only means by which they do so (nor is it a single definitive codex). IL (or in this case Supranational Law) is as open to change as any other human endeavour.

If your starting position is that Scotland (and England) are not commonly recognised as sovereign entities then you are correct; Scotland no more has a seat at the UN than England does - their seat is ""shared"", in the sense that the person who sits there represents both (neither Scotland nor England ""exist"" in that sense, only the entity known as the UK does).

If your starting position is ""is Scotland a country?"" or ""is England a country?"" then I think most non-lawyers would say ""yes, obviously"". If you ask ""is Catalonia a country?"" then I think the answer would probably be different.

Assuming independence passes, Scotland would move from the latter category to the former. How it does that would need to be determined, but if that is what people decide they want to do then that is what would happen.

IMO Scotland currently has a kind of quasi-state existence: it has recognised borders, its own legal system, control over its own social systems (education, healthcare, police services, etc are all separate), some control over its government, some form of external recognition, etc. All of these attributes apply to England (and Wales, and NI) too.

&gt; Wrong, wrong. Scotland is not an IL subject in some form of association with the UK; it is a part of the IL subject called UK. If it decides to secede from that IL subject, it becomes a new one called Scotland and the other one will still be the same IL subject as before.

I disagree, but I think we will have to agree to disagree. It is not at all clear to me that the rUK (for want of a better description for ""rest of the UK"") would necessarily be considered ""the same"" subject as before.

&gt; This is not like, say, the Velvet Divorce, where (AFAIK) the IL subject called Czechoslovakia was dissolved and two new ones arose. What the British Government have agreed to is to allow Scotland out of the Union if it so chooses, not to dissolve the Union (which, since 1801, isn't just a Union between Scotland and England any more). Yes, there is a difference.

There is a difference, but I think you are incorrect. The UK government are not required to ""allow"" Scotland out of the Union, any more than their consent was needed for American or Irish independence (the idea that independence requires approval is somewhat self-defeating).

&gt; To see that there is a difference, you need only think of a couple questions: if Scotland leaves, is Northern Ireland still in the Union? Obviously, yes; then, it logically follows that the Union still exists.

There is not ""a union"". There have been several - one between Scotland and England (to form the Kingdom of Great Britain), then one between KGB and the Kingdom of Ireland to create the UK as we know it today (Wales was essentially subsumed into the Kingdom of England).

One of those unions was dissolved in 1962 (with Ireland; Northern Ireland was essentially retained without an explicit union), and independence for Scotland would dissolve the other (by mutual agreement).

&gt; Also: if Scotland has some sort of automatic right to be in the EU, does it also have a right to a permanent seat in the UN Security Council?

I do not believe so, no (I do not think most people in the UK would assume that they would either). A more interesting question is if rUK would continue to have that right - they would be about 10% smaller by population, and would have lost their deep-water nuclear submarine deterrent (the Scottish government's policy is that those weapons, which are all sited in Scotland, would be removed), so although they are likely to receive US support their influence will be reduced.

The UK has a great number of relationships like this where their position made sense historically - but given our now much reduced influence in the world (and the rise of bodies like the EU), I do not think it is sustainable.

&gt; Now, the UN and the EU are (again, from an IL point of view) entities of the same nature: they are international organisations formed by agreements between IL subjects. The fact that the subjects making up the EU gave their treaty-born creature much more power (called supra-nationality) than they and the others gave the UN doesn't change that.

Yes and no. It does not change things from the point of view of entities like the UN (or Brazil), but it does change things from the point of view of the rest of the EU.

The five million people living in Scotland are currently EU citizens, and benefit from the freedom of movement and labour that the EU was founded on (as do other member states whose citizens or businesses trade with or migrate to Scotland). If Scotland decides it no longer wishes to be part of the UK, but still be part of the EU (a great deal of the anti-EU sentiment that's associated with the UK is more correctly associated with specific right-wing parties in the UK: these parties are historically not popular in Scotland), what should the solution be?

I think the idea of ejecting them is ludicrous: there are plenty of instances where the EU has shown great flexibility in how it interprets its own treaties, and pragmatism seems to be the underlying thread.

From the point of view of non-EU relationships, yes, Scotland would be starting ""from scratch"". Although I think that exaggerates it, as I suspect many existing relationships are handled through the EU and many others would be done with a ""let's assume you're like a smaller UK until things diverge"" (trade agreements are typically handled by the EU - entities like the UN are the exception, entities like NATO are an example of where things would be similar in character to the existing UK relationship).

From the point of view of relationships with the rest of the EU, I think it's more plausible than not that there will be some interpretation that the UK's member status was as an umbrella organisation and that Scotland is allowed some kind of ""when conditions are right"" leeway over issues like Schengen (as per UK) or the Euro (as per Sweden) but for as many cases as possible they simply duplicate the UK interactions.

The kind of thing that I think would change are things like the UK's rebate - this was introduced as a way to make the EU more attractive to Eurosceptic UK politicians (Thatcher; who was extremely unpopular in Scotland), so I would not expect Scotland to inherit that (and in return would get some fixed-term assurances over development funds).

I do not think any Scottish politician is expecting that the process would simply be saying ""right, we're independent, where's our EC seat?"".

But conversely we are in the EU today, we want to be in the EU tomorrow, so is it really sensible to say ""no, only the part of the UK that's planning to have a referendum on exiting the EU gets to stay - you have to go…""?

Yes, other member states would have views on the subject and would want their opinions to be considered. But that's politics: some may want additional concessions for their support, some may want a stick to beat rUK with, some may want to encourage the EU to be formed of greater numbers of smaller states, etc, etc.",0,1354886914,null,0,false,0,c7cozrf,t3_14dqhy,t1_c7cozrf,t1_c7co3ev,null,1430604995,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Maybe you just have bad breath? Seriously though, acetone on the breath tends to come from an excess of the decarboxylation of ketones, sure, but that's not to say that the body undergoes ketosis overnight. I can't tell you any specific reason your body is producing lots of acetone unless you're either sick or are maintaining a diet which is free or nearly free of carbohydrates in the medium term.

Lets face it, back in the day (yes I know) European nations were all superpowers in comparison to the rest of the world, the only bigger dogs on the block were the USSR and the USA of which both were more allies than enemies.

The EU formed after european superpowers annihilated each other in WW2, that was over 60 years ago, the europe of today and during that time preceding the EU by 40 years was not what it used to be pre WW2

We had the Cold War between the Soviet Union and USA, Europe was just a buffer zone in this time as relevant as saying Turkey was still a threat because of the Ottoman Empire, I'm afraid Europe had lost most of its influence after WW2 and the rise of the new Warsaw Pact and later NATO dominated by the USA.

To say that the EU lead to ""eternal peace"" above all else is plain ignorance and lack of historical and global political understanding, the real reason for peace in Europe if anything is NATO and the decline of european power from succession of colonial colonies of which provided Europe with most of its wealth, we cant afford a war and wouldn't start one because of NATO binding us in defence terms
