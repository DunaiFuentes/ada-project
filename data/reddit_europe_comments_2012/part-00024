1. To protect the common people from the criminals.
2. To reform the criminals so that they may become functioning members of society once they are released.

The right to liberty, free assembly etc. must necessarily be taken away in order for the penal system to satisfy these two conditions. The right to vote, however, need not be taken away, and so it shouldn’t. Criminals should retain as many rights as possible, as long as the two aforementioned conditions are met.

The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

The US Federalists made good points. And they had good reason to confederate and centralise power. But the anti-Federalists were right as well: beware the encroachment of government in your lives.

That's the thing about US gov't and the bizarre relationship Americans have with theirs. Their distrust of gov't isn't unfounded. Federalism in the US is a mess. Take my mom, for an example. She's an American, born in the 30's. She remembers the New Deal quite well and like many of her generation, were wary of social security.

Now social insurance isn't the problem. The problem is that it was meant to be paid for and used by certain people for a certain purpose. Now, it's grown to encompass other things - supplemental income, disability. Not just retirement. It's expensive and it's broke. Why? Because like any unaccountable federal construct, it grew beyond it's scope. The Federalist left/Democrats had a good idea, but the anti-Federalist libertarians were right yet again: things grow and because they're federal, you can't stop them.

Alternate scenario: I live in Quebec. We run our own healthcare, just like every other province. Ottawa does not. We have our own pension plan, the rest of Canada has a different one. And of course we have social insurance.

Do you see the difference? We may have a federal mandate for certain things, or a federal law establishing rights or responsibilities, but the Federal gov't doesn't run these things. In the US, the pension programme is broken because it grew to encompass other things. That is the inherent flaw of federalism. 

You see it here in Canada. We're getting a boondoggle of F-35 jets. The Americans are selling civil rights wholesale for border protection. Americans are not stupid. Canadians aren't stupid. We're no different than Europeans in that regard. Where we're different is that we're saddled by onerous federal gov't that cannot help itself. The big debate in Canada is spending money on federal prisons we don't need. Even the Americans tell us we're wrong. They know!

But that's what happens.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"One important reason why this crisis is so dangerous is that EU/EZ members are economically entangled, and this is especially true for the financial sector. The exact same effects that had made it necessary for Ireland and other countries to bail out the banks would have made yet more bank bailouts necessary in the rest of Europe, had Ireland and/or its banks defaulted, and this would have caused other countries to get into the same kind of trouble Ireland got into. Note how Spain and Italy are on the brink even without this additional shock. The whole contagion and credit default swap thing has been explained over and over again by now, so I won't go there.

The point is, letting the Irish banks and/or the Irish government go bankrupt would almost certainly have spread the exact same problem throughout Europe, and this would have affected pretty much everybody. No banks, no credit, no investments into growing businesses, no new jobs. That's not even the whole problem, even perfectly healthy companies have to refinance debt all the time, and if there is no credit then they go bankrupt because they can't pay back the loans that come due, which means that jobs are being lost. So it would have had effects far beyond the financial sector, and there is no entity that is large enough to bail out all of Europe.  
Yes, those affected include PRIVATE investors from France and Germany, or at least those of them who had invested in bonds etc. instead of ~~betting on~~ insuring themselves against ""credit events"" with the likes of CDS'. But to say that PRIVATE investors (which, btw., includes retirement funds and so on) were the primary reason why this was done, and ones from specific countries at that (surprise: most investors live in the countries with the largest populations), is like saying the fire department only put out a house fire to save the cat.",0,1330603484,null,0,false,0,c3wk8sr,t3_q9wq0,t1_c3wk8sr,t1_c3w8u3w,null,1428447330,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; Question: Let's say that en masse, Gypsies said ""We want to settle down and normalise - we're serious. We want to live, stay put, work and be civil.""

To me it seems amazing how little (if anything) you seem to understand about the article you just posted. And, in pertaining to the parallels to that article, your Canadian flag seems very appropriate (geography wise).

A little OT here, but I just *have* to ask this question. What do you think about the First Nations? Let's say that en masse, First Nations said ""We want to settle down and live like you guys - we're serious. We want to live, stay put, work and be civil.""

That was very interesting reading.

Note that the vast majority of words are in current use in Romanian. The ""pronunciation"" as I can make it out from the transcription seems similar to the one in Banat. Even the expressions, e.g. ""She sa fash, n-a mai avut zile"" - I have used this expression myself sometimes... (although where I'm from, we would say che and fach, ch-&gt;sh is regional... to maybe 50% of Romania). I'd say 90% of the words (and all expressions) are in current use in Romania

This would be understood anywhere in Romania:

Is having a functioning social structure, voluntarily segregated from the *gadje*, „normal” (like the case of more traditional gypsies)? Is asimilating linguistically and culturally into the *gadje* society „normal”?

Easing travel, trade and communications across Europe is nice. To coordinate Europe's police forces to tackle the spread of crime that is allowed by it, a necessity. It's only natural that businesses that operate in a multitude of countries are regulated by a body made up of those various countries. And, of course, those efforts make it possible and necessary for people to organise across the borders of Europe in non-governmental organisations as well.

But beyond that? A pan-European health care or educational system could be a bureaucratic nightmare, as each individual state and region has individual needs. The same goes for taxation and economic policy. What language would become the official language, or would officials have to be versed in or translated to five, ten or thirty different ones? It just doesn't seem very feasible sometimes.

What about foreign policy? While it might be beneficial to coordinate foreign policy with countries who are close and politically similar to our own and therefore more likely to have congruent priorities, a common foreign or defense policy strikes at the heart of each individual state's sovereignity, the defense of its borders and people and its relationship towards others. At the same time, having two foreign policies at the same time is complete folly.

What Europe will eventually end up looking like, nobody can tell. The Union is still expanding, both vertically and horizontally.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Second paragraph first, because I'll recycle a part of the answer later:

&gt; Also, if Ireland had defaulted on its bank debt, would that not simply have the donor countries to put the same money into bank recapitalisation instead of EFSF loans to Ireland? Less in fact, because we're also borrowing to close a general deficit that arose from the collapse of tax revenues/climb in social spending.

That would have been extremely dangerous, and almost certainly much more expensive. First of all, there are other countries on the brink. If we had let Ireland default, markets would have had to assume that this was how Europe now operates, that we wouldn't even *try* to prevent defaults, and that there was no reason to assume that the EU would step in and help out if any other countries get into trouble. Interest rates would have gone up, which by itself has the potential to make otherwise elevated but still manageable debt levels of some countries unsustainable. What would make it even worse is that this would have come at a time when they would have had to bail out their financial sector and economies due to the fallout from Ireland, because:  
Without a solvent Irish government to back them up, large Irish banks would have defaulted. Other banks would have to assume that yet other banks they do business with would be next, and stop lending each other money. Corporations as well as countries roll over their debt all the time, it's not like they have a credit window on their account. They take out a loan for a given time (e.g., by selling bonds), and get a new one when it comes due. But if there's no credit, because banks stop lending each other or even have defaulted themselves, they can't refinance their debt in time or at an affordable cost, and therefore can't make the payment. Now, their creditor might have relied on that payment itself, and the cycle begins anew. This means that otherwise perfectly healthy companies would default.

Yet another factor are credit default swaps. Those are basically like an insurance against a ""credit event"". That is, you can insure yourself against Ireland defaulting on its debt, so if Ireland can't pay for the bond when it matures, you get the insurance money instead. Of course this makes a lot of sense, and it's entirely legitimate. Only, you don't actually have to own Irish bonds yourself to insure yourself against a default. You may be exposed to that risk indirectly. Maybe you own a lot of stock of a bank that is heavily invested in Irish bonds, or simply fear you might lose your job if the Irish economy would tank as a result. Or, possibly, you've insured somebody else against an Irish default, and now it seems more likely than it was before, so you shell out for a couple of CDS' yourself in case you'll have to pay out yourself.   
Credit default swaps are unregulated, so nobody even knows how many are out there, but estimates are that they'd make up for the outstanding debt several times over. It's a bit as if people in your village could sell each other insurances against your house burning down. Now some will want to burn it, while others will do all they can to prevent it, and yet others that had previously sold insurances are beginning to insure themselves and hope that those they bought it from will be able to cover what they have to pay if it comes to that. And yes, that's insane, and it needs to be addressed.

&gt; Those are all fair points, but I read the emphasis on 'private investors' as referring to the issue of moral hazard. If investment in sovereigns and banks always gets paid back, it's an incentive to disregard inherent risks in those investments.

Moral hazard exists whether we're talking about private entities or public ones. That's why Merkel insists on the fiscal compact. Without it, it will be politically impossible for Germany, the Netherlands, Finland etc. to accept any solutions that might result in future bailouts or transfer payments, like Eurobonds or even a fiscal union. Why enact unpopular laws, tax increases or budget cuts if the other countries have no way to enforce debt limits and, if push comes to shove, have no choice but to bail you out?  
Of course, the fiscal compact will be no guarantee against possible bailouts becoming necessary, and Ireland is actually a good example for that, but the Greek bailout could have probably been prevented, we wouldn't have to worry about Italy (!), Spain would have to pay less interest without the looming risk in Portugal, and there would be more financial and political capital for bailouts -- I believe this thread is the first time I've ever seen the Irish bailout being questioned in any way, whereas others are, shall we say, politically more difficult.

Anyway, you're right about the ""privatize profits, socialize losses"" thing being a problem that needs to be worked on. Somehow. However, keep in mind the effect I mentioned above, about increasing interest rates letting otherwise sustainable debt levels spin out of control if markets have to assume that the Eurozone would simply ""let"" members default without even trying to step in.  
There's even more, in terms of counterproductive incentives. Take the housing bubble. It was a gravy train as long as prices went up. Now imagine you're an investment banker. How do you think are the odds, in a given year/quarter, than the trend will reverse? Five percent? Ten? Sure, the consequences would be enormous. But for you, personally, it means a giant bonus if it goes well, and you still wouldn't have to live like a peasant if, god forbid, you'd have to make do with your base salary. How does this translate to the credit default swaps I've talked about above? If you sell a lot of CDS' and insure clients against a possible but unlikely default, and those never have to pay out, you get a giant bonus. If not, well, base salary, in the worst case you lose your job. But maybe you've even insured yourself against that.",0,1330612848,null,0,false,0,c3wl47v,t3_q9wq0,t1_c3wl47v,t1_c3wkg8t,null,1428447871,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

You went to a disco and then had to put up with the boring music. And techno was considered weird and druggie by the mainstream.

Being new wave i.e. basically punk, HP Baxxter could sign in a whole lot more energetic way way as the boring disco singers. Also their techno-influenced music was also a lot more high-energy and interesteing than average disco. And yet they managed to produce something that is still mainstream enough and disco enough to be considered not weird, not subcultural, but something you can pick up average, normal chicks to.

1. We can only guess whether the markets would have distinguished between debt issued by the sovereign and debt guaranteed by the sovereign. If it didn't we'd be looking Irish assets being seized abroad (which would scare the living **shit** out of any foreign firms headquartered here) and a refusal by markets to lend to the government at a time when its balance was in deficit.

2. Even if the markets didn't link it to the sovereign, it would have triggered a credit event and an unknowable quantity of credit default swaps would have been called in. This means the total amount to be paid by all the countries affected would have been far larger than the amount Ireland has to pay now. Furthermore, our own banks would be locked out of credit markets and we'd have to cough up to the money to roll over their debt and recapitalise them anyway.

I think these factors are enough to raise doubt about whether we're some sort of sacrificial lamb.

So it does not only show a dark-skinned man portrayed in a very racist fashion, the joke is also a bad pun about his skin-color.

I am not too sure about the suicide bomber. In all german articles they talk about someone about to commit suicide (no bombs involved) and the policeman/woman yelling ""Hurry up and jump! I have other things to do today!""

Furthermore there is also one cartoon playing on the stereotype that turks in Germany do not know the language, beat each other up and like expensive cars....I did not understand that joke from the description.

I have only seen the cartoon with the black man being arrested, but this one looks awful. The fact that they manage to have three borderline to clearly racist cartoons out of twelve total speaks for itself.

Did we rise from the ashed of two World Wars to where we are today thinking like that? Why are you undervaluing hopes and dreams so much, when that has always been our inspiration?

We Europeans have achieved so much even when we were in such fierce competition and always trying to undermine each other, imagine the possibilities if we all worked together, forget about China and their slave labor, forget about America and their dollar, if we set our differences aside they'd all be put to a corner, that I have no doubt about.

Sure, for now it's just a dream, but it's a goal, something to look forward to, something achievable with a great effort and that would lay the foundations to stability and prosperity for future generations, and I honestly believe that's something we can all aspire to.

But I perfectly understand you and this I just mentioned seems to be the biggest issue, it's like we don't even want to try to make things better anymore, we continue to complain but work nothing to change it. And the sad thing is that if we just wanted we could achieve it, in fact, that's the key element. A unified Europe through tyranny is unachievable, I'm sure the Roman Empire, the 1st French Empire or the 3rd Reich would agree to that, but an Europe through diplomacy and mutual understanding, with common goals and core values, well, here we are, even if you consider only post Maastricht it's now been 18 years, and sure, things might be much better, but they could also be much worse. Look to the USA, look to China, look to India, look to Brasil, look to Russia... tell me, are any of them better than we are today? Are we really that bad or would we be better off alone versus them?

Call me an idealist, but I rather look at it as a challenge rather than just a dream, increased understanding and cooperation, that's something worth working for, right?

On the other hand, the subjects need to be addressed in their social context (family and community). Community leaders are a good medium for change (they can facilitate communication between the State and the problem-community), but the single most important aspect is family. There was a series of articles in a Romanian newspaper about Roma individuals who went from a childhood of extreme poverty to being successful and well adjusted citizens.

Are you telling me that a country that elected and re-elected Berlusconi is doing everything in their power to fight corruption? We've been asking the EU for 17 years to fix discreptancies in the budget, have they? Greece, apart from being notoriosly bad at paying taxes are number 80 on Transparency International corruption list, which didn't seem to stop them giving the most generous retirements and pensions plans of any OECD country (yes I know that they have changed it - now). And I haven't even started to on the shadow economies in some countries. 


Have any of this been dealt with? Have anything changed? No, of course not. As long as one receives money from the EU one doesn't have to. As soon as I see the they have the shadow economy of Finland, the corruption level of Denmark and the tax counsciousness of the Germans, I'm all for helping. As it is now we are actively supporting corruption and throwing good money after bad. If you want money - change. What year is southern Italy going to be as tax conscious as the Swedes? How are you decreasing the shadow economy in Spain, and when? Why should we pay money to countries that have less taxes and retire earlier (Sweden in 2nd on the highest taxes list) etc. I just want to avoid being dragged down in the corruption vortex that is the EU, and I don't think supporting corruption and throwing good money after bad benefits *anyone*, certainly not the countries that are in trouble now.

&gt;Differential social contingencies have been suggested as a possible developmental source of psychological sex differences which may result in behavioral and academic problems. The nature of teacher responses to problem and preacademic behavior of children in 15 preschool classes as a function of the sex of the child was examined. Frequencies of dependent and disruptive child behaviors and a variety of teacher behaviors were recorded. Teachers were more likely to respond when boys were aggressive than when girls were. They also used more loud reprimands when scolding boys. In response to dependent behaviors, teachers gave girls increased attention when they were physically proximal, which they did not do for boys. Teachers also used more directions and instructions when responding to solicitation by boys. Finally, boys were more likely to receive several types of nurturant and instructional attention while participating appropriately in class activities.",0,1330627117,null,0,false,0,c3wnnlz,t3_qcpn8,t1_c3wnnlz,t1_c3wmya6,null,1435735486,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Although I don't know what the proportions of staff makeup were in 1973, the phrase ""the early childhood workforce seems stuck in the 1970s family model"" in [this article](http://fatherandchild.org.nz/magazine/issue-36/critically-endangered-male-pre-school-teachers/).

If single mothers (or any mothers) are inadequate, then so am I.  I've already mentioned that I'm primary carer for a 6 year old girl, and I have been since she was six months old.  In normal circumstances my wife gets maybe an hour a day with her.  At present, she's only home at weekends, so it's even worse.  It's not even a question of adequacy to me, it's simply something different.  As it happens, here at least educational achievement is rising for *both* sexes, so there's something being done right.  Female levels of educational achievement have risen faster than male though.  It still strikes me as unjust that this trend doesn't carry through into the workplace.  Male favouring personal, societal and institutional sexism, although the primary reasons, aren't the whole story.  Again, I'd need to pull out the studies to give you full citation but there is no agreement on whether the other reasons are innate characteristics or socialised ones.

I would do the country-specific thing but since I don't think any of you want to listen to [chalga](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra6_xvFv79c), I'll just try and haphazardly splay some of my favorite kinds of Euro music in general. I'll stay away from metal because I spend enough time on r/metal and it consumes a lot of my time anyway.

**FOLK[-ish!]**

I am a huge fan of folk music, though I haven't had as much of a chance to explore it as I would have liked. A few of my favorites, though:

*A [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LocyLDGUBjg) my Norwegian friend introduced to me.

*One of my [favorites](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_e7r0ABEHA) by Kebnekajse - a Swedish folk-rock band. 

*More Swedish: a traditional Swedish folk [tune](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo8YXsIU5f8)

*[Eläkeläiset](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngk5Ke6JdA&amp;feature=related), a silly 'humppa' band from Finland.

*A song that caught my ear: Ukrainian [wedding polka](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfejQdSPLkI)

*Hilarious irony from [Romania](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt4CYaKcoxo)

*Beautiful acountic from Portugal: [João Gilberto](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qMV3c56vnw)

*Extremely Bulgarian folk. You're not even prepared for this level of [folk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rVQv8GOKi8)

*A very funky [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAmLyntIas0) from a Turkish band that won't get out of your head all day. Yes, it's Turkish. Don't be pedantic.

**OTHERS**

The Complaints Choir series:

[Hamburg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=569qbNdm75c)  
[Budapest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGgkHyti0ME)

*A personal favorite of mine: [Drøm Videre, Violeta](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUeBFOE7gnY) by Kaizers Orchestra

*Brilliant from Iceland: [Sólstafir](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOTan9FDRWw)

*Random prog rock from Hungary: [Townscream](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUfNkU7rFTA) I have no idea where I found this but it's so beautiful.

*A German band called City. They were famous during the 70's, so some people from here may know of them. [Am Fenster](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZg13WRDhgM) and [Bulgarien-Rock](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOtkJhvzu1s)

And finally! I won't miss a chance to post one of my absolute favorite bands: Estradasphere - [A Corporate Merger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c0AFEWjczY). They're American but with obvious folk influences.

In the same vein, [Beltaine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o34nzkSQP0); not European but drawing from the same folk as Estradasphere.

This implies we should have honoured the guaranteed debt, which would have required a bailout anyway. Also, the money paid was owed by State owned institutions, so the problem is still the same.

&gt;2) What difference doesd it make who triggers it, the whole EU banking system is fucked and the Euro is a joke, wake up.

Is your point here that it would have made no difference whether or not a default on Irish bank debt happened? Why do you think that?

&gt; 3) Just because something is in your interest doesnt mean you stop it at all costs, there is a line.

Our banks have to roll over debt all the time. Only ten per cent of the money you place in the bank is kept there. In order to meet all the withdrawals, the banks need long term funding. Every time you hear about a bond being paid off, the bank is actually borrowing a new bond to maintain its liquidity. If it can't borrow any more money, then you've lost 90 cents of every euro you have on deposit. What is an appropriate cost to prevent that happening?

&gt;The EU only needs to do one thing, the same thing the yanks did and the English devalue the fucking currency already. They could have stopped this before it ever really got started.

The studying situation and the amount of pretty girls depends on your subject though :D In subjects like arts or languages there will be many girls, but the lecture hall is sometimes so full that people have to sit on the floor.

In engineering or science theres always enough space to sit and stuff, but you'll find only very few girls there.

Also germans (and people from Paderborn especially) are very shy so it'll help if you are open and talk to them rather than waiting for them to start talking to you.

There are some interesting things in Paderborn to visit/do depending on your interests, e.g. Paderborn has the worl's biggest computer museum. If you let me know your field of interest i can tell you a few places that you should visit.

If things are changing - So why are Greece sinking on Transparency International ? Why have their shadow economy grown, as has Spains? How many more years until southern Italy start paying taxes? Why haven't the EU managed to fix the discreptancies for the last 17 (!!!!) years. I'd much rather IKEA sell less in southern Europe (they don't sink or swim with that, nor does Sweden) than we keep handing over money so that these countries do not have to change. If you are changing - prove it. Show me the statistic that southern Italy is as diligent as the Finns with their taxes, the shadow economies are sinking etc. You can't do that because that is not happening at the moment.

&gt;That's what EU is all about: instead of gaining from others' losses, gaining from everybody's growth.


You can't grow if it's build on sand. Like the Greek economy has been growing? I'd rather have bad years and solid, true growth, than facilitating corruption and aiding countries in avoiding necessary changes.

true,saldejums,ANAR,"Free Peopledom of Earth [EN;LV;RU;DE,RO;PL]","Absolutely not. There are numerous things I consider to be wrong.

1. the Design. Decentralised power is the best way to go. It prevents corruption and political theft in massive scale and in case of war, even if nukes were used, it would have been harder to terminate many command posts rather than one. everything decentralizes during critical times.

2. Corporate interests. Look at US. I have frequented [/r/conspiracy](/r/conspiracy), which often is true. I will never go to war or serve for somebodies else greedy interests. I don't want my politicians to be bought. Yes, everyone has resistance to bribes, but to buy a nation, that is something only corporations do. We have to get rid of possibilities for Europe to be bought.

3. I don't want to deal with crap just like we had to just after becoming part of EU. Yes, I like regulations and standards for food, but asking a country to close down only factory it has left and dropping into deep crisis is not wise choice. The Brand ""Jelgavas cukurs"" then was bought by Dansukker. Our local farmers hurt. Their lives depended on that.The reason to shut down the factory:""Overproduction of sugar in EU, so close it down or pay huge fines."" Don't fuck with last straw of already robbed, corrupt and old country.

4. Traditions. I really enjoy traveling, meeting people, visiting awesome places. I don't want visit place just for its architecture. It would have been awful to tour Germany with Greek guide talking about Jewish holocaust. Europe is great thing to raise global standards of wellbeing and security of Europe, but it should not replace our own local governments.

5. Control of Government. In here we elect people who runs our country and elect people who sits in chairs in Brussels. If we dislike something - massage our politicians. It would be a lot harder to make pressure on somebody sitting in Brussels.

6. As thesarajevorose said - we are Serbians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Swedes, Britons and everybody else there can be and we all have our different belonging and culture. Germans and Balts are very different. We like to take our time - be late for half a hour or open restaurant for somebody in holiday for spare hour earlier if somebody is waiting outside and you can't expect us standing outside the door until everyone has the exact time passed on their watches and rush into the building. For Britons it is common to be drunk, acquire ""super powers"" and go ""hunting ladies"" or abusing local monuments that were earned very hard with lives of our forefathers. We cannot tolerate such a disrespect. Ethnic tensions will rise (lookup Germany before WW2 and neo-nazi Russia 21st century).

I really like how Eu is going now and it had hit our local pride very hard some times, but it just works and I do not want it to be any different.

The current government is what media calls ""technical"" (not so) and its aim at the moment is restoring faith in Italy's ability to recover from the crisis. We are paying alot for this and I hope it will work out (hint: in politics and economy hope is often a self fulfulling prophecy).

You are right when saying that we have high level of corruption (which increased after WW2), but our current problem is not corruption per se but rather the internalization of mafia like business pratice in politics. It's not that the mafias are corruptiong the politicians: mafia is *becoming* the politicians. This is somehow worse but also raises the awareness of the population. The reaction is slow, but I assure you the recent crisis woke up a considerable part of the population.

We have high level of taxation. 42.6% of GDP vs Sweden's 47.9 (2009 data, now we have higher VAT). That is *collected* taxes, which excludes shadow economy. High taxes is only one part of the equation. the relevant part is how you spend the collected tax money. Italy historically spent it quite unwisely.

You assume EU paid for southern Italy, but that's not really true: while inner italian funding of the south is generally unchecked (and thus abused), access to EU funds requires accountability. It's quite common to hear from local southern Italy politicians ""we haven't been able to use EU funds that were reserved for us"".

Last but not least, Italy was, as 2009, a net contributor to the EU, which means we paid for being an EU member , and actually MORE than Sweden (100eu per capita vs 44), while each of the rich Luxembourg's citizens got 2364.5 from EU. ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_the_European_Union#Net_contributors_and_recipients)). an excerpt:

&gt;The four largest net contributors in absolute terms are:. Germany, France, Italy, UK  
&gt;The four largest net contributors in per capita terms are: Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy

true,Norrsken,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;So what you're saying is you want the poorer countries to fix their problems but you won't tie your fate to them until it won't have any inconvenience on you


You must truly have a really strange view of the world if you consider Italy for example, a G7 country, poor. No,  i do not want to hand over money to G7 countries, and I do not feel bad about that. Norway is richer than Finland, they are not assholes for not helping them.Have you ever been to a truly poor country? Spain, Italy etc do not qualify as such. Call them less super rich instead. 


Besides, in your argumentation you did not answer how to get rid of the corruption (who help bring the countries to where they are)- we should just hand over money, no questions asked. You conveniently ignore we have been doing that for about 20 years, without any changes in corruption whatsoever, in fact, the shadow economies are growing and some countries are falling on the Transparency International List. Apparently that does not matter to you, as soon as we try to influence other countries, by withholding finances we are mean. In your argumentation we can't win, can we? We are cheap as soon as we don't give them money (I refuse to use the world help, since I believe that we are aiding a corrupt system), no matter what they do with it. I'd like to see records from Greece for the last 20 years, Italy too. Why don't they have to do the same thing we do? Why do they retire earlier? Why don't they have to pay same amount of taxes (or, lets be honest, in some cases, just why don't they pay taxes). No, in your version, it's hand over the money, no change whatsoever..


If they prove that they are changing in a positive direction (which they are not at the moment), have a higher retirement age, show us what they have been doing with the money they have received for the last 10-15 years, start paying taxes etc, then we can discuss things, but as it is now we are aiding a corrupt system.

true,Norrsken,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;I don't think you're up-to-date with Italian politics: last time Berlusconi was elected was 4 years ago: he's not the current PM and his party is acting less dependently on him 


Four years is short, since I was drawing a time linesince the 2nd world war. I also do not believe that you change the mind of a people in four years. Also, Berlusconi was *forced* to step down by the EU, not by the Italian people. If you want change, why have you elected him? Again and again. 


&gt;You are right when saying that we have high level of corruption (which increased after WW2), but our current problem is not corruption per se but rather the internalization of mafia like business pratice in politics. It's not that the mafias are corruptiong the politicians: mafia is becoming the politicians. This is somehow worse but also raises the awareness of the population. The reaction is slow, but I assure you the recent crisis woke up a considerable part of the population.


Good -then we will see considerably changes soon I assume and then we can talk. I just read that the corruption charges against Berlusconi was dropped, and I have a hard time believing you but sometimes it would be lovely to be wrong.


&gt;We have high level of taxation. 42.6% of GDP vs Sweden's 47.9 (2009 data, now we have higher VAT). That is collected taxes, which excludes shadow economy. High taxes is only one part of the equation. the relevant part is how you spend the collected tax money. Italy historically spent it quite unwisely.

Yes, we are taxed more, and we retire later. I just don't see why we should pay to anyone as long as we are on a higher level, or retire later. Also, if you spend it unwisely, then start spending it wisely then.  Also, you do not collect your taxes as much as we do. From what I've understood it's well know that you have an ineffective and corrupt bureacracy, but no one seem to have wanted to change that - ever.  The fact that southern Italy don't pay taxes is well known even here, and exactly how are you going to make that change this time? *And* - how are you going to tear down the shadow economy! If you start taxing them, you definately do not need any aid, you'll be super rich. So why isn't and hasn't this happened before, Italy has been in crises before. You must forgive me, I do not believe the changes you are referring to, until I see it, particularely with the growing shadow economies.


&gt;Last but not least, Italy was, as 2009, a net contributor to the EU, which means we paid for being an EU member MORE than Sweden (100eu per capita vs 44)

That is true, and somewhat redeeming,  but unfortunately the billions of Euros just being spent to aid the failing Eurocountries (which my government stupidly enough has decided to aid, their most recent giveaway was 100 billion which to me is throwing good money after bad) and it dwarfs any of that. The EU budgets are fairly small actually, but the billions being pumped into helping failing economies are not. Your reforms are long overdue, but you have not done them, which is *one* of the reasons you are in a crises.  


&gt;You assume EU paid for southern Italy, but that's not really true: while inner italian funding of the south is generally unchecked (and thus abused), access to EU funds requires accountability. It's quite common to hear from local southern Italy politicians ""we haven't been able to use EU funds that were reserved for us"".

I have heard differently. When EU actually checks where the money (agriculture mostly I believe)actually has gone, southern Italy is a top swindler, together with Corsica, Greece etc. It's possible that the swindle less than from your internal funds, but they do definately swindle more than the average northern Europan. That pisses me off, I do not think they should receive any money, at all. Better to stop payments altogether then. Why do you allow them to swindle within the country?


All in all one can conclude at least that the differences are so wast, that there is no risk of our two countries being united in a federal EU anytime soon. I don't know how the Italians feel, but my guess is that the Swedes would hate it (not Italy in particular, we just do not want to give up our independence). I mean, even joining the Euro get a big ""NO"", from about 90 % of the population. Part of it is what I have outlined in my arguments, but I guess parts of it just comes down to ""cultural differencies"", whatever that is.

I'm describing the feeling in Italy right now and you're counter-argumenting with past events and partial information (for example, Berlusconi's charges weren't dropped, they expired (and this is another problem, but not what you're hinting at)).

Plus, I feel like you're asking rhethorical questions, since you already spew out the answers. Why do we allow people to suck up money wastefully?

Perhaps that's something lacking in current European ""social engineering"", as you put it. In a civilised Europe, there's really little need for the stick. We hear about prison islands with no cells, etc. It's a civilised society. If you put a Somali warlord or a Hong Kong Triad hitman in one of those prisons, they would destroy it and everything. That's what maximum security prison is for: the stick.

Of all of the many things I have seen and the personal accounts I have been told or read, I see plenty of people willing to help, but no one putting a limit on it. And there seems to be this inescapable (for non-Roma) escape clause of ""it's our culture, you have to let us do it""...for whatever reason, the law applies to *you*, but it doesn't apply to *them*, thus, they use your own laws against you.

""You have to follow your laws about us, but we don't have to follow your laws. Only you do.""

true,Norrsken,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;you're mixing things up. the ECB lendings are in Euro, so Sweden is not paying any of that, for example. 

Yes we are. As I said, technically we are giving the money to the IMF rescue fund for the Euro countries (or down the drain as I call it), but that resuce fund is counted on when the Eurozone decides how much money to give in their bailouts.IMF contributes to them. It is earmarked for Eurocountries, and I do not believe they mean Finland and Austria :-). We have also given money straight to other countries, for example Ireland, Latvia (not the Eurofailure) etc.

&gt;About saving bad banks, also I should point out that many countries threw billions of public money into failing banks, but Italy didn't.

I have never mentioned banks, and I know that. Besides, I think if banks are bad, they should fail just like other companies.I don't want to save German and French banks. Sweden threw billions into banks too, in the 90's, but that was actually a text book case of a good save, so it *can* be done reasonably, I just don't think the Eurozone are acting that way. 

&gt;I'm describing the feeling in Italy right now and you're counter-argumenting with past events and partial information (for example, Berlusconi's charges weren't dropped, they expired (and this is another problem, but not what you're hinting at)).


I am not arguing against what you are *feeling* but that is just it. You are *feeling* it, but I haven't seen any real changes yet. If you don't think my arguments are valid, you must also understand that arguments that are based on your feelings aren't exactly solid facts either. 

The reason I bring up past events is that the past brought you to where you are today and I think it's a tad naive to believe that everything will change now- one just can't ignore the past and the deep seated corruption. To convince me perhaps you can tell me how you are going to change - what are the plans then.  How are they laid out? What year is southern Italy going to be on par with norhtern Italy? Are you going to bring all tax evaders to justice and exactly how are you going to reform the bureacracy? For a rational northerner like me, seeing those plans, people brought to justice etc, that would give much more impact than what you are feeling, however heartfelt and honest.



&gt;I'm trying to understand what your point is. Not wanting to increase unity with countries like Italy. That I understand, it's a completely legit opinion, but it's not like I'm trying to force it on you. I'm simply pointing out that many of the arguments you're using to support that opinion are based on wrong information and assumptions. There are many arguments to support your opinion and some of them are summarizable with ""I don't want to support lazy people/countries"", but you're using bad facts :)


I have never said lazy, you said that. I said you should retire the same age and pay as much taxes as we do, which I do not think is unreasonable, do you? I do admit to hating corruption and not wanting to aid that though, and it irks me that we support countries where it's basically integrated into the economy/society.


The point is (apart from the fact that you started to message me, and I *was*, in the beginning, describing several reasons why I wouldn't want to be in a federal union with several  of the EU countries) that  I believe you are too optimistic and I do not believe Italy is changing (not that being optimistic is a fault, it's an admirable trait). I am pointing out negative and historical things, as to prove my point and to why we shouldn't contribute any money until we actually see things changing for the better. That is for example why I bring up the shadow economy, the tax evasion and corruption. As long as they are increasing or staying the same, I don't see why we should aid.


I understand that you are not trying to force unity on me either, but I have to admit that I almost laugh a little when I see the wild arguments and counterarguments going on in this thread and think to myself ""Someone wants to unite this- Good luck"" 


If I am wrong - wonderful, that is one of the cases I would be happy to be. It would be great for Italy, Europe and the world if you could turn those things around, for real. I am just more pessimistic, but perhaps ten years from now you can prove me wrong. 

And, some of the reasons I do not want to join in a federation are as I've said before, but I think I, as a lot of Swedes am a Swede first and a European second. If we were to join anything, it would be with our Nordic neighbours, and they seem to be feeling the same. Perhaps it's the same down south, Spanish people prefer Portugal to Poland, quite understandably.What do Italians think, and why?

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"What the ECB payed, on average, is estimated to be only about 70%, and they're not part of the deal about privately held debt. The ECB doesn't aim for profits, although it regularly makes some as a side effect of its function, e.g., on the interest it takes in on funding it provides to the banks to increase the money supply. Those profits are then payed out to the share holders proportionally, i.e., the member states' central banks. From there, it goes more or less straight to the national budgets (""more or less"" because it depends on national legislation; in Germany, for example, the first €3.5bn go to the budget, everything above that used to be used to pay off Reunification cost, and now will go into paying off bailout debt). Not incidentally, the share the member states' central banks have of the ECB is the same as their share of the bailout.

The reason they don't take part in the reduction is simply that they can get away with it. So they chose to keep their options open, to have more leverage to ""incentivize"" Greek government action, i.e., to be able to use that money as either a carrot or a stick, or to be able to swap them for other countries' bonds of equal nominal value.

Now, *why* it would be clever to be able to swap them for other bonds at nominal value, which essentially would be the answer to your question, is something I've read but unfortunately forgot about, so this reply doesn't actually help.

true,Kim147,UKGB,United Kingdom Thanks,"The Op has touched below on cross boarder issues of taxation and the application of that taxation re. health etc. . If I can give a couple of examples of 'inventiveness' :-

There are a lot of workers who spend large amounts of time outside of their own home countries . Contractors are a classic example . If they work more than 183 days in most Continental countries they have to be no longer working via their own ltd. co.'s - ie as a small business person - but by a local umbrella company . Their costs - specifically their taxes and charges more than double - and likewise their rate is greater . In our current economic conditions they get screwed from all sides . So much so that many UK contractors will not work Continental contracts . And because of this great labour market inflexibility the economies of many of the Euro zone countries are suffering . This is a classic example of a top down solution that has not been well thought out .

When a contractor finishes a contract he \ she goes back to their home country - it's from there that they derive their benefits - not some other country where they have only been working a short to medium time . 

It would have been far better for people to nominate their own home countries to whom they pay their taxes , from who they derive their benefits , including retirement benefits . 

Another area is currencies . We operate on a fiat currency basis . The Euro is a currency union but not a full financial union . The individual countries need to have full control over their economies - hence full responsibility over their economies . This means having their own individual currencies and having these floated and freely traded . How to trade internationally with a single currency ? - simple - have the Euro as well and trade against it .

Money is a representation of hours worked - that is it's value . If a person in Germany generates say DM100 that should be exchangeable with any other European currency - eg. FF300 - without any margin being charged - ie. as if it is a Euro currency . Further when the exchange takes place the currency should be negatively QE'd out of the German system and positively QE'd into the French system . After all all it is is a representation of value - it doesn't matter what denomination it is in . Trade out of the Euro zone could be conducted using the Euro - convert from local currency to Euro , then at the destination country from Euro to local currency . The tricky bit would be establishing and maintaining an exchange rate for the Euro .

I am not in favor of a ""federal EU"".  I'd like to see a confederation, if anything - a partnership of equals.

The things that the EU could deliver, which would be best for everyone, are

- free trade
- free movement of people
- common coordinated defense policy
- cooperation on certain administrative topics (e.g. movement of pensions, international payments)
- certain types of standardization (technical, environmental, etc.)

The point being (a) to make everyone richer, either by encouraging trade or cutting costs and inefficiency, and (b) to ensure peace.

This does not require a government.

I am a huge defender of direct democracy.  I am staunchly of the opinion that the United States is too big to effectively be governed in its current state.  Even a nominally democratic set of institutions, like the European Parliament, in the end reduces the motivation by citizens to participate democratically, because (a) the very size of Europe will naturally give rise to bureaucracy out of proportion to its effectiveness (what the US is suffering increasingly under) and (b) the individual vote counts so much less, including for laws which are universally applicable but which may not be as appropriate for Poland as they are for Italy or Scotland.",0,1330694613,null,0,false,0,c3wxgse,t3_qcrj6,t1_c3wxgse,t1_c3wjy5f,null,1428453861,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;Als nationale Minderheit wird eine Minderheit bezeichnet, die unter die Bestimmungen des Rahmenübereinkommens zum Schutz nationaler Minderheiten des Europarates fällt.

Und Beispiele:
&gt;Hierbei ist es unerheblich, ob diese Gruppe ethnisch dem Staatsvolk eines anderen Staates angehört (beispielsweise Dänen in Deutschland, Ungarn in Rumänien, Italiener in Slowenien, deutsche Minderheiten in Osteuropa wie die Donauschwaben), ob sie in mehreren Staaten als Minderheiten lebt (beispielsweise Friesen in Deutschland und den Niederlanden, Roma in weiten Teilen Europas) oder als geschlossene ethnische Gruppe in nur einem Land beheimatet ist (beispielsweise Sorben in Deutschland, Kaschuben in Polen).

Friesen sind eine nationale Gruppe. Wenn beispielsweise die Friesen gegen das ""CDU Regime"" wären und z.B. paramilitärische Christsoziale die Friesen dafür ausrotten, dann ist das nach dem Europarat ein Genozid.

seit jahren versucht er immer und immer wieder mit ein und der selben widerlegten these in die medien zu kommen...um seinen tollen bart zu zeigen. 

Im letzten Jahr gabs in den Sommermonaten ein inhaltliches Loch in den Medien, dessen sich Hans Holterdiepolter Sinn bemächtigen wollte in dem er wiedermal steile Thesen bzgl. tickenden Zeitbombem im Finanzsystem, untragbare Griechen usw. raushaut.

Das macht Hans jetzt seit Jahren. Und jedes mal dauert es dann ein paar Wochen, bis die Medien Hans ihm seinen Bart nicht mehr so toll finden und auch mal recherchieren. 

Hätten man bei Deutsche Welle schon Internet, hätte man ganz schnell gemerkt dass mindestens 2x pro Jahr Hansis lustige BWLAusfälle durch die Medien geistern und dann für totalen Quatsch befunden werden.

hier ein Beispiel: 

* http://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=10025

Das erkennt sogar die konservative wirtschaftsfreundliche Presse meist nach ein paar Tagen.
Zitat Welt.de:
&gt;... Hans-Werner Sinn, der fleischgewordene Beleg des Klischees, dass die Ökonomie zu einer als Wissenschaft getarnten Ideologie geworden ist,...

Quelle: 

* http://www.welt.de/fernsehen/article13180050/Atompanik-und-Windrad-Laerm-bei-Maybrit-Illner.html

Hans Werner vertritt auch die Meinung Atomkraft wäre super und Atomkraftwerke bombensicher. 

**tl;dr**: Hans Werner Sinn erzählt viel, wenn der Tag lang ist.

And how a lot of anti Gypsi racism evolved around that. And then he mentioned certain episodes where Gyspies were forced to settle somewhere. 

But essentially it is about a history of racism. And the first comment you mention to blurt out is a very racist comment on different levels. 

First of all, you assume that by adopting Western livestyle and settleing down, they would assimilate and that is what they would want. Second you assume ""a large proportion"" and ""trust"". Gypsies are individuals just like everyone else. You trust an individual. Or not. And an individual settles down. Or assimilates into another culture. This kind of thing comes from a racist mindset. Just like the ""large proportion"" of Muslims that support terrorism, or the ""large proportion"" of Indians that are lazy. Or whatever.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Will do if I remember where I read it. But it wasn't that convincing of an option, anyway, the main reason is still just because they can.  
The downside, btw., is that giving the ECB this special status means that more of the losses have to be spread among fewer bonds that are still held by the private sector. So, the risk is that they will assume the same thing would happen again in a similar situation, which means there is more risk, which in turn leads to higher interest rates for threatened countries. The head of the Bundesbank even openly criticized this move for this reason. However, so far nothing along those lines has actually happened, and it looks as if there will be no negative consequences.  
Good for us tax payers. Of course you could say this comes at the cost of Greeks, but there is no chance in hell that this would have been passed on, they would have cut the privately held debt less instead. 

Now that I think about it... The goal was a (theoretical) 120% debt to GDP level by 2020. To make even this highly optimistic scenario work, the total amount had to be reduced -- and now it looks as if the private sector took the whole hit, more than €100bn worth of losses, without any negative consequences (higher interest rates, triggering credit default swaps, or needing bank bailouts).  
Of course this makes preciously little difference for ordinary Greeks, but for the rest of us, this is good. It's not only about the money; I'm convinced that eventually Greece's publicly held debt will have to be cut as well. But it means that there is less outstanding Greek government debt still held by banks, so there's less uncertainty about potential losses or credit default swaps, i.e., even if Greece would eventually have to default or would choose to exit the Eurozone, the negative effects on Europe's financial sector are a bit less of a doomsday scenario.

That entity consists of representatives of the sector, so it's the same people who write those CDS' to each other. But yeah, there was too much at risk. Too big to fail. :)

&gt; Maybe the lesson for the banking industry is that CDSs (like many other amazing financial instruments) are bullshit and won't protect them, so they need to start paying attention to whom and how they loan their money like in the good old days.

I very much hope that the lesson will be something like that. This stuff needs to be regulated somehow. The problem with abolishing them entirely is that they *can* serve an entirely legitimate purpose.

Serbian authorities had, according to them, been searching and searching, but just couldn’t find Mlatic and Hadzic . In the end they were left with no other choice than to cooperate. Let’s look at the timeline. 

[19 May 2011 ](http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/serbia-enlarge.a2d) 

Jose Manuel Barroso warned Serbia that time is running out and only full cooperation with a war crimes court will secure it EU candidacy status this year.

“During a visit to Serbia last week the ICTY's prosecutor Serge Brammertz warned that Serbia ""can do more and must do more"" to arrest the fugitives, saying ""there can be no alternative"" to their arrest.”  

""The two remaining fugitives (Mladic and Hadzic ) are escaping justice, this is not an acceptable end. . .Barroso said.  
    
""We need results before summer ... and cooperation with ICTY  is of critical importance,"" he (Barroso) added.  
  

A June (2011) report was to  be the last before the European Commission gave its opinion on Serbia's candidacy bid on October 12.

true,gocarsno,POLA,Poland,"Wow, Reddit *is not* going to like this. I understand this gut reaction but let's take a breath and think about it.

I am of the opinion that almost every kind of services and products are better and more efficiently provided by private businesses. Government's job is to govern, not to run services, and privatization is the *default* situation. Government should only get involved in the rare cases when there is a strong, fundamental reason why a private provision of a service cannot work.

Now, it might seem that law enforcement is on of the exceptions. I have many reservations myself. Then again, while it is a particularly sensitive area, is it really that different in this regard from some other services we already trust private businesses with, e.g. health care? It is hard to imagine a more difficult and delicate service than medical care, yet it seems normal there are private hospitals and clinics and people don't have a problem literally entrusting their lives to them. And since when do we trust the government so much and private enterprises so little, anyway?

Living in Poland, when I go the doctor I don't even notice if the establishment is private or publicly-run; all I care about is that I'm covered by NFZ (the Polish equivalent of NHS in the UK). Actually, that's not completely true, I do notice - the private ones are usually much better.

That's an excellent question, and one I can't answer. We can certainly say not getting murdered is a right, and being able to freely punch someone in the face isn't a right (at least, in regards to legislation). Different countries draw the lines differently. In America, though, if the Supreme Court determines something is a right, it's a right.

*If* we acknowledge something is a right, it's not up for a vote. In the UK, *if* the British acknowledge freedom of religion is a right, then no referendum may ever come up about whether or not someone can be a Muslim.

The Constitution, for instance, says freedom of speech is a right. This means that even if 90% of Americans thing Holocaust denial should be illegal, it can't ever be. The Supreme Court determined abortion fell under right to privacy, which is constitutional. This means that it doesn't matter how religious a state you are; it's a right. Not up for a referendum.

Then what is? If you have no educational system - education is provided by the members of the village/most experienced or what not. However that can easily be corrupted and influenced by the factions controlling the region. What you end up having are either children with no education or kids taught old myths and stories by men who do not know any better, or the worst - they are fed propaganda and lies by the fighting factions.

This is why education is so important - without it you cannot judge your life and cannot judge the possible gains something can bring since you have no reference level. Everything is relative. We can compare our lifestyle and our culture and judge it relative to theirs. They cannot do that since they do not know our history/culture/lifestyle due to bad education.

No it's not, sorry.. and I just spend 30 minutes learning why. Thank you for that :)

I just learnt that in is a Wechselproposition, it sometimes demands a Akkusativ, some times a Dativ, it depends on the apropriate Question. Nice examples given [here](http://www.mein-deutschbuch.de/lernen.php?menu_id=84)

If you can ask Wo its Dativ (der Wohnung), if you can ask Wohin its Akkusativ (die Wohnung). Wohin demands some kind of movement to be allowed.

Wo ist der Schlüssel? In der Wohnung in (der Stadt) Portland  
Wohin gehst du? In die Wohnung  in (der Stadt) Portland

Yes

&gt; Also, Direct Object before Indirect Object.

see below, there is now indirect object in this sentence

&gt; The way I read it Wohnung answers ""What"" and Portland answers ""Who"" (so to speak). 

No. 

Who is doing something? ER wohnt in einer Wohnung in der Hauptstadt  
What is he doing? Er WOHNT in einer Wohnung in der Hauptstadt  
Wo wohnt er? Er wohnt IN EINER WOHNUNG in der Hauptstadt  
Wo ist diese Wohnung? Er wohnt in einer Wohnung IN DER HAUPTSTADT  

There is no indirekt Objekt in these sentence but two [Präpositionsobjekte](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objekt_%28Grammatik%29#Pr.C3.A4positionalobjekt) which both belong to the verb wohnen.

Er liegt auf einer Decke in der Wiese  
Er liegt in der Wiese  auf einer Decke  

The same is possible (and happening) in English:

(1) They robbed him (direktes Objekt) of his ring (präpositionales Objekt). [WP](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objekt_%28Grammatik%29#Objekte_im_Englischen)

&gt; I was taught Akkusative answers ""What?"" and Dative answers ""Who?"" 

Jein. 

[Akkusativ](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkusativ)
&gt;Er wird auch als sogenannter Wenfall bezeichnet, da man nach dem Akkusativ mit „Wen …?“ (oder „Was …?“) fragt. Er wird in der deutschen Grammatik als der 4. Fall bezeichnet.

[Dativ](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dativ)  
&gt; Er kann darüber hinaus weitere Funktionen haben. Der Dativ heißt in der deutschen Grammatik auch 3. Fall oder Wemfall. Sein Name rührt daher, dass er den Empfänger des Gegebenen darstellt.

In thi case on of the dativs ""other functions"" is used, after a präposition (in) 

&gt; Bei einigen Präpositionen des Ortes können sowohl Dativ als auch Akkusativ stehen. Der Dativ gibt den aktuellen Ort an, während der Akkusativ die Richtung auf ein Ziel bezeichnet. So verhält es sich mit in (Beispiel: „wir schlafen in dem Bett“, „wir gehen in das Bett“). Die Präpositionen, bei denen entweder Dativ oder Akkusativ stehen kann, sind: in, an, auf, vor, hinter, über, unter, neben, zwischen.

With another Präposition another cause would be possible.

Where in Bavaria exactly? If around München I suggest asking again on ToyTownGermany. Lots of people living in and around that area and it is a good site for general German questions.  Congrats and good luck!

Non è che si fa un buco in una montagna così... tanto per. Se l'Italia vuole accedere al corridoio 5 Lisbona-Kiev c'è da fare questa cosa, e non credo affatto che sia una cosa tanto inutile quanto dicono: il mercato è in calo, la crisi, ecc... ma questa è roba che sarà finita tra 20 anni, ed è sul mercato futuro che si deve pesare l'investimento. È un'opera strategica. Io non voglio rompere le palle alla popolazione locale, ma è proprio in nome di questa logica che in Italia (come dice Fabbrizio Fibbrizi) non si investe in nulla di importante dagli anni 70. Francesi e tedeschi non vedono l'ora di tirare dritto dietro le alpi (e infatti questo è il loro piano B se da questa parte si molla tutto, paganto comunque un botto di penali).
Alla domanda ""Perché in francia non fanno tutto sto casino?"" c'è chi risponde che in Francia se ti espropriano un terreno non ti ripagano con un soldo bucato. Bene, che facciano una trattativa su questo piuttosto che bloccare tutto a prescindere.
