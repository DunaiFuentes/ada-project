Citation needed.

I do know that the Socialist Party has improved in the polls but then again Sócrates isn't there any longer and we're still far away from the next elections. I wouldn't really see this as opposition as, as much as they now try to play it, it was them that were in power from 2005 to 2011 and it was them that asked for the foreign help and negotiated the budget cuts with the troika.

With regards to the Communists, they're always the same with about ~8% and with regards to the Left Bloc, they fell the hardest in the previous elections from ~10% to ~5%. So yeah, where's the radical left gaining ground?

I'm reminded of the liberum veto in Poland as to why maintaining it is a terribly shit idea. Narrow self interest prevails and foreign actors can paralyse the entire decision making process by convincing one state to wield its veto.

The vigorous opposition to a transfer union is borne out of the fact that the paying countries would like to both have their cake and eat it too. All the advantages with none of the disadvantages. As we've already seen, that hasn't really worked out too well. Institutional history of the EU suggests they're all very fond of putting off the necessary actions until the last possible minute, in case of a currency block, it's taking them 12 years and counting to get on with mutualisation of debt since monetary union (a lot longer if you start counting from 1970 when they cooked up the Werner plan). And you're right in that they'll fight until the last possible second, but it will happen.

&gt; One distinct feature of these surveys is that respondents were asked to report how much they trust their fellow citizens and how much they trust the citizens of each of the countries in the European Union. **More specifically, they were asked the following: “I would like to ask you a question about how much trust you have in people from various countries. For each, please tell me whether you have a lot of trust, some trust, not very much trust or no trust at all.”**

So the most trusted countries in Europe are: Denmark (3.05), Sweden (3.01) and the Netherlands (3), and the least trusted Italy (2.53, ouch), Greece (2.59) and Portugal (2.66). Somewhere in the middle are Germany (2.84), France (2.79) and the UK (2.85).

Also interesting is that the countries that tend to be most trusted are also the most trusting, and the reverse for the countries that are least trusted.

You can also pick out animosities between particular countries, or even animosities which are one-sided. For instance, relatively speaking, the Spanish don't trust the French (2.37), but the French trust the Spanish (2.68). Or the Portuguese don't trust the Austrians (2.13), but the Austrians are ambivalent about the Portuguese (2.5).

Count me in, I wholly disagree with some its measures, namely the serious increases in taxes which while they'll reduce the short term public deficits, on the long run it will make the economy much more uncompetitive. All this while we're struggling to reduce emigration and unemployment remains dangerously high - you're right, we're performing very poorly in these aspects.

&gt;Saying the public supports this course is clearly wrong.

The public also doesn't support the alternatives presented of ending austerity and going back to spending. We've had spending for decades and the economy didn't grow, we must not confuse cause and consequence, we must have economic growth to afford public spending, not spend to create economic growth.

IMO, because the alternatives of what is being done are also so shitty, that's why there's such an unpopularity of our political system, because whomever you choose, things could be done much better.

&gt;The lastest polls, that are everywhere, show that what i call radical left (think we can agree there), BE and CDU now have the same amount of votes combined than PSD. That is a huge development.

I highly doubt that. At least present some valid and unbiased sources to those claims, as I find it extremely odd. Sure, PSD is quite unpopular now but BE and CDU gather more votes than them? That can't be.

&gt;Merkel and Germany are the face of this European polici of austerity

Yes, and we can't blame them for them. Austerity isn't the root of our problems and it was us that seek them when the shit hit the fan and who deliberately agreed to the conditions they gave us if we accepted their help, which we did.

Again, we still have the chance of telling them to fuck off and that we don't need them, though things would be much worse on our end, I doubt we'd be able to afford most of things we've now became so used to.

What kind of Aufenthaltstitel do you have? There are different kinds, like

* Aufenthaltserlaubnis
* Niederlassungserlaubnis
* Erlaubnis zum Daueraufenthalt-EG
* Visum

The first **3** allow you to travel to other ""Schengen-states"" for 90 days per half-year. [source](http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Infoservice/FAQ/VisumFuerD/26-VisaDrittstaaten.html?nn=383016)

Schengen-stats are: [http://www.aufenthaltstitel.de/stichwort/schengen.html](http://www.aufenthaltstitel.de/stichwort/schengen.html).

I assume you have a limited (befristete) Aufenthaltserlaubnis. You are working here, right? Are you a normal employee, or are you doing an apprenticeship? In either case, you would probably have a limited residence permission.

There's also this:
&gt; Die ""Aussetzung der Abschiebung (Duldung)"" sowie die ""Aufenthaltsgestattung für Asylbewerber"" berechtigen nicht zur visumfreien Einreise in die anderen Schengenstaaten.

So, if you have requested asyl, you are not free to travel around. You need a visa in any case then.

Also, **where** do you want to go? Because apparently, that is also important.

&gt; Seit dem 05.04.2010 berechtigen ebenfalls nationale deutsche Visa der Kategorie ""D"" zu visumfreien Aufenthalten von bis zu 90 Tagen pro Halbjahr zu touristischen Zwecken in den anderen Schengen-Staaten.
[source](http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Infoservice/FAQ/VisumFuerD/26-VisaDrittstaaten.html?nn=383016)

Translation: Since 04/05/10 you are allowed to visit other Schengen-states for 90 days per half-year (visa-free) **if** you already got a national category ""D"" visa for Germany. But only if you want to visit other countires for tourist purposes (means no working or anything of the sorts).

**IF** I got it right, you still need a visa for any other countries that are not part of the ""Schengener Abkommen"". You can, however, contact the corresponding embassy of the country you want to visit and ask them, they will tell you what you need.
[Here's a list of embassies located in Germany, sorted by country name](http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/sid_76D61DAA931A51CDC2476C3B52D122F1/DE/Laenderinformationen/DtAuslandsvertretungenA-Z-Laenderauswahlseite_node.html), with addresses and phone numbers

In the information I found and linked, it states nowhere HOW you have to use the days that you are allowed to travel. Means you are probably free to use them all at once. However, I did not find anything about a 6 weeks permission. So I really need to know what kind of residence permission you have.

What many people miss is that if there is going to be a union calling itself European, not Maltese, Portuguese, or Swedish, it will eventually have a unified market. Nations would not compete with each other, but the EU will compete with other international players. In order to have this union, the Portuguese worker and the German worker should be able to afford the same quality of life. This is the reason why the Portuguese worker's salary increased. The prices in the poorer countries increased much more than the prices in richer countries, since the introduction of the Euro.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; unsustainable position of greece now, and for the next ten years

Which is largely caused by the Greek society itself. Greece is itself a relatively rich society, they have the money and the ability to take care of their citizens. The thing is that large enough group of Greeks don't want or believe in that, and that is very big reason why their state is dysfunctional.

Not to mention that the Greek position is going to worsen year by year because skewed population pyramid that is going to start making Greece little bit greyer every year, connect this to the fact that the pension system is inadequate to take care of all the coming pensioners.

No. The only option is for Greece to restructure their society until it starts to work. Eurozone can help in by organizing time, but the Greeks need to find the drivers of their economy by themselves.

&gt; there is going to be debt forgiveness from the ECB and participating nations, and that is called a ""transfer"" in anyones language

That is transfer, but it is totally different on having one time organization of debts versus permanent transfer of ever larger amounts of money.

&gt; the inevitable divergence that occurs within any political economy

Why is divergence bad? Divergence is good, markets shift resources where they are used the best. If a Eurozone country seems to start lacking behind others in economic growth, then that is a good signal for the politicians and people to restructure the system to enable higher growth.

&gt; first you will have a banking union with common deposit insurance &amp; common financial regulation

That will not create a permanent transfer mechanism, because deposit insurance will be paid by banks, and payment levels will be calculated based on different risks level that banks have.

&gt; third you will have a eurozone budget, separate from the EU budget, and it will be used to iron out economic divergance

Again, where does the need come to iron out economic divergence? The reason why some regions are poorer is because they create less value than others, you don't change that by pumping more money into the region, you fix that by letting the market act. In some case the market action will be depopulation of a whole region and relocation into regions that can create more value and growth.",0,1352813506,null,0,false,0,c70omf2,t3_133seo,t1_c70omf2,t1_c70nkp6,null,1430394113,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

About a year or two ago someone posted about how he had no idea that a lot of his paycheck would go the state and he was very unhappy. If you live here, part of your salary will finance our healthcare system, the free education system and the fairly high amount of social help for the unemployed. 
Also consider that most likely you have to buy furniture. Many apartments come without kitchen appliances or built in closets. You will have to get that organized before or try to buy used when you get here. You may also have to buy a car, depending on where in Munich you live. The public transport system is really good in the cities, but if you move to  the villages outside of Munich, it may be a pain in the ass and not as cheap as you might think. Make very sure you have all the information about expenses. Many people asked similar questions in this subreddit, you will find a lot info here. Also the website toytowngermany may have some info.

After you have crunched the numbers and have made a pro an contra list, consider this: Living in another country is awesome. It is certainly hard and confusing at times, but at the end of the day it will change your perception of things. You learn that nothing should be taken for granted, that just because things are different one thing isn't necessarily better. You will learn to make friends without your go-to story/joke/line etc. You will increase your ability to interpret body language, since you have to rely on that a lot.  You will see and learn a lot of new things and you will have to learn to be tolerant. You will also have to try to embrace those parts of the culture that you don't like. You will lover your country even more for what it has to offer and you will be angry that it doesn't solve its problems. You will have to defend the country in front of others and your own opinions, too. You will not know how to behave in certain situations and maybe sometimes be rude without wanting to. You will experience many misunderstandings and just deal with it. You will be like a fish out of the water that has to learn to breathe air. After you succeed to do so, your confidence  will have grown and your ability to cope with the unknown or to deal with new things will have improved greatly. You may have found new friendships that last a lifetime and have a second place in the world where you feel at home. After you go back, things are still the same, but you are different. That is sometimes hard and it takes getting used to the closed mindedness of those that never left. I would always recommend to live abroad. I did it twice and I have never regretted it.

It was the poll result, the Expresso poll, is not biased, the PSD dropped 12% and the BE and CDU both rose around 2% each making them both combined equal to the PSD, not that BE and CDU will ever combine mind you. It was sometime around the later half of september and is the last one I remember seeing.

There was no negotiation, with the troika, Socrates a lot of responsabilities in that but all the other parties also had, Socrates should have entered negotiations earlier and have something to negotiate, but the parties that voted against PEC4 made sure the government had no margin to have any negotiation and had to cave in on all troika demands. And calling help to the baillout is streching the limits, is not help by any definition of the word.

The best price by air (RyanAir) is 44 euros for ~1,5 hours trip but with a departure from Beauvais airport which is 70 km outside of Paris... In the middle of nowhere.

true,radaway,PORT,Portugal,"&gt; Yes, and we can't blame them for them. Austerity isn't the root of our problems and it was us that seek them when the shit hit the fan and who deliberately agreed to the conditions they gave us if we accepted their help, which we did.  
  
I agree with the rest of your post but I disagree with this paragraph. Our situation is certainly our fault, given how fragile, inefficient and exposed our economy was, however it's not just our situation it's Europe's situation, we're just one of the mine canaries. We are not the only troubled country and we may have structural problems but so does Europe.  
  
Also austerity, as it's currently applied, may not be the root of our problems but it is compounding our problems, as I think we agreed in our multiplier argument another day.  
  
The way Europe chose to deal with this crisis was not the only one and Germany was certainly one of it's most staunch defenders and pretty much the leader of the union.  
  
Given that, without a change of course in Europe, spray and pray austerity and raising taxes is, as you correctly say, all we can do unless we want to default. It's fair in my opinion to at least partially blame Germany. As what is needed is a strategy for the Eurozone, structural reforms of the Eurozone, not this delaying, and making it worse, we have been doing.  
  
Anyway, as more and more countries get (sadly) dragged into this, the policy will have to change, and maybe Merkel won't mind saying she was wrong after the elections.  
  
&gt; Again, we still have the chance of telling them to fuck off and that we don't need them, though things would be much worse on our end
  
We must certainly not forget this. If Europe doesn't change course, we keep destroying value the way we have been doing, and going farther away from any chance of sustainability, this may be our only course of action and, if it is to be, the sooner the better.  
  
People keep saying it would be much worse on our end but I'm not so sure anymore. I think what would be much worse is having to do it anyway after 5 years of austerity and fire sales.  ",0,1352818039,null,0,false,0,c70pfsy,t3_133tib,t1_c70pfsy,t1_c70o8cm,null,1430394501,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Especially since you mention you have rare skills, absolutely negotiate for something more substantial. (You'd still live decently on 50k, but, you know, you deserve more).

Check the German branch's policy on overtime. In many companies here, you don't get paid for overtime but get to redeem it for days off. That's only nice if you have a job that allows you to take these days off; if you work by objectives or have a managerial function it can be more of a hassle than it's worth.

When you drive a car, you only think of the gas - or do you also calculate how much the car cost, how much the car maintenance costs and, above all else **how much you are paying in taxes to fund the roads**. 

If all the highways were behind toll booths, we would perhaps see the cost structure more clearly.

This is the most important reason. Second, in many places bus companies get tax funds to keep the ticket prices low - but trains have a monopoly so they are deemed to be profitable by themselves. In Finland (in many other European countries) we also have the problem that the monopoly for trains is granted against promise to serve all areas where rails have been laid - without taking into account are those rails actually in use by commuters. So, the most busy sections, namely Tampere-Helsinki, Turku-Helsinki and Turku-Tampere are hugely overpriced to fund the other parts of the network.

Comparing the cheapest way to travel by car and by train:

Distance between Vienna and Munich (maps.google.at) 434 km.
**Cheapest train-ticket** for that route is **39,- Euros** (www.oebb.at)

Cheapest car regarding Euros/km that I could find (www.adac.de) is Toyota Aygo 1.0 with 28 cent/km.
Therefore a **trip by car** from Vienna to Munich would cost **121.52 Euros**.

So it is actually way cheaper to go by train than by car if you take into account all the costs and not just the gas.

If you look at inner city travel for example trains pretty much everywhere beat taxis. In short the sole goal of the german railway system is to create an affordable transport for populace for short and medium distances. Comparison to airplanes is thus not adequate.

As a personal anecdote: I grew up in a rural region in southern Germany - hometown had about 10000 inhabitants - traveling to the next town of similar size by taxi costed about 8 €. Travelling by train was at about a quarter of that prize.

Skiing is way harder in the beginning and can be more frustrating.

* I want to cruise in the powder snow and do stunts --&gt; Snowboard.

Of course people will argue that you can also ride a Raceboard and be as fast as a skier, but a raceboard is basically a mono-ski and does not have too much in common with frestyle snowboarding.

L'analyse du CSMF sur la pseudo limite que la ministre prétend avoir imposé : ""Le caractère « excessif » sera apprécié non pas acte par acte mais au regard  de la pratique globale du médecin, en tenant compte, notamment, de la fréquence des actes par patient, du lieu d’implantation du cabinet et de la spécialité. « Les commissions régionales auront à leur disposition un ensemble de critères de sélection au sein desquels, le taux de dépassement de 150 % du tarif opposable pourra servir de repère. Ce taux pourra faire l’objet d’adaptation dans certaines zones géographiques limitées », ce qui sera évidemment le cas pour Paris et certaines grandes villes.
En clair, le taux de 150% (soit 2 fois et demi le tarif opposable) n’est qu’un indicateur parmi d’autres, il n’est pas un plafond. Il n’est mentionné que dans le préambule à titre d’affichage, et n’est pas repris à l’article 3 des critères retenus pour caractériser une pratique tarifaire abusive. Les commissions paritaires régionales ont donc toute la plus grande souplesse et toute latitude pour décider s’il y a « dépassement abusif » ou non, en particulier en tenant compte des spécificités locales.""

Résultat :  ""Alors qu’il prévoyait d’inclure les plus-values de cession au régime de l’imposition sur le revenu, le ministre des finances, Pierre Moscovici, a finalement annoncé le maintien du « régime spécifique » antérieur : les plus-values de cession continueront à être imposées à 19 %, auxquels s’ajoutent les taxes sociales (CSG et RDS) , soit 35 % au total. De plus, l’entrepreneur bénéficiera d’une exonération sur la partie de l’argent qu’il réinvestit, quel qu'en soit le montant, alors que le projet initial prévoyait un réinvestissement minimum de 80 %. Enfin, les abattements prévus pour le calcul des plus-values en fonction de la durée de détention de réaménagement seront révisés.""

Si beaucoup pensent que le combat pour faire accepter l'homosexualité est en train d'être gagné, il serait opportun à ces personnes de se rappeler que l'histoire de l'homosexualité n'est pas une ligne droite qui va de plus en plus vers l'acceptation. Il n'y a pas un avant qui serait fait de rejet, de souffrance et de répression et un maintenant plus heureux qui serait chose acquise. Comme le montre le passé, les homosexuels ont déjà connu des période de relative tolérance à leur égard, (notamment en grèce antique et dans l'allemagne pré- nazie) ce qui n'a pas empéché d'être persécutés quelques temps après alors qu'on pensait alors que rien ne pouvait arréter la marche vers leur totale intégration dans la société. Il semble donc intéressant de retracer l'histoire de l'homosexualité pour rappeler que le combat ne s'arrétera jamais et qu'il est nécessaire de rester vigilant.

However increasing the population and ethnic and cultural diversity,  at the scale of EU,  you will get maybe hundreds of large groups wanting different things.

It's getting better, but only very, very slowly.

Also, historically, rail companies loves insanely complicated fare systems. The price that you see first is always absurdly high and almost always you can get much better, if you can navigate in the tariff.

And another point, long distance rail travel is only slowly recovering from a decline when it lost most of the share to the airplanes.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"I don't think this will be very popular, but in my opinion it's because rail is an inherently more expensive way to travel than the alternatives. For instance, compare the different costs for a high speed rail route against a coach route. Even if the train line has one train every ten minutes, which is very high utilization, most of the time the track is empty and unused, whereas a coach travels on a motorway which can be full of tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of people at the same time. Then think of the degree of tolerance which there is in maintaining a motorway in comparison to a high speed rail track, once you have foundations, with a motorway you can just slather on some tarmac or concrete and roll it out, a train track has to be perfect within millimeters, and regularly checked so that it stays that way. Think of all the staff required to maintain and run a station, and plan and direct train services, and the cost of building train lines through cities (whereas the roads are already paid for because they are useful for local traffic).  Coaches or cars can also switch without prior planning from one road to another in seconds, and services can be quickly commissioned or cancelled to respond to changes in demand.

In my experience, everyone in Europe complains that their trains are badly run, but it's not an issue of governance, it's just that all forms of transport have different inherent costs, and rail is in most circumstances more expensive than the alternatives.

Nur um die Demos *dürfen* sich diese Leute natürlich aus gutem Grund nicht kümmern. Schutzt gegen Überfälle und Terroranschläge wird von den Konzernen, deren Brennstäbe transportiert werden, selbst bezahlt.

[Die Kosten sind natürlich vernachlässigbar im Vergleich zu den Kosten für den Polizeieinsatz, der wegen der Demos nötig ist. Aber es ist völlig logisch und unumgänglich, dass diesen Einsatz *nicht* die Konzerne zahlen. Die haben schließlich keine Kontrolle über diese Demo und haben sie nicht bestellt und nicht gewünscht. Wenn irgendwo eine Demo gegen ein geplantes Windkraftwerk stattfindet, muss für einen möglichen Polizeiteinsatz ja selbstverständlich auch nicht der Betreiber des Windkraftwerks bezahlen.]

Rückstellungen: Ja, Rückstellungen sind steuerfrei. Meines Wissens sind Rückstellungen das immer, das ist soweit noch keine Besonderheit. (Ich kann mich hier irren, ich weiß wenig von Bilanzrecht.)
Die vielen angesparten Milliarden wurden seit Jahrzehnten tatsächlich von E.on&amp;Co. eingesetzt, um Übernahmen und dergleichen zu finanzieren. (Meines Wissens liegt hier die Subvention, weil die Rückstellungen, solange sie nicht gebraucht wurden, irgendwie freier eingesetzt werden konnten als üblich - aber wie gesagt, ich bin da kein Experte. Die Behauptung an sich kenn ich nur aus der Anti-AKW-Ecke, wo sie immer mal wieder leicht unscharf formuliert wird. Ist halt auch kompliziert.) Das Geld ist aber dadurch nicht weg, es wird nichtmal weniger, es sind immer noch viele Milliarden. Eher zuviel als zuwenig für die nötigen Rückbauten.*

Ich gehe dabei davon aus, dass diese Rückstellungen von genau den Unternehmen gebildet wurden, die auch tatsächlich Rückbauverpflichtungen haben -  sollte es anders sein, wäre das natürlich wirklich Blödsinn; ich halte das aber für abwegig und habe keine Lust, mir die Mühe zu machen, es definitiv rauszufinden. 

Mit der Endlagerung ist das anders, klar. Wieder kann man erstmal argumentieren, dass es auch bloß gut ist, dass die Konzerne nicht einfach das Recht haben, irgendwo auf eigene Faust ein Endlager zu bauen; und dass es also bloß gut ist, dass der Bund hier die volle Kontrolle hat.
Wichtiger ist aber noch, dass der Bund eh ein Endlager braucht; jedenfalls genau so dringend wie die Energiekonzerne: für Abfälle aus den Forschungsreaktoren. (Möglicherweise auch für die geringen Mengen radioaktiven Abfalls aus der Medizin; auch wenn ich hier nicht weiß, ob wirklich langlebige Isotope anfallen, für die sich eine Endlagerung lohnt.) 
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forschungsreaktor#Forschungsreaktoren_in_Deutschland

Wie groß ein Endlager ist, spielt für die Kosten kaum noch eine Rolle, ein zweites Endlager nur für private Abfälle zu fordern wäre in jedem Fall völlig unsinnig. Der Bund hat daher schon in den Fünfzigern erklärt, die Endlagerung zu übernehmen - zu einer Zeit also, als die Gesellschaft noch recht geschlossen die Nutzung der Kernkraft befürwortet hat.

Edit: *Nur, weil ich eh schon wieder so ne Wand von Text geschrieben habe, hier noch eine kleine Randnotiz: dass überhaupt Rückstellungen für den Rückbau gebildet werden müssen, ist mW bei Industrieanlagen nicht üblich. Kohlekraftwerke können einfach stehen bleiben und langsam vergammeln, aus Kernkraftwerken werden wieder grüne Wiesen. Besonders lustig könnte das noch bei Windkraftwerken werden: da stehen in zwanzig-vierzig Jahren tausende Türme an der Küste rum, die langsam den Geist aufgeben und eventuell nur dann wieder abgebaut werden, wenn jemand anders den Bauplatz für ein neues WKW haben will. (Oder für den Schrottwert. Der, immerhin, dürfte meist Anreiz genug sein.)",0,1352832730,null,0,1352833382,0,c70t07l,t3_12t4a7,t1_c70t07l,t1_c70s6l3,null,1430396171,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

It should be added that the roads paid by the provinces/towns are the majority and the E-roads the minority as far as maintenance costs are tallied.

You are correct in as much that the gas tax brings in 2,5 billion euros, which about four times the amount state uses for roads.

I would never vote for this man because of some of the nationalist ideas that he and his party represents, but I'm plesantly surprised by his proactivity and taking on difficult subjects, something which his predecessor never did.

During WW2 Hungary and Serbia/Yugoslavia were on opposing sides, and in 1941 Hungary committed a war crime by killing thousands of Serbs and Jews. These crimes are widely recognized and are remembered every year ever since.

However, by the end of the war the Hungarian army retreated and the Yugoslav communists killed thousands of ethnic Hungarians in revenge. During communism it was forbidden to talk about this, and later under Milosevic it was denied the crimes ever happenned. After Milosevic the crime was investigated and was published in several papers, but the people in power never dealt with the issue and it remained unknown to the wider public. For me it's very surprising that a man who is known for his nationalist rhetoric and ideology would do something like this, to admit that the crimes did happen and then agree to pay tribute to the victims.

&gt; The two presidents told reporters after the meeting in Budapest that he would soon pay tribute ""to the victims of crimes committed in Novi Sad in 1942 and in Vojvodina in 1944 and 1945"".

When will this stop?

Whomever said this massive debt could be solved in a couple of years was not speaking the truth. Sócrates himself took 6 whole years to raise the public debt to GDP ratio from 50% to 110%, how the heck could we ever drive this back down to acceptable levels in such a short period of time? It will stop, eventually, when the debt isn't no longer an issue, till then, unfortunately, we don't have much choice, do we?

&gt;Suddently the alternative how much radical they can seem start to become have more appeal then this never ending path of destruction.

What alternative? You need to deal with the public debt - you either increase the tax rates (we've already done some of that and our taxes are already immense, this has serious long-term impacts in our competitiveness) or you increase the taxable matter aka the economy (which is proving immensely difficult to do considering our unattractiveness - who'd want to invest in a country with our tax rates, with our justice system, with our labour market restrictions and with our regulation and bureaucracy?) or you decrease public spending (which is what we're doing - since increasing taxes is more harmful than good in the long run and since the economy needs to be reformed to regain competitiveness - austerity is the only viable short-term solution).

You're absolutely right that this is a raw deal, but it's one which we need to accept simply because there are no other viable alternatives. In a better world, we'd have more time to deal with this or we'd have lower interest rates or we'd have never got this whole debt in the first place, but unfortunately, this isn't the case, and between slashing public spending in everything deemed unnecessary (which is what we're doing) and either increasing public spending in an effort to stimulate growth (which is what were doing in the first place and what played a major role in getting us in this situation) or defaulting on our debts (which would be much more drastic and serious than any austerity, it would be like amputating a leg because it hurts to disinfect it), the choice seems pretty clear to me - we have no choice.",0,1352838328,null,0,false,0,c70urwn,t3_133tib,t1_c70urwn,t1_c70p268,null,1430397008,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

J’apprécie vos articles que je lis souvent avec attention, mais il semble que pour celui-ci les informations dont vous disposez semblent partielles et partiales. 
Les enfants issus de l’immigration sud-asiatiques réussissent fort bien, souvent mieux que les nationaux. Ce phénomène est d’ailleurs analysé depuis longtemps outre-atlantique et ce reportage http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7Ys... 
ainsi que cet article récent du Monde

proposent quelques pistes de réflexion.
Globalement les filles s’en sortent mieux que leurs frères, souvent élevés comme des « petits rois », et les enfants d’origine turque, maghrébine et africaine rencontrent plus de difficultés que d’autres, et ce pour des rasions culturelles. Deux élèves sur trois qui sortent de l’école sans aucun diplôme sont issus de l’immigration : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTDO...

Blâmer l'immigration pour tout n'est pas une bonne chose, je ne dis pas le contraire. Mais le courant ""antiraciste"" qui consiste à ne surtout pas accepter l'origine d'un problème si elle pourrait être interpréte comme raciste est stupide.

Je vis moi-même dans des quartiers défavorisés du 92, et oui les garçons d'origine maghrébines s'en sortent moins bien, c'est indéniable pour toute personne venant constater sur place (rédiger son article dans les lycées privés de Neuilly, en critiquant les enfoirés de raciste est facile, vérifier la véracité de ses dires l'est aussi... étrange que si peu le fassent...).

Pourquoi? Les parents ont tendance à défendre l'enfant (lorsque j'étais en primaire, la directrice de mon établissement avait reçu des menaces de mort de parents mécontents que leur enfant ait reçu une punition), à ne pas pouvoir aider leurs enfants, ou à ne tout simplement pas les pousser à réussir...


Je pense vraiment que cet antiracisme nous empêche d'avancer, de parler des problèmes de violences, d'agression permanente (une fille se fera forcément emmerder dans certains quartier, et pourtant les féministe préfèrent faire de la prostitution leur combat..), d'emploi, ou d'éducation.

Except in cases where the constitution says otherwise [(for a complete list of those exceptions, see this German Wikipedia article)](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zustimmungsbedürftiges_Gesetz) the Bundestag can override vetos from the Bundesrat with an absolute majority (i.e. a majority of all its members). If two thirds of the Bundesrat veto (which basically never happens†), the Bundestag can override the veto with a two-thirds majority of all present members, but at least a majority of all its members.

What this means is that vetos are extremely easy to break and basically meaningless. If a bill could pass the Bundestag it is practically certain that the Bundestag could also break the veto. The consequence of this is that the Bundesrat has no bargaining power and doesn’t even really try to fight them. For all intents and purposes the Bundesrat can’t stop those bills.

Now, it’s not like the list of exceptions is short. There are quite a few bills that the Bundesrat can outright kill – but it has limited creative power in shaping a bill – and that is really the reason why it is most certainly not the legislative center of Germany. (In the US you can rightfully say that both the Senate and the House are equal legislative centers. That is most certainly not the case in Germany. The Bundestag stands above everything else.)

For example, every bill starts its life in the Bundestag. It’s debated there, it’s discussed in detail and changed in committees, it’s first voted on there. Only after that brutal process is it sent to the Bundesrat, including all the changes. So even if a majority of the Bundesrat decides to draft a bill, that bill is then first sent to the Bundestag for debate and changes. By the time it arrives again in the Bundesrat it might not even be recognizable anymore.

And the Bundesrat itself can do nothing about that. It has no creative power. It cannot, on itself, change anything. It can only vote against the bill. While the Bundestag can happily make a bill bend to its will, all the Bundesrat can do is disagree. In its nature it isn’t really a deliberative body that debates which changes would be best, it just says yay or nay.

After the Bundesrat disagrees, the bill is sent to a mediation committee. That committee consists of an equal number of members of both Bundesrat and Bundestag. This is really the only place where the Bundesrat can really articulate what it wants changed, but it all has to happen on a consensus basis (because of the makeup of the committee).

All this makes the Bundesrat not quite as powerful as it might seem. Yes, it always gets to say its opinion, it is always involved in some way in the lawmaking process, but often it can do nothing to stop laws and, from its construction, it doesn’t really have much life of its own.

I think it would be important to stress the *huge* culinary diversity in France, as well as the overwhelming importance that is placed on food, meal times, and the social and family aspects surrounding eating. If they leave your class not knowing what an ""apéro"" is and how prevalent it is in French culture, they missed out.

Every region has its own dishes, cheeses, traditions, wines, and styles, and they differ dramatically. I'd break them into groups, assign each group a region of France, and make them research the culinary traditions of the region and report back on the traditional dishes and wines.

Most of the well-known dishes and most sauces are made with wine or other alcohols, which may not go over well in a high school context in the US. Could be a tough call...

The ""only on a dare"" foods are fun for American kids (and adults) to learn about as well: boudin noir, escargot, pied de cochon, tête de veau, etc... Not that I'd try to serve it to them. =)

[750g.com](http://www.750g.com) is a superb French recipe site.

Some ideas that don't use alcohol, or it's cooked down:

* Soufflé
* Boeuf bourguignon (if you can cook it ahead of time)
* Cassoulet
* Homemade crème fraîche, since it's nearly impossible to find in the US and horribly expensive when you do. (Add a couple tablespoons of buttermilk to heavy whipping cream and let it sit out for a day or two.)
* [Choucroûte d'Alsace](http://www.750g.com/fiche_de_cuisine.2.123.37964.htm)
* Croque monsieur
* Google image search the word ""verrines"". They're the in thing over here right now. You could have your students try to research some recipes/ideas

true,radaway,PORT,Portugal,"&gt; So, at the Portuguese level, you do agree that we must continue with austerity, right? Or do you think that we should default and end this once and for all?

I've already said it more than once. At the Portuguese level, we have to start seriously considering defaulting and exiting the Euro unless the Eurozone changes course. Because austerity is no solution, it makes things slowly worse while keeping us afloat with foreign loans, eventually the loaners will see things are even worse than when the ""rescue"" started and then we will have to default and exit the Euro anyway.  
  
Might as well do it now than when things are much worse after more 5 years of austerity. The only reason we have to stay right now is the hope that the Eurozone will change course. That is also the only reason I haven't been advocating more for this.   
  
&gt; Portugal has a debt to GDP growth over 100% and the economy is stagnant.. how can we ignore this? How could this not be our #1 priority??

The economy is stagnant because of the austerity policies being followed not just by us, but by many of our main trading partners in Europe. If it were just us, we might actually be doing ok.    
  
The United States after WWII had a much higher debt to ratio than that, yet they not only came out of the war with the Great Depression problem solved but they also paid that debt.  
  
And yes, I'm all for inflation, Europeans apparently think inflation is a moral or ethical problem, I don't see it.  
  
How is it acceptable for States to bailout banks, but inflation who also helps the people that are having problems, isn't? How is it acceptable to have 25% unemployment but inflation isn't?  
  
We wouldn't have much inflation anyway, the Eurozone could easily print at least as much as the US did since we are a bigger economy.  
  
&gt; Investing in a 150% public debt to GDP ratio is much less appealing than it would if it was a 50% or 5% ratio

I don't see that effect, as long as there is growth and the interest rates are low, that just doesn't happen. You know how you can get growth and low interest rates? You get Eurobonds and let the central banks do their fucking jobs instead of being in a Euro standard straight jacket.

Because trains, just like your car, are made of capital, not magic. In addition to the capital cost of your car, you also pay for its maintenance and fuel. Plus, you pay taxes to keep the roads on which your car drives.

The train system still has to charge you for all of those costs, plus the cost of all of its staff executing other functions, like driving. 

In exchange for the higher cost you get (a) more space than in your car (b) the ability to do something other than drive (c) the advantage of a trip that runs on a mostly fixed schedule.

Unfortunately, Portugal does not possess the natural resources of Argentina or Russia, nor the transparency and economic flexibility observed in a micro nations such as Iceland. 

Are you serious? Inflation is a tax on savers and on the lower strata of the population, it helps corrupt and profligate institutions the most at the expense of those who hold cash (pro-tip: while the rich hold assets, the poor tend to hold cash). It washes away the traces of corruption and reduces accountability. As such, inflating debt away is akin to stealing and provides a perverse incentive to keep making the same mistakes ad nauseam. In addition, high inflation has other economic costs of its own. If there's something Portugal does not need, it's high inflation.

Unemployment is high because wages are sticky in the short run, a more flexible labour market would likely register high levels of unemployment for lower periods of time when adjusting. Labor reforms are still lacking.

What? Defaulting? How would you even afford to keep the hospitals running, the schools open, policemen being paid their wages, retired people receiving their pensions, etc, with a default?

You know what a default means, right? It means declaring bankruptcy, it means nobody will loan you anything unless it is at astronomical interest rates. How can you defend this as an alternative to austerity when it's much more violent and damaging? How can you expect to keep the state running when it still presents considerable deficits and you destroy the possibility of it being financed both from the outside and from the inside?

Furthermore, exiting the euro and then what? Make the escudo worth peanuts? How would you afford to import energy, food or all those other goods in which we're not self-sufficient? And bear in mind that most of our exports are to the eurozone, would we really benefit on foreign markets if our currency was not the same as theirs but was instead as worthless as a Zimbabwean dollar?

&gt;Might as well do it now than when things are much worse after more 5 years of austerity.

Worse than 5 years of austerity? The alternative you just presented was probably worse than 50 years of austerity, defaulting and getting a new currency would be essentially disconnecting us from Europe and disallowing us from ever coming back!

&gt;The economy is stagnant because of the austerity policies being followed not just by us, but by many of our main trading partners in Europe. If it were just us, we might actually be doing ok.

[The economy has been stagnant for over a decade now.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/gdp-growth) Austerity is a new thing, before that, we've had spending spending spending, and since 2001 that the economy is always having minimal growth. You talk as if the economy was booming but suddenly austerity came and we're now stranded in this situation when the reality is nothing like it, we've been stranded and without any substantial growth for over 10 years now.

[The same can't be said about our spending](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/government-debt-to-gdp) which is the main culprit, it more than doubled in only 10 years. Even with a stagnant economy, we'd be fine with some ~50% debt to GDP ratio (like we had some 12 years ago), it would be well below the 60% of the Euro convergence criteria.

Economic growth isn't caused by government spending, it's government spending that must be depended on economic growth. In fact, I just demonstrated to you that despite the government spending, the economy stayed the same. While we don't tackle the problem of the lack of economic growth, we must deal with the problem of the public debt as to prevent the economic growth problem from being even more serious, and there's only one solution to the public debt, austerity.

&gt;The United States after WWII had a much higher debt to ratio than that, yet they not only came out of the war with the Great Depression problem solved but they also paid that debt. 

Yeah, but after WW2 the USA were also the only superpower. What were they main competitors? [Everyone else was devastated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_World_War_II#Immediate_effects)!

&gt;And yes, I'm all for inflation, Europeans apparently think inflation is a moral or ethical problem, I don't see it. 

Where's the incentive to save and invest in the future if tomorrow everything is worth less? It promotes frugal spending and disincentives a sustainable growth in the economy.

I don't know how about you, but if I was working all my life to save up for retirement, I'd hate to get old and see my life savings only worth half or a fourth of what I worked for. And this is simply an example, inflation eats all these long-term saving up.

&gt;How is it acceptable for States to bailout banks, but inflation who also helps the people that are having problems, isn't?

Bailing out banks? That's unacceptable if you ask me. But even more unacceptable are banks failing in the first place because bankers were reckless and gambled with their clients' money. But this is besides the point, this shouldn't be economic policy and the role of government, it should be the judicial system and the courts.

&gt;How is it acceptable to have 25% unemployment but inflation isn't? 

25% unemployment rate? That's also unacceptable if you ask me. But then again, government can't create long term employment like that, even in Portugal you already have a clear excess in public workers.

I'd personally fix this by zeroing corporate taxes - anything you'd lose in revenues you'd increase in employment, available income, social stability, increased investment and associated economies, but this is my personal opinion and it might be too bold, I just assume that nobody ever did this because they've done the math and figured out it wasn't worth it, but I personally don't know.

Or maybe because you can't just slash taxes massively, you also need to cut bureaucracy, liberalise the labour market, make the justice system more efficient, among other things, and this is an heck of a reform which would certainly take years to gather public support, be discussed and implemented. I dunno.

&gt;We wouldn't have much inflation anyway, the Eurozone could easily print at least as much as the US did since we are a bigger economy. 

The eurozone will never inflate like that and I've already demonstrated how serious the impacts of us leaving the euro and inflating our currency can have in our economy.

&gt;I don't see that effect, as long as there is growth and the interest rates are low, that just doesn't happen.

As long as there is growth, yes. Unfortunately, this isn't the case.

&gt;You know how you can get growth and low interest rates? You get Eurobonds and let the central banks do their fucking jobs instead of being in a Euro standard straight jacket. 

All the eurobonds in the world wouldn't be enough if we continued with our structural problems, we'd just drag the rest of the EU down like we're doing now.

&gt;The Eurobonds/Federation will take time

While I do agree on the Eurobonds, we need to fix the public debt and the growth first for this to be reliable. And this will still take time.

That's not entirely true. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austerity :

&gt; In economics, austerity refers to a policy of deficit-cutting by lowering spending via a reduction in the amount of benefits and public services provided. Austerity policies are often used by governments to try to reduce their deficit spending and are sometimes coupled with increases in taxes to demonstrate long-term fiscal solvency to creditors.

Anyway, reread my previous post. I added something in end you may have missed that is the very definition of austerity. Cutting on healthcare and education and taxing the middle class will only destroy the economy further. If austerity aims at the recover of the economy, then the reforms must be done elsewhere.

true,radaway,PORT,Portugal,"&gt; Given no shocks, such as social meltdown, assuming that a spiral of doom will take place until infinity after the capital hemorrhage from the periphery is dealt with isn't a sound preposition. 
  
There are no equilibriums when you're dealing with an exponential function such as the one caused by our debt and interest rates. There is no reason at all to expect the capital hemorrhage from the periphery to stop until, the periphery defaults.  
  
&gt; A default would just mean that your standard of living would plummet to similar lows achievable at the height of austerity. 
  
Sure, but then it would get better. With the current austerity then it only gets worse.  Have you not seen the 0.9-1.7 multiplier calculated by the IMF for austerity? The math is out, the current path only leads to higher and higher debt to GDP ratio, this means that there will be no equilibrium.  
  
&gt; Inflation is a tax on savers and on the lower strata of the population, it helps corrupt and profligate institutions the most at the expense of those who hold cash (pro-tip: while the rich hold assets, the poor tend to hold cash).

I don't know where do you live, but where I live the poor have no cash, are probably indebted and now they don't even have a job, the rich have assets but they've used them as collateral, the assets devalued and now the rich are a huge burden on the banks.  
  
I don't see any losers here.  
  
The only losers with inflation are relatively rich people who don't use their savings in a productive way, and frankly I'm ok with that.
  
Another potential loser are worker wages, but given that this would also lead to less unemployment (as the economy picks up thanks to quicker and easier deleveraging) this would probably not be a problem. It would certainly have less of an effect than the huge unemployment we're facing.  
  
What is akin to stealing is keeping the current path, you are stealing people of their prospects, their pensions (which with so many unnemployed the state can no longer pay), and for many unemployed youth their very future. You are also stealing countries by means of fire sale of important and profitable infrastructures and companies. 
  
&gt; The US is not comparable to either the EZ or any country under bailout, even without monetary policy restrictions.  
  
The US is very comparable to the EZ or at least should be a model to follow, as they're a monetary zone that actually works.  
  
&gt; you still couldn't sell it to the electorate. 

This isn't really an argument since many things that the electorate doesn't want are actually good and vice versa. Anyway I don't believe it. You can sell anything you want to the electorate as is proven by the many misconceptions around this crisis. All you need to do is to start spreading the narrative of the horrible collapse the world will have if we don't do it.

&gt;
&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austerity :
&gt;
&gt;&gt; In economics, austerity refers to a policy of deficit-cutting by lowering spending via a reduction in the amount of benefits and public services provided. Austerity policies are often used by governments to try to reduce their deficit spending and are sometimes coupled with increases in taxes to demonstrate long-term fiscal solvency to creditors.


Your quote is proving me right. It's what I said, austerity is cutting spending, not increasing revenues. You were the one that said that taxes were austerity and I just pointed out they weren't. Reducing benefits and public services is cutting spending, taxes like you mentioned is increasing revenues. While they both contribute to the state budget and the public debt, they're the exact opposite.

&gt;the alternative is austerity that makes meaningful reforms in spending regarding public contracts, instead of cutting on education, healthcare, justice, etc. In fact if these reforms were truly achieved, taxing the stockmarket and other transactions wouldn't even be necessary.

Yeah, the PPPs are very harming to our economy but it's not only that, they don't explain a debt to GDP ratio over 100%. More needs to be cut and all public services need to be run more efficiently. Obvious we can't cut healthcare, education and justice, I'm with you in this (fuck, I almost feel bad by just agreeing with you on small things) but you can't just fix the PPPs and leave everything else as it is when the government still presents deficits.

&gt;Cutting on healthcare and education and taxing the middle class will only destroy the economy further.

I... ugh... yeah, I agree, you're right. Cutting on healthcare and on education is cutting on our future and taxing is making us more uncompetitive, promoting unemployment and encouraging emigration. If anything we should slash public spending on all the non-essential areas (so everything not justice, security, education and healthcare related) and also bring taxes as low as possible - it's imperative if we want to promote economic growth and continue to be able to afford to have some sort of functional welfare state.

&gt;There's plenty of public spending in need of deep reforms in Portugal. Healthcare, education, justice, etc. certainly are't a priority.

true,triceratopos,null,null,"That is false and it can easily be demonstrated by a reduction to absurdity. Even if you assume that no tax revenues exist, when the primary state budget asymptotically approaches zero by virtue of expenditure cuts, then the state will no longer be a participant in the economy. However, the economy does not disappear. When you introduce interest payments balanced with tax receipts (assuming that the tax rate is not 100 percent), it's obvious that an equilibrium level of expenditure exists where the budget is balanced and the economy, by virtue of the private sector, has not disappeared. 

While, the multiplier effect highlights the behavior of one variable, in this case GDP, in relation to changes in another, government expenditure, it does not account for opportunity costs. What is the multiplier effect of private investment or private consumption? Ignoring foreign debt, increasing taxes and government expenditure will result in a drop in private consumption and investment, which have multipliers of their own. Which leads to a healthier economy?

When the government consumes private savings and the return on investment is below the market rate (such as by building roads to nowhere, engaging in corruption, etc) then we have an inefficient situation. The same principle applies to foreign debt. Government spending is, however, useful to smooth economic shocks when private investment and consumption is depressed for whatever reason (e.g. a crisis). With no monetary policy to speak of, debt dynamics in Portugal no longer allow the government to use this mechanism as interest rates have surpassed economic growth for over a decade. This is barely an argument to ruin the country's creditworthiness and condemning the people to poverty overnight, however. 

In fact, this situation tells you that government expenditure has been highly unproductive and has been mainly funneled towards immediate consumption. Obviously, when funding is cut, consumption has to climb down to the productive capacity of the country. Your suggestion of a default, not unlike austerity, has only one outcome as consumption will convergence towards the productive capacity of the country. With the exception that an abrupt drop in living standards can potentially lead to much worse outcomes. 

While you're correct that unemployment is a plague and SHOULD be addressed by the Eurozone in conjunction, the sad reality is that the Euro countries failed to prepare for a contingency such as this and political rhetoric has left very little room for maneuver. Instead, they waved it as an impossibility, as bureaucrats often love to do. After all, despite all the EMU framework inconsistencies, they legislated against it, so why would debt ever go above 60% of GDP? /s

However, I can't accept your argument in favor of inflation. You said it yourself, wages are gobbled up overnight. In the event of inflation, asset prices will increase. After all is said and done, the gap between the rich and the poor will have increased. Austerity aimed at achieving internal devaluation is supposed to do the same thing without sacrificing savings, but due to rigidities in labour markets this takes a very long time. Hence, you have unemployment. Furthermore, make no mistake, high inflation will crush the real purchasing power of pensions and social benefits or debt would be required again. 

So you consider not being able to find a job ""stealing someone's future""? A valid interpretation, mind you. But you're OK with literally forcing the middle class and the poor to pay for the mistakes of politicians? Let me tell you, that's probably generational bias at work. I'm sorry, I don't deem properly executed privatizations as theft. If the current conjecture leads to offers being below market value, then the privatization should probably have been carried out earlier. Hell, maybe this whole situation could have been avoided if the state didn't have cronies meddling with every single public enterprise. 

To sum it up, as I said previously, inflation is a seemingly painless fix that would give positive reinforcement to bad policy-making and the country would suffer from it in the long-run. Reneging on Portuguese debt and taking over monetary policy simultaneous might alleviate unemployment, but on the other hand, governance would remain abysmal, living standards would plummet overnight, and investment would be hard capped as access to debt would be restricted for a country that is not rich in natural resources. Now incorporate the consequences of breaking a myriad of international contracts and obligations - things start to look less than rosy.

Thankfully, capital flight is being addressed by the banking union, I'm positive that future EZ summits will keep addressing the problem. Otherwise, austerity or no austerity, the EMU will collapse. Nonetheless, the US is nothing like Europe. Even if Europe was federalized and modeled after the US, the levels of economic flexibility in both regions is not comparable at all. In addition, the US controls the de facto reserve currency of the world, has the ability to project force worldwide and tends to dictate the status quo of world affairs. In short, the US can afford to run deficits.

Western european culture and success didn't exactly magically appear out of the ground, we made so many mistakes that even the small percentage we learned from brought us so far. And they have the advantage to look at our mistakes without repeating them.

There are 3 places on this earth that give you optimal position to become the leading force of the planet:

+ Europe

+ China

+ North America

and while N. America didn't even made it past hunter and gather (mostly)
Europe's and China's main difference regarding this topic is, that China is and was a (mostly) united Empire, while the europeans fought hundreds of wars against each other.

That is why we conquered the world, and brought man on the moon, while other people (without our interference) would still live under stone age conditions. 

We're all equal human beings, equally smart and able to learn. The only difference is europe's ""starting capital"" and our many, many mistakes.

&gt;After the 31-year-old dentist was told that she was miscarrying, her husband reportedly said that she had asked for a medical termination a number of times over a three day period, during which she was in severe pain.

&gt;But he said these requests were denied because a foetal heartbeat was still present and they were told at one point: ""This is a Catholic country.""

&gt;Medical staff removed the dead foetus days later after the heartbeat stopped but Halappanavar died of septicaemia on 28 October.

The way it works in Kraków is that there are many various places specializing in different kinds of music and thus attracting different clients and while they're often crowded, only one or two clubs where people go to show off actually have lines. Also you can find a party on every day of the week, so the people are more ""evenly distributed"".

On the other hand there are many places I don't go to and the ones I like are often too crowded on the weekend, so maybe you're right and the only reason for no lines is that there is a fuckload of places to party in this city.

Now I sit in my house in Texas and watch TF1, France 2, and France 3 all the live long day and I'm happy as the happiest motherfucking clam in the sea. It's the only thing that's consistently worked for me, I've tried many different routes. *Plus its free, yo.*

   If she decides to install XBMC, tell her to get the Navi-x add-on as well, because there are lots of live streams of tv channels from all over the world coming from many different sources (in other words, there are about ~10 different France 3 channels with some streaming from source A, others streaming from source B, and still others from source C). This way, if the France 3 live stream you're watching starts buffering a lot due to heavy traffic or stops working for whatever reason, there's a good chance you can find a different France 3 thats still online and streaming like a champ. It's just amazing. Lots of French movies too...

  Pluzz has sadly never worked for me. However, the TF1 Replay, Canal +, and M6 XBMC add-ons (where you can watch all the recently aired episodes on demand, like pluzz) all work flawlessly. 


  Basically, I've French-ified the hell out of my XBMC, and it's the coolest thing I've implemented in my life this decade. I've also installed it on my mom and dad's computers (both French living in the USA) and they're thrilled as well, so much so that they've since spread the word to their other French friends in town who've all joined the bandwagon and haven't looked back since. 


  I could go on, really, but I think this is *by far* the best way to gain access to French media (live tv+movies) from the USA. I'd spread the word to every French expat in this country if I could. If she decides to go the XBMC way and has any trouble at all getting it set up or finding the French stuff, I'd be more than happy to help... Just let me know!

But on the other hand also raised so that women should put the family first and career second, they should work, and have fulfilling work, but not sacrifice children and family and making a nice home for the sake of a promotion. I mostly agree with this. 

The combinations of culture and biology are complicated. Culture is not just random opinions, it is a set of complex causal relationships, based on objective economic  conditions and whatnot, and yes, there is something immoral in raising kids in a way that they will not function properly and happily in the world, because they are more gender-neutral than the realities and the expectations of others. ""Exploring opportunities"" sounds cool, but basically it boils down to ""freedom in the sense of autonomy"", and this is precisely that kind of liberalism that values autonomy over all other values that I disagree with.

The first known recipe for the modern cheese fondue under that name, with cheese and wine but no eggs, was published in 1875, and was already presented as a Swiss national dish.[8] Despite its modern associations with rustic mountain life, it was a town-dweller's dish from the lowlands of western, French-speaking, Switzerland: rich cheese like Gruyère was a valuable export item which peasants could not afford to eat.[9][10]

That wealthy elites judge [stealing a few cookies](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/jun/20/duncancampbell) to be a greater crime than stealing billions from an entire nation contains a clue to the origin of the illusion that poor people commit more crime.

Wealthy elites love the fairytale of dutiful &amp; subservient vs treacherous &amp; evil slaves/servants/inferior classes. Perhaps part of their paranoia about losing their privileged position. Similarly the 'scientific proof' that women can't concentrate/reason/vote as well as men.

You completely missed the point - my point was that stereotypes are rooted in truths about SUBSETS of certain groups, and then incorrectly overgeneralized over the whole. That the proper way to handle them is not to reject them but to refine them until they reflect actual truth.

Also, your ""wealthy elites argument"" is spectacularly wrong, it is based on the mirror opposite of the just world fallacy, the unjust world fallacy, that somehow evil people are more succesful. It is obviously not the case. This is why your whole worldview is completely wrong from even the whole starting point, because people react to what others do, so nice people do better than evil people because they get better reactions, meaning on the average more succesful or powerful people are actually better than the average people, meaning oppression doesn't explain shit. This blame the wealthy and powerful mentality is the bane of our world for centuries, and every kind of meaningful solution was only made when we managed to ignore all the intellectuals who spew this shit. In reality most rich kids are raised to be considerate and socially conscious, and the world is full of savage, sadistic poor kids.  We get much more rational by assuming a just world prima facie, where nice people rise and evil people fall, although  not taking it as a fact because that would be a fallacy (just world fallacy) and the carefully modifying the model it for the parts that are not just, for example, politics.

Prejudice doesn't need to be overcame, it needs to be made more precise and exact, sweeping generalizations over millions are actually a good first step as they are better than saying nothing, but they need to be improved so that one can pinpoint exactly what kinds of sub-sub-sub-groups and sub-sub-sub-cultures do that.",0,1352888791,null,0,1352888978,0,c716epf,t3_1323h2,t1_c716epf,t1_c716cds,null,1430402653,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Northern Ireland politics suffers from an unusual amount of church influence, The previous leader of the DUP's (the political party with the largest representation in local government) former leader, was the founder of a fundamentalist church, the Nationalist parties are no better in terms of religious interference with policy.

Northern Ireland is the backwards shithole of the UK, the political climate is polarised and is essentially built on a sectarian split, with Catholic voting Sinn Fein/SDLP, Unionists voting DUP/UUP and the more moderate voting for the Alliance party.

Over recent years the voting has shifted away from the more moderate UUP and SDLP towards the more extreme Sinn Fein and DUP, so in my opinion there is unlikey to be much progression in social liberties in the immediate future.

And **finally** I understand you. You must be that kind of young person who has a large number of friends and generally a large social circle and cares about being popular in it, and is scared of having opinions that are unpopular or seen as horribly wrong by them, because  it would result in being a social outcast. Thankfully, I am way too old for these games, my social life is more like helping uncle redoing the roof or something similarly mature and meaningful, thankfully I have little contact with the brainwashed fools I went to college with, so I can actually afford to think independently and critically.

I think we need to stop the discussion here because no only you don't have arguments, you are simply acting out your fears of social acceptance. For example I did not even mention discrimination, you mentioned it because it is a typical topic to be outraged about  in your social circles, to buy popularity with.  The standard liberal ""look at me how nice and caring I am"" method is basically shoehorning any different thinking into predefined categories of wrong, like, ""discrimination"", and condemning it publicly to score popularity points.

Mais pourquoi n'y avait-on pas pensé plus tôt !

Dans le même genre on trouve une perle :
&gt; Le paiement du solde sera assumé par les banques publiques qui peuvent se refinancer auprès de la BCE

Et comment on fait quand la BCE devient insolvable ? Vu la tête du [bilan de la BCE](http://www.les-crises.fr/bilan-bce/), je ne donne pas cher de ces petits papiers monnaie qu'on appelle euros. N'importe quel budget qui essaie de garder le fonctionnement de l'euro tel qu'il est ne sera qu'une rustine. Comme les allemands ne veulent pas changer le fonctionnement, il va falloir sortir de l'euro, dévaluer, et restreindre les mouvements de capitaux et de personnes aux frontières. Le problème c'est que les investissements étrangers vont diminuer alors qu'on en a bien besoin. 

Sinon, dans le programme, il n'y pas grand chose au niveau de la réforme de l'État (rationalisation des compétences territoriales, simplification des démarches, patriotisme dans les marchés publics), alors qu'il y a au moins 10 milliards à gagner immédiatement, voire 50 si on fait les choses à fond (le rapport de la cour des comptes 2012 est éloquent).

Rien non plus pour contrôler l'efficacité des dépenses publiques, alors qu'on propose leur augmentation à 49% du PIB.

Pour l'augmentation de l'investissement public, je veux bien, mais à qui donner l'argent ? Le Concorde, le nucléaire et Ariane se sont faits avec de l'investissement public ET des ingénieurs / gestionnaires de qualité dévoués à l'État. Aujourd'hui, la majorité des cadres n'accepte plus de travailler pour l'état quand le privé offre 30% de salaire en plus sur toute une carrière. Surtout quand parallèlement le FdG propose de supprimer les grandes écoles et l'ENA. Pour investir dans les énergies durables et les technologies de pointe, aujourd'hui, il faut former des gens et les payer autant que le privé.

Il y a tout de même de très bonnes idées pour changer de modèle de société, mais avec des effets de bord qui vont être compliqués à gérer dans un monde sans frontières.  

Par exemple, comment envisager le web actuel en mettant une taxe sur la publicité ?  La pub se fera à l'étranger, les sites aussi, et on se prive d'un secteur très innovant, sur lequel on pourrait être largement meilleurs.

Dans tous les cas, je ne vois pas de raison de ne pas donner plus de pouvoir à la cour des comptes :

But the real reason why Spain will run a trade surplus after many years of unemployment is that Spanish workers will simply be unable to afford to buy much.

The Pro-Iran croud in this case is the Syrian army, they fight for the Alawite Bashar al-Assad who is backed by the Iranians and the Russians. The simple fact is that it is known that the Saudi's (sponsors of islamic hardliners worldwide) are sending weapons into Syria in a bid to supplant the Alawite government (supported by local Christians) with a government based on a more orthodox interpretation of Islam. They do so with American support because the Americans aren't too fond of Russian influence in the middle east. This civil war has become a proxy war, it is a struggle for domination of the middle east because if Assad wins the Russians maintain their influence thus maintaining their two-pronged vice-grip on Turkey (an ally of the Americans). If Assad loses the Russians lose an ally in the middle east which in and of itself would be profit for the American camp.

This does not follow the previous statement. Minority rights are given based on ethnicity, not nationality, and they are internal matters of Romania. In external matters, people ask for your passport (i.e. your nationality), not your ethnicity. The German police does not care what ethnicity somebody is, they care about nationality, so they know where to deport your ass.

If you want to have that particular useful and adapted machine for your businesses, chances are its produced in some medium sized company in Germany.

Guess why Germany still has a trade surplus, and China as one of the main trading partners? One guess: it's not because German products are cheap.

Instead of countries blaming it on the German economy, people should try to find their own, economic successful, way. If your hair dressing business doesn't work out because there's a fucking good hairdresser in your street, then don't bloody try to compete and start to make some scissors.

Now what I think is correct is that the German government is being too restrictive in allowing growth within Germany. That might very well be a problem - and a good way of increasing spending while securing for future growth would be to pay off debt.

true,SuperLoutre,null,null,"Marseille is a very special city. It's one of the poorest town of France and it's historically a place of contestation, where the culture is shifted with the rest of the country.
(For exemple, there are an old fort in the entry of the port in the downtown. The cannon were not facing the sea to protect the city but facing the city to protect France against  marseillais.)

This situation creates an identity specific to the city of Marseille. Then, in the end of the video you can hear a young boy saying ""we are not french, we are marseillais, bande de batard"". This feeling is current among disadvantaged youth. (For exemple, Zinedine Zidane, a famous soccer player, at the question ""Do you feel more French or Algerian "" he says ""I feel  marseillais"" )

Some person of poor neighborhoods transform their characteristic of life (strong local cultural identity + poverty + street trouble) in positiv or involved message. (For exemple : Keny Arkana [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oewRadlyrHo) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqVe9-u9KEE&amp;feature=related) or IAM [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9labSkGICc) or [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uQ_X6nQ8xk) )

Unfortunately, some other boys  plunge into crime.

Marseille has a bad reputation. But it's a pretty city. The light, the see, the people, the way of life are great when you live here. In fact every body who come here become a true marseillais really quickly, and it's maybe for that in 2005, during riot in France, Marseille remains calm.

It's Germany and Austria that should be labelled as this.

If you want to attack the Balkans, you should focus more on Croatia, not Serbia.

It's Croatia that allied with Germany and tried to kill all the Serbs. It's Croatia that killed 700,000 people (mostly Serbs) in concentration camps. Don't expect Serbia to forget that easily.

And about the Yugoslav Wars, the Media was absolutely controlled by Milosevic, so the anti-Croatian and anti-Bosnian propaganda was enormous. 

When you listen to Serbian music, read Serbian history and poetry, you notice they are very deep and emotional people. Why do you stick with this stupid misconception? Has the propaganda really fucked that much with your brain?

Serbs love their country, they will defend it against unjustice.

Kosovo has always been part of Serbia, and IS in fact part of Serbia. Expect the Serbs to defend it.

 ""In my opinion you're acting like a [racist slur, don't know a good translation]... you've got no business being here... this is my country, you hear me?""

Zoran replied ""It's my country too""

""Ahh, my country... Not, it's not your country, it's my country."" Almqvist then hissed in Zorans ear.

Soran: ""Take it easy, it's like... I'm just making a point.""

Almqvist: ""Yeah, but you're making it like a cunt.""

A drunk man wanders up and tries to snatch the camera out of the SD-politicians hand. The three politicians then shove the man and say ""Learn Swedish! Speak Swedish for fucks sake!""

As the three are leaving a short while later, they again walk up to the man, shove him and say: ""Hey! Act like a Swede!"" The man replies ""What did I do? What does it mean that I'm just standing here?""

""It means you're being aggressive.""

Almqvist leans in and says something to the man, who then says the racist slur from earlier twice.

Almqvist turns to his friends, laughing, and says ""I love doing that just to fuck with them."" They all laugh. Amqvist: ""Don't you just love doing that just to fuck with them? It's not like I care anyway.""

A woman confronts them about the second incident, and asks them why they were ""hitting"" the man. Almqvist tells the other two ""Fuck this little whore! Fuck her!"" [as in, ""Ignore"", not literally].

This all happened at a McDonalds in central Stockholm early on a Wednesday morning.

It's worth pointing out that SD actually used footage from this video, heavily edited, a few years ago to make it appear as though they were being attacked by immigrants. Just yesterday one of the men who were there that night twittered about this all being lies.

They (Barcelona) has fought to defend Spanish freedom in the past.

The past does lead to the present and influences the future to some degree. Historical  claims, the constitution or vote by the entire country of Spain is enough to decide such matters. 
It should only be considered if the majority of all citizens in catalunia voted for independence. Otherwise no.

Countries like France wouldn't recognize or tolerate such things either.

&gt;Catalan culture and made speaking the Catalan language a crime

The could always speak their ""language"" it was never a crime.

&gt; This is a fair point, but it doesn't show the whole picture. Catalonia doesn't always get as much public spending going in as tax going out. 

It's actually Catalunia that has a deficit of debt with the rest of Spain. See this article **[¿Pacto fiscal? Cataluña tiene un superávit de 4.357 millones respecto a España](http://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/2012/11/06/pacto-fiscal-cataluna-tiene-un-superavit-de-4357-millones-respecto-a-espana-108669/)**

Translation:
How much brings Catalonia state funding and how much you receive in return? The question has caused rivers of ink, but the latest studies on the subject puts the record straight. **I signed Professor Ezequiel Uriel , the Valencian Institute of Economic Analysis (IVIE), and his conclusion is clear: it is false that Catalonia has a deficit with the rest of Spain equivalent to 16.409 million euros. Instead, he enjoyed in 2009, the last year analyzed, a surplus equivalent to 4,357,000 because of the 'solidarity' of other territories.**

Uriel's study is inspired from a longer work done together with Prof. Ramón Barberán and edited by the BBVA Foundation. And what conclusion is that ""the Government [Catalan] uses an inappropriate method to determine the amount of inter-regional solidarity gives preponderance of Catalonia and the dissemination of results to data that is not real . "" Thus, in 2009, instead of having a positive contribution to the inter-regional solidarity 16.409 million euros, Catalonia's contribution was negative for an amount of 4,357 million. To cover these costs, says Uriel, ""the state had to issue public debt. ""

&gt; According to your opinion - and I see no good reason why Catalan people should use your opinion, instead of their own, to define their feelings about their national identity.

Yes, when they check their passports and Catalunia is a region of Spain.

&gt; As it happens, I work in the Catalan education system, and so I can tell you first-hand that this is not even partially true. Spanish is very well-taught in Catalan schools, and Catalan students do as well as students from the rest of Spain on Spanish language exams.

Your response doesn't surpise me in that case. Mind: I'm not Spanish, not an expert on these issues, but I can view it from both sides and defend Spain's position on this matter that catalunia is Spain too.

Catalan used to be the primary languge of education in Catalunia to teach all subjects. This changed in 2011 when the Spanish Supreme court ruled that education must be optional Catalan-Spanish bilingualism until at least the age of 8 for students. Because many parents were discriminated against who wanted their child to be educated in Spanish too. That is fair. See:

Of course there are different branches of the German economy, but there is sufficient statistical evidence that Germany does not compete by means of low wage and low prices in most of its exports.

true,EatingCake,UNSA,United States of America,"Abortions are constitutionally protected in the US, so no matter what laws are passed they'll remain legal in the states - in *every* state. The presence of a ""few"" nations in Europe already puts Europe in the ""less progressive"" category, but it's more than that. 

Take one of your examples: Germany. A quote from Wikipedia:

&gt;A new law was passed by the Bundestag in 1992, permitting first-trimester abortions on demand, subject to counseling and a three-day waiting period, and permitting late-term abortions when the physical or psychological healh of the woman is seriously threatened. The law was quickly challenged in court by a number of individuals - including Chancellor Helmut Kohl - and the State of Bavaria. The Federal Constitutional Court issued a decision a year later maintaining its earlier decision that the constitution protected the fetus from the moment of conception, but stated that it is within the discretion of parliament not to punish abortion in the first trimester, providing that the woman had submitted to state-regulated counseling designed to discourage termination and protect unborn life.

That right there is worse than the worst laws passed by American pro-lifers. Abortions are, legally speaking, murder. The government can choose not to persecute them but it defines from a legal point of view, a clump of cells as a person, and goes to rather extreme lengths (waiting period? Seminars? The worst US conservatives have managed is a mandatory sonogram) to prevent abortions. 

So where abortions are allowed they are a legal gray area where rights can be stripped away at the whims of a small majority. In quite a few nations/microstates they're allowed only on the conditions of rape/health.

I've no idea, I only know that there are 20% more teachers in Hungary that there's capacity, so obviously they can go if they want. I'm not familiar with the situation in Spain, but I remember there's something like a 25% unemployment rate in the country, probably including aspiring teachers that are willing to work without a 13th salary. Maybe they would even be willing to take ""free"" training to improve their skills, thus becoming great teachers, without blackmailing an already troubled society into giving them money.

In economical history (Swift, Laffer) it's observable that the population begins to protest once the state reaches a primary surplus ratio of more than about 5% (meaning that the state takes 5% more in taxes than it gives back to the populus). This is apparently happening in your country.

You might think ""why does the state increase that number?"" I'll explain with a simplified equation. This is the condition to avert state bankruptcy.

(D / Y) =&lt; p * [(1+g)/(r-g)]

D/Y is the dept-GDP-ratio; p is the primary surplus ratio and the last part is growth of GDP interwoven with the interest on your debt. If both sides are equal, your debt will stay constant. If the left side overweighs you begin to increase debt and vice versa.

An easy example would be an economy with p=0,05, interest r=0,1 and a stable growth of 0. 

0,05 * (1+0) / (0,1-0) = 50%

In this scenario, a primary surplus ratio of 5% would be able to sustain an economy with up to 50% debt-GDP-ratio. Obviously this is skewed, but it's enough for demonstration purposes.

The EU mandatory maximum debt-GDP ratio is 60%. Portugal was at 108%, Italy 120% and Greece 165% in 2011. It's a hard truth that has to be accepted, these economies are no longer sustainable on their own. You might think ""of course they can, a state can always raise taxes"". 

They cannot. The populus will literally kill them, as your reaction has oh so aptly proven. Without significant help from outside, a radical reset of the economy or a great epiphany among the population, the state will fail.

Which brings me back to the start and I can't stress this enough: This *needs* to happen and people like you need to calm the fuck down, get politically active, seek out the facts and vote to your best ability. Frequent strikes only serve to harm your employer and the state even further. Every good economist already knows since 2008 that you'll be pissed.

On a last note, I don't have a clue how much your outrage about class warfare in your country concerning who takes the brunt of the force really is. I can only assume that the outrage is more personal than fact based and I could very well be wrong. If so I apologize.

1. They've never governed and most of their ideas are rhetoric and completely impractical e.g. 10e tax free minimum wage etc. They spout on and on about how there should never have been a bank bailout, but fail to provide practical solutions

2. Their ties to the paramilitary organisations they used to represent as their day job are still present, even if uncomfortable to address by their supporters. Martin Mcguinnes and Gerry Adams are known IRA members, with McG still unwilling to say when he ""left"" the IRA. 


3. When a group tells you everything will be perfect with no cost and no pain despite a global economic crisis *as long as you vote for them*, you're setting yourself up to be lied to.

true,BoratBoratBorat,EURO,European Union,"The problem is not the cuts its how and where they are being made. Only the working class and some SMEs are paying for the deficit. Big companies are mostly exempt from paying taxes, banks have a special regime that pay no taxes even though most of our deficit is due to money that government lent them. All of the wage cuts from 2010 to 2012 went to a bank that was nationalized (BPN - around 6000 million €, among the noteworthy clients were our President and parliament) and the gov. now sold it for 40 million€. If you are a private stock investor you pay 25% of your profits (dividends and/or sales), if you have a savings account you pay a 25% tax over your earned interests, if you're a stock management company, you pay nothing, so, now all our big companies are stock management companies to dodge taxes. Even two month ago, our government wanted to offer another tax break to companies at the expense of a 7% tax increase to workers.

Our electricity, gas and fuel is among the most expensive in the EU, the monopolistic company that provides it has stated record profits every year, including this one. Our rich are getting more rich by the day, have their money on tax heavens and only declare minimum wages. A worker that earns more than 80.000€ / year pays our maximum tax bracket - 52%. Even people that earns more than 7000€ /year will pay 14.5%.

Our Government refuses to negotiate or end PPPs that made in the past and are consuming more money than some ministries. It doesn't touch our famous foundations that are more than 800 and have only two purposes: tax evasion and money laundering, to add insult to injury they even receive government grants.

Official figures state the the parallel economy is around 25% of our GDP, some private sources says that is actually more around 40%, what is the government doing about that? Absolutely nothing. Most of our financial problems would be solved if the government was willing to fight the black markets.

This is my outrage and the outrage of many more. We don't have a financial problem, we have corruption problem, our Parliament is a business and corruption center, and I am paraphrasing our representative of the Transparency International. Never a case of corruption ended with a conviction. Our former PM was clearly implied in a case of bribery to allow the building of mall in a natural park, every witness said the guy accepted 2 million to allow the construction, there was recordings of his phone calls during the investigation that a judge deemed worthy of proof against him, our supreme court immediately ordered the destruction of those recordings and he wasn't even questioned.
