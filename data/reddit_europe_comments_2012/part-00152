No, we don't. Have you tried solving it in any other way? Are you sure that we are growing what the Europeans need for their *survival*. I am 100 % sure that many of the farmers are not growing what is optimal for suvival, but what they earn money on. For example, I hope they are not growing something useless, like tomatoes in France when it would be so much better to grow onions, or that we use energy and subsidies to desert areas in Spain - that is not the ultimate use of the money,that is not the optimal calorie content etc. And, they are most certainly not having the optimal protein sources, I think chicken is much better than beef.

This sounds like the whole EU is blaming the UK for opposing the budget.

But it is not like they are the only opposed to the budget.
[Germany shares the same oppionion](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/london-and-berlin-demand-billions-in-cuts-to-proposed-eu-budget-a-864560.html).
The article in [German](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/eu-haushalt-deutschland-lehnt-billionen-budget-ab-a-864432.html)
uses an even stronger headline with saying that Germany is blocking the budget.

Those article don't say where the German politicians wants further cuts. But seeing such a reaction from France and knowing that more than 40% of the budget is used for farming, it seems clear that they also want to cut the CAP.

They are still talking about the budget and I would like to acknowledge that the France position on it is not the position of Continental Europe.

And on a personal note I want to add that this is also one of those times I think the British participation to Europe is needed. 
They are needed to balance the French demands. Alone the German opposition of the budget is not enough to agree on a reasonable budget. Especially since I rate the diplomatic skills of the French much higher than the ones of their German counterparts. 
I think that it is highly possibly that France joins arms with some of the other members of ClubMed (maybe in return of a grow package they will vote for). 
Isolating Germany even more from their Eurozone partners. 


While you really seem to be well informed about Europe, I don't know your knowledge about the German post-war Psyche

We live in a world were global warming, peak oil and ever increasing demand are a reality. Climate change will accelerate the desertification of India and China (not to mention Africa being swallowed by the Sahara but they're not important) and significantly impact agricultural yields in the US (as the areas with the highest yields rely almost exclusively on rain, with very little irrigation infrastructure in place) Those three countries along with the (hypothetically no longer productive EU) make up more than 35% of the world's agricultural output. 

Can a diminished US and Brazil feed the world? Possibly, if a massive deforestation campaign is enacted in the latter, which would ironically contribute to the expansion of the already desertified Northeast as well as global warming. But, how do you transport all that food as oil becomes less and less abundant yet also much more difficult to extract? Renewable energy sources can power a country but not the super massive container ships that are common today—at least not easily or cheaply. Even if every country agrees to go the renewable way and oil was left for only the most important things like facilitating global trade, the price of shipping would still rise monstrously.  

And lets not even go into how modern agriculture is almost exclusively dependent on fertilizers that require immense amounts of energy to manufacture.

I'd ground myself in deontological ethics, specifically arguing that our capacity as moral beings coupled with the then (imo) necessity of universalisability instils a requirement for rights in humans as much as it does a requirement for food or for water.

&gt; Do you believe in the existance of human rights?

Enforcement of a right is not the same as the source for that right.

&gt;What is a right if one cannot exercise it?

It is denied. Quite simply.

&gt;Such as?

Well I'd argue that rights come from ability of the human race to reason. Universalisability is a good place to go from there. I won't hurt you because I wouldn't want you to hurt me. Recognising that our ability gives us a duty to each other not to use others as a means to an end - once that's in place a fairly simple framework of freedoms arises rapidly, what one can and can not do is judged by universalisability, and there you have it: morality. Rights just describe things you can do within this sytem, and I'd argue that yes, they are inherent not as a result of god given-ness or some quality of the universe, but rather as a quality of what *we* are.

&gt;The whole concept of a right is an invented one.

I disagree, as per the above.

&gt;There is no supernatural imposition of rights upon humanity.

I agree, as per the above.

By subsidizing agriculture, you're making it a much greater burden to society and you're making sure it's the taxpayers that will have to pay for the inefficiency of the farmers as these will have their products subsidized regardless of them being competitive or not.

&gt;On a larger, global level, the same logic can be applied to Europe, we do not want to get pressured into doing something because the Chinese won't sell us rice or the Americans their corn. 

This is an argument for protectionism. We had a lot of this here in Europe before the EEC and it was never any good for anyone - it promotes inefficiency and allows for trade wars and conflicts to escalate because it's much easier to do so if countries aren't interdependent. 

Also, it's not like it would be in China's interest to embargo us on rice of the USA on corn, nor would be these embargoes be that dangerous as they're not the only world suppliers of rice or corn.

Besides, even if China, the USA, Brazil, Africa and everybody else for some irrational reason decided not to sell us any of these agricultural goods, I'm sure it wouldn't take long before we ourselves started cultivating it and deny those other countries from their exportation profits and essentially make their embargo irrelevant.",0,1351765933,null,0,false,0,c6urtos,t3_12etph,t1_c6urtos,t1_c6ulfro,null,1430291591,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,arkiel,FRAN,France,"The strategic importance of being able to produce your own food is a given, and the likeliness of war doesn't even matter.

Here is one hell of a reason why not producing your food is very bad : if you don't produce it, you have to import it from somewhere. Now, that Somewhere's problems become your problems, because if they have problems you don't get your food. The problems between you and that Somewhere also become your problems, because it can affect your food supply.  
There is also the question of how that food is made. Somewhere is probably a less developed country than yours, because if it were as rich, it probably wouldn't be cheaper to grow it there and ship it here than to produce here. And you have to trust Somewhere with adhering to *your* standards of growing food, and if they don't do a very good job at it, people are going to be sick and die of food poisoning.

In Europe right now, war is probably the least of our concerns regarding food supply. But that's because we produce a lot of food, so we're cool. Imagine if we were importing even 10% of our food from, say, Iran, or any country from the region that Iran could easily strike in case of a conflict. How about Syria ?  
Sure, you can and should diversify your supply chain, but then you multiply the number of problems of other people that you can add to your own. For example, if we were importing most of our food from north africa and the middle east, consider the Arab Spring.

Finally, there is the fact that you can't just jump-start agricultural production with the snap of a finger. You need heavy machinery, people knowing how to grow stuff, land, seeds, animals, etc. So, if you want to be able to produce food in the future, which you definitively want if only for the reasons stated above (and those are only a few), you have to produce it now to conserve the capacity.

Nebeneinkünfte sind **nicht** Geschenke. Wenn jemand 25k€ dafür bezahlt, dass Herr Steinbrück einen Vortrag hält, dann ist das in meinen Augen zunächst nichts negatives, warum auch? Wenn er seine Abgeordnetentätigkeit stark vernachlässigt, ist das doch vollkommen unabhängig davon was er sonst macht. Ein fauler Abgeordneter der einfach lieber vor der Glotze hängt als zu abstimmungspflichtigen Sitzungen zu gehen ist mindestens genauso verachtenswert wie einer der stattdessen mit Nebeneinkünften Geld schaufelt, aber das ist ein vollkommen anderer Vorwurf der mit anderen Daten als ""1.250.000€!!!!!"" hinterlegt werden muss.",0,1351778499,null,0,false,0,c6uthon,t3_12g513,t1_c6uthon,t1_c6usf0g,null,1430292376,0,false,de,t5_22i0,0

There is obviously a risk in this, and it's not to be taken lightly, however it cannot be used as an excuse for an absolutist view of freedom of expression either since there are risks in both models.

However, there are plenty of checks and balances that can be made, and ultimately, if an idea is deemed unacceptable by a given community, why should they be forced to allow it, it may be in a specific case there is a good reason, but that's for them to decide so long as they are not harming anyone with it (and if they are, it's the harm, not the speech restriction, that is the issue)?

Actually, I think the city of Amsterdam is making *precisely* this calculation we're talking about: tourists coming (mainly) for weed don't bring much money, but they bring *some* money, and they're a large group, so you don't want to alienate them *entirely*, and all in one go. I suspect that the long-term goal of Amsterdam is to gradually phase out the low-key type of tourism linked to drug tourism, while trying to attract higher-income tourists at the same time.

Well, okay, there is hate but that is from stupid people you can safely ignore. 

Germany has always been seen as the overconfident, sometimes bullying guy up north by many Swiss (no comment on whether this is justified or not, just explaining). Remember that a large part of our character is anti-authority/power/prominence in many ways that weird out foreigners and are often totally irrational and contradictory.  Germany is viewed as much more hierarchical and coldly rational (plus you guys talk a LOT) than many Swiss are comfortable with. 

Also realize that we learn Hochdeutsch in school - and proper German is considered the measure by which someone's communication is judged.  So even a highly educated Swiss is likely to have this goofy country bumpkin accent compared to even some German Schnoesel.  Germans also seem to learn to be much more confident and direct, and for example to place more emphasis on titles and hierarchy, so you can imagine where the discomfort comes from. 

Unfortunately even if you are a really nice guy, the language means that a lot of people will just have this instinctive ""ugh, Germans again"" reaction.  Sorry.

Edit : for the haters, I'm not an economics professor, but I do understand the basics of supply and demand : 

there's a high demand for weed all around Europe and many countries (cannabis is the most used ""illicit"" drug, and even if you don't smoke it yourself, if there's 5% of many countries that ask for it, that represents a Huge demand, go look at the numbers if you don't believe me)

Since the only supply to that demand is illegal bad quality/cut products, except for the one place located in the center of the EU, it will attract a lot of people.

If you just want to ""replace"" that canna tourism by anything else, you'd have to find something that is as highly demanded as that ""illegal drug"" as they call it (I name it like it is, a dried flower, not unlike many herbs/spices in your kitchen)

And if there was anything that's more demanded than this, you'd be able to find it in your country, like anything else you buy.

It's not the location of the netherlands only, it's about the politics of other countries making cannabis a very rare and hard to obtain (i'm talking about quality here, you can get some random laced ""stuff"" at your local dealer) 
But when you're trying to avoid getting toxic products, when you're worried that you're gonna get busted/lose your license/sent to jail or prison just for it, then you go to amstedam.

And for the ""tourists are evil, they throw up everywhere, they are disrespectful,..."" you're stereotyping, there are some good, there are some bad, there are some aweful people out there. It's just that you'll tend to notice and be shocked by a rude/drunk tourist, but you'll never acknoledge the respectful, nice and just here to enjoy the place and what it has to offer, because he is minding his own business.

I went once to amsterdam, arrived at 5 in the morning, parked, had a coffee, was treated like shit by an amsterdamer whom I just asked what are some nice things to see in the city, came back to my car to find that my window was broken and someone emptied the car (not much but an old camera and my papers, a bag of clothes, and all got stolen). went to report to the police, they could not do much, but they were nice enough to give me an evidence bag to put in place of my window I left the city at 8, doing nothing that I wanted to do. didn't visit anything, didn't go to a coffee shop (except a real bar to just get a coffee before getting my well deserved vacation, which I never got.) Between the gas, payroads, window replacement, and what was in the car, I lost a lot in 3 hours.
What do I make of this trip ? that all amsterdamers are thiefs and racists against anyone who is not from there ? that there are a lot of tourists that are druggies and that needed to get into my car ? No, Because everywhere you'll go, there will always be a moron there to make you think bad things about a certain type of people =&gt; Never stereotype any country, people, religion, or anything. There will always be a bad apple, and you're 10 times more likely to see it and remember it, just get past it and go find the good ones !

Still, I wish I could have respectfully enjoyed the city for a few days, bought things and entrances to places, giving back to the local economy. But as many people, now short on money, and I can't get enough to go back and try to have my stolen trip..

It was just weird moving there. In Germany you have this impression of these nice people living up there between a mountain of cheese and a mountain of cash. (This impression is, I think, part of the reason for the resentment.) Then you move there, integrate, and you figure: ""Wow, they really don't like us at all"". Now places like Basel and Zurich are overrun by Germans, that probably doesn't help either. (Although I think economically Switzerland profits from that as well.)

Regarding the hierarchies, and this might have changed over the last decade, but I remember when the position you had in at least some large companies was also tied to the rank you had in the military. (And boy, do Swiss talk about it :) It's like the weather here in Canada. The go-to subject of any water cooler :))

But yes, you are right that Swiss are more subtle in their communication and less out there to get confrontational. More polite, and I think learning that helped me a lot in understanding the anglo culture as well.

Also, football? You have hockey! 80 million people and none of them can hold a stick right.

Saying they shouldn't have a referendum because they'd choose the 'wrong' option is an argument against democracy.

The EU isn't about keeping people in against their own will. If they do want to leave, fine, let them, just because the rest of us and specially them might end up worse off in the long run, we can't choose for them and deny them the right of re-evaluating their relationship with the EU. The Brits are more than capable and responsible enough to choose for themselves, what are you afraid of?

The referendum needs to happen, the worst case scenario would be them choosing 'NO' when asked if they want to continue within the EU but it would be mostly their loss and the rest of us would be able to proceed with European integration without them always threatening to veto. Though I personally think that they wouldn't vote 'NO' simply because it would be very harmful to their business interests, and so the referendum would be great as it would once and for all settle their issues with the EU and we'd be able to get much more done without them lashing out on anything that comes out of Brussels.",0,1351786104,null,0,false,0,c6uv9y0,t3_12gd10,t1_c6uv9y0,t1_c6uu1yk,null,1430293225,17,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,17

However, that is not *at all* what the CAP is about. If you look into the CAP, and the necessity for Europe to produce its own food in case of ""emergencies"" of some sort, I'd say that the CAP is actually working against it. 

For example - shouldn't we then stop giving aid to for example wine? Is wine a necessity? And, if we look at what is necessary to suvive, we should focus more on the calories - start planting onions and cabbage on the wine yards, use far less cows (the demand to much energy), and actually stop protecting the little farmer? Also, why are we supporting some parts of southern Europe? Do you know how inefficient it is from a water/energy point to grow some stuff there? So, if we need to keep some capacity  - maybe we should focus on that, but we do not. What part of the CAP actually does that?

First, let's think about it rationally. Would a politician ever say his party is not ready to govern, even if he believed it deep down? What he would do is, he would raise the issue internally.

But enough hypotheticals, [here's the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=r6zX86lLlUc#t=145s).

The ""We are not ready to govern"" statement is taken out of context. Lafazanis is talking about the fact that the country's situation is extremely difficult and if anyone said that he's ready to govern and solve all the problems in this situation, then he would be lying. 

The quote is an answer to the pressing and suggestive questions ""Is Syriza ready to govern"" that he's constantly being asked. Here is a translation of the answer:

&gt; All right. So be it. We are not ready to govern. I'm not going to give false hope to people. We have, however, made some major strides and we have reached a good state of preparedness. Parties come out and claim ""We are ready to govern and solve all the problems"" all the time. But then, after they win the elections and have to actually deliver, it's chaos. Isn't this what happened when Mr. Papandreou was saying ""There's still money"" and ""We have a 100-day programme"" ? Look, the problems are difficult. Our votes have jumped from 4% to 27% and we are now the main opposition party and perhaps in the near future, if the people will it, we will also govern. We have made an effort to look at things as realistically as possible, to see their essence and based on the real situation to create our policy programme. I think that because we have a conscious understanding of the problems and the hardships, what we have done so far is enough as a beginning for a government policy that will slowly but surely pay off.

By the way, Lafazanis has also made an announcement claiming that his quote was taken out of context.

Right now, we have a country in Europe that can produce a lot of food. That's France, but I read somewhere else in the thread that Poland's share in the CAP is rising, so that would be two big producers in the future. If we conserve this strength, we have food security for the foreseeable future. That means paying now (and later, too, of course).  
If we lose that capacity by outsourcing our food production, we will lose much more than just the amount of trade. We'll lose the expertise, the land use (if it's not farmed anymore, we can build stuff on it, or it will be pretty much abandonned), the machinery, etc. You can't rebuild those easily in the short term, so once you start outsourcing, and there's no predicting how far it is going to go, you can't go back without a massive investment, and even then it's going to take a long time.

And diversifying your sources will also multiply the problems that become yours. And what about the day when someone, say China, comes along and is willing to pay more than you for that same food you want ? As westerners, we're not used to think about that side of the problem, but with the rise of other powers on the world stage and our own decline, it's going to happen sooner or later.  
If we grow food in the EU, we can somewhat control how it's grown and where it goes. That's pretty important.


With the CAP, we're buying food security for the entire EU, and the importance of that cannot be over-emphasized. We cannot outsource food production without expecting massive problems down the line.

See how he manipulated the data? Citizens' vote was given less weight, in any case. The ""1 in 6"" scenario in this district, for both citizens and policemen, remains the most likely. Yes, a teacher is more likely to have voted for SYRIZA, and a policeman is more likely to have voted for GD (the average GD percentage among policemen in this district is more than 40% above the national average), but the ""1 in 2"" case is absurd.

On a final note, it's not worth it to give any credit to Lambropoulos (the journalist), he writes whatever he's told. He does things like that all the time.

*Note: GD's average percentage among citizens in nearby stations is higher (GD was the first party in polling stations 860 and 862). Lambropoulos' article was published after May's elections. If we substitute 16,83% (June 2012, I used this because I pasted from an earlier spreadsheet on a different computer) with 18,61% (May 2012), GD's percentage among policemen is lower than 9,95%. In another scenario, where 100% of the policemen in these 11 polling stations voted, 100% of absentees were citizens, and citizens that voted followed the same pattern as the one found in other nearby stations (GD average 18,61%), GD's percentage among policemen in ""the"" 11 would range from 20,90% (No. 812) to 29,95% (No. 811).

Pfff worrr... C'est pour cette question que j'ai mis autant de temps à te répondre. J'avoue que ça m'a un peu surpris. Mais je pense que la réponse est assez simple: C'est une theorie d'un système politique comme un autre, que comme toutes théories elle possède des experiences au moins partielles qui la soutiennent. Experiences comme celle de la vie de tous les jours quand on va au marché ou à plus grand échelle quand on regarde le bonheur, le taux de chômage, la pauvreté, la qualité des vidéos de chats de chaques pays.

&gt;Pour être honnête, ça me fait penser aux communistes qui disent que le communisme est le meilleur système possible et que l'URSS, la Chine ou Cuba ne sont pas de vrais communismes.

Bon déjà, ils ont raisons hein! On peux pas contester que ce n'était pas totalement dans leurs idéaux. Reste que cela constitue des expériences qui soutiennent ou non la théorie d'un Etat communiste.

Après y a la question de qu'est ce qu'elle est cette théorie? L'Etat communiste est l'Etat où on est le plus heureux?__ Qu'est ce que le bonheur__ un Etat communiste voit le bonheur dans l'égalité (me semble)__ Assure t'il cela? apparemment difficilement. Y a un élite qui domine.__ Qu'elles sont les causes de cette domination?__ Là je sais pas faut creuser, je m'y connais pas assez ;)

En fait je suis en train d'essayer de t'expliquer ce qu'est la politique (très mal certes, mais je crois tu aura compris que je ne suis pas le dieu du débat hein et de l'expression). Et que quand tu me dis que je pars d'assertion fausse, je te dis que c'est exactement pareil pour quasiment tous les programmes politiques français de ces dernières années. (y compris celui du front de gauche).

Ca se débat certes. Mais la comparaison que tu viens de faire c'est ça hein! Toutes les politiques que ce soit la tienne ou la mienne ont des asomptions sur les comportements individuelles. Ces derniers sont quasiment imprévisibles.

Non non. Ne pas confondre corrélation et causalité. La démocratie est encore toute jeune, faut lui laisser le temps de s'installer.
(Et encore une fois, je ne parle pas d'absence totale d'Etat)

En tous cas je maintient fermement que le libéralisme aide au maintien de la paix. Preuve récente en est que le Japon et la Chine sont à la limite de la guerre mais qu'ils ne se la déclareront jamais pour des raisons économiques :)

D'ailleurs maintenant que tu le dit si, il y a eu dans l'histoire absence d'état et paix réunis. Toutes ces confédérations de marchands qui ont échangé quelques soit leur pays ou leurs origines, qui ont fait des accords et des lois économiques sans besoins d'aucun Etat ni d'aucune milices... simplement la réputation de tel ou tel marchand l'obligeait à respecter certaines règles.

Mais, et les mecs qui paient tout ça, ils ont en vraiment envie de sa nouvelle idée?

&gt;si on enlève les restrictions sur l'emploi, d'après toi le nom des petites boites deviendrait plus attractif sur un CV ?

Determining if Scotland does or does not want to leave the UK is the point of the referendum surely?

The electoral system for the Scottish Government was designed to try and prevent any one party from having a majority. That the pro-independence party have achieved a majority despite that, and were thus able to start the referendum process, does indicate they have support.

It would also be more correct to describe the Scottish Government as Scotland's devolved government.

The democracy is defined by the constitution, but who defends the constitution? Who stops the president from proclaiming himself a dictator? It may be far-fetched for modern European democracies to think about, but is an mechanism which has to be in place.

It's basically just about checks and balances. The military has to fear the people as much as the politicians and judicial system. The Turkish military has defended the Republic many times and Turkey is no military dictatorship. The generals have ceded the power back to the elected leaders. The military seem to take their role as civic duty.

If the military is conscripted by the people, it is a function of the people.

I am not saying that this is ideal, but it has worked for Turkey. In my country, the king is supposed to defend the constitution and he is the leader of the armed forces and the church. That is principally not any worse than what Turkey has as a setup now.

The purpose is to keep an agricultural production capability. Not an emergency capability, a real one, where we feed ourselves pretty well without having to rely on outside help. For that we need to keep actively farmed land, know-how in the form of people who actually know what the fuck they're doing on a farm, and heavy machinery. You can't do that with onions, because no one gives a shit about onions.  
What are you going to do with your onions, who's going to buy them while there is everything else ? And if you don't produce enough to be able to feed everyone in Europe, your plan is worthless because you won't be able to meaningfully increase production by orders of magnitude in any useful time scale should the need arise.  
So, you need to produce a massive amount of onions and other stuff that no one wants in anything close to the quantities you need to produce to keep your agricultural capacity intact, and then what, do they go to waste ? So much for efficiency.  
Yes, we aid wine producers. But the land they use and their machinery could be used for other purposes should the need arise. Once the land isn't farmed anymore, it's going to be built up, or abandoned, and then you can't easily kick it back into production. Even worse if you don't have the machinery or the people knowing how to use it.

Again, the problem with your thinking is that you're thinking of emergencies, when the CAP is here so that we *never* get to the point where our food supply is being threatened. If we produce a lot of food inside Europe, then we have control over it. That means a lot. It means we don't risk a famine because a war broke out in Dumbfuckistan again. It means no one is going to out-bid us on the food we wanted to buy.

If we control the biggest part of our food supply, we're cool for the foreseeable future on this front. If we start outsourcing it like we did with industries, there is no way to tell where it's going to go, when it's going to stop or how. And losing control on the food supply is one of the worst thing that can happen to a society.

Whoever controls our food supply controls us. I'm not saying the CAP is efficient, or perfect. However, we have a vital need to control our food supply and that means keeping production home.

For that we need to keep actively farmed land, know-how in the form of people who actually know what the fuck they're doing on a farm, and heavy machinery.

We are still not doing that. Why are we supporting wine yards for God's sake. And, to keep farm land, we could do it much more easily if we didn't insist on small farms for example. If all we want is the ability, we should certainly concentrate on effectiveness, which we are not doing.


If we want to keep the capacity - why are we then for example keeping a capacity in parts southern Europe that soon will turn into desert land anyway - that is enormously inefficient?

Or, if we want the capacity - why do we aid the growing of flowers and super energy demanding food, like tomatoes in some areas? 

No, if all you want to do is to keep the capacity, the CAP is not even doing a good job of that.
&gt;So, you need to produce a massive amount of onions and other stuff that no one wants in anything close to the quantities you need to produce to keep your agricultural capacity intact, and then what, do they go to waste

I suggested onions (or potatoes for that matter) since they are easy to store, and grow in a lot of places, rich in nutritient etc.

They are also very good stable foods if this scenario is happening, which you suggests:

&gt;It means we don't risk a famine because a war broke out in Dumbfuckistan again. It means no one is going to out-bid us on the food we wanted to buy.


Right now, if you are going to feed me if a war broke out, I will, among other things, eat tulips and wine. Good choice, I'd rather go with my onions. 

So, the CAP is not even good at being efficient and/or keeping our foodsupply. I am Swedish, we had a more competible and efficient agricultural industry before we joined the EU. Why is the CAP against us being effective? That goes against eveything you said as well - keeping our food supply. We need to be effective to do that.And, nowhere, ever, do we need to spend 44 % of the budget on CAP.

true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"Ne t'inquiète pas s'il te faut deux semaines pour répondre, je préfère une réponse réfléchie à une réponse hâtive. 

Il y a quand même différents niveaux de crédibilité dans les théories politiques. Comme tu le pointes, on part d'assertions, et on en déduit des caractéristiques du système. On peut être en désaccord sur deux trucs : les assertions ou les déductions. Sur les assertions, on peut démontrer les erreurs en trouvant des contre-exemples réels. Si je dis que tous les humains sont spontanément généreux avec les inconnus, tu peux me trouver des contre-exemples réels pour me montrer que cette assertion est fausse au moins dans certains cas. 

Sur les déduction, là, on est dans le pur domaine de la logique. Il s'agit de montrer que les assertions choisies ne mènent pas à la conclusion proposée. Et je pense que quand tu affirmes que le libéralisme pur ne mène ni à la création de monopoles inamovibles ni à la concentration de capital, tu es dans ce genre d'erreur. Un modèle pur, théorique, où on autorise le prêt à crédit ou la location d'outils de production amène à une concentration de capital et à un revenu issu du capital en compétition avec les revenus du travail. J'ai conscience que ça sonne comme de la prose marxiste, mais ce sont à mon sens des concepts économiques neutres. Qu'en penses tu ? 

Après, on est d'accord que les théories politiques réelles partent d'hypothèses approximatives et de déductions pas super rigoureuses. C'est pas une science exacte, mais expérimentalement, on a des expériences qu'on peut utiliser. Et comparer des stats de différents pays, même si c'est pas une méthode parfaite, c'est probablement une des meilleures dont on dispose.

Quelle métrique veux tu utiliser ? Le PIB/habitant ? Le PIB/habitant en *purchase parity* ? L'index de développement humain ? Le degré d'éducation moyen ? l'espérance de vie ? Aucun de ces critères ne met clairement en tête les économies libérales plutôt que les nations plus ""socialistes"". En fait, les pays scandinave sont souvent dans le peloton de tête (le pétrole de la Norvège ou des US joue à mon avis un plus grand rôle sur le PIB que le système politique). À un moment, je m'étais dit que gagner beaucoup d'argent ne m'intéressait pas tellement, tant que je pouvais vivre assez bien dans le pays où je me trouve, bénéficier d'une bonne espérance de vie, et être au sein d'une population bien éduquée. J'ai donc pris l'indice de développement humain et supprimé l'influence du PIB. Étonnant de voir Cuba passer devant les US dans ce cas. Bon, j'avoue que depuis je cherche un critère qui reflète aussi les libertés individuelles car je ne me vois pas vivre dans un pays où on ne peut pas dire du mal du dirigeant.

J'ai donné le communisme en exemple, mais je ne suis pas particulièrement communiste, je ne suis pas anti-libéral, je ne vois simplement pas pourquoi on refuse de reconnaître les avantages et défauts respectifs de ces deux systèmes et qu'à la place on préfère les encenser et les mettre sur un piédestal en supposant qu'ils marcheront si on les utilise assez brutalement. Le communisme a quelques succès à son actif : les systèmes de santé y sont généralement bons. L'industrialisation planifiée de l'URSS a été faite en un temps record. Et le libéralisme a plein d'exemples de succès que tu connais bien, mais également d'échecs : dés qu'il faut se mettre d'accord sur un standard, par exemple, la compétition ça ne marche pas. 

Je ne parle pas de théorie là, mais de pratique. Ce défaut se retrouve dans la gabegie du système de santé américain, dans les multiples standards de téléphonie, de stockage de données, etc... Et on a pas mal d'exemple dans lesquels le standard le meilleur techniquement n'est pas celui qui a ""gagné"" (sauf bien sur à poser que le meilleur standard c'est forcément celui qui émerge, ce qui est un raisonnement circulaire)

Mon opinion actuelle est que dés qu'il y a besoin d'innovation, la compétition est le meilleur moyen de progresser, mais que quand il s'agit de construire une infrastructure dans un pays ""en retard"" et donc que le chemin à prendre est connu, la planification centrale est un raccourci considérable.",0,1351810916,null,0,false,0,c6v1t8e,t3_11r1b1,t1_c6v1t8e,t1_c6uxiad,null,1430296458,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

The number is determined partially by population. It's the state's number of congressional districts +2 for each Senator. This means that Wyoming's worth in the electoral college is a lot more, relative to its size, than California, which gets screwed the most.

&gt;If there is a tie, the House of Representatives (one of the two houses of Congress) elects the President, but the other party's vice presidential candidate becomes the Vice President.

Not quite. The House elects the President, but the Senate elects the Vice-President. The reason you're hearing that President Romney and Vice-President Biden is possible is because the Republicans will likely keep the House and the Democrats will likely keep the Senate, thus each would vote for their party's guy.

&gt;By custom, each state awards all of its electoral votes to the winner of its local popular vote. So, if Obama wins Ohio 50-45 (with 5% going to minor parties), he'll get 100% of Ohio's 18 electoral votes. However, the states are not bound by their respective popular votes, leaving open the possibility that a state might ignore the people's choice.

Nebraska and Maine are the only two states that do not give all of their electoral votes to the winner. They allocate them based on the popular vote. If Obama gets 75% of the vote in Maine, then he gets 3 out of the 4 votes.

&gt;Although the popular vote is split roughly evenly between Romney and Obama, the electoral vote greatly favors Obama.

Right. Though it should be noted that the electoral college in general favors the Republican Party, due to the fact that most of the small states are red, and their weight in inflated greatly by the addition of 2 senators to their electoral votes.


It is *possible* for there to be a repeat of 2000, where one man wins the popular vote and the other the electoral college. Romney would be more likely to win the popular vote due to higher voter turnout in red states and suppressed voter turnout in the blue states. 

One of my favorite facts about the electoral college is that it is technically possible for someone to be elected President with just 11 votes. If 1 person in each of the 11 most populous states voted for the same person, that person would become president, having secured enough electoral votes, even if tens of millions of people in the other 39 states vote for the other guy.",0,1351818195,null,0,1351819312,0,c6v3ms9,t3_12hfs9,t1_c6v3ms9,t1_c6v2xqs,null,1430297305,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16

That's cause to have deputies, you need majority votes in a certain territory (each deputy is appointed to a territory). The far left won more territories, but on the national level had fewer votes.

Therefore, cannabis will no longer be freely available, but you'll still see tourists come in droves looking for it, and those tourists will buy it off the street, and then you have a growing black market for cannabis in Amsterdam. That could harm their image even further than it is now.

I've been to Amsterdam twice now and I didn't smoke. It's a lovely city; you've got the canals, you can cycle *everywhere*, there's fantastic architecture, there's the Van Gogh museum, c'mon, there's plenty of things. And a nice thing I noticed as a non-smoking tourist was that the cannabis sub-culture thing wasn't noticeable in a bad way. Coffee shops weren't ostentatiously advertised. There were all the cannabis-featured T-shirts, of course, but I'm not sure I'd count that (I've seen plenty of similar things in London).

If what I described in my first paragraph happens, tourists that are *not* interested in drugs may be turned off by a suddenly increased presence of drug dealers, high people on the street, a smell of marijuana pervading the city even outwith coffee shops. That means you could try to stop drug tourism, but inadvertently damage tourism all around and also enable a much less pleasant drug market.

true,chaetodon,NETH,The Netherlands,"The consequences of a single curency are indeed not to be underestimated. I'm quite sure that of the architects of the euro, Kohl and Mitterand have thought it through and deemed 'no more war' via integration, starting with a single currency, to be the best model to achieve that end.
Btw your remark about bloc voting suggests that the diplomatic strategy of the UK has been in the past to play countries on the continent against each other so no bloc against the UK could be formed. This strategy is correct if the UK wants to keep going at it alone, but with support from a common market. There is however one problem with this strategy: it all hinges on the playing off of each other of the other countries. 
However, from this time forward the countries in the eurogroup can no longer gain substantial benefits from partnering with the UK, compared to partnering with other eurogroup countries. Furthermore: why should a major country outside the EU (like the BRIC countries or the USA) partner with the UK compared to partnering with the EU as a whole and having easy market access to a bloc of almost 500 million people? Whoops: UK diplomatic strategy dead. 
What we see a lot on this list from the UK side is a lot of dithering and insecurity about how to proceed. The UK simply is too large and economically important (the City) an entity compared to e.g. Norway that it can continue to allow itself to dissociate itself from the rest of the continent. The UK faces an important choice: start integrating further into the EU and be able to still use its soft power to influence decisions, or leave the EU, after which the financial centre of Europe will not longer be London and the British economy will be even further in shambles than now. 
You may think that London can remain important as a financial centre if the UK were not longer to be part of the EU, but know this: there is no chance in hell that the eurocountries will allow the primary currency market for the euro to be outside the EU. The further consequences for London (and the UK), if that scenario were to take place, would be just as inevitable as the current integration of eurocountries which was caused by the creation of the euro.",0,1351837413,null,0,1351838152,0,c6v7twf,t3_12gg87,t1_c6v7twf,t1_c6v3z0v,null,1430299344,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I thought you meant a fiscal union like the US or Australia, where the currency issuer both levies taxes and covers welfare/stimulus. This is a workable model.

Further restricting government spending whilst not offering new stimulus options can only worsen this and future crisises. If the central body were offering stimulus, ie a [job guarantee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_guarantee), we'd be out of the woods. Otherwise it's just more widespread unemployment causing immense damage to nations, and economies like house-of-cards that will fall over whenever the world sneezes.

There's nothing in the European Fiscal Compact that I can see that will prevent further crisises. It's built on the same flawed assumption, that economies are self-regulating things that will naturally run at full employment at all times, and that governments should be run like businesses. That is an absurd assumption leading to an even more absurd constraint.

It assumes that private demand for credit will at all times exceed potential for growth, and as such that the ECB will never have a problem keeping employment high. A proposition we know to be ridiculous - just look at Japan for the past decade, even with zero percent interest rates it's been unable to incite lending.

true,yannickmahe,FRAN,France,"I had a check. Here is the list of EU countries with ""flawed democracy"" (none are lower), and a quick explanation as to why.

The democracy index ranks countries on an overall score based on 5 criterias :

* Electoral process and pluralism 
* Functioning of government
* Political participation
* Political culture 
* Civil liberties
These ranks are calculated based on 60 criterias on a country. The evaluation given are described as ""Expert assessments"".

All EU countries get a score above 9 in ""Electoral process and pluralism"" and above 8.5 ""Civil liberties"", so that's not the issue.

Score is given from 1 to 10, 10 being the highest. If the overall score is below 8, the country is considered a Flawed Democracy. Above 8 is a ""Full democracy"". Below 6 is a Hybrid regime (think Hong Kong or Singapore) and below 4 is an authoritarian regime (China, DPRK).

Ranked from least flawed to most flawed :

* Portugal, overall score **7.81**. Low score in ""Political participation"" (6.11)
* France, **7.77**. Low score in ""Political participation"" (6.11)
* Slovenia, **7.76**. but 6.25 in ""Political culture""
* Italy,  **7.74**. 6.43 in ""Functioning of government""
* Greece, **7.65**. 5.71 in ""Functioning of government""
* Estonia, **7.61**. Low score in ""Political participation"" (5.00)
* Slovakia, **7.35**. 5.00 in political culture, 5.56 in political participation
* Cyprus, **7.29** - 6.11 in political culture, 5.63 in political culture.
* Lithuania, **7.24** low in functioning of govt (5.71) and political participation (5.56)
* Poland, **7.12** low in political participation (5.00) and political culture (6.25)
* Latvia, **7.05**, low in functioning of govt (5.36), political participation (5.56) and political culture (5.63)
* Hungary, **7.04**, very low in political participation (4.44)
* Bulgaria, **6.78** very low in political culture (4.38).
* Romania, **6.54** very low in political culture (4.38) and political participation (4.44)


Basically, EU citizens all live in countries with good civil liberties and free and fair elections. The issues are in political participation (in a lot of countries, people don't care about the elections), functioning of government (corruption, inefficiencies), and political culture (which is mainly in former eastern block countries where it is understandable).

Highest overall score : Norway, 9.8. (fun fact: Norway is not a real country. It is a political ploy to make you feel like something better would be possible).

As someone who spends a LOT of time in the US, this is not strictly speaking true.

The Democrats in the US have a crazy regulation fetish which FAR exceeds what I suspect the Finnish Social Democratic party would find reasonable. I think it has to do with the fact that the Democrats in the US haven't historically had enough power to realize how badly red tape can kill things. The amount of red tape I have to deal with in the US actually often *far exceeds* the amounts dealt with in Europe.

The biggest problem with Democrats is that they still embrace the true-to-America hubris, possibly even more so than Republicans if in a far more subtle way. Democrats might refer to European success in places like the Nordics, **but know fuck all about it**. I've heard more democrats (in RL and on reddit) refer to the Nordic countries as socialist than any other group, certainly more than republicans.

Given 100% of the senate and congress, I suspect the democrats might actually run the US in a very similar fashion to the average main stream left party in Europe, except they would probably still refuse to learn from mistakes of those that have gone before.


That being said, I'd still vote Democrat in the US, but they have significant problems and a part of those manifests in using what I'd consider ""left"" solutions, which is the height of idiocy.

**Fahsion:**
I'm not sure what country you're comparing Germany to so pointing out fashion is useless. I'm not sure how you dress or if you've ever been to another country, but Germans (and Europeans in general) are usually dressed nicely. Especially males stick out. I was part of an exchange program (University) and I was the only male who had any kind of accessory when it came to clothing. Be it a scarf or anything. My American friends in Germany like German fashion as well. Of course, not everybody is dressed up nicely but you'll find that anywhere. I've also lived in Paris, France, for a year and a half and the French wear similar clothes. It would be helpful if you could pin it down a bit. Are people not wearing what you personally like, what country are you comparing Germany to?

**New systems:**
If there was a good use for QR codes, people would use them. Germans used to be very, very careful in terms of privacy and to ""leaving everything as is"", but if they feel like they get a good use out of change, they'll change things up. That's why the privacy-cautious Germans are all on Facebook these days.

**Music Downloads / Streaming:**
We have Rdio, we have Spotify, Napster and a couple of others. The reason YouTube blocks music has everything to do with GEMA and I'm not sure how they'd reinforce the idea of old being always good. Just because many people in the US are religious doesn't mean that the US isn't achieving great things in the science department. The music industry in Germany is crippled by the GEMA, but there are similar things in other countries that cripple a certain industry there as well.

Note that I'm not a born Amsterdammer, or even born in the NL. Just moved here a few years ago. There are two things I want to mention that are perhaps the most important aspects in my mind: 

1. the drug tourists, or in general, the coffee shop audience, doesn't actually bother me much on a day to day basis. Neither do they bother most of the rest of Amsterdam, except maybe the residents right around the big entertainment areas (Leidseplein, etc). Most of the city only has the odd coffee shop between regular bars, and there is zero impact IMO on the surrounding. The exception is the inner city, the area aroudn dam square, the red light district, Leidseplein and Rembrandplein, where the combination of several coffee shops, regular bars that serve alcohol and are mainly frequented by tourists, and lots of fast food make for a depressing surrounding, if you're not out to get hammered yourself. Which leads me to my next point:

2. I'm aware that each city I know has it's ""to be avoided"" spots. Full of tourists, trashy food places and bars, places that are just stressfull and tacky during the day, and obnoxious at night unless you're already stone drunk. I am however under the impression in Amsterdam, those areas make up a comparably *larger* part of the entire inner city. In fact, many people I know will avoid the dam square area during the day at all costs, just biking/driving through it as good as they can. Now, to go back to the topic of coffee shops: not letting tourists buy weed there won't magically change that much. But I sort of *can* get behind the idea to change the center of Amsterdam from a relatively tacky place (see for example the street from Central Station to Dam Square, more or less the first thing you see when you enter Amsterdam by train: one McDonald's and KFC after another... it's ugly, plain and simple) to a more polished, upscale place for tourism. Say, like Paris or maybe even London (both cities which, I'm sure, have problems themselves finding a balance between staying 'lively', but not slipping into 'trashy' territory). And for that reason, I think disencouraging people to come over to just get drunk and stoned, by not letting tourists into the bars could be a good idea.

re: black market. That argument is not entirely wrong, but it has to be taken in context. There are thousands of cities where the drug black market doesn't interfere with the rest of life in the city, i.e. where it's small and discrete enought to be barely noticed. I strongly suspect that, if Amsterdam ever makes the coffee shops 'residents only', a black market will spring into existence, but won't be interfering too much: Dutch police is quite competent, and the NL is a pretty orderly place to begin with.",0,1351852965,null,0,false,0,c6v9e52,t3_12gd9n,t1_c6v9e52,t1_c6v520n,null,1430300105,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Really I don't have a major problem with balanced budget requirements imposed on non-currency issuing governments. They *do* need to be treated like businesses, because like businesses they are entirely dependent on revenue to finance their spending. But such governments need to be backed by a currency-issuer willing to supply stimulus in times when private demand for credit is low, ie recessions, else unemployment/prolonged recessions are inevitable.

Don't worry about it, reddit is in and of itself extremely biased and we aren't exactly a broad demographic. ;)

&gt;I personally like Cameron. He occupies the more moderate ground of the Conservatives. Frankly I think the Coalition has saved us from financial ruin by imposing austerity and keeping the interest on our insanely big government debts low.

Yeah, that's the opinion I have of him, it's why I was asking why he gets so much grief.

Sure, I might personally disagree with his view on the UK-EU relationship or on his social conservatism, but I get where he's coming from, I understand he's much more moderate than his party and that he wouldn't be where he is today if he was much more pro-EU and culturally liberal.

If I was British, I'd still probably vote for him for his economic policies (or for the Lib Dems for their support of liberalism but since they're both on coalition, it wouldn't matter much), as despite his and mostly his party's many flaws, at least they're not irresponsible and demagogues like Labour who so eagerly try to impose wealth redistribution measures that have been bringing several economies (including Portugal's) down to their knees.

In fact, I kind of wish we had a PM which was as successful as David Cameron seems to be in promoting fiscal conservatism, economic liberalism and a market economy. I'm sure if we had someone who followed these kind of policies instead of the socialist policies our José Sócrates implemented, we'd be in a much much better situation nowadays and wouldn't require to go through so many sacrifices in such a short period of time like we are going through because if that was the case, we wouldn't have never have accumulated such a massive public debt in the first place.",0,1351855887,null,0,false,0,c6v9o7i,t3_12gd10,t1_c6v9o7i,t1_c6v4ppr,null,1430300232,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

The reasoning is that the national states will take over the spending if the CAP is abolished. The farmers have significant voting power in many countries (Ex France where farmers blocked all major roads to Paris) so they will not be left to bankruptcy. Instead we will see individual levels of spending from the various national govt's, which is a situation the EU is best to avoid. This can lead to a trade war where the most subsidised goods are the cheapest on the market. Which then encourages the other countries to spend more. A vicious cycle.

In other words, I worry that ending the CAP could lead to a trade war between the member states.

Also the comparison between the numbers is stupid, they disregard the total number of people that declare themselves of a religion (wich give 41.6 million catholic for 4.5 million muslim, or ten time more) to only consider the practising member of each religion .

And of course, there is no explanation why having the biggest number of practising believer but a way smaller number of overall believer make you the dominant religion.

&gt;The farmers have significant voting power in many countries (Ex France where farmers blocked all major roads to Paris) so they will not be left to bankruptcy.

Yes, the unions have a lot of power. That doesn't mean we should support their measures on a EU scale just so that they don't revolt on a national level.

&gt;Instead we will see individual levels of spending from the various national govt's, which is a situation the EU is best to avoid.

The EU still doesn't get to decide on the national spending of its member-states neither how much of it should be in agriculture.

&gt;This can lead to a trade war where the most subsidised goods are the cheapest on the market.

Trade wars are impossible in a single market. As for the subsidised goods, if France wants them, let them, their loss as they will be the ones who'll spend massive amounts of money on their farmers and it will be all of the EU which will be able to buy their products, so the prices will remain low for all the EU consumers at the expense of only the French taxpayers. Not optimal if you're talking about the EU but definitely a better alternative than an Common Agricultural Policy.

&gt;Which then encourages the other countries to spend more.

Nope, other countries will probably just stop bothering and spend their resources elsewhere while taking advantage of the French subsidised goods. The EU consumer would benefit at the expense of the French taxpayer, if that's what France wants, they should be free to do so.

I can't really comment on the Bundesliga or La Liga, but Serie A has a notoriously defensive style.  And watching the Premiership is just as bad when you're watching a team like Stoke.  In fact I'd liken the dynamic of L1 most to the Bundesliga now, where you've always got Bayern looking to win the league title (Paris is quickly taking that mantle in France) and a handful of upper tier teams looking to capitalize on the slip-ups. 

Paris, for the foreseeable future is the prohibitive favourite to win the league; but you have teams in Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, and St. Etienne who are all competitive year in year out.  Then you've got the potential for flashes of brilliance like Montpellier had last year.

NO. Jesus do some research. The UK remains whether Scotland stays or goes. Without Scotland, it becomes a successor state to the UK before. Hence why the UK of GBR and NI is the successor state to the UK of GBR and Ireland.

But let's get one thing straight here: Google is looking out for Google and nobody else. They're not a charity, and that's not a problem. They're a corporation and they exist to generate profits for their shareholders and there's absolutely nothing wrong about that - but they're not giving stuff to society out of the goodness of their hearts, they're doing whatever they think will get them the most money, and if society is fortunate some positive things result as collateral damage, if it is less fortunate the result is less positive.

THE RISE OF ETHNIC CLEANSING

It must be stressed that at this time there was a very negative perception of the SAMI people in the Nordic countries. Government studies of ethnic cleansing were already in progress. People traveled around in the SAMI area and measured skull and body sizes. All of these exhaustive studies led towards that which later became the race laws of Nazi ideology, in which LAPPS, Gypsies, Jews and Slavic peoples were considered to be inferior and should therefore be eliminated from the face of the earth - the unwanted individuals. 

In Sweden the sterilization law was passed by the parliament in 1934.
The Norwegian parliament passed a similar law the same year.

Sort of like addiction I suppose.

Sweden has for example changed the rules for our banks after Latvia (just as we did after our own financial crises in the 90's). I hardly think we are solely responsible for the crises in Latvia though, but certainly a part of it. The banking union the EZ is talking about  - we want harder rules btw for our banks. Sweden also were solely to blame for our crises in the 90's, (even though foreign banks lended us money) and we were the only ones who could and should get us out of it. 

So, what responsibility have the Eurozone taken? No one is still following any of the rules that got you in to the disaster in the first place. In fact, the Eurozone seem to excel in bending them. The bank saves are weird, and strangely done (you just hand over money to the banks, without collateral, why?), and no one comes out to take the responsibility, fingers are just pointed, just as you try to point it now at us, who are not even in the Eurozone. 

Newsflash, the way the Eurozone was behaving and the way it was constructed, it was going to collapse sooner or later, whether the US had a housing bubble or not, and even if there had been no Swedish banks in the Baltic,that wouldn't have changed a single thing.

Attempt to circle the wagons, and accuse Britain of being un-European for not agreeing to a substantially increased budget in Europe. No mention of widespread support for the British position, no mention of France's veto threat if the most bloated programme is cut, and money moved from agriculture to infrastructure investment. And the Commissioner is from a country that would benefit as a net recipient, and whose government has already signed up to the EC's budget. I hope that other countries make their minds up on the facts, rather than all this maneuvering.

Also, there's a lack of consistency between the claimed positions of both sides. From this article:

&gt; Lewandowski sought to defend his budget proposal, saying all it asks for is year-on-year inflationary adjustments to the budget as it stands in 2013. In other words, he says, Brussels isn't asking for more money at all. 

And from a previous Spiegel article:

&gt; The Commission is calling for a budget of around €1 trillion ($1.29 trillion) for the next fiscal period between 2014 and 2020. The Commission's draft budget has been backed by the European Parliament as well as net recipient countries -- those EU member states that receive more in subsidies than they pay into the coffers.

&gt; Berlin is seeking to shave €100 billion off the budget. London want to go further and freeze the EU budget at its 2011 level, permitting only an inflationary adjustment, which would effectively trim the Commission's budget plan by €200 billion.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I am quite opposed to the CAP for many reasons, but it has to be recognized that lowering the CAP spending has to be done in a good way.

The next 7-year budget that is on the table is not lowering them. 

&gt;There are 12 million farmers in the EU, and re-educating them is both costly and time consuming. 

Who said we have to re-educate all of them? And besides, how financially sound is it to endlessly let them be supported by subsidies. It might hurt a bit in the short run, but financially it is wiser than forever sponsoring them. It is also hurting the tax payers in other ways - first we pay their salaries so they do not have to be competitive, and since they are not competitive, our food is more expensive. How is that smart? 

&gt;If measured by spending as a total of the EU budget, the CAP spending has been reduces from nearly 61% in the 1988-1992 budget (Myth 3)

That fact that it was even more ridiculously high 25(!!!) years ago, doesn't matter. They are not lowering in the next seven years, that is what matters. Also, I do not see how you can compare the EU of 1988 with the EU of today.

&gt;It is heading in the right way, but it is a long process.

How is it heading in the right way? We are all bowing down to the agricultural lobby (particularely the French part), the agriculture is ineffective, my taxmoney is going to support wine yeards, growing flowers or overusing energy and water in southern areas of Europe, and I have to pay more for my food than I otherwise would have done. The farming is ineffective, and we are harming the third world. The politicians are proving over and over again that they have no spine and the rest of Europe have to listen to the French farmers. Is that the right direction for you?  

Why not remove the CAP from the EU budget? The French can sponsor their agriculture all they want, but I trust my politicians to be a bit more sensible, and at least I know that my money will not go to a winery.

I am talking about the ability of one nation to pick up its forces move them across the planter (power projection) and then deploy in battle to destroy an enemy army (military success).


You *seem* to be more interested in something else. I'm not sure what it is, but it *seems* to be more of a  
criticism of the US's foreign policy and the results of its political decisions. You mention casualties and victims a lot. Not sure why. I **am**interested in discussing the first one, not so much the second. You won't find me defending the Iraq War. So please put that out of your mind. 


But, yes. You have touched on an important point. How do we evaluate what a successful war is? I suppose there are many ways. But we began with the statement that ""The US can't even invade an Arab nation"". My argument was that, despite the various negative side effects, the US can indeed invade an Arab nation and destroy its army with relative ease. Thats it. Thats all.

So Im a bit confused because you have now brought up casualties twice, claiming that strictly looking at casualties is not a good measure of success. But yet you do it. I can see that point form an ethical standard, but militarily, I find it to be irrelevant, especially in this context.


Why?
First, Germany shared borders with those countries, effectively walking to the engagements. You are leaving out the US's astounding ability to literally pick up and army and drop it anywhere in the world in a matter of days, if not hours. Had Germany invaded Australia instead of Holland, you would have a point. But they didn't. Lets give the US some credit for its ability to deploy. No one in the world has ever, nor  now, could come close to having that ability. No one. Ever. Period. I doubt that any modern army could even duplicate the Normandy Invasion today. This is the essence of ""power **projection**""


Second, the casualties thingy. 


a) The world population has increased from 2bil to 7bil since 1940, so in order to compare Iraq to France, you need to multiply each number by 3.6. In modern terms, the invasion of France actually cost closer to 7,000,000. 


b) Why don't we look at relative casualties? So the French lost 2.2mil, how many did the Germans lose? Either way, it's probably nowhere near as low as the Coalition casualties of the 2003 invasion. The US had less than 1,000 casualties in **21 days**. Feel free to correct me, my math sucks.



Even adjusted for population, this leads me to believe that, all things being equal, the US accomplished far more, with far less. However I will grant you that the German invasions on the 1940 were masterstrokes. But why you would bring that up in an argument about the ethics of military action is not clear to me.

Two of the worst days of the war came on Aug. 31, 2005, when a stampede on a bridge in Baghdad killed more than 950 people after several earlier attacks panicked a huge crowd, and on Aug. 14, 2007, when truck bombs killed more than 500 people in a rural area near the border with Syria.

&gt; You can agree with everything that Rachel Maddow or Ed Schultz say on MSNBC and still oppose their right to say it.

&gt; Especially when they and their hyped-up panelists shout that Republican claims are “lies,” or Chris Matthews says that Republicans view welfare recipients as “looters.” MSNBC panelists gave Mitt Romney his due on Thursday but mocked his audience. Mr. Matthews noted that when Mr. Romney called for Americans to give the poor a helping hand, Mr. Matthews said, “He got zero applause,” adding, “I think that’s so telling about tonight.”

&gt; MSNBC has pumped up its ratings by recasting itself as a left-leaning riposte to Fox News, and that’s fine. Fox long ago proved that a lot of viewers like to hear cable anchors echo what they already think; MSNBC is just playing catch-up. Fox is still well ahead, especially during a Republican convention, but on Tuesday, there were times when MSNBC drew significantly more convention viewers than CNN.

Furthermore, I don't see any reason to believe that a EU military would have any greater success at waging war or nation building than the US. In fact, the contrary.

As far as your idea of ""separating invasion from nation building"". Good point, but not what I was arguing against. 


*However*, that is interesting. I will go out on a limb and suggest that your assumption lays bare the benefits of a US-sponsored global military.

Why?

Because nation building has never been the goal of an invasion. Only when the US invades do people expect good things to follow.

delivering on that is a different story...agreed.

Hope Ive made my point clearly
