true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"Oui, l'échange de données sans limite, qui n'a jamais fait de mal à personne, qui a révolutionné la communication, l'éducation et la recherche au 21e siècle. Je veux bien qu'on me traite d'idéaliste, pourtant je ne vois personne capable de me répondre avec de vrais contre-arguments : mettez dans une balance le mal causé par l'échange des données et le bien qu'elle cause, le coté duquel il penche est très clair. 

Ensuite, si vous proposez des ""petites"" limitations pour empêcher certains problèmes, c'est vous qu'il convient de taxer d'idéalisme. Rentrons dans les détails techniques et montrez comment on peut implémenter les limitations que vous proposerez. Vous verrez alors peut-être pourquoi la position ""d'idéaliste libertin"" est de loin la plus raisonnable.

Quant à la possibilité d'utiliser du cryptage et des serveurs SSH, c'est une liberté qui n'est pas du tout protégée à ce jour. Le droit de ne pas avoir de mouchard permettant de quand même voir ce qui se passe en RAM du PC n'est pas non plus protégée. Le droit de faire tourner des logiciels open source ne l'est pas plus, quant au droit d'examiner le fonctionnement de certains appareils que l'on a soi-même acheté c'est en partie illégal (même si ce n'est pas trop appliqué en France). Ajoutons à cela que du prédicat de base que j'ai énoncé découlent une variété de choses vis à vis des protocoles propriétaires ou des DRMs.

&gt; Le second degré en politique ce n'est pas l'idéal lorsqu'on souhaite rentrer dans les institutions française. 

Je suis d'accord, c'est pas l'exercice le plus facile que de l'expliquer. Mais le parti pirate a démarré en Suède comme une blague et quand ils ont vu qu'ils arrivaient à 100 000 adhérents en quelques jours il était trop tard pour changer de nom.

&gt; Les propositions de licence globale du PP sont certes intéressantes, parce que nouvelles.

Eh bien il se trouve que le PP est contre la licence globale parce que justement il pose les problèmes de redistribution, de centralisation des droits, etc... Leur proposition est plus aboutie que vous ne le pensez et se base sur une forme de mécénat, éventuellement attachée à une taxation du numérique, mais à la condition que les échanges non marchands de données soient explicitement autorisés. C'est à dire que vous auriez l'obligation de donner un certain montant, mais en choisissant à qui vous les donnez. 

Je ne suis pas sur de voir quel est la ""question de la taxation du numérique"" ? Vous pouvez développer ? Si c'est de la taxe sur les supports numériques dont vous parlez, c'est une aberration tant dans son esprit (on taxe une pratique sans la rendre légale) que dans son implémentation (ça ne concerne pas les ordinateurs sans définir ce qu'est un ordinateur, c'est relatif à la capacité du support alors qu'on sait que cette capacité croit exponentiellement...)

Une taxe sur le stockage, sur la bande passante, pourquoi pas, mais il faut qu'elle soit faite un peu intelligemment, qu'elle finance un truc utile, et qu'elle tienne compte des contraintes de ce qu'elle taxe.

&gt; C'est tout de même bien triste de présenter l'échange de faveurs parlementaires pour illustrer l'intérêt du PP. Vous êtes en train de tolérer des pratiques que vous jugeriez peut-être inacceptables pour des partis traditionnels. 

En fait quand je suis arrivé au PP, je pensais qu'on allait pouvoir assumer un coté franchement subversif du système : exceller sans complexe aux pratiques qu'on dénonce pour mieux les détruire. Donc oui, faire des alliances de circonstance, changer de position comme de casquette, avoir un souplesse que les autres partis n'osent pas pour arriver au but final : faire passer les lois qui nous intéressent et dissoudre enfin le PP. C'est pas plus sale que du lobbying classique, ça obéit aux lois de la république et ça montre qu'à tolérer un système moisi, on peut permettre à des gens de le subvertir. C'était dans l'esprit hacker : si tu ne crois pas que ton verrou est moisi et que tu dois le changer, je te le crochète devant tes yeux, je te montre comment j'ai fait, et ça fera peut être bouger des choses.

À vrai dire, il y a deux ans, je proposais même que le PP adopte un ton de droite modérée (alors que je suis moi même plutôt bien de gauche) car c'était là que les voix me semblaient les plus nombreuses alors que l'UMP partait à la droite de la droite. Centre ou centre-droit, je pense qu'il y avait 10% à prendre. 

Mais bon, cette approche a été dénoncée par des gens comme toi, avec des arguments assez similaires. Maintenant le PP essaie d'être un parti classique (ça me fait du mal de le dire, mais si, ils ont un programme en fait assez complet qui couvre l'ensemble des volets politiques), n'essaie pas d'exploiter le système, n'essaie pas de le dénoncer ni d'être différent.

Donc là, en effet, on tend vers un parti sans intérêt. Ce qui me fait avoir un peu d'espoir c'est que la fédération des différents PP laisse pas mal de souplesse aux différentes branches régionales pour évoluer.

You know, not all linguists think alike, and different linguists say different things. Let's put it this way:

As a linguist, my opinion is that the difference between language and dialect is not well defined, and it depends tremendously on political reasons. As a linguist, I choose not to be bothered with politics, for the sake of my own sanity.

As a linguist, I deem that languages (or dialects) are created by the people speaking them, not by smart guys with glasses within the walls of a library.

And, by the way, I see you are Catalan, and I think you are extrapolating your own culture and upbringing to different areas of Europe. Average Venetian speakers are not ""convinced"" of anything, the have not ""been forced to believe"" wether what they speak is a dialect or a language, you seem to be applying your cultural oppresion from Franco to them. They have not been oppresed as you guys were, so they just don't care as much as you guys do, because they are not as politically influenced as Catalans. I don't mean it as a disrespect, as I said, I cannot be bothered with politics, but it is true that Catalan culture pivots too much around independence and differentiation, whereas Venetian culture cares about other stuff.

* Send it in as an opinion or commentary piece, to be published in something like comment is free. In which case it should be a bit snappier.

* Send it to be published as a letter to the editor, in which case it should be shorter.

In any case, I agree that you need at least one named spokesman who can act as a contact for the journalist, or a name to put to the letter, or else it is unlikely that it will be picked up.

Marriage is mostly a matter of civil law. The Bundesverfassungsgericht still rules that homosexual partnerships are not proteced by Art. 6. This doesn't mean that Art. 6 forbids same sex partnerships!
The court often bases the rulings in favor of such partnerships on Art. 3 which forbids discrimination.

I will predict that the court will change it's stance on Art. 6 sooner or later. Art. 6 does NOT state (explicitly) that marriage is Woman/Man!

BUT!
the Bundesverfassungsgericht has ruled more than once that there is no ""Abstandsgebot"" - that Art. 6 does not require marriage (Man/Woman) to be privileged over other forms of partnership ([BVerfGE 124, 199 (Rn 105)](http://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/rs20090707_1bvr116407.html))

true,attttttttttt,Aquitaine,Aquitaine,"I know I should be used to it by now but still...

Every now and then I read the exact same sentence: ""The French [...] have the expectation that visitors should [...] make the effort [...] to learn some basic French"".

You're probably right when you say we are stubborn but I don't see how you can say we expect tourists to learn any French. On what experience do you base this sentence? I'm always surprised to find people, tourists or not, who still think the French language is relevant and I go to great length to talk with them and teach them a couple more words if I can (probably because I have learnt foreign languages myself and I know how I enjoy when native speakers does that with me).

Back to my question, I have difficulty to see how we could expect so many tourists to learn even anything besides ""bonjour"". In 2011, almost 80 million tourists visited France (which is more than our total population and makes us the the top ranking country, if that means anything, according to the [World Tourism Barometer](http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights12enlr_1.pdf)).

I think it's more probably related to the fact that people who don't live in tourist areas simply don't care and others believe, rightly so, that it's part of the experience. It might also be useful to remember that tourism is estimated to represents only 2% of France's annual GDP (6% with internal tourism) so the incentive to ""adapt"" things certainly is lower than in many other countries, such as Spain for example, which rely much more on tourism for their income.

Edit: I'd like to add regarding the ""proud of their language, and especially proud of their cuisine"" point that if you have travelled to any other place, French people may not appear as proud of their particular things as they are said to be.",0,1345751122,null,0,1345751357,0,c5xp8ee,t3_ypgkh,t1_c5xp8ee,t1_c5xnp8f,null,1429717449,4,false,france,t5_2qhjz,4

&gt; b) Some sort of Federal level bureau of investigation to deal with worries of corruption. The HQ of this should not be placed in Germany (sorry Germans, but we're not ready for a secret police in Germany yet) but rather in a Nordic country or possibly Britain (if it sticks with the EU through the tighter integration). Actually I'd prefer Britain not get it. Not because they aren't excellent at policing, but because one wonders how legitimately they would go against the financial sector. All of this would work wonders with problems like Greek tax evasion.

I agree, we need more (con)federal agencies especially dealing with corruption. I don't think the location of the base is very important but I think it would be preferred that it would be located in a smaller country with a relatively healthy economy and with the least corruption in the EU (Wien, Helsinki, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Amsterdam?)

&gt; c) Similar setup to the US where a higher level government can take direct control of the finances if the local government is unable to meet their obligations (so in this case, Brussels could take over the Greek finances)

This sounds a lot easier than what it actually is. It's a good idea but who should decide when enough is enough? A majority vote in a potential senate (each country has one vote)?

C'est pas du tout censé faire ça. C'est censé assujettir à la TVA les ventes en ligne.

true,txampion,SWED,Sweden,"Finns are different from Scandinavians. Scandinavians are Germanics and Nordics and belong to an entire different language family. Finns are typically much heavier and coarser built and mostly of a rather extreme variety of the East Baltic, and often they show visual similarities with the Sami.

It is a myth spread by Finns that they are Nordic. They are not. Nordic admixture has been introduced more recently through Swedish admixture but it's not enough to conceal their basic Uralic/Eastern race. They are fundamentally non-Nordic and Eastern Uralic and sometimes Slavic in type.

Their very heavy East Baltic type lacks the refinement and gracility that you see in Nordic types, and even in some East Baltics in Scandinavia.


Something you see often in Finns is their lack of a developed nose bridge. It is very often flattish the way you see in mongoloid races, and their eyes rather often show different stages of an epicanthic fold.

Their faces are typically broad and rounded, their bone structure larger, and their noses are often short and sometimes upturned and broad at the tip. Overall their appearance is rather mongoloid and Uralic, making it obvious that their race has Eastern origin.

Finnish sub racial types appear to be dominant in a similar way that asian is dominant over caucasian, and spread easily in Scandinavia. It is a pity since it is at the expense of true Nordic types. In the interest of the preservation of Nordic races these should be kept more separate as the more recessive and gracile Nordic types such as the Hallstatt Nordic seems to become more rare as the Finnish ones spread and become more common.


I believe Finns have been ""responsible"" for damaging the Scandinavian/Nordic sub races more than any other group of people. Their migration into Scandinavia has introduced their coarser and Eastern types into the general population in a way that has proven to be damaging to Nordic sub races.

I'm hoping the latter two are just consequences. The primary regulation would just be that business in Brussels will be done in English, and any translation of public documents to a local language is the concern of the local state (be it Sweden, Finland or Italy), not the EU.

Most kids already learn English anyway, but this would admittedly be added incentive. As for the legal documents... well... most of the international agreements are in English by default anyway, so I'm not sure much would change (and I'm not sure why we'd care about the language of the will of someone that never left Naples).

&gt; I think it would be preferred that it would be located in a smaller country with a relatively healthy economy and with the least corruption in the EU (Wien, Helsinki, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Amsterdam?)

Heartily agreed. I just don't think it would have much credibility if it was located in Naples.

As an example. The day EU becomes a federation. It will be overwhelmingly more powerful then US. The EU in economy is already stronger, but the lack of centralization makes it impossible to project it. Also there isn't any common military structure. But if this changes, US is suddenly not the main player in the world. And no longer can its interests be projected without the sanctification of another power. Or if China succeeds in actually building up its system and wealth in which it to will be more powerful then US.

But only from the right wing. The left wing is questioning this critic.

Remember that we are having big elections in two months. They are playing now with €uro to get their polls up and trying to win these communal elections. Left wing is getting voters back from the most anti-EU party (Basic Finns) by this semi-negative talk and the Social Democratic Party (left) is climbing over the National Coalition party (Kokoomus, right wing) soon. While the prime-minister is from Kokoomus party and can't be anti-EU and must keep his 5 party government in order (5 out of 7 parties, only 2 is on the opposition), it gives some room for the others to be still skeptic (read:play with anti-Euro attitude) about €uro.

Peoples instead understand the reality that jumping out of € would be very costly, but they are angered of this constant crises (Greece is asking it's 3rd money aid-packet and Italy is knocking on the same door). And for Italy it's easier to criticizes Finland than Germany (both are still AAA-grade countries). Politics. Plain and simple.

However, our prime-minister Katainen said that ""shut the fuck up with those anti-euro talks"" public and that has raised the question again of open talk and debate about shit, like NATO. Is there a real debate of that or it is a cabinet secret? Finlandization again?

The Spanish Steps are just idiotic, being nothing else than a gateway to 2 or 3 shopping streets full of non-Italian products.

Hmm..favorite restaurant. To be honest, while I was there I was really poor, so I mostly stuck to grocery foods and cheap local places that aren't really anything to write home about (literally!). Haha. But, stay away from places along Las Ramblas, they're overpriced. Just look for small holes in the wall that have tapas and such, most places will be fine. Barcelona isn't really overflowing with high cuisine. You can find plenty of great places, but its not like some other major cities (NYC, Paris, etc.) in terms of its quality eateries. Just make sure to try Jamon Iberico (Ham, salt-cured served in thin slices...its not for everyone but in my opinion its like...the staple Barcelona food) on a sandwich. Sorry I can't be of more help. There was a restaurant I always wanted to try but never got around to called ""Tickets"" that was somewhat close to my house and always looked really cool and is the project of a somewhat well-known chef. I really wish I could help out more. I had a friend who was a Barcelona native and he recommended the paella at any of the restaurants along Passeig de Joan Borbo, its the street on the left side of the triangle along the marina in this link: http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Barcelona,+Spain&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=41.379224,2.189455&amp;spn=0.010401,0.017316&amp;sll=33.75571,-84.388371&amp;sspn=0.092198,0.138531&amp;oq=barcelona&amp;hnear=Barcelona,+Province+of+Barcelona,+Catalonia,+Spain&amp;t=m&amp;z=16

That triangle is called Barceloneta, like little Barcelona. That's where you'll head to the beach, cool little neighborhood with its fair share of good restaurants. One of them, called Salamanca, was always packed and had a good reputation. It's located here: http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Salamanca,+Barcelona,+Spain&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=41.378298,2.189723&amp;spn=0.005201,0.008658&amp;sll=41.378523,2.189723&amp;sspn=0.005201,0.008658&amp;oq=SalaBarcelona,+Spain&amp;hq=Salamanca,+Barcelona,+Spain&amp;t=m&amp;z=17

Also, in the same part of the city is [this place](http://gospain.about.com/od/barcelon1/ss/La-Champa-Neria-Barcelona.htm). It is popular to go there and have some Cava (Spanish champagne...basically) and a small bite to eat. Also, Barceloneta is a good place to stay as well. It kinda shuts down at night and you have to head towards city center for food or activities, BUT, you're basically a stone's throw from the beach and it has a nice charming atmosphere to it. And city center is not that far away. All depends on what you really want. Man. I could write all day, I guess I just really miss the city. Haha. So happy for you that you're going. I would also recommend, if you're there long enough, to catch a train from Sants Estacio (Saints Station...its a big hub of travel) or Plaça Catalunya to the nearby cities of Sitges and Tarragona. Sitges is a small beach town that is so quaint and beautiful, most people fall in love with it. Maybe 25-30 minute train ride. And just past it about another 20-30 minutes is Tarragona, also a beautiful little town with a lot of history. Both Tarragona and Barcelona are very old, settled by the Romans. In both there is plenty of history, but in Tarragona there is an old Roman Coliseum that is beautiful to behold. And a lot of the restaurants on the waterfront there too are great! I had friends visit and because there was like 7-8 of us, we rented a van and split it, but the train is just as good. You can get up early and hit Tarragona, then come back and spend the afternoon at the beach in Sitges, its gonna be much less crowded than Barcelona beaches. Make sure to check out Catedral de Barcelona, very beautiful with old Roman aqueducts reconstructed off to the side. And Sagrada Familia of course. It remains the most beautiful man made thing I have ever seen in my life. It's truly breathtaking. Almost dizzying inside. You just feel the majesty. If the line is long outside (like wrapping around the block) don't let it deter you: it moves very swiftly and you can look at the church from the outside as well. The views from Tibidabo (highest point in Barcelona...the mountains behind Barcelona, Tibidabo is the one with the church at the peak, you can see it from areas of the city) are breathtaking as well. However, it can take some time to get up there, so a substitute if time is a factor is Parc Guell, a beautiful park also designed by Gaudi (architect of Sagrada), that covers a large expanse. If you take the trails on up past the main area, there are numerous beautiful vistas of the entire city and sea, greatly recommended. Anyway. I could go on forever. I hope this helps somewhat, and my apologies for any typos or errors. Have fun and if you have any more questions don't hesitate to ask!

Per esempio le attività pomeridiane e i negozi che ci sono in giro. Ma se dovessi immaginare il Tasso trapiantato da qualche altra parte, sarebbe l'inferno. Il Latino e il Greco servono a imparare l'origine culturale delle americanate (come chiamare altrimenti l'Iliade? la doveva fare Schwarzenegger, altro che Pitt) e a leggere le zozzerie di Catullo.

Su Radio24 a Melog hanno presentato un libro che fornisce un programma nazionale alternativo basato su cose reali come ricerche in Rete, programmazione per scopi applicativi, etc. Professoresse con la voce da film di Dario Argento hanno telefonato insultandoli, spiegando ,quoto, che ""gli studenti in quegli anni devono soffrire"". La verità riguardo la didattica è che da noi ci arrivi per botta di culo a fare il professore, arrabbiato e vendicativo, mentre in altri paesi fanno addirittura test psicologici.

Devo fare un appunto riguardo le materie a scelta degli studenti però, che non siano vincolanti su quanto vogliono fare all'università, cosa con cui tutti gli altri paesi Europei si sono rovinati. Un ragazzo di 15-17 anni non ha idea di quello che vuole fare ed è giusto così.

Now that I think of it, we should finally translate our constitution into Danish, Frisian and Romanes, too. Right now it's merely bilingual (Standard and Low German).

Here's the article in question, current version. Note that it protects all minorities and people, but two are noted as particularly protection and support-worthy.

true,mnlg,veneto,,"Ex-PNI. Dello scientifico ho apprezzato l'ecletticita'. Uscitone potevo affrontare una carriera umanistica o tecnica con (piu' o meno) pari successo. Del latino ho fortemente detestato la letteratura ma studiandone la grammatica e i concetti ho imparato a capire meglio la mia lingua e quelle degli altri e cio' mi ha suscitato una forte passione per la linguistica. La filosofia mi ha insegnato a fare domande, non nel senso che ora quando le faccio le faccio bene, ma mi sono abituato a farle (fossi capo del mondo la renderei obbligatoria per tutti :-)); l'informatica (campo che poi ho scelto) mi ha insegnato a calcolare le risposte. Quando ero al liceo lessi una citazione di Picasso, credo, che faceva pressappoco cosi': ""I computer sono inutili perche' danno solo risposte"". All'epoca la ritenni tanto saggia quanto un obice di sterco, ma col tempo ho cambiato del tutto idea. Ma come al solito IMHO.

Va aggiunto per onesta' che solo dopo essermi confrontato con altri ex-studenti del liceo (da licei diversi dal mio) mi sono accorto che la qualita' dei miei professori era al di sopra della media. Questo forse spiega il motivo per cui sono riuscito ad apprezzare quasi tutte le materie (dai, storia dell'arte proprio no).

It must be noted though that only 50% of Europe is conversant in English. This is distorted by older people but its an issue in countries where a Romance language is spoken too. And of course, national languages must not be diminished in importance.

I agree with the idea of a European law enforcement agency that could actually do things. Stuff like only the European government being able to extradite people and have extradition agreements would be good too if such an agency was in place. 

An important thing that has been missed is that the Union needs a tax *and* spend ability. I would say making excise duties Union levy and having European, not national officials carry out this. A single European system of excise tax would also bring to an end the practice of people going across borders to buy fuel and drink.

I would need to know more about the basque man or his friends in order to know if the will know or enjoy the basque songs I would propose. In basque country's big cities , we could say there is people with strong basque culture, people with strong spanish culture, and all the mixtures and ranges between. And many of the famous music in basque could have politic connotations that some people could not enjoy. Or they just don't listen to this type of music because they don't understand the lyrics.

Anyway, if they are from Bilbao they will enjoy this for sure. It is the Bilbao's Aste Nagusia's (city festivities) song.

You cannot set up your Paypal account to have both your American and German account and use it to transfer money between the two (trust me, I've looked). The money has to come from another Paypal account. You could set up another Paypal account with your American banking info, but keep in mind this is against Paypal's TOS.

The downsides to Paypal: The exchange rate is not always the best. Plus, it takes a couple of days for the money to transfer from your Paypal account to your German account (Paypal says 1-2 business days but it took five days for me on one occasion) so if you need money fast, don't rely on it.

Another option: If you have a VISA debit/credit card with your American bank, you can take money out of the German ATM, turn around, wait in the teller line, and deposit it into your German account. The fee is 1% of your withdrawal (plus any ATM fees your bank may have). Keep in mind your debit/credit card usually has a daily limit so you should check with your bank what your limit is (also let them know you're studying abroad so they don't block transactions thinking your card has been stolen).",0,1345817294,null,0,false,0,c5y2cs8,t3_yr1za,t1_c5y2cs8,t3_yr1za,null,1429723781,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

I'm glad they did it. Neo-Nazies are getting more and more organized and the rise of Greece far-right ""Golden Dawn"" is also a bad sign. 

There are people who see an opportunity to gain some political power during these crises and the blueprint they are using is almost a copy of certain movement in Germany in the 1930's... 

In Finland there is also signs of this, True Finns raise to the parliament with a massive win on last elections and now they are making huge negative impact with all this anti-euro and ""get ride of €uro"" talks. They have also 99% support from neo-nazi groups and several drunk redneck idiots. We should raid those too. Start with Jämsä town.

My personal recommendation is to go for north tribune tickets. They are not too expensive (last season i got two tickets for the hannover match for 30€ each, that's even cheaper than ordering them from Borussia Dortmund) and you have a fairly decent view on the pitch and on the Südtribüne, the worlds largest standing tribune!

Edit: You could also attend a Bochum match. They are playing in the second division (like Duisburg), they have a pretty neat stadium though. Not as big as the Westfalenstadion in Dortmund but you sit/stand very close to the pitch and the atmosphere is great. Makes for a great experience and tickets are cheaper/easier to find.

Or if you prefer something smaller you could even get Rot Weiß Essen a try. They play fourth division, but the new stadium and the atmosphere are just fantastic. Should be really cheap.

But honestly, nothing compares to the Westfalenstadion in Dortmund with it's Südtribüne. Might be a bit expensive but it's more than worth the price.

true,Asyx,NRHW,"North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","It is not illegal to call somebody an asshole in Germany

What is an illegality to insult somebody (doesn't matter in what way) and if somebody sues, it goes into court. If the guy who got called an asshole is offended and has witnesses, he can argue that it was offending. In a normal case, the judge would probably be much less hard. He'd probably work with the parties to get to rule that out in private (which is a legal solution for civil illegalities. I did that when I was 13) and give the guy a lot smaller fine or just said that it wasn't enough of an insult in general in this situation*.

But if that idiot is hiding shit loads of money because he isn't man enough to stand up to what he has said, I'd judge the living shit out of that case as well...

*

 I don't know if that's the ordinary case in other countries but a German judge is only bound to the law and his conscience. So the judge can easily not fine anybody for such things if he thinks that it's right. It's like when a 15 years old guy get's caught with weed which he only sold to his friends and used for himself (but the amount is considered proper dealing) but doesn't get a lawsuit because that would ruin his life.

&gt;
&gt; This forced the court to investigate his fortune, and found that he lived in a 171 square metre flat, and paid €2,000 a month on his car lease alone. The court also found that he withdrew around €10,000 a month from his bank, on the basis of which it estimated his monthly income at €60,000.

His friend, Adam (Oscar Levant), is a struggling concert pianist who is a longtime associate of a French singer, Henri Baurel (Georges Guétary). A lonely society woman, Milo Roberts (Nina Foch), takes Jerry under her wing and supports him, but is more interested in Jerry than his art. Jerry remains oblivious to her feelings and falls in love with Lise (Leslie Caron), a French girl he meets at a restaurant. Lise loves him as well but she is already in a relationship with Henri, to whom she feels indebted for keeping her safe during World War II. For most of the film Jerry is unaware of Lise's relationship with Henri.

Eventually Jerry learns that Lise is in love with him but is marrying Henri the next day. He invites Milo to a masked ball that night. At the raucous masked ball, with everyone in black-and-white costumes, Milo learns from Adam that Jerry is not interested in her, and Henri overhears Jerry and Lise saying goodbye to each other. When Henri and Lise drive away, Jerry daydreams about being with her all over Paris to the tune of the George Gershwin composition An American in Paris. His reverie is broken by a car horn, the sound of Henri bringing Lise back to him.

true,Asyx,NRHW,"North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","He is still guilty of offending somebody (it sounds way less hard in English than in German) and lying to the court can increase the penalty (like a confession decrease the jail time so does hiding everything and lying about everything increase it). The judge could easily say that he doesn't get fined because he was in a hurry and it was the last parking space, it wasn't that much of an insult, the witness wasn't that trustful and it is questionable if the insult was as offending as the suing party tries to tell the court and so on

And on the other side, the personality which came to light in the lawsuit as well as lying to the court can increase the fine even though it wasn't a particular hard insult. Personality can be a very important thing in such matters. If the sued party doesn't show any kind of sorrow at all, the penalty can also be higher. Personality can be a reason for not getting a drivers licence. If you speed with 60 km/h over the limit and tell the judge that he should grow a pair and that you knew what you were doing, you can bet your cute ass that you will never drive something faster than a bicycle in Germany again. That's of course an extreme case but the principle is the same. 

Edit: After WW2 we Germany became pretty paranoid about what people are saying. If somebody would actually bother, half of those kind of laws would probably be changed a lot because they don't fit to the language and the general behaviour (which also includes suing everybody for everything) anymore. Best example is the law that gives us Germans low violence versions of games (§131 StGB).
