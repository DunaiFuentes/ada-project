At the expense of everybody else as the money as to come from taxes that increase overall unemployment and reduce the life quality for the taxpayers.

&gt;If that were to go, farmers wouldn't be able to make a profit, therefore leaving the farming business.

If they're not efficient in the first place and need subsidies to make a profit, then they should go, they'll be less of a burden on the rest of society. They don't need to be shielded at the expense of society. See [Candlemakers' petition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlemakers%27_petition).

true,blimp,TRAN,Oradea / Transylvania / Romania,"While there are problems intergrating some of the Roma people, I think Romania is one of the least racist countries in the world, and certainly a lot less so than the few countries in western europe that I've managed to visit.

As far as the Roma issue goes - people hate begging, theft and disregard for authority; there's tons of Roma people who integrate well in society (that you never hear about on the news, because they're simply a part of society and nobody thinks twice about it), there are plenty of mixed families, and nobody cares, really, about your skin colour or descent. It's perfectly possible to be a romanian ""țigan"" or to be roma and not considered a ""țigan"". It's all a matter of behaviour and refusal to abide to basic social interaction standards.

Now, you might raise the issue that certain aspects of roma traveller culture need to be protected and cherished, and it's true! There's lots of very unique gypsy music, craftsmanship, there's the romani language, there's their very way of being and their inherent joie de vivre - all things which are celebrated more in Romania than probably anywhere else in the world, and much of it has become, to some extent, a part of the Romanian culture itself.

Also, most of the western complaints about gypsies' status in Romania seem to go along the lines ""HEY ROMANIA TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOUR GYPSIES BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THEM HERE"". We've got more of them than anyone else in  Europe yet you don't see anyone trying to set their homes on fire like they do in France, Italy or Hungary.

I really don't think there's much sexism going on in Romania beyond

1. very old people / uneducated people in rural areas
2. idiots that every country has
3. ""lol go back to the kitchen"" jokes



Homophobia... now that's still  happening in Romania, and that's not ok. It's slowly changing though.

The outrage is completely the fault of the council, the only reason they had given was that the couple had 'strong views', they came to this decision because they were members of UKIP and when questioned by the couple they were told by officials that 'UKIP is racist against all Europeans' and that they weren't the right 'cultural match' or some such nonsense.

What has emerged since then (if this article is correct) is that it wasn't just because they didn't trust the foster parents, it was also because they didn't want the courts to rule that the children would be better off with their former parents which is a more understandable reason as to why they did what they did (still a stupid decision though).

After a while they should hire these people ""for realsies"", but it's cheaper to just cut them loose and get a new patch of people. This is allowed, as - after all - the unemployed person at least gets dragged out of house and doesn't get too big gaps on his CV.

If you don't go to the course/work, you lose your unemployment benefits (going gives you 9 euros extra per day). Once you are on the course, you are not among the unemployed any more, thus making the numbers more pretty.

Can you stop with this attitude. Both USA and Germany have plenty of high skilled workers coming out of their own universities. They import for a different reason.

The reason they 'import' engineers is that both have a wide and comprehensive industrial base, which means there are always niches where skills are lacking at the moment. The wider the skill base, the better the chance that you end up innovating faster than others. That is some Uni depts specialize in ML style software verifiers while another Uni might specialize in machine learning based parallelization of GPGPU. The wider the skill base, the better. That is why Germany changed its immigration strategy in the past decade and begun focusing on engineers who bring new skills to the table.

Of course Germany has highly skilled people coming from their universities. That was never the question. The question was that they aren't bringing out ENOUGH highly skilled workers due to the way the school system works. Even non-niche trained engineers have the basic skills and the ""special sets"" can be taught in the orientation. It's expensive and long-winded, but so is teaching foreign engineers German and accustoming them to German work culture. 

Also, again, we aren't talking of engineers of 20+ years of experience, we're talking young lads with ink wet in their diplomas. The universities might have some special specialisations, but they are more likely geared toward the needs of the home-industry (and future needs of home industry); not that of German industry. Only German universities can do that. And, most likely, they do. But they aren't bringing out enough students. And not because they can't - the potential students are there. But for one reason or another, they are studying to be mechanics, chefs or whatever. 

And, of course, Germany can import engineers (though the neighbouring countries that actually fund the training of engineers for larger taxes later will be unhappy for loosing their investments). But it could also import low-skilled labour instead.

Die Sorge der Verlage (so abwegig sie auch sein mag) und die primäre Motivation für das Leistungsschutzgesetz ist, dass Google durch das Einbinden und Anzeigen von Zeitungsausschnitten in seine eigenen Dienste Werbeeinnahmen erzielt, während diese den Urhebern und Verlagen entgehen, da niemand auf die eigentlichen Zeitungsseiten klickt.

Tatsächlich hatte der Konzern Angst, dass Internettelefonie ihm das klassische Mobiltelefoniegeschäft verhageln könnte. Erst nach massivem Druck aus der EU und von der Bundesnetzagentur erklärte sich der deutsche Mobilfunkanbieter gemeinsam mit Konkurrenten wie Vodafone bereit, VoIP zuzulassen, wenn die Kunden einen Zusatztarif buchen.

Sie können ganz auf Google verzichten, sie können das Erstellen von Snippets unterbinden, aber trotzdem in der Suche gelistet werden.

Evidently you are more familiar with the Hungarian perspective. I wouldn't call the land stolen, any more than you call Slovakia, Croatia, or Bosnia stolen.


From a pure military perspective Hungarians held for a long time more land than they could hold onto. They tried desperately to settle the land with Saxon (German) and Szekely colonists, which worked for a while. 


However the Romanians never warmed to being born into serfdom. For those not familiar, legally there were 3 nations who owned all the land and were allowed to take part in ruling Transylvania: Hungarians, Szekely and the Saxons (Germans). 


&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unio_Trium_Nationum


The Romanians were born into serfdom, held into serfdom and did not have any sort of rights. They were not considered citizens of Transylvania. This state of affairs did not go well with Romanians which made up a majority of the population for at least as long as there is census data for this region. 


Unfortunately, as the time went by, the Hungarians made the situation even worse and ultimately they made a futile attempt to completely assimilate the Romanians (and other so called minorities such as Slovaks) towards the end of 19th century. Again this did not go well with Romanians which by this time constituted ~~75%~~ 50% of the population of Transylvania.

All these tensions exploded in WW1 and triggered the break up of the Austria-Hungary empire.  

Had the Hungarians had a different approach towards the nationalities, probably we wouldn't have this discussion now.

With this bit of history laid bare, however, the crude reality is that the pendulum swung the other way. Now the Hungarians in Transylvania are the ones threatened with assimilation. My hope is that the Romanian leaders will see the light of day before it’s too late and not only give Hungarians and Szekely the right to preserve their culture, but encourage them to do so. After all, they pay taxes like any other citizen and they have the right to pursue happiness and freedom like all of us.

Klingt so, oder? Abgrenzendes Verhalten ist kein Privileg von Fußballfans. Wer erinnert sich daran, als in Reddit die Digg-Konvertiten begrüßt wurden. Das war ein ähnliches Verhaltensmuster.

Fußball-Fankultur bietet eine Spielwiese für ein solches abgrenzendes Verhalten. Man verhöhnt sich gegenseitig, das ist so etwas wie Fight Club oder schlagende Verbindungen in verbal, es gibt einen Comment. Wer eine solche Denkweise auf das tägliche Leben überträgt oder das Anderssein breiter fasst als ""Fan (oder Spieler) der anderen Mannschaft"", sollte in sich gehen. In dem Zusammenhang ist die Homophobie ein Schandmal der Fußball-Fankultur, Rassismus hingegen seit Jahrzehnten als Problem erkannt und bekämpft. 

Zumindest in den oberen Klassen wird sich das bald erledigt haben. Das [Konzept sicheres Stadionerlebnis](http://www.12doppelpunkt12.de/) wird für Stimmung wie in England oder Hoffenheim sorgen. Die Abgrenzungsschwierigkeiten, von denen Du andernorts sprichst, werden sich gegenüber allen Fans bals erledigt haben.

&gt;I've done my research. I've been doing my research for a year now.

I think an interesting question would be: on what? On feminism alone, perchance?

&gt;If people want men's rights then go ahead, join the MRA or another men's rights group, but if someone wants equal rights for both sexes then you would be a feminist

Says who? You? Some scholars? I can't say that I see much feminist activity toward correction of areas in life which are specifically problematic for males, or in which males are specifically disadvantaged. Frankly, nor would I expect to. The very name feminism pretty much lays bare the point behind the concept and I think that's fine. I agree that *some* feminists seek equality, although given that there are a few different definitions of equality this is almost a meaningless claim (with the caveat that pursuit of equality, regardless of the variety of which that is, is generally an indicator of someone holding good intentions).

I think you're categorising groups which do things, and have wide ranges of activists and everyday people based upon terminology, as opposed to the other way around, and I think that's really dangerous, and quite sad.

The idea that men can't get together to try and improve issues where men are disadvantaged without being called a hate group also seems very sad to me. I welcome non-radical feminism because women are still massively screwed over in much of the world, but I think in the west there needs to be a recognition that we're at least heading for a stage where inequality is less a clear cut imposition of one sexes will upon another and more of societal failings which afflict both sexes.

&gt;I have argued so many times with men's rights redditors over what they think women --particularly feminists --are doing (taking away male dominance and replacing it with female dominance --not that both have an equal opportunity, which is what it is genuinely doing.)

There are uninformed people and idiots in every movement. As I said, I wouldn't call myself an MRA (nor a feminist), but I can't say that I've read many which seriously think that feminism is about reversal of dominance of genders to an inverted 16th century standard. Many do seem to feel that equality of outcomes is damaging to them, and there are valid arguments on both sides there. I can't help but feel that this argument is a common strawman, and I do wonder at times whether the understanding gap between the two groups here is really that big, or whether arguments like this are brought out to score points (no offence intended here, it just seems so unlikely that members of feminist groups and MRA groups would have such profound misunderstanding of each other).

&gt;What do you think men's rights groups fight for versus feminism?

If I've understood your question properly, then plenty: There are plenty of areas in my own society (UK) at least where men don't come out very well. Occupational health, paternity rights, discrimination cutting both ways, recognition of domestic violence and rape even *occurring* against men.

There are plenty of issues which predominantly affect men, or which affect men and women but are only currently really cared about with women.

-Christmas services at cathedrals. Go to one of the many large gothic cathedrals and sit in on a beautiful and traditional service.

-Go skiing! Its great fun and I always met new friends at the lifts and lodges

-Oberammergau- Famous for the passion play at Easter time, but BEAUTIFUL in the winter. When I was there years ago they used the passion play theater for a life-action play of the birth of Jesus with real animals, etc etc. It was pretty sweet. 

-Neuschwanstein. Also stunning with a coat of snow.

-Black forest BEST. CAKES. EVER.

-Rotenburg-Some of the coolest and oldest city walls in Germany

-Furth im wald The COOLEST medieval play ever. They fight a ""live"" dragon (its mechanical and breathes fire) {im not sure when the play is though}

Right now, spending more money in the military won't serve as a deterrent against anyone as nobody dares to start hostilities against us, the whole idea is inconceivable as both us and the rest of the world would have nothing to benefit from this, I'd rather if we kept the status quo, not increasing military funding and also not increasing taxation to pay for an expanded military.",0,1354398421,null,0,false,0,c79qo50,t3_143nqm,t1_c79qo50,t1_c79q7fo,null,1430552093,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Darwin und Lamarck (wobei Letzterer als Beispiel für weitere mögliche Theorien angeführt wird). Art und Lehrumfang der Theorie sind jedoch nicht festgeschrieben.

Journalistische Beiträge sind insbesondere Artikel und Abbildungen, die der Informationsvermittlung,
Meinungsbildung oder Unterhaltung dienen.

Das schließt einige Blogs ein. Die Abgrenzung, was ein Presseerzeugnis ist und was ein Verleger, dürfte in jedem Fall äußerst subtil sein. Es ist also nicht klar, wer ein Verleger ist und für wen dieses Leistungsschutzrecht gilt. Ergo:

**Google kann nicht wissen, wen es aus dem Index nehmen soll.**

Für Google ist es technisch nicht möglich zu erkennen, wer das Leistungsschutzrecht in Anspruch nehmen kann, und wer nicht. Wenn man jetzt davon ausgeht, dass die SEO-optimierten (was ja an sich schon lustig ist) Links nicht geschützt sein werden, sondern nur die Snippets, muss Google, um sicher zu sein nicht verklagt zu werden, alle deutschen Snippets entfernen und Google News Deutschland dicht machen.

Jackets don't always match the trousers but accessories are subtly chic and high quality.

I see young guys in Canadian Goose, black, slightly laminated ski jackets with large fur trimmed hoods (young ladies too) and skinny jeans in classic blues tucked into high top baskets. And if you go to Courier then you'll find yourself falling over these guys. 

It's a shame you really don't see many guys with a punk style though, there is so many preppy guys and smart guys too but not enough alternative. I haven't seen a mow hawk in months :S

[Men's rights argue that men are oppressed and that women are dominant (in other words, we live in a matriarchy --I guess that's why women are pressured to change their names when they get married but men don't have to.)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men's_rights_movement) Men are oppressed by women. Men live in a patriarchy where women have been, and somewhat still are oppressed for 6,000 years by rigorous gender roles and sexualized culture but men are the ones that are truly oppressed. While we're at it, Christians are oppressed too. And white people in Europe are oppressed, by black people of course.

If you Google ""men's rights"" and skip the men's rights websites and just go to news sources then you will see the answer for why men's rights is a hate group is pretty cut and dry.

This one [men's rights article](http://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/the-top-10-issues-of-mens-rights/3/) cites gender disparities harming men giving a list of 10 claims, with #9 being:

""9.) Negative Portrayal in the Media (5%)
Tired of seeing dumb and deadbeat dads? Sick of every man on TV being a sex-obsessed womanizer? So are we. Men are often seen as incompetent, misogynistic, brutish slobs with few redeeming qualities. When there is a boys vs. girls competition in a children’s television show (when scripted), the girls always win and boys are treated like fools. When boys complain, they’re expected to “man up.” TV shows, commercials, and movies ought to portray men in a more positive light.""

This is a FEMINIST issue. Media is controlled mostly by men (directors, writers, etc.) and this is one of the many problems that is apparent in media. The ""man up"" idea is a thing brought up by male-dominant culture where men say other men shouldn't be emotional or else they're --gasp --like women (who are weaker, inferior, emotional, etc.)


I've done my research on both men's rights and feminism.

That's why I'm a feminist.

&gt;Says who? You? Some scholars? I can't say that I see much feminist activity toward correction of areas in life which are specifically problematic for males, or in which males are specifically disadvantaged. Frankly, nor would I expect to. 

Do men's rights groups fight for LGBTQ rights? Feminists do, and it affects both men and women. Where I see men's rights groups fighting for privilege, I see feminists [fighting for equal rights.](http://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/aisha-mirza/uk-feminists-fighting-for-rights-not-privilege) In order for this sexism and oppression for both sexes to stop, then we must start with the ones who are genuinely oppressed first before there is equality. There isn't going to be race equality between whites and blacks if whites get more advantages then blacks; in order to equalize gender disparity, as with race, religion, and sexuality, it must start with the group that is oppressed first.

&gt;The very name feminism pretty much lays bare the point behind the concept and I think that's fine. 

Okay. This is called assuming. You assume something is pro-female dominance because it says ""feminism"". You ask me if I did my research but did you do your's? Because your response is lacking evidential input.

&gt;If I've understood your question properly, then plenty: There are plenty of areas in my own society (UK) at least where men don't come out very well. Occupational health, paternity rights, discrimination cutting both ways, recognition of domestic violence and rape even occurring against men.

[Men are less likely to go to get check ups.](http://www.mdanderson.org/publications/focused-on-health/issues/2010-september/checkup.html)

[A study also proved this to be true.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447395/)

Also, did it ever occur to anyone for the reason why mothers tend to get child custody during divorce cases? Did thousands of years of degrading women to be sex objects, baby machines, and main child care takers ever cross anyone's minds? Yes, child custody is a problem (in the US, the custody rights are 50/50 but with some divorce courts mothers will generally tend to be the main care takers before the divorce, therefore they usually end up with the children after divorce) but people aren't computers and we can't erase the memory of billions of people and start fresh, we must approach this with addressing the objectivism and care taker stereotyping in mass media and other causes, such as tradition. 

Discrimination does cut both ways but it's discrimination brought on by patriarchy and yes it hurts both men and women but advocating for men's rights isn't going to help destroy the problem, it's going to keep it --if not make it bigger.

Domestic violence is a serious issue for both sexes and the [Home Office](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/violence-against-women-girls/domestic-violence/) already started an effort to relieve that back in 2011. Even though 2 women die a week from domestic violence, [1 man dies every 3 weeks in the UK from it.](http://www.ncdv.org.uk/maleDVweek.html) I don't care who it is, domestic violence is horrible and it shouldn't happen. There has been a a rise in domestic violence against men, and it's just about the same as domestic violence against women in the UK and [men can fight for the end of domestic violence against them under feminism.](http://desifeminists.wordpress.com/2010/01/23/violence-against-men-is-a-feminist-issue/) A lot of feminism websites citing [violence against men](http://hellyeahfeminism.tumblr.com/post/19011685222/domestic-violence-against-men-know-the-signs) are trying to find ways to end this heinous act against men whereas any men's rights website will not only point out the violence against men, but they will also say it's feminism's fault. 

And the draft in the military? Ugh, I hate that crap. I wish there was a draft for women because I am more than ready to serve for my country but alas, patrirachy thinks I'm too precious to possibly die in the battlefield. Every women to ever join the military did it voluntarily. In fact, in some countries they were killed. In the US, over 800 women fought for the Civil War, and some liked secretly being men so much that they continued to pretend to be men after the war. In China, the ever-famous Mulan was executed after they found out she was a woman, kind of like Joan of Arc. I don't like the that only men get the draft and feminism fights for an equal-opportunity draft (as well as men's rights, but every men's rights website that says they fight for a gender equal draft blames the male-only draft on feminism.) The draft is a feminist issue. Instead of fighting against feminism, men should be fighting for feminism, for equal rights for both men and women. Men's rights says feminism is women-only and discriminates against men, but the root of the problem is thousands of years of patriarchy. Men are not the problem, patriarchy is, and fighting for male privilege in a patriarchy is like fighting for white privilege in a white-dominant country. Men's rights aren't for equal rights, they're men's rights and blaming feminism for everything patriarchy did.

Men's problems in our society is a product of thousands of years of sex and gender discrimination brought on by patriarchy but go ahead and blame it on the feminism.

I think you might have hit the Musée d'Orsay on the first Sunday of the month. Museums are free that day so there are always massive lines, especially at Orsay because there's only one entrance.

If you're going into the Louvre, the longest lines are at the aboveground entrance (the pyramid). Instead, go in via the underground mall (from the metro, follow the signs to the Carrousel du Louvre).

But honestly, you might want to avoid the Orsay and Louvre altogether. They're always jammed and I find it difficult to enjoy them. The smaller museums like the the Rodin or the Orangerie are much more pleasant, as are the ones less known to tourists, like the Quai Branly.

To answer your original question, I'd say the pass is well worth it if you're intending to visit at least two of the participating museums or monuments a day. It will give you the freedom to run in and out of museums - if you go into the Louvre and it's especially packed that particular day, you won't feel obligated to stay and get your money's worth. 

I think you'll also be more likely to try some of the more unusual attractions, like the sewers (égouts de Paris), since you'll have nothing to lose. And then if you happen to find yourself in the neighbourhood of one of the museums on the list you can drop in on a whim.

The pass also gets you into the castles at Fontainebleau and Versailles, and since you have almost a full week in the city, I would definitely recommend heading out to one of them.

On the other hand, if you want to just relax and wander around the city and do a museum every other day, the pass won't save you any money.

One note: if you do get the pass, I would only go for the four-day option. You're not likely to do much sightseeing on your travel days beyond getting your bearings and strolling around the city, and most museums are closed on Mondays so you should only count from 27-30 December.

Nicht ganz, die Privatschulen sind nicht an die Lehrpläne gebunden, jedoch indirekt an deren Inhalte. In der Praxis stellen die Privatschulen ihre Lehrpläne unabhänig auf und reichen diese beim Ministerium ein. Dort wird die Gleichwertigkeit der Lehrinhalte zwischen den staatlichen Lehrplänen und denen der Privatschulen geprüft.

Das ist im Prinzip richtig, der Gestaltungsspielraum einer Privatschule erstreckt sich in erster Linie auf pädagogische Konzepte (bspw. Waldorfschulen), weltanschaulich/konfessionelle Ausrichtung (bspw. katholische Schulen) und wirtschaftliche Möglichkeiten.

Il dibattito per le primarie del PD è stato uno scimmiottamento delle pessime primarie USA, dove non viene valutato minimamente cosa il candidato sappia fare e non si entra mai nel merito di niente in modo serio.

Tutto è ridotto ad una sorta di quizzone dove il candidato deve dimostrare di avere una conoscenza globale di ogni materia possibile (lol) e ad una specie di guerra verbale dove bisogna essere più sagaci dell'avversario per fare punti (che mi ricorda molto il duello di insulti di Monkey Island).

Cosa tutto questo abbia a vedere con il saper governare un paese io davvero non lo so.

Per intenderci se dico ""Mario Rossi mi ricorda una capra"" esprio un'opinione, se dico ""Mario Rossi si incula le capre in via Frattina"", lo sto diffamando.

Bene, **il fatto**: nel 2007 una ragazzina di 13 anni rimane incinta e vuole abortire ma non vuole farlo sapere al padre. Lei e la madre si rivolgono al giudice tutelare il quale dà il permesso alla figlia e alla madre di prendere una decisione in totale autonomia. Tutto ciò si è svolto applicando perfettamente le leggi italiane.

**L'articolo**: Renato Farina (già noto per pubblicato dossier falsi e al soldo dei servizi segreti) scrive sotto lo pseudonimo di ""Dreyfus"" un articolo incendiario dal gusto fascista e ultracattolico ([scaricabile qui](http://rassegna.camera.it/chiosco_new/pagweb/getPDFarticolo.asp?currentArticle=DHQW1)), con frasi come

&gt; ""... ci fosse la pena di morte, e se mai fosse applicabile in una circostanza, questo sarebbe il caso. Per i genitori, il ginecologo e il giudice""

Questa è un'opinione, che ha tutto il diritto di avere. Purtroppo per noi, e per Sallusti, contiene anche frasi che non sono opionini ma *fatti falsi*:

- Il titolo: ""Il giudice ordina l’aborto / La legge più forte della vita"". Falso, il giudice non ha ordinato nessun aborto.
- ""Un magistrato allora ha ascoltato le parti in causa e ha applicato il diritto – il diritto! – decretando l’aborto coattivo"". Falso, il giudice ha dato facoltà di scelta a madre e figlia, secondo l'ordinamento giuridico italiano.
- ""Si sentiva mamma. Era una mamma. Niente. Kaput. Per ordine di padre, madre, medico e giudice, per una volta alleati e concordi"". Falso, il padre non sapeva niente e le firme per procedere con l'aborto sono quelle di madre e figlia.
- ""Questo racconto tenebroso è specchio dei poteri che ci dominano [...] Che la medicina e la magistratura siano complici ci lascia sgomenti"". Non c'è nessuna complicità e desiderio di compiere milioni di aborti: la figlia ha applicato un suo diritto medico.

Il giudice in questione si sente diffamato, dato che non ha ordinato nessun aborto e non vuole che gli si dia dell'omicida. Siccome l'autore dell'articolo era, al tempo della pubblicazione, ignoto, la responsabilità del suo contenuto ricade sul direttore. Tutta la faccenda finisce in tribunale, dove viene deciso che l'articolo è diffamatorio, con conseguente pena.

Sia strachiaro che qu non c'è nessun ""reato d'opinione"", perché invece si tratta di un articolo con fatti falsi. Che a Sallusti e Farina non piaccia l'articolo 194 va benissimo, ma la diffusione di notizie diffamatorie che favoriscano la loro agenda non è una condizione sufficiente per diventare martiri della purezza del giornalismo.

Poi si può discutere se la galera sia una pena eccessiva, ma si evitino le filippiche sul povero Sallusti che non può dire la sua.",0,1354450831,null,0,false,0,c79zvwy,t3_143z30,t1_c79zvwy,t1_c79zeal,null,1430556503,12,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,12

No problem! Appreciate the long thought out answer.

&gt;I can link a multitude of reddit links and comments subjecting to this kind of hate. I know some are trolls, but the majority of reddit? Do you see the up vote-downvote amount for the comments on this thread alone? That should tell you something, and it's really, really disappointing for our future.

The majority of reddit doesn't say stuff like this though (at least my parts of reddit) - you picked the one, trollish, most downvoted comment thread in a big thread, and you cite that as example of the general beliefs even when it's obviously an unpopular position to hold from its position in the thread.

&gt;Men's rights argue that men are oppressed and that women are dominant (in other words, we live in a matriarchy --I guess that's why women are pressured to change their names when they get married but men don't have to.) Men are oppressed by women.

Ok, firstly, please stop saying ""Men's rights argue X"" - mens rights is a concept, and mens rights groups argue for whatever they damn well please, me saying I support equality so see the concept as valuable does not mean I support all of the groups. I'm very concerned with the general trend of equating the concept with any and all groups, by the public and especially by some feminist and other groups in direct opposition.

As to the terminology, I'm not sure I'd really either sex is oppressed anymore in any sort of complete sense, so I'd disagree with the usage. However I do think that there are clearly issues in which men specifically aren't doing very well in society, be they legal, social, or whatever.

&gt;Men live in a patriarchy where women have been, and somewhat still are oppressed for 6,000 years by rigorous gender roles and sexualized culture but men are the ones that are truly oppressed.

Some may say this, I would not. I also despise this competition of *who can claim to be more oppressed* - the very word starts to sound ridiculous when people use it overly to me already, without a need for people to be trying to show how or why their gender is X times more oppressed than the other. What we need is not a competition to show who ""truly"" is worse off, but rather just solutions to make everyone better off. 


&gt;If you Google ""men's rights"" and skip the men's rights websites and just go to news sources then you will see the answer for why men's rights is a hate group is pretty cut and dry.

Firstly, again with the ""mens rights"" as a single grouping, it doesn't work like that. Secondly, I don't find any actual hate in there, just claims of it. I've heard plenty of claims by many that men's rights groups are hate groups, and while some groups who fly under that banner certainly are filled with a bunch of idiots, by and large men's rights carry out no actions which seem hateful. Lots of attempts at shouting down, not much compelling argument. If you yourself would like to raise any specific issues which you take to be general dogma of the movement then I'd be happy to listen, because most of what I see in your links looks like either straw men or hyperbole.

&gt;This is a FEMINIST issue. 

This really bugs some feminists doesn't it? Why does there being other groups out there which want to deal with gender inequalities piss you and others off so much?

&gt;Media is controlled mostly by men (directors, writers, etc.) and this is one of the many problems that is apparent in media.

D'you have sources for that? Regardless if you do or don't though, negative portrayal is largely down to society accepting it and even enjoying to see it, honestly if feminists want to oppose this then cool, but that won't make me a feminist, men's rights groups oppose it too and that doesn't make me one of them, but I oppose it. This all seems very territorial.

&gt;then we must start with the ones who are genuinely oppressed first before there is equality.

Again with the territorial pissing contest. If you agree that gender inequality (as with all forms of inequality) affects everybody, and not just a single gender, then I really don't see how you can claim you want equality if you're going to lay out in opposition to people who fight for it in society.

&gt;Okay. This is called assuming. You assume something is pro-female dominance because it says ""feminism"". You ask me if I did my research but did you do your's? Because your response is lacking evidential input.

No no no. While I do believe that there are feminist groups out there who *are* for matriarchy, in general I believe the vast majority to be seekers of equality of one form or another. This would be assuming on your part, perhaps.

&gt;whereas any men's rights website will not only point out the violence against men, but they will also say it's feminism's fault.

I'd ask you to cite examples but you'd probably find at least one or two, I agree that some men's rights groups blame feminism for the biased focus on domestic violence. I can see two options for a view here, that because society and feminist groups focus overwhelmingly on male on female violence, that feminist groups are an issue (not my viewpoint) - or that before feminist groups started talking about DV, no-one was, that feminist groups have succeeded in making people aware that there exists a problem (male on female DV) and that since it doesn't seem to be going to happen without it, men's rights groups must now make society aware that female on male DV occurs and is also a problem in society.

This doesn't impinge upon feminist goals or ideals, it's not an attack upon feminism, it's simply an attempt to make society aware that female on male domestic violence occurs, and that men do get battered and harmed by their loved ones. Is this such a problem? I know you feel this is a feminist issue, but frankly, if feminist groups were taking care of the issue, men's rights groups would have one less reason to exist.

&gt; patrirachy thinks I'm too precious to possibly die in the battlefield.

This is probably not the reason you're disallowed from serving in the military. In my own country women are allowed to serve in every branch except frontline infantry, with the military citing physical reasons as their opposition. Make of that what you will.

Anyway, with occupational health I was more referring to the fact that men overwhelmingly serve in the more dangerous professions, and these are often lacking in safety (mining, fishing, construction, etc.). I see this as a problem, not a problem I want to fix by forcing lots of women into the industries, just a problem I want to try and find a solution for in general.

This doesn't all have to be zero sum thing, and it seems sad to me that many view it this way.

&gt;Men's problems in our society is a product of thousands of years of sex and gender discrimination brought on by patriarchy but go ahead and blame it on the feminism.

I don't, most don't. There's a lot of anger to feminism in the men's right community, but lets face it, few feminist groups have ever been anything but hostile to the very concept of men's rights groups, so I can understand that this unfortunate oppositional approach has occurred. I think in general both camps are wrong on the ""no its your fault"" thing.

As for where men's problems stem from, you know what? I don't care. I have serious doubts whenever someone claims that every single problem affecting all people comes from patriarchy, but if you want to say that then sure, whatever. I don't care. I care about solutions, solutions are legal, social, cultural. I think most MRAs do, I hope most feminists do, but I'm quite sure most people who'd self-describe as egalitarian would seek this.

The hatred and shouting down which passes between these two sets of groups really worries me, it's not necessary, it's damaging, and it's *really* unproductive.",0,1354451368,null,0,false,0,c79zxp9,t3_13zjwb,t1_c79zxp9,t1_c79vukp,null,1430556527,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Excellent article by anthony beevor, but I would like him to explore this statement further:

“In Italy, the Five Star party of the comedian Beppe Grillo swept past all the traditional parties in local elections and is now expected to take 12 per cent of the vote in national elections. In Germany, recent poll estimates gave the Pirate Party 10 per cent of the vote, ahead of the Greens, even if this was not quite confirmed in the North Rhine-Westphalia election. Is this development similar to the 1930s, where countries with systems of proportional representation found themselves vulnerable to political polarisation and disorder? Is the whole European project doomed to achieve the opposite of what it set out to achieve? Will the European centralising ideology, and now the need proclaimed by some leaders to exert a quasi-dictatorship over the eurozone, exacerbate the militant nationalism that it sought to make redundant?”

I believe he is right, but I’d like to know why he believes this.

The FPTP electoral system has fantastic advantages over PR because by giving a government so much power to make change you allow it to react to a changing world more readily than can ever be achieved in the viscous morass of coalition politics as typified by the continent. For a people that are happy to accept that challenge; to compete with the rest of the world with ideas and commerce there is no better system of governance, however its major problem is the need for a cohesive society.

Throughout centuries of brutal warfare, from the Thirty Years War, the Napolenic War, the Franco-Prussian War, the First World War, the Second World War, and many more, europe has suffered political instability repression and revolution. How many EU countries have not been facist, communist, revolutionary, dictatorships, or repeatedly invaded in the last three hundred and fifty years? Only one. Have many have suffered at least one of the above within living memory? The rest. The EU represents stability to the continent, a framework for peaceful cooperation for the past half century.

The fascination with using proportionalism in defence of ‘victim’ groups, the institutionalisation of multitudinous identities, and the end of majority rule in favour of power sharing, all of these serve to break the network of trust that binds the citizen to their state, to be replaced with endless waltz of realignments as you ceaselessly redefine your identity, and a serf-like deference to a supra-national authority. You are too busy to care about the previous loyalty, and anyway, wasn’t it replaced by something ‘higher’?

All of this must be at least somewhat appealing to peoples who have never been properly protected by their state, whose shifting borders have left pockets of ‘others’ cheek-by-jowl with people whom they share no common history, and people who retain a nascent wariness of whatever catastrophe will next be inflicted upon them by their neighbours. Wouldn’t it be so much better if there were a less contentious way to live…………

It is no coincidence that many european states have a political system based on proportional representation, why would you not when repeated trauma and dislocation prevent the electorate from trusting the politician not to become a tyrant, and the politician from trusting the electorate not to install a demagogue. Democracy is the fusion between the Demos and the Kratos and in europe there are evident fractures between the two.

As for Britain, remember that although the EU was born of fear we joined for economic reasons, and that we have not in recent history suffered; unstable borders, traumatised populace, displaced people, revolutions, fascism, communism, or dictatorship. Britain is an island nation, as a result of which we have no compelling motive to dilute our aims and expectations with groups whom we do not share a common history, that fear does not exist. The first-past-the-post electoral system is more than anything a declaration of trust in the cohesiveness of ones society, and by the same token a rejection of the victim politics commonly used to justify proportional representation.

When you hear people whine about the “tyranny of the majority” they are really only transplanting a problem from the continent in an effort to hide the growing obsolescence of the view they represent. The most important benefit of the FPTP system over PR is that it allows the electorate to punish failure, by kicking them out of office.

It allows change that can keep pace with events, thus prioritises evolution over revolution.

Tipping, I have seen Americans tip really well, but it is unnecessary to keep to the 10 or 20% rule here as we pay them a normal wage, though the serving staff will love you for tips that would be considered sub par in America.

So there is a possibility that the semesters have already started when you arrive, and also the possibility that you are leaving before the semester is at it's end.

If there's a greater benefit in the oil business then you should specialize in that and not artificially raise the prices in the agricultural sector to make up for the difference and encourage farmers.

We don't have and we can't be self-sufficient in everything, it's a free market and specialization which is able to allow us to live so well so cheaply.

More reasons for you to not specialize in agriculture and dedicate yourselves to sectors where you'll benefit more.

Food security is not about quality standards

Food security is not about the EU lacking the capacity to supply us currently.

Food security is not a peasant conspiracy

Did you even read the abstract section for the paper i linked you to? You know, the lazy TLDR; section of an academic paper?

&gt;Warfare, trade disruptions, environmental crises and the global food situation are all potential threats to national food security in developed countries. In order to cope with important crisis scenarios domestic food production capacity is particularly needed. In highcost
countries a ‘laissez-faire policy’ could almost cease the agricultural commodity production and lead to under-provision of public goods (e.g. food security).

&gt;In Norway food security has been a national priority since the Second World War. Important parameters in this context have been the degree of food self-sufficiency (measured as the energy content of the food) and certain production goals.

&gt;3 Crisis scenarios
Potential threats to national food security are many. Earlier, the main focus was on food security in connection with wars and trade disruptions. During recent years, there has been increasing focus on potential environmental crises and the global food situation. No one
wishes for such a situation to arise. Nevertheless there is a unknown and unpredictable probability for the occurrence of such crisis scenarios.

3.1 Warfare
Considerable conventional and nuclear armed forces are positioned close to Norway. The
power structure is asymmetrical, with a superpower bordering on a small country in a strategically
important region. The development of Russia’s domestic situation is uncertain. Armed
conflicts may spread to areas adjacent to Norway. Still there is significant tension in Europe.
There is no guarantee that new conflicts will not break out. The main objectives of Norwegian
security policy are still to contribute to a stable and peaceful development, protect national
sovereignty and to preserve national rights and interests (Ministry of Defence 1998).
National security and defence are dependent on the civilian society. Changes within civilian
social structures and activities play an important role for the development of Norwegian
defence policy (Ministry of Defence 1998:44). Food security is a major element of an overall
defence strategy. In this context, Norwegian authorities emphasise the maintenance of the
country’s food production capacity on its limited farmland resources. In case of a long-term
crisis, the goal is to secure the domestic self-sufficiency ability (Ministry of Justice 1998:38).

3.2 Trade disruptions
An embargo aims at preventing a country from importing goods. There may be more efficient
means of exerting political pressure than by curtailing imports of food (Winters 1990). The
obvious alternative is energy – specifically the supply of oil. Few countries are self-sufficient
in oil, and in the short run there are few substitutes. However, Norway is in fact a major oilexporting
nation.
Extensive food embargoes are rare and very few of those that have been conducted were
successful (Winters 1990). This may not be very surprising, since most countries do aim at
securing a minimum national food production. A country may become more vulnerable to
foreign pressure and sanctions if its national food self-sufficiency ability is reduced. Thus, one
ought to be careful when referring to the historical lack of successful food embargoes in the
discussion of agricultural trade liberalisation. The effect of such embargoes could be greater if
domestic food production capacity is reduced.

3.3 Environmental crises
Floods, draughts, frost, hurricanes, earthquakes, diseases, pests, etc. can lead to significant,
temporary declines in local or regional food production. Even though these are the result of
adverse natural conditions, the effects thereof can be influenced by human activity. In a global
perspective, such disasters seldom affect large areas. Affluent households can easily purchase
food from other regions. Rich countries thus have little to fear from temporary food shortages
due to local disasters. However, developing countries may have to take such scenarios into
consideration.
Widespread food shortage can, however, occur in the case of extensive ecological disasters,
e.g., nuclear accidents followed by radioactive fallout over large farming areas. In such cases,
it is probable that countries will first secure the food supply of their own citizens, before
selling any surplus. World market prices could rise significantly. In the worst case, it would be
difficult, or even impossible to purchase food on the world market. These scenarios need to be
taken into consideration by affluent, industrialised countries.

3.4 The global food situation
Enough food is available to meet the basic needs of each and every person in the world.
However, available food is neither evenly distributed nor fully consumed among and within
countries. As a result, approximately 840 million people in the developing world are
chronically undernourished (FAO 1996).
There are diverging views as to how the global food situation will develop. Some are optimistic
that the future food supply will be assured through improved productivity, and that the
warnings regarding environmental deterioration are exaggerated (e.g., Johnson 1998). Whereas
others can be classified as cautious optimists, there are also those who fear that the world’s
food production capacity will be limited (e.g., Brown 1996).
The uncertainty in the long run global food situation demonstrates the need for national food
security strategies. Due to its substantial buying power, Norway will easily be able to purchase
enough food on the world market in a conceivable situation of a global food shortfall. Nevertheless,
NOU (1991a:312) claims that in such a situation it is both morally and politically
necessary to maintain a high degree of national food production capacity. The main emphasis
in this context is not to be placed on the current food production, but rather on sustainable
management of the potential food production resources.
Features of a crisis like size and location, time horizon, time for warning prior to the occurrence
of the crisis, and consequential damages on the production potential of a crisis (e.g.
radioactive fallout) have food security implications (Romstad et al. 2000:48). The diverse
crisis scenarios have different implications for the strategies needed to maintain food security.

As you can see on this map Hungarians were clearly harmed in Trianon. I'm thinking mostly about southern Slovakia, but also about Transilvania.

http://i.imgur.com/Tmc0v.png

This map show early XXI century distribution of Hungarian population. I marked approximate borders:

* red line - historical Kingdom of Hungary

* black line - 1940 border

Imagine it's 1920 again and we are going to draw borders. Southern Transilvania obviously should go to Romania as Romanians were and are clear majority there. Northern Transilvania - well, here things are becoming tricky. I personally think northern part should remain in Hungary. You can say ""well, but then there are Romanians left in Hungary"". Sure they are, but so are now Hungarians in Romania, and at least this way lands remain with historical owner. 

Of course it was always impossible to draw continuous fair Hungarian-Romanian border but of three we had in XX century (Kingdom of Hungary border, Trianon border, Vienna award border) I think about black one (maybe with some corrections in favor for Romania) as the most fair.

If it's troubling you, take a look at how quickly others are being served and gesture to a waiter when you're able to catch their eye. Perhaps try to catch a waiter's eye as you sit down.

Farina scrive un articolo diffamatorio -&gt; Sallusti sotto la sua responsabilità lo pubblica -&gt; Sallusti viene condannato.

&gt; Attento: l'omesso controllo c'entra pure qui, perché il motivo per cui a Sallusti danno il carcere è per via dei precedenti

Assolutamente no, i precedenti non sono causa della condanna.

Riporto dalla sentenza:

&gt; Hanno aderito a questa ipotesi concorsuale i giudici di merito ponendosi nell'ancor più specifico orientamento giurisprudenziale (sez. V. n. 16988 del 10.1.2001 ,in Cass .pen. 2002, n. 753 ,p. 2344) , secondo cui la pubblicazione di un articolo senza nome, e quindi senza l'indicazione della persona che si assume professionalmente la responsabilità delle notizie e delle valutazioni in esso contenuti; comporta l'attribuzione dell'articolo al direttore responsabile , per la sua consapevole condotta volta a diffondere lo scritto diffamatorio.

Ovvero: la legislazione ha già stabilito che gli articoli scritti da anonimo sono sotto responsabilità del direttore...

&gt; La configurazione non del reato ex art. 57 c.p., bensì del reato ex artt. 110 e 595 c.p., corrisponde alla razionale esigenza di non creare -in sede interpretativa- una sorta di zona franca, l'abrogazione di fatto dell'art. 595 c.p. ,nella fattispecie della diffamazione commessa con nom de piume

... e questo serve per evitare che sia possibile diffamare chiunque a mezzo stampa con semplici articoli sotto pseudonimo.

Se leggi la sentenza della cassazione, vedrai che il carcere è comminato per questo reato e non per la ""spiccata capacità a delinquere"" (ovviamente la Cassazione non può comminare alcuna pena per fatti passati). La frase in questione è una nota a margine che nota come Sallusti non sia nuovo ad articoli diffamatori (qualcuno si ricorda ancora di Boffo?). È come se uno spacciatore venisse arrestato con un 1kg di cocaina, nella sentenza si dicesse che era già noto alle forze dell'ordine per aver spacciato marijuana e gli amici dell'arrestato dicessero ""eh, lo arrestano per i fatti passati"". No, i fatti passati indicano che è un figlio di buona donna, e l'arresto è per il fatto presente.",0,1354473049,null,0,false,0,c7a3oxf,t3_143z30,t1_c7a3oxf,t1_c7a3awh,null,1430558384,0,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,0

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"I can answer this;

The EUs central tenet in international trade negotiations on agriculture is the idea of multifunctionality - that agriculture serves purposes beyond merely the commerce of food. These purposes boil down to;

1. Food security. Ensuring that in a time of increasingly uncertain weather (and hence agricultural production) patterns, there is enough agricultural production to feed its citizens. This has quite a bit of justification, in 2008 for example wheat prices rose 120% on the world markets prompting riots and looting in a number of developing (and undeveloped) cities. This was further exacerbated when some countries put in export bans to try and keep prices down. It's unknown how future political/trade scenarios will play out, particularly with global warming, and it's extremely difficult to build an agricultural base from scratch, so it's far more prudent to ensure the one in place survives in one way or another.

2. Rural development. The EU recognizes that rural towns represent a serious cultural(and to an extent economic) backbone of European nations. The CAP is the reason you see neatly tilled fields when you're driving through the French/German/What have you country side, rather than ex-agricultural land now overrun with weeds and disrepair. Furthermore, the EU recognizes that rural agricultural/cultural fairs are a serious part of a country's culture, and that such a way of life should be protected to ensure the cultural diversity of the European Union. Furthermore, there's the understanding that a good deal of ancillary rural jobs (the general jobs that keep a town functioning, like grocery stores, et cetera) would go bust if there was widescale agricultural labour reform. Keeping some aspect of the 'rural lifestyle' alive is an important part of the CAP, however in addition there's the point of a manageable transition of rural-&gt;urban labour. Family farms slowly being bought up by larger (and hence, more efficient) concerns means a steady trickle of population from rural areas to urban centers that doesn't destabilize society.  

3. Environmental Sustainability. A good deal of Europe's agricultural produce is economically profitable. The problem is, some of this is in environmentally sensitive areas - witness water stressed areas of Spain/Italy, or it isn't environmentally friendly. To this end, the EU helps our farmers that might otherwise have the freedom to damage the long term viability of land, but don't want to with assistance.

4. Food quality. Aside from the obvious, this is also heavily tied into the idea of environmental sustainability and packaging laws. An EU barometer poll found that this was an aspect of the CAP that people had a great deal of support for.

In addition, the EU committed itself at the 2005 Doha ministerial to eliminate all of it's export enhancing subsidies by 2013 (it is on track to do this, having cut down from the billions of euros to less than 150 million). 

Finally, most CAP subsidies promote either structural reform (for example, two thirds of the subsidies going to wine are there to change the agricultural land from wine, which is completely over saturated in the market, to profitable crops) or is part of the Single Payment Scheme which helps small farmers survive as their income is generally considerably less than what you'd get in a city. This also represents a movement away from the production based subsidies, which were considered the most trade distorting. Additionally, the CAP budget has been steadily decreasing for years now.

Obviously, there is some abuse of this system, but this is prevalent in most governmental policies around the world. It's also worth noting that other developed countries such as the US, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, et cetera, have similar schemes. Indeed, the CAP spends about the same amount of money or less per capita than the aforementioned nations, and not very dissimilar levels to what the 'efficient' agricultural producing developed countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Canada pay for their agricultural policies.

* Wait a beat before someone finishes speaking before saying something. It will feel like you're giving off ""OMG this is so boring I can't think of anything to say"" vibes. You're not. What you're doing is not interrupting them. This will come naturally pretty quickly.
* Don't hang around Americans and Brits. Seriously. You're there to learn German, so hang out with Austrians or - and this is more likely to happen since you're still learning the language - other exchange students who don't speak English.
* What int_0x80 means by ""non-running shoes"" are Oxfords or loafers. Wait until you're in Vienna to buy them. You may have to donate a kidney to pay for them. Do it anyway. You won't find the right shoes here in the US. Here's a typical selection from Germany: http://www.zalando.de/herrenschuhe-schnuerer/
* You will probably stick out anyway. That's fine. Learn the language as best you can. Do as many typical things as possible, even if it doesn't sound like the sort of thing you did for fun in the US (e.g. go to a Weihnachtsmarkt, go hiking in the forest, take a bike ride to see the local sights).  If you make friends with Austrians and they invite you to their house, accept. You'll learn ten times as much from interacting with their parents than you would learn otherwise.
* Finally, don't call anyone ""Du"" or call them by their first name unless they're younger than you or around your age, give or take 5-10 years. If they're older, they'll either officially ""invite"" you to call them Du (by saying something like, ""Du kannst schon 'Du' zu mir sagen"") or they'll unofficially invite you to call them ""Du"" by calling you ""Du"". Everyone is ""Sie"" and ""Herr/Frau XYZ"" until further notice.

DER PANTHER



Im Jardin des Plantes, Paris



SEIN Blick ist vom Vorübergehn der Stäbe

so müd geworden, daß er nichts mehr hält.

Ihm ist, als ob es tausend Stäbe gäbe

und hinter tausend Stäben keine Welt.





Der weiche Gang geschmeidig starker Schritte,

der sich im allerkleinsten Kreise dreht,

ist wie ein Tanz von Kraft um eine Mitte,

in der betäubt ein großer Wille steht.





Nur manchmal schiebt der Vorhang der Pupille

sich lautlos auf-. Dann geht ein Bild hinein,

geht durch der Glieder angespannte Stille -

und hört im Herzen auf zu sein.
