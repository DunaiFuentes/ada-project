It's difficult; this is an extraordinary achievement, and America should feel justly proud, and probably the people saying these things don't necessarily believe them whole-heartedly; they're trying to encourage funding by draping NASA in the American flag.

Staying at an apartment from airbnb is definitely the best way to go- check if breakfast is included in the price, and/or make sure you can use their kitchen. If you can use the kitchen and are thinking of eating in a few nights, there is a market called Picard which is a market devoted entirely to frozen meals-- all of which are affordable and much better quality than any frozen food I have had in the US. While food can be expensive in Paris, there are many good, cheap eats: crepes, sandwiches from the bakeries, falafel (go to rue des rosiers and try l'as du falafel). Also, if you take food to go it is almost always a few euros cheaper than if you eat at the restaurant! And of course, a picnic is a great way to go...you will have some of the best cheeses, breads, desserts, and wine for far less than you could ever find in the US- plus there are so many beautiful parks in Paris- my favorites are Parc des Buttes Chaumont and bois de vincennes, but the gardens are definitely worth checking out too- jardin du luxembourg and jardin des tuileries. 

If the weather is nice, try to walk as much as you can (especially if you find a place in a central location), and buy metro tickets in a bundle rather than individually as it is less expensive that way. If you like bicycling, try out the velibs-- there are stations all over the city and you can get a day pass for 1,70 euros plus it's a great way to see the city while you are going from place to place!",0,1344394315,null,0,false,0,c5psqrj,t3_x3kk3,t1_c5psqrj,t3_x3kk3,null,1429580541,1,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,1

I sincerely sympathise, because firstly the achievement is very impressive, and deserves praise, and secondly, this sort of nationalism is relatively common, but it becomes far more of an issue with America's geographical isolation, its self contained culture, and its massive military power.

I find it difficult to answer your question because you seem to assume that language public education more or less = language skills. When I wsa a teenager (I am now 34) it was in Hungary very much like computer skills: those who have to resort to learning it at school are losers (""lamers"", we called them in the early nineties, from the demoscene-jargon), every half-decent kid learns computer skills on his own, the same way you just pick up your English from computer games, cheap private teachers (university students looking for beer money), lyrics, reading fantasy novels in the original, the Internet and so on. And picking German from simply being in a German sphere of influence, tourism, grandparents, everything. My dad always went ""nicht vor dem Kind"" if they were talking secrets with my mom or grandma so I had to pick up German quickly to learn their secrets :)

Generally there is 1 language from the age of 10 up to high school and college. English is the most popular, followed by German. But I don't think anyone gets fluency just at school. Just like with math or physics classes, the knowledge lasts until the test/exam and then quickly deleted :)  It's all the other sources of learning that matter.

I was first taught Russian (we were still occupied) then German and Latin but I think people normally have only 1 but we had to have Latin because of being a chemistry and biology specialized high school class.

2. For me it was English around age 12, Danish around 14, German at 16.

3. Most people learn English, Danish and German. Three foreign languages are mandatory for any Gymnasium graduate.

4. Norwegian is more related to Icelandic, and so most Icelanders I know that have moved there have found it easy to learn it by immersion even as adults.

true,Eryemil,ESPA,Spain,"&gt;Are you saying all of them are horribly traumatized individuals? 

This is a strawman. Where did I say this? What I did say is that besides the obvious physical abuse component, practices like circumcision also involve psychological abuse because parents influence their children to accept the abuse as normal and pass it on to the next generation. 

&gt;and it is often (always?) done with anesthesia.

Wrong. You really shouldn't become involved in arguments if you don't have at least a basic grasp on the subject you're arguing about. 

The overwhelming majority of circumcisions are performed with no pain relief whatsoever and even when some pain relief is administered, it is not enough in the case of infant circumcision because babies are too sensitive to anesthesia. 

&gt;Female circumcision is designed to, and has the effect of, eliminating or severely reducing the woman's ability to feel sexual pleasure.

Google what people such as Kellogg and Maimonides had to say about male circumcision in respect to sexual satisfaction. That said, once again you're speaking from ignorance. ""Female circumcision"" is a very broad category. The more correct name would be female genital mutilation or female genital cutting and some forms of it are much less severe than male circumcision. 

&gt;After the risk of complications during the initial surgery, male circumcision is arguably harmless.

You mean, apart from the excruciating pain and loss of sexual function as well as all the problems it can lead to during adulthood? 

You have a very high threshold for what constitutes ""harm"".

When did I praise the CDU? Don't put words in my mouth.

The only interesting deviation I notice about these statistics is that Hauptschul- and Realschul graduates do not vote for the Greens. This doesn't mean that CDU voters are more stupid, it just means that green ideology doesn't appeal to workers. In higher education strata, the difference is negligible. 

Politics always boil down to class association and representation of interests. High earners are gonna want to vote for a party that promises lower taxes and less government spending, or they'll vote ideologically motivated, for parties like the Greens, because they are willing to trade off less income for ideals like sustainability, subsidization, eco awareness. 

No voter *in their right mind* elects representatives that represents conflicting interests. Or so we wish. The electorate of the Republican party in the US is known for being comprised of people that would be better of voting Dems for income purposes, but stick to them due to ideological and traditional reasons. (i.e. I come from a Republican family = I come from a Social Democrat family, etc.)

I can't be completely sure, maybe most people just thought the poster is funny, but this topic *does* have some hundred upvotes, i.e. I could argue that in fact I was *not* the only one who got this impression.

Third, and probably the most important point: my title perhaps should have made this more clear, but I mainly had reactions on reddit in mind, plus whatever glimpse of American mainstream media I saw in the last day or two. You mention:

&gt;I have not experienced anything even close to these sentiments, and I work at a major American research laboratory.

Look, not to sound condesceding, but it's hardly surprising that patriotism and flag waving is a bit less common in academia and research. 

What *does* strike me as a bit odd however is how even though you wrote  a long reply, you don't mention at all the stars&amp;stripes hair thing? I'm not hating on the US, or even flags in general, and it's not a big deal, but please understand that from my perspective, it certainly *looks* like there's more patriotism around the event this time. Could be for some other reasons (like someone else wrote above, planet exploration lends itself better to visceral pride than detection of hypothesized particles), but whatever the reason, I was and still am under the impression that no comparable patriotism surrounded the LHC event: the absolute minimum of EU flags, and that was that.

Now, again, you can argue that NASA is a different beast than CERN, and that particle researchers are perhaps different characters on average than engineers at a space agency, but all of that wouldn't change the perception that I described, right?

Trovo schifoso come tutti lo stiano massacrando per una questione come questa dove alla fine è praticamente certo che non gareggerà più, dovrà trovarsi un lavoro (e non conosco il suo curriculum, ma con l'aria da appestato che gli stanno dando non sarà facile) ed affrontare un processo. Mi sembra già abbastanza per uno che fino a prova contraria non ha ancora ammazzato nessuno.

E poi con una cattiveria da parte di tutti che fa veramente spavento.

Quella del Codacons, poi, nemmeno la sapevo. 

Tutto è un raccapricciante riassunto di Quelli Che Ben Pensano.

Ma c'è così tanto da stupirsi se uno costruisce delle aspettative enormi sopra un atleta che non se la sente fino in fondo e poi si scopre che questo cerca tutti gli aiuti possibili?

E non posso nemmeno biasimarlo per non aver detto a tutti ""Ma che cazo Folete Ta me? Io Foglio Zolo Tivertirmi!"", visto che tutti vogliono vincere e lo sperano fino alla fine.

Ecco, questo mi fa venire in mento [QUESTO](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=apOSlXioLNU#t=544s) documentario che riassume il mio pensiero sul doping e la forza devastante della domanda ""Do you wanna win?"". 

Ho frequentato tre diverse palestre in tre regioni italiane e di tre tipologie (La lurida, la fighetta, la universitaria) ed in tutte e tre c'era il pompatone che si sapeva che si siringava/si era siringato. Ed erano tutti ragazzi spinti non tanto da una persona in particolare, ma dalla voglia di soddisfare le aspettative di chi ti sta intorno. SEMPRE.

Reputo il doping un modo facile di barare al gioco e penso sia più salutare informare BENE sull'argomento gli sportivi e non (non il solito [predicone inutile e stronzo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G4HxrVx20A)). Far vedere magari [qualche filmato](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxBa_zcezdo) di vecchi calciatori ridotti a vegetali a 50 anni per le conseguenze di quello che hanno preso in gioventù. 

Vorrei incoraggiare i ragazzi a venir fuori e far salire questa merda piuttosto che mettere alla gogna e distruggere i pochi che vengono pizzicati. Specialmente se non mettono su il teatrino descritto in OP.

&gt; Brace yourself for the cliché quotation retort.

You asked for it.

&gt; That's demagoguery.

Bullshit. That's the truth. Stuff like April 25th is the exception, not the rule.

&gt; Libya is riddled with sectarian muslim extremists now. It's not a case of a convoluted post-revolution state. It's a case of tribal fragmentation of the country. But each tribe wants the rest of Libya for themselves too, and wants everyone else dead.

Assumptions. 

&gt; Gadafi was a way better option than that

You don't know that. You can say whatever you want when you have a comparable timeframe of the current political system.


&gt; Gadafi would have crushed these religious rebellions independent of their 'democracy and freedom sponsored by the west' propaganda and the rest of Libya would thank him for that. 

Again, you don't know that. Again, you're just making assumptions and conjectures.

&gt; You're avoiding the fact that the 'Libyan rebels' are various tribes of muslim extremists who want to restore an islamic theocracy in Libya, each group at the expense of the others. By avoiding this simple fact, you validate your argument that Gadafi is bad and anything that takes his place is better. But you're wrong. A revolution isn't always the right process for progressive and constructive change, especially a religion-driven 'revolution' gamed by western interests.

No, my argument is that Gaddafi is bad because he did bad things. In my whole text I ask you to point where I wrote that the current system is better than Gaddafi? That's right, I didn't. What I did wrote, is that Gaddafi isn't the lesser of two evils. It is too soon to pass judgements of value on the other 'evil'.

&gt; Edit: On this note, you might want to acknowledge that the west intervened in Libya for reasons that had nothing to do with the Libyan people's freedom and democratic universal rights.

This isn't my fucking point. I'll acknowledge whatever you want. Bush did bad things? Yes, he did. Bush was a dictator? No, he wasn't. The 'west' did blablabla? Sure, we did. Obama is literally Hitler? Sure, why not?

* The bank creates the money and gives it to S.
* S uses the money and finally repays the bank which destroys the money it had created before.
* However there was an interest rate attached, which means that another loan must be made to pay it.

In the end this cycle only works if there is inflation and a constant increase in the monetary mass. If the economy growth stalls the whole things collapses.

Not many people know that banks can create money, they do not only lend the money they have in deposits.

European banks must deposit 1% of their customer's deposits at the ECB. They can lend the other 99%.

This can theoretically appear to grow the money supply by a factor of 100 (easily calculated using a geometric series 1/1-0.99 = 100). This usually doesn't happen, because we don't only deposit money once we take out a loan, the actual factor is below 20. Keep in mind, there is no additional money, it's basically a balance sheet extension.

In different ways. Fine-touch sensitivity is something else. It adds breadth of sensation, it is what allows you to read braille with your fingertips but not your cockhead. Not all mechanoreceptors respond to the same type of stimulus. 

So, do you accept that the foreskin is the most *fine-touch* sensitive part of the penis?

No, not all of them. There are also studies where penile response is measured but the foreskin is ignored and only data for the parts of the penis that both parties possess are taken into account, which is obviously unfair, etc. 

There are also methodologically sound surveys of course, but at the end of the day they still rely on personal experience which will never be as good as objective measurements. As I said, my third point applies universally as these surveys are of men that *chose* to undergo circumcision which means they were already biased towards circumcision to begin with.

I give you that. But really, there are not more than different values in the USA altogether. Also I think its more to do with Georgia being more rural, while California is much more Urban! Argument invalid vs Germany!

Germany is much more prevailent in small business than the USA. Thus less brands. Thus more ""Brand"" Names overall. Argument invalid vs. Germany!

I'm not saying that other countries don't have cultural differences inside of them though. My point was mostly that the different states are akin to the different countries in Europe. Going from, for example, Belgium to Germany seems right on par.

Everyone is subject to bias whether they are activists or not, that includes you. As a circumcised man, for example, you're probably very eager to discount any evidence that would act as an attack against your sexual abilities but I didn't feel compelled to bring it up. 

Do you really want to make things personal? You've got a lot more invested in this subject than I do, even if I *am* an activist by the simple fact that you are irrevocably circumcised and will never have nay choice in the matter while I am an intact man. 

&gt; ""[...] orgasm intensity, and effort required for achieving orgasm through stimulation of specified areas around the glans and shaft of the penis, scrotum and anus [...]

That is what the above study measured; it has nothing to do with fine-touch sensitivity. 
Please find me an article that measures fine-touch sensitivity between intact and circumcised penises or concede that the intact penis is more sensitive to this particular type of sensation. 

&gt;while objective measurements can be statistically significant, they need not reflect on experiences in real life.

That's a pretty bold claim. If objective data weren't indicative then science as we know it wouldn't be possible. You're basically saying that hearsay is more valid than hard data in every possible instance. 

Surveys have their place in science obviously but areas where the topic is subject to high emotional investment such as this is not one of them. 

**Also, and for the third fucking time: all these self-reported studies are biased from the beginning by the simple fact that they only represent the views of men that *chose* to become circumcised which indicates a preference or need for circumcision.

Same thing here. Northern California is quite similar to Oregon, Southern California does it's own thing, and eastern California is more similar to rural Arizona or Nevada.

&gt; In a matter of culture you can't quite compare countries of Europe to states in the US. It doesn't quite work that way. Just look at the timeline of things. Areas and landmarks in Europe have changed in the past so much more than the US ones.

I would say that the constant flux of borders and controlling powers in Europe have led to a situation very similar to that of the United States where the culture can, to an extent, cross nation or state boundaries. The difference being that the United States has been moving *away* from their common culture(of 150 years ago or so when we spread into different/more isolated states), and Europeans have been moving *towards* their common culturewith History's various invasions/takeovers/spheres of influence, and the formation of the EU.",0,1344436797,null,0,false,0,c5pzuay,t3_xti4q,t1_c5pzuay,t1_c5pzmlh,null,1429583958,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

I don't think nations should be spending so much money on military if they can't pay for it and are not in a war. 

While Czechia is definitely underdeveloped in comparison to western countries even here are heard voices that want to implement taxes for the rich. And you would be surprised but Czechia has plenty of nuclear power, we are even supplying neighboring countries with it.

The main issue here is the motivation. Rich people buy things, build things and sponsor things, you can imagine what an attack on their motivation to do these things these taxes are. France is already getting money from VAT tax, excise tax and so on.

So if rich people start buying less, companies who used to make things rich people were buying might start firing people. As these workers become unemployed they will stop paying taxes and they will be getting money from the state.

“I would rather obey a fine lion, much stronger than myself, than two hundred rats of my own species.”
― Voltaire

""Monarchy can easily be debunked, but watch the faces, mark well the debunkers. These are the men whose taproot in Eden has been cut: whom no rumour of the polyphony, the dance, can reach - men to whom pebbles laid in a row are more beautiful than an arch. Yet even if they desire mere equality they cannot reach it. Where men are forbidden to honour a king they honour millionaires, athletes or film stars instead: even famous prostitutes or gangsters. For spiritual nature, like bodily nature, will be served; deny it food and it will gobble poison.""
   
-C S Lewis.

""The monarchical principle is laughed at by vulgar and foolish people in all the suburbs of Europe. It is hated in all the gutters of the world. The reason is simple. It enshrines with a fitting dignity and elaboration the principle of authority as something independent of this or that politician. It places it above attack. It symbolises and consecrates an attitude of mind essential to the happiness of peoples.""
  
-D’Alvarez, Storm Over Europe, by Douglas Jerrold (1930), Chapter XII.

""Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and a member of the European Parliament: He is the man who can cause an uproar in the otherwise dull European Parliament, where he called the Lisbon Treaty ""the most spectacular, bureaucratic coup d'etat that the world had ever seen."" He has described European Council President Herman Van Rompuy as having the ""charisma of a damp rag."" His remarks have had the desired effect. The UKIP did well in recent local elections in England and prominent Tories have defected to his party. In the polls, UKIP is just behind the Liberal Democrats who are part of Britain's coalition government. As a result, Farage is becoming an increasing problem for Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives. ""

true,Mordeth,NETH,The Netherlands,"Imagine a desolate war-torn African country. A farmer ekes out a living on his small farm, with this wife and two kids. After yet another failed harvest, his kids are now slowly dying of malnutrition.

But a small miracle happens: for the first time in that nation's history, people get to vote for their new leader.  There are two options: the GoodGuy, an intellectual who has drawn up realistic plans to end the conflict and build up the nation; and there's the Warlord, under whose leadership there will never be peace nor prosperity.

Both ask the farmer to vote for him. The GoodGuy shows him that under his leadership, the nation and everyone living in it will prosper in just 10 years time. Bad news is: both his sons will already have starved to death by then.  The Warlord also comes along. He merely states to give the farmer a sack of grain if he votes for him. The farmer's kids will be saved, although their and everyone else's future will remain uncertain.

By your reckoning, MattD420, that country has now ""democracy"". Farmer guy can vote, right?

Wrong. It's not democracy, because the farmer is not free to vote as he would like. He has no choice but to vote for the Warlord if he wants his kids to live.

Democracy requires more than just ""voting"". It requires a society wherein all the pillars that support democracy are in place: the rule of law, so that all people are protected from harm; worker's rights, so that employees can operate free from their employers; a free and diverse press, so that people can be informed about the situation, its backgrounds and options; an education populace, so that people can interpret the facts on their own and are able to make their own conclusions; basic human rights, etc etc.   

Democracy is the RESULT of such ordered society. It's a TOOL designed to keep that society running. It requires constant vigilance by its people, and not just once every X years.

You cannot bring democracy to a war-torn desolate country, just by giving its people the vote. It has to stop being a war-torn desolate country first.

true,Marogian,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; This usually doesn't happen, because we don't only deposit money once we take out a loan, the actual factor is below 20. 

Uh, no, we do- we take out a loan and then we spend it. The receiver of the cash we spent the money on then deposits it in a bank. Or spends it. Whatever, it will always end up in a bank and will always be seen as another deposit (which can then be loaned out again) despite being a loan in the first place.

The reason the money supply doesn't grow so rapidly isn't because we don't deposit loans in banks but because there's a limit point because of the [money multiplier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier) which is essentially dependent on the reserve rate (not the 1% you have to deposit at the ECB). But this doesn't mean the money supply is stable all the time- its **only** stable if we're ALWAYS lending and borrowing at maximum capacity. If we ever stop lending or borrowing at maximum capacity the money supply will decrease and there literally won't be enough money to service the sum total of debt...because its all created money.

Fractional Reserve Banking is *entirely* dependent on continually lending and borrowing. When this behaviour stops (kinda what's been happening recently) the system falls like a stack of dominoes.

Chinese in particular has become a hot subject these last years with the number of classes growing rapidly.

Yup.

Only in rural areas for the most part..and moreso in the south.

Yeah. It's a little complicated but overall is hard to argue with.

To an extent. Hockey for example, is more popular in the midwest and (American) football is more popular in the South. It's watched everywhere, but the south is particularly intense about it. We do seem to have a universal apathy towards European Football/Soccer.

Anyway, here in Italy:

1 and 2 - It all depends on the education path a student decides to follow. In general, during Elementary school (grade 1 to 5) the first compulsory foreign language (~~almost~~ always English) is introduced: the emphasis is on vocabulary and key sentences rather than grammar, in order to have the kid grow familiar with the language.

The study of English continues through Middle school (grade 6 to 8) - with more emphasis given to grammar and reading/speaking/listening, now that the student is supposedly familiar with the language - and a second compulsory language is added: it's usually either French, Spanish or German (it depends on what your school offers). The focus is mostly on grammar.

As for high school (grade 9 to *13* - yes, here it lasts 5 years, much to my dismay), it all depends on what type of high school a student chooses to attend. There are three types of high school: *licei* (the traditional path for those who want to go to University), technical institutes (with more practical teachings, but they still enable you to continue with university) and professional institutes (where you learn a job, basically); each type is then divided into several sub-divisions, according to the curricula offered. Now, while English remains compulsory until the end of high school regardless of its type (with the addition of English literature from grade 11 to 13), the study of a second and third foreign language depends on the high school chosen. Latin is compulsory in all *licei* for 5 years (the first two years are dedicated towards the study of grammar, the other three towards the study of Latin literature). In classical *licei* Ancient Greek is also compulsory for 5 years. Some *licei* offer you the possibility to study a second modern foreign language (most commonly the one started in Middle school, usually for 5 years including literature), and in linguistic *licei* the study of a third modern foreign language is compulsory for three years. The same goes for some technical institues.

To be accepted into University, a certain knowledge of English is necessary - ranging from B1 to C1, since it varies according to the field of your choice - and so you have to sit a test to assess your English skills, unless you already have an ESOL certification. Unless you're studying Modern Languages or similar things, you're not required to study another language - you can, though, and it provides credits.

3 - English is compulsory everywhere. French, Spanish and German (in that order) are the most studied second foreign languages - but some schools also offer Russian, Chinese, Arabic, Portuguese and Japanese. And Latin and Ancient Greek, of course.

4 - Some (private) schools offer their whole curriculum in English, from grade 1 to 13. They're great if you want to learn English well, but as far as the other subjects go they're not so good. Like every private school in Italy, to be honest: they're easier than public schools, and are usually attended by rich snobs who don't feel like spending too much of their time studying.

My experience: I studied English from grade 1 to 13, and can use it rather well - well, certainly better than all of my high school classmates - only because I've been using it *outside* school for 6-7 years (reading, watching TV, Internet... the list goes on). The English of those of my classmates/friends who only use it at school is awkward at best. In Middle school I studied French; I still can understand it a bit, but as far as grammar and vocabulary go my memory is blank. In High school I took Latin for 5 years: with a dictionary and a bit of effort I can still translate from Latin to Italian/English, but my knowledge of grammar is quickly fading.

The Henry Tax Review in Australia took two years just to formulate, let alone implement. It's unrealistic to expect the Greeks to have been able to do the same in other areas of the Greek government as well and stick to the deadline for budget cuts.

The old austerity measures, of having targets that needed to be reached, was clearly a very poor one. Instead of bringing about real and lasting reform, it just set arbitrary budget reduction targets that didn't address any of the structural problems at hand and the Greek government was forced to play to this schedule. One of the only things that will keep the eurozone alive for the crisis to pass is debt mutualization, because frankly at the moment the bond yields in the Southern economies are crippling.

that said, one thing i can definitely recommend though is going up the Tour Montparnasse once the sun goes down. then the city lights up and looks beautiful from the top. i took a girl up there that had never been to Paris, and she had no idea what to expect until we actually got there and she started to catch on (i gave her no hints at all), and she just absolutely loved it. it ended up being the perfect way to start off a brief stint in Paris. 

is it a little cliche? probably. but she liked it. i'd imagine the girl you're crazy about would too.

The tax rate is progressive, ie for each section of income, you pay a certain rate:

0-5000€/year : 0
5000€-10000€/year: 2.5% 
...

In such a system, a person who makes 5001€/year pays 0.02€ tax, where as a person who makes 10000€/year pays 125€ tax.

The point that has gotten the 0.01% up in arms is the fact that a new level is going to be added, so that income in excess of 1M€ (ONE MILLION EUROS) per year will be imposed at 75%

This means that up to 1M€/year, nothing changes but if you earn 1M€+1€, that 1€ will give 0.75€ in taxes.

In practice this doesn't change much, since only 15000-20000 people actually earn that much (in a country of 75M people).

What it does change is that it puts everyone in the same boat as far as fighting the deficit is concerned, as opposed to the last 10 years where the middle class was hammered, and the rich got tax breaks 'because of the trickle down effect'.

As far as punishing success is concerned, let's just say that things are evened out differently. When you factor in health insurance etc, most French people pay less in contributions as Americans, the exception being the ultra rich. The benefits system is built on the as needs basis (ie no one will be refused medical care, or subsistence), but being on the doll is no fun I can attest to that.

When I used to go to school (I'm 22 now), you'd start learning English in 5th grade, a second foreign language (German, French, Italian) in 1st grade high school, and an additional one in college.

Now:

1. At least 3 foreign + latin, 4 + 1 if you go to college

2. 1st grade elementary, so when you're 6 or 7 years old.

3. English is mandatory through your education. In 5th grade you get the option of picking between several, though German and French are always offered, along with Italian, Spanish, Russian, etc (depending on the school). I'd say that the split between French and German is about 50:50, though I think German is a bit more prevalent because of the economic ties.

4. Believe it or not, Serbia has the minority issue regulated quite well. Schools in Vojvodina (Northern Serbia) are often taught in the languages of the minorities (there are Hungarian schools, high schools, even colleges, but also Slovak, Rusin, Vlach, etc, so just like in Romania). In Southern Serbia (and no, not in Kosovo), there are schools in Albanian. Learning Serbian is still required though. When Kosovo was still Serbia, even Serbs living there were required to take Albanian throughout their education. I'm not sure if people in Vojvodina or South Serbia are now required to take the languages of the minorities though, I don't think so.

&gt;Selbst länger andauerndes bzw. mehrfaches Hupen, um den anderen zu einem bestimmten Verhalten (Weiterfahrt, zügigeres Fahren, Freigabe der Fahrbahn etc.) zu veranlassen, wird ohne Hinzutreten erschwerender Umstände in aller Regel nicht als Nötigung zu bewerten sein. Für die Annahme von Gewalt hat die Einwirkung nicht die notwendige Intensität. Aus demselben Grund wird keine Drohung mit einem empfindlichen Übel vorliegen; denn der besonnene Verkehrsteilnehmer wird dem (schlüssig) in Aussicht gestellten Nachteil weiteren Hupens standzuhalten in der Lage sein (vgl. OLG Düsseldorf NJW 1996, 2245). Das Gleiche gilt für die Betätigung der Lichthupe. Zum Einsatz von Signalhorn und Lichthupe, um dem „Drängeln“, namentlich auf der Autobahn, größeren Nachdruck zu verleihen, oben Rn. 29 ff.

I must admit, I understood 'ppl born with defects' as ppl that actually suffer from a condition, not as someone who might have a recessive gene for something. But the alternative interpretation makes little more sense to me:

In the scenario you suggest, the sheer loss of biodiversity of our species, loss in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosis , if preventing the reproduction (as with killing) of ppl with any recessive trait we can presumably agree is unambiguously harmful (in no ways a given, since as with cases of sickle cell anaemia, many such traits may be advantageous in certain contexts, and the question of 'net worth' of an individual gene is further complicated with having many different genes shape most characteristics, each gene having many other consequences) is no doubt much worse an effect than a gain would be from preventing a few simple or even single-gene afflictions.

If eugenics should be tried again, I think the scientifically sounder way is something like the Gattaca scenario, where you screen embryos for the undesired qualities, to the extent those are well mapped to a genetic profile. Merely preventing the reproduction of individuals is at best a project that would take millennia to do anything. And even more if it's to accomplish much.

&gt;The Portuguese people vote for their government and their parliament. All parties present a candidate for Prime Minister and representatives for Parliament. Each voter votes on one of these parties, and whichever gets more votes, gets to the government.

This is not true sorry. You vote for a party on your electoral circle, depending on the number or voters, the circle gets a certain number or appointments to the Parliament. Depending on the votes each party gets, that party gets a number or people who were previously listed. What happens after the Legislative Elections is that the President calls the leaders of the parties with seats on the Parliament and after consideration appoints a Prime-Minister to form a government. This PM is traditionally the leader of the party with most sits on the Parliament, but it's not mandatory. The President can call ANYONE to be PM. The problem is that the PM answers to the President **and** the Parliament, and it must implement the laws the parliament passes. Can you imagine how chaotic it would be to run the Government without the support of the Parliament? Or with threats of Votes of No Confidence on a weekly basis? To ensure stability, the President just **invites** the leader of a party (usually the one with most seats) to be PM. 

&gt;The Portuguese people also vote for their President who has the power to either veto or sign every new laws and has the power to 'fire' any government. Incrdibly, this power has never been abused of. It has happened two times, both in the last decade, both because the governments sucked (and 'sucked' state money to useless and destructive policies and measures).

Some what wrong. The president can only ""fire"" a government in case of ""crisis"" that was made by said government, or if there's a social shift so big that is clear that the *deputados* don't represent the people anymore. This is because after the government takes power, it takes to the Parliament the ""program of government"" that is accepted by the newly elected *deputados*. This is what gives any government legitimacy. If you get a government without an approved ""program"" you can get it fired by the President.

&gt;Those I vote for always keep their word. They're known by those who respect them as being tenacious, coherent, stubborn and full of integrity. Among their enemies, they're know for being inflexible, pesky and uncollaborative of the great debt market capitalists (not free market, even if they say so) ruling all over our mighty democracies of Europe.

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I'm a Eurosceptic by nature in case you're not aware of that :-) 

One of my biggest gripes about the EU has always been the evident holes in its governance and this includes what we have seen over the last 20 years which is basically the EU using money where the US used soldiers. 

As the EU has pushed east to embrace former Soviet states it has turned a massive blind eye to the levels of corruption and evident in both the South and East. EU funds were pissed against the wall and everyone was happy because ""everyone"" felt rich and the EU didn't have to deal with too many awkward poor places with a pissed off population. 

Within the EU countries have been able to flout the laws, anything from common market laws to actual treaty obligations with no punishment whatsoever. What is worse is that some of the main rulebreakers have been the fonuding members - Germany and France.

So inspired by their lead other countries have not undertaken the necessary reforms, not reined in the corruption and not prepared for a rainy day. 

The eurozone crisis was always a crisis of ""when"" rather than ""if"" and naturally it needs something to start it, in this case the financial crisis of 2008. 

The galling thing is that most of this was entirely preventable or at least containable had the ""elites"" engaged in honest debate with the populace and sought to marry very different cultures together in the good times. Instead politicians got on with their own thing, buying votes with EU money and looking pretty on the international stage.

So now, here we are in one shitty dilemma: bow to the inevitable and force through a United States of Europe which, judging by the press, would be as popular as a fart in a jacuzzi so in all likelihood it will lack all democratici legitmacy unless some FUD is spread throughout the population first (Greece being the sacrificial lamb?)

Or, the Euro essentially breaks up and the political construct is effectively destroyed in its current form. One would hope the good bits would be retained but I daresay protectionist instincts would kick in.

So yes, to answer your question it would require a big kind of interference in national sovereignty and one on a personal level I would be against. However, given how things are the EU needs to do something to fight for its life because the concept of a USE has some merit as a counterweight to China and probably India one day.

Sadly we seem all too good at sowing the seeds of our own destruction, but I shall leave this as it is a very long and different debate.

It would take generations because well let's look at the probably outcomes to this crisis:

 1 . Debt mutalisation - one way or another this will mean the creditor and richer countries shouldering the debt. Even now we can see Greece struggling and a very real human cost to the crisis. Debt mutalisation will not solve that, it may soften it but Greece and others will have to endure years of relative hardship, this creates resentment.

We've already seen suggestions on all sides for a breakup and the anti-eurozone party did quite well in Greece. Such a clash of cultures will take a long time to die down. 

And more to the point the need to force through changes will mean there is little democratic involvement because if there is then we'll have the usual banana republic farce of having votes until the ""right"" answer is given.

 2 . The status quo - well this wont last too long, I'd be impressed if things can continue like this for much longer a year maybe 2 but lets assume the world picks up and manages to carry the EU with it. 

As things stand now the politicians and the media are making very national cases without arguing for the ""greater"" good that the EU represents. Germany (and hopefully the UK) would argue for better law and better regulation but this would be fought quite strongly in the lot of the PIGS simply as that is what their culture knows.

Very soon it would be back to tit for tat political treaties which either fail to deal with underlying problems or whose requirements are ignored. The evidence for this behaviour can be seen over the last 20 years.

 3 . The Eurozone breaks up - one would hope that the EU would remain intact but it would be a shitstorm and no mistake I'd daresay one or 2 of the countries which come out worse off have a revloution or two. Maybe if the richer nations throw money at them they may survive, but if they have the money to throw they'd probably do that to save the Euro.

 4 . The ECB continues to be lender of last resort - just dont tell anyone! This is the cowardly way out so sadly all too likely! This represents the total abdication of responsibility of the political classes and is very much an EU I dont want to be a part of.

An international  treaty is understandings based on mutual trust, not enforceable or binding and it's strength lies in that all parties benefit from having everybody follow it. It is more of a contract than a law, and until the advent of supra-national organizations was more of a gentlemans agreement than a contract, and in many ways this is still the case. If all parties choose to ignore an agreement, the agreement is void, and this is how they die off. I don't think there has ever been a meeting to annul an international or diplomatic agreement.

   It's very confusing using the Maastricht Treaty as if it could be brought to a court of law, it's not how it works. It can only be used for political points now, something which no one is doing. 

   And this is exactly why something like the EU was created and needed, to serve as a court for such agreements, but the Maastricht Treaty is not under it's auspices since it was created outside its systems of governance.

Obesity costs Americans tons of money - taxes nonetheless and if Americans are so upset about their taxes, loosing weight will lead to reduction in overall tax pressure as less obesity related health care is needed and the money can be used to treat people with real illnesses and not I-ate-my-fat-ass-into-a-hospital-type of illnesses!

Thanks for the post. I don't mean to be too combative, but I've never understood this narrative. When have France or Germany done anything dramatic against their interests for the good of Europe? To pick out some obvious counter-examples, France has for decades paid less per capita, because it gouges the CAP to subsidise its apparently deliberately inefficient agricultural sector, Germany has fought against opening up its certification systems which exclude foreign workers with non-German qualifications. Arguably, when Britain argues for reform Fisheries policy, cuts to the CAP, with the money rerouted to regional investment, or completion of the single market, it is acting in the interests of Europe, as well as in its own interests. I'd say that Europe is at its best when it is about shared interest, rather than expecting sacrifice for the common good (which never materializes anyway) and these morality tales about Britain's role are little more than tales for children.

Anyway, I would genuinely be interested to hear these examples of countries acting against their interest for the good of Europe. It could well be poor media coverage in Britain or simple ignorance on my part.",0,1344530387,null,0,false,0,c5qkvn9,t3_xxt8n,t1_c5qkvn9,t1_c5qilvq,null,1429594099,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13
