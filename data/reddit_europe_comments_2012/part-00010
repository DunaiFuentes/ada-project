RE: Recent [post](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16708340) on a BBC article on how ""Antisemitism is Haunting Germany.""  There was a small side discussion on the meaning of ""haunt"" in the context of the BBC piece.  

I actually thought ""haunt"" was a good way to characterize the issue.  It covers both any current actual incidences of antisemitism as well as collective guilt about the atrocities of the Nazi era.  But in either case, my comment was about semantics, not about antisemitism.  And to the extent antisemitism is being discussed on /r/germany, it is ""haunting"" /r/germany.

The OP HERE clearly doesn't understand what passive-aggressive means, which several other commentators also pointed out.  It is a technical psychological description of a type of behavior pathology.  Antisemitism is not ""passive"" aggressive (indirect aggression), it is more direct or overt aggression to the extent that it is focused against other people.  Again, I was addressing this as a semantic issue regarding the use of the term ""passive-aggressive"" rather than about antisemitism.

I don't see anything wrong with a Norwegian PM apoligizing for this, but I don't see anything wrong it not doing so either. It was a good gesture.

If Soviet had invaded the US, put the commuinst party (http://www.cpusa.org/) in the US as a dictatorship, and that goverment starting sending enemies of the state to Siberia on the orders of Soviet, would you blame the average American population who hated this puppet regime? Would a post-liberated US goverment have any blame? Would their grandchildren 60 years after? Of course not. 

If the king of Norway had given its blessing to this new regime, that would have changed things, but the royal family went to exile in England.

The bold things fall under under illegally acquiring copyrighted material, which is illegal. The italic things fall under illegally distributing copyrighted material, which is also illegal. Now, streaming is in a grey area because there are contradicting court rulings on the matter. Some courts argue that streaming technically does not qualify as acquiring, whereas others either a) say that by downloading it into the cache of your computer, you are acquiring it or b) consider the question whether you ""acquire"" it irrelevant because in their opinion viewing the work without paying constitutes a copyright violation on it's own (this is grossly simplified.)

I am not entirely sure what happens if you, say, use an English proxy to use catchups on BBC and if there even are rulings for that.

**SPON column, the black channel** [The black channel used to be a communist propaganda show in East-Germany, but is also the traditional color of our conservatives, hence, teh trolling is programmatic]

**Italian Hit-and-Run**

A column by Jan Fleischhauer

The character of peoples is an invention of yesterday, we already learn at school that clichees about nations have been put out-of-service. But is that so? Untimely thoughts on occasion of the 
odyssey of an Italian captain.

Be honest: Is anyone surprised that the disaster-captain of the ""Costa Concordia"" is Italian? Can anybody imagine, that such a maneuver including subsequent hit-and-run would have happened to a
German or let's say, British captain?

One knows this type from the beach vacation: a man with large gestures and speaking fingers. Harmless in principle, but you shouldn't let him handle heavy machinery, as it show. Making ""Bella figura"" is
an Italian mass sport, which is all about impressing others. Francesco Schettino wanted to make a good figure, too, unfortunately, there was a rock in his way.

Okay, this was very incorrect. We have been long been stopped to reach for cultural stereotypes in judgment of our neighbors. This is regarded as hillbilly, or worse racist (although, it is not totally clear how the Italian is its own race).

The national character is like the difference between the genders. Technically, it has already been abandoned, but in every day life, we encounter it all the time. You just have to spend an afternoon in the Kindergarten, to doubt everything the enlightened pedagogy teaches about gender as social construct. Actually, a whole shadow industry lives off the difference of Mars and Venus [oh the irony to cite teh roman gods here] and how to best cope with it. The counterpart to such efforts is the travel guide, which introduces us to the peculiarities and therefor typology of foreign cultures.

**Somehow, medially, the Hun is still in us**

Especially the Germans have a problem with cultural attributions. The Brit, for example, don't think we're exceptionally gifted in humor -- in spite of comic giants like Mario Barth [popular yet pretty unfunny German comedian] or, attention political satire, Hagen Rether. The French then again make fun of the English cuisine and the Belgians about the alleged stinginess of the dutch.

We only now the character of people in its negative variant, as self-accusation. The minute some youths shout stupid slogans, conflict scientist Wilhelm Heitmeyes surfaces in the press and explains
why social peace is in danger (""explosive situation"") and that a relapse is coming any moment now.

Some how the Hun is medially still with us, ready to strike; somehow that always works.

One doesn't have to try genetics to get to the view that nations differ. There are climatic reasons for it, language plays a role, too. Usually this is not very important, one shouldn't try to justify policies by claiming that borders only matter in indirectly. The currency crisis, which got ignored in the last weeks because the man in the castle [German press was very busy with a scandal surrounding our president] grabbed everyones attention, shows what happens if one ignores the psychology of a people for political reasons. The rock in front of the ship is here the interest
rate of the market.

**Birth-defect of the Euro? The straight-jacket for different cultures**

When there's talk about the different capacity of countries everywhere now, it's a way of saying how certain clichees have a justification in a way that strips off all offense. The birth defect of the 
Euro was to force different cultures into the straitjacket of a common currency.

To recognize how this couldn't have succeeded one did not have to study political economy, a visit in Napoli or Peloponnese would have been enough. Now one is looking imploringly for a solution. The answer of the chancelorette is to make everyone like us; one will see how far she gets with that.

Nations can change, therein lies consolation if one wants to see it. The Italians commanded a world empire 2000 years ago which reached from England to Africa. The Germans are now struggling to keep
trains running in snow and ice. It takes a long time for some clichees wear off. Sometimes it takes generations.

For alternative learning, I recommend the following strategy: buy your favorite children's/young adult books and their audiobook companions translated into German.  Take it slow, looking up words you don't know.  For instance, listen for two pages while reading along in the book and underlining words you don't know.  Pause the audiobook, look up the words, then read the section out loud yourself.

I did this with all seven harry potter books, went from B1 to advanced C1 over the course of a year (to be fair, I was in Berlin for three months of that time, but I only went from probably beginning B2 to advanced B2/beginner C1 in that time period, and I was also reading Harry Potter while I was here).  Reading the books aloud myself helped my accent a ton - if you don't want to do it for whole sections, definitely try to do it for dialogue.  It gives you a good sense of conversational language.  After I read through all the books once and knew I was going to be moving back to Germany, I started just listening to the audiobooks whenever I was walking somewhere.

You can buy the books on Amazon, I torrented the audiobooks because they were insanely expensive.  Although, you can get them now from amazon.de for 84 euros total, which is still expensive, but way less than when I was looking a year and a half ago: http://www.amazon.de/Harry-Potter-Das-gro%C3%9Fe-H%C3%B6rbuch/dp/3867177627/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327781377&amp;sr=8-1

Title

&gt; **Do these sex-boxes corrupt our children?**

Subtitle:

&gt; *Even four-year-olds will occupy themselves with the ideas of desire and love*

Photo caption:

&gt; *Plush vaginas, wooden penises, and videos which leave little to the imagination: At these Swiss schools, this offensive collection is presented. Soon it could be obligatory. However, now opposition is forming against the hedonistic material.*

Article:

&gt; Recently, boxes were distributed to thirty schools and kindergartens in the county of Basel. They have this stuff in them.

&gt; The big box has been put together specifically with the little ones in mind. It's contents: Dolls, puzzles, books and other teaching materials for four to ten year-olds. 

&gt; The older children peer curiously into that box: It has film-material for sex education, wooden penises of every imaginable length and thickness, plus an artificial vagina. Enclosed is also a guide for teachers. It explains how the materials cater to the proper age brackets. When the container is opened in the classroom, it's time to speak about a sensitive topic: sex.

&gt; The bag and the box are to serve as resources for the teacher in sex-ed. As of the beginning of this school-year, sex-ed is on the curriculum - just like mathematics and gymnastics - and it is mandatory. No child can be exempted from it.

&gt; What a four-year-old can look forward to after the summer break, is a lot: The small citizens of Basel will learn to differentiate and name female and male body parts - including the genitals. They will learn how a baby is born.  For this purpose, the sex-suitcase provides explicit pictorial material and dolls for practicing.

&gt; The catch-word ""delight"" is very important. Knee-high tots should ""recognise that touches on areas of the body can be pleasurable,"" explains Daniel Schneider. He is the deputy superintendent of kindergartens of the county of Basel and he drafted the guidelines, along with other professionals.

&gt; In practice, it can look like this: The children massage each other reciprocatively - or touch each other with warm sandbags. For this purpose, soft music plays in the background. It's important that they learn to say no, if they don't want to be touched in a certain place on their bodies."" Schneider believes that ""Children should be supported in this manner and relish developing and experiencing their sexuality.""

&gt; Even the much-loved children's sport of ""playing doctor"" is given quasi-official status, in the doctrine of these professionals. ""For children of this age-range to feel that inclination, is normal. One must not create a disconnect - because it can negatively affect their development,"" said Schneider, himself a former kindergarten teacher.

&gt; In the higher grades, things get more explicit. Educational videos and vaginas made out of a plush material are a part of the educational program, just like the wooden penises.

&gt; It's not only Basel's students who  are becoming uninhibited about the subject of sex. It also is occurring in parts of St. Gallen county, and in the district of Appenzell.
In many schools in those regions, the so-called ""sex-carpet"" is well known. This is a colorful collage made out of paper scraps inscribed with bawdy terms written by the kids. They read them aloud during the sex-ed hour - ""ficken"" [to fuck, screw, or shag], ""bumsen"" [to hump, fuck, or boink], ""knallen"" [to pop] are among the least offensive of the terms.

&gt; ""By reading aloud, the children come to sense that words can offend, but that they can also delight. We encourage them to use whichever words release pleasurable emotions."" says Pius Widmer, (62) theologian and sexual educator at the ""Center for AIDS and Sexual Matters"" in St. Gallen. She is called upon by the schools to come in and help with educational work in the two districts.


&gt;  Basel city and the other two eastern Swiss counties are the first places which are implementing this aggressive sexual education program, which begins at kindergarten age. However, the rest of Switzerland is awaiting 2014 - when the introduction of ""Curriculum 21"" begins, a nationwide government mandated mandatory sex-ed program. Currently, a committee of teachers and specialists in the field are preparing the foundational concepts for this. The Director of Education will have the last word; she must approve the program before it is implemented.

&gt; Independently, the Ministry of Health has allowed a white paper on ""anchoring sexual education in the schools"" to be hammered out. Experts from the Pedagogical University of Central Switzerland were assigned to this task. It has emerged from contracts made available to SonntagsBlick [the paper this news article was published in] that the Ministry of Health has paid 1,343,000 Swiss Francs for this project.

&gt; The sweeping forty-five page document is intended to help the Swiss counties work out their guidelines. Basel is the first district to have developed its sex-ed curriculum based on these recommendations.

&gt; Meanwhile, massive resistance is forming against the mandatory sex-ed curriculum. In many counties, parents, teachers, and other pedagogs are holding meetings. Their goal is to prevent its introduction. Daniel Trappitsch, who is a sex therapist and member of the association ""Citizens for Citizens"" which acts on behalf of dozens of critics from all quarters, is appalled. He says, ""Such teaching is scandalous. Sex-ed is responsibility of parents.""

&gt; The critics are receiving support from some members of parliament.  Especially conservative and bourgeois politicians are irritated. Christian Democratic Party MP Segmüller says he has ""nothing against a civilised sex-ed program."" The proposed sexual education curriculum, however is ""something that is close to perversity."" According to this former commander of the Swiss Guard, sex-ed has absolutely no place in kindergarten classrooms. ""The Ministry of Health, in its zeal, is pushing ahead with these changes too quickly,"" he complains.

&gt; Free Democratic Party faction chief Gabi Huber is also astonished, ""Sex-ed in this form should remain the purview of parents and certainly does not belong in kindergarten classrooms,"" says the woman from Uri. She does not believe that Basel and St. Gallen-style lessons will be implemented in Uri, and she urges the county's educational directors, ""not to tolerate such a program.""

&gt; Proponents and opponents are waiting eagerly on the decision: By 2014, the education directors want to agree to a mandatory program that anchors sexual education into the curriculum of Swiss schools.

&gt; Ulrich Schlüer, of the ""Zurich People's Party National Council,"" wants to prevent exactly that. He has organised the national campaign against an education, ""that borders on pornography."" This movement insists that the wishes of families and teachers are being ignored.

&gt; Schlüer says that he has emerged as the coordinator of diverse parents' organisations, and also represents disaffected teachers from across the political spectrum. ""The campaign of resistance is massive. Daily, new critics add themselves to our ranks,"" says the Zurich People's Party man. Next month, he will lay out for the public a series of measures with which they can combat the offensive sex-education curriculum proposal.

&gt; Some school officials protest the massive wave of criticism. The Basel school physician Thomas Steffen, for example, who issued guidelines for his county says, ""Children will have the right to age appropriate instruction. The taboo which is made out of the subject is only a problem for the adults.""

&gt; Both the Federal Office of Public Health and the Pedagogical University of Central Switzerland in Lucerne declined to comment on the planned sexual ed curriculum. 

The grey box at the bottom of the page is titled...

&gt; This is in the controversial paper

and it reads...

&gt; On behalf of the Federal Office of Public Health, experts from the Pedagogical University of Central Switzerland in Lucerne have written a whitepaper regarding anchoring sexual education in the public schools. *The schools must explain to the "" * "" and convey "" *,"" write the experts.* [[see barsoap's comment for the translation of this sentence](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/ozwvh/sex_education_in_switzerland/c3lobdv)]

&gt; It is important that the personal and social aspects of sexuality not be portrayed in the instruction as if they were troublesome. The ""important aspects of eroticism and desire"" must not be omitted. It is ""not advisable"" that parents can choose that their children be excused from sex education. They advise, in regards to the ""nationwide solid anchoring of school sexual education"" that the possibility of exemption from instruction should be disallowed. This requirement is seen by the critics of the white paper as being especially offensive.

2. Go through LiveMocha.com's German courses. They also have a paid section that is supposed to be pretty good.
3. Sign up for DuoLingo. It's still in beta testing, but I've tried it and it's pretty good. It's free and they offer German.
4. Go to Interpals.net and find a German penpal who is willing to mentor you. Even better, find one who wants to improve their English skills and is motivated to make a trade. You also might be able to find a penpal on Reddit.
5. Buy a German for dummies-type of workbook and go through one exercise every day. This will help your written German.
6. Download Pimsleur German and put it on your mp3 player. This is a completely audio-based German program and will help improve your speaking. 
7. Watch German movies/listen to German music constantly. Get the songs stuck in your head so that you remember the vocabulary words. 
8. Practice, practice, practice. Find someone else who is learning German and wants to practice with you. Finding a native speaker is great, but sometimes it's good to practice with a learner as well. Meetup.com or a local school can be a good source of local German clubs. Or practice online with people from /r/LANL_German or /r/GermanPractice.
9. Hire a cheap tutor. Frequently you can get cheap and decent tutoring in languages from local college students. I know this because I'm a German major and will work for peanuts, pretty much. No, I'm sure I'm not as good as a tutor with his/her PhD in German and whatnot, but I can definitely help out beginners. Find someone like this. Even better, you might find someone who wants to make a language trade with you, and you can get free tutoring in exchange for tutoring them.",0,1327783484,null,0,true,0,c3ll6p2,t3_p0laj,t1_c3ll6p2,t3_p0laj,null,1428256172,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"Italy is back. Germany’s Angela Merkel sits at the top of Europe’s power list. France’s Nicolas Sarkozy can lay claim to be the continent’s most energetic leader. Mario Monti is its most interesting. After an absence lasting a couple of decades Italy has returned to the stage. Mr Monti’s fate may turn out to be Europe’s.

There was a time when Italy had something to say in Europe. The Italians championed the great integrationist leap of the 1980s. The Milan summit in 1985 gave the push for the single market. Five years later a meeting in Rome set the timetable for the euro. This provided the occasion, incidentally, for the toppling of Margaret Thatcher: her “No, No, No” to the single currency stirred a Tory rebellion. Strange as it seems, British Conservatives were once mostly pro-Europeans.

The era of Silvio Berlusconi put an end to Italian influence. Though always assured of a warm welcome from Vladimir Putin, Mr Berlusconi was shunned by his European Union peers – seen by turns as a cause of irritation and embarrassment. Mr Monti, a serious-minded academic with a serious plan, is different in every dimension. Mr Berlusconi made crude jokes about Ms Merkel’s appearance. Mr Monti talks to her about economics.

 There is a second Italian at the top table. Mario Draghi – the other Mario – has made his own headlines during his short presidency of the European Central Bank. As far as economic orthodoxy goes, Mr Draghi styles himself an honorary German. Yet a big refinancing operation launched under his direction – quantitative easing by another name – has propped up the banking system and calmed financial markets.

The ECB scheme is not a permanent fix, but it has given the politicians space to negotiate Ms Merkel’s precious fiscal compact. For all the ever-present shadow of Greece, there are signs that the euro crisis is passing from an acute to a chronic phase. 

Mr Monti matters because it is in Italy that the euro’s long-term prospects will be decided. If Greece does fall by the wayside, Ireland, Portugal and Spain will be in the line of fire. Italy, though, is the pivotal player. If the eurozone’s third-largest economy cannot chart a credible economic course, the euro does not have a future as a pan-European project.

Mr Monti has a couple of cards to play. His austerity measures are already proving unpopular but Italy’s elected politicians are scarcely in good shape. Mr Berlusconi snipes from the sidelines but his centre-right coalition would be crushed in a snap election. So Mr Monti thinks he has another year – until scheduled elections in spring 2013 – to get his strategy up and running.

The second card is that he can speak truth to German power. His record as a liberal reformer in the EU Commission is indisputable. His demeanour defies every stereotype of the feckless southern European. Oh, and Mr Obama is right behind him when he tells Ms Merkel that indefinite austerity would turn a fiscal into a suicide pact. 

I suspect Mr Sarkozy rather resents Mr Monti’s intrusion. The French president is not one to share the limelight. Until now Paris has sustained the pretence that leadership belongs to the Franco-German partnership. In truth, the chemistry between the president and chancellor is anything but good. 

As it happens, Mr Sarkozy has more interest in Mr Monti’s success than most. Whenever I meet the French elites, as at the latest Franco-British Colloque, I am struck by their insistence that survival of the euro is existential. What they mean, I think, is that the break-up of the single currency would see France tipped into Europe’s second economic tier – and rob it of any remaining claim to global influence.

There is no guarantee that Mr Monti will succeed. Big spending cuts and tax increases are one thing. The real test will come in liberalising the economy. Here he confronts a honeycomb of closed shops, restrictive practices and rent-seeking cartels. This week Italian cities have been thrown into chaos by taxi drivers and truck operators. Lawyers, pharmacists and petrol-station operators are also up in arms at plans to strip away their privileges. This will not be easy. 

The choices are unavoidable. The debate about the future of the eurozone is hopelessly polarised. On one side stand those who say the enterprise can be saved only if Catholic southern Europe absorbs the Protestant north’s culture of thrift and hard work. On the other side are those who say that all would be well if only the Germans were ready to spend and borrow more and underwrite the debts of their southern neighbours. Both sets of arguments are hopelessly naive.

The challenge facing Europe – one crystallised by the euro crisis – is to adapt to a world in which it can no longer dictate the terms of exchange. Policymakers and economists can argue all they like about the merits and demerits of devaluation or fine-tuning the balance between fiscal rectitude and support for demand. The big question is whether Europe can compete in a world over which the west no longer holds sway. That’s why what Mr Monti is doing in Italy really does matter.",0,1327785207,null,0,false,0,c3llft1,t3_p0ayk,t1_c3llft1,t3_p0ayk,null,1428256291,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Ergo, saying that „Israelis the most anti-semitic people on the planet” is plain wrong, and is a cheap argument. The Israeli state might be treating Palestinians like shit, and it might be „xenofobic” or „anti-arab”, but calling this „antisemitism” is incorrect.

Presumably not only limited to a), but in general, but that'd be the focus due to context, here.

Also, you win two internets for that translation, feel free to submit a link to your translation here, you've earned the karma. And comparing my translation with yours made me realise just how mistaken I had been, believing my English skills didn't suck. 


[1] Konjunktiv, i.e. ""should must"". i.e. ""shall"". ""ought"", but definitive. Or rather demanding. ""is supposed to"", but without the accusative connotation.

[2] ""Heranwachsende"" just means ""those who grow up"" here, judging by context.

[3] This is just hard to grok because it's feared and loathed nominative-style German.

[4] ""Rechtsnorm"" sums up constitutional imperatives, laws, decrees, directives, etc. I guess ""law"" works perfectly fine. To get a feeling for the concept: ""Normenklarheit"", part of the concept of ""Rechtstaat"", means that all those must not conflict.

[5] ""beziehungsweise"" is *not* ""or""! It's ""respectively"". As in ""apply the other thing if applying the first thing doesn't make sense"". As in ""The eagles and dogs were looking at their claws, respectively paws"". You could use ""their claws or paws, as the case may be"", too, but that just doesn't befit that wonderful, succinct, precise, feared, and loathed, German legalese. Such fuzz is not to be applied ;)

[6] that's not actually ""gesellschaftlich"" but in this case perfectly fine. ""social"" is really a damn overloaded word in English, makes it practically impossible to use in any half-way precise sentence, so let's just imply it.

The background -  Long story short, the minister responsible for updating our legislation in relation to copyright infringement tried to pass an amendment to the relevant legislation that was already there to give copyright holders the right to get an injunction against infringers, amongst other vague and badly worded guff which could potentially impinge on citizen's civil rights and freedom of speech.

The kicker is that due to an archaic loophole, there was no need for debate in front of our house of parliament and it was due to just slip right in the other morning. The public and IT industry consultation seems to be non-existent.

So many people (60k +, that's massive for a small country like Ireland) petitioned the minister, our other parliamentarians and EU reps that their is now going to be a full debate in parliment since the rest of the reps seem uneasy that Anonymous are taking government websites down and the level of vitriol from people that understand the issue has spooked the politicians into finding out what all this is about. (Most have no idea whatsoever about anything to do with the internet) t

It's sort of like hitchhiking but more planned. I normally use that because it's way cheaper than taking a train although you need to plan your trip in advance. There are some bus services but I am not entirely sure about how they work. I have never resorted to taking a bus for intercity travelling.

Intracity travel. You can use bahn.de for planing your travels inside the city as well. Just look up the city map in google maps and use the tram/bus stops to plan your travels (input the destination and time in bahn.de and it'll give you the time and the respective tram/bus that you need to take to get there). Do not get stranded anywhere late at night. Taxis are expensive. Never get on one of them unless you are really screwed and you will feel like you have been anally raped after paying the taxi fare.

I would agree on the www.mitfahrzentrale.de It is the cheapest way to travel between two (big) cities, although it might be difficult to find someone going to small towns (then check if the small town is en route between two big cities and ask the driver if he can drop you of at the small town).  Also you sometimes get to know interesting people.

Big cities like hamburg have their own public transport system (Hamburg: http://www.hvv.de) and it is often faster and cheaper then  using a car.

Im here to help, we can work this out:)

This is actually a really smart question to ask and getting it answered will save you tons of stress. 

I've made mistakes with trains and had to spend the night on a freezing bus stop bench. You'll wanna try and avoid that.

But the good thing is that with longer distances, you can buy your ""Fahrkarte"" from an ticket agent and will be able to ask them anything as many times as you want in English. They are usually really helpful and its their job to help sort out lost travelers. Nobody expects a tourist to know how to get from one city to the next. So don't worry so much about that.

Taxis are for when you are drunk at 5am or late for a flight. Forget taxis.

Use this site http://www.bahn.de/p/view/index.shtml and the map I gave you to get from your apartment on the Reeperbahn in Hamburg to my apartment on Jonastrasse in Berlin. Can you do it?


Tell me what trams, buses, trains you are gonna take? Where can you get on this train?

If you can do that, you are in good shape.

To get on a train: There's a little circular button on the door that will light up green; push it. 
To get off a train: Same button on the inside. 
To get on an intercity bus: Go to the front door, since the driver will check your ticket. 
To get off: There are small buttons on the handrails that are usually blue or red with a little H (Haltestelle--Stop) on them. You push this button to signal you're getting off at the next stop; then by the door there will be the handrails on either side with buttons on them (some say STOP, some say H) that you push to open the door. (The first time I got off a bus, I tried to push the doors open like you do in Chicago and I got some strange looks... Also, stand back a bit from the doors as they are automatic and move pretty fast.)
For city trams and buses, no one checks your ticket (on buses, after 8p you have to go into front door, however) and you just get on (with a similar button system as trains). To get off the tram, it's similar as the train ([Here](http://www.brianwasson.com/trips/trains.htm) is a link to help with visuals; the site was updated in 2007 so the schedules won't be current but there are helpful tips anyhow). 

Also, when you buy a train ticket, someone comes and scans it or whatever. But when you're on a tram, first of all look into day tickets (Tageskarte; in Dresden it's valid from the time you punch it until 4a the next day, idk about other cities but probably similar) or week tickets (Wochenkarte) to save money depending on your situation; and secondly, if you buy a ticket from a machine at the stop, you have to punch it once you get on the tram (there are red or orange boxes on the tram or buses with a little slit that you stick your ticket into) and that makes your ticket valid. There are ticket checkers who get onto the tram or bus incognito and then check your ticket once the doors close (They carry IDs so only show your ticket to someone with an ID; however, no one is going to ask to see your ticket for shits and giggles). If you don't have a ticket or if your ticket isn't punched, boom, 40€ fee. Some people get on without tickets (they're called Schwarzfahrer) but I wouldn't risk it.

Yes, because there's only one country in such need of a bailout and risk of default as Greece. If Siemens goes bankrupt we don't force VW to obey the same rules as Siemens, either, even though they're in the same country. You don't hit companies with insolvency laws until they actually *do* hit insolvency. Greece, unlike German companies but like natural persons under German law, have a *choice* whether to swallow some terms or default the hard way.

You can use EuroRail, but that would be overkill if you're just travelling around Germany. All German cities are connected by railroad (called ""Eisenbahn"" or shorter ""Bahn"" in German). You can find out about the connections on their website [www.bahn.de](http://www.bahn.de) (switch the language to English and you're good to go).

Travelling within a city is similar: All cities offer some kind of public transportation: Trains, buses, trams, subways or a combination thereof. Every city has its own system, so which system you'll use will depend on where you're going. Most of the time these systems are interconnected (especially in bigger cities) within a public transportation system (""Verkehrsverbund""), and most of them offer a website ([MVV](http://www.mvv-muenchen.de) for Munich, [VVS](http://www.vvs.de) for Stuttgart and so on). There's usually a map of the transportation system available either online or at the stations. You probably won't find them in libraries (these are for books...).

Now, in smaller towns (like Lauter) there may not be a train system, but there may be a bus system (usually something like that has to exist to get the kids to school and back, and these buses are usually public). But the quality (i.e. number of lines and frequency) will vary greatly and highly depend on where you are. It would probably be best to contact someone in Lauter beforehand and find out about that. Unlike in the US, you usually don't or can't book a passage on a bus, you just find a timetable for your connection, go there and get on. Tickets can be bought at the stop or in the bus.

Otherwise, there's always taxis (usually at the closest train station), but they're more expensive than public transportation. And you can always get a bike (distances between towns are far smaller than in the US).

The HVV you found is *not* a taxi service, it's one of the city-wide transportation systems, in that case for Hamburg. As in other cities, it offers a combined system of buses, local trains and subways. In most cases, that means you can use on ticket on all those means of transportations, which makes things easier.

As for the language, I'd recommend getting a small dictionary (you'll be needing one anyway once you're there). Most people speak English, but sadly, they may be far from fluent.

All the public transportation tariffs I know (and that are a lot of them, I work in that field) have some form of day or 24 hour ticket. Some also have a 9-Uhr-Tageskarte/-ticket, which is only valid after 9 am but cheaper.

&gt; and secondly, if you buy a ticket from a machine at the stop, you have to punch it once you get on the tram (there are red or orange boxes on the tram or buses with a little slit that you stick your ticket into) and that makes your ticket valid

Thats really depends on where you are, but in my (very subjective) perception in most regions machines spit out tickets that are already valid. Good indicator is if there are fat arrows on the ticket or there are otherwise specially marked zones, chances are you have to punch it.

1) localise as much as possible . Local control and local responsibility . Be fully democratic and fully balanced - the small and medium sized businesses and the people having balance plus more against the monoliths - the corporations etc. .

The EU countries and people need to be self responsible and they need to be able to act responsibly . They also need to be able to deal with their respective situations and to evolve . 

Any problems need to be localised and minimised .

2) organise it as shells within a shell - a federation of states .

3) have local currencies for trade within each individual country and the Euro for international trade . Free float the currencies and exchange them by negatively QE'ing out of the source country and positively QE'ing into the destination country - no margin . Money is just hours worked so this would not be a problem - it's like using gold as an intermediate stage .

4) rule by common agreement between parliaments rather than by the vast Brussels bureaucracy .

5) the EU side should not effect within the countries but between the countries .

6) all people who work in other countries than their own - eg. on a short or medium basis - to have nominated home countries where they pay a large amount of their tax to and derive their health , social security , retirement etc. from . Likewise they should be able to purchase all goods and services that they want from their home countries - they should not be in a no person's land .

It is similar to the German *Bundesrat*, where the smallest states get 3 seats and the biggest states 6 seat, even though the biggest state has 27 as many people as the smallest state. In the EU, the biggest country has around 195 times as many people as the smalles country, and only 99/6=16.5 as many seats in the parliament.

I would be ok with giving the smaller countries even more seats than at the moment, but the same for every country would not be fair at all.

Esso prevede, fra le cose più criticabili, che le nazioni firmatarie:

* permettano alle autorità di agire contro i sospettati di violazione di copyright o di produzione di materiale contraffatto ""inaudita altera parte, specialmente se un qualunque ritardo può provocare un danno irreparabile al detentore dei diritti d'autore"" (§ 2, art. 12, comma 2);

* permettano alle autorità di ""confiscare o distruggere i materiali e gli implementi usati prevalentemente per la creazione di materiali contraffatti o in violazione di copyright"" (§ 5, art. 25, comma 4);

* permettano alle autorità di ""ordinare a un ISP di divulgare ai detentori del copyright informazioni sufficienti per identificare un cliente il cui account sia sospettato di aver violato il copyright"" (art. 27, comma 4);

* perseguiscano penalmente chiunque bypassi DRM e altri tipi di lucchetti digitali (comma 5) o crei prodotti e servizi che li bypassino (comma 6).

In verità il testo, mi dicono, era molto più draconiano ed è stato alleggerito. Ad essere sincero, alla fine mi è parso il solito linguaggio pieno di parole vaghe e di concessioni, e bisognerà badare più alle leggi dei singoli parlamenti che a questo trattato. Ma è meglio restare vigili e non fidarsi della bontà delle autorità.

Uno dei punti più criticati dell'ACTA è che le trattative sono state mantenute volutamente segrete dalle parti in discussione. (È per questo che il *rapporteur* che doveva monitorare la questione dell'ACTA per il Parlamento Europeo si è dimesso.) Solo negli ultimi anni sono stati pubblicati alcuni atti, e solo perché erano già stati resi noti da Wikileaks nel 2008; comunque sono stati rivisti più volte.

Ora che anche l'Unione Europea l'ha firmato, l'unico passo che resta è la ratifica da parte del Parlamento Europeo, e ciò dovrebbe accadere verso giugno. È uno dei pochi casi, o forse l'unico, in cui rappresentanti eletti dal popolo possono discutere dell'ACTA.

*(Già che ci siamo: SOPA e PIPA erano due disegni di legge statunitensi che prevedevano l'onere, da parte dei siti web, di eliminare ogni link a materiale che violasse il copyright, anche su semplice segnalazione, pena l'irraggiungibilità del sito tramite DNS. Dopo le proteste, SOPA è stato ritirato e PIPA è stato rinviato a data da destinarsi.

First of all, having everything spelled out increases the chance of mistakes being made. Politicians don't have competence on every area, and they shouldn't. They're there to make a framework. The courts, on the other hand, dig deeply into one case at a time, so boundaries can be drawn up where needed.

Second, it makes you miss out on societal development. If the US constitution was made to your wish, it would state that white men above a certain age, and those only, have the right to vote. Instead it said those who were *free* men. So society, including the courts (and over the course of several decades, of course), took a stand and expanded the definition of ""free"" to everyone. If you had to amend the constitution every time this happened, things would take a lot longer.

Constitutions are the ground rules. They're not meant to be changed very often. The closest thing we have to something like that, which also on many levels functions as one, is the European Convention on Human Rights. 

I'm not sure what you mean by that most rights in the constitution of the United States are negated. That's simply not true.

From watching news video and reading other articles it seems to me that the Swiss middle class mindset is ""Kids are getting their own improvised sex education anyway from the internet at a young age, so what's the problem with bringing the topic out into the open in schools?"" It's considered much more of a problem if children know the word ""gang bang"" but not the word ""ovulate.""

Once the results of the trial in Basel are available at the end of the school year, and people see that the world didn't fall apart, there will be far less opposition.

Looking at what it might do to trends in the West in general is even more interesting to me. 

* Switzerland is one the wealthiest countries in the world. It's a very desirable country to live in. It's admired all around the world.

* As you see from the article, the way that German-speakers think about these matters is so detailed and so thorough, that it would be difficult for other more prudish researchers in anglophone countries to refute their arguments and the results of what has happened in Basel's schools.

* Once the topic is breached between adults and children in a society like Switzerland... there is simply no going back. Those kids when they're grown up will never have any compunction about casually discussing how babies are made with their own children.

Well, to be honest that will get you nowhere. Parties in Germany don't work like that. You have to be in a party for a long time before you can do something. You need to have your group of people, above you and below you and you can't ""break out"". Sarrazin was a moron, but more importantly he was a moron that broke Parteilinie. Obviously this is more extreme in some parties (CSU) and less extreme in others (Gruene), but all in all being loud-mouthed and opinionated is only acceptable if you are in charge. You have to be a Parteisoldat for some time to earn those rights.
Now I am not saying that I agree with this, but the motion that ""loud-mouthed people"" will get what they want is simply incorrect.

--- 

As for your general problem: I wouldn't worry too much. While this can be a problem (I once heard an American girl saying that flirting in Germany is having a conversation on who you vote for), it's not required for everyday life. It took me a long time to understand the basics and there is still a metric shittone that I don't get. But you have all the time in the world, no? I honestly prefer this system. While rather slow-moving it has certain advantages, such as stability (it doesn't really matter which party is in charge, change comes slowly and is constantly re-evaluated). I live most of the year in a different country (VR/PR China), so my view is probably somewhat unique (I can experience the destruction and problems of a system that can move a lot very quickly and fuck things up faster than you can say ""Fubar"").

---

As for the law: Well, that is not because of your level of German - most people, at least those who don't study law, have this problem. I wouldn't worry too much about it, a lot of laws are not too unfavorable, just keep an open eye and an open ear. Watch ""die Oeffentlichen"" to get the basics for law-scams and problems (Telefonwerbung, Verbraucherschutz etc.) and if you encounter problems there is still time. Learning by doing is how we all role (my first landlord was a mess..).

true,SteveMcQwark,CANA,Canada,"&gt; An EU Constitution that defines the union not as a country but a Continent. Therefore the sovereignty of each country (not state) is infallible and equal to that of the Continent.

What you're describing is the definition of a federation. Canada, for example consists of 11 equal governments, being the 10 provinces and the federation. Each is fully sovereign over its jurisdiction as provided for in the constitution. You're just using slightly different terminology for it, which is fine, we use whatever language suits our purposes.

However, I should point out that, in the British Isles, the Continent means the mainland. Also, a fair portion of people would like to avoid the ""F"" word, even if that's what they're doing.

Edit: Just to add, your use of ""country"" is actually contrary to your intent. A country is a geographical area. Notice that Scotland is a country but doesn't have any sovereignty, being a constituent part of the United Kingdom which is a unitary state. A state, on the other hand, is usually seen as sovereign, even if – as is the case for most federated states – it isn't a sovereign state in international terms. The idea that a state in a federation is subordinate to the federation is a misconception often held by those who live in unitary states and only see federations from the outside.

As you can see from this list,

the number of vehicles per 1,000 people in the state of New York is 570, in the D. C. it's 350, way below the national average. This is obviously related to the availability of public transport in those states, which again is related to a high population density.

I don't remember exactly what the terminology means, but universities in Europe are going through a standardization process, and I *think* the 'ciclo' and 'curso' had something to do with that. I don't know what kind of resources your university has in terms of a study abroad office, but if there's a professor from Spain, they'd probably be willing to help you.

If you're not fluent in Spanish, though, remember that these courses are designed for native Spanish speakers. It's usually only a problem if the classes you want to take are super technical (think science or psychology classes), but if you're looking at filología classes you should be okay.

Also, I was in Vigo for a bit while visiting various places in Galicia and Portugal, and it was by far my least favorite city in Europe. It just wasn't very lively.

Yes, he has pretty much given up on trying to rush the referendum, given that it didn't go down too well. It was a classically ham-fisted, high-handed intervention that backfired - unless of course you believe that Cameron is a secret campaigner for independence. On balance I don't believe that.

As for this opinion poll - 180 Scottish respondents giving in theory a 7% margin of error. There does look to be an upward trend though, but it's early days, and there's plenty of time for the No Camp to develop the ability to distinguish their arses from their elbows. So far their antics have been lamentable.

So the referendum is set for late 2014, and personally I'm glad there'll be plenty of time to debate the issues.

true,yuhju,null,null,"In Spain, the regular 'Licenciatura' (or 'Grado', with the new system) consists of four years. The first two are called ""Primer ciclo"" and the second two ""Segundo ciclo"". Thus, you would be a third year student, which just happens to correspond to Segundo ciclo.

La distinción entre uno y otro se hace porque en España, al entrar a una Universidad, se entra específicamente a hacer una carrera determinada, cuyas plazas son limitadas. Esto es a diferencia de otros países donde se empieza en la Universidad y puedes ir consiguiendo créditos hasta tener suficientes para el Titulo que quieras, muchas veces hasta más de uno.

En España el primer ciclo sirve como ""base"" para tener más de una carrera. Por ejemplo, en estudios parecidos, como puede ser el caso de ADE y Economía, o Periodismo y Publicidad, el primer ciclo de esas carreras tiene un currículum muy parecido, de manera que un estudiante que ha completado los dos primeros años de ADE puede cambiar de carrera a Economía, hacer el segundo ciclo, y titularse en Economía. O bien, puede acabar los 4 años de ADE y después hacer sólo el segundo ciclo de Economía y tener las dos titulaciones.

So... yeah, that makes you a third year student, which makes you a Second cycle student. Hope that made sense.

That said, I'm looking at the link you provided, and it seems that the University of Santiago is quite atypical, since the ""Filologia"" studies have 5 years when in other places they usually only have 4 (maybe that is just for international students?). I guess that makes you a first cycle student there. Other than that, yes, you're looking in the right place.

I can't seem to find any course descriptions, though they should be there. As for credits, you have 4 kinds of courses: Troncales and Obligatorias (they are mandatory) and Optativas and Libre Elección, which you can choose from a pool of courses up until you have the necessary credits required (you can see how many on ""Terminación"").

I can't recommend a specific university since I don't have experience with any of those, but Santiago is quite notorious. Málaga is not as famous, but it does have nicer weather.

true,Mugros,,Niedersachsen,"That's not really new and also no specific to Germany. Politicians are a special social group. They don't represent the society. Mainly they represent themselves. To become a high-ranking politician you can't just do it from one day to another. You have to start in your youth, build lots of connections and work your way up. Also to become a successful politician you need or need to develop some personality traits that might be unacceptable elsewhere. You have to be able to lie and you have to believe your own lie without a doubt. It's of course, better not to lie, but if you have to.. make it believable. Politicians are mostly very egocentric and very disconnected from the ""normal"" society. Look at Gutenberg who copied and pasted most of his thesis without proper citation. He is completely ignorant of what he is accused of. He knows the truth somehow but would've never admitted to it, unless there is a huge amount of pressure. And still he thinks he is the victim. And he still wants to be a politician in Germany and is trying again and again though his reputation is abysmal. Power is like a drug and he wants it. These people need to be in the spotlight. 

They try to solve problems they have no clue of. E.g. the concept of the Internet simply can't be grasped esp. by older politicians.

If you follow politics in Germany it will look the same after a while anyway. There is always the party in charge and the opposition. The opposition is normally against everything the party in charge is proposing. It really doesn't matter much which one of the big parties, SPD or CDU, is in charge. Life doesn't change a lot for most citizens. CDU is pro-industry and pro-money, SPD is more worker-orientated and for social security. So, yes, there is a difference.

During elections he hear fantastic things but afterwards they are just words. The only interesting parties are the little ones. They are often more flexible and modern. But they can only do this because they are small. If they gain more influence they become more moderate. In the end you have to be popular with the majority of the population and that's why it all feels the same.",0,1327929026,null,0,true,0,c3m227o,t3_p1rdt,t1_c3m227o,t1_c3lvfkn,null,1428264282,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

Iron Sky und Inglourious Basterds kann man meiner Meinung nach überhaupt nicht zusammen bringen. Unterschiedliche Intention, komplett unterschiedliche Ausführung. Während bei Iron Sky offenbar ganz klar die Kultur und Ästhetik des 3ten Reiches so wie Nazi-Esoteriker satirisch zerlegt oder einfach nur simple veralbert werden, kann ich IB nichts weiter als eine brachiale Rachefantasie ausmachen. Ich meine, wirklich jetzt, ein sogenannter Bären-Jude der Wehrmachtssoldaten mit einem Baseballschläger den Schädel spaltet und Hitler den Kopf wortwörtlich zu Brei zerschießt? Das einzige was noch zum komplett Konzept fehlt, ist das Arsch abwischen an der Hakenkreuzflagge und vielleicht eine Vergewaltigung eines weiblichen SS Offiziers. Ästhetisch war der Film interessant, ansonsten langatmiges Gewaltspektakel - typisch Tarantino halt, nehme ich an. Ich persönlich fand im kompletten Film nur zwei Charaktere interessant und unterhaltsam: Hans Landers und den SS Offizier im Wirtshaus. Wenn ich also zu irgendeinem Zeitpunkt auf Seiten der amerikanischen/britischen Soldaten/Agenten und nicht auf Seiten von Nazi Offizieren habe sein sollen, hat der Film mal komplett versagt.

Unless you're very sure about what you're doing, _do_ _not_ take courses from a Licenciatura; the Licenciatura (5 year) system is being phased out and replaced by the Grado (4 year) system, and most Licenciatura courses are not taught anymore, even if they are still available as exams to students who must retake them.  For example, if you look at the page you linked, you will see this:
&gt;_2009/2010: 1º curso sin docencia, con derecho a examen. 2010/11: 1º curso sin docencia, último con derecho a examen. 2º curso sin docencia, con derecho a examen. 2011/12: 2º curso sin docencia, último con derecho a examen. 3º curso sin docencia, con derecho a examen. **2012/13: 3º curso sin docencia, último con derecho a examen. 4º curso sin docencia, con derecho a examen.** 2013/14: 4º curso sin docencia, último con derecho a examen. 5º curso sin docencia, con derecho a examen 2014/15: 5º curso sin docencia, último con derecho a examen._

The bit in bold means that next year only the 5th year of the Licenciatura will be taught, while the 3rd and 4th year will only have exams (it's also the last chance for 3rd year students).

As I said before, what you want to be looking at are the Grado courses. That means that at the Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, for example, you will have to choose from the [Grado en Filología Española](http://www.usc.es/es/centros/filoloxia/titulacions.html?plan=12802&amp;estudio=12803&amp;codEstudio=12425&amp;valor=9) and the [Grado en Lenguas y Literaturas Modernas](http://www.usc.es/es/centros/filoloxia/titulacions.html?plan=12953&amp;estudio=12954&amp;codEstudio=12609&amp;valor=9) where you can choose French subjects.

The _""Primer ciclo""_ and _""Segundo ciclo""_ terminology only applies to the Licenciatura system, so you can safely stop worrying about it. If you are a third year undergraduate in Canada, you are a third year (_""tercer curso""_) Grado student in Spain.

With regards to how many credits you should take, I think it's probably 60 (but don't take my word for it, as I did a _Licenciatura_ and all this newfangled Grado confuses me). I'm actually a bit busy right now, but if you have any specific questions please ask and I'll try to answer them tonight or tomorrow (GMT).",0,1327936134,null,0,true,0,c3m2t6p,t3_p2lou,t1_c3m2t6p,t3_p2lou,null,1435745093,5,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,5

Dear Derek Vaughan, Jill Evans, John Bufton and Kay Swinburne,

I write to you thanks to the grave dangers the European Parliament
currently poses to our civil liberties and privacy. You will no doubt
be familiar with ACTA, a 'wolf in sheepskin' bill that intends to
destroy the internet as it is under the guise of protection of
intellectual property. Of course, I have only heard one side of the
story through this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Xg_C2YmG0
and other similar sources.

If any of you support the bill, I would like to hear the other side. If
you're against it I would like to know what your plans are to defeat
it. I could even put you in touch with large communities that are
against the bill in an effort to sway your fellow parliamentarians.
Please take this matter seriously because this is the sort of thing
that my generation will go to the polls for and no one wants to see
UKIP take charge.

And while many did find work in other industries, there quite a number of people who became permanently drop-outs from the society.

However, what many forget when talking about a lost generation forget that this is more or less manufactured problem caused by frigid and inflexible job markets. In countries were the job market is free to act, people from all generations share the burden of unemployment, but in countries were jobs are heavily protected and laying of people is punished severely, earlier generations retain their employment, but younger generations won't even get their first chance.

In all of these countries, what the government should do is to the labour market, this would allow companies to fire their inefficient and unsuitable workers and either more competent or younger people to replace them. While the total unemployment wouldn't go down instantly because of it, it would allow sharing of burden cross all generations.
