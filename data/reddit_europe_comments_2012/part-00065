&gt; I wonder how much of that is due to him sending several hundred thousand Americans to Iraq and Afghanistan.

Very little. Many or most of those troops were full time to begin with, and total employment gain during the Bush II administration was 4.7 million jobs.

So there is science,  and then there is the usage of science, such as in public discussion. As an input. Like here. I find it fairly obvious we are talking about the use of science and not science itself for it is not an article in the Journal of Cultural Anthropology, right?

Your assertion, that science starts from a blank page, a neutral start, and not from established common-sense views... I could argue that it is not always the case, but OK let's accept it for now. This is one of the reasons that especially in the human field science is by no means complete. Psychology for example currently cannot neither deny nor affirm a whole lot of traditional views. 

However, we have a life to live, and science does not yet give us full recipes how to do everything, how to view everything, what to think about everything. We are very far from that. We cannot even make a list of all chemical reactions, that if done exactly by the book, as if by a programmed robot, results in a good stew. So what we do? 

We normally take the established traditional view as a starting point outside science, such as public discussion. Why? Because science is formal empiricism and logic. And what is tradition? Informal empiricism (life experience) and reasoning from that (logic). So whenever we have no formal evidence, we go for the informal, being better than nothing, and there is a felt urgency to decide things and not wait until research settles all. So we take tradition, and if and when it contradicts, demonstrably, provably with science, then we adopt that view. But not before. Why?

If you look at how much wealth transfer happens between states in USA, you will find it to be a minuscule amount. Most of economic transfers happen as emigrations instead, which is not easy in Europe due to language barrier. So earlier there was a huge immigration from Texas to California.

You're ridiculous to suggest that the average unemployment rate from 2001 - 2008 is something that I should be expected to have memorized.

I never said I was ""tired"" of Bush because of the average unemployment rate between 2001 and 2008.  I left my reasons unstated.  You introduced the unemployment statistics into the discussion.

Anyway, from your wikipedia link:

""The unemployment rate was 4.2% in January 2001, 4.6% in September 2006, and 7.2% in December 2008.""

So unemployment steadily rose under Bush.  I see now why you chose to present the average unemployment percentage.  That allowed you to water down the high unemployment when he left office by diluting it with the low unemployment he inherited from the Clinton years.

Now, one cannot infer causation from correlation, so the fact that Bush was president while unemployment rates rose does not prove that Bush caused them to change.  The president does not control the economy.

true,mouxlas21,GREE,Greece,"&gt; What stops the greeks from voting for candidates who want to do all this?

There is no candidate like that. As stated by [ouagadou](http://www.reddit.com/user/ouagadou) above:
&gt;So really, it's a chicken and egg problem, it won't be fixed because the more honest people don't want to get into rotten politics and the state machine anyway

There is truth in that(at least to those Greeks who do want things to change and do acknowledge our part in that mess). The media would chew him up. Corporations like Siemens would chew him up (bribing is always easier than negotiating). And keep in mind that Greece was a protectorate/client state of Britain and then the US. You can not really trust your democracy when you know that national policies are actually dictated from abroad (and are usually not in the nations interest). As for voting under these circumstances take a look at this: [Italian general election, 1948] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_general_election,_1948#Superpower_influence) ...and i quote:
&gt; The CIA's practice of influencing the political situation was repeated in every Italian election **for at least the next 24 years.**

Or this: [Greek military junta of 1967–1974](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_junta#A_.22Generals.27_Coup.22). There are many more examples of foreign powers intervening in Greece. There where dictatorships, monarchy was abolished and reinstated 3 times before it was officially abolished in 1974, rigged elections, scandals covered by the elite or the foreign powers etc etc ...with all that happening, how long do you think it takes the general public not to give a fuck and just look after it's own individual ass?

&gt; Instead you are voting for somebody who wants to perpetuate the inefficient public sector and thinks he can call EU's bluff by threatening to default on loans.

I guess you are referring to Tsipras and the party he leads SYRIZA. Well the other option is the 2 parties (NEA DIMOKRATIA(right-centrists) and PASOK(left-centrists)) that where in power since 1974. Those are the parties that brought us here and are more keen to keep the status quo. The leader of NEA DIMOKRATIA by the way is a paranoid asshole, who would do anything to get to the prime ministers seat. To understand his paranoia: He expelled Dora Bakoyianni from his party because she voted YES to the austerity measures when the party's position was NO. He then expelled 21 MP's of his party because they voted NO to the austerity measures because the party's posistion changed to YES. Dora Bakoyianni vent on to form her own party with people from NEA DIMOKRATIA who voted NO to the austerity measures while her party says YES. And now Dora Bakoyianni is back in the ranks of NEA DIMOKRATIA(!!!). Other options include the communist party (who think Stalin as a father figure and a cool guy) or GOLDEN DAWN who are Nazis (nothing to comment here) ...and both of those parties made it to the parliament so they can party like it's 1941. INDEPENDENT GREEKS are right-wingers who broke ranks from NEA DIMOKRATIA. The right in Greece was always very keen to suck on that british or american tit in exchange for power and loans. And then there is ZYRIZA who ...well i don't know ...i don't think they know themselves what they are about and what they want. They are a coalition of smaller parties that range from ecologist to hard core communists(!!!). I really don;t know how they keep it together. 2 libertarian parties DRASI (ACTION) and DIMIOURGIA KSANA (CREATION AGAIN) formed a coalition to boost their % and seem like a reasonable option ...but before they formed the coalition the second party demanded from the first that the coalition would start only after DRASI would drop it's coalition with another party named FILELEFTHERI SIMAHIA (LIBERAL ALLIANCE) because the leader of that party is openly gay(!!!).

Hmmm, define ""prohibited""? The ECB is using every trick in the book to ensure that banks have the liquidity they need. Are they technically running printing presses? No, probably not.

&gt; Maybe the problem is so chronic that any printing will lead to hyperinflation.

Ah ze German disease. No, this is a fear and in some respects a valid one, but inflation is in many ways a desirable thing and the consequences of not dealing with it can be painful (see Japan). Deflation would kill the EU economy quicker than anything. 

If the EU economy could ""inflate"" read devalue at about 5% pa for a few years then we'd probably be fine so long as the ECB steps in to raise rates later. BUT can you trust a political entity to do the right thing? No, probably not.

Hyperinflation would only take off if the expectations of the market (and by market I mean everyone in this case) were to be poorly managed.

true,Boxy310,null,null,"[Krugman](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/oy-canada/) has stated a number of times that it's quite possible for an economy to contract its public sector while exporting. His point is mostly about devaluation of its currency making exports more enticing to foreign markets, but the general strategy remains the same.

Let's take a look at Iceland. Again, from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Iceland) it has $5.3 billion in exports and $4.5 billion in imports, for a net of about $0.8 billion. Its GDP is listed as $14.1 billion, which would mean it's exporting on net 5.7% of its GDP's value.

You can see Iceland's currency devaluing significant vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar [here](http://www.exchange-rates.org/history/ISK/USD/G/180) over the years since 2007.

Now look at 2011 statistics for Ireland. From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland), it looks like $124.3 billion in exports and $71.35 billion in imports, for a net export of $52.95 billion. 2011 GDP is rated at €156.4 billion ($193.314 billion, according to [XE currency converter](http://www.xe.com/ucc/convert/?Amount=156.4&amp;From=EUR&amp;To=USD) , which would mean Ireland is exporting on net 27.4% of its GDP value.

However, it can't devalue its currency, so it can't drive exports up nearly as much as Iceland can with its own nationally-printed krona. In order to boost the attractiveness of exports, it would have to cut nominal wages for a given amount of workers, or else cut the number of employees (raising the marginal value of labor for the last unit hired). Since nominal wages are backwards-sticky - they won't tend to go down - we see unmployment go up dramatically in Ireland: [graph](http://www.irisheconomy.ie/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/unemployment.gif) [source](http://www.irisheconomy.ie/index.php/2009/05/08/rembrance-of-things-past/)

On net, however, it's not possible for the world economy as a whole to export, so this strategy of undercutting other exporting competitors won't work unless there's a market somewhere willing to buy your stuff. This worked out great for the U.S. during World War II, as British and Russian allies bought millions of tons worth of American industrial product. Without a buyer market, however, continuing to ""undercut"" each other by firing workers drags the market down, as workers are also the consumers of many of these products.

[Edit] tl;dr - It's not that it *can't* happen, it's that we can't all do what Ireland and Iceland are doing to boost the economy.

&gt; But the common theme with both Iceland and Ireland is that strong increase in government spending did not happen, yet they are both recovering, which **is what critics of ""austerity"" say can not happen**.

There is a far cry from ""This shouldn't be happening"" versus ""We predict something else should happen, but there are mitigating circumstances."" That's precisely what I was getting at: even Krugman, the posterchild for Keynesian economics right now, says that countries can grow by devaluing their currency to boost exports. This can't work for large countries because we can't all export at the same time. There has to be a market willing to import. Or, in other words, it's possible for austerity to work -- if you have a trading partner with a large demand.

I could also counter-argue your objections, due to Iceland [nationalizing Glitnir](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/sep/29/icelandiceconomy.banking) by buying 75% of its stock, [indicting bankers](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/2-former-executives-of-failed-icelandic-bank-charged-with-fraud/) accused of manipulating the market, and [rewriting their constitution](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/10/iceland-from-crisis-to-constitution.html) in part to increase transparency and trust in public institutions.

But this is not true and there are numerous historic examples that disprove it.

The problem of your whole reasoning is that you are focusing on demand as if it was singular and not diverse. People dont want to buy just anything, people want to buy specific goods and services they need, and when there is a mismatch between the type of supply and the type of demand is not a problem of confidence or expectations (although they always play a part) but of investors and entrepreneurs being able to switch production into what people demand.

The keynesian myth always portrays bussiness people as only reacting by producing more when there is more demand and producing less when there is less demand. This is not a realistic model. The entrepreneurial process is much more complex and nuanced.

For a nice dinner at a moderate price, I like the restaurant in the merkat de Santa Caterina  (google it for the address), expect to pay around 40-50euros per person but the food comes straight from the market and is very fresh. Try their solomillo and some of the sea food tapas. Doesn't take reservations so prefer to go on a weekday to avoid long lines for a table. 

In the Born area don't miss Xampanyet, a small tapas bar. It's well known for both tourists and locals, it's small and has a good atmosphere from the locals. In the same area (El Born) there are lots of pinchos places, Basque restaurants. Try them for a quick bite, I prefer Euskal Etxea, it's very close to Xampanyet and I usually go to both when I'm down there. Drink cava in Xampanyet and the Basque wine Txakoli in the pinchos place.

For a taste of the real patatas bravas and not the crap most tourist places have, head to Bar Tomas in Sarria , be careful of its opening hours and don't be offended by the apparent rude-ness of the waiters, it's just their thing and they can be quite funny at times.

The place which I think has the best local tapas in town is Vinitus, inside the L'Illa mall. The scenery is bad, being in a mall and all (I hate malls) BUT it does have the most fresh and well made tapas in town and that's coming from my survey of the locals I know.

4. Clothes and electronics are definitely cheaper in the US. 
5. You are going to need a bank over here- their equivalent to a debit card is an EC card and you can only get them in Germany.
6. Try to pick up a cheap bike here- look at a second hand.  Hannover has great number of bike trails.  They also have great public transport.

true,Phild3v1ll3,GERM,Germany,"&gt;The keynesian myth always portrays bussiness people as only reacting by producing more when there is more demand and producing less when there is less demand.

Because this holds true for the economy as a whole. If unemployment is rising and consumer confidence is low domestic demand will fall across the board (although there will always be exceptions for particular products), unless you can somehow make up that fall in demand with external or government spending, companies are going to be less inclined to invest. You can see this by looking at the cash reserves of large corporations, although they have been piling up cash since the 1980s, since the crash their reserves have shot through the roof.

&gt;To illustrate what Im saying let me point to the iPad as example.

Sure, demand for some items will rise and fall depending on a number of factors often independent of the overall economic situation, what we're talking about is aggregate demand not the demand for particular products.

Ho preso le 200 parole più utilizzate in un insieme di messaggi che avevo memorizzato. Ho eliminato le parole ""neutre"" e gli articoli, e ho cercato di dare dei valori da 0 a 100 ad ogni parola secondo 8 parametri. Non nego che, non essendo uno psicologo, mi sono inventato i valori. Però come ho detto, anche con questo ""lessico"" da me inventato, ho notato delle regolarità nell'umore dei tweet a seconda del giorno della settimana, e delle forti irregolarità in giorni come pasqua e il ritorno al lavoro.

Passo successivo è quello di prendere questo lessico e ""ampliarlo"". Ad esempio se nel lessico originale c'è la parola ""grazie"" con attributi felicità=20 e gratitudine=100, e vedo che la parola ""grazie"" viene spesso trovata insieme alla parola ""caro"", allora capisco che la parola caro avrà degli attributi simili. In realtà il tutto l'ho gia implementato, però sto aspettando di avere mooolti più messaggi di quelli che ho ora a disposizione. Infatti ho espanso il lessico ""di base"" con metà dei tweet che gia ho, e l'ho riespanso utilizzando l'altra metà, e i due lessici espansi risultanti sono si simili, ma non troppo. Questo probabilmente è dovuto a due fattori:

1. Statisticamente, ho ancora pochi dati per poter fare roba del genere

2. Potrei aver io dato dei valori sbagliati nel lessico originario

Aspetterò di avere qualche milione di messaggi prima ti trarre delle conclusioni adeguate riguardo l'espansione del lessico.

So much of our economy relies on large multinational companies viewing us as a safe, reliable, educated and open place to do business.

If you read press about the periphery, Ireland is just not mentioned alongside Spain, Portugal and Greece as often as it was 2 years ago.

The devaluation has happened from 2009-2012. There is good reason to expect that by 2013 we'll actually be at the bottom. People don't look at Spain and Greece with quite that same confidence.
