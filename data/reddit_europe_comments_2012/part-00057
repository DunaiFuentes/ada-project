Yeah upvotes for you, I enjoy this kind of debate too. 

Some Scots don't feel British, they want separation. The UK is a federal Union between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. If any of them want out then that is their want. 

I value our Scottish neighbours as part of the Union but I would never attempt to assign individuals identities that they don't feel comfortable with. Like the lable European some people in the UK use British as a geographical term, others use it as a label for pan-state unity. The difference is that I suspect you will find a much much higher proportion of the citizens of European nations will refer to their identiy in national terms rather than contiental ones. I for example would never presume an Irishman to be Irish or British, a Catalan might describe themselves as Spanish to a foreigner whilst at the same time harbouring a desire to leave the federation. Even staunch unionists in NI often tell people that they were Irish upon first meeting. Geographical labels such as that only mean something when there is a sense of identity behind them. 

There are problems of identity that threaten to undermine even a relatively congruous nation such as the United Kingdom or Spain. In order to govern effectively states need to self-identify in order to give law legitimacy. An elected Parliament still wouldn't give legitimacy to legislation if there wasn't enough common identity accross the people it is legislating for or the citizens don't accept it as soverign. You can't simply force different people's together which is why the former Soviet countries generally split their boarders down areas of national identity. Modern history has been littered by countries fragmenting along language or cultural boarders - some even (re)unifying for similar reasons. 

Nations are generally areas of soverign rule by a federal institution. The only real nation state in the world is probably Iceland - although some of the Scandinavian countries come close. Basques and Catalans all have their own sense of nationality and thus the Spanish government acts as a federation. The UK is a federation - the United Kingdom. Belgium is a federation to. If a parliament has the power to impose legislation then it is by definition a national parliament albeit not a soverign national parliament. Especially if that Parliament also monolpolises the use of force. 

Europe already has elected Parliaments and Commissions, however a nation such as the UK is outnumbered by delegates from other countries. As a result there is a feeling in the UK - a particularly Eurosceptic country - that the EP doesn't legislate with UK citizens in mind. One recent example would be the contraversial financial transaction tax that was vetoed by the UK, others include the CAP or the CFP. Those are accepted by the UK at the moment but the UK has opted out of other decisions that would have been detrimental to natioanal interest - for example the Schengen Area or the Eurocorp. A pointless fedaration would not give sovereign nations these opt outs. There would still be a percieved democratic deficit if indivdual countries were badly negatively effected by universal legislation because there is no solidarity between the nations. Say the UK suddenly invaded Iceland and as the result of a successful invasion gave the Icelandic people 4 seats in our parliament (seats are generally represent about 70,000 people). Those 4 seats would hardly be influential in a country of 62m and 650 seats. Those Icelandic people would be right to feel shortchanged by an electoral decision that didn't acknowledge their national identity. The UK parliament would have no democratic legitimacy over Iceland and Iceland would face a democratic deficit.

You didn't claim Europe was a superpower but I am just pointing out that it will never be one because of the divergent interests. Superpower by their nature have to be federal. I don't think that Europe will ever truely be federal, at least not in my life time.

I actually like your metaphor of the truck driver turned poet hype. Two thirds of Pirate voters said they voted for them because of dissatisfaction with other parties, and only one third said they did so for their policy positions. So, right now, they're a ""protest party"" for people who don't want to vote for the extreme left or right. It's probably not surprising that they got 16% in the under-30 demographic, what may surprise you is that they still got 8% of the 45-59 year olds' votes. They've seen them in interviews and they've read articles about them, and they believe the Pirates are something they want to vote for.

true,MeteorPhoenix,PUER,Puerto Rico,"&gt; Some Scots don't feel British, they want separation. The UK is a federal Union between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. If any of them want out then that is their want.

You can see a middle ground, can't you? Surely you feel proud of being English and proud of being British at the same time. Is it that unreasonable that someone might be proud of being German *and* European at the same time?

&gt; I value our Scottish neighbours as part of the Union but I would never attempt to assign individuals identities that they don't feel comfortable with. Like the lable European some people in the UK use British as a geographical term, others use it as a label for pan-state unity. The difference is that I suspect you will find a much much higher proportion of the citizens of European nations will refer to their identiy in national terms rather than contiental ones. I for example would never presume an Irishman to be Irish or British, a Catalan might describe themselves as Spanish to a foreigner whilst at the same time harbouring a desire to leave the federation. Even staunch unionists in NI often tell people that they were Irish upon first meeting. Geographical labels such as that only mean something when there is a sense of identity behind them.

That's true, and that'd be up to the individual person. There is such thing as an European identity, though, beyond just the geographical terms.

&gt; There are problems of identity that threaten to undermine even a relatively congruous nation such as the United Kingdom or Spain. In order to govern effectively states need to self-identify in order to give law legitimacy. An elected Parliament still wouldn't give legitimacy to legislation if there wasn't enough common identity accross the people it is legislating for or the citizens don't accept it as soverign. You can't simply force different people's together which is why the former Soviet countries generally split their boarders down areas of national identity. Modern history has been littered by countries fragmenting along language or cultural boarders - some even (re)unifying for similar reasons.

Well, let me use an example that hits close to home: the Scottish voting to increase English student tuitions, since England doesn't have its own Parliament (I might be over-simplifying the controversy). Is this event proof that the UK is undemocratic, or merely proof that changes must be made to the system?

&gt; Nations are generally areas of soverign rule by a federal institution. The only real nation state in the world is probably Iceland - although some of the Scandinavian countries come close. Basques and Catalans all have their own sense of nationality and thus the Spanish government acts as a federation. The UK is a federation - the United Kingdom. Belgium is a federation to. If a parliament has the power to impose legislation then it is by definition a national parliament albeit not a soverign national parliament. Especially if that Parliament also monolpolises the use of force.

Well, doesn't that feed my point? Spain is a county with different ""countries"" in it; the UK and the 4 home nations; Belgium with Flanders and Walloons; etc. You consider these legitimate parliaments, but don't think the same of the European one. What is the crucial difference? How is the European identity any more artificial than the Spanish one?

&gt; Europe already has elected Parliaments and Commissions, however a nation such as the UK is outnumbered by delegates from other countries. As a result there is a feeling in the UK - a particularly Eurosceptic country - that the EP doesn't legislate with UK citizens in mind. One recent example would be the contraversial financial transaction tax that was vetoed by the UK, others include the CAP or the CFP. Those are accepted by the UK at the moment but the UK has opted out of other decisions that would have been detrimental to natioanal interest - for example the Schengen Area or the Eurocorp. A pointless fedaration would not give sovereign nations these opt outs. There would still be a percieved democratic deficit if indivdual countries were badly negatively effected by universal legislation because there is no solidarity between the nations. Say the UK suddenly invaded Iceland and as the result of a successful invasion gave the Icelandic people 4 seats in our parliament (seats are generally represent about 70,000 people). Those 4 seats would hardly be influential in a country of 62m and 650 seats. Those Icelandic people would be right to feel shortchanged by an electoral decision that didn't acknowledge their national identity. The UK parliament would have no democratic legitimacy over Iceland and Iceland would face a democratic deficit.

You're taking it to the extreme, I think. The UK chose to join the then-European Community, fully aware of the idea of the ever closer union. The 3 main parties in Parliament have, in their platform, the policy of staying in the EU, so from the standpoint of representative democracy, the British people have chosen to stay in the EU and continue to do so by voting for pro-EU parties.

The UK has a very, very large influence within the EU. It only hobbles itself because it can't decide whether it wants to be in or out, and that subtracts from its power. I do agree that the British have to make their choice; are they European or not (or rather, do they want to be European or not)? Trying to have it both ways just makes everybody (especially the British) resentful. If a Parliament you consider foreign is making laws for you, that's going to piss you off... but you're still there.

Moreover, iirc, the UK limited itself even more by leaving the conservative coalition in the EP and instead joining the far-right eurosceptic coalition.

&gt; You didn't claim Europe was a superpower but I am just pointing out that it will never be one because of the divergent interests. Superpower by their nature have to be federal. I don't think that Europe will ever truely be federal, at least not in my life time.

Well, there is a difference between ""never"" and ""not in my lifetime"", you know. I don't think it'll happen in the near future, but I do think it'll happen one day.

true,twocats,ROMA,Romania,"&gt; ""Kurac"" means cock in Croatian and Serbian, but it is used in coloquial conversation as a comma, punctuation mark, universal pronoun, much like ""fuck"" is in English, yet you can't hear it on television. That makes all talk on television seem incredibly uptight, official, insincere and unauthentic.

Huh. In Romania, many people tend to use ""ce pula mea"" or ""baga-mi-as pula"" like a comma (sort of *what the cock* and *stick my cock*), yet here it is still considered an annoyance. 

&gt; ""Pizda"", however, is a sinonym for ""pička"" that is considerd slimy and disgusting, and refering to any woman as ""pizda"" in any situation whatsoever is simply unthinkable. Women can refer to their own sex organs as ""pizda"" but it is ment to show disdain and provoke unease. Guys however get called a ""pizda"" often, and it means they are gullible, naive or bitchy.

true,keypuncher,null,null,"&gt; I have never understood why that clause exists. Even without this clause, the rest of the clauses would still have worked.

The reason that clause exists is because a lot of young people who don't get insurance through their employer choose to not purchase insurance on their own (both because it is a good bet they won't need it, and because insurance premiums are very high if the employer isn't paying the lion's share of them).

One of the better provisions of the law is that it prevents insurers from denying coverage (previously it was common for insurers to do so on any pretext, if someone was going to be a net cost).

Because the law will force insurers to cover people that are going to cost them money, an additional source of revenue was required to offset those costs.  Forcing all the people who would otherwise not pay premiums to do so, offsets that cost.

Where things get interesting is in the gray area between the poor and middle class.  There are a lot of people there who make too much money to qualify for government benefits, yet cannot afford to pay the premiums for insurance (I was one of them).

true,[deleted],null,null,"Right, the temporary efsf has a different capital key (still somehow based on ECBs), but the point still stands - nowhere close to a majority, and comparable to other large economies (27% vs 20%).

The efsf also operates under unanimity, so regardless, each country can veto the use of that money - again I don't see how anyone can spends another's cash at will.

Re exposure to Greece in particular, that's a dated graph, and doesn't take into account the greater, sovereign exposure - the bilateral grant exposure (at 80b http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government_debt_crisis#First_austerity_package_.E2.80.93_February_2010 - again following ECB's key somehow - w Germany at 28% and France at 21% ), the exposure throught efsf (~ 103.7b currently: http://www.efsf.europa.eu/about/operations/index.htm ) or the european central bank exposure (estimated at 177b few months ago: http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0306/breaking13.html) - and these should dwarf the remaining private exposure esp after the recent haircut of ~ 53.5%. I hope ECB number isn't double counting of some part of the bailout cash, but in any case...

Honestly, I don't see much of a difference in status, but risks roughly proportional to economic size, and hence of pretty comparable magnitude.

If you actually look at the ""share"" column, Germany's percentage is shown as the largest. But this is expected, because Germany is the largest country. However, this is not a true measure. 3 out of 4 euros are given by other EU states. Germany's share is more or less in line with its population. The only real measure is the burden per person, in euros. That's the bill. About €7 per month for 3 years, per person.

true,kyr004,CYPR,Cyprus,"well this article [appeared a few days ago on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/tixjc/more_than_half_of_police_officers_voted_for/) and another poster ""krattr"" said it far better than I can, so I will copy-paste what he said, which is in corroboration with my view:

Absolutely not.
From the original article (Google Translate):
&gt; In most of the polling stations where police officers vote, along with other citizens, the percentage of Golden Dawn ranges from 19-24%, and is the largest observed across the capital.

He writes about some of Police's polling stations in the City of Athens (not the metropolitan area), where citizens also vote (including those temporarily held), and still 76-81% did not vote for Golden Dawn.

How he ends up with ""more than half"", is beyond my understanding. ""More that half"" in mathematics would be ""more than 50%"" everywhere. Besides Hellenic Police's forces have more than 50,000 members. Golden Dawn did not receive more than 25,000 votes from them. Anyone can check ekloges.ypes.gr and do the math.

I've seen Facebook posts a few days ago about it. Some blogs picked it and it ended on a mainstream publication. Good to see journalism standards in action.

Edit: trying to figure out his rationale.
He says:
&gt; ...a few hundred meters nearby, in Tsoha St.'s polling stations, where police officers don't vote (note: he means exclusively, blame his syntax), Golden Dawn's percentage drops to 12-14%. Bearing in mind that on overage, in each on of these polling stations, as shown in the electoral roll, approximately 550-700 people voted, and the number of police officers voting there ranges from 20%-30% of the total votes cast, then with the relative reduction the percentage of police officers voting for Golden Dawn ranges between 45%-59%.

So, by now we've established that he talks about ""half of the police officers"", in some polling stations, near the Police Headquarters, in a neighbourhood of the 7th district of the City of Athens! Nice case, huh? ""1 in 2 Greek cops votes Nazis"". Pulitzer prize, here he comes.
But let's examine the case.
He says that up to 30% of the voters there, are police officers. There is no way of obtaining such data, profession is not recorded in the electoral roll and I'm guessing he didn't stand outside of each polling station from 07:00-19:00, asking everyone if he/she was a cop. 

Nevertheless, Golden Dawn's largest percentage in these polling stations was 14%. The largest possible percentage of police officers in them, according to his ""data"" (I'm guessing: ""Police HQ nearby, let's give it 20-30%""), is 30%. Do you see where he's going? If up to 30% of the hypothetical cops voted there, and Golden Dawn took 14%, then divide 14 by 30 and half of the hypothetical cops voted for Golden Dawn! Because, you know, it's impossible for citizens to vote for Golden Dawn, or for cops to vote for other parties (as the vast majority of them did, in polling stations where they vote in large numbers, as the same journalist wrote above)!

In reality, as shown in the results, more police officers (hypothetical or not) voted for the parties of the Left, than those who voted for Golden Dawn.

(By the way, Golden Dawn's voters were 440,000. In the previous election, they were 20,000. If ""half of the police officers"" vote for them, then we're missing 5,000 votes from 2009.)

So, the Dem.Left will either have to join them or fade into obscurity. 

3. The predictions of Syriza getting about 25% in the next elections are probably exaggerated. There is currently a systematic PR attack targeting Syriza from older parties and established media. This will probably curtail Syriza's growth although that also means that the next election results are also going to be an impasse.

**FAQ**

-----------------

**1) [What is your point?](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/tlt5f/dear_germans_its_time_for_a_reality_check/c4ntrmn)**

I've used the example of the loan agreement between Greece and other Eurozone members (Estonia was out at the time), in order to educate our fellow Germans (which I love, that's why I tease them). Unfortunately, given their populist media's rhetoric, the average German thinks that he/she pays the most, in relation to other EU citizens. This is not true. He/She pays accordingly to Germany's population and his/her means. 3 out of 4 euros are paid by other EU states.

Putting it differently, Fritz from Frankfurt is in for €273,05, and Fiona from poorer Dublin, from heavily indebted Ireland, is in for €293,22. Think about it.

**2) [Why don't you calculate the loan contribution per person in relation to the GDP per capita?](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/tlt5f/dear_germans_its_time_for_a_reality_check/c4ntml5)**

The first thing people ask is: ""how many Euros did I give away?""

There's your answer (commitment per person).

The nominal figure is used because EU is about convergence. While that loans are being repaid (with interest), the relative value will change. Nevertheless, the point still remains: a German does not foot the bill for the rest. He/She pays his/her share. Also note that only Germany did not sign directly, but via a development bank (KfW).

If you take a look at GDP per capita, German GDP per capita is 5th, German loan contribution per person is 6th. Ireland, Finland, Italy, and Portugal pay more given their relative GDP per capita position (combined they have the same population as Germany).

**3) [But don't you see that Germany pays the most?](http://i.imgur.com/CFwTa.jpg)**

Other EU states paid 72,08% of the total amount in this loan agreement (note that other agreements are similar). Germany paid its share. Its population is 26,02% of the lenders' total, and its share in the loan is 27,92%.

**4) [Why don't you calculate the money Germany gives to the IMF?](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/tl4b9/french_socialists_we_didnt_vote_for_an_eu/c4ntp6q)**

The title of the spreadsheet is ""Greece - EU loan (2010)"". Germany's IMF share is 6%. The money Germany gives to the IMF are used around the world. The IMF is funded by EU and non EU states.

**5) [Why don't you calculate Germany's EU contributions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/tl4b9/french_socialists_we_didnt_vote_for_an_eu/c4ntp6q)**

Because every EU state, according to its means, pays into a common EU pool. This is nothing extraordinary, they are regular EU contributions, not special loan agreements.

**6) [Will Greece have money for salaries and pensions if Germany didn't pay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/tlt5f/dear_germans_its_time_for_a_reality_check/c4nto1n)**

Yes.

In an extreme scenario, Greece could postpone the payment of instalments. Greece runs a primary surplus for months now. Wall Street Journal reported a primary surplus of €2,3 billion in the first three months of the 2012. Greece also had a small primary surplus last year, as reported by the BBC. The country could function and the Sun would still shine. The government could pay for the state to run normally.

The ""bailout"" tranches are used to repay the loan(s). Actually, they are used to fund insolvent European banks.

**7) I've read that Greece ""defaulted"", where did my money go?**

Greece has restructured most of the private debt (investors agreed on a change of the original terms; some may call it a restricted technical default), where many people made a decent profit. Old bonds were trading at 30% of their value. These people bought them, accepted a 53,5% reduction, and took back 15% in cash. Now, THAT's a great deal!

However, this transaction (again imposed my Merkel's cabinet, which has since changed its opinion and wouldn't allow other EU states to do it) made little difference. Writing off €100b, borrowing €130b and keep pumping money to insolvent European banks? Now THAT'S another great deal!

Aren't you furious yet? Yes, you are. About time to expose an ill-designed plan.

**8) Will Greece leave the Eurozone?**

No.

There is no mechanism for that. If other EU states stop paying (reminder: in reality they pay banks via Greece), then Greece could stop paying back. This would hit the banks, and the markets would seize the opportunity to attack other vulnerable EU states. The EU would negotiate with Greece about the conditions of paying back what it received so far. Internally, nothing would change in Greece. The extreme austerity program already ruined most of the country. The only way is up.

**9) Will Greece leave the EU?**

Only if Greece wants to, and Germany wants to destroy itsef and the EU. If Germany would try and force Greece out (again: there's no mechanism for expelling a state), the markets would smell blood. Germany needs exports and the flow of capital would kill the German economy. But in any case, this is not going to happen. Even measures against Greece would be decided by qualified majority voting. Germany doesn't have that many votes.

**10) Don't you appreciate others helping Greece?**

Of course I do, that's why I should tell it like it is.

Greece is responsible for not putting its house in order earlier. The previous Greek government (PM Papandreou, sworn in 2009) is responsible for a) not acting decisively during the first six months in office, and b) putting incompetent people in ministerial positions. The crisis could be avoided.

But what happened after that, was not good for the German and other EU taxpayers. They funded an ill-designed plan that a) destroyed Greece's faltering economy, b) increased Greece's debt, c) sent healthy banks to the red zone, and d) endangered the global economy. EU governments took EU citizens' money and didn't tell them the truth. This plan was a great deal for many people, and made many of them richer. Merkel is personally responsible for bowing to [FDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Democratic_Party_(Germany)'s demands. Then the rest of EU followed through (albeit many leaders had reservations), because Germany is EU's largest economy. There is a saying in Greek: ""Q: How do the blind people go to Hades ([mythical Greek underworld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_underworld))? A: By following each other.""

In reality, it would be cheaper to pay back most or all of Greece's debt from the beginning ([graph 1](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/HellenicOeconomy%28inCurrentEuros%29.png), [graph 2](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Greece_public_debt_1999-2010.svg/500px-Greece_public_debt_1999-2010.svg.png)), while Greece put its house in order. Even just the amount of the first loan agreement between Greece and other Eurozone partners at the time (the one that started this discussion), would help lowering Greece's debt to GDP ratio  below 100%. Then the EU would save the world from two years of misery, Greece would not be cut off from the markets, Portugal and Ireland would not follow through, bond rates would not go through the roof, and recession would not reach levels that  are observed only after a war.


**tl;dr: So, what is this whole saga about?**

Germans (and other EU citizens) are not obligated to do anything, and they're not hypocrites. They are just ignorant or misinformed, and Merkel's cabinet is largely the one to blame. Not the German nation.

The issue at stake is to tackle the problems of many EU states, and find a systemic solution to the inherent systemic deficiencies of the Eurozone. The extreme austerity programs do not work, they make the situation worse. Greece's recession is more than twice of the projected.

Putting it differently: dear German, do you want to give money to something that doesn't work? No. Do you want your money back? Yes. Then make it work. Relax the conditions, they were relaxed for you when you were in trouble, [US wrote off two-thirds of your Marshall Plan debt, you paid back your WW1 debt in 2010](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/thkyp/francois_hollande_has_threatened_to_block_the/c4mv7oh). Forcing EU states out will open Pandora's box for the rest. It will also make things worse for Germany's exports.

Focus on growth in other EU states, demand it from your politicians.

1. A comment about how banks need to use their power to support the economy more was turned to mean that Syriza wants to steal people's savings from the banks. **HOWEVER:** Any parties' comments can be taken out of context to mean something terrifying. 

2. Syriza's letter to the Commission was criticised as being too soft and as an indication that they are not going to negotiate as hard as they say. **HOWEVER:** PASOK and ND's stance so far can be criticised because they both promised more ""negotiation"" and failed to deliver. No one brings that up these days.

3. The same letter was also criticised as being too harsh and a potential reason for Greece to be kicked out of the euro/EU. **HOWEVER:**  Venizelos' stance at his maiden eurogroup meeting can be criticised as too dangerous and risking the bailout money. No one ever criticised him for it even though a tranche of the money was delayed for months because of him.

4. All major newspapers and news outlets portray Syriza as irresponsible and irreconcilable because they don't want to play along with the coalition government. **HOWEVER:** Samaras said he'd call elections again if he didn't get an outright majority in the first elections. But no one considers him as irreconcilable as Tsipras. I wonder why.  

5. At the same time, they are criticised that they do not intend to keep their election promises. **HOWEVER:** This is contradictory with the above criticism. You can't expect them to both keep their promises but also severely compromise them so that there are no repeat elections.

So, while I agree that Syriza is probably withholding information from its voters and is being generally dishonest, I don't see how they deserve to be targeted more than any other for it.

This is exactly true. Syriza is counting to increase their power with repeat elections. However it is unclear what they intend to do with that power. A optimist interpretation could be that they need more seats in the parliament because otherwise they won't be effective in government. The cynical interpretation is, of course, that they only see this as a numbers game.

&gt; “Sparen oder raus"" – diese Botschaft von Finanzminister Schäuble trifft auch die Mehrheits-Meinung der Bundesbürger. Zum Schutz des Euro wünschen sich 73 Prozent der Deutschen, dass die Hellenen die Gemeinschaftswährung verlassen und in eine geordnete Insolvenz gehen. Das ergab eine repräsentative Online-Umfrage vom Marktforschungs-Dienstleister Toluna und Thöring Heer &amp; Partner. Rund 60 Prozent werten das Signal gegen die strikte Sparpolitik nach den Wahlen in Griechenland und auch Frankreich als ernsthafte Bedrohung für den Euro.

According to the poll (and the opinion of the German Finance Minister), it's the German way or no way. While the German way failed spectacularly (not blaming individuals, but the cabinet), because recession was much higher than projected and the effects could not be contained, the German views increasingly lean on the ""we pay, you follow"" mentality. You might disagree, but the view on the street is that the Germans pay too much and the results are not good, that's why they should withdraw. They never realised that a) they pay their share, nothing more, nothing less, and b) the program has failed because it was the wrong prescription.

On the other hand, Germans were happy to accept a reduction of their Marshall Plan debt. US [wrote off 2/3 of it](http://web.archive.org/web/20060709055340/http://www.germany.info/relaunch/culture/history/marshall.html).

&gt; In 1953, it was finally established in an agreement signed in London that Germany would have to repay only a third ($1.1 billion) of its debts to the U.S.

The debt that was forgiven, in [current prices](http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/):

&gt; In 2011, the relative value of $2,200,000,000.00 from 1953 ranges from $15,400,000,000.00 to $87,500,000,000.00. 

That makes it up to €68b.

Conditions matter. It's impossible to force Greece/Ireland/Portugal to pay back the loan in a few years, when Germany's WW1 debt was [paid off in 2010](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8029948/First-World-War-officially-ends.html).

Everyone gave Germany some room to breathe, while Germany insists on enforcing [impossible conditions](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304203604577393964198652568.html) upon others.

&gt; Mr. Papandreou says that when he asked German Chancellor Angela Merkel for gentler conditions in 2010, she replied that the aid program had to hurt. ""We want to make sure nobody else will want this,"" Ms. Merkel told him.

Which still does not tell us anything about the multitude of opinions possible that are not what you claim them to be.

&gt; According to the poll (and the opinion of the German Finance Minister), it's the German way or no way.

According to the poll, 73% are in favour of an ordered insolvency of Greece. 60% interpret the votes against austerity as a severe danger to the Euro.

That does not mean ""German way or no way"", it means what it says.

&gt; because recession was much higher than projected and the effects could not be contained

And that in a time where salaries are increasing, again. Germany ain't in no recession. It may still be on the way out of one, but surely not on the way into one.


&gt; You might disagree, but the view on the street is that the Germans pay too much and the results are not good, that's why they should withdraw.


Do you happen to have a poll at hand that asks about the *banks* share, whether the aids help those banks or Greece? Because those 73% say ""let the banks bleed"".

Letting the banks bleed, however, is not a thing the Government is trying to do. 

&gt; Welcome to Opus Dei.

Ah what splendid rhetoric. Do you really think Greece would've started to get its shit together without some pressure?

&gt; On the other hand, Germans were happy to accept a reduction of their Marshall Plan debt. 

Yes! And so would Greeks be happy to accept an insolvency, I reckon?

However, your doc would be free to bill an insurance agency if you fail to pay him/her (which means you would be insured again).     
      
But I still automatically collect debt, because once you get insured again, you still have to pay (to your new insurance agency) all contributions you missed during your time being uninsured, plus the fines for being uninsured, for up to 5 years.    
So for example, if I get insured again after 2 years, I have around 4000€ dept.

There are just about enough people who feel Spanish in Catalan and Basque country to make it work, refurendums to leave a union would be denied. Belgium doesn't work as a country, its parliament has barely any legitimacy and they can't pass laws. 


Labour and the Conservatives both offered refurendums on UK membership of the EU, none of them have gone actually gone through with their manifesto promises. The idea was scrapped in the coalition agreement but will probably reemerge if the Conservative gain an absolute majority next election.

Your culture is *very* closely related to everything around it, whether or not you decide that your ""identity"" expresses that.

&gt; Not really because political identity does not equal a geographical identiy.

Well, identity is a social construct in the first place. You seem to be arguing against a claim that ""cultural identity"" is a unified European thing, which nobody is or has been making.

More generally, you seem very entrenched in ideas of *national* identity (just like the Northern Irish and Scots for that matter), which I will remind you is a very recent concept, arising around the time of the French Revolution and the concept of ""patriotism"". Realize that the nation as an instance of representation of a culture has only existed for about 200 years, while most European cultures can be traced back at least a millennium to the pre-historic tribes and clans.

I realize that most British people have very little knowledge of continental cultures, due to their general laziness in learning foreign languages, but really, the similarities are quite striking. There are *extremely* few concepts in British culture that Scandinavians, Germans, Dutch and even French people aren't *immediately* familiar with, all the way down to the tiniest details like idiomatic expressions. Language and culture, like goods, are traded between cultures that are geographically adjacent, and we have each formed each other's cultures throughout the last few millennia. The English have been no less impacted by this — in fact I'd say they have been *more* impacted than most, by nature of being 1) a strong sea-faring nation with many trade routes, and 2) an extremely aggressive nation.

Trying to isolate an ""English"" culture as separate from all other European cultures is madness.",0,1337008036,null,0,false,0,c4nvldo,t3_tjd3j,t1_c4nvldo,t1_c4nv42y,null,1428922142,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"The problem I usually refer to is that by contributing more, the core countries would risk the emergence of populist anti-bailout parties, which are already making it difficult to find majorities in Finland and the Netherlands. Apart from that, I have criticized Merkel for not ponying up more money early on in the crisis when state election were about to be held. She was consistent about dragging her feet afterwards, though, I have to give her that.

German parties are actually able to make unpopular decisions if they absolutely have to. Ten years ago it was Germany who held the ""sick man of Europe"" title, and the Social Democrat and Green government coalition (yes, the left), cut spending, slashed welfare and unemployment benefits, reformed labor markets, and increased the retirement age. That's how Merkel became chancellor in elections that were surprisingly close, considering the circumstances, but it's also one of the main reasons why Germany went from having one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe to one of the lowest. You could also argue that Germany going into hyper-productivity mode contributed to the relative loss of competitiveness in Southern Europe, especially since they also got the unions (!) to accept stagnant real wages in return for the employer associations' promise to create more jobs and apprenticeships.

What we're seeing here, though, is on an entirely different level. What is now the second largest party of Greece is playing for new elections even though this means that the country they hope to be able to govern will be without leadership during a time that could decide over whether or not Greece can remain in the Eurozone, or indeed the EU. This isn't something reasonable people could have different opinions about where a party picks one side out of political convenience, but they actually risk their country turing into a failed state for the off-chance that they might be able to form a majority coalition for them to lead if there were new elections.

Basically, it's titled ""Incidents"" and from what I gather, involves German U-boats patrolling off the British coast, to intercept convoys of steam ships (Dampfer) and their escorts (Bewacher). The first section seems to describe one successful sinking and the second (""Barrister"") an aborted attempt due to the target veering at the last moment, preventing a shot based on calculations involving angles.

&gt; -- Germany's Schaeuble says the price of a Greek euro exit would be very high

&gt; -- Minister warns the euro zone is in a highly nervous situation

&gt; -- Says France's Hollande should know the fiscal pact is a done deal and can't be changed

&gt; By Andreas Kissler and Andrea Thomas

&gt; Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

&gt; (Recasts, adds comments, background)

&gt; BERLIN (Dow Jones)--German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble Monday sent a strong warning toward Athens, saying the price of a Greek euro exit would be very high for the country and the euro zone itself.

&gt; The comments come as Greek politicians struggle to form a new government, fueling speculation on whether the country will remain in the euro zone. Negotiations to form a coalition government ended without results Sunday. The heads of the three top parties--plus the small, moderate Democratic Left party--have been invited by Greek President Karolos Papoulias for fresh talks Monday at 1630 GMT.

&gt; ""The price would be very high if they decided to leave the euro,"" Schaeuble told pupils during a visit of a French high school in Berlin. Such a move would result in a devaluation of a new Greek currency and also in an impoverishment of the Greek people.

&gt; This decision would also impact markets' assessment of the euro zone as a whole, he warned.

&gt; ""This would mean a lot of turmoils for us,"" Schaeuble said, adding the euro zone is currently in a volatile situation.

&gt; Greece has been awarded two bailout packages to help stave off bankruptcy. Austerity measures introduced as part of the first EUR110 billion bailout plan have taken a heavy toll on the country's economic activity and depressed consumption. The second bailout plan approved in March amounts to EUR130 billion--funded mostly by euro-zone countries and the International Monetary Fund.

&gt; In comments directed at French President Elect Francois Hollande, Schaeuble said Europe's fiscal pact for tougher budget rules can't be changed and he should know it's a done deal.

&gt; Hollande is due to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday. The German leader has lobbied hard to install tougher budget rules in Europe in a bid to get the area's sovereign debt crisis under control.

&gt; Hollande has vowed to renegotiate a fiscal compact that 25 of the 27 European Union leaders agreed in March. The pact commits members to limiting deficits and debt. Hollande wants to include references to economic growth in the pact, a position interpreted by many as a way to soften the stance of the EU on government profligacy.

&gt; Commenting on the issue of who should be next to lead the Eurogroup of euro-zone finance ministers, Schaeuble said he opposes suggestions to create a full-time position for the post.

&gt; Schaeuble is one of the front-runners to succeed current Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker who has held the position since it was created in 2005. The position is seen crucial in the area's struggle to overcome the sovereign debt crisis.",0,1337011112,null,0,false,0,c4nw8lj,t3_tmk7k,t1_c4nw8lj,t3_tmk7k,null,1428922504,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

You guys have seen this before... lots of uncertainty over the results of something, then suddenly someone just says ""nvm, nothing bad is gonna happen"" and everyone goes quiet again for a few months. Just because Greeks are backing pro-growth parties does not mean that they will immediately quit the euro to achieve that.

Forget all of the crap being said by mainstream politicians in Greece right now, they just want votes. Once the politicians are finished stabbing eachother in public, and someone sits down on the golden throne and gets told what the realities are, he's just gonna end up doing what everyone else has been doing... a couple of vocal euroskeptics will start screaming that ""they got to him"", exactly like the time when David Cameron suddenly went quiet after a small ""I'm sticking it to europe"" phase. None of us truly understand the realities of what is going on behind the scenes -- all these people have much more information than you, me or the press. Do you honestly believe that so many countries would be sticking to their guns on this crap if they didn't have solid information on why this must happen?

Like many people mentioned, even if they quit the eurozone, they'd need money from other EU countries to get things back on track.. Do you think the countries will be willing to help a country that went out with a big public event of 'fuck the euro and the germans' ? We can argue that either way, Greece will suffer.. I do not like this at all -- so don't make me out to be some asshole that wants Greece to suffer -- I don't. In fact.. if we spent all of this energy screaming for them to create the eurobonds instead of 1000000 articles/discussions on Greece quitting the euro, then maybe this shit would end much quicker.

Most of these newspapers just want to make money by selling shock and surprise to people... right after they're finished announcing the big event of Greece leaving the eurozone, they'll then proceed to making new articles about hunger and civil war in Greece with lots of fingers to be pointed... and the euroskeptics will be at it at again..

true,Oda_Krell,EURO,"German, living in the Netherlands","Had you chosen another title, and argued in a different tone in the comment section, I would have supported you. Like this, however, I do not, and I'm questioning the honesty of your argumentation.

At face value, your overview seems to be correct (even though I didn't check the actual numbers against official sources). I would even say it's helpful, as a reminder. Also, in my opinion, the *per capita* comparison is in fact relevant, despite what some commenters said on here, that we should only talk about the total amount offered per country.

However, here's the basic problem with your presentation: This is old news for me. And, I'm quite sure, for pretty much everyone on r/Europe who is at least semi-informed. I have never seen a (popular) thread on this subreddit that would claim otherwise. If you would somehow manage to place your data in German BILD-Zeitung, you would do God's/Feynman's work, but posting it here means you're just preaching to the choir.

Which by itself wouldn't even be a big deal: I would have just shrugged it off as something I already knew. But that's not the only thing you wrote. There's also an insinuation, which becomes transparent in your comments, and your polemic title: you don't *actually* want to address the uninformed BILD or RTL News-reading part of Germany. I mean, how on earth would you expect those people to subscribe to this subreddit anyway, written in English, built around (most of the time) serious political discourse.

No, in reality, you are trying to manipulate the opinion against the ""pro-German crowd"". Those of us who are in favor of austerity, budget cuts and ""conservative"" fiscal policies. People who are maybe not happy with everything Merkel and her allies do, but who are generally inclined to support her policies in response to the crisis.

I claim you're building a strawman, that goes more or less like this: ""(German) Austerity supporters believe Greece should severely reduce their spending or leave the Euro, because they are sick of paying alone for the bailout. But they are wrong, because other countries pay just as much per capita. Hence, their demand for austerity is wrong.""

Sorry, but that's not how it works. Believe me, I am well aware that other EU nations pay just as much (per capita) as Germany for the bailout. And, not surprisingly, people in some of those countries are just as restless about what seems to be a bottomless hole for their money as voters in Germany -- for example in the Netherlands. Completely unrelated to this fact, and acknowledging it, some of us still believe that there is no alternative to austerity measures. (Sidenote: I personally think the austerity measures should continue, but could now be flanked by temporary, moderate growth spending. But that's a different, unrelated matter.)

Like I said in the beginning, stating factual information about the German per capita contribution is only fair. Saying that the populist media in Germany should keep those numbers in mind is justified a well. But if you, between the lines, present this fact as if it generally makes pro-austerity positions undefendable, then you are either naive, or, worse, manipulative.

 

**P.S.** If you would have made the more nuanced statement ""This data (about per capita contribution) should be more widely known in Germany, because even German *quality* newspapers sometimes fall into the trap of presenting the bailout funding only from a German perspective"", I would have agreed with you. But you didn't do that. Instead you chose a polemic, less nuanced presentation. As a consequence, you can't complain now if my response is calling you out on that.


**P.P.S.** You could also ask how I got the impression that you are trying to say any of this strawman argument, ""between the lines"" stuff. And I would be happy to provide evidence. Just one example, of you linking the mistaken belief of some Germans that they are ""the paymaster"" with the (unrelated) claim that austerity has failed: 

&gt;According to the poll (and the opinion of the German Finance Minister), it's the German way or no way. While the German way failed spectacularly (not blaming individuals, but the cabinet), because recession was much higher than projected and the effects could not be contained, the German views increasingly lean on the ""we pay, you follow"" mentality. You might disagree, but the view on the street is that the Germans pay too much and the results are not good, that's why they should withdraw. They never realised that a) they pay their share, nothing more, nothing less, and b) the program has failed because it was the wrong prescription.",0,1337014699,null,0,false,0,c4nx0mv,t3_tlt5f,t1_c4nx0mv,t3_tlt5f,null,1428922880,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,MeteorPhoenix,PUER,Puerto Rico,"&gt; The West Lothian question does make for a democratic deficit. The reason it hasn't been sorted out is that Scotland, Wales and NI only devolved recently and Labour relied on Scottish MPs to pass legislation. It is now being looked at seriously. One suggestion is to create an English parliament, another is to require English specific legislation to rquire a double majority.

But it does prove that a democratic deficit does not necessarily imply that the system is, on the whole, undemocratic. All systems have unforeseen flaws.

Off-topic, has anything actually been done so far? It seemed to have faded into the background.

&gt; There are just about enough people who feel Spanish in Catalan and Basque country to make it work, refurendums to leave a union would be denied. Belgium doesn't work as a country, its parliament has barely any legitimacy and they can't pass laws.

Is that true, though? I wouldn't make a bet that the Basque Country would for sure vote to stay, and neither would I do so for Scotland (though the union side does seem to be larger). Moreover, iirc, both Flanders and Walloons want to remain as Belgium, no?

It seems to me that the differences between the EU and Spain aren't that many (never mind that Spain has the areas it has mostly by force).

&gt; Labour and the Conservatives both offered refurendums on UK membership of the EU, none of them have gone actually gone through with their manifesto promises. The idea was scrapped in the coalition agreement but will probably reemerge if the Conservative gain an absolute majority next election. Ed Balls shadow chancellor tweeted today that he wanted to offer a refurendum in the near future.

The way I understood it, while the majority of the UK would vote to leave the EU, it's not a vote-deciding issue compared to the economy and whatnot, so politicians don't feel pressured to address it.

&gt; Why should the EU be all or nothing? Why should the UK have to accept legislation that is potentially damaging. When the UK joined it was on the treaty of rome criteria - it didn't join this modern beurocratic monolith. Why would the UK want to be all in the EU, if it had plunged head first towards integration I can guarentee that the Euro crisis would have been far worse for one thing.

Simply because the EU has changed. It is no longer merely a free trade area. Certainly no one has the right to kick the UK out, nor should they, but looking from the outside in, the UK does seem rather petulant when you read news about how much they blast the EU and veto all the things, yet don't want to give their eurosceptic people a referendum either.

What's your objective here? That the EU remain a regular free trade area? That's gone forever. The reason it's all or nothing is because what you joined no longer exists. You have a choice between part of what *does* exist (a proto-federation seeking further integration), or leaving it. I would personally see the UK alongside France and Germany leading the EU, but you don't seem to want that, so ultimately, it's up to the British to do what they will.

&gt; I didn't say ""never"" on purpose. It only survives at the moment in its present form because it just about skirts around the issue of natioanal sovereignty. Further attempts to integrate might not.

Depending on how the Greece situation plays out, this might lead to a fiscal union, and most experts seem to think that a fiscal union inevitably leads to a political union.",0,1337015035,null,0,false,0,c4nx3fr,t3_tjd3j,t1_c4nx3fr,t1_c4nv9uk,null,1428922908,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I'm not sure that's quite true though - what the elections looked like to me was a huge down-vote for all parties that have ruled them previously. naturally, that will imply flourishing of various marginal and extremist options - what else is there to fill up the vacuum? 

Another is utter fragmentation. Pro-austerity parties too actually had a good if minority showing. Maybe that's confusion, maybe just uncertainty as to which of the minor options have decent chances, maybe debate or conflict.

And finally, the biggest gains go to a left-of-centre anti-austerity party. That seems perfectly predictable, in a poor economic situation, blamed on the austerity programme.

None of these are either unreasonable reactions, if we grant that the austerity drive was either a bad idea or on too short a timetable (I have some inclination to the second position, though I mainly feel it was a solid approach and a decent change given to the Greeks, just one intentionally subverted by the political forces, as this article too claims), not particularly unexpected, or even damaging, in comparison to what we saw of their political status quo.

In essence, your argument boils down to this:

Saying that the populist media in Germany should keep those numbers in mind is justified a well. But if you, between the lines, present this fact as if it generally makes pro-austerity positions undefendable, then you are either naive, or, worse, manipulative.

I'm glad that you use conditional sentences (""if...""), because you might misinterpret what was written. :)

For many Germans, their current state of mind is this: ""we helped Greeks, they should do whatever it takes or we should stop, we pay too much.""

A series of logical fallacies.

Everything is interconnected. These arguments are repeated ad infinitum in public and private discussions. There is only one way to turn the tables around: a) show them hard data, and b) convince them that a change of plans serves their interests.

Those arguing that rushed, extreme austerity programs pay off, find themselves in the minority; all indicators are against that. The deficit might be down, but at what price? Threatening to destroy the social cohesion? Contributing to the rise of demagogy and extreme parties? Doubling the projected recession? I'm afraid that there are no positive signs in that process.

But there's also the possibility to withdraw unilaterally, for which no details are specified other than it has to be in accordance to the constitution of the country that is declaring its exit. Essentially, you're out when you say so. Whether the Greek constitution permits this somehow while there is no elected government, I don't know. 

That aside, the problem is that scenario might suddenly develop which would make it necessary to reintroduce the drachma ASAP. (Edit to say that I don't think it's likely, just that there is a risk.)

If you are looking to explore other towns in the area I highly recommend Bamberg. It's an hour away by train (use the bayernticket to get around in Bavaraia) and is one of the most beautiful towns in Germany. There are only 70000 people, but they have 8 breweries (no giant factories, basically just little restaurants with their own beer) a cathedral that celebrated it's 1000 year birthday a couple weeks ago, and an old town center that wasn't bombed during the war leaving it in its magestic beauty. There is a state wide [garden show](http://www.bamberg2012.de/web/en/index.php) going on right now, if you are interested in that stuff, it's worth checking out. You can easily explore Bamberg in one or two days. The beer culture in Bamberg is really awesome, you drink beer all day long but not to get drunk, just to enjoy the taste, so don't be shocked if you see people hanging around in the breweries at 11am. I'd recommend the ""Schlenkerla"" it's in the center of Bamberg. Their specialty is the Rauchbier, smoked beer, which literally tastes like smoked ham. Not everybody likes it but it is worth checking out

 You could also check out Würzburg, also an hour away by train, a bit bigger than Bamberg, and famous for its wine. It's not as pretty as Bamberg though. For hiking check out the [Fränkische Schweiz](http://www.google.com/search?q=bamberg&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:de:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=ulaxT4moE83ssgaWv92hBA&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=624&amp;sei=vVaxT-z4BIPQsga44oCvBg#um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:de%3Aofficial&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=fr%C3%A4nkische+schweiz&amp;oq=fr%C3%A4nkische+schweiz&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1g-m1g-S4g-mS4&amp;aql=1&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i5j0i24l4j0i5i24l4.241393.247180.0.247474.24.18.3.0.0.1.890.6672.0j1j3j9j3j1j1.18.0.gsihc.1.0.0.fAsOX3-nJVk&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=f6c590b72be3dc96&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=624), that's also not really far from Nürnberg, it's really scenic and there are tons of hiking trails.

right, they can leave the EU whenever they wish - such type of international treaties can be unilaterally broken off regardless of whether the treaty itself has provisions for this or not.

I meant, leaving the eurozone w/o leaving the EU. 

&gt; Whether the Greek constitution permits this somehow while there is no elected government, I don't know. 

I would expect it could be done in any parliamentary democracy, since the previous government functions as a technical government until the new one is formed, and in any case, repealing a treaty is I think something the parliament does, not a government, and neither does the latter have any monopoly of initiative, so...

&gt;That aside, the problem is that scenario might suddenly develop which would make it necessary to reintroduce the drachma ASAP.

Well, the more likely scenario of such exit would be a matter of whether the Greek government chooses to do so or not - as things stand, eurozone has ensured enough cash to keep Greece off the markets for some years now, provided they continue implementing the unpopular austerity measures.

But yeah, if the perception is that the new government will choose to do this, I can see a bank run happening. Can ECB ensure enough liquidity in such case ? - I mean, as long as they are a member, its ECB's main task as a central bank to react against such dangers, no?

So in any case, in this scenario, the only thing that stops the insecurity whether it will happen or not, is for it to finally happen, because confidence in any proclamation to the contrary is already destroyed. Or, what happens if the banking system does implode in this manner and no currency is changed after all?

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hi, Switzerland here.  It's still much friendlier to freelancers (e.g. none of the ""Scheinselbstständigkeit"" nonsense) but has been getting increasingly tough as of late.  One of the first moves to start screwing independent contractors was a rule that charged people with company cars something like 3% of the _new_ value of a car in tax every year  (even if you bought a used car for your firm).  

Expense rulings are much much more liberal though.  So if you get the chance, I'd definitely consider making the move.

_Edit:_ there is no way he is paying ""a bit over 10%"".  Taxes in Switzerland break down into

- income tax (local, cantonal, federal)
- mandatory state-run defined-benefit social contributions (AHV) - a percentage of income
- mandatory state-run insurance (IV and a few other letters I forget) - a percentage of AHV
- mandatory private-run retirement fund (BVG)

On top of this he is required to have (private) health insurance (although that could be an HMO).

As a freelancer, he's paying both mandatory employer and employee-side AHV and BVG; at minimum that is around 20% total of gross income, split between employee and employer, in this case himself (so he's costing his company about 110% of gross salary).  They've also gotten quite strict about salary and expenses - if you're paying yourself less than, say, 3-4k CHF a month but still have a decent lifestyle, the tax people will get curious.  And if you are drawing more than around 20-25% of your gross salary in expenses from your company, you'll have to really start justifying it

So even in a very low-tax canton like Schwyz or Zug, he's going to pay about 5-10% base income tax rate (local/cantonal/federal) on a rock-bottom salary, and I assume that especially a freelancer will pay himself more than that because any money he leaves in the company gets taxed at 12-25% corporate tax (depending on canton).  Add to that the mandatory social costs and you're looking at around 20% easy.

My advice is to find a hotel near one of the metro stops along the number 11 line, the number 1 line, or the number 4 line.  The metro is by far the cheapest and fastest way to travel so long as you will not be requiring commute after midnight or one am, I forget which.  Check www.ratp.fr for maps, stations, rates, and hours.

I personally enjoyed the metro while I have been here in Paris.  It took me a lot longer to figure out compared to New York's or London's tubes, but it's still awesome and gets you everywhere you need to be.

As far as hotels go, you will pretty much pay €80 (~100) a night unless to get lucky, find a shit-hole, have a discount card, or know somebody who works for a hotel and can get you a discount.

Apartments can be found for as low as €380 a week at places like Hôtel Les Chansonniers.  But deals like that are pretty rare and the reliability and quality is not known to me.  Try a site like paris35.com.  I can't vouch for its legitimacy, but it seems okay.

There can unforeseen problems with democratic deficit in some country's systems but the EU ones are very much foreseen.

In Europe some countries such as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland stay out of the EU but are members of the common market. The question that the British were asked in 1975 was ""Do you think the UK should stay in the European Community (Common Market)?"" It was not do you think Britain should cede soverignty to a European federal state. Why can't Britain leave the EU but remain in the Common Market? Britain is a large market for nearly all European states. France and Germany still need the UK to sell their wine and cars to. The majority of european financial transactions take place in London - it would be very dangerous for the EU to cut off ties if we were to leave. The countries in the EU would remain our allies as well. Anglo-Franco military cooperation would still be there for example. Britain wouldn't loose much from leaving. 

Most experts are obsessed with an area of political science called (neo-)functionionalism. It was popular in the mid-50s through to the early 60s and gained a new vogue in the mid-90s when people thought it was working. I can't open a journal without another article criticising it. Also most experts also believe that fiscal union without political union is impossible, not the converse. The hope was that the Euro would integrate countries enough economically so that political union would happen through spill-over. That simply hasn't happened. 

The UK parties refusing to give refurendum is deeply immoral. However the UK does not regularly use its veto. It often decides to opt out of legislation but the only example I can think of it even threatening to use a veto is in the case of the Fiscal Union which would have been deeply detrimental to the UK, opened it up to foreign taxation (an unworkable Tobin Tax that would have fallen disproportionately on London), and would have given additional powers to EU instutions to dictate policy in the UK. That is hardly petulent. There is also a UK threat to use the veto alongside the Dutch to veto Iceland's accession to the EU. They owe the UK and Dutch depositors £4bn after their banking system blew up under the terms of international financial regulation that they signed up to. You can debate the rightness and wrongness of that all you want but it hardly a willynilly use of veto.

If the EU is as you say a proto-federal system I would perfer to be out. If we have to be in one I would prefer it to be exclusively with the Northern European countries like the scandinavians, the dutch, some of the eastern bloc countries like Poland, Lavia and the Czech republic and Germany.

I agree, but it's not sure enough that the government won't campaign against it. There's still some nervousness.

&gt; In Europe some countries such as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland stay out of the EU but are members of the common market. The question that the British were asked in 1975 was ""Do you think the UK should stay in the European Community (Common Market)?""

The countries in the EU would remain our allies as well. Anglo-Franco military cooperation would still be there for example. Britain wouldn't loose much from leaving.

Well, there's a price for that; what they call fax democracy. Do you want to wait for orders from Brussels without being involved in their crafting? Because that's what the non-EU European states have to do.

&gt; The UK parties refusing to give refurendum is deeply immoral. However the UK does not regularly use its veto. It often decides to opt out of legislation but the only example I can think of it even threatening to use a veto is in the case of the Fiscal Union which would have been deeply detrimental to the UK, opened it up to foreign taxation (an unworkable Tobin Tax that would have fallen disproportionately on London), and would have given additional powers to EU instutions to dictate policy in the UK.

You can debate the rightness and wrongness of that all you want but it hardly a willynilly use of veto.

That's fair enough; I exaggerated a little, but the mere power of a veto is enough to prevent ideas and legislation from even coming about. Would I be wrong to say that, if a new treaty was formed seeking further EU integration, the UK would be the leading voice of the veto camp, if not the only voice?

From the outside, it seems as if the UK is holding the rest of the EU back from becoming a federation. Or this was the view before this whole clusterfuck with Greece changed the focus.

And the parties not giving the referendum is just good politics. Again, the majority of people would vote to leave the EU (which most people think would be bad), but the British simply care so little about it that the parties can just ignore it.

&gt; If the EU is as you say a proto-federal system I would perfer to be out. If we have to be in one I would prefer it to be exclusively with the Northern European countries like the scandinavians, the dutch, some of the eastern bloc countries like Poland, Lavia and the Czech republic and Germany.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; Greece has since restructured most of the private debt, where many people made a decent profit. Old bonds were trading at 30% of their value. They bought them, accepted a 53,5% reduction, and took back 15% in cash. IIF was happy. Now THAT'S what I call a great deal!

Good for those hedge funds who managed to turn the ""restructuring"" into a profit. Unfortunate for the many whose retirement funds had helt Greek bonds or whose fees will have to make up for what their insurances have lost in the largest default in history.

I've simply noted that the figures in that graph weren't accurate anymore because they're from before the default. You choose to reply to that with ""Now THAT'S what I call a great deal!"" polemics because some rich guys may have made a profit? In those cases where they've made a profit, this means that somebody must have made an even bigger loss than what they normally would have. There's only one party who has managed to save €100bn in this deal. A great deal indeed.

&gt; However, this transaction (again imposed my Merkel's cabinet, which has since changed its opinion) made little difference.

You seriously hold it against her that she coerced the banks into ""voluntarily restructuring"" Greece's debt? Which opinion change are you even referring to? And yeah, €100bn that don't have to be payed back… peanuts, right?

&gt; Writing off €100b, borrowing €130b and keep pumping money to insolvent European banks? Now THAT'S another great deal!

Ah, you must be referring to the €49bn that were used to bail out the Greek banks that needed recapitalization because one of their debtors had gone into default.

Or what is it you're trying to say? That this is just a cunning plan to bail out banks through the back door? Because what hadn't been used to cover Greece's enormous deficit over the past two years indeed goes into stabilizing the European financial system by transferring Greek debt to the European public, essentially socializing the remaining €100bn still held by the private sector after the €100bn that Greece has already defaulted on. If we wouldn't do that, then some countries that have enough problems on their own right now would have to bail out their banks. Not greedy investment banks that had bought highly speculative instruments to make huge profits for their rich clients, like after that shit went down in the US, but normal business banks that bought Greek bonds that, on average, yielded just a quarter percent more than German ones before the crisis hit. That's what banks buy when they value security over profits, not something speculators waste their time with. And those banks are actually needed, if they're gone then healthy businesses lose access to capital, go belly up, and real people lose their jobs.  
And no, for the most part, those aren't German banks. Have another look at that pre-default graph from above. Deutsche Bank has about half a billion left. Commerzbank has €4.7bn to go -- from all of the GIIPS *combined*. By far the largest share is held by FMS Wertmanagement. If you haven't heard about them, that's because they're just the bad bank set up in the process of the HypoReal collapse after the previous crisis, and it's already 100% government owned -- more than €8bn of the default therefore went straight out of German taxpayers' pockets. The German share of the bailout could easily cover the remainder several times over, if they even had to be bailed out, which practically all of them wouldn't.  
Now, have another look at that graph. Do you notice something? No, not France. Some French banks would probably be inconvenienced if they had to write off their remaining Greek debt, but most could take it, and France could easily afford to cover the rest. Not Portugal, either, although that *would* be a problem. No, it's Greece, that bar is simply missing from the graph. Not surprisingly, Greek banks had bought the lion's share of Greek bonds, that's where most of those remaining privately held €100bn sit. And they can't afford to write it off, which is why €49bn of the bailout fund had to be used to bail them out after the €100bn default.

There will be a delay, depending on the country. I have not yet seen which countries will introduce what transitional periods - I don't think it has been announced yet, since its not part of the accession treaty, but up for each state to decide. (or if what the treaty says re transnational measures is everything then, wee, yay!)

I would guess most or all will use the 2 year transitional period where the citizens of the new country aren't treated as other EU  citizens in the labour market. After that, they can take another 3 year period, and if they claim some extreme impact or whatever, can demand yet another 2 years after that, for a maximum of 7 years. This last option was for eg used by Germany and Austria&lt;EDIT&gt;and many others&lt;/EDIT&gt; for Bulgaria and Romania, but not generally. Sweden otoh hasn't used any transitional periods for countries that have joined till then. Various countries just used the initial 2 year period. 

So, I'm hoping that, given how this is a very small EU expansion compared to the past two eastern European waves, &lt;EDIT&gt;how Croatia had a more demanding accession process, so should be more prepared than most new members, esp the last two, and how even these past two waves of expansion&lt;/EDIT&gt; generated less migration than was expected, I might have a decent destination in 2 years, or even immediately.",0,1337073090,null,0,1337085173,0,c4o8c7l,t3_tmdin,t1_c4o8c7l,t1_c4o8a89,null,1428928273,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Ah, I see. No, you're right, there is no procedure to leave the Eurozone without leaving the EU. I guess they could just make it possible, but I doubt the EU would bend over backwards to keep Greece in the union if it came to that. It would mean having to deal with an emigration wave the resulting chaos, so I suspect the EU would limit itself to trying to prevent a failed state from emerging at its door instead of risking to have one on the inside.

&gt; I would expect it could be done in any parliamentary democracy

Possibly. In any case, the events would preempt the legal details if it came to that, if Greece needed capital controls they would enforce them whether they'd technically still be listed as a member or not.

&gt; Well, the more likely scenario of such exit would be a matter of whether the Greek government chooses to do so or not

Yeah, I think so, too. What's worrying me is that we can't be sure, and the present situation without a functioning government makes this uncontrolled scenario all the more threatening. Greece will have a political power vacuum for at least another month, whether it will have a functioning government after that is doubtful, and even the best case scenario would be an instable coalition of opposing forces playing power games with each other while going into a confrontation course against the Troika.

&gt; Can ECB ensure enough liquidity in such case ? - I mean, as long as they are a member, its ECB's main task as a central bank to react against such dangers, no?

Well, the ECB sure is hawkish on inflation, but the implied primary function of a central bank is to make sure there's a working currency to begin with. I assume they would turn out to be surprisingly flexible and pragmatic if it came to that.

&gt; Or, what happens if the banking system does implode in this manner and no currency is changed after all?

Usually what people do in such a situation is to barter for food, and if there's a power vacuum at the time then one player or another will try to seize control.

They funded an ill-designed plan that a) destroyed Greece's faltering economy, b) increased Greece's debt, c) sent healthy banks to the red zone, and d) endangered the global economy.

In reality, it would be cheaper to pay back most or all of Greece's debt from the beginning ([graph 1](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/HellenicOeconomy%28inCurrentEuros%29.png), [graph 2](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Greece_public_debt_1999-2010.svg/500px-Greece_public_debt_1999-2010.svg.png)), while Greece put its house in order. Even just the amount of the first loan agreement between Greece and other Eurozone partners at the time (the one that started this discussion), would help lowering Greece's debt to GDP ratio  below 100%. Then the EU would save the world from two years of misery, Greece would not be cut off from the markets, Portugal and Ireland would not follow through, bond rates would not go through the roof, and recession would not reach levels that  are observed only after a war.

Regarding my thoughts about the ""extreme"" scenario, here's how I see it. Changing the national currency would take time (at least six months). But even then, the (new) drachma would devalue, maybe 40-50% for starters, reaching 60-70% after a year. It's better to postpone paying back some instalments and take a hit that would only have short-term effects, while negotiating with other EU partners. In any case, the ""extreme"" scenario won't happen.

As far as experience is concerned, I'll argue the other way around. With the current pace of change in the means of production, workers that have just entered the marketplace are more apt to to new production methodologies. This is evident in most of the tech sector (over 40's are considered old).

Here's the backstory. My paternal grandfather (b. 1914) emigrated to New Zealand from abject poverty in Liverpool in the 20's, as a teenager. His father (my Great Grandad) died when my Grandad was little. Grandad (d. 1982) was always regarded as a bit of a romanticist by our family. He maintained his Dad was killed on Armistice Day in WW1, in the merchant marine, and sunk by a U-boat.

A cousin from Liverpool came out to NZ in the 60's and poored scorn on that - he said Great Grandad returned home to Liverpool from a voyage, missed the last ferry across the Mersey to Seacombe, tried to swim instead, and was run down by a ferry and drowned.

Grandad's mum (my Great Grandmother), being unfeasibly poor by modern standards, fell in with a new man. A violent alcoholic. He used to routinely beat my Great Grandmother (I can only imagine sickeningly violently - I suspect law and order was a different story for the poor in the Liverpool slums back then).

When my Grandad was in his teens, he reached a point where he had had enough of this shit. He waited behind a door for his step-father to come home one night, drunk and punchy. The man arrived home, full of the usual alcoholic hatred and bellowing and ready to take my Great Grandma to pieces for the millionth time - and Grandad jumped him and smashed the guy's head in with a hammer.

The man apparently came from a family of hard-cases. Thugs. *Real* thugs, not the poseur wanna-be gangsters we see today. They set about to take revenge on my Grandad. Meanwhile, Grandad's uncles (brothers, I guess, of the my Great Grandad drowned either in war or in the Mersey), were also very hard men. Bare knuckle street/prize fighters. They hid Grandad around various houses until they could get him out of Liverpool - forever, as it turned out.

They got him on a ship to New Zealand. He settled here, happily, it seemed, raised a family of four children (my Dad being the eldest, now in his 70's), fought in WW2, and although I never knew him as well as I wished, he always fascinated me. He had a really hard streak deep within him. There was some kind of fierce loyalty deep inside his quiet exterior that just *burned*.

As the internet grew over the last few decades, I've dabled on and off with finding out more about this family history. I've always drawn a blank, and given up. Then I'll randomly google around again out of the blue, and usually come up empty handed.

Until last week. When I found my Great Grandad's name on a list of drowned seamen from the *SS Barrister*, sunk by UB-64 on Sept 19, 1918, 9 nautical miles South West of the Isle of Man. En route with cargo from Glasgow and Liverpool, to the West Indies. 30 souls lost.

And then, someone sent me this U-boat KTB.

Incredibly, I then found a thumbnail picture of my Great Grandad on a genealogy website. I sat there staring at him with my mouth agape. The family resemblance is uncanny.

My Dad, Uncle and two aunts, are I think deeply, deeply moved to know that their Dad was telling the truth the whole time. Grandad always said his lineal ancestors were all seamen. Ironically, I too am a sailor and earn my living this way (yachting).

So I'm determined to put as many pieces of the family puzzle together, and assemble a permanent record for my entire family to keep, and especially too, for my own children to have for when they are adults maybe with family of their own (my little boy shares the same initials as my Grandad &amp; Great Grandad).

Also we need to stop transferring their debt to the governments, so they don't grow into such huge money gambling corporations.

Basically what happen now was the banks fucked up cause we let them fuck up..and they said look if we fail everything goes to shit so the governments bailed them out putting them self into huge debs  and letting the banks continue to do the same shit they've been doing for the last 30 40 years.

Thing will not change just like that...just cause we wish...some bad things are gonna happen...all of these corporations will eventually fail cause the governments  will stop bailing them out then some of the countries will default on their huuuuuge debs then probably in 10 20 year things will start to improve...but it's gonna get a lot worse till then...so buckle up

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"The way I see it, it happened to be Papandreou's turn to be PM when the hit from the financial crisis resulted in reality catching up with the previous governments' accounting, both PASOK's and ND's, because he was just unlucky to be there when it blew up. He did what he could at this point, but his party eroded from under his feet and Samaras just saw it as an opportunity to damage his opponent with an eye on the next election. Initially, Venizelos tried the same thing internally, and now we have SYRIZA playing that game. Greek politics seems to consist of nothing but making populist promises and boycotting whoever is leading the country in an attempt to raise up the chain. I think history will look kindly on Papandreous, if only because he had already been at the top and was left with no other choices.

&gt; But what happened after that, was not good for the German and other EU taxpayers. I care for them. They funded an ill-designed plan that a) destroyed Greece's faltering economy, b) increased Greece's debt, c) sent healthy banks to the red zone, and d) endangered the global economy.

What they did was to fund a plan that a) kept Greece's economy from collapsing, b) reduced Greece's debt by €100bn, c) prevented a collapse of the financial system of both Greece and the Eurozone, and d) gave the global economy time to decouple from Greece to reduce the impact should Greece end up in total default.

&gt; In reality, it would be cheaper to pay back most or all of Greece's debt from the beginning

That's exactly what's happening. By far the largest share of Greek debt has already been transferred onto the European public, much of it has been written off, and the remaining €100bn will be slowly rolled over as well. I think I've explained how this works in my previous reply well enough.

&gt; Even just the amount of the first loan agreement between Greece and other Eurozone partners at the time (the one that started this discussion), would help lowering Greece's GDP below 100%. Then the EU would save the world from two years of misery, Greece would not be cut off from the markets, Portugal and Ireland would not follow through, bond rates would not go through the roof, and recession would not reach levels that are observed only after a war.

Portugal might have managed without a bailout and Italy could have kept dragging its feet, but Spain and Ireland fell victim to their collapsing real estate markets. Ireland had a giant bank bailout on top of that, and while they started out on very low levels of debt, they had a 14% deficit in 2009 and even 31% in 2010. For them, the trigger was the financial crisis in the US in combination with a housing bubble that they had developed themselves, not Greece.

What you seem to be proposing is the European public should have just payed off the share of Greek debt that went above 100% GDP. As I've explained before, this is essentially what's happening -- just that you seem to be proposing that Greece shouldn't have to pay it back. I'll talk more about this later, let's get into the practical side of this first.  
Politics in the donor countries aside, because I think you can imagine how unpopular this would have been with the European tax payers you so much care for, the way to do this is to simply pay the bonds when they come due, which incidentally is exactly what's been happening for two years and will be for the foreseeable future. If you remember, those were bonds that had been emitted when Greek interest rates were lower than what most European countries could borrow at at the time. You'd also have to explain to Belgium, Italy and Ireland why the European public (including in those countries and others that had problems of their own) would take over that share of Greek debt but they were expected to pay theirs back on their own. Greece is not a unique pretty flower that deserves special treatment, and the public would have perceived this as rewarding Greece for creative accounting. It also would have done nothing for the Greek deficit -- 10% in 2008, over 15% in 2009, and when austerity measures cut that deficit to still over 10% in 2010 rioters had already burned three bank employees alive. Only a negligible part of those deficits were due to increased interest rates, because this only affected new bonds, and even at a debt load of ""only"" 100% GDP they would have remained on the same level. (Those 30% yields you may have been hearing about were from the secondary market when Greece had long been cut out of the market and exclusively relied on the bailout funds for financing.)  
But let's say the European tax payer would have gone with the more expensive option, and bough Greek bonds on the secondary market. Greece now owes 100% GDP to the market, and the rest to an EU facility, because that's where those bonds that the public bought would have ended up. If this sounds just like the current situation, that's because it is, only that we wouldn't have gotten the banks to agree to the ""restructuring"". What you appear to suggest is that, at this point, we should have just torn up the bonds and all would have been fine. Did I get this right?

Well, no, it would not have. Remember, Greece still has an enormous deficit, even in this scenario. A year later, we're back at 110% GDP. Do we do the same thing again? Buy 10% GDP worth of bonds on the secondary market, and again tear them up? What in the year after that? And while Spaniards would have taking comfort in the knowledge that the EU would pick up the tab once they hit 100% themselves, the Belgians, Italians, Irish and Portugese must be feeling pretty stupid at this point. Then again, we could just do the same for them. I'm sure we could keep this up for at least three years, if not longer, before the last Eurozone country hits 100%. We'll work something out when we get there, I guess.

Anyway, let's assume that the other GIIPS don't expect the same treatment, and get their house in order none the less, with or without help from other countries. That's not even too far off, because while I'm sure that they'd appreciate more help and especially more time, they've come a long way and they do tackle their problems. But what would Greece do? Grow its way out, because now that debt has been effectively locked at 100% GDP, interest rates will be low and the economy will kick into full gear?  
I don't think so. 100% of GDP may be an important psychological line, but interest rates don't work this way. That's why Belgium can sustain its debt, not to mention Japan, and that's also why Spain has to pay that much to borrow even though debt is still low. It's about deficits, and even more so about future ability to repay. So, yes, interest rates for Greece would indeed be low, but only because the EU would scrap up what it could get hold of on the secondary market, according to the program you seem to propose, maybe slightly above the Eurozone average (not less, because countries have to borrow the money themselves, and slightly more, because there's always the risk the by then very powerful populist anti-bailout parties would make keeping this up difficult). Again, that's exactly what we have now.

So, same situation as now -- the European public buys Greek debt, Greece pays essentially what the Eurozone countries pay in interest themselves, only that the banks wouldn't have written off €100bn ""voluntarily"", Greece nominally would have only 100% debt, the actual bailout figures would be lowered by the amount that Greece now has to pay to service the debt that the European public owns, i.e., that it practically pays to itself. That, and that the European taxpayer would have no legal right to demand getting payed back, and of course that quite a lot of people would be feeling really stupid.

How are the odds the Greek political elite would get to work on the problems that Greece actually has, and that the public would support them, if Europe essentially told them that all new debt would be covered? Greece wouldn't miraculously become competitive even if the EU would make huge amounts of capital available at a very low cost. That Greece had access to too much cheap capital is what got us into this mess in the first place. And from what I've seen, I very much doubt there could be a Greek government that would enact reforms and reduce spending without being able to blame it on the SS holding a gun to their heads.

As a side note:

&gt; Regarding my thoughts about the ""extreme"" scenario, here's how I see it. Changing the national currency would take time (at least six months).

It would take a weekend. If Greece exits while banks are open, all hell breaks loose. Don't expect any pretty brochures or design competitions that would tip people off that the worth of their savings and assets will get cut in half if they keep them in Greece. There is no way to do this orderly, not if the new currency is expected to get devaluated. Let's hope it won't get to that.",0,1337091297,null,0,1337091901,0,c4oa48p,t3_tlt5f,t1_c4oa48p,t1_c4o8mqp,null,1428929110,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The sentence should be just and fair, proportional to the crime he did commit, but that does not mean that the judge should shake hands with him, or he should be let to boast about his theories. Or that he should do a raised hand salute. There are subtle differences in treating someone in a humane way, but still restraining him. 

As it stands now, Breivik is quite happy with his situation and with the possible outcome of the trial. He does not regret killing those people, seems like he achieved his goal. A happy mass murderer. Way to go Norway. What's the point of punishing him then, and what will hold back the next Breivik from doing the same?

No, he might did what he thought he should or could do, but he was wrong. He already had discussions with Strauss-Kahn (then Head of IMF) before the elections. He lied about it in public. DSK said that when Greece called, everything was set up in 15 days, because before that they talked for months (continuing after the elections). Papandreou kept denying that. Thinking back, it's easy to understand why Papaconstantinou, then Finance Minister, did not act decisively. They've already made their decisions. You can't do one thing while preparing for another.

&gt; That's exactly what's happening. [...] What you seem to be proposing is the European public should have just payed off the share of Greek debt that went above 100% GDP. [...] What you appear to suggest is that, at this point, we should have just torn up the bonds and all would have been fine. Did I get this right? [...] Remember, Greece still has an enormous deficit, even in this scenario. A year later, we're back at 110% GDP.

Again, no, I'm not advocating it, I'm just pointing out that it would be cheaper to do it. Of course, it would be politically difficult. Personally, I lean towards a more Keynesian approach, while [Germans are still allergic](http://blogs.channel4.com/faisal-islam-on-economics/the-1tr-mark-note-symbol-of-germanys-fears/15536) to it. Another solution could be constructed from elements of several alternative proposals, [presented recently in Berlin](http://ineteconomics.org/conference/berlin). Of course, within the Eurozone.

&gt; the other GIIPS

A bit off-topic, but I'd like to point out that some terms are offensive (PIIGS for pigs, GIIPS for gypsy; not that there is anything wrong with pigs and Roma, but still). :)

&gt; 100% of GDP may be an important psychological line, but interest rates don't work this way.

I completely disagree with that. The markets are 10% actual data and 90% psychology. 100% or 110% would be great. The goal now is to lower the debt to GDP ratio down to about 120% in a decade. Then, as EU says, Greece could borrow from the markets AND service older debt, because, as EU says, again, Greece COULD have and sustain very high growth rates. Reality check: this is something that even Germany couldn't do.

&gt; How are the odds the Greek political elite would get to work on the problems that Greece actually has, and that the public would support them, if Europe essentially told them that all new debt would be covered?

I don't consider Greeks, or any other nation, genetically inferior, unable to realise what would be the right thing, if someone explained to them a difficult situation from the beginning. This didn't happen in our case.

&gt; It would take a weekend.

Absolutely not. Changing currency is a big deal, it has many elements.

While abstention was high (~34%), it's caused more by rising transportation costs than unwillingness to vote (due to familial ties, Greeks moving to the cities are encouraged to *not* move their voting districts to where they live, long story) - if you need to move from Athens to the periphery to vote you can easily spend 150 euros in gas and tolls.

&gt; How are the odds the Greek political elite would get to work on the problems that Greece actually has, and that the public would support them

Clearly, you support that the odds are against that, because that's what you think about the average Greek. I'll just say that I'm not a psychic.

Other Germans [agree](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/tlt5f/dear_germans_its_time_for_a_reality_check/c4nw50b) with me on the lamenting part. There are many polls (I left [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/tlt5f/dear_germans_its_time_for_a_reality_check/c4nuluv) recent example yesterday) showing a majority suggesting that only the German position is the way forward, and anyone that doesn't like it should get out. Those responding did not think for a moment that there is a possibility that the German position is wholly or partly faulty. Their sentiments reflect their views (paying for others, paying too much, others are useless), and many of them are victims of propaganda (Greeks drive Porsches, Greeks work less, Greeks retire early, Greeks have lucrative salaries, and so on). You are more than capable of finding such poisonous material everywhere, in mainstream media and all over the internet. It's useless to pretend that it doesn't exist, or trying to divert attention by drawing parallels with stupid anti-German rants of some Greek media. In any case, I don't want to spare another second even thinking about any of them. I prefer reading about [the way forward](http://www.spd.de/aktuelles/News/72312/20120515_troika_pk_wachtumspakt.html).

There is also a level of respect needed for the police in order for them to do their job, the ability to penalize this appalling behavior is a good thing. It has nothing to do with being upset, it has everything to do with respect for the law, which the police officer embodies.

Whether you like it or not, the police is also there to say something when you throw away tin cans. Drinking alcohol in public is forbidden. Littering is forbidden. Insulting the police is an offence. The police should say something about this when they are on patrol in the streets, to look out for people hurting other people. 

I would find it disturbing if they didn't. If kids are on a street corner making a mess and annoying people with insults and threats, you also want the police to fix that for you. Focus their energy on that. Or when your neighbors are having a fight, you want them to fix that also.

All information I'll give you is about Germany, but for Austria the regulations are usually quite similar, since they are also in the EU.

Anyways, of course you can in theory get a master's degree in International law in Germany (and probably Austria,too - google is your friend), for example [at these schools](http://www.llm-guide.com/germany). 

What other fields might be interesting to you depends entirely on your personal talents, skills, interests etc. that I know nothing about.

I'm afraid you can't ""just come and make money"" - you need a residence permit (Aufenthaltserlaubnis) and a work permit (Arbeitserlaubnis), which are not easy to get.

Yes, most schools start classes the Winter semester.

I don't see how you would acquire a [German citzenship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_nationality_law) unless you marry a German. Don't give up the one citizenship you have (how's that even possible?) - that would be just silly.

Some of the schools i linked above have classes in English, some don't. In case you plan to take German classes, it would be very important to check whether your language skills are truly sufficient. 

I would suggest you take part in some sort of organized student exchange/study-abroad-thingy if you're serious about living here - it's the most realistic and least stressful way of getting all the permits and into a university.

Viel Glück :)

Well, a lot of professions are held in very low regard, yet manage to do their job just fine. I've not met many ppl who actually do have any 'respect' for the police. The difference is simply that they will abuse you (illegally or legally) if you're frank about it. A street sweeper for eg. probably won't, or you'll have cause to report him/her. Yet the latter are much more consistently usefull - the police seem to only get involved after the fact, and merely write documentation... Unless its some silly 'crime' like being in a caffee w/o a status of a club after midnight on a weekend, smoking pot, driving a bicycle in a pedestrian zone hourly invaded by unpenalized cars etc. Or are merely the leeches that pester you in late hours whether you have ID with you, so that you can be charged a fine if you've happen to forget it that particular evening..

Honestly, I can see a very cheap way of making the streets and city life more pleasant for everyone - which is to simply fire all policeman that are to patrol the streets.

&gt;it has everything to do with respect for the law, which the police officer embodies.

a law is a set of ideas, or even algorithms, and the police are the subjects of the law, as employees of the state. In no sense whatsoever do they 'emboy law', even if such a concept would be capable of meaning anything.

They are also extremely dangerous employees of the state, given that they are authorised to use force in some circumstances. For this reason, it is essential for them to be under strict control of the public. Something not at all trivial if expressing anger, possibly justified, at their possible abuses is in itself illegal.

&gt;Insulting the police is an offence. 

I don't understand why the police could possibly need this kind of protection (even if that didn't have abovementioned negative side-effects).

Right after the shooting of the poor jewish kids in a school in France, Guardian published one editorial and one opinion piece blaming the shooting on the right wingers, including Sarkozy.

And now they are blaming the bloody crisis on Merkel? Does Guardian have any idea how much political damage Merkel has taken in Germany by pouring in German money into Euro rescue funds? Germans have to come to associate the very outcome of this crisis with her.

&gt; Early in the crisis, the best course of action – the one I believe most likely to have preserved the core of the eurozone – would have been to admit the mistake of admitting Greece into the euro. From that recognition, Greece should have been eased out of the euro, while the German and French banks that were on the hook for losses could have been recapitalized. Finally, a massive firewall of monetary and fiscal support for Spain would have been announced.

Are you kidding me? Germans are already getting called nazis for merely demanding balanced budgets; you think Merkel kicking Greece out of EU will endear Germany to rest of Europe? What kind of logic is this? No matter what germans do, there commitment to EU gets called into question. But EU is as much a responsibility of others as Germany. If Merkel withdrew into a cocoon and refused to help Greece initially, then she would have been called an uber-nationalist. If she provides funds and demands better budget balancing, then she get called neo-liberal/neo-con.

&gt; Now that the elections in Greece, France and the Netherlands have smashed any illusion that all of the adjustment necessary to make the eurozone work can be foisted on other countries, will Germany step up to the plate? Will it advocate for a higher inflation rate, for a common fund for bank recapitalization, and a policy of direct government bond-purchases by the ECB? In other words, will it finally be truthful with its voters about what must be done in order to save the euro?

Trust me, if you convince your average German that they have to turn over keys of their economy to EU so as to save Euro, then they will pack up and leave. Your average German is as selfish as anybody else.

Sorry if this was harsh. But people don't realist that average citizen cares more about their own monies than the austerity of others. And this applies to all countries, whether Greece, Norway, Germany or France. And there is no politician with enough balls to convince the voters to look other way while EU economy is centralized.

true,charlofsweden,SWED,Stockholm,"&gt; The sentence should be just and fair, proportional to the crime he did commit, but that does not mean that the judge should shake hands with him, or he should be let to boast about his theories. Or that he should do a raised hand salute. There are subtle differences in treating someone in a humane way, but still restraining him.

Breivik has the same rights to be heard as anyone else. If he choses to use that opportunity to spout a bunch of insane crap then that's his choice. I'll agree that shaking hands with the judge is a bit much, though. Judges should not shake hands with anyone involved in a criminal case (or they should shake hands with everyone; the important thing is that they are impartial.)

&gt; As it stands now, Breivik is quite happy with his situation and with the possible outcome of the trial. He does not regret killing those people, seems like he achieved his goal. A happy mass murderer. Way to go Norway. What's the point of punishing him then, and what will hold back the next Breivik from doing the same?

The point isn't to punish him. The point is to rehabilitate him so that he does not do it again, so that he becomes a regular, well-adjusted citizen. Obviously for people like Breivik that's impossible, but then that's because they are insane and they need to be locked up and cared for by professionals. Being cruel to him doesn't solve anything, and if you think you can scare other extremists off by making an example of one individual then you are the one who's deluded.

&gt; I'm waiting for the sentence, but i'm also expecting that the victims relatives will be demonstrating. You can ""play nice"" with Breivik for the sake of civilizedness and principles, but what he did has already destroyed that aura. Some countries do have organized far right movements, but still would not find anyone willing to do what Breivik did. So in the end, you are just deluding yourself with that attitude.

Well, that's your way of looking at it, and I think you are wrong. First about there being any sort of demonstrations, unless the court decides on a ridiculously mild sentence (which they aren't: he's going to get life in prison, or life in a criminal psychiatric institution.) I get the vibe that you are looking for a death sentence here, yes? Well, Norway, like most of the rest of civilised world, doesn't execute people. It's illegal, and quite likely against the Norwegian constitution (not sure about this, though) to deliver a death sentence. It's not going to happen.

Secondly about my ""attitude"". I'm not deluding myself here, because I do realise that the humane system used by the Nordic countries in all things criminal and justice related is not perfect or without its faults (but I'll add that they do seem to be working a lot better than what many other countries are doing if you look to violent crimes levels overall.) But there are principles involved that are more important than petty vengence or practicality. Those principles are built on ideals of humane and yes sometimes even kind treatment of the criminally convicted or indeed everyone on the idea that they too are people and that they despite their faults still are a part of and have something to offer society, and that ultimately they are no less important than anyone else. You may criticise these principles if you'd like, but breaking them would be tantamount to going against everything that the society in question is built upon, and that's simply not worth doing for someone as pitiful as Breivik (plus it's exactly those principles that he so despised in the first place that it drove him to his actions. Giving in and abandoning those principles is exactly what he wants Norway to do.)

Plus, like I said: theoretically speaking Breivik is still innocent and should be treated as such.",0,1337105101,null,0,false,0,c4od1cm,t3_to3zo,t1_c4od1cm,t1_c4oaht4,null,1428930570,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Ich habe auch schon Methylphenidat genommen, obwohl ich keine Konzentrationsschwäche habe und habe andere Erfahrungen gemacht:

Ich habe mir zu keiner Zeit gedanken gemacht, ob ich die Leistung die ich unter Einfluss von Methylphenidat bringe nicht auch ohne bringen könnte, da ich wusste das nicht meine Inteligenz gesteigert würde, sondern ledliglich die Fähigkeit sich zu konzentrieren.
Die von dir beschriebenen Nebenwirkungen sind bei mir garnicht aufgetreten, ich habe mich allerdings abends sehr schlapp gefühlt und habe wirklich gespürt wie die Wirkung des Medikaments nachlässt. Leichte Kopfschmerzen hatte ich dann auch - die hab ich aber nach einem anstrengenden Tag öfter.

Dies könnte daran liegen, dass ich wahrscheinlich eine andere Dosierung hatte als du. Ich hatte nur 5 mg ohne retardierende Wirkung. Da du eine nachlassende Wirkung nicht beschreibst gehe ich davon aus dass du eine größere Menge mit retardierender Wirkung genommen hast.

Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass diese ""Droge"" für Menschen, die Probleme haben sich zu konzentrieren sehr hilfreich ist, da sie sich somit genauso gut konzentrieren können, wie Menschen ohne Konzentrationsschwäche.

Allerdings würde ich davon abraten Methylphenidat zur Leistungssteigerung zu benutzen, da die Nebenwirkungen dafür ein zu großes Risiko bieten.

Instead, during times when the economy is doing well everyone is grabbing as much money as possible to spend on shit no one needs but which might get you elected. Then when the economy takes a downturn, spending cuts are made which hurt the economy even more but sound good in news reports.

true,PointAndClick,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt;Honestly, I can see a very cheap way of making the streets and city life more pleasant for everyone - which is to simply fire all policeman that are to patrol the streets.

I'm sorry that you can't do whatever you want and that there are laws to abide by to keep things pleasant for everybody. Police can only 'pester' you if you actually break the law. Who else is going to uphold it, well you certainly won't. Besides this isn't America, police here is reasonable and friendly, they hardly ever carry weapons around. 

&gt;They are also extremely dangerous employees of the state, given that they are authorised to use force in some circumstances.

This is a straw-man argument. We are talking about penalizing offensive behavior, not about the use of excessive force. It's hardly an issue in this country. 

&gt;I don't understand why the police could possibly need this kind of protection.

How does this protect them? It doesn't. So I don't see what point you are making here. This is not about protection. It is about respect for the law. And if you don't agree with them embodying the law, then I'll change that to the people who are upholding the law. We need someone taking up this role of police, otherwise we can't have a functioning democracy. It's majority rule, and not a 'do whatever you want' rule. True freedom is found in the jungle, in a society there are laws to respect.

Its hot as hell here so you wont need jackets and stuff like that. 

Madrid is cool, theres tons of things to do. theres ATM´s on every corner with Visa followed by mastercard as the most common cards, not sure about capital one. 

You can move around easy by metro, 10 travel tickets are 12 euros or 17,40 euros for the 3 day all you can get tourist pass  (doubles to 33 euros if you want access to the periferal parts of the network), take in to account its intrasfarable so you´re going to need to get either 1 each or get 10 travel tickets and share then. 

The 27 bus from atocha to plaza castilla basicly passes near all the important museums like el prado, reina sofia or tissen, it also passes through some of the famous plazas like colon or cibeles so if you get the all you can get tourist pass i do suggest you abuse it a bit, and since its a regular city bus you can use the tourist travel pass to get off and on (it does have a 15 min cooling time)

You should spend some time goind around the retiro, the palacio de cristal is nice and there are some art expositions there, and theres the only (that i know of) official monument to the devil, el monumento al angel caido. 

Theres also a nice route you should take i usualy do, start at tribunal, walk to alonso martinez from there get to chueca by barquillo, in the plaza de chueca theres one of the best ice cream places in madrid, next to it is the san anton market. from there you walk up to fuencarral street which is a nice shopping street, from there you walk to gran via,

you can either go down gran via till callao or go in to montera which is a street famous for prostitution.  from there to sol which is the main plaza, from there go up to plaza mayor, the san miguel food market and then you can go to the opera house and palacio de oriente, from there you get in the smaller streets and get to la latina, 

Thats more or less a cool walk around the city center. 

Madrid is pretty safe but there are some pickpockets, especialy in the city center, its recomended you go around with a little bit of cash, ID and card, 

It might sound racist but most small street crime is commited by rumanian gypsies, i would recomend keeping your bags close by and under observation in the city center, especial the camara bag, a russian friend of mine actually got in to a fight with a gypsy becuase she actually caught her with her hand inside her bag and the woman insted of running actually tried to fight her for the wallet insted of fleeing. 

If you need a cellphone, any unlocked GSM cellphone will do, you can get a prepay kit from Simyo, Yoigo or pepephone for 20-30 euros but you will need to provide your passport or ID, they require all prepay cards be registered since the march 11 bombings back in 2003, and they can usualy be recharged from ATM´s, supermarkets and for some carriers even online, pepephone can even be recharged in alcon viajes and viajes ecuador travel agencies.

5. The Cathedral. The Puente Romano has a very good view of it. Though if you could find a spot on a hill somewhere above the cathedral with a good view looking out on it and the city I would very much like to see that photo (and others!). 

As far as other places to take pictures, just walk around. In between the Cathedral and the river everything has a real medieval vibe to it. But the entire city is worth exploring.

I would agree, if it wasn't for the fact that you are talking about that law. In effect for the ability for everyone to just swear at cops without any consequence.

We don't let the sun dictate our moralities. And nothing is actually stopping you, just like nothing is stopping you from driving 150km/h on the freeway.
Society did in fact decreed that it must not be done, same society that you live in. You get fined or jailed when you get caught breaking societies laws. You get fined for insulting the only people who we have given the power to enforce that law.

I'm sorry dude, but I still haven't read a good reason why this insult law should be abolished. You don't swear at the police when they help you, you swear at them because you broke the law and you got caught doing it. It was something small and you didn't think of it as important, it probably wasn't. But that's simply the way it works, we can't have a functioning society if everybody does 'something small'. Because what is small *is* arbitrary. 

We all know where the line is and what the consequences are when you cross it. Then start insulting the officer who fined you for it because you get caught...
