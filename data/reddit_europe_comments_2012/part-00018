true,badstaples,FRAN,France,"Current French president, N. Sarkozy, is openly against gay marriage, saying that allowing it would lead to adoption. So basically, that means he doesn't think gay people can offer a family life as good as straight people...

The opposition, the socialist party, is in favor. François Hollande, the main competitor of Sarkozy for the 2012 presidential said that, if he is elected, he wants a text allowing it to be adopted right away. Also, I know that the prime secretary of the socialist party, Martine Aubry, wants gay marriage, adoption and assisted reproductive technology for same sex couple to be legalized. But i'm not sure what is the position of Holland on these topics.

Otherwise, I usually meet two types of people : those who don't really care, they don't really think much of gay people and don't see anything wrong in allowing gay marriage, and those who are a bit disgusted by gays, they don't really want to say it but they are not confortable with the idea of same sex couples, so they are not much in favor of gay marriage. Adoption is a little bit trickier, as it seems people lack of information regarding how it could affect a child or not.

&gt; The government schools have higher budgets and are well equipped, with gymnasiums which are often lacking in local government schools.

I have to say that in 2009, when that article was written, schools near me were mostly using soviet era legacy for sports facilities.

&gt; The so-called „pupil’s basket” for Polish schools, as compared with Lithuanian schools, is higher by only 20%, while the actual expenditures per pupil for the operation of minority schools are 40% higher in rural areas and 30% higher in towns (higher costs of implementing the curriculum) than in Lithuanian schools. 

This might be a legitimate concern. Although when I was in school we didn't have anything besides the most basic supplies such as books (except English, you have to buy those yourself), chalk, couple of maps for geography class and decades old stuff for chemistry and physics classes. Later ""smartboards"" in some classes were bought with money from EU aid.

&gt; During the recent reorganization of the school network, six Polish schools were closed in the Trakai Region and one of two Polish schools in the Sirvintos Region – moves that were explained by falling numbers of pupils.

If I remember correctly, there was a plan to consolidate some schools to save some money. I think it was more of a plan to cut some expenses in a face of economic crisis than to discriminate someone.

&gt; the requirement that school internal memos, meetings and even the minutes of pupils’ self-government meetings  be conducted in  Lithuanian  in Polish-language schools.

I think the law was targeting state institutions. There is a need audit and keep track on how they are spending money and it is better if the documents are written in national language.

&gt; [...] the introduction in 2012 of the same Lithuanian language secondary school leaving exam for Lithuanian and national minority schools.

It is a bit concerning, but there are no grammar tests and there is an transitional period set during which students of minorities are treated differently. IMHO the date should be pushed further and evaluation criteria should be negotiated, but it is always good to know the national  language of country you are living well.

true,kalligator,GREE,Greece,"Apart from reparations, a loan of 476 million reichsmarks was forcibly taken from the National Bank of Greece on 14/3/1942 of which the largest part remains unpaid. A total of 19 instalments were paid back from August 1943 to September 1944 and that was it. The net overdue balance amounts to about $100 billion in today's money.

A similar loan was forced upon Yugoslavia and Poland and was repaid to them by 1956 and 1971 respectively. 

I agree with you that claiming responsibility dissonance over politicians' actions is stupid. 
And I quote a redditor's comment from [/r/greece](/r/greece) I couldn't agree more with: 
&gt;A lot of us have been going with the flow, indirectly supporting this mentality of corruption and voting in the same assholes again and again either out of naivety, short-sightedness or personal gain.
We're not saints, we're not demons and we're not the stereotype that's being pushed internationally.

However I still see a double standard in your argument. 
Is it OK to refuse debt responsibility if it's a result of actions taken by your predecessors' regime three generations ago, which mind you, was supported by the majority of people at the time, but not OK if it's a result of exponential growth of accumulated illegitimate debts starting two centuries ago? Because this is the basis of Greece's debt. Largely illegitimate historic loans dumbed on us for which we kept borrowing anew to keep paying them.

For example when we freed our lands from the Ottomans we were loaded with debt **they** had taken from England and Denmark.
Or that loan taken in the fall of 1897 for which the largest part had been repaid under the supervision of Commission Internationale Financière (IMF of the time). In 1964 the finance minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis of the senior Georgios Papanderou government recognised the debt in full and also agreed on a 70% bonus on top of that.

All I'm saying is you can't have your cake and eat it too.

If Germany had always accepted its debts, as Greece has (wrongfully) done throughout the nations history, it could rightfully be in the position of the moral preacher it has assumed today. But this is not the case.

In France, both right-wing and left wing agree on the social security net. No one on the political spectrum aims to reduce it, and in fact Sarkozy's ""High Commissionner for Active Solidarity against Poverty"" expanded it, in order to give the working poor a more comfortable income.

However, while this issue is not in contention between the left wing and the right wing, on many other issues, Sarkozy is very much right wing

* He wants to limit immigration, both legal and illegal
* He will not legalize gay marriage
* He wants to raise the retirement age
* He wants to lower taxes on businesses
* He wants to lower taxes on the very rich (more than 1 million euros in assets)

On every single one of these issue, his position is the ""right wing"" position and goes against the left wing's agenda.

true,chemmkl,null,null,"If you are not fluent with Spanish, then [Costa del Sol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_del_Sol) is where you need to go. We have some 100,000 British ex-pats living here whole year round. That means that pretty much all municipalities have a specific department to help foreign residents, same goes for banks, doctors, supermarkets. Plus we have the higher number of sunny days in Spain (over 300 days per year). The British expats even have their own *ghettos* with supermarkets and bars where only English is spoken (yes, it's in Spain but some waiters can't speak Spanish).

The list of municipalities with beaches in the Costa del Sol: Torremolinos, Benalmádena, Fuengirola, Mijas, Marbella and Estepona. Marbella is pricier and Estepona is too far from the airport and has more rain and wind. Benalmádena and Mijas are small villages some 10km uphill from the sea. but their municipalities are pretty big and now they have towns (bigger than the original villages) right by the beach.

This means you need to be looking for the following places: Benalmádena-Costa *aka Arroyo de la Miel* and Mijas-Costa aka *Las Lagunas* aka *La Cala de Mijas*. The original villages are sometimes referred as ""Mijas-Pueblo"" and ""Benalmádena-Pueblo"". Torremolinos is the cheapest place but Fuengirola would be a safer bet, since the whole municipality extends in a 2km wide coastal band, so it's almost impossible to get an apartment more than a 30 min walk from the nearest beach.

You should to go to [www.enalquiler.com](http://www.enalquiler.com/) and check the above mentioned locations. You should be able to find furnished studios (just 1 room for kitchen/living/bedroom, separate bathroom) around 300€ (usually with communal swimming pool). 

You will be asked to 1 or 2 months deposit (*fianza* in Spanish), and an additional month as commission for the agency (this could be half month or nothing, depending on the specific agency and landlord agreement).

There is always the possibility of sharing a flat, in that case I'd recommend you to try [Friday Ad](http://www.friday-ad.es/). It's a weekly classifieds newspaper very popular in the coast among the expats. Some of them are retirees on a budget (widows, etc) that are willing to sublet a room if they find you friendly enough. The advantage using Friday Ad is that everyone advertising / replying there will speak English.

Also, keep in mind that Spain is the 2nd most mountainous country in Europe right after Switzerland, so there are usually mountains by the sea and just being 3km from the beach could mean a 40min walk uphill when coming back home. Front line beach studios are always pricier and are not usually available for long term rentals (they rent them by the week, up to €1,000 during summer months), but you can get a good deal during winter months.

If you are on a budget ideally you should have a cheap supermarket nearby. The cheapest here are the German chains [LIDL](http://www.lidl.es/) and [ALDI](http://www.aldi.es/), there are several along the Costa del Sol so it might be something to consider when choosing a place.

Also, if you live in Torremolinos, Benalmádena-Costa or Fuengirola, you  can commute to and from the airport and Malaga City (population ~800,000). From Fuengirola onwards there is no train and you need to take the bus.

As for the airfare, I think there are seasonal direct flights from NYC to Malaga with Delta. Malaga is also a big base for Ryanair, the cheapest European airline, so it might be interesting to just take the cheapest ticket from the US into Europe and from there take a flight to Malaga (we had over 12 million passengers in 2011 and we are connected to pretty much everywhere in Europe because of the massive tourism). Ryanair usually operates from secondary airports in smaller towns, but they always offer a bus connection to the nearest big city. For example you might flight to Frankfurt and from there take a Ryanair-partner bus to Hahn a small town in the middle of nowhere with a military air base where Ryanair flights to Malaga (for something like 60€ or even less sometimes).

Hope this helps you. If you consider some location in Costa del Sol feel free to ask for advice on that particular area. For example Golf Rio Real is an somehow expensive area and rentals there should be over 600€ per month, plus it's an urbanisation, meaning it is not within the limits of a town or village: no or very few supermarkets / usually expensive ones, bad public transport usually with long to/from walks involved, no nearby amenities, etc.",0,1329476560,null,0,false,0,c3s5qf4,t3_psvlj,t1_c3s5qf4,t3_psvlj,null,1428370026,5,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,5

I don’t know where you live but the article in the link clearly talks about the Vilnius region as the only region of Lithuania where new well equipped government schools, some with swimming pools,  are created for political reasons  

The regions of Vilnius and Salcininkai, both with a high  percentage of Polish population, are the only regions in Lithuania where the authorities are establishing government schools, with instruction in the Lithuanian language,  financed out of the state budget, alongside local self-government schools (the Vilnius Region has 17 government schools, the Salcininkai Region has 5). Decisions relating to their establishment, size and profile are taken without consultations with the local self-government bodies or the local population. The government schools have higher budgets and are well equipped, with gymnasiums which are often lacking in local government schools. The policy of the authorities is not aimed at strengthening already existent Polish local self-government schools, but, in fact, has the goal of discouraging parents from sending their children to attend them. This leads to absurd situations, with well-equipped schools being established for small groups of Lithuanian children, while Polish schools next door struggle with financial problems.

&gt; If I remember correctly, there was a plan to consolidate some schools to save some money. I think it was more of a plan to cut some expenses in a face of economic crisis than to discriminate someone.

Sure, that sounds very convincing, save money by consolidating schools in the area with large Polish communities.  Even if saving money was a true intent, in a democratic European country  you don’t go about it by closing minority schools, period.  

 the requirement that school internal memos, meetings and even the minutes of pupils’ self-government meetings be conducted in Lithuanian in Polish-language schools.
&gt; I think the law was targeting state institutions. There is a need audit and keep track on how they are spending money and it is better if the documents are written in national language.

It’s specially the case with the minutes of pupils’ self-government meetings, those are  truly crucial in keeping track on how the institutions are spending the government’s money...

I lived in Valencia in 2002 and loved it. If you are relatively young (mid twenties) and don't speak spanish, then you could potentially make friends in the Erasmus community. Valencia isn't a city centered around the beach though. It's more like the city expanded to incorporate the beach. The beach itself is nice and wide, but there's not a whole lot going on there last time I was in Vlc. 

Valencia is a town of around 800,000. Its an awesome size in that you can walk clear across town in about 45 mins. But there is a lot of stuff going on. 

A note about Spain in general. If I were you I'd definitely try to enroll in some kind of language class. You'd be making the most of your stay and you'll also meet people that way. I never tried it but not speaking Spanish in spain must be difficult outside the touristy areas. 

If you're going to be in a small town it's definitely going to help. Living off 2000 (guessing 1000 for airfare) bucks in spain for two months ought to be do-able. Especially in the south. ",0,1329487841,null,0,false,0,c3s6lor,t3_psvlj,t1_c3s6lor,t3_psvlj,null,1428370448,1,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,1

I don't know what gave you this idea, here's what actually being happening.

For the 2000-2009 decade, Greece borrowed **€466**bn in total.

Here comes the funny part. The aggregate deficit, i.e. the sum of each year's deficit for that period was **€16.8**bn.

The amount that went into paying back older loans interest and repayments was **€430**bn!

Another ~ €20bn is missing from the picture and one can only imagine where it went (hint: corrupt politicians).

So in essence we are talking about a debt that is composed of **92+% for older loans payments** and only 3.6% of deficit.

So our insufficient-unproductive-corrupt-overspending economy would be in a position to manage things with only a couple of billions deficit have we not had the burden of mostly illegitimate historical debts on our backs. Pretty manageable I should say.

Throughout history we have been the suckers that always accepted debts claimed on us irrespective of their legitimacy, and this is where it got us today. 
Whilst Germany who did not repay their debt (along the reparations) is standing there preaching about financial responsibility and pointing fingers.

You say you do not like it when Greece calls out on this injustice, and I ask you for the third time, can we agree on which debts should be considered erasable? 

We'd be happy to give up our claims if the said rule were to be applied to all parties.
Except if the rule is ""Whatever Germany feels like erasing""...

And this whole ""bailout"" operation had nothing to do with saving Greece. The agreement clearly specifies that any money that comes from it goes EXCLUSIVELY to the debt repayment. Not a single cent has gone/will go into paying salaries, pensions or any other budgetary needs. 
It's only purpose was to unload the risk from the private bond holders to European taxpayers and shift the legal context of the issued bonds away from Greek law.

Yes and no. The president is a special case, that it's difficult to get rid of him is by design. Most of his power is ceremonial -- a bad president can't do much damage, but a good one can prevent some in a ""constitutional emergency"" situation. To remove him from office, you need the support of the parliament, *and* the highest court has to confirm that he actually broke a law. You can't just fire him because he's an ass, or, more to the point, because he's getting in the way of the current government.

Getting rid of the chancellor is easier. The parliament can simply elect a new one, for no particular reason at all.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"Well, Greece has always been the closest ally of Cyprus, and they also speak the same language.

While the amounts look very scary, Cyprus handles a lot of money from other countries to due to lower corporate taxes -- so while all of this can be a major hit to the banking system -- many people will not actually let it fall (if you check the article out and look at the amount of assets the banks have, it's even more :P)

Cyprus has already approved a lot of austerity measures and they have started agreeing on various measures to boost employment. The politicians here just like in most other countries are very incompetent and slow, but since there are a lot of intelligent people involved behind the scene, they almost always end up going in the right direction even if they drag their feet for a while.

There are already signs that Cyprus is moving its focus away from Greece as far as business/economical matters are concerned, with new partnerships being forged with other countries such as Israel (on defence, oil/gas etc).

Currently they are talking about building several multi billion dollar projects such as a liquefaction plant for natural gas, underwater electric lines to link Israel &lt;-&gt; Cyprus &lt;-&gt; Crete, Greece &lt;-&gt; Mainland Europe.... even the US Government is opening up an energy headquarters for the region here.

Overall it seems the economy here is avoiding and will avoid most of the problems, and money is gonna continue flowing because the long-term prospects on the various projects going on are very good -- so I guess overall other than the rating agency downgrades etc, they aren't really focusing on all this other stuff simply because it just doesn't really matter.

It seems to be all about business in the end.. The cypriot people will continue to give their support for the greek people, but the business people are moving onto other stuff.

Cyprus overall is a very weird country, because while many people will easily associate it with Greece -- other than some cultural aspects and the language -- it's much more similar to the UK (Cypriot law is based upon and mostly compatible with UK law).. they are just a little bit less eurosceptic as they actually understand that overall they are not really a powerful country.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; This is unfair to the millions of Greeks who pay their taxes, work hard and believe that Greece has to change.

Absolutely, it is. And I can see how what's happening must seem like humiliation and diktat from a Greek perspective. What *should* be done would be to give them the time they need to sort out their problems and the money they need to invest and build a better economy. From the perspective of Europe as a whole, and from the individual member states, it's a different matter, though. Let's go through those two, separately:

That political constraints in individual member states carry so much weight, and that we even are in this situation, is due to the original design flaw of the Eurozone, which itself was caused by similar political constraints.  
Like everything EU, it couldn't be created by a clean-slate, top down approach, but had to be built from the ground up, by finding a consensus between a large number of individual governments that each have to answer to their own electorate and ultimately had its own national interest in mind. For the EU to have any say at all, which could still be subject to a veto by even the smallest individual member state, the individual nation states must first transfer the respective competences to the EU. This means giving up sovereignty, and in the case of budgets, this is an especially unpopular thing to do. So they just didn't, and pretended that they could simply fix this issue later, as if difficult tasks you had failed to accomplish to get your reward would get any easier if you hand out what should have been the motivation before calling them in.

This leaves us with a situation where national governments are subject to domestic political constraints. For Germany et al., this is mainly the risk of permanent transfers (or permanently higher interest rates, which is perceived as being essentially the same thing), and the very real threat of populist anti-EU movement, as we can already observe to a certain degree. (In Germany, the well-polling opposition is actually much more open to this, and explicitly supports Eurobonds, but the troubled government coalition would almost certainly break up, but let's not get down to this level of detail.)

From a general EU/Eurozone perspective, there are different constraints. This crisis, not quite incidentally, is coming right after the previous one. Ireland and Spain would have been fine without it, and Portugal would have managed as well. Now we have another one, and we've seen not only in Italy what the mere possibility that it might escalate can do. The top priority has to be to prevent escalation, followed by maintaining the ability to limit its effects if this fails. This requires more financial and political capital than what is left after countering the effects of the previous crisis.  
This lack of capital is aggravated by the problems in other countries. Cut Greece too good of a deal, and Portugal could rightfully expect the same, something the Eurozone is simply unable to afford without risking a chain reaction at a time where markets are exceptionally sensitive to large budget deficits. The opposite is true as well -- Greece is in the unfortunate position to serve as an example.

The alternative would be to up the ante, and hope that giving up the ability to enact meaningful countermeasures in case of an escalation won't lead to just that happening. In such a scenario, Europe would give Greece more time to cut the kind of spending that is indeed unnecessary and to reform its bureaucracy, and the necessary funds for an economic growth policy and to counter the negative effects of austerity.  
Apart from the risk of other countries overstretching their own ability to maintain debt, this would require trust in the Greek political system to make unpopular decisions and to reform itself, something it had not been able to do during the best of times, and which it has a very hard time doing even under the immediate threat of disorderly default. It would be not unlike the Eurozone's ""original sin"" of believing that unpopular but necessary steps would magically become easier after the reward had already been payed out. Considering what is at stake here, this seems like an awfully risky bet.

Instead, Europe seems to have decided that the course of action will be to play it less risky, to ""use"" the window of opportunity that this crisis provides to coerce its individual members to transfer the necessary budgetary sovereignty for a more stable currency union, and similarly to use the leverage over Greece to ""fix"" it (albeit in a rather crude manner). As far as the necessary unpopular decisions go, governments of individual member states can point to the threat of collapse, and the Greek government can point to the Troika. 

After this has been achieved and the immediate threat has been averted, there will be a mechanism that makes meaningful monetary transfers possible by giving the Eurozone as a whole the controls that are necessary to justify them, and hopefully the financial breathing space to come up with the funds that Greece needs.  
That's when things like fairness can become meaningful again, but until then, it will be realpolitik in its purest form.",0,1329502953,null,0,false,0,c3s93zt,t3_ptvca,t1_c3s93zt,t3_ptvca,null,1428371621,75,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,75

If you stick to the touristy parts you will have no problem with the lack of Spanish. You can do most stuff in English.

Broadband isnt a problem in Spain.  However Telefonica might want you to sign up to a 12 months contract. So you'd be better off looking at one of the pay as you go tarifs. Some urbanisations actually have a wifi service you can get.

Assuming you are American, then youre fine for 3 months. If youre european you can stay as long as you like.  Look into health insurance though just in case you get poorly.

There are a tonne of empty apartments on the coast, the recession has hit quiet heavy. Look for ""short term"" rentals. Not long terms. Long terms are 11 months. Youre wanting 1 or 2 months. 

The Costa Del Sol is very safe, but like anywhere just keep your eyes pealed.   Most Englishy places are Fuengirola, Benalmadena, Mijas Costa.   Estepona is a very lovely place and I highly recommend it, its a nice mix of English and Spanish.

You should be able to get a fully fitted apartment for about 500 euros a month with air con, sea views. They will ask for a deposit. But dont fall victim to paying any finders fees or other commision. You pay a deposit, your rent, electric and water. There really isnt anything else you should pay.

If you need any more on the Costa Del Sol, please pm me as I have been living here for 5 years so know it pretty well :)

Very sorry to hear about the domestic abuse. Trust me youre doing a great thing getting out of there, and having a new place to explore and meeting new people will soon take your mind off it.

Looking at [their military forces](http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=Turkey) over the years, it's quite obvious that they are continuously building it up while the rest of Europe is trying to cut down on military spending. Is it wise to ignore this military build up and dick posturing?

Please note that a few years ago, Cyprus was going to buy some S300 anti-air missile systems and Turkey created an outcry in the international community that it would damage ""the balance of power in the region"" (wtf?)


A quick summary of all of the information of why Turkey is acting childish over Cyprus and Israel lately
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quite a lot of natural gas has been found between the southern coast of Cyprus and Israel. According to the internationally recognized borders, Turkey has no say in this. Their political stance is that since the island is divided, it's not fair to the turkish cypriots in the non-recognized northern part of the country which apparently has approximately 300k population (approximately 2/3 of which are illegal immigrants from Turkey and the Turkish army and 1/3 are actual Turkish Cypriots which will hopefully one day soon reunite with the rest of the country). Turkey's actual stance is that the whole island belongs to them if you look into stuff a bit better. The southern part of Cyprus (which is the recognized part and an EU member state) has a population of approximately 840k people.

The whole dispute would make sense if the gas finds were actually off the northern coast for example. So in the big picture, Turkey has no actual right to even put their nose into this.

Since a lot of this gas is also in Israel's territorial waters, Cyprus and Israel are co-operating together to develop this major find. I'm guessing in the background, Turkey tried to get Israel to agree that Cyprus should have no part in this but the Israelis didn't agree to that as they have always had very good relations with Cyprus and they were even one of the first countries to recognize the Republic of Cyprus after the turkish invasion.

We can all generally agree that Israel has been up to some bad stuff over the years, but we should not let this get in the way of this issue for now as it's not related at all even though Turkey's public relations department would love you to consider it all part of the same thing.

As we all know, Israel has quite good intelligence gathering, strategies etc (again, lets not discuss if they use it in a good or bad way). As it currently stands, Cyprus holds all of the pieces on the whole gas thing with all of the major world powers being happy which guarantees that if Turkey actually did try to act on any of their threats, they would actually have major problems.

One of the major problems we have in the EU is that we need many energy-based imports such as natural gas. The Cyprus-Israel gas project will surely export the majority of the surplus gas to the EU based on what is being heard. Again remember, as far as the recognized territories etc, this is all legal -- so it's not something along the lines of ""it's ours because we say so"", but that it's very convinient to uphold what the internationally recognized territories are.

So obviously one of the problems could have been the Americans and I'm guessing this is where Israeli intelligence came into this... Noble Energy (an american company) is one of the main companies behind this project and the american government has actually told noble energy to ignore the turks and continue with what they are doing.

The other thing worth considering is that Cyprus is also the UK's permenant aircraft carrier (a lot of the middle eastern operations are based out of here). The UK has also confirmed that they have no problem with the gas thing and the territories etc.

Russia has shown support for Cyprus by recently giving them a ""no strings attached"" bailout to shield them from the Greek debt crisis for now.. I'm guessing they are somehow going to ""volunteer"" to give them a small slice of the pie too (remember, there are several blocks that still have not been explored but are suspected to also hold a nice amount of gas).

So here we have the details:

Side #1: Turkey dick posturing claiming everything belongs to them

Side #2: EU (receiver of the benefit of having a new source of natural gas within the eurozone), US (contractor), Israel + Cyprus (the ones with the ""goods"" as per the internationally recognized territories), Russia (they want a slice of the pie too and will probably win 1-2 auctions for some of the unallocated blocks).

In the big picture I believe Turkey will just bark for a little while and then be quiet again. The Americans will make sure of that simply because if Turkey tried to actually do something, NATO would pretty much fall apart if they didn't expel Turkey first -- and do you HONESTLY believe the US would back Turkey against Israel if it came to it?

One of the problems that I see in the attitude of Turkey is that they believe that one of the reasons they are important is because they are a ""big military force"".. wasn't the whole point of NATO to make sure that big people aren't bullying the smaller people?

There is also apparently some new treaty changes in the EU recently which make it in a way that the EU would have to defend member states in the event of an attack. No military would actually have to be mobilized to strike Turkey in the event of any actual act of war as most of the EU, the US and Russia already have several naval ships in the eastern mediterranean and the UK has a permenant aircraft carrier called Cyprus. So there are most of the actual facts from this situation -- if Turkey did strike, it would probably be the biggest mistake they ever did simply because of how ""perfect"" the agreements are right now for everyone else involved.

I noticed that when Turkish politicians talk to media in their country they make sure to mention stuff like ""international law"" and stuff which sounds really awesome -- and it seems a lot of their people actually believe this stuff.",0,1329506511,null,0,true,0,c3s9sdj,t3_pu8ol,t1_c3s9sdj,t3_pu8ol,null,1428371971,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

Extremism flourishes in poverty, and it seems that Greeks really are abandoning the centre of politics in search of solutions, which makes perfect sense if you think about it.  Seeing as the mainstream politicians have failed them so completely, and the only solution they are offering is increasing poverty, it's natural that people will look to other ideologies for hope.

Unfortunately for Greece and for Europe, other ideologies don't have a very good track record of keeping peace.   But apparently democracy is failing to keep the peace too.   And according to this article, some German ministers are trying to neuter Greek politics entirely: 

&gt;This week the German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schauble, voiced fears others have only spoken about in private: that given the low showing of the ""mainstream parties"", there should be a truly technocratic government, with no career politicians involved.

This is devastating for the confidence of a nation - the idea that anonymous people, approved by other countries will run their lives in order to keep their will at bay.    

I think the best case scenario is that the Greeks who are suffering in poverty form productive collectives, find communities that can support each other with the minimum of money involved.  Basically small-scale communism, where people are poor but can support each other.  The alternative - a shift to the far right - is far more undesirable and I can't see it benefiting anyone.

Absolutely; it's a rule of the majority, so it represents what **most** of the population thinks. Everywhere, at least where the elections aren't a joke.

&gt; Italians voted in freaking Berlusconi more than once. Do they deserve to be humiliated for that? Well, maybe not every single one of them personally, but they voted for him.

That's pretty much it. The same moronic sub-humans who voted for ""uncle"" Benito voted for uncle Silvio because he was a ""real man"" (argh) and most importantly, they didn't want to carry the burden of being citizens. Either that or the trash in Naples is sent by the Gods above. Btw they voted berlusconi **four** times, should anybody else need ""proof"" (lol).

Germans also had a pretty... controversial figure in charge at the time but look at them: they clearly understood the lesson, they teach it their children and are a model of democracy and efficiency for the planet. Hard to believe Hitler and Mussolini shaked hands, right?

I agree. The same type of reasoning you find in Italy: no matter how democratically elected the government is, it's all their fault and their fault only. This is clearly talk from people who don't act as citizens and only think of politics (""that kinda stuff"") once in a while: doesn't it look childish and uncivilized?

They steal from the government for years without remorse: doesn't it look scum?

Does anything the greeks do look like they're able to run a country? Not only politicians (who, again, are elected **by the people!**) run the country but honest citizens who look after the public thing, pay taxes because it's right and not because they have to, and so on.

Flobin, we agree. And everybody thinks like that. It's that simple, really. It's just that saying the greeks are dumbasses isn't acceptable so they come up with all kinds of excuses and they agree... on the internet, in public. Behind closed doors, it's a totally different story.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"I wouldn't worry too much about the extremist parties in Greece. The ones on the left seem pretty harmless and the ones on the right don't have enough votes. Let's do a breakdown. (names followed by percentage in the latest polls) 

Left: 

* Communist Party of Greece (10%): Remnants of Soviet-led pseudo-communist parties of the Cold War era. They might be dangerous but it's unlikely. So far, they back-pedalled their anti-EU stance when things were getting serious once. Second, their protests are the most peaceful ones: they shout for 2-3 hours then go home. Third, they are known to have protected the government from other protesters. Their Cypriot sister party ruled Cyprus for some time and no one noticed. 

* Coalition of the Radical Left (9.5%): A coalition of small left parties, created as a schism from the Communist Party because didn't like the authoritarian style or something. Currently led by a youngster who is using populist aggressive rhetoric. The party used to be eurosceptics but have since reversed their stance. They are the most likely to play it tough, but probably because of naivete rather than a sincere desire for radical solutions. 

* Democratic Left (11.2%): Led by an old man, used to be part of Coal. Rad. Left. Supposedly left them because they were pro-EU (while the others were eurosceptics at the time). In reality the most likely reason was that they wanted a milder approach that would attract centrist voters. Even though their ideology is on the far left of the spectrum, they rarely say anything contentious. They are the least dangerous of the three and very likely to replace the socialist party as the hub for leftist voters. 

Right: 

* Popular Orthodox Rally (3.1%): Uber-nationalist, religious, pro-business party. They are remnants of royalists and fascists. Dangerous for immigrants, most likely to be very conservative in their foreign policy approach. Lost a lot of voters when they entered the coalition government, which is why they recently pulled out of it. Not a lot of spine.

* Golden Dawn (1.8%): Fascists, racists, nationalists. Really dangerous stuff. They are somewhat of a criminal organisation, regularly attacking immigrants and the like. No idea what they would do if they entered the government. Probably something really bad.

All the percentages are raw poll results, for final numbers you have to control for undecided people and the ones who say they won't vote. Add about 40% to these numbers to get their final scores. Note that you need 3% of the final score to get a single seat in the parliament.

As you can see, the left parties have far more voters and they are not very dangerous for the internal peace of the country. Their foreign policy is an unknown but they are all committed ""bourgeois"" parliamentarians so the chances they'll do something radical are slim (unless of course that rumour that the rest of the EU will push Greece out of the euro is true).",0,1329520589,null,0,true,0,c3scdyk,t3_pu7fi,t1_c3scdyk,t1_c3sa5z6,null,1428374430,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

6804 + 4302 in taxes.

Thats 925 euros a month gone.

That puts you at 3575 a month.
Rent for a family of four with charges (heat, power, water etc) will hit you another 2000 euros a month.

Now you're down to 1575 for a family of four.
~400 euros a head.

Having lived in France for a year, I would advise you from a Financial sense not to take this, if they were offering you at least 4000 more, then it might be worth considering.

I would eat and drink 1000 euros a month on my own, and the quality of life is probably higher in the US than in France (I come from Canada where the quality of life is much higher).

Think about your average run of the mill restaurant, a plat du jour for lunch will set you back 15 eur, dinner 20.

Dinner for two with wine ~ 75 euros.

No German I was ever with outright judged me for being American, I imagine it's the same for Canadians. Just don't be a dick to people, and you'll be treated with respect.

Local Customs, mostly just make sure if you are making Prost with people, you look them dead in the eye when you hit their glass.

Public Drinking is acceptable in Germany, but not always appropriate. Don't wander around drunk all the time. We never got looked at twice for peeing anywhere. Basically like before, don't be an annoying douche to people and you won't be bothering anyone.  Your fun craziness will be more appreciated by younger people in festival settings.

Take as much money as you're comfortable, for a week of drinking and restaurants, I'd be safe with at least 60 Euros per day. Also, dunno how tipping is in Canada, but in Germany it's basically a way to round up to the nearest dollar. More than 5% will get you funny looks. Just hand them your money and tell them the amount you want to pay.

I'd say the one thing we did that instantly earned us some respect was our actual use of the language. Our whole group of students had been learning German for less than a year, but were vaguely adept at speaking, and this floored coworkers, waitresses, and random acquaintances all the time when we told them our less-than-a-year experience but could hold a conversation with them. Since most Germans were much better at English than we were at German, they'd try to resort to that a lot, but they appreciated the hell out of our attempts.

Anyone will be able to tell you're not from around there as soon as you speak, and if you're toting around a camera all the time. Otherwise, you shouldn't stand out too much.

Learn avoir and aller verbs and their conjugations too and you'll be half way there.

A final piece of hilarious advice - yes the 95% rule is true but les faux amis, those words which are common but don't have the same definition can land you in the centre of the joke every time, excitée means excited, but a lot of French connotations are different and this particular word has a sexual connotation.

If you want more info, you can check [here](http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/F1866.xhtml). (It's all in French, so if you need help I can translate, just ask!). In public schools I'm almost sure English is only tought as a second language, but if you really want your kids to learn English, you should look for a private school. I just googled it and found [this](http://www.international-school-ombrosa.com). 

You should try to learn a bit of French before coming, it will make your life easier. Most things are not translated in English. In a city like Lyon you will probably find people who can speak English, but don't expect everybody to understand you, French people are not known for their skills regarding foreign languages! But it's getting better, most student will be able to at least ""communicate"" with you, so you can always ask. And people will always appreciate if you start with ""Excusez-moi, pourriez-vous m'aider ?""

true,fooppeast420,null,null,"&gt;As a Canadian will I be welcome in town?

As long as you don't shove it down everyone's throat, people won't assume anything about you being Canadian. There is no real stereotype for Canadians present in Germany so just don't be a dick.

&gt;Will I be mistaken easily for an American resulting in rudeness or confrontation?

Yeah, that could happen but as long as you play it cool (correcting them) there should be no trouble.

&gt;What are some local customs I should be aware of?

Baden-Württemberg is a mostly conservative-minded state, although the cities aren't that bad. If you take a trip to some tiny german village be prepared to be met with a rather cold welcome, but that's how it is around there. If you get to know the people, they won't let you go. 

&gt;How do I blend in more easily (not wanting to look like a tourist/visitor)?

Normal tourist rules apply: Don't wear a camera (visibly), don't walk around with a backpack between 9-13 and 13-16 and don't look at buildings while pointing at them, ""Uuuing"" and ""aaahhing"" at the same time. Seriously, this freaks people out.

&gt;For a week's stay, how much should I bring for spending money. Accommodations are taken care of, I'm talking about eating out at restaurants and drinking a good amount of German beer (never tried by the way) for about 5-6 days?

Prices for restaurant heavily depend on where you plan to go. Fancy restaurant, you alone, I'd say about 18€+ . Beer comes in a variety of sizes and forms. Cheapest I've seen was 2€ for a crate and the most expensive was 16€ for 6 0,5L bottles.

&gt;What are some things the Karlsruhe ladies like in a man?

Foreigner. Instant bonus.

&gt;I like to be kind of crazy (in a very fun way), how accepting would people be?

As long as it's all fun and games it's cool. But cut some of the Hitler/Nazi jokes. We've heard them all and they don't get any funnier. Seriously. No nazi jokes.

&gt;What am I allowed to do in public while drunk, ie., peeing, stumbling, yelling (at no-one, just in general), high-fiving strangers etc.?

Depends heavily on the time. If you're drunk between 8 and 19, people will think you're a jobless no-good/tourist/asshole. After that it's *normally* ok to be drunk in the streets, just don't hug every stranger you meet. Yelling is ok, but if you're too loud you may be asked to tone down a bit. Generally, nothing is forbidden but (especially older Germans) will look down on you for behaving drunkenly while drunk. And don't try to be a smart-ass with the police. They don't like that sort of thing with foreigners.

&gt;Is there something I can do to instantly win the respect of people I meet there. I'm talking about maybe consuming something, doing something, or saying something?

Oh boy, that is easy.
Try to speak german. People will like it and compliment you, even if it's shitty. Learn to drink beer properly. Open beer bottles in a variety of ways. Pronounce beer in a german way, emphasis on the ""I"" in Bier. Karlsruhe is in Baden. Baden and Swabia have kind of a rivalry so if you (pretend to) dislike Swabia you should get some points with the locals. An inhabitant of Baden is a ""Badner"".

FedEx, UPS, and DHL were more expensive as they only had 2-day Int'l shipping options. The USPS took about a week to deliver and was cheaper by 20%. 

Be careful about import taxes. Germany is big on impounding all packages until an import tax is paid. This basically requires you to know how much each item cost and have a receipt to prove it. I was told that when people move to Germany, the import tax is waived but you'll need to prove that your S.O. just moved. The German customs ended up holding my photo albums, household nicknacks, and computer until I could gather the needed paperwork to prove I had in fact moved to Germany.

Had I opted to pay the import tax, they were prepared to Google each item and tally up a value for the stuff that had no receipts. As a non-Germany, I found it a bit odd that they expected receipts to be kept for everything.

true,acida,null,null,"Born and lived in Karlsruhe all my life:

* You will be just fine. People here are used to foreigners, as a lot of people from all over the world study at the universities. Of course, they are a few assholes in every town, nothing different with Karlsruhe. Most people also speak at least a few words of English.

* Karlsruhe has (had) some nice local breweries, be sure to drink at least a bottle of each ;) Try Rothaus Zaepfle, Hoepfner, Moninger, Wolfbraeu. Then start drinking through the rest of Germany, Jever, etc.

* At the weekends, people in downtown are used to drunk people, during work days you can still stick to the student areas (at the university), e.g. Carambolage club. Still, normal rules apply: Don't bully other people, be nice, be friendly, be happy. If you're peeing in public, police might accost you and if you're dead drunk and maybe a little unpolite they might even take you into custody for the night. Singing, stumbling etc is ok, but as said, don't be a bully and don't break anything.

* If you want to eat on a budget, stick to the student pubs. Kippe, Bleu, Stoevchen and Emaille are all very nice with emaille signs lining the walls and with so called ""Hammeressen"" (5 different meals) each for 3,90, which is as cheap as it can get in Karlsruhe. Emaille also serves breakfast all day long.

* don't know how it's like in Canada, but Germany is one of the few countries, where at pubs etc. everyone pays for themselves. Of course sometimes someone is paying for all of them, but most of the time, people just pay their own drinks, instead of having to split the bill the waitress just talks with every single one, you telling her what you drank, and she telling you what to pay. Round up, so that you give a tip of around 5-10%. In some pubs (e.g. Irish Pubs) you have to pay instantly for every drink, bust most of the time, you just pay all your drinks before you leave.

* For sightseeing, don't miss the Karlsruher Schloss (palace) with it's surrounding park area, as well as the pyramid at the market place. If you want to see some more, you can check out Ettlingen, which is just 15 minutes with the tram from Karlsruhe downtown and a very nice old little town, south from Karlsruhe. If you have more time (and a car), you can go to the Pfalz where you can visit a lot of medieval castles. They also have very good wine. Make sure to eat a Flammkuchen.

* If it's your first time in Germany, besides drinking bear, eat bread! Nothing like german bread. Not the white stuff, but the good darker stuff, e.g. Roggenmischbrot or Vollkornbrot. With Salami or honey or Nutella or marmelade or whatever.

* For bringing home, you should consider wine (from Rheinland Pfalz or Baden), maybe Nutella (if you know someone with a Metro (special whole sale store) pass, go there, they sell 5kg (!!) Nutella glasses), and all the good german sweets stuff, Rocher, Haribo, etc.

So that's all I can think of right now, if you have any questions or need some more hints / tips (pubs/shopping stuff/sightseeing, blabla), just drop me a note :-) Hope you enjoy your stay!!",0,1329575221,null,0,true,0,c3shwx4,t3_pus9n,t1_c3shwx4,t3_pus9n,null,1428377029,6,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,6

This mindset was born out of the Soviet annexation and continues on so strongly, because the vast majority of the local population of Russians are openly against the independence and democracy of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania. They want the Baltics to be part of the Russian federation. Some radicals wish to eliminate the Baltic people altogether.

The majority of the local population of Russians do not wish to integrate to the Baltics. They wish to forcefully Russianize the Baltics. Many haven't even became citizens of the Baltics, because the existence of the Baltic states (and people) is somewhat of an insult to them.

Another source for cheap food is the [cafe oxford](http://www.oxford-studentenfutter.de/). You can get a good cheseburger (much better than mc donalds, but no real nice burger) for 3.90€. Try the ""Karlsruher Naturtrüb"" beer. It is 2 € for a 0,5l mug and tastes really good (especially when you consider the low price). Be warned, it makes bad headaches after 4 mugs an evening.

A nice way to learn about German beer might be the [Bierdiplom](http://www.bierakademie-karlsruhe.de/index.php?contenttype=PG&amp;contentid=2). You can get a nice certificate in the beer academy in Karlsruhe after successfully drinking 12 different beers (&gt;4L!) in one evening. You should call ahead and come in a small group to share the fun. Calculate at least 4 hours of heavy drinking.

true,ginekologs,LATV,Latvia,"OK, I will try but I think that word ""minority"" isn't best that should be used. I just couldn't think of any other. That's probably why some could not understand. Some reminder, Latvia is a new country, so laws can be imperfect and not written/integrated well, especially with some really stupid politicians in 90ties that made wrong decisions with integration laws.

Let's say you are citizen but don't vote nor ever want to and admit that in public and advise others to do the same. There are a lot of people in the world that do that. And yet you don't like what's happening with your country. In democracy best way to get heard is to vote. 

In this situation some non citizens/citizens don't like what is happening. 20 years ago non citizens were ~700k, now under 290k (around 65% of them Russians, so there are other ethnic minorities). Around 400k integrated (mostly because naturalization process was made easier), some left. Some will naturalize in future but there is a big part that will not. I'm not calling anyone old but big part of them are. Sooner or later they will die and number is dropping. Some of them are extreme leftists (communists) that will never admit occupation or independence of Latvia. Yet still lives here and protest about their situation. Latvia can't tell what to think or do, only offer but they already made their mind. So, when there is no dialogue, it's impossible to solve the problem. This small minority controls a big part of Russian minds here because they have help from opposition party and Kremlin. [Guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Linderman) that started this referendum isn't even Latvian citizen. After 5-10 years they will be under 100k or less, how can you give official status for that small minority? 

Of course, there are people that are citizens and want two languages, they will vote ""yes"" today. Some actually want it but some gave in propaganda (as I mentioned above: advise what to do). This referendum will show how many want it.

As I'm writing this, I think them now not as minority but ideological group that happens to overlay this ethnic group. Russian language in Latvia isn't their main goal. Their goal is official status of Russian language in EU (if it gets official status in Latvia, they can get it to EU). 

This group is protesting and that is why from outside Latvians may seem a bit xenophobic. Here this referendum is perceived as attempt to destabilize our democracy. It's not really about language, it never was.

&gt;As a Canadian will I be welcome in town?

Sure, there is a lot of different backgrounds of people in Karlsruhe.  I know a Canadian myself here, She's never had any issues.

&gt;Will I be mistaken easily for an American resulting in rudeness or confrontation?

Depends.  As far as I've seen, Americans don't get a lot of rudeness directed towards them, but if you speak English and it's not proper British english, there's a good chance you will be mistaken for one.  Worst case, you'll be asked how stupid Americans are with the whole health care / religious / George Bush stuff.  Just tell them you're not American.  You might even get a bump in interest in Canada :)

&gt;What are some local customs I should be aware of?
How do I blend in more easily (not wanting to look like a tourist/visitor)?

Walk with a purpose.  You don't have to be storming around the city, but I've yet to see a people just wandering around Karlsruhe.  They seem to be going somewhere.

Waiters won't come around and leave the check like in NA, you'll have to ask for it.  As far as I've seen people leave fairly soon after paying as well.

I know this is a bit more subjective, but loose fitting or baggy clothes seems not to be very common here.  Clothes with a little better fit will help blend in.

&gt;For a week's stay, how much should I bring for spending money. Accommodations are taken care of, I'm talking about eating out at restaurants and drinking a good amount of German beer (never tried by the way) for about 5-6 days?

I'd say probably 50 euro per day depending on what you want to do?  Breakfast can be gotten from Bakeries here (pretty common and delicious and there are bakeries everywhere) for 1-3 euro.  Lunch a little bit more at probably 5 or 6 euro, depending on where you go, Bakeries sometimes have sandwiches and pizzas for a couple euros and the Doener places are yummy as well.  If you're missing the far west flair, there's also a food court in Ettlinger Tor mall ;).  This will leave you around 40 euro or so for dinners and after.  Dinner should run you around 15-20 euro with beer and if you want to go to a club after it will probably run 5-15 euro cover.  Beers here are about the same as in NA 2-4 eu for a half liter in a restaurant or club, but only about .80 at the supermarket!  So 50 euro will get you by no sweat, if you want to do more, you'll need to take more.

&gt;What are some things the Karlsruhe ladies like in a man?

Foreigners :). Seriously though, it's a good ice breaker!

&gt;I like to be kind of crazy (in a very fun way), how accepting would people be?

With people you know, very.  With strangers - people here are in general a bit more conservative and formal with people they don't know.  Either way people aren't going to run away, but it won't go very far to help you blend in ;)

&gt;What am I allowed to do in public while drunk, ie., peeing, stumbling, yelling (at no-one, just in general), high-fiving strangers etc.?

I would skip the peeing in public.  Drinking in public and stumbling around at night are a-ok (I would say when it starts getting dark, that sorta thing is more acceptable).  It's a fairly dense city, so yelling at night probably won't net you that many new friends, but unless you're completely obnoxious or belligerent, I don't think anybody will make an issue of it.  Generally, the same social rules apply as in NA.  Being drunk and fun as fine, but if you take it too far, you might run into problems.

&gt;Is there something I can do to instantly win the respect of people I meet there. I'm talking about maybe consuming something, doing something, or saying something?

Easy.  Try to speak German.  You have no idea how far it will take you just making the effort.  I guess it comes down to that you are in their land so it's respectful to try to use their language :)

I know this is a bit long, but here are a few other things I learned that migt help you blend in a bit:

Euro pronounced similar to ""oy-roh"" here and there is no pluralization (e.g. 30 euro not 30 euros).

When you didn't hear, instead of saying ""was?"" (what?) like we do in English, say ""bitte?""(please?) it's a bit more polite and I think bitte is one of the most useful words you can learn.

There's lots to see around Marktplatz, the schloss is there and the mall and a huge shopping district is nearby and its a central hub for many of the trains.

The Russian language in Latvia is not the point of this referendum — I agree. Russian language in EU is the point of this referendum — I don't. It's whether the opinions of Russians are considered at all or not, and it's about representation in the government. Russians don't want to be always left out, but they don't want to become Latvians. Instead, they want to be Latvian Russians and like normal citizens of this country, have a government which works for all citizens. The vast majority of Russians don't look at Russia as their home country. If people are born here and live all their life here, if they arrive at ANY place in Russia, it will feel foreign to them.

There MIGHT be something to do with Russia in regard to different movements like ""Mother Tongue""... but to be honest, I don't see the connection itself and I don't see much of the benefit for Russia itself. Many Latvian Russians are (and have been) disappointed at Russia that it actually did nothing to protect them here. So in a way Russia actually helped integration.

&gt;Essentially, what they agreed to are additional measures that are specifically designed to reduce the standard of living for the majority of the working population as a means of improving the nation’s competitiveness. Aside from firing civil servants, the new memoranda are all about major private sector wage cuts and an overhaul of labor rights.

This is from Polychroniou’s newest one-pager, “The New European Economic Dogma,” released yesterday.  Polychroniou takes on what he regards as the flawed ideology behind the policies that are being dumped on the Greek people; policies motivated by an ambiguous and, says Polychroniou, toxic conception of “competitiveness.”

Most people make a big deal out of this, but I don't think is all that serious: Catalan people believe that their language is endangered, so the catalan government pass bills to sanction economically the businesses that does not put all their signs and labels also in catalan language (among other things) and there is always much more help (in monetary terms) to initiatives fully carried in catalan (for example, if you are an amateur theatre company trying to get exposure... many things art related will find a home much easily if they are in catalan).


But in the other hand, to speak spanish inside cataluña is not frowned upon at all (as many would think). Even when you are talking to a really catalan person, if they sense that you don't understand catalan, many are happy to switch to spanish. Sure that there are people who don't want to switch and they are so proud that they rather lose all the conversation, but is rare.

I must say that I am currently studying in a private catalan university that offers education both in catalan and spanish. If you sign up for the spanish education you pay 4x times the price, why? because the catalan education receives a stipendium from the catalan government, so the government is in fact paying for a portion of your studies if you choose catalan language. The cool thing is: I have access to all the textbooks in spanish also, and if I wish to answer all the exams in spanish (although the questions are in catalan) is totally ok, they don't mind.


TL,DR: Many want to make it look like there is a big trauma with catalan people and their language, but the problems are very scarce.

We're not in a technical subreddit, here... and where the phrase ""service provider"" may be a wording accepted by networking professionals as meaning a specific thing, the same phrase can mean thousands of different things in common standard English. Those who write news articles can't be expected to know or abide by the finicky rules which technical people have about the use of generic English words. Folks from the ivory tower don't have the right to dictate the evolution of the English language, just because of their credentials. With some languages, there are academics who *do* decide the future of the language; this is the case with French and German. English is a free-form language that freely adopts foreign terms, and that changes meanings of words over time.

The point of the use of language is clarity. Your sentences need to point to what you are talking about very adeptly.

In my humble opinion, it's a very bad use of language when academics seek to stick phrases made up of generic words onto specific concepts. They're flirting with lack of clarity. For the same reason, I feel it's also a bad habit when they take nouns and try to make them into adjectives or verbs or vice versa. As I see it, this happens because people who go into the technical trades are often less skilled with language than those who get degrees in the humanities.

I would refer you to this article http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_American_football_and_rugby_union (dunno how to make pretty links in Alien Blue.)

Per the article, both modern rugby and modern American football share a common ancestor in 19th century Rugby football, hence the name; why wasn't rugby football called Rugby handegg? That I couldn't answer.

The ""breaks"" in play in American football give time for the referees to spot the ball (AF is played using a system of 4 downs--3 for Canadian--or tries [not Rugby tries] during which to advance the ball 10 yards. It also allows offenses and defenses to plan for the next play. 

Each play starts in something like a rugby scrum, except that possession isn't up for grabs. Complex schemes for blocking, passing, and running (as well as defenses to these) are practiced by teams for the offensive/defensive coordinator, head coach, and quarterback to choose from at game time. The offense and defense decide what play to run during breaks, and then line up. They can then adjust positioning and tactics before the snap based on what the other side is showing. 

There is a ""play clock"" that limits the length of these breaks, and teams may run a ""no-huddle"" offense with very short breaks as a way to fatigue or confuse the defense. 

Because play is in short bursts, planning and tactics become very important. There are specialized positions like wide receivers, who only (with rare exception) block defenders and try to catch forward passes, and defensive linemen, whose principal job is to penetrate the offensive line and tackle the quarterback or ball carrier. 

As for the armor...I'm not sure that  I could justify it because I know so little about rugby gameplay compared to AF. I do know that, historically, AF was almost banned due to the injuries it caused, making rule and equipment changes necessary, and equipment has kept pace with developments in technology and medicine. 

Concussions and repeated sub-concussive brain injuries are a long-term health risk for AF players, hence the helmets. Shoulder-first tackles are legal, though I don't know if this is due to shoulderpad use or vice-versa. 

I think the blocking aspect of AF makes armor more useful and more needed. I would also add that some players choose not to wear the (optional, soft) leg pads, opting only for the helmet and shoulderpads. 

If there's anything I can add to this long-winded post, or anything I can clarify I'd be happy to. 

Edit: the above replier's description of AF as ""a game of tactics between two coaches"" is extremely apt. ",0,1329598978,null,0,true,0,c3sl5c1,t3_puol5,t1_c3sl5c1,t1_c3skerh,null,1428378561,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,Kavec,null,null,"Bonjour,

Dire que les catalans ""ont réussi à protéger leur langue"" c'est peut-être une exagération. Réussir à ne pas la faire disparaître pour l'instant c'est peut-être plus juste. Mais c'est vrai que c'est quand même un exploit, parce que la situation était vraiment délicate après près de 40 ans de franquisme.

À mon avis le point le plus important pour mieux valoriser la langue était la TV3 (télévision catalane), avec des produits d'une très haute qualité qui à l'époque dépassaient tout autre produit télévisif. Surtout par rapport aux infants: les dessins animés qu'ils ont acheté (surtout Dragon Ball Z traduit au catalan) ont fait que les générations que aujourd'hui ont environ 30 ans connaissent très bien la langue catalane.

De toute façon le futur du catalan est plutôt noir. On ne peut pas protéger une langue sans frontières. Le fluxe constant des gens qui parlent l'espagnol et qui ont pas du tout besoin de faire l'effort de s'intégrer culturalement dans le nouveau introït où ils habitent sous le prétexte ""qu'il fait partie de l'Espagne"" (donc ils se sentent avec le droit de garder ses coutumes etc) fait que dans un état où plus du 80% des gens parlent la langue espagnole, toute autre langue est condamnée à disparaître.

Les efforts du gouvernement autonomique catalan pour sauvegarder la langue ont été étiqueté de ""fascistes"". Alors que même la France fait la même chose pour se protéger de l'anglais: ils ont des lois protectionnistes par rapport au cinéma et la musique. Mais évidemment l'intérêt des espagnols c'est d'enlever ""l'ennui catalan"", et c'est très compréhensible: c'est un bâton entre les roues à l'heure de planifier une éducation unifié pour tout l'état, ça fait consommer plus de ressources, etc.

C'est à cause de tout ça que certains catalans pensent que l'indépendance est l'unique solution au problème, puisque c'est impossible de trouver une stratégie ""win-win"" entre deux parties tellement différentes d'un état.

How do you say they are defining it?


Also, I haven't seen anyone correcting them, socialism almost equals liberalism to them it seems. I'd at least expect a lot of angry editorials on the uneducation of the politicians from newpapers, but they don't seem to care. Just from the top of my head I've heard several of the presidential candidates (Rick Perry comes to mind for example) and several senators calling Obama a socialist. 


[Here](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/29/nation/la-na-campaign-attacks-20120130) is Newt Gingtrich calling Obama pro European socialism  - and he was the speaker of the house.

[Here](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,808044,00.html) is a reference to Ron Paul claiming that the US is subsidising a socialist Germany.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I've made a lot of short cuts in my comments, mostly because every explanation raises some new questions that need explanations of their own. This leads to comments ""exploding"" and makes them difficult to follow. But since you asked:

&gt; On all your comments, you dont mention it directly but implied that the EU is a good thing and worth saving. Why?

I'm convinced the EU is a very good thing, although it of course has its flaws. What's much more relevant than this, though, and what I was referring to, is that a collapse of the EU would be extremely bad. Those are different things, you don't have to believe that the EU is good to recognize that a break-up would have very negative consequences. This difference might be more obvious if we look at the Eurozone, specifically.  
I believe that the euro is good in principle, but it has become fairly obvious by now that there are some rather significant issues with it that should have been solved before we took that step. You could reasonably argue that we would have been better off had we stuck with the old system, and I believe that for *some* of the members this would even be true, and you could still agree that reverting that step now that we have set this system up would be worse than trying to fix it.

Like with everything EU, we have to deal with a lot of compromises here, so it might be helpful to point out a few of the important axes along which the considerations that have to be weighted against each other lie:  

 * Economic vs. political (what may be politically wanted might have negative economic effects, and what would make economic sense might not be politically possible)  
 * Short term vs. long term (short term pain for long term gain, or the other way round)  
 * Nation-state-domestic vs. European (what's best for Europe as a whole could have negative consequences for individual members, be they Greece or Germany), and of course:  
 * Risk vs. possible reward.

Reasonable people may disagree about the respective weight they give to those, and how to best get there, but I think we can all agree that the main goals are to ensure the physical well being, followed by the best possible standard of living, in a long term sustainable manner for everybody.

Whether we talk about the Eurozone or the EU as a whole, it's common to think of them as primarily economic projects. This is of course an important aspect of them, but they are also motivated by politics, quite possibly even to a larger degree. The [Schuman Declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuman_Declaration) is still the guiding principle. [Intentional overstatement:] The EU is a very long term political project with positive economic side effects.

Originally, the main political motivation was long-term stability within Europe, from a national security perspective. The ""economic entanglement"" Schuman referred to actually does make war between members effectively impossible, on a technical basis. This came at a time right after WWII, with a generation of political leaders that had lived through another before that, and yet another major Franco-German one in living memory. They also knew that the next one would be even more devastating, perhaps ultimately so. That's a strong motivator, and, even though there are legitimate points of criticism when it gets to the details, a lot of what came after followed logically.   

Globalization is another reason why Europe should unite. Globalization is not a policy decision, but a natural phenomenon that emerges out of advancements in logistics and communication combined with mechanisms of how a market economy inherently works. We can't prevent it, but we can position us better to deal with it.  
In a globalized world, with a global economy and where policy decisions have global consequences, the European nation states are simply too small to have any meaningful influence individually. But as a whole, the EU will be able to see eye to eye with the US and the BRICs a few decades from now.  
This isn't just about the geopolitical future, but it's relevant today. Right now, a hot topic are the emission taxes that the EU wants to introduce on flights, something that the US and China oppose on behalf of their airlines. We'll see how this plays out, but had it been, say, Denmark, that had wanted to introduce such a policy unilaterally, the outcome would have been very easy to predict. The EU can introduce privacy regulations, and even non-EU companies can't avoid implementing them. As an EU resident (and *only* as an EU resident), you can write to Facebook and demand that they send you all the data they have about you, and they will comply. If Slovakia was on its own with those laws, well, no Facebook for Slovakia.  
This works within the EU as well. A company can outsource the data handling to another EU company, and be sure that the same regulations for handling the data apply. A beverage producer can buy plastic bottles from any supplier within the EU, and be sure that the material complies to food safety standards in the third EU country it exports to. If an individual member wanted to introduce environmental regulation, the additional cost would be a disadvantage for its domestic industry, compared to competitors in other countries that don't have the same requirements. If those regulations are EU-wide, the playing field is leveled, and those laws can be introduced without putting domestic industries at a disadvantage. Each country could develop, enact and control its own set of safety standards for, say, toys, but it's not only more efficient to centralize those controls, it also makes fulfilling them a requirement for access to the largest single market in the world, and manufacturers adapt their processes to meet them. Similarly, smartphone manufacturers quickly agreed on micro-USB as the standard for charging, because the EU said that otherwise it would decide for them.   
Of course, if we want common standards and common policy decisions for a common market, we need a way to agree on them. We can disagree about details of the process and which policy areas should be affected, but we do need something like the EU. If we want to remain geopolitically relevant in the long term, we'll even need to unify our foreign policy and military policy as well, two other areas of sovereignty that are just as touchy as national budgets and accounting, and ones that will require the necessary democratic legitimization to decide them on a European level.

You can see how widely this general idea is supported when you look at those countries that *aren't* in the EU. They tend to bend over backwards to implement demands that the EU has as a precondition for accession talks. Those who could have entered, but decided against it, still opted to be subject to market-relevant EU regulation as a price for access to it, without having any influence over the decision making process. Even among the British Euroskeptics, most seem to still want to remain a part of the single market, but I believe this is mostly due to a confusion between ""single market"" and a mere ""free trade area"". In other parts of the world, countries have begun to create their own single markets as well, out of a purely economic motivation.

&gt; Also, dont you think you should not try to paint the opposition to the EU as mindless populist while implying that the people trying to save it are the enlightened?

I had actually made sure to always speak of *populist* anti-EU movements to distinguish their goals from reasonable disagreements one might have about the details, speed and extend of European cooperation, or about how to emphasize short term national interests vs. long term European ones, or what those even might be exactly.

true,schlarp,null,null,"hey, i don't have much to add anymore, here's a few things:

* ""Same shit everywhere"": The most important thing. Don't think too much about differences in culture etc. IMO, in first world countries, things are all the same more or less. There are no strange local customs. High-five anyone you would high-five in Canada. A german high-five is chinking beer glasses / bottles :). You can absolutely do that with everyone. Say where you're from and you will be loved.

* About the being american thing: First of all, Germany is americanized like crazy. There's no real hate towards the US, probably just the same things canadians say or think about the US. Also, we are professionals at getting called nazis everywhere and we know how much generalizations and general stupidity like this hurts. Germans love and live US culture in many ways.

* I don't get the answers you got about the looking like a tourist thing. First of all, germans absolutely LOVE to see, help and talk to tourists because they never see any (at least in cities like Karlsruhe) and it makes us feel somewhat interesting, we're not used to that. If you want to really blend in, do/wear what you would do in Canada.

* About wanting to be liked / respected, maybe say: Hi, im ottawaguy, im from canada, i love it here. Maybe say something silly in german for some laughs, people love that shit. You don't need to speak any german. Nobody will think you are rude if you talk english to them. Pretty much everybody will speak and understand enough. Students / academics / taxi drivers / policemen / ... will all be able and LOVE to speak english with you, i promise. Maybe ask if someone speaks english first if you want to talk to them, just to let them know.

* As im writing this, there are several drunks yelling around in my street and having fun. No one cares (3.30 am). If its dark and not that many people around, just pee everywhere you would let your dog pee too, lol. Police obv. doesn't like it if you do it right in front of their eyes. I recently peed against a tree in a little park at night and 2 policemen walked right by me, they didn't give a fuck. Oh, on that note, Karlsruhe generally has a lot of police because there's the constitutional court and stuff like that in the city. But they're nice and usually don't care about public drunkenness.

* Just to let you know what me, a german 32 year old thinks about canada: We think you guys are the 'better' americans :). If i had to, i'd put you guys in the same category as sweden or norway. I know that you guys are pretty liberal, we've seen a lot about your country at the olympics (everybody watches them), i've seen all kenny vs. spenny and trailer park boys episodes and most of my friends / coworkers too. Oh right, thats a good conversation piece btw. Both shows did run on a smaller german tv channel, with german subtitles or even dubbed in german. Young people probably know it.

So, all in all, quit having so much respect for being in another country :). And never forget the #1 rule:

DON'T DRINK ""MONINGER"" BEER. It's disgusting.

If you'd like to, let us know how it went.

true,N_Sharma,null,null,"&gt; Bref, comme vous le voyez, je suis perplexe, mais je crois quand même que Sarko nous a bien aidé à surmonter les crises...

500 milliards d'euros de déficit en plus, voilà le prix pour ""surmonter"" la crise...qui n'est pas terminé ! A ce que je sais, l'Espagne est toujours dans la mouise (40% de chômage chez la jeunesse), et la Grèce n'a toujours pas fait défaut, ça ne saurait tarder. De nombreuses situations toxiques attendent aussi d'éclater en Europe ou de ré-éclater. La manière dont le contribuable a du payer pour sauver Dexxia par exemple est scandaleuse.

Je ne voterais peut-être pas, mais je ne comprends pas comment on peut voter pour un candidat parce qu'il (n') a (pas) fait à l'international plutôt que de regarder le bilan national et européen.
Les scandales attachés à l'entourage de Sarkozy, à la fois financiers et moraux, et sa politique nationale, voilà à quoi il faut juger ce monsieur.

 (Petite parenthèse, vous citez Chirac et Mitterrand a juste titre, et vous oubliez Karachi pour Sarkozy via son mentor Balladur. Le canard enchaîné est toujours instructif à ce sujet.)

La dette, le bouclier fiscal, la destruction de l'éducation et surtout la santé, cela me suffit pour me décider à ne pas voter Nicolas Sarkozy.
Enfin Sarkozy est un diviseur : diviser pour mieux régner, voilà son motto politique. Dans la difficile période qui s'annonce (car la crise n'est pas terminée !), nous avons besoin de quelqu'un capable de maintenir la paix sociale. Et Sarkozy n'est pas cet homme.

Sur l'international, 

La meilleure chose qui fut faite pour l'image internationale de la France ces dernières années a été le discours de Villepin, à l'ONU contre la guerre à l'Irak. Les conservateurs américains nous en ont voulu mais le monde arabe et une grande partie des émergents ont applaudi. Sarkozy par contre a presque détruit tout le travail de Chirac en coupant certains liens avec le monde arabe, et en se tenant derrière Israël. Ce n'est pas là l'intérêt de la France ; laissons aux américains le soin de soutenir Israël et prenons une position plus neutre. Israël n'a jamais rien fait pour nous depuis que nous leur avons donné la bombe ; nos liens avec le monde arabe nous donnent par contre une certaine influence mondiale, il s'agit après tout du second groupe ethnique mondial en terme d'importance démographique.

Pour revenir au conflit libyen, je suis aussi assez étonné de votre manière de réécrire l'histoire du conflit en Libye (on croirait ré-entendre Sarkozy le sauveur des infirmières bulgares), la Chine et la Russie n'ont pas plié devant la France, ne plieront jamais devant la France. Ils n'avaient que peu d'intérêts en Libye, par contre en Syrie on a vu la Chine et la Russie opposer un ferme véto. N'oublions pas aussi que le Brésil et l'Inde s'étaient exprimés contre la résolution sur la Libye. Simplement, aucune de ces puissants n'avaient d'intérêts nationaux en Libye suffisamment forts pour bloquer ce conflit à tout prix.

La France ne fut pas seule en Libye (France et Grande-Bretagne furent les principaux acteurs européens), et sans les ressources américaines, ce conflit n'aurait pas abouti (faites une recherche sur le nombre de missiles lancés par les Etats-Unis, et ceux lancés par la coalition européenne... nous sommes presque tombés en panne de munitions !). Par contre après ce conflit, la France est remontée dans l'estime de l'armée américaine puisque nos avions et notre soutien secret sur le terrain ont été efficace.


Bref, lisez le Canard, cela vous permettra d'avoir un regard plus objectif ; le Canard tape sur tout d'ailleurs, pas mal de choses croustillantes sur le PS y paraissent régulièrement. D'un côté nous avons les oligarchiques de l'UMP et de l'autre les barons locaux du PS. Pauvre France...

Empiezo a entender demasiado bien la desesperación Griega. Y eso que yo cuento con una red familiar que me mantiene casi ""como si nada"", no quiero pensar cómo de desesperados estarán quienes no tengan a quién acudir.
Esto es una pena de las grandes, en serio, no sabéis como se siente estar aquí ""encerrado"" ahora mismo...
