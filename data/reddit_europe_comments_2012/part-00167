true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  Eventually all non-renewable energy sources will be more expensive than solar/wind/fusion; when that happens in 20~25 years you'll get a market for renewables. It's already inevitable.

At the current rate, it won't even take that long, but that's because there already is a market, albeit an artificial one. Depending on location, we already have grid parity for wind, and in places like Italy even PV is very close. What drives the rapid reduction in cost is only partially due to improved technology, much of the cost is production know-how and well tuned supply chains. To develop that, you need actual for-profit production. It's not as if a boffin in a white coat could walk out of her lab one day and you could use her plans for super efficient solar cells to satisfy global demand over night. You need production facilities and supply chains, and they improve their efficiency with the experience they made with previous production facilities just as the technology itself improves. This is as true for production processes for the panels and converters as it is for the cells and the production of the silicon they're made of. Even the best possible plant for cell production is useless if there aren't enough producers for the silicon.  
This is even true for just the installation. Not a big deal, right? And yet, despite the cost for the parts being the same, the actual installation costs half as much in Germany as it does in the US, because German businesses have been doing it for a while now and the market is better developed.  
All this, the more effective production through incremental market driven refinements is doing much more for bringing prices down than a couple percent improved conversion rate. Even if you could build supply chains and production facilities for a global market within a year ""when we get there"", those would effectively be first generation facilities and you'd have to deal with the problem that the technology would be unproven under real world conditions. 

It doesn't even end there, we need the technology for a grid that can handle massively decentralized production, and we need the technology for interim storage as well as the facilities. Again, something that needs to be grown and improved incrementally. Even on the consumer side, things like heating elements and household appliances that can be controlled by smart meters to draw energy when there is a surplus and delay consumption when on demand need to get rolled out, and those are things that people don't replace every year.

&gt; Research into thorium and other types of reactors is still being done and some groups are close to new designs and new fuel sources. 

That's great. Hopefully somebody will build a few somewhere when we get there so the technology can prove itself, and we'll see where renewables will be by then. But the last German nuclear reactor began construction thirty years ago and began construction in 1989. Even if this technology would become available within ten years, we'd need another ten from the initial planning to actual production and then the new technology still wouldn't have a track records to look at.  
That thorium pebble bed HTR I mentioned above was supposed to bring se, cheap and reliable energy as well. It wasn't closed down due to the leakage,af the operator didn't even lose its license because of the failed cover-up, it went bankrupt due to a string of unforeseen reliability issues years later.

&gt;  We've already done damage to the planet and the more fossil fuels we burn the more damage we do.

Oh, I absolutely agree with that, which is why I said I would have accepted to run the existing nuclear plants for (just) a few years longer if it meant switching off some coal fired plants instead. But the future is in wind and solar, not in current generation nuclear, and I think I've made my point why I'm convinced that we have to start building a renewable energy industry *now* and bring it to scale. 

I really wish Reddit would be as focused on things like building codes and ridiculously low energy prices in the US as it is about Germany's nuclear exit. The cleanest energy is still the one we don't use. ",0,1354032208,null,0,false,0,c77jtxr,t3_13ucas,t1_c77jtxr,t1_c77ikhz,null,1430513692,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Show me the figures. There might be a short term increase because the current government has switched off many plants right away after reverting the previously negotiated phase-out only to reverse course again six months later, but so far it seems as if we're on track in the longer term.

Contrary to popular argument I neither read the Daily Mail, did not have my choice swayed by an admittedly Machiavellian NO campaign or a limp lettuced, hobbled at birth by its own appointed chief advocate, poorly argued YES campaign.

I actually like 'First Past The Post' in that whilst I also advocate that any wannabe MP should have a specific MP qualification or license to run, it is in itself, getting elected, a trial by fire.  It does take *some* skill to take on all comers and get the most votes.  I see it as a qualifier!

I'm not opposed to voting reform, or more accurately constituency and donation/lobbyist reform, but this wasn't it and I didn't see it as a step in the right direction either, which is the other argument one hears.

true,ajuc,POLA,Poland," &gt; Also, I fear you're taking this too naively. What you say only holds if total output of the economy is unchanged. If there's slack in the economy, and there is, and if ""printing money"" mobilises that slack, there need not be inflation. As I said before - if these people spend their wages demanding goods and services and the private sector can grow to meet their demand rather than raise prices - where's the inflation? Yes there's more money in the economy - there's also more production, and why would the breadmakers/candlestick makers be raising prices if they have excess capacity?

Yeah, we're speaking about naive, idealized conditions (I've stated explicitly the assumption that funded guaranteed job will be useless like digging a hole and filling it again). That useless job doesn't really increase economy size, cause nobody needs the results.

So we have more money == more demand for the things people actually want to buy, but same amount of the things people actually want, so the prices for these things will increase.

Of course if we produced things that people actually want, this changes. But government is really, really bad at this, mainly because people love to game the bureaucratic machine, and controlling them to prevent that is hard (and it's another job that's only overhead and doesn't really add value, and then you need to control the controllers, etc, etc).

I've seen how EU funds for education of workforce are used. It's basically what you propose - paying the teachers to inject money into economy, even if nobody really needs the thing they teach (my wife was on 2 such courses about EU funds and about bookkeeping when she was unemployed - it's one huge scam, teachers weren't teaching anything, one even showed the class action movies during classes on her laptop to ""pass time"").

1. Isn't that what the EU is all about (increasing trade and reducing barriers) to allow people more freedom in their ability to live and work within the EU?

 It might lower wages in some industries, but it also means that Germany and other countries have more labor to expand their economies and become even more competitive.That sort of thing should make everyone better off as barriers are removed and trade/employment increases across the EU. Besides new arrivals would still have a disadvantage when it comes to learning the language, and the movement hasn't been that widespread despite efforts to increase mobility (at least from what I've read)...not an expert on this by any means.

2. How would this impose jobs on workers? They're just improving their data to increase people's opportunities abroad if they're interested. If the wages are too low, then people will refuse to move.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; So we have more money == more demand for the things people actually want to buy, but same amount of the things people actually want, so the prices for these things will increase.

You don't realise it, but you're arguing that we currently have **no** room for output growth for goods/services that the currently unemployed will demand. That the private sector is at capacity, producing all it can, and that if the currently unemployed were to start demanding goods and services - rather than output increasing, prices would increase.

Just think about what a ludricrous proposition this is. There's **heaps** of excess capacity today - half the population of Greece/Spain would work more hours if only there was more demand for their output. Half the youth are unemployed. One in four workers can't find a job.

I find it ridiculous to say that output cannot grow to meet increased demand. That prices must rise instead. And the ECB agrees with me - it's currently encouraging as much spending/money creation as it can. Unfortunately, this is proving insufficient to have the private sectors of Greece/Spain dissave enough to provide for full employment.

&gt; Of course if we produced things that people actually want, this changes. But government is really, really bad at this, 

The whole point is not to have the government try and replace the private sector. It's to *grow* the private sector. The private sector + public sector is currently far too small, leaving people unemployed. If we give those people a wage, the private sector will grow to meet their demand. There's plenty of room for growth, and so prices need not rise. It's not to have the government try and figure out what goods/services we need and *replace* the private sector - it's to *grow* the private sector, quite the opposite.

Again, quite simply, MMT (correctly) observes that we have masses of potential before us today, currently going wasted. Just like the ECB, it believes this potential is going unused due to insufficient spending, and that if only we could get more spending to occur - output would rise, not prices. They then go on to say that if only these nations weren't stuck to the Euro, they'd have no difficulty providing the necessary money for full employment to be reached. Which doesn't simply mean a larger public sector, it means a larger private sector too (as that's where public sector employees spend their wages!). But alas, that's not the case, and so instead we have to have all these resources go idle whilst waiting for internal devaluation to settle in - a process that may take a full decade, and we have to live with the ramifications of the meantime widespread unemployment for a whole lot longer.",0,1354037358,null,0,false,0,c77lbby,t3_13u0vh,t1_c77lbby,t1_c77kyir,null,1430514384,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

If you are going to be a resident of Germany, you have to speak German. This is how Germany (or Gesetzgeber) sees it. As simple as that. Most of the native population also agree.

If you are applying a job, German language proficiency (to some extent) is a requirement almost everywhere. Even in academia, finding a position in Germany is quite difficult if you can not speak German. For master degrees, some German course is obligatory. In a working environment (industry or academia) your German coworkers expect you to speak in German. And if you can't even though you have been in Germany for say 2-3 years, it is not major problem, but people have the opinion that you are resisting to learn German and that is why you still can not speak it.

I totally understand Germany's political stance and also the public opinion that sees German proficiency being a must. It's because Germany has been trying to take measures for years now against the immigrants who fail to adapt the laws of the country they now live. But it is more than that. Minority groups have generally a lower social-economic level. They are not as good educated as the Germans. Needless to say, Germany wants to improve the life standards of immigrants. To this end, especially in the last years, they have been more serious about their Ausländer-Politik. Now, if you can't speak German you are not encouraged to reside in Germany.

However, I believe, this attitude brings some problems with it. I don't think that forcing immigrants to speak German will solve all the problems of the Immigrants. Sure that will help. But I think one has to look for the problem on some deeper levels.

For one, forcing someone to speak a language does not look really the most ethical thing to do. The  problem emerged from the assumption that Germany thought that the Gastarbeiter would indeed be Gäste. But they settled. And now Germany enforces them to adapt. Some of them can not and could not even. Germany just accepted the low-skilled immigrants coming from very distinct cultures which have nothing to do with the German way of living, and of course now suffers from these people being the ones with low social level. How surprising.

BTW, my experience is limited to Germany but the Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden... they all have the similar issues.

Also, from a realistic point of view, the requirement of the German language proficiency limits all kind of immigration, not just that of the unskilled workers. For example Germany wants to compete in academia with the USA and the UK. This certainly won't happen due to this requirement. No high-skilled immigrant will consider moving Germany under these circumstances. The same holds also for the industry. This is a severe limitation.

I think the Ausländer-Politik should be improved by considering it's evident disadvantages and limitations.",0,1354038520,null,0,false,0,c77lnov,t3_13v7ba,t1_c77lnov,t1_c77hxuy,null,1430514615,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

------

Do you think the EU as a whole (or even just workers) would be better off without the monetary union? 

Some of the problems could be fixed through reforms. There's really no reason for doctors to have localized certification, they could just have an EU body to set standards and supplementary training as needed. In the US we have state certification for teachers, architects and other professions. There's been an effort to streamline the process in a way that maintains relevant local standards, but allows more reciprocity...which makes it easier for people in these professions to move around and practice as they see fit. 

The pension system is a bit more difficult. If they are paid through some kind of payroll tax, maybe they can take it with them. (As in they continue paying taxes to their home country to remain eligible for that pension...rather then having workers jump in and out of different systems as they move around.) At the very least that would provide greater stability to Southern countries, limit fears in host countries about the state of their welfare in the future....as these workers wouldn't qualify, and it would eliminate the need for a federal pension system, which people generally oppose.

I'm not sure how these things are funded, but in the US our SS is covered under a payroll tax that everyone pays, and it doesn't matter where you live.

true,Ozires,FINL,Finland,"On you conclusion, I agree wholeheartedly and I think the question of catering to the gifted kids is often blown out of proportion. But I'd just like to add my opinion.

The whole problem has a lot less to do with 'letting kids be kids' than some of them just being *so* bored. When I was in elementary school (and really once even in high school, even though I did go to one of the best ones in Finland, just flippantly) I used to finish the whole maths book or english book or whatever during the first few weeks, all the exercises. I liked it and I wanted to do more of it, but after that there was nothing to do. You could just either sit and listen to people go over the old stuff or then just wonder off and think of something else. Once a maths teacher even made me erase all the assignments I'd done in the entire exercise book and do them again with the rest of the group because you weren't allowed to do them beforehand (though here I blame the teacher more and I don't in any way claim this is representative of the Finnish education system). 

Point is, if we'd just had something to do, like extra exercises or anything, it would've made my existence so much less annoying. I absolutely agree with posters here saying that 'gifted children' can come up with their own challenges, because they have the extra energy to do this (Maybe this is the Finn in me, but I find it somehow just wrong to in any way to single myself out as somehow better than anyone else; really I think that's a great way of making all kids less asshole-ish). Especially, if they have parents that take the time (or have the possibility) to spend time with them. They're the ones that introduce you to reading all sorts of books, which you can then expand on yourself. The kids who struggle obviously need the attention of the school system a lot more than any kid who overperforms, and I also think we've probably gotten better at supporting the performers too. 

Though, I'd just like to add that Finns are really good at dissing themselves and to think that something we have would be the best in the world is just completely counter-intuitive. This is unimportant, cold, shitty little Finland after all. We see all sorts of issues going on at school; the occasional bad teachers etc and make a big deal out of it, even though when you really stop to think about the education system, overall it really is pretty good.",0,1354042602,null,0,false,0,c77mujk,t3_13v9qu,t1_c77mujk,t1_c77m6hz,null,1430515176,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Some kids do fine, especially if they have supportive parents, but many don't.

Also, I don't really see why it's ok to waste intellectual potential like this when children are supported in the pursuit of excellence in other ways: everyone knows that you have to take up an instrument at a young age if you want to play it really well, and kids who are into sports are often pushed and helped.

&gt; they'd learnt it before, or very quickly

See the contradiction here? At least if I understood what you were trying to say correctly. It's not like because of boredom these kids are not actually learning the material and getting behind even ""normal"" kids.

I won't deny there's a potential for boredom in schools. What I do think is being overemphasised is what being smart has to do with it. Some things in school are very boring. And even intellectually superior kids don't find everything interesting. 

Bullying should be addressed no doubt. But that's not an exact correlation with being smarter either.

&gt; Also, I don't really see why it's ok to waste intellectual potential like this

Woah there, this is what I meant in my previous comment, and the questions I posed remain unanswered. 

&gt; Do we really want to waste human potential in the things that really matter?

But what exactly is being wasted? Anything even remotely useful for society (perhaps with the exception of music, indeed) is learnt much, much later in life, at the university level. I'd like to think musically talented and inclined children would be captured by the school's **regular** music program. But otherwise, and that was my main point, school, aside from having a very important role in giving the population a lowest-common-denominator education, is also the place where children learn equally important social and life skills. My impression is that segregation would have an overall far more negative impact in this regard than the (big-picture) relatively-unimportant achievement of teaching an 11 year-old to do engineering entry-level calculus. Which would achieve, what, exactly? Save him a few months or years when university time came? 

This was, BTW what I always perceived (even at my age then) as the underlying drama in the series ""Douguie Houser, MD"".

L'urgenza di potere non mi spaventa. Mi pare che serva qualcuno che smuova le acque così nel PD. Non dico che lo faccia in modo disinteressato, ma credo che non ci sia niente di male. Magari mi sbaglio e diventerà davvero un malefico satrapo. Alle primarie per il sindaco ha corso contro l'espresso ordine del partito che aveva un altro candidato, Cioni (peraltro accusato di corruzione in uno strano affaire con Ligresti), vecchio esponente del PCI, che disse una cosa tipo ""ragazzino mettiti in fila"". Avrà corso per sete di potere. Fatto sta che Renzi il sindaco secondo me l'ha fatto e anche bene, sicuramente meglio degli ultimi insignificanti personaggi del PDS/DS che avevano governato la città, soffrendo di un immobilismo che era diventato proverbiale. Ricordo a tutti che all'epoca (anche per questo) c'era il rischio che la città andasse al PDL (sarebbe stata la prima volta di un sindaco di destra). A Prato è successo: la sinistra è stata a livello locale specchio dei limiti della sinistra nazionale. Il PDL ha vinto. A Prato ora ci sono le ronde polizia+esercito, un assessore che quando la Polizia manganella in piazza dice che le botte son sempre poche, un altro che dice cose così pesanti sugli immigrati da far schifare persino il vescovo. Sarebbe stato meglio Renzi, credo. 

Il fatto è che i burocrati del PD vivacchiano in una paralisi fuori dal tempo e fuori dal mondo. Alle primarie per la candidatura a sindaco lui si propose con convinzione, con delle idee convincenti; certo è un paraculo e questo dà fastidio, ma dopo essere stato intransigente per tanti anni ho pensato che forse serve questo genere di paraculaggine per parlare a un numero di italiani che ti facciano vincere le elezioni. Parla alla furba e da democristiano. Ma le ultime elezioni la sinistra le ha vinte con Prodi, che tanto diverso non era (era meglio, ok). 

Sarebbe l'ora che la sinistra smettesse di tenere quell'atteggiamento di sufficienza e superiorità, alla D'Alema. Ci siamo lamentati per anni che mancassero nel PD i grandi comunicatori (al di là dell'enorme equivoci su Berlusconi: lui non è un grande comunicatore, è uno che controlla la comunicazione). Renzi comunica, questo è certo. Ci può far schifo e possiamo non condividere il programma, questo è vero. 

E forse la mia scelta la dice lunga su quanto veramente non se ne possa più dell'apparato corrente del PD. Con alternative come Bersani e l'ala di ex-comunisti ed ex-DC che perdono elezioni da vent'anni e che sono ancora lì, c'è poco da fare gli schizzinosi. Come notava qualcun altro nel thread, questo ragionamento può disgustare, io lo trovo realista. 

Diciamo dunque che queste cose che dici mi inorridiscono, ma il programma (al di là di qualche limite su cui possiamo discutere) non è male e lui rappresenta una speranza di governare. Queste cose mi inorridiscono, ma le alternative (da Bersani al PDL a Monti) mi inorridiscono di gran lunga di più. 
Scusa la lunghezza. 

**TL; DR: Renzi è un paraculo ma *nonostante ciò* mi disgusta meno di tutto il resto della banda.**

&gt;What About Spending Increases?

&gt;According to another popular theory, additional spending on education will 
yield gains in test scores. To see whether expenditure theory can account 
for the interstate variation, we plotted test-score gains against increments 
in spending between 1990 and 2009. As can be seen from the scattering 
of states into all parts of Figure 9, the data offer precious little support 
for the theory. Just about as many high-spending states showed relatively 
small gains as showed large ones. Maryland, Massachusetts, and New 
Jersey enjoyed substantial gains in student performance after committing 
substantial new fiscal resources. But other states with large spending 
increments—New York, Wyoming, and West Virginia, for example—had 
only marginal test-score gains to show for all that additional expenditure. 
And many states defied the theory by showing gains even when they did not 
commit much in the way of additional resources. It is true that spending 
and achievement gains have a slight positive relationship, but the 0.12 
correlation between new expenditure and test-score gain is of no statistical 
or substantive significance. On average, an additional $1,000 in per-pupil 
spending is associated with a trivial annual gain in achievement of one-tenth 
of 1 percent of a standard deviation. [source](http://www.hks.harvard.edu/pepg/PDF/Papers/PEPG12-03_CatchingUp.pdf)",0,1354044160,null,0,false,0,c77nb7r,t3_13v9qu,t1_c77nb7r,t1_c77luev,null,1430515393,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,_sik,FINL,Finland,"&gt;However, the education **level** of the top 2 percent in Finland is likely lower than in America, Russia or Germany.

I assume you meant **quality** of education, as we're a degree and qualification mad country that probably spends too much time in schools as it is!

I hear some form of that argument from Finns too, but there are several criticisms: 

1) Once people get to upper secondary school level (age ~15-18) there are free but selective specialist schools here. 

2) There are studies that show that *quantity* of homework (something I'd think they stressed in Russia, China etc.) isn't related to kids' performance on standardised tests like the ones for PISA. Having homework that's ""too easy"" might actually mean that kids have time for important and fun stuff that helps their development.

3) Giving extra resources to the ""problem students"" improves the working atmosphere in the classroom, and gives the teacher time and energy to focus on the remaining students (there's probably an 80-20 rule at work here). At the top end talent is normally distributed, so it's not as clear cut or fair to separate the worthy and unworthy students.

4) Somebody in this thread already said that to some extent smart kids are capable of creating their own stimulation and challenges. There's also the related nature/nurture debate about how much formal education really matters.

5) Finland is such a small country that there's usually one go-to place or school for a given field or subject, so it's easy to get well-networked, which I guess factors into quality of education. 

I don't think we have a perfect system however: for instance we'd need to import the concept of ""mathlete"" and maths/science could use something equivalent to the widespread ""music classes"" that we have (that is an entire class of students that gets extra music teaching, selection into the class is based on musical aptitude).

The fun point is that people that do not speak the same dialect gradually change their speech towards something in the direction of high German, but never totally. (Unless forced like in elementary school when children learn to read, or at the national news on TV).

If people grow up in a mixed environment, which they normally do, they only develop an accent but not a full dialect .So heavy dialect is nowadays very seldom in daily life (short count from work, 5 speak with accent, ok one with Ukrainian, 2 only high German and just one with heavy lower Bavarian dialect). 

If one got a little grasp of language dialects are mutual intelligible to a very high extend, but each carries a certain cultural implication. Which leads to your question, an accent free character, let's say on TV is used to not interfere with cultural differences or stereotypes. 

The viewer can identify with the character without borders if you will. In the meantime a high German speaking household is not unbelievable at all, there are so many of them that it would be a cultural nudge if the character suddenly changes syntax when at home.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Namely the swaths of unemployed people we have right now might disagree with you. 

The unemployed are caused by a negative environment for the economy to grow, not because the currency here is the same it is in France or Finland.

&gt;Except that thanks to the Euro we don't produce much these days as it's much cheaper to produce elsewhere. It's also a lot easier to import, namely goods that we couldn't afford and totally ruined our balance of trade. 

Our balance of trade has been negative for decades, only now it's showing signs of recovery.

A different currency is a barrier for trade, and the argument for having an own currency so that we can devalue to improve trade goes down the drain when that said devaluation has a negative impact on the whole economy (as everyone's net worth is negatively affected), when changing to a different currency would mean your exports would need to be converted to another currency within the Eurozone (our largest market) and when you have a lot of products which you need to import no matter what (so we'd experience harsh inflation). So you can't really blame our negative balance of trade on the euro, our largest market also has it and changing the currency away from it would have quite severe impacts to our exports - and you really don't want to compete on the same level as the East Asians.

&gt;Since you're someone who is against the minimum wage

I'm not, I'm against our system of minimum wage. I'm for a minimum wage similar to that of Italy, Austria, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway where isn't not an arbitrary value imposed to everyone equally.

&gt;You actually appear to be some kind of gold standard supporter which is what the Euro pretty much is these days. 

Gold standard? Don't confuse me with those US Libertarians who want to go back in time back to the days before Central Banks or with the Austrians that think that currency should be privately issued.

What I'm for is simply a stable European currency so that there's less restrictions to trade and so that politicians can't get away with constantly devaluing the currency since it's unpopular for them to increase taxes or cut spending.

&gt;You seem to only want to see the good things with the Euro, when the bad things are now blatantly obvious and the willingness in Europe to deal with monetary union problems, from either politicians or their electorates, is quite non existing.

Which blatantly obvious bad things? The only one I can think of is that we can no longer devalue it at will, and I don't really consider it a bad thing.

&gt;In fact many Europeans seem to insist that there is no problem with the EMU, the only problem for them are dumb and lazy southerners requiring some protestant education. 

That stupid and you know it. Some retards call us dumb and lazy, other retards say those who refuse to give us more money are nazis, so yeah, there's retards everywhere, ignore them, they're not the problem, the problem was our constant public deficits and the delaying in paying them - unfortunately for us, we can't just keep delaying the payment of our obligations and expect that people continue to supply us the cheap money.

&gt;I would love for us to be in a fiscal union, I'd love for us to have a functioning central bank like the US, I'd love Europeans to be glad to support one another, I'd love world peace. Sadly none of these things appear to be happening any time soon. 

Yup, I agree with all of this. However, just because these don't seem they will happen any time soon, we shouldn't backtrack and scrap that which we've already achieved.

The UK economy won't collapse, but you certainly won't benefit from leaving the EU. Let me give an example. Now, while you're in the EU, you have a say in what goes in the trade treaties, but if you leave - you have zero say. Switzerland, is outside the EU, but if it wants an access to the EU market, it has to agree to every EU trade agreement, and they have zero say in what goes in it. Also, the same with Norway. Do you really want the UK to be like this? (Over 45% of your trade is with the EU. That'd be a big loss, wouldn't it?)

In the US the movement isn't always back and forth equally. There are many states and cities that experience consistent population loss. It started with the rust belt cities in the North-east as people and companies moved South and then West. For instance Houston has been gaining people, and Detroit has been losing people for many years. 

 Also, most of our funding for education is at the State/local level, so it's not uncommon for individual states to experience losses. Even in higher education some states have generous scholarship programs or subsidies for in-state students...which ultimately end with the student graduating and moving elsewhere. 

You're absolutely right about the federal money transfers. In many ways that allows the US to exist as a large unified country in spite of economic and demographic disparities among the States. Do you think the EU will ever generate this kind of system? 

Is there another alternative that props up countries as they lose population without a federal transfer? Maybe some kind of tax/benefit system that follows workers as they move around the EU?

It's the second largest city of Slovenia, beautiful, not to big and really in nice shape, I occasionally visit it if I'm bored and want to ""go abroad"" :)

&gt; Looking at the pictures and saying it as a Hungarian, the buildings are in good repair and resemble a Western country like Austria much more than most post-Communist countries.

The only visible difference between Graz and Maribor (and Ljubljana too), for me, is the language on the signs. I feel more ""at home"" in Slovenia than in Germany, it just looks and feels so much like here. That's probably due to the fact that Maribor was an Austrian city until WW1 (the region was called Lower Styria, that's also the reason why we have a Upper and Central Styria but no Lower Styria, the southern part of the now a days Styria is called Southern Styria, creative name, I know). 

&gt; So apparently although Slovenia does have corruption it does not cripple this small country as much as most of us. Good on you.

See the [corruption index for 2011](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2011/dec/01/world-corruption-index-transparency-international-map) (Here some not so randomly picked data)

Slovenia Ranked 35  
Hungary Ranked 54  
Austria Ranked 16  
Germany Ranked 14  
Italy Ranked 69  
Croatia Ranked 66  
New Zeeland Ranked 1  
Denmark + Finland Ranked 2

So Hungary and Slovenia are in the transition zone between ""not really corrupt"" and ""quite corrupt"", but Slovenia is on a significant better step than Hungary.

Sure, but the currency is certainly part of that environment. You realize the EMU doesn't have almost any of the characteristics associated with an [optimum currency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_currency_area#OCA_with_stationary_expectations) therefore it is not only inefficient it has a negative effect.  
  
&gt; so that politicians can't get away with constantly devaluing the currency since it's unpopular for them to increase taxes or cut spending.
  
Yeah and that is a great effect of the Euro during good times, but in the bad times when everyone, not just the government, is indebted and you're in a vicious circle this is exactly what you need. You lose the ability to do that.

In Germany ""High German"" is a language every educated person speaks and understands. Not because you were taught it in school, but because it is everywhere in the media and because most people speak it in their daily life. It is the standard. 

EDIT: This is also why it doesn't seem suspicious when people speak high German in TV.

In some families, regional Dialects are spoken more or less strongly. A Dialect is basically a different pronunciation of the high language, enriched with some special words. Most Dialects are easily understandable for every German.

A little minority does only speak their regional dialect. Those people are also often hard to understand because their Dialect is very strong pronounced.

Lisbon treaty isn't a constitution:

It's a basis for a constitution in the future, but it isn't one now.

There isn't a limit to how many times you can put a referendum, therefore they did it within the law in Ireland. A lot of people don't like some laws, and think they got through with corruption, but it isn't the case with Lisbon Treaty.

Not [according to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent_%28linguistics%29).

&gt; In linguistics, an accent is a manner of pronunciation peculiar to a particular individual, location, or nation.[1] An accent may identify the locality in which its speakers reside (a geographical or regional accent), the socio-economic status of its speakers, their ethnicity, their caste or social class, their first language (when the language in which the accent is heard is not their native language), and so on.[2]

I'm not going to pretend, as many do, that it makes a huge difference across the grand scheme - in most local elections there'd be no change.  It just makes for more political mayonnaise of people appealing to other groups rather than sticking to what they mean and believe.


However, if there is a significant party that polarises the vote, as in people would never ever put them as choice two - and they now knew under PR that 'choice three or four' would count, there'd be a move made to monopolise the consensus vote  to put influence with the secondary and third parties. 

They know they can't win a straight race but they identify in polls who comes second and third and devise a shared agreement.

              Most people might like marmite on their, but raspberry jam a close third throws its weight 
              behind strawberry.  Strawberry and Raspberry run a consortium keeping marmite, the

It's the political act of actually alienating the biggest single group because it doesn't have the +50% majority, because there's other minority groups.

What we need is either to reduce public spending and to grow the economy - a more attractive business environment and a government without chronic deficits. All other alternatives either further the initial problem (""we should increase spending to kick-start the economy"") or compromise the EU integrity (""the wealthier countries should pay for the mistakes of others"") - sure, not all government spending is bad and not all EU funds compromise the stability of the Union, but we can't expect for our problems to be solved by others, most of the work will have to come for us, it all comes back to addressing the problem of our state spending much more than what it can get through revenues.

&gt;It's only counter-productive if there's a good chance that Europe will move forward any time soon (and soon is quite important here). We must consider that may not be the case and get ready. Discussing the pros and cons honestly is a good start.

For years Germany was not the first and not even the second choice for educated immigrants. There is a variety of reasons, but mostly the prehistory, the society's limited acceptance of ""Ausländer"", the language barrier and the social glass ceiling. Also, the sort of opportunities provided: Germans just basically needed to dirty work to be done by the Turkish guy, while the white man continues to carry his burden undisturbed. 

Unlike US or Canada, Germany built a reputation not a country where people strive to move in order to get rich and prosper. Mostly, people moved here from the outskirts of Europe and the South to escape subsistence and to have stable income and a piece of bread and butter on their table. 

As a result, Germany absorbed less ""quality"" tiers of immigrants (both educationally and culturally). Now, years later they are wondering why the hell the lady that moved from a medieval Turkish village does not speak any German and think that some ""Integrationskurs"" would fix that. Or better, whining and bitching that those north African immigrants did not fulfill their expectation and still sell tomatoes instead of doing rocket science.

We're still above average, but we're slowly approaching the middle of the pack. The same is true for many other metrics as other countries improve at faster rates. 

I think saying that we're one of the best is slightly optimistic, especially given the larger trends. We need to keep perspective if we want to maintain our advantage (not that tertiary education is the only way to do that, but it's a factor.)

true,redlightsaber,ESPA,Spain,"&gt; I just meant that 90% of school time was spent on not learning anything.

Except for the aforementioned social and life skills, which is no small feat.

&gt; It doesn't have to be that way. Many remarkable people have started at a young age. Terence Tao was doing university maths by age nine.

And I'd do obscene things to be permitted to be Terence Tao's psychoanalyst. My hypothesis is that, at 9 years of age, spending a huge amount of time doing what highly educated young adults are usually paid for (while not even getting the pay or even the ""appropriate"" peer recognition an adult would), while probably awesome for building a curriculum for later life (and I do mean decades later), may be not such a great thing for the development of a child's psyche. To put it another way: just because kids **can** be put to work in assembly lines in factories (as they once were, in fact), doesn't mean they should. As much as the child (who has not even close to a complete [or much at all] superego, ie: whose value systems are heavily reliant on their primary caretakers) seems to ""enjoy"" it. But hey, I do hope the guy is genuinely happy and that I'm wrong on some level.

&gt; I agree, and it's important to design schools to accommodate both this and the different intellectual needs of different children. I believe it can and should be done!

Perhaps.

Of course, 50 points in PISA is a lot to catch up, but if the assumption about the SD is correct, there will always be a percentage where that happens. This is most likely the result of most of the teaching resources going into the poorly performing students instead of the well performing students.

However, when comparing middle school scores, it's easy to forget that Finland does some very heavy selection at around ages 15-16. Specifically, around the best 50% of the cohort goes to the academic high school, and the university students are selected almost exclusively from that population.

However, the difference is large! Looking at the PISA data, it seems that the standard deviation of test scores in the US is around 106 for 2009 sciences test. The point difference between USA and Finland is 74. Plugging those numbers into a normal distribution cumulative probability equation, we see that the best 24.5% of the US students are at the level of a mean Finnish student. 

In fact, we can calculate what is the percentage we need to look at to see an equality in the student quality. I'm not going to start solving the equation, but plugging the numbers iteratively (Finland's SD is 85), we see that US pulls ahead somewhere after 99.9% and before 99.99%.

**TL;DR** Between one-in-a-thousand and one-in-ten-thousands frequencies USA starts to have a better quality of students. That is, if we take randomly somewhere between 1000 and 10000 students (for the argument's sake let's say it is 5000) from both countries, each group's best student in science is approximately as good. For larger groups the best kid of USA is better than that of Finland, and for smaller groups the Finnish one is.

Edit: Right, I un-lazied myself. The equality in science happens at 99.9616% with 2006 test results.

Edit: For math, if I calculated correctly (and my solver did its job reliably), the equality happens at 99.999999999999989%. This is a result of much smaller difference in standard deviation with the same point difference. That means that if we pick a group of student from each country, each group consisting of 10^16 students, the best US student beats the best Finnish student in math.

But you know what? Eventually, I adapted, and I succeeded, as I assume you've done as well. Perhaps others have not. 

My only discrepancy with your story is that I saw the rest of university students struggling equally than me. Some of them got better grades, but then again that is not equal to not struggling, since I consider spending 8 hours a day (not even during exams time), if not a struggle, at the very least not a great life. And not one I wanted for me, at any rate.

In a philosophical sense, maybe it makes sense to want to make kids never let their guards down to acquire study habits that'll prevent them from failing in university. However, I think that's perfectly possible within the frame of the normal schooling system. I do blame my parents (in a matter-of-fact way, not like I resent them or anything) for not forcing me to acquire good study habits, needless as they might have been during my school years. 

But in the end it's all good. Everyone struggles in life, and that part of mine was my personal struggle at least up to this point.

true,Asyx,NRWW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"Everybody speaks high German and everybody knows the High German vocabulary. Dialects are pretty dumbed down and mostly the accent is to hear and a few (and I really mean a few) words are left.

Sometimes, people stick to grammatical features that a dialect has developed or a dialect has kept from old German (like the continuous form ""Ich bin am essen"" for example) but that's not very common since it's not a good thing outside of your region.

I can't really say what's going on in smaller towns or villages. But in general, dialects on TV are only to find if it fits into the theme (like a series that plays in a Bavarian small town. Nobody there will speak High German and I can't understand those people). If it's something like a homeless guy in a series who is from the north, he will have the typical north accent but it's no way near comparable to the actual dialect.

Dialects in German are very different from each other. Even if 2 cities are fairly close together, it's not guaranteed that you can actually understand proper spoken dialect there. Example: Cologne and Düsseldorf. While I am from Düsseldorf, I can understand a bit of the dialect but the Cologne dialect is damn hard to understand. Especially spoken.

So while I can hear that somebody is from Austria (since they will have a slight accent) I can understand them perfectly. But the dialect is impossible to understand as somebody who was growing up in a west German city.

Je ne connais pas le SAT et j'aurai du mal à répondre précisément à la question d'origine, mais en France, le Bac reste très important.

Polymestor présente certaines des alternatives qui existent au baccalauréat pour commencer des études universitaires sans ce diplôme roi.

Toutefois, en France, on aura tendance à accorder beaucoup d'importance aux diplômes de manière générale dans la vie professionnelle. Dans certaines grosses entreprises françaises, accéder à de hautes fonctions de management peut être virtuellement impossible si l'on ne fait pas partie des diplômés d'un petit groupe d'écoles.

As for Egypt, Sadat wanted to flip over to the US camp. We didn't engineer Egypt's crossover to the West: Egypt did. The Yom Kippur War was fought to give Sadat the cover to accept a peace with Israel in exchange for American cash.

The details of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are irrelevant. It's not really important to American leaders whether Palestine is recognized as a state at the UN.

In Portugal if you are not a bright student, all you can do is work at a factory or doing manual unqualified labor. I went to school till the 7th grade in Portugal, all if my former school mates that were bad at studying are now working at stores, restaurants or factories. You have no chance to be someone if you suck at school.

In Switzerland at the 6th grade you have a series of tests that put you into one of the various school levels, each level is made for a particular group of students and you can choose different apprenticeships according to your level. The highest one is the Bezirksschule, if someone is at that level, they can either continue studying until they go the university or they can chose an apprenticeship.

If you chose to take an apprenticeship, you have to send your Curriculum to different companies, after taking a test and working there for a couple of days you are then chosen for it. There is an apprenticeship for almost every job imaginable, you work at your company and go to school once a week. This all happens at the age of 16-20. 

After 3-4 years taking the apprenticeship and working in your trade, you take a final exam and receive a diploma. The kids that don't want to take an apprenticeship have a very hard time searching for a job, but these kids are mostly lazy since EVERYONE has the chance to take an apprenticeship.

During those 3-4 years you receive a salary that goes from 800 Swiss francs at the beginning to about 1500 in the final year. After completing your apprenticeship you start with a nice salary of about 4500 (at least in my trade), this depends from the job. You can then do the Berufsmatura for taking higher courses, you can eventually the same level as a graduate if you keep doing these courses, these are normally paid by your company.

The system in Portugal doesn't give everyone a chance, they give a chance for you to take a worthless degree, that's why we have to many graduates that are jobless or working at shitty jobs even though they have a diploma. What good is this ""everyone can be a doctor!""

true,[deleted],null,null,"Very good, on a general note, the educated and relatively wealthy classes stop pushing stuff on blue-collars that worked well for themselves but may not work so well for them.

Internationalism, becoming a cosmopolite works well enough for us, because we can just skim the cream off the top of multiple cultures.

But the low-brow, low-educated, blue-collar version of internationalism and cosmopolitianism is basically MTV with McDonalds. In other words, crap. Almost every folk tradition is better than that. Worst thing? Low-brow cosmopolitan pop culture is not even European, we mostly import it from America. So when low-brow people stop being national, they also stop being European. 

This is nothing new. We the educated found sexual liberation is good for us, because we can have sex responsibly. We pushed it on the working class, and the result was boys growing up without a stable father role model. We found atheism is good for us, because we can learn science and philosophy, we pushed it on the working class, and the result was astrology-type superstition and the destruction of communities that were centered around a local church. 

Perhaps it sounds hopelessly conservative but what if we would leave the working class the heck alone and let them live the way they want to live?

I am usually quite pro-capitalist, but this is where I draw the line. If corporations have so much power that they can require that people give up their hometown, their community, friends, relatives,  their _life_ and move somewhere else, become uprooted, and have no life other than their nuclear family (if they have any at all) just to get a lousy job, it means they have too much power.

No. Everyone has problems, the loss to society is just higher when it happens to their top potential. In addition, the high potential people are just as much out of sync with the rest of society as the low potential people. You could justify giving them the same attention, but giving them less is just spiteful.

People migrating to the towns saw that liberal jobs (lawyers, doctors) were dominated by minorities, especially Jews, and this created resentment. Sure, they did start to assimilate (so much so that at one point Jews, who spoke either Hungarian or Yiddish were referred to as Hungarians or Germans of Jewish faith). But still a lot of people felt that Jews were not really Hungarian-Hungarians, and coupled with economic grievances, it burst out as anti-semitism.

The same was true in Romania, in the interbelum. Cities in Transylvania were dominated by Hungarians, Germans and Jews (most became majority Romanian only in the 60s and 70s). Cities in northern Moldova also had large Jewish populations, as well as the capital, Bucharest. A century earlier, anti-Greek sentiment was strong in Moldova and Wallachia, in a similar way.

Simillar to how Jews dominated certain profesions (trade, law, medicine), the Chinese dominate in Southeast Asia and Indians in some former British colonies (like Fiji, and untill Idi Amin kicked them out, Uganda).

Other students tell me that they can hear my Bavarian shining through, but it's very subtle. 

(I'm not sure whether that's also part of this whole dialect thing, but some words can be confusing, I never quite know whether and where to call rolls Semmeln, Brötchen or Schrippen.)",0,1354101306,null,0,false,0,c7807h4,t3_13vu13,t1_c7807h4,t1_c77r6h3,null,1430521547,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

The World isn't orderly and a system you just move through.  After school you're dumped on the pavement and if you don't get on your feet and moving quickly you simply get passed by.  The World very much is a place of 'FuckYou' at rush hour.  You're not in the rat race yet so of course you think the whole system is ludicrous.  It is ludicrous.  The thing is us rats like it that way.  It's like when you were a kid and you thought girls/boys were yucky: it's only when you've jumped in one that they start to grow on you.

At the moment it's like walking through a field making daisy chains as you peruse what might be a fair system (and I believe the support on the subreddit is because you're very much not alone and Reddit itself is very much a daisy field people retreat to outside the real world - I know I do).  Life isn't a daisy chain of what is fair though, in the World of FuckYou the question is *'How do I get any representative that will best represent me?*  My street, my town, my concerns.  Not the other guy's concerns, so if the jobs and the investment is going to go anywhere it affects me and not the next county, the next guy.  In the next county the man is thinking the exact same thing about himself.  His street, his town, his concerns.  Nobody takes it personally, but if you don't participate then you cease to be a competitor.  Everybody in the World of FuckYou understands that peers are of your own making and there isn't an assumption of authority that can't be changed.  The person who runs with the biggest gang gets to make the rules.

That's why people voted for FPTP.  

If Nick Clegg had been a silvery tongued devil and if the Daily Mail had never run a piece on it, it wouldn't have changed a thing.  FPTP means that if you want to put anybody into parliament you play by the normal rules of World FuckYou and convince more voters than the other guy that you're right.  That's it.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I think it's a mix of domestic nationalist reasons, leftovers from the former Soviet superpower status, and some very real regional and geopolitics.

In terms of global influence, they have gone from being one of only two undisputed global superpowers to being reduced to emerging power status in a very short time, and they're hanging on to what's left. They're still one of only two powers that have the power to wipe out human civilization on a moment's notice, and according to traditional thinking this deserves some respect that they don't get anymore because, somehow, the rest of the world has collectively decided to simply ignore this fact. Foreign policy aside, this would have caused domestic issues anywhere.

In regards to regional and geopolitics, other powers are chipping away at their sphere of influence. For example, the countries around the Caspian Sea (read: gigantic natural gas reserves) used to be under Soviet or under Soviet influence. This used to be undisputed. But nowadays they have the option to look towards China or the West. Even just where pipelines pass through is of geopolitical relevance. Do they pass through Russian territory, or not? Circumventing Russia means loss of influence.   
Or look at the NATO expansion into Eastern Europe. That's a slap in the face. Or take the missile shield. No, it's not effective enough to prevent a Russian first strike, because that would just be too overwhelming, but it would have a significant effect on a second strike after much of their capabilities would have been wiped out by a potential American first strike.

Ich glaube, dass die Krise des Journalismus (wenn es denn nicht nur eine Printkrise ist) gar nicht so sehr darin liegt, dass Journalismus zu konsumieren im Internet nichts kostet. Schließlich war es schon immer so, dass ein Großteil der Einnahmen aus Journalismus eigentlich aus der Werbung stammt und nicht aus dem Kiosk.

Für Printwerbung wird von Anzeigenkunden aber viel mehr Geld gezahlt als für Internetwerbung. Journalismus wird im Internet nicht gerade gut bezahlt. Auch qualitativ hochwertige Angebote sind nicht besonders lukrativ. Ich glaube zB nicht, dass Stefan Niggemeier mit seinem Blog ein besonders luxuriöses Leben finanzieren könnte. Und auch die großen Nachrichtenseiten sind ja nicht dafür bekannt, Goldesel der Verlagshäuser zu sein.

In der Printwerbung steckt ne Menge Kohle, in der Internetwerbung im Vergleich ganz schön wenig. Oder anders gesagt: Internetwerbung funktioniert nur bei Aggregatoren richtig gut, weniger bei einzelnen Angeboten. Das liegt (vermute ich) daran, dass die Internetnutzung vorwiegend über Aggregatoren läuft, während man bei Print eher loyal zu einer Zeitung (oder ein paar) ist. Außerdem hat man mit der Auflage/Abonnementzahlen ganz verlässliche und bewährte Reichweitenzahlen, die verlässliche Kosten/Nutzen-Kalkulationen von Werbung ermöglichen.

Langfristig können nur Aggregatoren und einige wenige hoch frequentierte Angebote von Onlinejournalismus leben, wenn die Werbeeinnahmen so niedrig sind.

japan is said to borrow from its people rather than taxing them.

the tax rate is very low, but the saving rate is enormous and there is an aging population, so the investment/pension funds then lend to the government on extremely low interest rates to fund the ongoing government deficit.

if the government chose, and the people accepted, the tax rate could be raised to 'normal' western levels around 40% of GDP and immediately return the nations finances to primary surplus.

the people are unlikely to accept this without an economic crisis however, as everyone is intimately aware of the aging crisis, and anyway, by having a captive domestic audience for government borrowing japan remains largely immune from a sovereign-debt crisis sparked by crippling interest rates demanded by overseas investors.

it is a very different economic world from europe, where taxation is high and deficit funding is at the mercy of overseas investors due to appallingly low domestic rates of saving.

true,ChemicalPleasure,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; Fucking an animal is animal abuse.

If that is the accepted view on bestiality then there is no requirement for a new law because laws against animal abuse already exist.

&gt; So you, like Mr. Kiok, think an animal can express consent?

I never said that and I don't appreciate being grouped with zoophiles simply because I oppose your childish views on such a subject. Childish because you imply a human would require consent from the animal, do we require consent before we slaughter an animal or when we wish to use it to carry loads or passengers? 

We slaughter animals for food and we use them for work and transportation and when they don't comply we force them. Now I personally don't think having sex with animals is particularly desirable but to say it goes beyond what we already do to animals is nonsense. To then imply that consent is required as it would be between humans is therefore irrational, you demand it because people having sex with animals disgusts you. To forbid others to do it who are not so disgusted by it (or in fact enjoy it) is therefore a moralistic imposition as I said before. The law as it is now seems fine to me, if the animal suffers it qualifies as animal abuse and it is illegal, if the animal does not suffer (as far as can be objectively established) no animal abuse has taken place, perhaps you find it disgusting (me too) but there are many things that I find disgusting that are not (and should not be) illegal.",0,1354118023,null,0,false,0,c7830t1,t3_13xjje,t1_c7830t1,t1_c782qoo,null,1430522996,19,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,19

On the plane, almost everything is fine - the staff is usually very nice, entertainment is pretty ok I guess and the seats are quite comfortable. But don't be surprised when you're a vegetarian and they run out of the vegetarian meals. Happens.

But what really freaks me out about flying with airberlin again, and I would only do it again when there's a real deal, is the fact that they had the worst organization of all. In Berlin, my flight got cancelled - I'm not mad about that at all, though we were sitting 2 hrs in the plane before they told us so - who knows what would've happened if we flew, but the organization afterwards was a mess. I know it's not the daily routine to get a hotel for 200 people or so, but we had to wait in lines for hours. Honestly, I waited three hours in line to find out where I have to stay for the night (since I'm not from Berlin) and the next morning we had to wait two hours again. We recognized our line by its length: ""where do we have to go now?"" - ""look, over there's a huge line with pretty angry looking people, that must be ours"" There were people seriously moving their households on this plane and they had to carry around their whole luggage and watch their children. 

Also, but I don't know if that's an airport thing (though I don't think so): they can't organize your boarding.

true,everythingisnew,GERM,Germany,"&gt;Killing and eating an animal does not necessarily include unnecessary suffering or torture as far as I know.

The data clearly shows (i can dig up a study if your intersted) that factory farming is the main way for global lifestock ""production"". But let us, for the sake of argument, consider the ideal farm ,or better yet, wild animals that are hunted. So, let us assume the wild animal was able to roam freely in the natural way. Lets also say that it has no family which could suffer from the loss of their kin. At this point one could decide for themself that he thinks that it is morally acceptable to kill. The thought experiment still remains interesting! As we have just constructed the ""most ethical way"" of killing an non human animal for means of consumption, we can go ahead and do the same for the bestiallity issue. Before i go ahead with that please let me reiterate that i am by no means advocating beastiality but mearly exploring the moral parrallels between that and consumption of non human animal products! 

Say the animal communicates its consent to the act of bestiallity in a way that is unmistakeably. To make this picture  easier one could think of maybe a chimpanzee or even better a bonobo which both have shown remarkable abillities to communicate and are phisically very simillar to humans. So what you end up with is the question if it is more/equally/less ethical to kill a non human animal in a ""humane"" way and thereby causing in the best case no suffering (not what actually happens to the millions of factory farmed non human animals killed every day) compared to the before constructed scenario of a sexual act with a non human animal which could be argued to cause no harm or may even be enjoyed by both participants.


Legally all of this is of course very tough. How would you show that the animal consented? But that is not the point of my expicitly theoretical thought experiment. As you can probably guess by now, i don't think that animal product consumption fits the description of beeing moral. 


&gt;So I don't really think either of your situations is very well accepted in modern society.


I have to disagree. Go in *any* supermarket and buy the meat they sell there and i challenge you to show me how to raise an animal in a way that is even close to their natural habitat and causing no suffering for the equivallent of the money you just spend. The overwhelming majority of lifestock is raised in absolutely horrendous conditions and *everybody* who buys those products is contributing to the continuation of the suffering. I would therefore argue that this way of organized suffering is very well accepted. No one would of course publicly state that it is ok to let animals suffer but at the same time most people will just allow themself to stay ignorant of the realities that go with the issue. 


Going back to my original thought experiment and putting it in a more blunt tl,dr way: Why do people care if other people let their dogs fuck them while they themself go and buy the 1€ sausage which is made from an animal that is arguably just as intelligent and able to feel pain as the dog is. 


Addendum:

Appart from politics, laws and all the BS in the media it all boils down to your personal decision:

You think beastiallity is amoral? Don't do it.

You think killing a fellow sentient beeing for consumption is amoral? Don't do it.

That maybe true if the only way to live healthy would be to consume animal products which is shown to not be the case. If you are interested in that I can provide peer reviewed papers to prove that point. Killing an animal only because you enjoy the taste could actually be argued to be pretty simillar to your ""stomping on stray cats' heads for pleasure"" example. Of course most people will not think of it that way. The ignorance of most people about the realities of meat ""production"" is unfortunate but has to be considered in their defense.

Well, personally, I would consider myself largely anthropocentric. Humane killing for a larger variety of pleasurable foods is acceptable to me. Killing for the pleasure of killing is not. Again, it's mostly framed from the perspective of humans and their minds. I do not have a problem with humanely killing stray animals. Inhumane animal conditions are a worry for me more because of the quality of the food and the sustainability of our practices and less because of the animals' well-being. 

Then combine this with tradition and culture. My point of view is heavily based on these things, with what is acceptable and what is not. I think western society is gradually moving towards better treatment of animals, and I welcome that, but don't look to me to stop eating animals and their products.

And so back to banging sheep: the problem is that the human is crazy. I think even in the wild the animal many times does not consent to its mating partner, and the animal is usually not harmed by the randy Welshman, so the main problem lies in the human's head.

I'm sorry to tell you this but in my opinion and I'm not the only one who thinks this in Paris, padlocks on what used to be my favorite bridge (pont des arts) is painful to see, not only for the view, but also for the symbol that love could be reduced to a padlock : as if you were chained with your patner through the tightest link you could imagine while true love in my opinion is everything but that, it is fragile and efforts should be made to keep this link as tight as possible.

I don't think that's logical at all. Life may be hard in the post education part compared with the pre education part but that doesn't really have a lot to do with the logic of a voting system. A voting system should allow the party the electorate want to win. I think that AV does that better than FPTP.

Anyway, I don't really see what the point of your rant was. All it did was talk about how unfair life is and I kind of make me out to be an ignorant child who has experienced nothing of the world, which may or may not be true.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Plus they didn't had a luxury of being invited in EU and WTO. And considering that they've done a pretty good job recently especially if you compare them to Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Belarus...

Russian accession to WTO didn't happen earlier because Russian elites didn't want it. The same is true with the EU, Russian elites don't want it. And there is simple reason for this, if Russia would have opened its economy like other eastern European countries did, western companies would have in an instance taken over the whole economy.

&gt; UN should ensure their independence. For some reason Finland and Sweden are not scared about being occupied by anyone.

UN and what army? Finland and Sweden are both scared on being occupied and that is why they have modern armies. Finland has conscription army of 237 thousand, however there are weapons for easily half a million man. Ground forces also have adequate amounts of Leopard 2 battle tanks and other combat vehicles. Finnish air forces are equipped with F-18s and they just made an order to get air-to-ground missiles from US allow them to strike relatively deep inside Russian territory. Not to mention that for example Helsinki has a secret underground tunnel network to allow the army effectively fight any invasion to it.

We shouldn't also forget that there may or may not be secret pacts with other countries. For example I have heard that in the 90s when Finland was negotiating ordering new fighters, one American general said that for any fighter shot down, there would be a replacement fighter for free.

&gt; So your argument is that US can have a sphere of influence and Russia can't because US have a sphere of influence and Russia don't. Solid logic here...

Russia doesn't have the power. US is a super power, EU does have the economy to become a super power if it wants to, China will become a super power in next 50 years.

Yeah right, it's Russia's fault. And the fact that US still didn't normalized trade relations with Russia is also it's fault. Russia submitted it's bid to join WTO 19 years ago. If Russian elites didn't whant to enter they wouldn't bother asking for it.

&gt;We shouldn't also forget that there may or may not be secret pacts with other countries.

So why US couldn't sign same pacts with Baltic states without expanding NATO's borders?

&gt;Russia doesn't have the power. US is a super power, EU does have the economy to become a super power if it wants to, China will become a super power in next 50 years. The fact of the matter is that Russia doesn't have any resources to compete against these behemoths.

You're mad  if you think that Russia doesn't have military power. Russia is still number two military power in the world. It currently has a third largest military budget, but they have inherited so much military equipment from the soviet union that it will take decades for China to catch up. And to say that Russia doesn't have resources is pretty ridiculous considering that Russia has a largest reserves of pretty much any natural resources in the world.

Bilder sind immer was tolles. Als Frau von der Leyen das Internet verbieten wollte, hat sie den Journalisten auch ganz schreckliche Bilder gezeigt. Kipo wird entweder genauso oder sogar schwerer bestraft als der wiederholte Mißbrauch von Kindern. Wegen der schrecklichen Bilder, die man vor Gericht präsentieren kann. Bilder sind einfach eindrücklich. Die Beschneidungsgegner sollten auch mal endlich Bilder von blutverschmierten Babys auspacken. Dann haben wir ganz schnell wieder ein Judenprogrom, dass es sich gewaschen hat. 

Es geht einfach nichts über Bilder.

Edit: Es kommt sogar noch besser, ich hatte den Artikel gar nicht zuende gelesen.

&gt; Es seien ""böse E-Mails"" von Kiok an Siemers geschickt worden, es gab eine Demonstration vor seinem Wohnhaus, Bilder zu Tode gequälter Hunde wurden hochgehalten, Nachbarn informiert.

Eine Demo vor dem Haus und Nachbarn informiert wegen ein paar Hunden? Werden jetzt demnächst die Bauern von Mastbetrieben verfolgt? Und Ledergeschäfte in Brand gesetzt? Ach nee, die sind intelligent genug keine Fotos von unapptetilichen Vorgängen zu machen. Oder wie war das mit Wiesenhof? Die Leute haben echt nichts besseres zu tun als ihre Mitmenschen fertig zu machen, wenn die irgendwie anders sind. Denn Wiesenhof-Geflügel wollen wir schließlich alle essen.

true,mrh112,EURO,European Union,"I don't personally believe calling euroscepticism ""a virus"" is civilized or respectful coming from a potential ""president"" of Europe, maybe if you considered the points they were making and counteracted them you would get more respect, its like calling anyone who does not share the same beliefs of you a virus, would you call a Muslim or Jew a virus for not being a christian or atheist?

The reason most people are eurosceptic like myself is that we see the EU as a large, inefficient, bureaucratic monster. If the EU was reformed with a legal constitution limiting it to a trading, research and defense pact we would have no problem, its the undemocratic federal system its sprouting that's the problem most eurosceptics do not like.

Firstly the EU needs to be massively reformed to make it entirely democratic to national governments and the population, this can start by making the European Parliament a hall appointed by proportional representation with the number of seats available based on economic importance not population count per nation (a far more 21st century outlook on politics). 

Secondly the so called ""commission"" what I like to call the executive cabinet can be made democratic by having a prime minister appointed by the European parliament to then appoint a cabinet on advice of the European Leaders (simply the leaders of the 27 nations in the union)

Thirdly abolish the European council which simply allows national governments to issue their own agendas on an European level, likewise remove the power for national leaders to vote on legislation in the ""upper house"" of the CEU, instead replace this with the current representative based regional MEP system.

After this reform the legislative arm of the EU will be entirely independent from national leaders, instead we will have a democratic lower house appointed by PR based on economic might and an upper house of regional MEPs for democratic scrutiny in our local areas and nations, this would stop national politics getting in the way of dictating in European problems.

Lastly the President of the EU is unnecessary, instead the appointed prime minister of the EU would be the final authority of the EU, why have another individual to represent the EU for PR sake? its costly and wholly unwanted by many Europeans, instead we should just appoint the Prime minister as both head of government and state. 

And believe me, this man (Tony Blair) has one of the lowest levels of popularity in British political history, if he was to become EU president I can assure you eurosceptics would increse from 52% to 80% of the electorate overnight in the UK.",0,1354134439,null,0,false,0,c7881n9,t3_13xvix,t1_c7881n9,t3_13xvix,null,1430525381,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Good call! Yes, [free movement of labor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_for_workers) is one of the pillars of the Single Market. So, EU citizens have the right to work in any other EU country.  
This has been in place since before the UK even joined the EEC, but there's no reason to mention that. You could look into Polish immigration, you'll find the figures on the [Eurostat](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database) website. If you choose the right time frame, you can do magical things. Have a look [here](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=migr_pop1ctz&amp;lang=en). In 2005, there have been 109,994 Polish citizens in the UK, in 2010 there already were 538,093. Over those five years, this constitutes an average growth of 37.37% per year. If you extrapolate from there, you can demonstrate how by 2020, there will be 13 million Poles in the UK, and by 2030 this figure will have grown to a staggering 308 million (about equal to the population of the US). I'm sure you'll agree that this is a shocking development that poses a very real threat to the UK's national identity.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Yeah right, it's Russia's fault. And the fact that US still didn't normalized trade relations with Russia is also it's fault. Russia submitted it's bid to join WTO 19 years ago. If Russian elites didn't whant to enter they wouldn't bother asking for it.

It is. To become a WTO member you have to make quite a big changes on how your own internal markets work, and how you treat your external trade. The fact is that Russia didn't want to make these changes, and thus negotiations were stuck for ages. The reason why Russia finally made necessary changes was due to both China becoming a WTO member and the EU pooling their trade relations together.

&gt; So why US couldn't sign same pacts with Baltic states without expanding NATO's borders?

Secret pacts are worse than making a public pact. The reason why Finland and Sweden haven't jointed the NATO, especially why Finland hasn't joined it, is because it is seen better to wait formation of the EU army that will take over common defence, maybe form a European part of the NATO.

&gt; You're mad if you think that Russia doesn't have military power. Russia is still number two military power in the world. It currently has a third largest military budget, but they have inherited so much military equipment from the soviet union that it will take decades for China to catch up. And to say that Russia doesn't have resources is pretty ridiculous considering that Russia has a largest reserves of pretty much any natural resources in the world. 

Military power comes from economic power. You need money to develop and manufacture all needed equipment, to train men and keep everything up to date. Just take a look to GDP nominal...

* European Union, 17.6 trillion US dollars
* United States, 15.0 trillion
* China, 7.2 trillion
* Japan, 5.8 trillion
* Brazil, 2.4 trillion
* Russia, 1.8 trillion

The more you are able to produce, the more you money to put on your armed forces. This is the reason why US can afford to have 11 super, and the reason why Soviet Union couldn't have any. Money equals powers. In the 21th-century the centres of world will be US, China and Europe, other potential power centre will be India if they are able to keep their current growth trajectory up.

The thing about Russia and its economy is that even if the country would have the same GDP per capita as United States, it still wouldn't have even half the size of economy that the US has, that is just a fact of population count. Another thing is that Russian economy is based on commodities that are quickly loosing their value due to both new technology and new ways to produce materials. For example US is fast becoming self-sufficient in oil and gas, Europe too is becoming more energy diverse and with technology such as fracking becoming more developed, it can also become more energy independent.

In case of Russian equipment inherited from the Soviet Union, most of it is obsoleted. In the first gulf war US forces overran Iraqi forces that were mostly equipped with Soviet equipment. The same is true with nuclear forces, you need active upkeep and research to make sure that your nuclear weapons and missiles actually work. French and Brits can hardly upkeep their nuclear arsenal, and they have much bigger economies than Russia.

Except what you said is not a fact, but rather an opinion. And an opinion directly contradicted by the available evidence, at that. Special programs have definitely shown that they can drastically improve the functionality of challenged children.

&gt; I used the expression of the comment I responded to to indicate the people with the most intellectual talent.

When you appropriate a term you have to be responsible for it. How would **you** identify these children, then? Please say it's not IQ, because by now it's painfully obvious that IQ doesn't correlate very well (or linearly at all) with overall success in life, happiness, or some measured form of contribution to society, real or perceived.

&gt; No. Everyone has problems, the loss to society is just higher when it happens to their top potential.

a) [citation needed] (as I said, IQ is not a predictor of future contribution to society), and b) you were advocating for special **education** programs, not psychiatric prophylactic ones. Make up your mind (or stop arguing for the sake of argument, whatever your reason for being so inconsistent is).

&gt; In addition, the high potential people are just as much out of sync with the rest of society as the low potential people.

Again, I think this will need a citation. I don't believe it's true at all. 

&gt; You could justify giving them the same attention, but giving them less is just spiteful.

It's not when, to my knowledge (and again, please correct me if I'm wrong; while I've done some research on the matter it's definitely not my field), there isn't a lot of evidence that investing in special education for the top percentiles of IQ results in any kind of measurable benefits for society (and perhaps not even to the individuals).

&gt; So can less gifted ones.

No, less gifted ones are definitely, and statistically measurably worse off without special help.

&gt;  In the first case society loses more though.

as for the sensible argument, I'm sorry, I'm a bit low on wall-of-text-writing fuel right now, but the general idea would be: economic poles are shaping up in the world, with China and Brazil and India moving up, and no state in Europe will be an industrial powerhouse by itself.

I know but when the majority of the British public are demanding a referendum and the now-PM gave a cast Iron guarantee for a referendum I feel like we are being ignored. Granted this may not be the best time to have it as the EU is not stable but how long will it be till it IS the right time. I dont think it will be the right time for a long time and we can't always wait for the EU to recover before deciding. Also I think from everything being said by Borroso points to federalisation.

And I'm not talking about cost of the metro rides.  We stayed in a hotel right on the river near the Pont Neuf and it was great.  *Very* short commute to almost every major attraction.  The hotel wasn't cheap, but it wasn't outrageous either.  But I know that you can find apartments near that same area for around $100 USD per night.  If you can afford to stay inside the city it's totally worth it for the experience.  And you can save a little on food too if you want.  We were usually able to run back to the hotel in the middle of the day for lunch to cook, same for breakfast.  The markets are open pretty late so we'd take a short walk down to the closest market a couple times a week before we went to bed.

Also, when we got to where we were going and realized we forgot our wallet or camera or whatever, it would generally take 15-25 minutes at most to run back to the hotel and come back.

However, if you are really strapped on cash to the point where spending an extra $50 or so a night on a hotel in the city would mean not getting to go do all the things you want to do, then definitely consider staying outside the city.  If not, then don't skimp on the experience that staying in the middle of a beautiful city like Paris offers.",0,1354141586,null,0,false,0,c78adag,t3_13xve8,t1_c78adag,t1_c785jt5,null,1430526481,2,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,2
