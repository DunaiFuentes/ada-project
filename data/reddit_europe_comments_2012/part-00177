true,ChemicalPleasure,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; Have you ever in your life played amateur football, or seen what ethnicity the hooligans at professional football?
I guess not.

Actually yes, for about 15 years now. In Rotterdam no less so I have seen *exactly* where the prejudice against Moroccans comes from. I have played against teams of only ""white farmers"" without incident; exclusively Turks, again without incident and teams that had one or more Moroccan players, often *with incidents*. The players are pricks, the fathers beside the field are pricks too. One of the reasons you could tell this teams apart as ""allochtoon"" is the randomness and the level of violence, always it's the fights with the Moroccan kids that go way too far, most fights between these ""white farmers"" you describe end after one or two swings and a few curse words, I have yet to see one of them kick someone in the face when they're already down, that requires a special level of depravity. 

&gt; So what exactly are people not publicizing here? Newspapers need to report the relevant facts, and anyone who has spend time in their youth at the field knows that immigrants really are not the exception when it comes to violence.

They publish *yet another* incident of extreme behavior by these Moroccan kids. Had they been Surinamese or Chinese I doubt it would have been reported. People are just sick of this crap.",0,1355321752,null,0,false,0,c7fdnlv,t3_14nvf0,t1_c7fdnlv,t1_c7fdbx0,null,1430652514,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I was using that as ends of a scale, hence my use of quotes. However currently racism is strongly correlated with ""right wing"" political groups.

That statement, in the history of race relations, was a massively radical view. Go back 50 or 100 years, and the things people could say in polite company are *far* more racist than that view. Even on the history of 20th century, that is not the middle ground, that's far to the ""racism is bad"" side of the equation. It is *now* middle ground, because society has moved on.

And that reality is that even the best recycling programs available at the moment manage at the max a 80 - 90 % recycling rate. That means that 10 - 15% will still have to be disposed of in some other way. 

And that means (given todays technology) burning it or a landfill. There is no other option. 

Italians produced about [500 kg of trash per year / person](http://www.nationmaster.com/country/it-italy/env-environment) in 2000 (i doubt it got significantly less). So even if we apply the 85 % top rate that leaves 75 kg. of trash per person per year (in reality as shown above its about 300 kg). Which means that a city like Parma would still produce 14.000 tons of trash per year which is not going to be recycled. (In reality its more like 56.000 tons)  

So question : Where do you put that. 

And if you say ""Well we simply have to recycel 100 % - Sure i agree. But its not gonna happen soon. And in italy with its 35 % recycling rate (on average) even the 80 % are not going to happen soon.

IIRC some Uni's have fees for foreign students, but none for Germans/Citizens of the EU. The only 'downside' that you might come across is the cost of living... but I'm not sure how it compares to AUS. I understand that things are generally more expensive in AUS (compared to the US, where I am from), so you may not actually see much of a difference between the cost of living in the EU vs. AUS, even with the exchange rate. 

Anyway, food, entertainment, travel, etc. can get pricey if you don't budget well and look for deals. You can also get by spending surprisingly little and still have a great time. I traveled alot while I was studying there, so that made up quite a bit of my expenses. I spent more on beer than I did anything else. Not because it's expensive... It's just sooo much better there. If you can find a school that has student housing, it will possibly be cheaper than having to find a place to live off campus (this, of course, varies from city to city). If nothing else, you could try to get into student housing for the first year and look for a cheaper place to rent while you are there. Students do get many perks though, as others have mentioned, so I believe that the benefits for students in Germany outweigh the costs in most cases. 

I studied in Germany two years ago. It was a great experience and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. You won't be alone either. There were Aussies everywhere haha.  ",0,1355325008,null,0,1355325248,0,c7feboj,t3_14q2ch,t1_c7feboj,t3_14q2ch,null,1430653112,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

After school and the at that time not obligatory military I first did an apprenticeship before studying before I wanted to study. But then I was so sick of learning for over 15 years (13 years of school and 2,5 years apprenticeship) that I didn't want to study anymore and started working. After another ~4,5 years I decided that now I want to learn something new and started university at the age of 26, almost 27.

I got full BAFöG for all 5 years (3 Bachelor, 2 Master). After living for 7 years independent from my parents I even got ""elternunabhängiges BAFöG"" where you get it no matter what your parents earn. And with BAFöG you don't have to pay everything back. And this was not so long ago, during the time where the university hat the additional 500,- Studiengebühren, where you also get a credit for, no questions asked. And the usually not more than 10.000,- € you have to pay back is really nothing compared to what you got.

Of course you have some dept afterwords. But you get a lot more than you have to pay back.

The system may not be perfect but I think it is better than most people claim it is. And all the bullshit people usually tell that they can't study is not true. Most are just too lazy or uninformed. Of course I couldn't keep my lifestyle as with a well payed job. I sold my car, moved from my own big flat in with 3 roommates so I could easily live off the money I got without working additionally. But it was a good decision to do this but you have to take a little risk and make some sacrifices. But it is really easy to study in Germany if you really want to.

One general tip I have for you is that Paris might be a little ""dead"" during your visiting period. Most French leave for holiday and the French don't tend to celebrate holidays like North Americans.

Café Cambronne at the corner outside Métro Cambronne. It's typical bistro fair but the portions are hearty and the waiters are sweet. I used to eat there every week! Around lunch it's for 10-15, and dinner is about 15-25. If you two are meat eaters, there's a plate on there which is basically a huge slab of beef. The name eludes me but it's 50 euros and can feed 3 comfortably (or two guys very well). I take all my visiting friends and family there and it turns out to be their favorite place to eat. 

Go to Angelina's for Hot Chocolate. Such a winter drink! It's about 10 euros for one pot but you and your friend can share because it's such a sugar rush. It's for the experience. The richest and thickest hot chocolate you probably will ever dream. 

The Eiffel Tower sparkles on the hour every night so that's a sight not to be missed. Speaking of, If you're staying around for New Years, whatever you do - DON'T go to the Eiffel Tower. I did that last year and there wasn't a unified countdown or fireworks. It was lackluster. Try the Champs Eylsees or a club. (Or take a trip to Edinburgh for their celebration ""Hogamany"" - it's the craziest all throughout Europe)

Research the type of metro tickets you want to buy! Think about getting a visitor's card too since you'll be there for more than a week try ratp.fr

Bateau mouche on your first day to take a boat ride along the Seine and see the big landmarks. (At night might be bitterly cold, but you're Canadian so... )

If you go to the Christmas Market on the Champs Elysees.. Eat [""tartiflette""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartiflette). It's my favorite winter dish and my stomach is just growling thinking about it. The vin chaud is heart warming as well. 

If it's a clear day, for an epic view of Paris - head to the very top of the shopping building ""Galeries Lafayette"" near Opéra. It's free but bundle up because you're on the rooftop! - And while you're there go to the nearby Opéra Garniers.. If you know of the story of the Phantom of the Opera then you'll love it. And even if you don't know - the interior itself is just jaw dropping. 

Try looking at groupon.fr right now if you want to snag on any deals. I lovedddd using that site.

... There's more I can share, but just specify with the topics you're interested in: nightlife, history, more food, general tips, etc.

Oui et c'est ce que Google n'a pas fait à l'époque. Il n'y avait pas de comptes Google. Toutes les sociétés essayaient de faire des ""portails"" génériques sur lesquels on pourrait mettre des pubs et où il fallait créer un compte. Google non. Pouvoir créer un compte sur Google n'est apparu qu'en 2004 !

Et oui, il était ""évident"" que la pub rapporteraient. Mais sous quelle forme, en quelle quantité et avec quelle infrastructure ? Là c'était nettement moins évident. La bulle internet, c'est justement ça : tout le monde pensait qu'il serait évident de faire de l'argent mais ça s'est révélé moins évident que prévu.

""N'importe quoi : tout le monde disait depuis longtemps qu'Apple allait se rémunérer principalement à partir des commissions sur les applications.""

Raté. Le premier App Store est apparu en 2008. Le premier Iphone (en 2007) n'avait pas d'App Store. Toutes les analyses, y compris à Apple, s'accordent sur le fait que personne n'avait réellement prévu le marché des applications.

""Là encore, si l'on oublie le rhétorique ""virtuellement illimité"", Google n'était pas le premier.""

Non, en effet. Mais le premier a réellement modifier l'interface, oui. Avant Gmail, un webmail était une solution de rechange lorsqu'un véritable client n'était pas disponible. GMail a été la toute première solution a revoir en profondeur la manière dont on interagissait avec nos mails. Expemple simple : le fil de conversation, concept complètement innovant à l'époque.

Et le virtuellement illimité n'est pas un détail. C'est ce qui a permis le concept d'archivage à une époque ou un webmail normal fournissait 100Mo d'espace. Cela a complètement chamboulé le rapport que les gens avaient avec leur boîte email. Archivage, fils de discussion, espace illimté : cela fait beaucoup d'innovations à la fois et le tout dans le browser.

If you're interested specifically in these two:


&gt; **Iceland**

&gt; 

&gt; 25.

&gt; The Council welcomes the good progress made in the accession negotiations over the past
year and notes that the pace of the negotiations continues to reflect Iceland's advanced state of
alignment resulting from the European Economic Area (EEA) and Schengen membership,
and the quality of its public administration. The Council notes that the negotiations are now
entering a more decisive phase. Furthermore, the areas of mutual interest between the EU and
Iceland are growing, including in the fields of renewable energy and climate change, and in
view of the strategic importance of the EU's Arctic policy.

&gt; 26.

&gt; The Council believes that Iceland's accession is a matter of mutual benefit and is committed
to moving the negotiating process forward in line with the requirements of the Negotiating
Framework, including the fulfilment of Iceland’s obligations under the EEA Agreement,
taking full account, inter alia, of the European Council conclusions of 17 June 2010. The
Council recalls that the accession negotiations will be aimed at Iceland integrally adopting the
EU acquis and ensuring its full implementation and enforcement by accession, duly reflecting
Iceland's own merits and the provisions of the Negotiating Framework.

&gt; 27.

&gt; The Council notes with satisfaction Iceland's economic recovery and improvements of its
macro-economic conditions. Iceland should be able to cope with competitive pressures and
market forces within the Union over the medium term, provided that it continues to address
current challenges through appropriate macroeconomic policies and structural reforms.

&gt; 28.

&gt; In line with the renewed consensus on enlargement, the Council welcomes the continuation of
communication activities promoting an informed public debate about Iceland's accession
process and integration with the EU.

&gt; 

&gt; **Montenegro**

&gt; 

&gt; 29.

&gt; The Council welcomes the launch of the accession negotiations with Montenegro on 29 June
2012 and the on-going process of screening of individual negotiating chapters in line with the
Negotiating Framework, as well as the integration into the negotiations of the new approach
for the chapters on judiciary and fundamental rights and justice, freedom and security. The
Council welcomes that both chapters are being addressed early in the negotiations. The
Council recalls that the advancement of the negotiations will be guided by Montenegro’s
progress in preparing for accession, including the fulfilment of its obligations under the
Stabilisation and Association Agreement, as well as Montenegro's progress in addressing
areas of weakness identified in the Commission's Opinion.

&gt; 30.

&gt; The Council positively notes the progress Montenegro has made in the past year, including to
strengthen the functioning of the parliament, the judiciary, anti-corruption policy, human
rights and the protection of rights of persons belonging to minorities. The Council notes that
ongoing constitutional and public administration reforms have advanced. Montenegro has
also continued to implement its obligations under the Stabilisation and Association
Agreement smoothly, and to play a constructive role in the region. The Council notes with
satisfaction Montenegro’s involvement in developing regional cooperation.

&gt; 31.

&gt; Montenegro is now required to build on the progress made. Particular attention should be
paid to further develop a solid track record in the area of rule of law with the aim of
sustainable and lasting reform implementation, in particular with regard to organised crime
and corruption cases, including at high level. The Council welcomes Europol's report on the
situation with regard to organised crime in Montenegro. Further efforts are also needed to
ensure the accountability and independence of the judiciary and to strengthen the
administrative capacity to implement the acquis.

&gt; The Council looks forward to the meeting of the Accession Conference on 18 December and
hopes that further progress can be registered on this occasion.

That is like saying F1 cars are death traps because of there small size and speed but F1 cars are incredibly safe . . and you know why?

Carbon Fiber Shell for the car which makes it very hard to cause a dent. 

And also an aluminum alloy chasis to protect the driver.

You could be hit form the side by a BMW going 60 MPH and you would survive the crash because the shell would absorb much of the hit and the aluminum chasis will secure your body and head.

Also the front of the car is a easy openable glass, so in case of a serious crash you can get out very very easily and not be trapped under the seat or something like in most car crashes you see.

[Nell'anno del Signore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFCdrC0gUgQ) (1969) di Luigi Magni

*Roma, 1825. Due carbonari, Leonida Montanari, romano, e Angelo Targhini, modenese, hanno accoltellato un loro adepto di famiglia nobile che minacciava di svelare i segreti della Carboneria e alla fine, dopo un processo sommario, sono ghigliottinati in Piazza del Popolo dal boia di allora Mastro Titta. ""Siete l'omo più moderno de Roma"" gli dirà ironicamente Montanari sul patibolo. La loro storia autentica va di pari passo con un'altra tutta di fantasia che propone, in chiave serio-faceta, le vicende sentimentali e politiche di un ciabattino da tutti ritenuto analfabeta e che si rivela invece essere Pasquino, autore di quelle satire anonime in cui si riassumeva da anni il malcontento del popolo romano. Nel film viene sottolineato l'atteggiamento della Santa Sede nei confronti delle comunità ebraiche e mostra come si istituisse il coprifuoco al fine di impedire rivolte.*

[Brutti, sporchi e cattivi [trailer]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=euSvcanedac#!) (1976) di Ettore Scola

*Periferia di Roma, primi anni settanta: la vita quotidiana di una famiglia (circa venticinque persone tra genitori, figli, consorti, amanti, nipoti e nonna) si svolge nella povertà di una baraccopoli. A capo di tutti c'è il vecchio Giacinto Mazzatella: di origine pugliese (di cui conserva il dialetto), guercio, dispotico e fedifrago, tratta familiari e vicini al pari delle bestie. Questi possiede un milione di lire, risarcimento dell'assicurazione per aver perso un occhio, ed è ossessionato dal fatto che i parenti glielo possano rubare, per cui lo nasconde continuamente in luoghi diversi e quando, a volte, si scorda dove lo ha messo, crede che gli sia stato rubato e tenta, senza mai riuscirci, di ammazzare il primo parente che gli capita sottomano.*

[L'imperatore di Roma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hQI39lBA14) (1987) di Nico D'Alessandria

*Ispirato ad Accattone di Pier Paolo Pasolini, L'imperatore di Roma descrive in bianco e nero alcune giornate-tipo di un tossicodipendente romano di nome Gerry dedito all'accattonaggio e all'uso di droghe. Attraverso estenuanti monologhi ed interminabili camminate, il film mostra la desolante esistenza di un uomo che ha ripudiato ogni schema ed ogni convenzione per vivere come uno dei tanti gatti che abitano i vecchi ruderi della Capitale.*

true,mielove,SWED,Sweden,"Is Canada still banning free travel from Romania because of this? The last I heard they were demanding VISA's for Romanian citizens due to a huge increase in asylum applications by Roma people. I remember it was a huge controversy and the EU proposed requiring VISA's from all Canadians visiting the EU in return...
  
Anyway, there's no simple solution to this issue. Obviously most are economic migrants rather than actual refugees. Though Roma people undoubtedly face a lot of prejudice that's not grounds for asylum unless we're talking state-mandated oppression which I'd hope does not occur in any EU country.   
  
Thing is that these type of fake asylum requests are quite common around the world. Canada must not be used to it being a more isolated country. Sweden gets heaps of asylum seekers from the most random countries (Russia, Azerbaijan, etc, not to mention the fake asylum seekers from countries where there actually IS some conflict [The Middle East, primarily]) and yes - they are a drain to the system. Problem is of course that the international law claiming every asylum seeker has the right to a trial exists for a reason. You can't always say people don't qualify for asylum due to their ethnicity or nationality - amongst every group there could be people who genuinely need asylum.  
  
So although the earlier Canadian proposal of freezing all Romanian nationals out because of this makes *economic* sense I really wouldn't say it's the right thing to do. The question of how to make the asylum system faster and more efficient is an age-old one but I think it's such an important one. We need better ways of weeding out the actual asylum seekers from the fake ones. :/",0,1355335604,null,0,1355335908,0,c7fh6hr,t3_14qdz8,t1_c7fh6hr,t3_14qdz8,null,1430654603,21,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,21

A lot of existing practices can be deemed problematic, just because it's legal doesn't mean it's right or fair.

*Verso la fine della seconda guerra mondiale, quattro potenti ""Signori"" nazifascisti aderenti alla Repubblica di Salò, ovvero un duca, un vescovo, un banchiere e un giudice, si ritirano per un soggiorno in una enorme e decadente villa isolata dal resto del mondo: fanno rapire e sequestrare un folto gruppo di giovani ragazzi, di entrambi i sessi, con l'intenzione di usarli per soddisfare tutte le loro perversioni sessuali. Con il passare dei giorni, le sevizie, gli abusi e le violenze, sia fisiche che psicologiche, aumentano gradualmente di intensità, fino all'esecuzione della condanna a morte per coloro che in precedenza hanno osato disobbedire agli ordini impartiti dai quattro ""Signori"".*

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt;  This poster is not very old. We do provide language courses and there is something called instegsjobb which is there to make it easier for specifically refugees to get jobs and to function in society. SD were against this because they thought it was discriminating to Swedes. We don't want assimilation, we want them to be a part of our society, whatever their religious beliefs, native language (as long as they learn our's) and customs is none of my business. Also we don't have free immigration, a majority of people who seek asylum are denied.

No offence but state provided or subsidized jobs worsen the problem, not fix it. If the economy needs engineers, business majors, doctors, lawyers, researchers, etc.. Then you need those people, not people without education. You also has to take into account that for almost any profession, you need a vocational degree which take 2-3 years time to study when you already have basic education. You only set immigrants to fail if you don't understand this.

&gt;  I think in most of the cultures in the world it is expected to get a job, as higher education isn't available for the majority of the people in some parts of the world. What cultural values are we talking about? Gender equality and individual freedom? Gender equality is still a problem in our current society. Men still go around and use sex-related insults. Women's salary are still lower than men's salary. There has been no PM in Sweden who has been a woman (however I think our current government has more female ministers than male ministers). SD who claim to be protecting women's rights from Muslims and immigrants in general are dominated by men.

There big differences between countries. You make it sound like that there is no difference between Saudi-Arabia and Sweden. In reality there is. In reality there are huge differences between cultures in case of individual freedom and gender equality. For crying out loud we didn't know term honour killing before there was immigration from middle-eastern countries that put much more emphasis on honour and family than individual centric western cultures.

&gt; Individual freedom as we see it today is also something relatively new to the West, especially gay rights. Also our individual freedom isn't something we can take granted for just because ""it's our culture"". New laws are every now and then trying to be passed regarding surveillance and wiretapping. Also you don't seem to be a big fan of individual freedom because you want everybody in Finland to become Finnish and to abandon their own culture in favor of your's.

You are very ignorant of your own cultural history. Nordic countries have always been very individualistic. This can very much be contributed to the fact that Nordics have been full of small independent farmers and for every new generation there has been wilderness to take and claim. This individualism was even more amplified by Storskiftet that divided village communities all over Sweden-Finland to small independent farms. Not to mention there has been long history of having a independent justice system where even peasants could have appealed to the king if they have felt that they have been wrongly judged. This is very unique in the world.

Not to mention that western civilization itself emphasises individuals that it inherited both from ancient Rome and how Christianity was applied into Roman context. 

Now if you don't believe me, please do familiarize yourself with [Hofstede cultural dimensions](http://geert-hofstede.com/countries.html). For example lets compare Finland and Pakistan in Hofstede dimensions...

* Power distance - Finland 33 vs. Pakistan 55 - Power distance is defined as the extent to which the less powerful members of institutions and organisations within a country expect and accept that power is distributed unequally.
* Individualism - Finland 63 vs. Pakistan 14 - The fundamental issue addressed by this dimension is the degree of interdependence a society maintains among its members. It has to do with whether people´s self-image is defined in terms of “I” or “We”.
* Masculinity / Femininity - Finland 26 vs. Pakistan 50 - The fundamental issue here is what motivates people, wanting to be the best (masculine) or liking what you do (feminine).
* Uncertainty avoidance  - Finland 59 vs. Pakistan 79 - The extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations and have created beliefs and institutions that try to avoid these is reflected in the UAI score.

So cultures are the same?

&gt; Or what? In the situation if I were to move to Finland would you kick me out if I reject becoming Finnish? Why are you telling me what to do and what to think? As long as I learn your language and live a normal life you can't do anything and you shouldn't want to do anything if you actually believe in individual freedom. 

You don't deserve citizenship with that attitude because you aren't Finnish.

&gt; If there is a sizable minority which requests the building to either be built, converted from any other type of building, or even a permit they should be denied because you want to ""preserve"" your culture? Denying a permit would be against freedom of religion. They are after all paying tax and they are likely to want to as much as possible collaborate. What about Finnish Jews? Jews have been in Europe for a very long time. Why can't you respect someone else's culture and heritage? Not everybody is as lucky as you who can practice it without being prosecuted.

Minorities can do what they want with their money, if they want to build their shrine, then that is their prerogative. However the Finnish state will expect that your children learn Finnish, they go to school that will instil state sanctioned values and beliefs that will make them able to function in the society and with good luck help them abandon ways that have no place in modern society.

And again, you can be Jew, Muslim or Christian, but if you are in Finland, then you better be Finnish, that is only thing that counts.

&gt;  I don't want to comment on your remark that you think Finnish culture is superior to many other ones. Finland has an excellent society but not definitely perfect with your condescending attitude to other cultures. Finland is rich, liberal, with good education and good health. Those are the reasons many other countries look up to Finland, not because of Moomin or your traditional foods. No other country is enforcing their way of life onto Finland, but with your attitude you are enforcing all non-Finns to become Finns regardless if they want it or not. Was there any infrastructure when Finland became independent? Cause if there was then that's one of the reasons Finland is successful. Also Finland didn't have to struggle with countless dictatorships after independence. Which seems to be a common denominator in Middle Eastern and African countries.

Finnic people have inhabited Finland for thousands of years, ever since the last ice age can Finnish track their lineage here. Ever since those times the people and their society have been under development. There was Finnish people and nation long before the independence.

What goes to economic development, when Finland became independent, it was one of the poorest nations in Europe, in less than 100 years the country has become one of the richest countries in the world. Under that time there has been one civil war, wars with USSR and Germans, and loose of big areas of country, and resettlement and rebuilding periods. This country isn't rich because it has natural richness, not because of infrastructure, but how its people form society and how they interact with each others. People make country rich.

And to remind you, nobody forces people to come Finland. This is our country, this is our way of life, if you want to become Finnish and work for it, then there are opportunities for that, but you are not welcomed here permanently if you don't want to become part of us.

&gt; That should be their choice to assimilate or not. And if were to be grown up here and your parents would actually try then you'd have two native languages. In Sweden we would have supported you to be Finnish if that is what you would want by giving you the privilege to study Finnish after school.

In primary school if you live in an area with high concentration of Finnish, you will start your school with Finnish, but you will then move to use only Swedish in school. In time you will become completely Swedish because you are absorbed by Swedish culture and the way of life.

true,nieuweyork,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Under the regime, inventors will be able to apply to the European Patent Office for a patent valid in 25 of the bloc's 27 member states.

So, exactly like now, except that it covers fewer countries.

&gt; Supporters of a unitary patent claim that it will drastically reduce costs for businesses and entrepreneurs. Europe-wide patents currently cost around €35,000 each, according to the European Patent Office (EPO), almost 10 times the cost in the US. The European Commission says that EU patent costs could fall to €4,725.

Why? All of the cost is in the lawyers who prepare the application, and they already only have to prepare it once. 

&gt; Meanwhile, parliament legal Affairs committee chair Klaus Hehne Lehne told reporters that the rules would strengthen the EU's hand when negotiating on patent rules with China.

How so?

&gt; For his part, Jonathan Zuck, President of the Association for Competitive Technology, said the new system would ""remove a major hurdle to innovation and growth"" by protecting small businesses form ""fragmented national legislation.""

Where's the evidence that small businesses are hurt by ""fragmented national legislation""? The rules are the same for everyone right now, and they mostly act to prevent small businesses from innovating.

Given that no-one can really point to any benefit they want to talk about, this sounds like a way to strengthen patent protections to the benefit of transnational businesses in countries whose national legislatures wanted to have weaker patent protection.

Hiding behind the idea of spam control to censor opinions you disagree with is censorship neverthless.

No I'm a racist because I truly believe that there are races and differences between them. Whites and Asians have been pretty much always ahead of blacks for the past thousands of years, I believe that surely there's a genetic component responsible for the differences in development between each civilization, a 100% environmental theory does not satisfy me since if it were true then I wouldn't expect such consistency for thousands of years.

Fact (source)

Most gypsies don't have regular jobs and live in shacks/trailers, so they don't pay taxes. (actually never seeing one if not in this situation)


They don't pay rent or any fee on the lands they occupy. (friend in mayor's office)


They don't buy subway tickets - every now and then they I see them looking for the revisor or actually being fined. (every single time I see them on the subway)


They rob people passing by if in a quiet/dark place. (friend who lives near a gypsy encampment)

In my eyes, the are no more than parasites, with very little to none contribution to society.
Sorry if this can be seen as racist or bigoted, but it's my honest impression on these people.

Šokantna ispovijest: Otac me želio prodati za gajbu piva - Shocking, my father sold me for a box of beer

Tarife su dobro poznate: djevojke se prodaju u obitelj ženika za cijenu od 7500 do 15.000 kuna, ovisno o tome jesu li djevice - The price is well known, 1000 or 2000 Euros, depending if the girl is a virgin

14-godišnjakinju iz romskog naselja Capraške poljane kod Siska, roditelji su prodali za – konja. - 14 year old girl was sold by her parents for a horse

Rođena sam u velikoj, deseteročlanoj obitelji u romskom naselju u Piškorovcu. Kada sam sa šest godina poželjela krenuti u školi, roditelji su poludjeli jer su smatrali da sam potrebnija kod kuće. ‘Što će ti škola, ionako ćemo te udati’, govorili su mi - prisjeća se Blaženka koja je unatoč protivljenju roditelja čvrsto odlučila krenuti u školu. - I was born in a 10 member family in Roma village. I wanted to go to school when i was aged 6, but parents wanted me to work at home ""you don't need school, we will merry you"" they told me.

Prvih dana dolazila sam prljava, raščupana i poderane odjeće, ali i tako mala znala sam da nešto moram učiniti od svog života. Kod kuće je bio živi pakao: otac je fizički zlostavljao našu majku, zbog čega je na kraju dobio i dvije i pol godine kazne zatvora. - first days of school i was dirty, my cloths were torn, but i knew what i had to do. home was hell, father abused our mother and he got 2.5 years of prison for it finally.


Sa 16 godina prvi put sam se zaljubila, ali otac je imao druge planove za mene. Odlučio me prodati u obitelj ženika kojega je već odredio, za gajbu piva. - i fell in love aged 16, but my father had other plans ... he had a guy for me .... ha gave me away for a box of beer


and so on ..... that's the culture we are speaking of here.

That's how they live. this was told by a Roma girl, one of few who escaped that fucking life.

true,weland,ROMA,Romania,"I'll try my best :-).

Background: lived in Eastern Europe, with a few pauses along the years, but overall gathered a lot of time there. Also went to school there. Also, I currently work and live there. Most of my experience is related to Romania and Serbia, but I'm quite sure it applies to *most* Eastern Europe.

Historically, Eastern Europe has had a sizeable Roma population, and it probably comes as no surprise that they were not exactly well-liked, mostly because it was the late Middle Ages (oh -- and prolongued, as much as you can call it that way in the the not-exactly-feudal system of Eastern Europe) and people were stupid. In Romania, their legal status was pretty much that of a slave until the mid 19th century or so, I don't remember exactly how it was in Serbia. Historically, Eastern Eruope has also had a somewhat different social evolution from the Western Europe. The Enlightenment? Yeah, we pretty much spent that working grain and milking cows. There were some notable exceptions everywhere, of course, but not of the same scale. A combination of several factors led to a somewhat slow industrialization until the second half of the 19th century (I can ellaborate on that, at least when it comes to Romanian history, with which I am more familiar), the end result of which was that a sizeable portion of the population was still largely rural, unalphabetized, practicing subsistence agriculture and overall not being too willing to challenge traditional social norms. This isn't to say everyone here was dead poor. Romania, Serbia, Bulgaria, oh and Hungary (but those guys lived closer to the Germans for longer) had wonderful urban centers, a booming cultural trend, a growing scientific community and so on. It's just that the vast majority of those who labored (mostly in agriculture since -- you guessed it -- industry was kind of slow) were not exactly in the position where they begin to do interesting things, socially. Imagine 19th century England begining its industrial revolution and you have a pretty good comparison. Well, minus 15 centuries of political and cultural development. Turns out being in that place of the map where every big country fights every other big country for several centuries kind of sucks.

Ok, I said nothing about the gypsies so far. What happened to them through all this time? Well, the combination of a heavily traditionalistic, hardly alphabetized society with almost no cultural elite *and* a mostly nomadic (I'm hesitant to say ""nomadic"" because, well, the anthropological meaning of the term is somewhat different) culture with a strong dislike for those outside their culture is bound to breed exclusion. Most Romanians learned to dislike gypsies simply by social construction. Traditional Romanian (and, to some degree, Serbian and Bulgarian) social values are very much opposite to those of the Roma population. It didn't help that the Roma people didn't quite like outsiders, either. So, long story short, around the 1940s or so, there were large groups of gypsies that the other populations didn't really like and had historically enslaved; and of course the Roma communities didn't really get along well with the outsiders. Basically, both cultures had somewhat of a taboo on the other one. And most people of both population were either dead poor, or had so little property (and possibilities of development) that they were on the brink of it.

Then two things happened: Nazi Germany and communism. I won't bore you with the first part that much, it's probably familiar enough, but the other one is interesting because, starting with the mid 1960s or so, it had a very strong nationalistic construct. Needless to say, *again*, it sucked to be an ethnic minority around here, perhaps with some exceptions in the former Yugoslavia, even that one ended badly. The Roma were already well marginalized; the new regimes had no reason to improve on that -- and even if they had, they pretty much fucked up almost everything they tried to improve, so you can guess what happened to what they didn't. The mutual exclusion simply continued to build up.

So far it sounds like Eastern Europeans suck and the Roma are pure spirits, but there are (as usual) two sides on each coin. Turns out traditional societies are actually quite ok with strangers here in Eastern Europe, as long as you're not too blatantly different at first. All the foreigners who come here love our food, love how hospitable we are, enjoy our cities and or warm conversation over a beer -- and people don't do that out of a fake kindness, most of them really are that way. Until you begin putting cranberry sauce on your steak, or you leave the spaghetti al dente instead of boiling them until they're so soft you can have a spider use them for webs. At that point, they freak out. So there are actually a lot of people of Roma ethnicity that are not hated by anyone around here, simply because they at least tried to fit in a little. They're the famous ""that's not true, I have a gypsy neighbor and he's a really fine guy, we even have a beer at my place every once in a while"", or ""no, I know a lot of gypsy musicians and THEY ROCK"". Why don't you hear about them? The same reason why you don't hear about my other neighbors: they don't do anything notable. Well, unless they're really awesome people like Johnny Răducanu, which most of the people *everywhere* aren't. In most cases, when someone from around here says ""Dude, I don't have *anything* with gypsies"", they really mean it.

What about the *other* ones you hear about? Turns out -- like in every cultural group -- that being a hardline traditionalist doesn't require being consciously aware of it (which also makes it look kind of out of place, because you're bound to think that no one who can understand and express something like hardline conservativeness can be that fucking stupid). Every highly-individualised, closed cultural group, with a history of marginalization and a general dislike of people outside itself is bound to be rather resistant to change.

And theirs is. Unfortunately, the very vocal advocates of this group are so annoying that everyone tends to extend a lot of hatred from them to those they are advocating for.

To a Westerner, it looks like Easterners are whining: just put the guys in school, help them if they are in need and shut the fuck up, what can be so hard? Unfortunately, every Easterner has had the experience of Roma parents simply refusing to let their children go to school, or sending them to school only for the state aid; almost every Easterner who was mugged or beaten has had the experience of getting it from a gypsy. Not because all of them are like that -- simply because there still are huge communities that practice this as a way of life, and *like it*. These aren't groups of opressed people who are kicked out of schools, these are hardline social groups that *refuse* sending children to school (which, by the way, is actually free). There are otherwise more foundations and NGOs trying to finance poor Roma children through school than there are for helping gifted Romanian children through school. There are even separate places for Roma children in public education, which are only eligible for members of their ethnic group, so that the barrier of entry to quality higher education (i.e. the minimum required grades) are lower. The guys who beg on the streets of Paris aren't the heroes of the groups we marginalized, they're the representatives of those who have been otherwise consistently refusing (or worse, mocking) help for the last 20 years or so. The heroes of the groups we historically marginalized are now well-off, settled people with professional careers and nice families. The other ones are no longer marginalized just because they're gypsies.

It helps even less that these communities are either extremely poor or obsecenely rich. Remember, this is Eastern Europe, where a 25 year-old teaching assistant can barely afford the general living expenses, let alone the rent for a single-room apartment. People are bound to hate the obscenely rich folks, who have no job but 12-bedroom houses (you are free to guess where they got the money from). The extremely poor communities? They just make bad economic decisions, like all poor people. Every last cent they make ends up invested in material goods, not education or development.

(Edited for some minor typos; I hope I haven't missed any...)

tl;dr Due to historical reasons, the Roma communities have been heavily segregated, which is less big a deal than it sounds because their culture isn't exactly open to outsiders, either. Nowadays, people hate it that they have to go through a lot of effort to support communities that otherwise refuse or simply profit from the support, while continuing their practice. Most folks feel that the Roma communities should try their best to fit in, in exchange for the aid and tolerance they get. When they don't do it because it's against their cultural values, people are naturally frustrated.",0,1355347221,null,0,1355353259,0,c7fkuki,t3_14qdz8,t1_c7fkuki,t1_c7fjtef,null,1430656329,53,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,53

&gt;Šokantna ispovijest: Otac me želio prodati za gajbu piva

Shocking, my father sold me for a box of beer

&gt;Tarife su dobro poznate: djevojke se prodaju u obitelj ženika za cijenu od 7500 do 15.000 kuna, ovisno o tome jesu li djevice

The price is well known, 1000 or 2000 Euros, depending if the girl is a virgin

&gt;14-godišnjakinju iz romskog naselja Capraške poljane kod Siska, roditelji su prodali za – konja.

14 year old girl was sold by her parents for a horse

&gt;Rođena sam u velikoj, deseteročlanoj obitelji u romskom naselju u Piškorovcu. Kada sam sa šest godina poželjela krenuti u školi, roditelji su poludjeli jer su smatrali da sam potrebnija kod kuće. ‘Što će ti škola, ionako ćemo te udati’, govorili su mi - prisjeća se Blaženka koja je unatoč protivljenju roditelja čvrsto odlučila krenuti u školu.

I was born in a 10 member family in Roma village. I wanted to go to school when i was aged 6, but parents wanted me to work at home ""you don't need school, we will merry you"" they told me.

&gt;Prvih dana dolazila sam prljava, raščupana i poderane odjeće, ali i tako mala znala sam da nešto moram učiniti od svog života. Kod kuće je bio živi pakao: otac je fizički zlostavljao našu majku, zbog čega je na kraju dobio i dvije i pol godine kazne zatvora.

first days of school i was dirty, my cloths were torn, but i knew what i had to do. home was hell, father abused our mother and he got 2.5 years of prison for it finally.

&gt;Sa 16 godina prvi put sam se zaljubila, ali otac je imao druge planove za mene. Odlučio me prodati u obitelj ženika kojega je već odredio, za gajbu piva.

The problem is that these people have a really twisted culture where anything goes. Theft and prostitution are encouraged by everyone. The girls who know how to steal/beg better are sold for higher prices, for example. The whole cultural system is inhumane and parasitic. I'd go as far as to say that it's a familial criminal organization disguised as a culture.

Edit: Another example: They complain that they have no money to send their children to school and request all government handouts as possible, yet the truth is that they keep children away from school and train them to steal and prostitute themselves, beating them up if they fail to make money. They contribute nothing to civilized society yet want to milk it as much as possible.

I consider myself very left leaning and hate racism, but these people are a blight. A normal family acting the way they act would have their children removed by social services. If the same happened to them they would call it eugenics or whatever.

Well, I sympathise with your sentiment but this ""***your share***"" business is not so simple. 

You need to perceive the other side of the argument. Nobody, as far as I've heard, claims that they ""*don't want to give any of [their] money*"" for infrastructure etc. It's just that if your income is over a million Euros a year, then, even if you were to contribute a slightly smaller percentage of it to government, ""***your share***"" would still be many times (at least ten times) the share of most taxpayers, many of whom make significantly less than 10% of your income (or 100 k Euros a year). And if, furthermore, you pay **an even larger percentage** of your (much larger) income than the average taxpayer's smaller percentage of a smaller income, ""***your share***"" of taxes becomes comparatively huge. You might even start feeling somewhat cheated by a system that takes so much of your money, spreads it around to benefit everyone and that, in the end, makes you out to be *the bad guy* to boot!

So my story is: to avoid being in breach of the law, if I'm here for more than 3 months I need to declare myself a resident. To do this I waited in line for two hours to get a belligerent woman who threw a form at me that had been re-Xeroxed about twenty times - lucky I brought a translator - telling me I need:

* Passport

* Address

* Form saying that my government will fund any healthcare OR buy expensive private healthcare from the Italian government's own provider

* Form from my government declaring my marital status

* Italian tax card (codice fiscale)

The passport I have, the tax card I already obtained, it only took two days sitting in an office for 1-2 hours at a time. The health form she is requesting hasn't existed in the EU for four years. The address will be confirmed *by the fucking police who will come round and check my toothbrush etc. to confirm I live there*.

The marital status form doesn't exist in my country at all. There is no information from the Italian government about this form online.

Managed to get the new health form sent to me with one ten-minute phone call to my government. Cross my fingers that they will accept it.

Went back to the office to explain the situation with the marital status form. Waited another two hours. ""You need to make a self-declaration. But you're in the wrong office. Go to another one."" 

Went to another office. Waited two hours. ""Your self-declaration form needs to be notarized by a lawyer."" I need to find a bilingual lawyer registered in Italy and my home country and pay them lots of money.

That's where I am at the moment. 

Reciprocally, here's what an Italian has to do to live in my country:

* Turn up

* Get a social security number (10 minutes)

Sub-option 3.2 was submitted to the council for approval in November 2010. 
&gt;At the Council meeting on 10 November 2010, it was recorded that there was no unanimity
to go ahead with the proposed Regulation on the translation arrangements.

NOTE: There was no unanimity due to Italy and Spain. The document reflects the decision of the 25 other member states to go ahead with the proposal and establish the enhanced cooperation, as well as making it clear that Italy and Spain are free to join whenever they desire.

Sub-option 3.2 is *""the proposed Regulation on the translation arrangements""*. The cost reductions stem from this. Sub-option 3.2 is what the enhanced cooperation is built upon.
The following is the file in which the legislative act is documented: [COUNCIL DECISION authorising enhanced cooperation in the area of
the creation of unitary patent protection.](http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st05/st05538.en11.pdf)

See #4 for the above quote. Now, going through the remaining points up to and including #16, you can see that absolutely nothing is being mentioned about changes to the *""the proposed Regulation on the translation arrangements.""* This can only lead to one conclusion: The savings associated with the Regulation on translation arrangements - the savings clearly depicted in table from p. 36 of the other document - are the ones that the Council agreed upon. In other words, they agreed upon sub-option 3.2.

In my opinion, it's not a matter of ""their mindset"" in terms of ethnicity. It's a matter of a social group's mindset. This group isn't predisposed to it because it's made up of gypsies per se -- it's predisposed to it as a set of cultural constructs and values, which are the way they are because they worked for the members of the group, not because they were such and such. It's a set of values we obviously don't agree with (hence, it looks so ""heavily messed up"" to you -- it doesn't look a lot better to me either).

Unfortunately, modern Europe also has a taboo against sending people away or telling them to fuck off. The white colonialist has been an asshole for so long, having denied others the things they rightfully wanted, that now he can't even bear the thought of admitting there's a social group that doesn't *want* his values. And, with our history of deportation and forced civilisation, of course we can ""integrate"" any group, we just have to be tolerant and help them overcome their marginalized position. Could that segregation be partly voluntary from both sides? Never! Who wouldn't want to be part of the modern European world?

Really, amidst all the buzz with the Roma being sent home by the French, I was very zen about it. I can totally understand them. Really, the only objection I had to the gesture was that they were sending them *back here*. Where they wouldn't knock on the door of the hundreds of NGOs and anti-discrimination groups to find work options, wouldn't reach one of the public agencies for workplace occupation or return their children to schools.

No, sorry. It is one of the cornerstones of the EU. The CAP used to be 80% of the budget.....Personally I wish the same as you, but I really think it is politically impossible. 


&gt; Whoever does not get it for the farmers will see ten thousand tractors descend on Paris spraying milk on everyone and blocking the roads (half sarcastic...)

So, why don't your politicians grow some balls? Seriously, as long as you just cringe and hide from protests- they are suceeding. They will continue, of course. Do you think it should be so for everyone, everywhere? The Germans are afraid to deal with the metal workers, so we all have to pay double the price for metals? Are you OK with paying four times the price of paper since the Swedes are afraid that someone will throw timber on the street? Of course not, those areas are dealt with as markets, and France would most certainly tell us to man up. Yet, *the French* should be able to decide for the rest of the union, keeping up tarifs, quotas etc - that is grossly unfair. 


&gt;the situation for farmers in France is catastrophic and they cant survive without subsidies)

It is the same for everyone. I am not saying they should stop, completely, but they should stop being ridiculous and tailored to French needs. And yes, it will affect the farmers hard, everywhere, and everyone has to deal with that. 

&gt;That way France can pay its farmers without always being accused of bieng selfish (even though we are net contributors to EU)

France is being selfish - sorry. Not unusual for a country, we all are, but this is affecting evryone in extreme.  The whole CAP is tailored after the French needs. For example, why should a farmer in France receive more for a cow going outdoors than a Swedish farmer? Or, why does a Polish farmer receive even less? Oh, and 4 % of *the whole EU budget* goes to the growing of wine, and it is certainly not because of the multitude of wine yards in UK, Finland and Poland. Would the French people be OK that 4 % of the *whole* budget were going into subsidising vodka in Poland and Latvia - I hardly think so? No matter how you look at it, the CAP is bad, and the only ones making money from it is the French (and possibly Spanish, Italian) farmers. It is bad for the farmers, the EU, the world and above all, the private person who has to pay a lot more for food now. It has to be redesigned - badly. Personally, I don't think it will happen, and would prefer it to be taken out of the budget. Then the French tax payers can pay it farmers how much they want in subsidies and it would just make the price cheaper for me, a non French tax payer

Is it all the French, no. I think you usually have Spain on your side as well, but as far as I know, you are the only net paying country that wants to keep it, and I don't think any Eastern European want to, no Scandinavian, not the UK, Germany etc, so it is rather insane that the CAP should continue to be such a big part of the budget.

To be specific taxation is the revenue of the government, not ""forcing you to share your money"". Everyone benefits from the government spending back that revenue, including you (even indirectly, for example you might say you don't use the subway : other people do, therefore also free up the streets for your car), it's not a net loss for no reason whatsoever.

And yes, I do think whether the way you gained it was fair or not can be important : it's valid to consider one of the task of the government to correct injustices that can ""accidentally"" arise from society, like the disconnect I talked about that can emerge with bigger corporations. If its action is enacted in this way, it can be regarded as justified, and in the opposite case it may not be, even if it's the exact same action. Enacting taxation, even of an exceptional nature, on a top CEO or on a poverty-stricken community isn't the same.

I can pm you the address/phone number if you want. As for things to do in Florence, see the Duomo, it's beautiful on the outside and climbing to the top of the dome is really cool. I don't know what you like doing for fun, but if you like museums/renaissance churches, you could get a Firenze pass and get into every church museum in Florence for a flat fee (i don't remember how much they cost exactly). Some great sights to see would be the Santa Croce, which is an awesome church (Galileo and Michelangelo are buried there and it is way more interesting than the Duomo). Also, the San Lorenzo is the old Cathedral in Florence and IMHO it is much more beautiful (on the inside) than the Duomo. If you're looking for good food, my favorite pizza place is Gusta Pizza, which is right next to the Church of Santo Spirito. My favorite local place is Mostodolce, on Via Nazionale. This is a little pub/restaurant that brews their own STRONG beer and has the best homemade gnocchi and burgers in Florence. This is also a super local place, you will only find Italians here and a few American students, but definitely NO tourists. If you want to more local things, try out the outdoor market around San Lorenzo (the old cathedral mentioned earlier). It has a ton of cool leather items (Florence is known for their leather). Also, a super cool place to eat and try local food is the Mercato Centrale, which is right next to the San Lorenzo. It is a super local place and has the best beef sandwich I have ever had, EVER. My favorite Gelateria in Florence is Gelateria di Neri, on Via di Neri (avoid all of the gelaterias near the Duomo with the huge stacks of gelato, they are all fake and overprices).

true,mielove,SWED,Sweden,"That what ends up happening most of the time (after a trial). Problem with having a blanket ban on asylum for a nationality is that there are always exceptions.  
  
The USA is one of the best countries in the world to live in and has good relations with the rest of the West - yet Americans have in some cases been granted asylum in other Western countries (mostly for cases of military dissertation). It's not a black-and-white issue.  
  
These Roma asylum seekers in Canada aren't actually granted asylum most of the time, you realise. That's not why they're a drain on the system - it's because of the cost of trials and their welfare checks before the trials. I'd say there should be a rule in Canada that EU-nationals seeking asylum shouldn't qualify for welfare. Of course then we get into the territory of discrimination based on background but something's got to give if we want to make the asylum system more efficient. 

  
I'd support Sweden installing such a rule too since we also get a hell of a lot of EU nationals seeking asylum. Since there's free movement within the EU and no need for VISA's asking such people to pay for their stay doesn't seem like too much to ask. If they actually are genuine asylum seekers they'd find a way to make it.  
  
Now, obviously most asylum seekers in Sweden are from outside of the EU but then it becomes more difficult to weed out the fakers early on. I personally know people who've had to sell all their belongings and paid 100,000's of crowns to be smuggled into the EU (and then Sweden). I'm not opposed to the idea of such people getting some financial help whilst they wait for their asylum claims to be processed. I do get the idea behind this.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Sorry, I don't know much about the details of the CAP, and how it's tailored to the French production specifically, but how is it a problem that the EU subsidize agriculture?

Well, for one thing we are keeping the prices high through custom/tariff. That is harming the 3rd world farmers who can not compete with us and sell their stuff to survive. This is something constantly argued about at the WTO. If they were allowed to sell on our market, the food would be cheaper. 

When you subsidise something, you make sure that they do not have to compete on the open market. Thus, you are not making sure that they are efficient, and in the end the bill goes to the tax payers - twice. First, to subsidise the farmer, second through the fact that the food is more expensive. 

Also, I am not saying one should cut all subsidies in one swoop - not a single one from 2014, but they should be lowered significally, and in an ideal world perhaps, phased out (doubt that it will happen thought). That might be a dream, but there is no excuse for the levels of subsidies we are paying for now.

The argument for the CAP is:

1) that the farmers can't survive without them and we need to subsidise them to keep them alive (living countryside, near food, open spaces.. - all that.  

2) That the international food market is unstable and in a hostile world we need to keep the capacity, in case of shortage. 

I'd say that both those arguments have some value, and I am not totally against every subsidy. However:

* If we care about surviving in case of food shortage - shouldn't the CAP be tailored towards that? It isn't, not by a long shot. 4 % of the *whole* EU budget goes to wine for God's sake. Important for survival- sure..........And they are certainly not tailoring the subsidies towards the crop that one would need in case of starvation. So, if you use that argument - then tailor it towards it then.

* The EU supports a free market - but all of a sudden they don't? 

* 3 % of the population receives 44 (!) % of the budget. It is nowhere near reasonable, no matter ones arguments. And, yes, that is the number France is arguing for in the 2014-2020 budget.

* The benefits are nowhere near being equal among EU countries. And we are not talking about a country with less farmland receiving less money, we are talking about countries receiving less money for the same service, or, for example, that the CAP is tailored towards France/Western/Southern Europe. For example, Eastern European farmers do not receive the same amount of money, for the same service, as a French farmer. 

There is also the case that the whole CAP is tailored towards France and its needs. A farmer for example receives more money for a cow that has been grassing in the field, than in a field/forest area. The thing is, traditionally in Sweden we have used our (few) fields for crop, and the forest for grassing.  Thus, the Swedes don't get the same amount of money for the identical  cow, since the EU only care about the French way of grassing, of course. The fact that we don't even have that many fields to begin with, doesn't seem to face anyone.

And - what is agriculture. As it is now, 4 % of the *whole* EU budget goes to wine, an industry that certainly is not important for survival, should it really be covered? And, if it is, I hope very, very much, that the French are OK with the Nordic countries and Eastern Europe clearing some forests to grow vodka. We are aiming to get 20 &amp; of the whole budget. Would that work? Of course not- it is only *wine* that get subsidised that much.....Etc

To sum it up. Personally I would like the agricultural budget to be lifted up and handed by the individual countries, then the French tax payers can subsidise their farmers all day long. I don't think that it is going to happen however, so I would like to see a radical overhaul of the whole system.

Curring down on research/education etc while keeping the CAP is unforgivable, and I am keeping the French responsible for that.

You are very, very wrong on that one. I'd like to see proof for that claim.

&gt;Maybe we get a lot for the CAP, but eastern countries receive a lot more infrastructure subsidies.

And what is Sweden getting? Finland? UK? Why is France, who is one of the richest countries getting more of the CAP than *any* other country, almost no matter how you count.

You are also receiving more money, for the same service - why? Is that fair? Why is a French cow better than a Swedish or a Polish cow, of same species, age, weight, grass feed etc. 

&gt;but whenever you have a redistribution mechanism, some will receive more than others. That's the whole point

No, the whole point is to transfer from the richer to the poorer, and contribute, as much as one can. Are you saying that French farmers are poorer than Swedish and Polish ones? And, why shouldn't you contribute more towards the CAP (and your farmers receive less) since you are a much richer country.

I was under the impression you were implying that this whole Tintin case is an example of how certain foreigners act like conquerors, and trying to force their whatever-it-is on us. For this specific case, that doesn't compute, because this case got thrown out of court. The guy lost. And in more general cases, I disagreed with your implication (if that was what you were implying). 

My point was, in my reply to jankystank's ""I would never go to any other country and try to impose my culture on them"", that it is all too human that people very slowly adapt when moving to another world. It's the age-old ""You can take the European out of Europe, but you can't take Europe out of the European.""    
    
Your response to this was ""that's different, we were conquerors back then."" Now there I agree with your observation, but disagree with the implication (""Today, they are not coming here as conquerors, so they shouldn't be thinking of changing our whole culture."") 
During the colonial days we were in a luxurious enough position that when we moved to these other countries, we not only didn't have to adapt, the original population even had to adapt to us. The Congolese people strongly westernized under Belgian colonial rule. French became, and still is, the official language of the country. The indigenous population would not get near any position of even minor importance in society if they didn't dress and talk like a western european.     

Long story short, they had to adapt to us *and nothing of the sort is happening to Europeans now*. 
    
Basically, I don't see how this Tintin case is an example of ""they are coming here to dictate our way of living"". We do not speak the immigrants' language, they speak ours. We don't wear the immigrants' clothes, they wear ours. (Seriously… Apart from a small headscarf it's all jeans and H&amp;M shirts here in Brussels.

true,Foxkilt,FRAN,France,"&gt;No matter how you look at it, the CAP is bad

Ok let's go:

* The very aim of agricultural policy: having your countryside cultivated (and inhabited) and be able to be self-reliant when it comes to food (which is the most important product a country can have).  
Why is it necessary? Because we want to overproduce so as to have a sufficient amount of food during a bad time.  
The principle is certainly not ""bad no matter how you look at it"". And food shortage is not some fantasy from 60 years ago: look at North Africa and, to a lower extent Russia 2 or 3 ears ago.  
Of course overproduction means that you can't have a free market and you have to subsidise.

* You seem to be suggesting that France leeches on other countries. Let's imagine the CAP is removed tomorrow, and that everyone keeps paying the same share to the reduced EU budget.  
In 2011, CAP's cost[ has been 55 bn €](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/2011/2011_en.cfm), on a 125 bn€ global budget, 19 bn have been paid by France.  
If we were to completely remove the CAP, France should the have to pay only 10.6 bn. Let's round it down to 10 bn: France pays 0.8 bn for the UK rebate which would have no reason to exist.  
So slashing the CAP completely would mean +9 bn€ for France.  
Coincidentally, that is about (9.5 bn) what[ French farmers got from it in 2011](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm).
 France contributes to the CAP.  
So France is a net beneficiary from the CAP, but only by 300-600 milion euros (I do not have the most recent figures and I rounded my calculations).  
Also note that France's share in payments is decreasing (from the previous link, I have 2009: 8.2% 2010: 8.0%, 2011; 7.4%).

EDIT: i should also point out that I used the EU total budget, not only the 108bn paid by member-states. If I do so (which is more correct: the custom income would not decrease if the CAP was cut) I find that France is a net contributor to the CAP by 1 bn€.

* On the wine point: wine is a perfectly legitimate agricultural product. It represents [~5% of the value of European agriculture](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-FK-11-001/EN/KS-FK-11-001-EN.PDF) (I believe EEA, not EU), so 4% of the subsidies seems about right.

* (not really a debating point, more of a precisions) Poland, AFAIK has  big interest in the CAP as well. Remember the French payments are falling? It mostly goes to Poland.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You seem to be suggesting that France leeches on other countries.

I most certainly am. Of those 55 billion Euros, France receives 19 billion €. Are you suggesting that France, has 19/55 = 34% of the agricultural production of the whole EU? Or 34 % of the agricultural land? If so, could you provide the numbers for that, please?  You simply receive more that you should. The CAP is tailored towards France's need.

For example, you never answered why a Swedish farmer and a Polish farmer receives less money for the exact same cow (who has been brought up the same way). If that is not leeching, what is? Just explain to me, why your cow is more worth than mine, or the Polish one? I'd love to hear that. 

&gt;So France is a net beneficiary from the CAP, but only by 300-600 milion euros (I do not have the most recent figures and I rounded my calculations).

You are one of the richest countries in the EU and have extremely fertile land.Why should you be a net receipient at all? Why can't you be efficient? Britain isn't, Germany isn't, Sweden/DK isn't (and we have much tougher land). The CAP is not a supersalary for farmers, it is for one of the two reasons stated (1) production against survival or (2)tradition/keeping the land working. Do France hold 34 % of the tradition of all the 27 countries too?  Is it more important that your land is kept open? Then why? Why are your farmers more important than the German ones, or why are they so hopelessly bad that they need more subsidies?   

&gt;On the wine point: wine is a perfectly legitimate agricultural product. It represents ~5% of the value of European agriculture (I believe EEA, not EU), so 4% of the subsidies seems about right. 

Are you claiming that anything that grows is agriculture, or are you claiming that that we need wine to survive. I mean - which of the arguments 1 (preserve the land) or 2 (need it for survival) are you using. 

You are obviously intelligent and is not claiming that wine is necessary for our survival, so I am suggesting you are using number 1 - tradition. Well, isn't it odd that the CAP is tailored towards the *French* traditions? You see, in other countries we have this traditions of vodka for example. Oddly enough, when *our* farmers, need subsudies for that, they do not get it, to half the degree that the French farmers get. Also, for example Bulgarian wine farms receive less than French. Why?

Shouldn't we look at *all* the agriculture in *all* the 27 countries then and decide what is important. Why is it, oddly, that you get most subsidies for the things you grow in France, in the French way. Shouldn't it be more efficient to look at all the 27 countries, deem what is efficient and share it between those 27. Or, why is it better to grow tomatoes and olives than potatoes and cabbage? For survival I know the 2nd one is better, shouldn't they receive way more money then in comparison to wine. That would gear the subsidies towards Sweden though. 

The fact is, that the whole system is geared towards what France need. Sweden have tried to change the fact that our (identical )cows are less worth since 1995, but we are getting blocked, by, guess who - France. All of the Eastern European countries have to have a reversed discount, because, when they joined all of a sudden thousands of this small farmers joined too. They receive a lot of money in France (and the rest of Western Europe to be fair), but the fact is would a Polish farmer receive the same amount, for exactly the same product the system would crash. So, instead of we changing, one obviously pay the Eastern Europeans less. However, most other net paying countries thought this was unfair, and that *we* would change instead and is advocating for a change in the system. France didn't. I wonder if you coud explain why? 



Also, it shows how unsustainable the system really is. Even when 44 % of the budget goes to it, we still can't pay everyone an equal amount, which is the fair and proper thing to do. The whole system is unsustainable and need an overhaul. I am very much against subsidies, but I can learn to live with them if their are fair and sensible. There is nothing sensible supporting wine in Spain and tulips in the Netherlands and in the end, making everything more expensive for the Europan tax payer. 


The answer, for a lot of people and countries is to look at it the way I do. The CAP needs to be removed (which is a dream) or very much reformed. And, trust me - France has fought this every step of the way, France has blocked reforms a soon as they can. Even now, 20 % of the population is unemployed, a whole generation is lost in some countries, and we really, really need to invest in structural programs, education, and research. Guess what - those programs are being *cut* in the 2014-2020 budget. Guess what is not being cut - the CAP. Still 44%. And they employ 3 % of the population. And, who is fighting for this? Not Germany, not Sweden, not UK, not the Netherlands, not Belgium, not Finland - but France. So, do not tell me France is interested in the European Union,  working together, or the future, because what France is fighting for is the interest of France and its farmers, nothing else. In the end I think you are shooting yourself in the foot, there are millions of unemployed in France who could benefit, not from subsidising wine (why the hell can't they function on a market like all the other wine countries, is French wine going so bad) but from research and education. However, you are not fighting for them in the European Parlament. I wouldn't care if our agricultural policies weren't integrated and every fifth of every SEK Sweden pays to goes to a French farmer, but it now they are, and it does. The way French is treating the CAP is harming Europe, and yes, I am holding you responsible for it.

You seem to fundamentally misunderstand taxation. When a private entity is greedy, they are hoarding money for themselves. When a country is (as you put it) ""greedy"", they invest it all back into the population of that country. [And then some.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt)

Tax money goes straight back to the people in a way that is (ideally) economically, socially and environmentally productive. Hoarded private wealth would *rarely* be invested in a way that was much better at this, btw.

Hoarded wealth (if it's not spent on building pointless monuments and luxuries) will mostly go into investments designed to get the best return/risk profile. You can absolutely guarantee that it will *not* be invested in the most efficient way from a social, environmental, sustainable, or long-term point-of-view.

This ROI maximisation is not the same as overall value maximisation. It's therefore distortive, and thank god we've got a second mechanism - government - which counters some of this distortion.

Ah! So you didn't read what I wrote.

Let me rephrase to help you understand my view: 

Business investors and capital markets will invest money in a particular way, a *characteristic* way. They'll prefer some things over other things. The things they take into consideration will only be a *subset* of all meaningful considerations. For example, if there's a nice, juicy ROI on an petroleum project, do you really think they'll hold back because of the consequences of global warming?

They will have an investment *fingerprint*. They'll be leaking externalities all over the place, and the types of externalities are pretty well understood.

The same, of course, is true of government. Governments have a characteristic fingerprint too, although it is very different to that of business investors and capital markets.

&gt; Who decides what 'overall value maximization' is? 

With all due respect, this is a question only an economist would ask. 

If you ask a social scientist about the effects of income inequality...  
If you ask an environmental scientist about pollution...  
If you ask a doctor about health...  
If you ask an urban designer about our built environment...

You'll get a wealth of objective, scientific information on how to maximise overall value. And how to do it *much* better than we are right now. There's an absolute treasure trove of knowledge out there that is well established, built on solid evidence, and would lead to a considerably better world than the one we live in.

(Of course, this is imperfect and evolving. But despite those imperfections, it's still a bit better than what we've currently got - just look at the number of scientists who are desperate for regulation to be altered.)

But at some point, we've decided that we'll ignore all of that knowledge and let the invisible hand do it for us.

To a person like me (a STEM major), it seems plainly obvious that the market is distortive relative to the above knowledge. And that the invisible hand simply cannot be relied upon as the **sole** source of our economic decision making. If we did, we'd end up with a In Soviet Russia™ level of distortion.

What should we be doing instead? Routing part of our GDP through a different mechanism. Like mixed economies do. A mechanism that makes different decisions, places different values on things, and compensates for distortions of the first.

The only smart thing to do, in my view, is to refrain from ideology and prejudice against government and taxation and find solutions that align best with what our best science tells us.

I don't just mean the commonly-referred-to political checks and balances between different government bodies, but also things as simple as having a boss, and having coworkers and indeed citizens looking over your shoulder to check that you're not doing anything funny.

If this were true, en masse emigration and capital flight wouldn't be occurring throughout the most progressively taxed states in Europe.

And you keep using the phrase 'distortion'. Operationally define it as you're using it. That might help smooth any potential communication barriers.

Again, I take you at your word that you're discussing honestly, so I'd like you to do my case justice and address the disproportionate opportunity costs weighed by such punitive taxation. At 75% marginal tax bracket has vastly diminishing returns due to capital flight, localized investment opportunity costs, etc.

true,turnusb,CHIN,China,"When anything serves as an excuse to bash on a group of people by generalizing them and tieing the entire group to what we perceive as exclusive negative traits of their culture, it's very blatant racism. Culture is just the backdoor through which you express it.

The things you dislike about their culture are just as common among every other people. There are wiseasses and desperate people everywhere. It's as if racists forget roughly the same percentage of all people on Earth is moved by greed as the percentage of gypsies is.

The problem with gypsies isn't a cultural problem alone, it's related to human geography and how they affect habits. Gypsies adapted well to rural areas. European nations disregarded this and forced urbanism on them and we're now surprised it didn't go well.

I've come to the conclusion that my problem with this issue has nothing to do with the gypsy race or culture. I have a problem with the programs of forced assimilation our governments have thrown at them. Speaking of portuguese gypsies here, a group that has evolved into a rural culture, it doesn't help them that our governments' assimilation programs have lured them to quasi-free suburban apartment-'settlements' and some money on top of that. These programs created an avalanche of disenfranchisement. And now most of them don't knowhow to live otherwise. Just like any other portuguese people on this type of welfare programs (RSI anyone?). It doesn't help that the governments' don't carry these programs all the way through either.

If these programs hadn't been implemented, and instead had they been subject to the law like everyone else (regarding business practices mainly) a portion of gypsies would have assimiliated and the others would have disappeared. As it is, the programs haven't achieved any significantly higher rate of assimilation than if they hadn't been implemented, and now we have to wait it out. Meanwhile authorities close their eyes to their fiscally unlawful business practices, which generates a whole new set of problems, among which further scorn from the general population. Of course people buy their products, but everyone calls it the 'gypsy market'. Their business practices, and the authorities' enabling, generate segregation attitudes from everyone.

If you want to blame their culture for their situation then you should also blame our culture for enabling it and even instigating it, while acknowledging that our culture also produces institutionalized wiseasses of all sorts, from petty crimes competing with gypsies to world-scale fraud (which is much much worse then said petty crimes).",0,1355372611,null,0,false,0,c7fs4f4,t3_14qdz8,t1_c7fs4f4,t1_c7frkey,null,1430659823,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

- A one-person company (""entreprise individuelle"")
- A simplified fiscal status (""statut microfiscal simplifié"")

It means that you, the legal person, become a company with a SIRET number, which allows you to make bills.

In the intent, the idea was to give a status for people who were having side jobs. Before this, they used to not declare their revenue, being on the illegal side, but not worthy of a fiscal control. 

The idea is therefore to give a simple procedure that a single person who is not a fiscal expert can do. This was done by grouping **all** the taxes a company must pay into a single, flat, rate : 20% of your **revenue**. You don't pay VAT (called TVA in France) but you cannot substract your costs. And you have a revenue cap : 32k€ if you are providing services and (check it, I am not sure) about 80k€ if you are having a retailing activity. 

You pay every 3 months through a simple mail, or even online. It is done in 10 minutes. Your only obligation is to keep a log of your bills.

France already has some of the most progressive taxation in the world, so suggesting they're not contributing is little more than cognitive dissonance. Fleecing a politically unpopular minority only continues for so long before they leave for greener pastures.

The progressive taxation though doesn't work when you are actively avoiding it and I think this is what the PM is saying.  You can say that France has a progressive taxation system all you want and how this means the rich are taxed enough, but the conversation is about the rich slipping through the tax system set up.

true,JayKayAu,AUST,Australia,"&gt; Environmental Kuznets Curves are well-established

They are also heavily disputed. And the underlying principle of them is dubious. I would argue that the curve is missing the part at the right-hand-side where inequality goes back up again (i.e., the Occupy Movement and all that), due to disproportionate wealth accumulation which leads to corruption and problems via 2nd/3rd order effects.

&gt; If this were true, en masse emigration and capital flight wouldn't be occurring throughout most of progressive Europe.

I did not argue that we had actually *implemented* what we know.

&gt; At 75% marginal tax bracket has vastly diminishing returns due to capital flight, localized investment opportunity costs, etc.

Sure, I agree that this particular way of implementing taxation is pretty crappy. But the principle of taxation is not.

&gt; I simply object to the notion that capital flight is evil and it purged.

I wouldn't have called it evil, but I think capital flight needs to be reduced as much as possible. I am open to any scheme of taxation that addresses this (e.g., land tax, Tobin Tax, etc...) in a smart way. I'm also interested in ensuring that negative externalities are internalised as much as possible. I think one of the main issues is that some investment is made, risk and other externalities are splashed around, profit is extracted, then the capital buggers off without paying for whatever costs it has caused others to incur.

&gt; And you keep using the phrase 'distortion'. Operationally define it as you're using it.

This is the most interesting bit. It's about working out the value of things (and therefore how money is distributed in the economy). There are several ways to do it: 

1. Let the dictator/monarch decide.
2. Let democratically-elected politicians decide.
3. Let the free market decide.
4. Let science decide.
5. etc, etc, etc..

Speaking in neutral terms, each of these methods will choose different values for what things are worth. If you followed these, you'd end up with money being allocated very differently in an economy.

There is a prevalent argument that (3. Let the market decide) is the best, or the only, or the most ""efficient"" method, and that it's the only legitimate method. As I understand it, economists tend to focus on this one pretty heavily.

I tend to think that (4. Let science decide) would give us better outcomes in many cases. But *¿por qué no los dos?* - why wouldn't we use the market as the baseline mechanism for deciding value, augmented by evidence-based valuation where we know the market is weak (for example, on environmental valuation).

true,Ooftyman,UNSA,United States of America,"Don't confuse insurance-based healthcare with direct-payment (or 'fee-for-service') healthcare. I'm equally baffled when Americans and Europeans alike seem to believe the US has market-based healthcare. This is where the debates get rather convoluted because systems get equivocated. The US system is suffering from a rather poor incentive structure (largely due to the way employer-provided insurance was originally implemented).

Remember, this isn't a false dichotomy between simply public or private. The US federal government nearly 3x greater proportion of GDP into healthcare (through Medicare and Medicaid, etc) spending than the Brits. So the comparative debate suggesting American healthcare is disproportionately expensive because of markets simply doesn't hold water.

And, I don't mean to be nitpicky, but healthcare is not a 'public good' in the economic sense (non-rivalrous and non-excludable). That's the biggest reason why insurance based systems always perpetuate demand-derived-demand. Small co-pays and high premiums only ensure overuse and a strain on resources that would normally be governed by supply and demand. Put simply, market incentives are misaligned.

A rather spurious correlation, at best. Look to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. There was a time in American history when the Ohio River was so polluted that it went up into flames.

I have absolutely no problem with private property owners settling disputes over negative externalities in courts. If anything, I'd prefer such settlements take place out of courts (see: Coase).

&gt;Finally, the model does not support the argument that observed inverse-U-shaped pollution paths justify laissez-faire attitudes towards pollution, or that economic growth alone will solve pollution problems. Rather, we show that, absent environmental regulations, the pollution-income path may well have an inverse-U shape, but the amount of pollution at every income will be inefficiently high.

From the second:

&gt;The absence of appropriate microdata across countries has precluded a systematic empirical approach to this decomposition. However, the available evidence suggests that regulation is the dominant factor in explaining the decline in pollution as countries grow beyond middle-income status.

More recent articles do place [some aspects of the EKC into question](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X04000798) (also mentioned in the survey linked to above).

You *personally*, are being very generous with **other people's money**. 

Even with all the societal infrastructure and help, fortunes do not all magically occur (except in the financial sector). Some fortunes still need to be somehow **made**. And this does require work.

Now, only if all fortunes were being randomly distributed, regardless of work, would all economic inequality be a simple matter of fairness, in a ""*Hey, you gave him more than you gave me!*"" kind of way. But making a fortune can be a struggle in what feels like a kind of competition. This fortune is then often perceived (by the one making it) as his/her gold-medal. Don't be so eager to immediately have large chunks of it taken away, not if you want to be considered ""**just**"". 

It is so easy to be generous with other people's money, compared to being generous with **one's own**. So try giving away an amount that's just short of killing **you**, if you like. Or give away ""*50% of* ***your own*** *fortune to pay for the states debt*"". You see, that money **is** yours to dispose of as you see fit. Somebody else's money  ... **is not**.

That being said, I agree with a lot of what you wrote in the rest of your comment. Without sharing resources to organise societies, we would indeed live *short brutish lives*.

This being said, what do we do for « *le quatorze juillet* »? (Please note the French quotes and the required-in-French-typography lack of capitals)

Basically, we stay at home.

On the preceding day, many people party, since they don't have to get up and go to work the next morning. Many cities commission a firework display. It is traditional for the local fire station to organize a giant party on its premises known as « *le bal des pompiers*. »

On the morning of the 14th itself, there usually are military commemorations. The biggest one is organized on the *Champs-Élysées*, Paris' largest avenue, and includes major military units marching down the avenue and being reviewed by the President and assembled government. The high points of this « *défilé du quatorze juillet* » are the students of the *École polytechnique* who are the first to march down, the Paris fire brigade (a literal military brigade headed by a two-star general) who sports the biggest hangover of all the troops (see *bal des pompiers* earlier) and the *Légion étrangère* who march last following their bearded sappers.

Other cities also organize local marches. People either get out to watch the local march, or stay home and watch the national march in Paris on tv.

Then we just laze around for the rest of the day, just like ordinary Sundays.

As for visual aides, the tricolor flag seems a bit plain to my eyes. I guess that if you asked Frenchmen on a symbol for the *quatorze juillet*, they'd pick the famous Delacroix painting [*La Liberté guidant le peuple*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Leading_the_People).

French military units do very little public marches beyond the *quatorze juillet*, so a picture from the *défilé* would work too. You'll probably find a lot of Youtube videos on the marches or the *bal des pompiers*.

The first one will be around the Saint Germain's quarter and will be focused on bookstore and galleries.

It will include a stop at some Galleries of the Rue de Seine, maybe a visit at Musée d'Orsay if there is not too much people, a coffee at Les Editeurs (It is a be posh, and customers are often a bit haughty or arrogant, but it is still a good place.)

Then, I will go to have a look at the Comics/art book bookstore Un Regard Moderne, 10 rue Gît le Coeur. It is a real treasure.

I would also recommend Boulinier, for second-hand books and discs, Crocodisc, for second-hand vinyl discs or Gibert for second-hand books.

There is some movie theatres in rue Champollion, that show classic movies : Le Champollion, la Filmothèque and Le Reflet Médicis are all very good. The Café Le Reflet is also a good place.

None of this places are hidden secrets, but I always love to go and have a look at them.

**Marché des Enfants Rouges and its neighboorhood**

The second one will start near République in le Marché des Enfants Rouges, it is a food market, where you can buy take-away food from a lot of different places.

Then, I will mainly focus on the several museum and galleries that are present in the Marais, including le Centre Culturel suisse, le Musée Carnavalet, la maison de Victor Hugo, l'institut Suédois...

true,WorkingNinj,NORW,Norway,"Yeah, great. The following contains generalizations and bitterness: 

I've had partysvensker as neighbors, I've lost out on job opportunities because they'd rather hire swedish people that can work longer hours for less pay. I'm in no means blaming swedes for coming over and stealing our jobs and women, it's just sad that's all. I mean for me it all worked out, I moved country, I now work with a lot of swedish people (doing language work, don't worry england, not stealing your jobs, hell I'm not even stealing your men, he's not english). 

But, my mother for instance, she works in the hotel business and she says it's seldom they hire norwegian students to their hotel, they want cheap swedes, my mother tried renting out her flat and after weeks of saying she didn't want 7 swedes living in a two bedroom flat  afraid they would party in a quiet neighborhood she settled with a family who then went on to complain because the house two houses down had rented out had rented out their entire house to 10-15 swedish people working all day, partying all night and weekend. 


Again, I'm not blaming swedish people for this, you go on and work and party your hearts out, I would probably do the same if I were you. What I'm saying is that we keep making a big deal out of students that can't afford anything, can't get part time jobs. Young people out from uni in the same situation, I mean I got turned down at mc donalds, several of my best friends, I would say most have gone through the doors of NAV at one point or another. 


It's sad that the local businesses that can hire lots of people choose to hire working immigrants, and than think that swedes are practically norwegians anyway. It's not true. I could go on and say the same thing about polish workers. But I think I've made my point. It's great that swedish people have this opportunity to go over the boarder and work somewhere that pays much better than home, live for cheap with 6 friends and party all the time (generalization), but I guess I'm sort of envious and upset that norwegian youth don't have the same chance.  


One last point, I remember when I lived in oslo and the news made this huge deal about swedish people who worked sorting bananas or something, basically 7 hours sitting and sorting bananas and then the paper went on to say this is work norwegian kids would never do, meanwhile I was sitting in my flat loosing weight because all I could eat was noodles and homemade cheese pizza, I remember just being furious and others with me. They paint this picture of norwegian youth as entitled and too proud for ""shit work"", it's not true, I would have sorted the fuck out of those bananas. :p

Edit: Ah, there we go. Not surprisingly Swedish media does not mention the boys name. So, what has happened (all sources in Swedish): 

The parents decided to homeschool the child without state approval and oversight (this is required in Sweden in order to ensure the welfare of the child) and were sentenced to fines (~40USD) for every day the child was absent from school. This is the last resort for local authorities, and the parents refused to pay. [[1]](http://www.helagotland.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?articleid=5040833) 

Later on a court decided the child should be removed from his parents through LVU, the law for care of children, due to lack of physical and mental care and lack of education (the exact wording is ""isolation from learning""). LVU is a long and demanding process with extensive requirements of the court and social services before a child can be removed from his parents. [[2]](http://www.helagotland.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?articleid=5528308) 

The child was taken from them as they were preparing to move out of the country, and social services describe the incident as a failure on their part. This article also mentions the reason the parents did not want the child to go to school: He doesn't like ""stressful, noisy environments"".[[3]](http://www.helagotland.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?articleid=5436553) The decision was appealed to the European Court [[4]](http://www.helagotland.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?articleid=6110059) and the Judicial Ombudsman [[5]](http://www.helagotland.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?articleid=5440810) but nothing seems to have come of it. 

The father was later charged with kidnapping after taking the child and leaving during a visit. [[6]](http://www.helagotland.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?articleid=6523999)

TL;DR: Parents refuse to let child attend school. Parents do not fulfill requirements for homeschooling. The parents are issued fines but refuse to pay. Child is found to have suffered physically and mentally, and the education to be sub-par.

true,nickjomaffa,null,null,"I have been studying in Rome at Roma Tre University since September, I will be leaving in about a week. I come from an Italian background (my grandparents were Sicilian born) and have taken Italian courses in college for a few years so my opinion may be a little skewed because of that, but I think you will fit in fine here. People in shops, bars, restaurants, etc. can normally speak at least some English, so don't worry if you don't know any Italian. Even though you are an American tourist in the eyes of most Romans here, they typically don't care. In fact, they love it when you speak whatever little Italian you know to them, even if it is just ""Buon giorno! Come stai?"" It is more so that in other parts of Italy, from my experience, that Italians can be nasty to tourists (Venice, Naples, etc.). 

Your university is right by Trastevere, which is the best place to go for nightlife. There are plenty of bars and restaurants there in walking distance. Be wary, though, even though it's Italy, some places still have sucky food, but you'll quickly discover which places to avoid. As far as staying on budget, that can get a little tough where you are. My residence is in southern Rome in Garbatella, a little bit farther than walking distance from the city center (about an hour walk), so I can get lunch and dinner here for pretty cheap (1 euro pizza slices, 3 euro sandwiches, etc.). Trastevere is definitely more pricey than where I live, so us college students only go to dinner there when a professor or visiting parents pay for it. I am sure after doing some walking around, though, you'll find something affordable for food. Keep in mind the word bar here usually means a place for coffee and a quick snack (for breakfast or lunch), but it can mean a place for drinking. 

For transportation, it is 35 euro for a monthly pass that will allow you to ride the metro, buses, and trams, I recommend buying one each month. You will easily figure that out as well. Luckily I live right by a metro so it was very useful for me. Unfortunately, Trastevere is about a 20 minute walk from the closest metro stop (Circo Massimo), so you will probably be sticking to trams and buses mostly. The 23 bus is the one I take the most frequently, it goes along the Tiber River to the Vatican and back to southern Rome to San Paolo. There is a 23 stop right in front of Piazza Trilussa (the main entryway to Trastevere, pretty much, right by John Cabot University) going in the south direction to San Paolo, all you need to do is cross the river to get to the 23 stop that goes North to the Vatican. The 23 bus will help you quickly familiarize yourself with directions in Rome, at least relative from North to South. 

You will love your time here, especially if you're someone like me who loves walking outside to get around. Not to mention you will casually become acquainted with famous monuments such as the Colosseum. It is just so awesome to go for a  casual run down the Tiber River and see the Vatican, specifically St. Peter's Basilica or Castel Sant'Angelo, how many people get to do that on a regular basis? It very recently started getting cold, so going outside isn't as pleasant, but I'm sure it'll warm up for you very quickly when April rolls in. 

Hope this helps. You can always ask me for more information on anything specific that you're interested in. But I promise you, it will be the experience of a lifetime. ",0,1355396146,null,0,false,0,c7fw3nq,t3_149x8f,t1_c7fw3nq,t3_149x8f,null,1430661766,3,false,roma,t5_2t0su,3

Something about geography and size being important (which didn't seem to matter to the British Empire at it's height).

&gt;but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts

Which I can only take as a desire for a single government.  All the old territories that won their independence from the empire, they should all return to British rule because clearly, by definition, one whole is greater than many parts thus British rule everywhere?  This is empty rhetoric that could be used to justify almost anything.  Oh you're conquering France, whatever for?  Oh because the whole is greater than the sum of its parts therefore having one government rule the UK and France is the best solution for the French people, they'll thank me later I'm sure.

&gt;As for your last point, the British Empire was far more influencial and powerful than the US currently is, by comparison to its time.

A lively debate for the historians and one doomed to be bogged down in subjective definitions of 'power' and 'influence'.  The British Empire was certainly the largest in terms of land area, but they never quite had the power to vaporise billions of people in a few minutes.

&gt;On the world stage we have far more clout as a union rather than two individual states,

Finally a worthy point.  Though one that is difficult to justify. Consider, a hypothetical Scottish state would be entitled to more MEP's and have a chance at the rotating EU presidency.  Considering how closely England and Scotland are on most things this situation would effectively almost double our collective influence in the EU.  And if we aren't so close politically as that then where is right of London to represent their views as those of the Scottish people?

The rUK would still maintain its security council seat and Scotland would get it's own UN seat again with a chance of being one of the 15 non permanent members of the security council, essentially giving ourselves (England&amp;Scotland) more influence on the world stage in the form of more votes.

If you're already in France (especially with a job!), I don't see how the programme could be a benefit unless you want to become a teacher--I would like to stress that last point, because I think the only people who genuinely enjoyed the assistantship were those who are seriously considering teaching English as a career.

2. I was in my top *académie* choice (Aix-Marseille).  Most people I know got their first choice, but I met one or two--who were really well qualified!--who didn't get any of their top three.

3. It depended on the school and how organized they were. I worked with seven teachers, and only one of them had me work with her according to her curriculum. The others basically gave me a group of kids and said, 'Go!' The relationship with the students was pretty amicable; we were so close in age that it was perhaps less of a professional relationship than it should have been! That definitely made it easier to connect with them, though; since a lot of French teachers are such hardasses I think it made for a nice change. I was quite disappointed by my communication (or lack thereof) with the teachers. Most didn't even seem curious about the newcomer to the *salle des profs*. Even the ones I worked with expressed very minimal interest in what I was teaching their pupils.  This will not be your experience at every school, though! Many assistants had great relationships with their colleagues. You just don't know till you get there.

4. 12 hours/week. How those were arranged varied wildly. Some people worked only two days a week, but for most it was three or four days. I'm the only person I know who worked every day.

5. While I could have lived at the *lycée* for only 50€ a month (!), I decided to rent an apartment in a nearby city because I would've been desperately lonely. It was a good decision. I think that as long as you're not in Paris, you'll be able to find decent accommodation for under 400€/month, and that's before your [CAF](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caisse_d'allocations_familiales_\(France\)) money. It's easy to set up an account and most people got ~30-60% of their rent reimbursed.  That leaves you a decent amount left over for food, going out, and travelling. 

6. When I arrived, I had a a decent level of French but was really nervous about using it. My French did not approve at all from the assistantship, but only from interacting with people on a daily basis (and going out and making French friends!).

7. Nothing related to it.

Z.b. weil sie bei dem Eingriff eingegangen sind, ein bißchen mehr als die Vorhaut verloren haben oder - ganz trivial - einfach gerne unbechnitten geblieben wären.

true,evilpeter,HUNG,Hungary,"Public Corporations are mandated to make money. It is their amoral (not Imoral) purpose. When you buy stock, you are entering an agreement whereby you are investing in a company - buying a portion of that company - for the explicit purpose of making money. You may have other motives (wanting that particular type of business to succeed, as in green energy, for example) but your motives are irrelevant to the investment contract. 

The contract is a simple one. I will give you my money and you will use it to make me more money, and you will use it for no other purpose than to make me money so that I get a return on my investment. This is not nonsense and conjecture as you put it. it is fact.

sasp777 just gave you a perfect example in Enron - why did you dismiss it? If you want more examples, look up ""breach of trust"". Enron got in trouble because its executives used shareholder funds for something other than the explicit purpose of increasing shareholder value (and hiding it).  Legally, the only way public corporations are even allowed to give to charity, is by justifying the expense as increasing value through public relations. In enron's case, there would have been no LEGAL issue with executives buying 5000 personal shower curtains and giving themselves huge bonuses - but there's no way shareholders would have allowed those expenses as they could never possibly be justified to have a positive return on investment. If I have a private company, there is nothing stopping me from doing whatever I want with my money - but following the market crash of '29 laws were explicitly put into place to regulate corporations to 'tie their hands' to make sure that all funds are used to do nothing but make a profit.

As for your implication that CEOs must balace the effects of bad publicity vs monetary gains - um. No they don't. What planet are you on?  What bad publicity do you speak of? When was the last time you ever heard of somebody making a decision not to use a particular corporations services or products because they pay tax in an other country? If they are breaking the law, then that's a different story, but people throw around the word 'tax evasion' very loosely. There is a HUGE difference between tax evasion (which is illegal) and legally paying taxes in a different jurisdiction. Here's where I challenge YOU to find me just a single example that paying billions more in taxes by filing in the USA would even remotely outweigh any possible 'bad PR'.

It's always the government of the country with bad tax laws that bitches about it and tries to shame corporations and tries to get public opinion on its side - but the corporations are fully within the law.

In my business it's really hurting us and provides no benefits other than having acted as a proxy for getting venture capital 10-15 years ago. Investors don't fall for this anymore, there are better metrics than having useless patents. Useless because if you don't have a few thousand patents and millions of dollars for lawyers you can't play in the big leagues of lawsuits. I don't see how a system designed so that large corporate behemoths can destroy small competing startups can be positive for innovation.

Software companies had no problems making billions before patents infested the business. So in my limited world making money is a good enough motivation. Can the same be said about other businesses? I don't know. Although I do know that ideas are cheap, execution is almost everything.

Pharmaceutical research has managed to make the patent system work, so why not keep the system for them and have different systems for different businesses?

true,[deleted],null,null,"I guess you are not familiar with how the support for grassing animals are calculated. It is calculated with regards to (among other things) on *the land that it is being grassed*. Rather simplified, one receives more money if the animals feed on a field or a meadow, than in a ""forest like"" area. The animal can be out as much though, eat grass etc. 

Sweden/Finland among other countries, do not have as much fields and meadows, as some of the countries in mainland Europe. In fact, we have the opposite problem of the deforestated areas in much of Europe - we have far to much forrest. So, traditionally (which *should* be of importance to the EU since they care about about traditions and such), the few fields that we have are used for growing wheat, potaoes, etc. The animals were fed through ""skogsbete"", which is basically fed in areas which are not deep borealic forests, but by grassing in areas with a lot of low trees/bushes etc. That is still how it is done, and 2/3 of Sweden basically do not have any other way of feeding it's animals when they are going outdoors being fed- after all, most of Sweden is covered in forests.. 

Note however, that they are being fed, for as long as it is possible outside, and they are eating fresh grassand they can even be the same sort of cow. However, since the EU is saying that they are being fed in forestland -the farmer receives less. We do have the same costs though, if not more, since Sweden is one of the most expensive countries in the whole EU.  The EU has decided that a farmer that has cow that eats in forrests receives less. My question is why? Also, the EU classification of forest vastly differs from what actally is a forrest. Low bushes, etc, are counted towards ""forrests"", which, in combination with the natural Swedish field and meadows (who traditionally has a lot of bushes), leaves very few fields where the animals can feed, and the farmer can receive just as much money as the French farmers

[Here](http://www.rattvik.se/fabodar) for example, is a picture of what it might look like. Why are cows standing in the burning sun in a field worth more? 

Shouldn't the money be received on a) what you deliever - which is in this case, meat from a cow b) and how the cow has been treated/the quality. Is France claiming that our cows have less quality since there are more bushes where they eat? I'd *love* to see the scientific report for that. Could you send that to me?

2. I was in Mulhouse. I requested Alsace, so I got what I asked for, but I had been hoping for Strasbourg. Mulhouse was not the greatest place to live, but I ended up feeling at home eventually.

3. It really depended on each teacher. Some used me as a sort of cultural ambassador, giving a lesson on the American school system, for example. One teacher liked me to work with songs. Another teacher liked me to work with movies. Other teachers had me work with students one at a time to practice for oral exams. There were two groups I worked with informally and it was really up to me what to do with them. Sometimes it seemed like teachers brought me in because they just needed a break and would have students just ask me questions about anything. Most of the students were excited to work with me, especially those who were really into American culture. And I had an amazing relationship with my colleagues. I lucked out and they really made me feel like I was part of their family. We talked a lot in the teacher's lounge and they invited me to their homes throughout the year.

4. 12 hours a week. Some weeks a little more, some a little less. It all balanced out eventually. 

5. To avoid the hassle of finding an apartment, I lived in a room at the school. It was 80 euro a month, so I had plenty of money to live comfortably on a daily basis and to travel extensively on school breaks. My room was small and the man in charge of the internat was not the most pleasant, but overall it was fine and I liked not having to spend half my paycheck on rent.

6. I had studied French for 6 years at the University level before doing the program, so my level was relatively high. I noticed that I got more confident in my speaking, though, and I learned a lot of slang from the teachers and students.

7. Tried for a year to get a job that involved French to no avail. Now in my second year of a French PhD program.

8. I don't know how much of an impact the program will have on you if you're already living in France. I had only visited France twice before the program, so it was kind of a life-changing experience for me to live there. I happened to work with a fantastic group of teachers and some really excellent students, so overall I hold a high opinion of the program.

(b) The original statement is poorly defined and vague, meaning that any attempt to figure out if it's true is almost impossible.

true,Al_Gorithm,null,null,"&gt; Among non-experts, conventional wisdom holds that corporate law requires boards of directors to maximize shareholder wealth. This common but mistaken belief is almost invariably supported by reference to the Michigan Supreme Court's 1919 opinion in Dodge v. Ford Motor Co. 

&gt; **This Essay argues that Dodge v. Ford is bad law, at least when cited for the proposition that maximizing shareholder wealth is the proper corporate purpose. As a positive matter, U.S. corporate law does not and never has imposed a legal obligation on directors to maximize shareholder wealth.** From a normative perspective, options theory, team production theory, the problem of external costs, and differences in shareholder interests all suggest why a rule of shareholder wealth maximization would be bad policy and lead to inefficient results. 

&gt; Courts accordingly treat Dodge v. Ford as a dead letter. (**In the past three decades the Delaware courts have cited the case only once, and then on controlling shareholders' duties to minority shareholders**). Nevertheless, legal scholars continue to teach and cite it. This Essay suggests that Dodge v. Ford has achieved a privileged position in the legal canon not because it accurately captures the law - it does not - or because it provides good normative guidance - it does not - but because it serves professors' need for a simple answer to the question, What do corporations do? Simplicity is not a virtue when it leads to misunderstanding, however. Law professors should mend their collective ways, and stop teaching Dodge v. Ford as anything more than an example of how courts can go astray.

taxpayers, while EU tariffs mostly accounted for the €25.3bn cost to consumers.

The quote is from [this report](http://www.openeurope.org.uk/Content/Documents/Pdfs/CAP_2012.pdf), page 18.

&gt;Would that be justified by the difference in cost of living between countries, or is it even more than that? Because the cost of running a farm in France is much higher (in euros) compared to Romania.

No, not at all. For a lot of reasons. A - the French farmers  receive more than the Swedish for example, despite Sweden not being cheaper (rather more expensive I believe). B- If you look at page 15 in the report I linked to earlier, it very clearly deals with the fact that the countries who needs help the most, do not receive it. In fact, the whole CAP is geared towards the ""old"" states in the EU.The fact is, the suport is dealt out very arbitrary, and in no way geared towards those who needs it.

&gt; But that would go with reducing the countries' participation in the EU I imagine.


Exactly :-). To be serious, as long as the economy is run this way, I *do* want to lessen my countries involvment with the EU. If the EU cared about economy, it would show in the way they acted. It doesn't.

true,that_007,null,null,"&gt;Die Welt ist aber nicht schwarz und weiß, und deswegen gibt es den Gesetzgeber, der einen Ausgleich zwischen allen Interessengruppen herstellen soll. Das ist hier geschehen.

Nein. Das Baby hat ein Recht auf einen unversehrten Körper. Da gibt es nichts zu diskutieren. Es gibt kein legitimes Interesse der Eltern an der Verstümmelung ihrer Kinder. (Ein Ausgleich wäre übrigens gewesen, wenn der Gesetzgeber gesagt hätte: Verstümmelung ja, aber erst, wenn das Kind selbst entscheiden kann.)

&gt;Stellen wir die körperliche Unversehrtheit über alles, oder genehmigen wir unter Auflagen Familien, dass auch ihre Kinder in ihre Religionsgemeinschaft aufgenommen werden können?

Ersteres. 

&gt;Dabei ist doch die Frage des Ausmaßes des Eingriffes entscheidend.

Auch falsch. Ohne medizinische Indikation hat niemand an Babys herum zu schneiden. Egal ob es um die Vorhaut, die Schamlippen, das Ohrläppchen oder irgendeinen anderen Körperteil geht.

&gt;Wenn ein junger Mann in den nächsten Jahren der Meinung ist, seine Eltern hätten dieses Recht nicht gehabt, kann er damit sicherlich bis vor das Bundesverfassungsgericht gehen, um die Angelegenheit höchstrichterlich klären zu lassen.

Da müssen wir nicht auf einen jungen Mann warten. Dieses Gesetz, sofern es überhaupt vom Bundespräsidenten unterschrieben wird, wird garantiert vom BVerfG kassiert.

&gt;Das ist dann aber eine Frage der individuellen Betroffenheit, mir erschließt sich der Eifer nicht, mit dem sich Deutschland jetzt diesem Thema widmet.

Was bei der Anzahl deiner Beiträge hier erstaunlich ist...

The CAP  will also,  if France gets its way, not decrease in 2014-2020, instead France prefer that one cut down on R &amp; D, education, structural funds etc. To me that is economic madness, and at the same time, in damages those investments we *should* be making, in the future, to instead sponsor what is essentially 3 % of the population. 


&gt;France's net contribution to the EU budget, in relative as well as absolute terms, is higher than Sweden's and the UK's (by a lot), and pretty close to Finland too.

What the heck has that to do with not reforming the CAP. Are you saying that since *France* is a net contributor to the *EU*, the CAP shouldn't be reformed. If that is the way you reason - I suggest France bow down to its  overlords, Germany and Denmark then. Do you know what - they want to reform the CAP too, and with your reasoning, we should all listen to them. Well, France, why don't you? Start reforming then, they pay way more. I have absolutely no problems finding Danish or German people critsizing the CAP. 

And -the French *farmers* are not net contributors, in fact, they are net recipients, when they shouldn't be.

true,morneau33,ZUS,US,"1. Mostly positive. If I had had more control over a couple things, it could have gone better, but imperfect does not mean negative.

2. I was in a small town in Brittany (Rennes district). Brittany was my first choice for region, but if they had given me a choice of specific school, I would have chosen one in a bigger city where I could have people and had more things to do.

3. Teaching, of course. Other than that, because the schedule is only 12 hours per week, whatever you want. I did some on-line learning in all my free time. I joined the local badminton club. I didn't interact with students or colleagues much outside of class, except for 1 English teacher, which I suppose is my biggest regret. The teachers have a full schedule, so you don't see them a whole lot because they're busy in class. I didn't think about it until I returned to the US, but I realized that I should have sat in on a French history course, both as a way to practice French, and as a way to learn more about the country. If I were allowed to go back and change just one thing, it would be to sit in a French history class.

4. Variable per position. Most of the school year, I only worked 4 days per week, but my teachers ended needing to switch schedules so often, I'm not sure if I ever had the exact same schedule in consecutive weeks. Might have just been a quirk of my school.

5. The school had an apartment for me (which I had to pay for). The lifestyle on that income was very simple. My teaching money essentially just covered rent, food, internet, and the occasional bus fare. Travel around the country and rest of Europe came out of savings.

6. I was a French minor, so it was fairly good. I think I scored ""Advaced-High"" on some proficiency test in college. People I met frequently complimented me on my French, but I wanted to get fluent. It's hard to quantify improvement, so I'll just say I saw ""moderate improvement"". I could have put more effort into it, as about the most rigorous thing I did was to check out a couple of short novels from the school library. Again, I was in a small town, and it was a hassle for me to get somewhere to find French people to speak with. Being in a larger city would have easily changed this.

7. This has been the worst part. I actually had to leave the program early and unexpectedly, so did not have a job lined up when I got back to the US, and have fallen into the awful ""don't have a job so can't get a job"" cycle.

8. This depends on the person. Like I said, I wish I had sat in on a course, but maybe that's not your thing seeing as how you've lived there for awhile. Definitely join Couchsurfing.org if you have not already. Aside from being able to travel around Europe and have free accommodations while meeting interesting people, I made my French friends through a local Couchsurfing get-together. This was one of the only settings in which I could comfortably practice my French (in most other settings, people would speak English upon my first mistake in French, which didn't always work out for the better).

Secondly if they are leaving the country, why stop them? Obviously they care immensely about their own child, if it is a question of quality of life, how do we reconcile our view of 'proper' parenting with the rights of the parents to educate their children. I.e. if we were to judge people's right to parent by their ability to educate, then wouldn't we be removing a lot more children from their parents?

Once again, I appreciate the looking in on the Swedish side... From a non-speaker it's incredibly difficult to find the entire story.

It's extremely similar to the house of Lords. The lords are appointed by the executive. They are not voted on. I don't agree with the lords system fully, however I think the principle of appointing rather than electing is an excellent one. You elect people to represent your interests and those people then determine who is intelligent enough to fill the second chamber of parliament. You could argue that it is not like the house of Lords because the lords are appointed by the executive where as this is the other way around. The legislature appoints the executive. 

Ultimately it comes down to if you're ok not **directly** electing your representative. I and many others are ok with that. I even think it's a very good idea. You can argue that the EU commission (however not the entire EU) is unelected and you'd be sort of right. However you can't argue that it's not democratic because it's still the people who the citizens voted for who have all the power. You have right to be uncomfortable with not directly electing the EU's executive, however it makes me feel safer knowing that smarter men (and women) than myself are deciding.

&gt;Is this referring to Turks? From what my German friends and family tell me this is a very large problem, with many different nationalities not wanting to integrate into the German system but mainly Turkish people. I live in Oregon which is on the far west coast of the U.S. we have similar issues with people from Mexico.

yeah pretty much. i dont actually know anyone who is working in a kindergarten in the city, so i cant really give you any more details. its no secret that its a problem in schools though. anyhow, shouldnt be too hard to get a job in a smaller town, since your german is apparently good.

just looked up an article on the issue: [http://www.zeit.de/2012/36/Migranten-Kinder-Sprachfoerderung](http://www.zeit.de/2012/36/Migranten-Kinder-Sprachfoerderung)

sum-up: kids speak turkish at home, Erzieher arent really competent in early language training (they also are paid pretty badly considering they had a 5-year Ausbildung), often kids with immigration background wont even get a place in a KiTa (different in the respective federal states). 

fyi, KiTa = Kindertagesstätte = day care center. basically a kindergarten, afaik the main difference is that children stay there for the whole day and that younger children are visiting it, too.

There are several ways things could pan out over the next century and NI doing it's own thing, ideologically at least, looks to be the best option to me.

A) ""Catholic"" percentage goes above half way, SF or SDLP call for a referendum on reunification, the majority pass it, civil unrest resurgence from the loyalist / unionist side of things. Back to square one.

B) ""Catholic"" percentage goes above half way, SF or SDLP call for a referendum on reunification, the majority dismiss it on economic grounds rather than tribal affiliation. (Just as likely) Status quo remains. Republican / nationalist minority rail against this, call people traitors for how they voted / talk about how the south / other nationalists and so on abandoned them, further marginalizing themselves from the rest of NI and Ireland and leading to a resurgence in civil unrest. Also not healthy.

C) ""Catholic"" percentage goes above half way, SF or SDLP call for a referendum on reunification, second question added to include full autonomy / independence as NI identity has grown strong in spite of old tribal affiliation. People see themselves as ready to determine their own future without the crutch of Ireland or the UK.

Either way, I don't think it looks good for unionism in the look run. I think most of us in the south at this point see NI as something we have no say in since the GFA and I totally see why people think of NI as being culturally different now. I think it's foolish to think otherwise since the historical fork of partition. I wouldn't take offence to this either, people from Cork see themselves as ""other"" to Dubliners and so on.

Er...okay. Not sure I have a great deal to say to you since your attitudes towards workers are evidently so contemptuous.  But, to the extent we're talking about automation and efficiency gains, remember that those systems were invented by workers, designed by workers and produced by workers - your precious ""wealth creators"" had nothing to do with it.  So who should get the benefits?  Of course, under a global capitalist system, there's always the risk of a race to the bottom, and unionisation has to reflect this global perspective, but if we increasingly build legitimate economically democratic business entities and require sufficient transparency, you'll be surprised how quickly they'll find markets and cripple exploitative authoritarian ones.  If you think that, as more and more well-educated ""middle class"" workers are unable to find work in automated production systems, as professions are destroyed, an increasing sense of solidarity won't develop, I think you may be in for a surprise.  Historically, there were other options for people who retrained, increasingly there are not.  

As for the outsourcing of work to the developing world, this only works because of investment in massive military machines to subordinate whole nations and corrupt their administrations, to force in to place ""free"" trade agreements, to enforce artificial scarcity though patent and copyright treaties, to prepare the substrate for corporate domination.  As Friedman puts it: ""The hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist. McDonald's cannot flourish without McDonnell Douglas, the designer of the F-15. And the hidden fist that keeps the world safe for Silicon Valley's technologies to flourish is called the US Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.""

Positive/Negative- The negative was I wanted to be in the Basque country which became a curse because I applied to be a primary teacher and there were no primary teachers placed in the Basque Country so they stuck me in the middle of nowhere with only 6,000 people in the town (Souston, Les Landes). I couldn't find cheap enough rent so they had to move me. I was placed in a larger town (Dax, Les Landes) near by and since the cost of transportation was just outrageous to the small town they cancelled my contract and I was placed in three new schools. Because I was a late arrival to the new town (and there were already 6 assistants there, 2 other primary English assistants) I was put in schools really far away from the housing that I had (I was placed in 4 schools which sucked), which is a dorm for medical students who were doing their internship at the local hospital. It took me forever to get to and from my schools and I had to walk two miles to one of my schools (the one I only taught at once a week) since the bus line didn't go that far out. Dax had no people my age (except the other assistants) and all the medical students were busy as crap and never could hang out and I actually the whole 9 months I was there only had seen 4 whole people in the residence hall that I lived in.

Positive- the other assistance were there and Dax is a main train line and only 4 hours from Paris and 1 hour from Bordeaux. 

2. I requested the Bordeaux Académie so I got my first choice. My second choice was Lille and then 3rd Reims. I wanted Lille to be my second choice cause I was an exchange student in Belgium in High School and love that country to death.

3. Since my schools were so far apart I didn't really get to interact with my colleagues as much as I would have liked because I was constantly waiting for a bus and traveling to my next school. It was literally a pop in pop out type of deal.

4. Everyone is scheduled 12 hours a week but really with the bus schedule and everything I was out the door by 8 and never in the door before 5pm everyday, except Fridays when I only worked in the morning.

5. I was lucky that when they moved me to Dax they had already set up housing for some of the other assistants at a resident hall for medical students, so that was actually really nice. I lived in a small loft with a bathroom and kitchenette. It cost like 325€ a month and even less with the CAF (though I don't know if they have this anymore). I was able to travel to Spain, Belgium (3 times), Paris (10+ times), Bordeaux, Amsterdam, Rome, Milan, Athens, Istanbul, England, while there, by surviving on baguettes and brie. I must warn you that you need a good $3,000 before going at least cause you will have all these unexpected costs and it may take your académie forever to actually pay you (it's worse in the Spain program).

6. I was almost completely native like in French when I arrived as I had done an exchange program in high school in Belgium and had a degree in French by the time I arrived.

7. During that program I applied to the Spanish equivalent and the next year taught English is Mallorca, Spain. The Spanish program is so much better but I think it's because I like Spaniards more than the French and maybe expected the French to be like Belgians (which they aren't, Belgians are like the most amazing Europeans ever). I loved the Spanish program and learned to speak Spanish and Mallorquin (Catalan) as I taught in small towns but lived in the major city of Palma. I'm currently finishing up a master's in linguistics anthropology and applying to PhD programs.

I wonder would it be in NI's economic interests, as a devolved or independent country to mirror the Isle of Man.

To us, Europeans, it feels like this is a type of discrimination: as we grow up, boys and girls grow up and play together, and have common activities as adolescents.

true,adamkex,SWED,Hungarian in disguise,"&gt; No offence but state provided or subsidized jobs worsen the problem, not fix it. If the economy needs engineers, business majors, doctors, lawyers, researchers, etc.. Then you need those people, not people without education. You also has to take into account that for almost any profession, you need a vocational degree which take 2-3 years time to study when you already have basic education. You only set immigrants to fail if you don't understand this.

That's your opinion. Of course countries need those people with that education. With that attitude you're implying you should only accept refugees with certain educations, while there are few refugees with that type of education, many times their university isn't recognized because it can be dodgy. I've met several who redid their education for that reason.

&gt; There big differences between countries. You make it sound like that there is no difference between Saudi-Arabia and Sweden. In reality there is. In reality there are huge differences between cultures in case of individual freedom and gender equality. For crying out loud we didn't know term honour killing before there was immigration from middle-eastern countries that put much more emphasis on honour and family than individual centric western cultures.

Of course, there is no difference at all in between Sweden and Saudi Arabia /s. Honor killings are rare. How many women and men have died because of that in Sweden (or Finland)? Suicide rates are high in Sweden, I'm too lazy to check the statistics for Finland but I wouldn't be surprised if they are similar to Sweden. Obviously cultures are different, but culture is so many things. Like food, religion, holidays, tradition. It's not just honor killings. Also why is it wrong to have a culture based around honor and family as long as it doesn't go against the law? Our way is not the only way.

&gt; You are very ignorant of your own cultural history. Nordic countries have always been very individualistic. This can very much be contributed to the fact that Nordics have been full of small independent farmers and for every new generation there has been wilderness to take and claim. This individualism was even more amplified by Storskiftet that divided village communities all over Sweden-Finland to small independent farms. Not to mention there has been long history of having a independent justice system where even peasants could have appealed to the king if they have felt that they have been wrongly judged. This is very unique in the world..........

I'm talking about individual freedom. For many years we've had absolute monarchies, dictatorships (if you consider them different). When could everybody, not just men or the influential, vote for the first time? Sweden abolished the state church not very long ago. We still are not a republic. Universal Suffrage is historically new. Also I'm not interested in putting culture into numbers and comparing. I've never said all cultures are the same.

&gt; Minorities can do what they want with their money, if they want to build their shrine, then that is their prerogative. However the Finnish state will expect that your children learn Finnish, they go to school that will instill state sanctioned values and beliefs that will make them able to function in the society and with good luck help them abandon ways that have no place in modern society.
And again, you can be Jew, Muslim or Christian, but if you are in Finland, then you better be Finnish, that is only thing that counts.

If there is a large minority in a certain commune who pay a lot of tax and they have religious needs then a request should be seriously considered. They pay tax and also they vote in the commune. Also it's easy political points. Of course everybody who lives in Finland should learn Finnish. I've never said anything else. In Sweden there are different requirements to vote in local election, you either have to be Swedish, EU citizen including Norway and Iceland, or have lived in Sweden for 3 consecutive years and have a permanent residency. Personally I would have no problems what so ever with having a Finnish church built here with government funding (assuming the Church of Finland can't afford it which is unlikely. Same apples for any place of worship if there is high enough demands. It's better than a Saudi oil baron funding an ultraconservative Wahhabist or Salafist mosque.

The children should decide themselves if they want to consider themselves Finnish or not, it's up to them if they want to believe in Finnish values. Some people consider themselves multinational, it is possible to be Swedish and Finnish (and not Finlandssvensk), or Finnish and American, or Finnish and Turkish. The state should never tell you want to think, this isn't 1984. Also there are people here who say you can't be Swedish and Muslim because Islam hasn't had its presence here until recently. I wouldn't be surprised of there are some Finns who would say the exact same thing.

&gt; Finnic people have inhabited Finland for thousands of years, ever since the last ice age can Finnish track their lineage here. Ever since those times the people and their society have been under development. There was Finnish people and nation long before the independence.
What goes to economic development, when Finland became independent, it was one of the poorest nations in Europe, in less than 100 years the country has become one of the richest countries in the world. Under that time there has been one civil war, wars with USSR and Germans, and loose of big areas of country, and resettlement and rebuilding periods. This country isn't rich because it has natural richness, not because of infrastructure, but how its people form society and how they interact with each others. People make country rich.
And to remind you, nobody forces people to come Finland. This is our country, this is our way of life, if you want to become Finnish and work for it, then there are opportunities for that, but you are not welcomed here permanently if you don't want to become part of us.

Finland's civil war wasn't long after its independence iirc. Finland was very strong in WWII which I admire a lot. Post WWII Finland was a democracy and had no wars. The political system worked and there was a lot of fear from the red threat. What middle eastern country except for Israel can say that if you replace the red threat with its Arab neighbors? Its people are oppressed and its dictators only care about power. You've got the UAE which is relatively liberal compared to the majority of the countries in the region and are very rich because of its oil and its leader wanting to improve the country. There are no doubts that many countries in that region would develop a lot faster if they would allow their people to. Also I'm sure companies like Nokia would welcome anyone with the right expertise for as long as they could keep him, they wouldn't give a rat's ass if he didn't want to become Finnish as long as he stayed.

&gt; In primary school if you live in an area with high concentration of Finnish, you will start your school with Finnish, but you will then move to use only Swedish in school. In time you will become completely Swedish because you are absorbed by Swedish culture and the way of life. You may know how to talk your parents native language, but doesn't make you Finnish, just somebody who knows how to speak Finnish.

You can't speak for everybody. I'm multinational and I've lived in different countries. Swedish is my primary nationality. However I'm a lot less Swedish than many other people in my country.

That's called Science. We must be rational here.

&gt; Does any black country have a military stronger than France's?

How do you define ""military stronger""? We could use a simple definition of ""beating France in a conflict"". In which case, yes, Algeria won their war of independence from France.

However ""military strength"" is not the be all and end all, and is not the most important thing, so it **doesn't matter about military strength**.

&gt; Has there been a black civilization anywhere near as prosperous as European civilization?

Has any spanish speaking country been near as prospoerous as the rest of europe? By your definition, the spanish-speaking world is inferiour! Bomb Madrid!

Mostly those assistants were having us study articles or songs, playing games they had brought with us, explaining things about the english-speaking world... I have positive memories of it, and it was fun for us and for the assistants. The best assistants were those who tried to have everyone participate and who were trying to have us do something everyone would be interested in. Also I think the teachers were giving advice to them on what activities they should pick.

Also I don't think you can make much progress in french by being a language assistant as teachers want you to forbid the students to speak in french.

A company is a social and legal construct designed for making profits, and the only people a company is ultimately going to have to answer to is their chairholders.

It is not very productive calling me obsessed either

&gt;I never said that the CAP was perfect, and, yes, I believe it is unfair that the newest countries are treated differently than the ""historic"" countries.

So, why is France trying their hardest to *continue* this unfairness. France is the only big country blocking it, and the only net contributor (Italy is keeping silent). Why? By doing this France is contributing to the unfairness, and wanting to keep it up. Why?


&gt;However France is the largest country of the EU

By a not that much, compared to Spain and Sweden, Poland, Germany and Finland for example. Finland and Sweden together is far bigger than France. If size is everything, I bet we can get Sweden/Poland/Finland/Germany to join up and thus, we should be able to decide more. The fact is, when it comes to the CAP most countries are in favour of a reform, geograhically, population wise - no matter how you count it, so it is also very undemocratic to block it. 

&gt;However France is the largest country of the EU, and it is also one of the countries with the highest ratio of agricultural land, so it's only logical that we receive a lot of subsidies.

No, not really. I am not saying one  shouldn't receive any, or the CAP should stop immediately but the subsidies are specifically tailored towards France. For example a French farmer receives more money for the exact same cow, being brought up in the same way, than a Swedish farmer. France have refused that particular reform at least since Sweden joined, in 1995. Why have you done that?


&gt; Most big farmers get a lot of subsidies, but a very large number of small farmer get almost nothing.

Just like any country. We are all dealing with that, not just France.


&gt;I don't agree either when you say they shouldn't be, the whole idea of the CAP is to subsidize farmers.

Well, that is not what is happening. And, the whole idea behind the CAP  is not to randomly subsidize western european farmers, in an arbitrary way but that is happening now. 

Take a look at [this](http://www.openeurope.org.uk/Content/Documents/Pdfs/CAP_2012.pdf) report for example. Page 15, graph 6. Do you see how unfair it is? Do you really think that one of the top receipients,  France, needs money that much more than the Czech republic for example? And, do you also need money much more than Germany and Italy pretty big countries themselves, who are net contributors. If so, why do you need the money much more? Also, I guess this answers your question about French farmers receiving more than they are giving. 

If I may also direct your attention to fact that one of the reasons of the CAP is to direct money to *those who need it the most*. In other words, a poor country like Romania should receive relatively more than a rich country, like Germany for example. But France is always on the receiving list, sometimes even receiving more. How come? 

To sum it up - 44 % of the budget goes to an unfair, arbitrary, ineffective money draining machine, that actively works against fair trade, helping those who needs it, spending money fairly and redirecting money sensibly. For example, a quote from the report says:

&gt;""Lithuania, whose farmers are the poorest in Europe in
absolute terms, receives the third least from the scheme. In contrast, wealthier member states such
as Ireland and France continue to do well out of the CAP""

The biggest obstacle to changing the CAP, the country that always defends it, is France. It is counterproductive, unfair and expensive - why are you doing this. France is hurting the EU by doing this - we are cutting down on R &amp; D, education and development, yet France is refusing to cutting the CAP. Why?

The translations may not add to the complexity for the company - in terms of steps it has to take itself when applying for a patent - but it does makes the entire bureaucratic process more complex as a whole. Each translation is like the layer of an onion; with enhanced cooperation, you are left with 3 translation-related layers before the patent can be granted in all 27 member states. And the part about cost is simply not true. Could you point me to where you are getting this from?

&gt;This has not become easier. It's still exactly the same process at the issuance stage.

It's exactly the same process, but you only have to do it *once* for the decision to be valid in the 25 participating member states, instead of 25 times in the current system. This isn't even touching upon the fact that national courts can reach different decisions about a patent - a flaw which is effectively destroyed in the new system.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Ich habe irgendwie das Gefühl das diejenigen die sich gegen die Beschneidung aussprechen in der Regel unbeschnitten sind. [...] Es müssten doch gerade Mittglieder dieser religiöser Gruppen dagegen sein.

Um mal klarzustellen dass das kein wirkliches Argument ist: dasselbe durfte man vor ein paar Jahrzehnten auch noch über die körperliche Züchtigung sagen ohne schief angeguckt zu werden. Und es gilt mancherorts auch für die weibliche Genitalverstümmelung und die Unterdrückung der Frauen an sich. Disclaimer: Das soll nicht heißen dass alles ""gleich schlimm"" ist - es soll nur zeigen dass dein Argument Bullshit ist.

&gt; Haben den Muslime und Juden kein Recht dagegen zu protestieren? Sie wurden doch auch als Säuglinge beschnitten.

Protestieren kann man viel, aber das heißt noch nichts. Es gibt durchaus (Muslime und) Juden die sich auch in der Familie Druck machen, selbst wenn es nicht um ihr eigenes Kind geht - aber ganz ehrlich, viele halten sich auch zurück weil sie nicht als vermeintliches Arschloch dastehen wollen. Ebenso gibt es (Muslime und) Juden die ihre Kinder nicht beschneiden lassen. (Ja, ernsthaft. Mehr Protest ist schon Aktionismus.)

&gt; Jetzt bitte nicht das Argument das muslimische oder jüdische Gemeinden jemanden ausschließen wenn sich jemand negativ gegen welche Normen äußert.

Hatte ich eigentlich nicht vor, aber ernsthaft: Warum denn nicht? Wie sonst halten sich umstrittene Traditionen wenn nicht über institutionalisierten Druck? Wer familiär oder wirtschaftlich von seiner Gemeinde abhängig ist oder seine Freundschaften innerhalb dieser für wichtiger erachtet, ist ein billiges Ziel.

Und um es mal klarzustellen: Es gibt durchaus Opposition auch innerhalb jüdischer Gemeinschaften. Auch Religionen passen sich den Zeiten an. Die Mitzwa zum Schabbat stand beispielsweise mal neben den Mitzwot gegen Götzendienst, Unzucht und Mord praktisch eine Stufe höher als die Mitzwa zur Jungenbeschneidung, ist von diesem Platz aber aus praktischen Gründen runtergeflogen. Seitdem darf die Mitzwa zum Schabbat bei Lebensgefahr auch gebrochen werden. Ebenso wie die Mitzwa zur Jungenbeschneidung. Und dies wird auch regelmäßig gemacht.

Die Briss als expliziter und einziger Bund? Sind Frauen dann gottlos? Auch der Schöpfer hat sich mal geirrt, und das sogar zugegeben als er statt der Erstgeborenen den Stamm Levi quasi zur spirituellen Kaste machte.

Da guck ich gern auf die Charedim, die verlangen auch noch die Metzitzah Bapeh, welche heutzutage eher als barbarisch und widerlich empfunden wird - und die Diskussion bringt auf Seiten der Befürworter einer expliziten Legalisierung auch dieselben Argumente vor wie hier bei der Diskussion um die Briss an sich. Soviel Tragikomik ist schon fast klischeehaft.

Es ist kein Zufall dass sich dort wo sich Individuen und Familien von ihren Gemeinden und dem Druck nach gesellschaftlicher Konformität lösen (oder alternativ liberaleren Gemeinden beitreten) können auch Alternativen zur Tradition entwickeln die durchaus das Zeug haben selbst einmal Tradition werden zu können. So beispielsweise der Friedensbund (Brit Schalom). Bitte nicht lachen, ist ja nur ein Beispiel.

Und auch wenn du es wahrscheinlich nicht wahrhaben möchtest zeigt sich am breiten Spektrum der Gegner und Unterstützer dieser neuen Interpretation des göttlichen Bundes über konservatives und progressives Judentum hinweg, dass es nicht nur bei der Opposition sondern auch bei der Unterstützung der (gemäßigt) traditionellen Briss weniger um religiösen denn gesellschaftlichen Disput geht.",0,1355442553,null,0,false,0,c7g7mlh,t3_14rzrh,t1_c7g7mlh,t1_c7g66ry,null,1430667280,2,false,de,t5_22i0,2
