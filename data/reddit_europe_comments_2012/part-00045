*Come on*.  The famine was exacerbated by various landowners sending food back to the mainland instead of using it to feed the poor, and the lack of action on the part of the British government, but to claim that there was no failure of Irish agriculture is ridiculous.

For a start, Ireland was dependent on the potato crop, both to feed the Irish themselves, as an export good, and as a livestock food, to a ridiculous degree.  This is why a single disease in a single plant had such a massive impact.

Second, Ireland, for whatever reason, had gotten into a tradition of parcels of land being split into smaller and smaller chunks, as land was passed on from fathers to sons.  In 1845 a quarter of all Irish farmers owned land 0.4-2 hectares in size, with another 40% owning land 2-6 hectares in size.  The eventual effect of this is obvious: soon the majority are going to be in possession of land so poor that it's nay-impossible to grow anything.  So yes, the Irish famine (of which there were a great many before the Great Famine) was partly caused by a failure in Irish Agriculture.

So I was really surprised to see many fat young women chugging beer just like the boys, getting so drunk that they lose their shoes in the winter and go home barefoot in the icy sidewalk... etc. Feeling no shame at all.

&gt;But the real problem – which the delegates in Brighton must tackle head on – is that the court was never supposed to be a substitute for national protection of human rights.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think you see it as a class struggle between rich and poor. I see things as good incentives vs. bad incentives. So there are two different ways of ""moving right"" - moving towards the class interest of the rich or moving towards good incentives and productivity. I mean the second of course and not much happened on that front.

The problem with progress towards the left is ignoring incentives and assuming away human selfishness. The slogan of socialism is ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"". This assumes people are unselfish and work according to ability even when it is not motivated by personal gain, and don't manufacture needs. And this is not true. This why progress towards the left doesn't work, this is why the compassion that is the characteristic of the left must always be balanced with tough incentives which is the characteristic of the free market.

So let's go step by step.

Corporate subsidies are no a free market policy. How could you even think so? They are simply a different kind of socialism, for the rich. They represent moving right as the class interest of the rich and not as towards a free market and good incentives.

Bank bailout - same thing, not free market but socialism for the rich. Very bad incentive.

Corporate taxes are paid by humans anyway, so it does not matter. In fact I even see it as an unnecessary intermediate step. Why do we even need that? If someone spends that profits we can tax it as VAT. If it is reinvested, why tax it?

Unions try to protect the interests of their members but they do not represent the interests of the whole economy nor even the whole working class. For example they generate unemployment by pushing wages higher than the level where the market clears, hence low-productivity people (young people for example) are priced out of the job market.

Worker hours have to be going up because too few people work. I mean in the private sector. Here in Austria 2 million people working in the private sector try to feed another 7 million - retired, on welfare, or government payroll. Either they have to work harder or what should be more ideal another 1-2-3 million people should be thrown out from the teats of government and into the productive private sector. That would be better but the retired are an important electorate so the government s just squeeze the workers. But anyone something like that must be done, can't you see that? Fewer and fewer wealth-creating private sector workers cannot support more and more dependents forever. Ideally almost everybody but the disabled and very elderly should work and preferably in the private sector. 

And the reason they don't is regulation. Generally on a free market supply and demand does clear somewhere. Maybe too low level, but it clears.

The basic problem is a huge, embedded electorate of the non-productive: retired, welfare, government payroll. So of course the few remaining productive people get squeezed more.

Ultimately the whole thing must crash at some point and there will be no choice but to return to the simple incentives of the free market: each gets what he produces.",0,1334830257,null,0,false,0,c4e3j2t,t3_se1ka,t1_c4e3j2t,t1_c4dsonx,null,1428753095,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Ehrlich gesagt, weiß ich gar nicht, wie Leute genannt werden, die gegen Zigeuner sind, weil die angeblich alle klauen würden.

Schwarze zum Beispiel sind in den USA überproportional häufig im Gefängnis. Ein Rassist würde behaupten, dass Schwarze deshalb Verbrecher sind. Weil sie häufig im Gefängnis landen.

Es heißt, dass Amerikaner überproportional patriotisch wären. Ein Anti-Amerikaner würde behaupten, dass sie deshalb jeden Präsidenten wählen, der sie in Kriege hinein führt.

Es geht nicht um Patriotismus, vermeintliche Kriegslust oder dergleichen. Es geht um die konkreten Vorurteile. Sie sind austauschbar. Und deshalb unbesiegbar.

It stands to reason that when judges (who are human) are left to interpret laws and  court rulings there will be biases - as opposed to when there is legislation which states that they have to follow and upholding certain principles.

You dont need to only look at court rulings and the sentences given to reach that conclusion.   We don't  have a constitution that upholds individual rights.  A middle class person can not afford to get justice in the  UK courts and legal aid has been cut back.  

Please  dont tell me that our justice system is objective.   The laws we have were made by property owners and the ""upper"" classes to protect their (property) interests.  


&gt;my direct question about whether you disagree out of principle in allowing elected governments to maintain a supervisory role of the ECHR.

I think the people should elect the who supervises the courts - the courts  should represent the  people and principles of justice and objectivity - not the governments.

So presumably, if you first filed a case with the ECJ and their ruling is negative, you could then take the case to the German consitutional court, arguing that you were not adequately protected by European institutions.

You have early trains (RER, line B) that leave from the center of Paris that can get you there by 6:00, but I don't think it's safe to just have 40 minutes to check-in and take your plane. Once you arrive in CDG, you will still have to walk a bit (~10 minutes, maybe more if you don't know the airport).

Also that would mean you have to be at 05:20 at a RER B station in Paris, but if your hostel is not right next to it, itcan get complicated (metro lines that can take you there do not start as early as the RER so you would have to take a taxi or a night bus).

Finally, delays are quite common on the RER B (usually not so early in the morning, but you never know, and there's quite often a technical problem at the Gare du Nord station which is on the path), so taking the 06:40 plane is really risky.

There are also buses that can get you to CDG (Roissybus and Air France buses), but I don't think they start so early.

You have night buses (they're called Noctilien) leaving from the Gare de l'Est station (see [here](http://www.aeroportsdeparis.fr/ADP/en-GB/Passagers/Access-maps-car-parks/Paris-CDG/Access/public-transport/paris_charles_gaulle_noctilien.htm)), but keep in mind that there's usually only one bus every 20 or 30 min, and depending on were you stay, you may still have to take one or several other night buses to get to Gare de l'Est. (Metro stops at about 01:30 on Fridays)

My best advice if you want to take the plane at 06:40 would be to take a taxi from Paris to CDG (there's not much traffic at this hour).

The best place to take a taxi is the closest big train station or place next to where you stay (Chatelet, Gare du Nord, Montparnasse, Saint-Lazare, Denfert-Rochereau, etc.). If you stay at the hotel, you can ask them to book you a taxi for when you want to leave.

Otherwise, I recommend using ""[les Taxis Bleus](http://www.taxis-bleus.com)"" or ""[Taxis G7](http://www.taxisg7.com/)"". Those are two taxi companies from which you can book a taxi. They will pick you up at the address you give them, and drive you to the destination of your choice. That's what I use when I know I will need a taxi.

Yes, we do have a rather special sort of constitution. It's evolved over a long, long time - back to the Magna Carta at least. As with a lot of evolved things it's quite well-adapted although you wouldn't have designed it like that from scratch. A bit like the eye. But I'm buggered if I'm going to let you fiddle with my eyes because you have a whizzy idea for rearranging my retina, and similarly I'm not terribly keen on someone mucking about with a finely-tuned constitution.

&gt;*I still believe that all the cuts in their severity (and the general drive to put important government duties in private corporate hands) are not good - not for society, and probably also not for the economy in the long run.*

No, you dont grill sauerbraten, but you do soak it in vinegar and pretty much destroy the taste of the meat. 

To be clear, by BBQ, I mean *BBQ*, the flesh of angels from heaven slow roasted by a 80 year old black man applying homemade sauce with a sock on a wire coat hanger. $6 a plate at the Church picnic with a side of collard greens (mangold)  and cornbread. To me, BBQ is a whole fucking pig that has been slow roasted for 18 hours resulting in an orgasm for your face hole.

I have found that, in Germany BBQ means ""to barbecue"" *Grillen*: anything from bauspeck to mini wurstchen cooked outside on any type of grill contraption is ""BBQ"". Electric grills are the ""lite beer"" of Germany. I find it incomprehensible that a nation that designed the Leopard tank, cant make a fucking grill. I laugh at *GrillSeason*

BBQ *sauce*, which I think is what you are confusing BBQ for, is merely an attempt to provide a condiment that imitates the flavor of BBQ. Do people use too much? Yes, but only because its amazing.

.... I mean this in a nice and friendly way, your comments prove my point. BBQ, does not exist in Germany, nor do Germans know what it is.

That being said, Germany has some amazing food.

Difficulty of learning a second language is hugely dependent on how closely related it is to your first language.

Moreover, English and Swedish are both Germanic languages (Swedish from the Northern Germanic branch, English from the West Germanic branch).  The two languages are more similar than either is to say, Russian.  I would also suggest that as difficult as Mandarin may be for most speakers of European languages, there are undoubtedly harder languages; Basque springs to mind.

Almost the entire thing is about writing, which is a means of representing a language; writing is not a language. The difficulty of understanding a Chinese person would not suddenly become clearer with Romanization. Sure Chinese has a tough writing system, but most of the world's language aren't written at all; in order to compare apples to apples, writing (a relatively new technology in the history of language) is necessarily left out of the equation. 

Two reasons the author gives are not inherent difficulties with Chinese, but is rather a difficulty of the distance between English and Chinese (tones, cognates). It also doesn't help his case that he lies about the importance of tone. There are extensive tone sandhi effects in Chinese (meaning that tones can be modified due to their tonal contexts), which change the tone but not the meaning of the words. And if non-native speakers get the tone wrong, it's like getting stress placement wrong in English: sometimes it makes it impossible to recognize, but usually it just sounds funny.

The author also mentions Classical Chinese, which is like mentioning Old English. It has no bearing on today.

Don't expect to find an apartment in 1 day, you will need a couple of weeks, unless you have a contact here or already have something nailed down and just need to do the final paper work. Also, have a dossier of references, general finances, etc since many landlords will ask for that.

Eating: street food here is pretty cheap, around 5 euros for a kebab and fries. There are some places where you can get more vegetables than the traditional meat and carb diet here. ""Maoz"" by St. Michel is not bad, and Chez Gladines is also good. I would recommend a combination of eating out and cooking at home. At the very least you can keep pre-mixed salads and fruits in your fridge at home, this will help you balance your diet here.

RATP: Depends where your school is. If it is outside of Paris, then an ImagineR card might be worth it in the long run. It really depends on how much you plan to use the trains here. Calculate how many trips you will take on the trains per day and find the total for the month. Then compare that price with the ImagineR and Navigo passes. (For example, I live in the 14th arrondissment and my school is in 7th, I take the metro daily, about 6 times a day, including seeing friends or going out. I use the month Navigo pass because that is the cheapest option.)

Well, I'll give it a shot (I'll try to edit this post with locations on google maps later):

Imho, the thing you really don't wanna miss in Bordeaux is also the free part : visiting the city. I've been here for more than ten years and some place still amaze me !

You really want to take a walk through the ""Quai de Bordeaux"" along the Garonne (the river). Start near the playgrounds for a nice promenade, check the ""Pont de Pierre"" (romantic bridge, build by Napoleon Bonaparte. each of the pillar stands for one letter of his name). Continue toward the ""place de la bourse"", be sure to check the pretty ""porte Cailleau on your left"" and the wonderful ""mirroir d'eau"" (not sure if it will be working though). 

If you can, I suggest you come back at night, the lights are just wonderful.

Then turn left, cross the ""Place des Quinquonces"" (longest place in Europe, Pink Floyd made a concert there during the ""Pulse"" tour), then turn left again to see the ""Place du grand theatre"". go toward the ""rue sainte Catherine"", a walking avenue with lots of shops. Go all the way to the ""Place de la Victoire"" with its arch and beautiful University. You are in the very center of Bordeaux.

At this point, I suggest you go back, turning into the Cours Pasteur to reach the ""Place Pey Berland"" and check the tower (you can climb, but it's not free, and there is no elevator) and the cathedral (you can go in, no problem, just don't make noise).

Then turn right, toward the ""Quartier Saint Pierre"", Reach the ""Place Camille Julian"" (there is a cinema there, in a great ancient building) turn left, continue to ""place du Parlement Sainte Catherine"". You will find a lot of restaurants and bars in this area.

I'm not really into restaurant and I don't know your budget so I'm gonna give some broad advice.

Hyper classy : La Tupina. Never tried it, never even checked the prices, but its reputation goes beyond our frontiers : )

Good typical french food : ""le cochon volant"" or ""Le Bistrot des Capucins"". ""L'entrecote"" is also really known, but it's hard to find a place (and I fond it meh, but everyone I know loved it). Don't worry about the frogs and stuff, all of these will provide you with good juicy meat and french fries if you want.

Also, almost any of the restaurant near the ""place du Parlement Sainte Catherine""I mentioned earlier will do the job.

I also enjoy going to the pub. You'll find nice people, often talking in English. I recommend the ""Black velvet"" (good, cheap burgers), the ""Sweeney Todd"" (Burgers too, some nice waitress) and the ""Dick Turpins"" (really cosy, but small).

Nice people (like me) also meet at the Apollo.

If you like wine, I strongly suggest the ""Chabrot"", really nice decoration, wonderful mood and waitress, and good food.

If you are a night owl, you should be aware that everything is closed at 2 am. You might want to end the night in clubs, on either side of the ""Quai"". The ""Iboat"" seems to be quite popular at the moment.Never tried it, but heard about it a lot. Don't go too late or they won't let you in unless you're a rock star (are you ?) In general, clubs are so-so but if you like to dance, it's ok, there are quite a few girls in there : )  and I never got into trouble going out in such places.

While it's important that we tackle the backlog of cases, weakening the ECHR is not the way to do it. In fact, the ECHR is already pretty weak in the UK and Ireland; a finding by Strasbourg that a UK statute is incompatible with the ECHR has no real impact on the legal validity of the statute. I don't really understand why Brits get so worked up about the ECHR, as it doesn't really do anything to undermine their sovereignty. I think a lot of people mistakenly conflate the ECHR with the EU.

It would be interesting to see exactly what changes are proposed, and it's unfortunate that news articles like this never go into more detail.

The Falklands /Malvinas issue is another proof of this as they need extra revenue (oil).

This just shows us that the IMF current austerity recipe (mid economic crisis) is disastrous for anyone employing and exporting. It merely creates a privatization movement that in the short-run destroys the business sector, seeks for monopolies and high profits next to an already economically stressed population. It's suicidal.

With this I mean Argentina is internationally dead but so is the IMF just a little further down the road.

I suppose it would also be hard to find language that stated that EU law and national *constitutions* are on the same level, given that e.g. the UK doesn't even have a (written) national constitution. On the other hand, there's the case of the Constitution of Ireland which explicitly states the supremacy of EU law over national law - presumably including the constitution.

- a bit of Polish punk rock: Defekt Muzgó - [Ambiwalencje](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q-zXUXaG48)
The things that ka_mil posted are also interesting (especially [Brodka](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ycOABMpIyE)), and more mainstream.

Spelling is a representation of language; orthography would not change word order, tone, prosody, word-formation, or any of the other major facets of language.

In today's language, you can absolutely say you are fluent in French without being able to write it, especially if you grew up speaking it at home with no formal instruction in it. Fluency in a language has nothing to do with the capacity to write it. Languages are spoken; some cultures have developed means of representing their languages, but again, that's culture, not language.

I mentioned the plethora of irregulars that make the morphological alternations much more semantically conditioned (as opposed to automatic which is easier to learn/generalize). The syntax, cases/tenses, person/number, agreements, these are all much more complicated in English or are concepts completely nonexistent in Chinese. You see, I too have studied both languages among a couple others. You seem to be talking mostly about the writing system but that's got nothing to do with understanding the language as it is spoken, which is what I'm talking about. I will agree that the characters are hard to learn, true. That's not what's important. As someone with a degree in linguistics and Chinese (and many years of study thereof) I will tell you that Chinese has a significantly simpler grammar than Germanic/romance languages. I will also reiterate that most linguists would agree here and depending on where you are from, it will almost always be easier to learn than English. If this is still unclear I'm talking about learning to speak. Others have pointed out quite succinctly why writing is irrelevant in this discussion. 

That said, if you're having that much trouble with tones you're doing it wrong. As others have said you may be thinking about them too hard when speaking. If you ask Chinese people, they will confirm that moving to a different province or even different town (or in bigger cities, different sections of said city even) will reveal to you that tones are pronounced differently for different words in different places.

The ECHR is a political body that makes political decisions, no amount of naming it ""Human Rights"" will change that. You want the UK to have human rights defined from without, and there is nothing wrong with that, nor is there anything with wanting it to be defined from within exclusively, especially when decisions from without means that you can't get rid of pieces of shit like Abu Qatada.

EDIT: there is no sacred law to be enforced. If it is contraversial, it is not above politics. This is what the Canadian Liberals need to see about the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the US Republicans need to see of their constitution. The only reason the UK's Magna Carta seems above politics is that everyone now agrees with it, but back in the day It was controversial.

It is not ""arbitrary interference with his privacy"" because it is very specific, they want specific information for specific people.

&gt;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.

These rights aren't being violated. You can practice whatever religion you want, the airlines will get a hint if you request a specific meal (No pork, beef, or vegetarian may hint towards a religion but it does not disclose it. Also, I don't think any airlines log which passenger picked which meal)

There may be other laws that this violates but it does not violate the UDHR. It is not completely unreasonable for the US to want information on people flying to the US, that information should be limited to just the basics, information that is on your passport, if they want intra-EU flight data, or EU-not US flight data then they can fuck off. 

I don't like them getting credit card numbers, or seat number, or any information other than what is on my passport, which if you're flying to the US, they'll get anyway. Just another reason not to fly to the states.

Barcelona is the capital of Catalunya, so Spanish is pretty widespread there (as opposed to smaller towns around the region in which they only speak Catalan).

Argentina defaulted in 2001. If she keeps going like this, Argentina will default again. The only way she's carried on this far is by looting an extra 5% of her GDP or so every few years, but that can only go on for so long before she runs out of things to loot and, consequently, runs out of money.

When you are looking for the ""quality"" of a typical American steak then you are out of luck, because these ""qualities"" are actually signs of a corn-based diet. Corn-fed cattle grows faster (lower price), it gets much fatter (your ""marbling"", plus again: lower price) and it doesn't burn calories building up nasty muscles because it just does not have to move (your ""texture"" plus: lower price). You also won't get the copious amounts of antibiotics the vast majority of American cattle gets.

How many hospitals do you think you'd have to close then? 


But please, by all means, don't take my word for it. Just hand back the IMF money and be at the mercy of the free markets, I'd honestly be happy for Portugals sake if you prove me wrong. 

Also, who do you think provides the money to the IMF that they loans you? Among others, Swedish tax payers. We could have used the money differently, or, since you seem to be praising the free market, we would at least have gotten interest rate (at the free market rate) if we have lended you the money. On the other hand, we might not have done that since our government doesn't like careless spending when there's no telling if we will get the money back. Now we give the IMF money, and they lend it to you at a lower rate. In short, Swedish tax payers are subsidising Portugal's loans.

Why did you take those loans then? Why have you build up a state whose bills you can't pay for? We didn't force you, yet we are now subsidising your loans (and we voted no to the Euro btw)

Even if Greece got the drachma tomorrow and devalued the hell out of it to pay back, the banks will not accept it, and they can drag Greece to court for it (Luxenbourg courts are responsible for interpreting the new loans under UK laws) .There has to be major political interference, and maybe new laws, some of the investors will obviously go bonkers etc. 
3. The devaluation of south currencies, according to studies I've seen will be around 50% or even more. Also, due to the fact that these economies will try to keep most of the resource they produce internally in the beginning, so as to feed and clothe their people, in the short run even that 50% will be optimistic (I mean you will get that money, but there will be no products to buy with it, and as I said above they might even flood the market with worthless new printed currency)

The ""rest of us""? I would encourage you to be more careful in your claiming of support from all of the people who aren't me. It's so over-confident as to be obviously false.

Direct democracy is in action in one country, Switzerland. The last notable thing it was enacted for there was to ban minarets so muslims couldn't have any sort of obvious presence in their country. This sort of tyranny of the majority action is precisely why so many political thinkers oppose direct democracy.

&gt;But I am impressed. I thought neo-liberals were aware of only one political system. Brutal Corporate Dictatorship.

Firstly, I'm not neo-liberal. While there are aspects of classical and neo liberal ideology which I support (free trade and markets, globalisation, free enterprise), my economic politics reside slightly left of centre, and I think there are plenty of issues which should necessarily lie within the state's purview (healthcare, rail transport, police services, airports, postal services, electricity transport and delivery, and a host of other regulatory bodies).

Secondly, can you please stop being so obnoxiously rude and condescending to me please? You act as if because I differ in my beliefs from you that that necessitates my ignorance of political or economic systems - for surely if I knew what you knew I would agree with you. That sort of arrogance in one's beliefs is, quite frankly, very teenage.

&gt;Can you sell your liver ? According your syllogism you don't own your liver.

I can think of no deontologically moral reason that I should not be able to sell my liver - and I'm not sure I follow you in your saying that I do not own my liver, but do feel free to explain further.

&gt;From Enron to BP to Banks to all kinds of corruption cases. There have been numerous journal articles on the subject and a ton of comprehensive studies.

You seem to think this is an indictment of business - it is not, it is an indictment of human kind. Have a look at [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/World_Map_Index_of_perception_of_corruption_2010.svg/1000px-World_Map_Index_of_perception_of_corruption_2010.svg.png) map of public sector corruption perception. You'll note that nearly the entire world's public sector is perceived as being extremely corrupt by the people who it supposedly serves. Interesting also to note is that the vast majority of countries which are in blue or yellow on that map are very highly globalised free market or mixed economy countries.

Corruption is a problem stemming from humans being human, not from corporations existing. Its presence in corporations like Enron or BP or Banks is inevitable - these were/are huge organisation with tens or hundreds of thousands of employees. There are countries where one can not function on a day to day basis without paying bribes, and organisations like BP can go years without a single case of corruption - if anything that speaks to me quite remarkably of the culture behind corruption, as opposed to the corporate/public sector divide so normally picked upon.


&gt;BTW, I was always wondered about people like you.

People like me? I am curious, what do you mean by that? People who hold different beliefs than you?

&gt;Have you actually worked in a corporate environment (at a high enough position to see deals taking place) or done any sort of business ?

Nope. I'm currently a student once again. I'm curious what a different answer to this question would have meant to you.

&gt;I can understand you holding your views if you are rich.

Which views are you specifically talking about here? I have a feeling you are making far too many assumptions about me.

&gt;But it recently occurred to me that there are people that favour free market policies even though they themselves don't benefit directly (and had little experience with any market)

I didn't say the south should each get their own currencies back, I said the south should keep the *existing* euro and the north should create a *new* euro.

Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal and perhaps even France should be included would all have the same currency, the old euro, Germany and the Northern states would all have a new currency.

This means, none of the southern nations can be targeted individually, they are in a currency bloc and they have a central bank which can buy their debt (QE), this will keep their interest rates low as it has in the UK. This will give them time to try and fix their economies, at the same time the old ""southern"" euro will devalue vs the new ""northern"" euro and against world currencies, they will get competitive again vs the rest of the world the way they always have, partly by devaluation.

The northern banks will be paid back in the old ""southern"" euro, just as all the contracts say, the north will pay the south with the new ""northern"" euro which will be worth more than the southern euro so the south aren't going to complain because they're being paid more than they expected.

You've responded by generally saying you disagree. If that's all you can do then there's not much point to this. I need you to go one step further and give a reason why you disagree, or show me what has lead you to believe in a position which is different to my own.

Yes, as organisations themselves. Every organisation is corrupt to one degree or another, and public organisations are no different than private ones - both types experience corruption.

&gt;Yes - but there are some organisations that attract corruption like a magnet.

You might claim this, but you provide absolutely no supporting evidence. I would suggest that this belief is part of your ideology but I wonder whether you've ever actually found any evidence to support it even for yourself, or whether you just trust it because it fits your worldview.

&gt;Hmm. I was expecting something like that. It wouldn't make any difference - I am just trying to understand why anyone would support private shareholders unless he is one.

You seem trapped in this dichotomy of ""private shareholders"" against everyone else. I'm a world citizen, I have interest in all of the world's economy doing well. I also try to live a moral life, and would like others to do the same. What Kirchner has done in this particular case is to steal the property of another organisation for her country. I disagree with theft or expropriation.

&gt;Supporting private shareholders (in the Kirchner case) and not accepting democratic control of corporations.

Do you really see this situation that simply? That either one accepts democratic control (whatever that's supposed to mean) or one supports private shareholders? I wonder, is the issue you have simply that anyone would own anything? It is starting to seem that way.

In the Kirchner case I don't so much support Repsol as oppose what she has done. She's used the fact that she has an entire state at her disposal and a monopoly on force within that state to take what does not belong to her or her country. You can say it **should** but it did not, her husband's predecessor legally sold it.

By ""democratic control"" do you mean state ownership of all corporations or what? I'm not having a go, but I'm just trying to figure out whether you're approaching the issue from a communist or anarchist or just hard left socialist perspective, or perhaps simply from the perspective of someone who simply hates capitalism. Just curious.

&gt;So why not energy ?

It depends. In the case of a country like my own I would favour private generation, due to the diverse range of power generation sources that exist in my country. This enables competition between various power generation companies and yet due to the diversity of generation types allows my government to pick the best deal. Once the power leaves the powerplant I'm in favour of state control from there on.

Overall, I have no problem with state-run energy companies, but that is not what this entire issue is about, and I'm surprised you're not catching onto this.

People aren't angry because Kirchner wants to run Argentina's oil fields with the state, people are angry because in order to achieve this she stole what was not hers. It is not about what she wants to do, it is entirely about how she has gone about achieving it. If Argentina had paid the market value of YFP then you wouldn't hear a peep from me - it's theft I oppose, not state run agencies.",0,1334938457,null,0,true,0,c4el4gv,t3_si6qt,t1_c4el4gv,t1_c4ekxo5,null,1428761615,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I've explained that previously. Direct ownership with no rights to sell. The same way you can't sell your nationality, your liver or many other things. They are ""you"".

Means of production. None should  own means of production. I understand you can come back with various questions, but I think the argument has been put forward much better in the socialist litterature. 

As for democracy, it requires people to be involved in it, actively, in an everyday basis, with decisions taken without mediators.

This I don't believe in. Partly because I've never experienced any competition while working in the private sector. I can qualify this further if you want, but with the exception of some industries (mainly high tech ones - and for a limited subset of all employees) it makes much more sense for corporations to compete against their workers and the rest of society then against each other.

You're generalising the actions of a few to the desires of the whole. Yes, of course scandals happen all over Europe. Scandals happen all over the world. The point is that bad behaviour is not unique to rich people, or to executives, or to shareholders, or to corporations. It is an aspect of humanity. We can oppose the bad behaviour without opposing the benefits brought by capitalism.

It's not really control if you can't sell it.

&gt;The same way you can't sell your nationality, your liver or many other things. They are ""you"".

I can't sell my nationality because the state reserves the power to grant that or not. You may say my liver can not be sold because that is ""me"" but I'm betting you support people's rights to euthanasia or to voluntarily consume drugs. You also presumably are OK with people selling their time to work.

&gt;Means of production. None should own means of production.

So if one group of people work hard to build an oil rig, others should automatically own that too, even if they have not helped at all?

&gt;As for democracy, it requires people to be involved in it, actively, in an everyday basis, with decisions taken without mediators.

That's impossible though. Your average person on the street does not have the time, education, or ability to be heavily involved in politics on a full time basis. It's an intensive thing, and requires expertise and long term knowledge. Little 20 year old Johnny down the road who works at the butcher and has a nice dorris at home is not going to have the time, proberly nor the education, to consider the long term impacts of quantitiate easing with regards to growth prospects vis-á-vis emerging economies, or to consider the finer points of international extradition treaties.

This is the entire reason we have representative democracy, because it prevents the tyranny of the majority, and because not everyone can be an expert on politics.

&gt;This I don't believe in. Partly because I've never experienced any competition while working in the private sector.

Presumably you haven't worked very high up in it. I've experienced competition and I've never been a high level worker.

&gt;it makes much more sense for corporations to compete against their workers

A corporation can't compete against it's workers, since they have mutual goals, not to mention that the workers are the corporation. To compete against oneself is almost oxymoronic.

Light boxes emit high intensities of light of 2,500 to 10,000 lux (as compared to a normal light fixture that emits 250 to 500 lux) and produce similar effects to the sun's natural rays. The high intensities of light improve the mood of those suffering from the winter blues because they restrict the secretion of melatonin in the brain. These boxes are best used daily and in the early morning for periods of 30 minutes to two hours.

So basically we ended up in a situation that when you add the numbers up on paper, it looks like it's gonna take quite a while for everything to return to normal, unless you account for factors that nobody is publically thinking about yet, such as the US getting their own little debt crisis soon (elections coming up, and they are also gonna have to increase their debt ceiling again around the same time, record high deficits, maybe a little scandal about unemployment being worse than they claimed.. use your imagination a bit :P)... suddenly Europe is gonna be considered a much safer place to invest your money as they are already addressing the problems that the US is likely to run into (it's not about if, it's about when). It would seem all that needs to happen for this to begin is for their interest rates to start rising.

I understand that this may be too 'conspiracy theory' for some people, but you need to remember that Spain, for example, doesn't have a debt problem, it has a growth/unemployment problem. I regularly watch the various economic announcements from various countries as they come in and the US very often releases higher than forecasted numbers and then revises them the next month to much lower, whereas Germany for example, releases lower numbers and revises them higher later.. it would seem to me that a big ""oops"" such as ""hmm.. the US economy hasn't grown in the last year at all, in fact it shrank"" could very well set things in motion. Is it possible that we are just buying time for such a thing to happen?

**Quick Ninja Update:**

I understand that a lot of time when I make a statement, I fail to convince people as I have a hard time explaining how I got to that conclusion. I like to look at a lot of information and my gut feeling tells me that what I described above is not so far-fetched.

Recent examples on April 15th:

It interests me that a lot of articles to do with the status of the US economy usually have things like ""probably grew"" and stuff like that.

This widely depends on which medias you are talking about. Obviously, left wing medias root for Hollande, while right wing medias root for Sarkozy. There is a general agreement that the electoral campaign has not sufficiently focused on the french economic crisis, with neither of the front-runners offering any type of compelling solution.

&gt; What are the French views on Hollande's financial plans and the implications of his higher taxes / lower military with regards to the European (esp. Germany) and the global economies?

Again, you will get different answers depending on who you ask. Personally, I think that his financial plans are absurd, and that he will not be able to implement them because of the EU's financial control over its member states. Hollande doesn't advocate any reduction of the military, and is fairly conservative in that regard.

The issues I am mostly interested in (cannabis legalization, constitutional reform for equal numbers of men and women at the french national assembly, reduction of the public debt) have not been debated seriously during the campaign, so my interest for this election is low.

It sells anger and fear to Middle England (middle class, neither poor nor rich, white). It is probably the most right-wing of the mainstream British newspapers, and disapproves of gays, blacks, speed cameras, Muslims, the unemployed, the poor, the disabled, the NHS, foreigners, anyone on state assistance, gypsies, teenagers, the EU and the Euro. It is a fan of the monarchy, the middle classes, and hanging.

Its morality is hypocritical, simultaneously tutting over prurient behaviour while entertaining its readers with prurient descriptions and photographs of the same.

Its science coverage, to paraphrase I think Ben Goldacre, consists almost exclusively of an ongoing ontological project to divide the world into things that cause cancer, and things that cure it.

Although and broadly ideologically aligned with the Conservative Party, it does criticise them as well.

Yes there was, it was the potato blight. 

&gt; The British were shipping all the other agriculture back to the UK, the wheat, the barley, the fish, the meat. That all belonged to Britain.

No, the landowners in Ireland were *selling* their goods to their largest market, and didn't care about starving tenant farmers. They certainly didn't want to *give* the food away.

&gt; The same thing happened in Bengal, it is estimated over 1.8 billion were starved to death in India by the crown and their subjects during its tenure there. Literally starved to death.

That sounds very unlikely to me. 1.8 billion? The population of India in 1900 was 283 million people. That doesn't seem to square with your rather interesting estimate. 

&gt; This starving people to death was perfected and tuned in the second boer war

The largest cause of death during the Boer war was cholera, not starvation. The camps were poorly designed and cholera killed off a lot of people. It also spread to British troops, and was the largest cause of death for soldiers during the war.

And Sarkozy, unlike him, managed to duck fire for quite a few weeks. Both candidate didn't really argue economics (they would have made unrealist promises anyway). And there's a little worry for Sarkozy that some of his entourage, or himself, will be indicted for corruption related issues (mainly Karachi, and some financing campaign problem that goes back to 95 and his mentor Balladur).

&gt; [1] This article was in this morning's New York Times, so if there's any comment about what's written in the article, please say!

This article is terrible, there's so many things wrong with it that I won't bother writing an articulate response and just make a quick list.

&gt; Mr. Sarkozy faces an electoral dilemma that is inherently tactical. Presuming he gets through to the runoff on May 6, does he continue to run to the right, or move to the center? And will it make enough of a difference anyway in a nation that admires what he promised at the beginning of his term five years ago — a “rupture” with the past — but not what he has delivered, which is a stagnant economy and unemployment at its highest level in 12 years? 

Sarkozy is, with Mitterand, the most divisive candidat of French politics since World War 2. His strategy in matters has often be to divide, there is no way that you could say the *nation* admired him because of his style. He won with 53% of the elected suffrage, but the 47% who voted against him hated him with a passion. Still do today. What you could say is that his supporters were very fervent, convinced that he was different from the other politics (and the same could be said about the base of his 2007 Rival, Ségolène Royal). Ironically, both of them were in politics since twenty to thirty years.

As for Sarkozy shift to the center, it is impossible, because him and some of his ministres have made some extreme comments, Guéant, his ministre de l'intérieur (Secretary of state would be the US equivalent) had quite a few racist or nearly-racist declaration because his goal was to flame the left and rally the far-right. Today, Sarkozy is trapped and his only hope is that Mélenchon and Bayrou eats Hollande advantage, but polls suggest it won't happen.

&gt; Catherine Nay, Mr. Sarkozy’s biographer, calls the president a terrible communicator. “He never capitalizes on his successes, he changes the subject every day, people forget the next day what he did the day before, he fogs the brain,” she said. “He’s the victim of too fiery a temperament.” 

What is this ? I don't even know if I'm on the prestigious NYT anymore. Sarkozy is one of the best communicator of french politics, he purposedly make his speech dumber (and his gramar incorrect) to seduce a popular base. He also has put forward all his success with an almost theatrical manner : he pretended he saved the Bulgar nurses from Kadhafi, saved Georgia (country is in a shithole now) or more recently, broadcasted an excerpt from his video-conference with Obama (because Obama is ""cool"" in France, and he tried to suck his coolness...didn't work though).

&gt; Mr. Sarkozy is running hard to place first on Sunday to give him momentum going into the second round. And even if he trails Mr. Hollande on Sunday, he will remember that Jacques Chirac trailed his Socialist rival in the first round in 1995 and won anyway. 

Factually blind, Chirac trailed his socialist rival but his main rival was from the same political party (Balladur) ! Thus if Chirac won the first round, second round was basically safe.

&gt; Growing inequality has become a hot-button topic across Europe, and if Mr. Hollande were to win, the move to impose higher taxes on the wealthy could get a boost elsewhere, even in the United States, where President Obama has already promoted the so-called Buffett Rule to impose a minimum tax rate on incomes in excess of $1 million a year.

The highly decentralized U.S. of A. under the articles of confederation was a mess. It lasted from 1777 to 1787 until our current constitution was adapted. The parties of that time were the federalists, and the anti-federalists. The federalist papers made a number of very strong points advocating for a stronger central government, many of which are relevant to Europe's current situation. The balance we see today between the rights of the state and the rights of the federal government weren't really finalized until after the civil war during reconstruction. Nonetheless, the fact that there is a single head of the executive branch, and commander in chief, was a much needed improvement.

Europe is currently under the articles of confederation, maybe a little better. Still, like America at the time, Europe is paralyzed from getting a lot of things done as a whole. For europeans out there who claim that Europe is too diverse, all I have to say is that there have been countless successful multi-ethnic societies in history. What caused the civil war in america was the vastly different society and economies of the north and south. The north was industrial, plutocratic, and very urban. The south was agricultural and feudal-esque. There was an upper echelon of land owning aristocracy, few people with land enough for themselves, a lot of slaves, and even more people who were ready to do anything to stay above slaves on the social ladder.

Ses propositions économiques en particulier montrent bien qu'elle ne maîtrise pas (ou ne peut pas admettre) le fonctionnement d'une économie : dans son son dernier passage dans l'émission ""des paroles et des actes"", elle a lourdement insisté sur le fait qu'un état qui emprunte à une banque centrale c'est pareil qu'un état qui fait librement fonctionner une planche à billet. en donnant l'exemple des USA. Ses propositions économiques ne pourraient pas résulter en autre chose qu'une inflation massive et une augmentation de la dette.

Ses arguments sur l'immigration et la laïcité sont tout aussi douteux, en plus d'être extrêmement divisifs. Et elle n'est que la figure de proue d'une organisation qui est bien plus virulente à ce sujet.

Elle gronde après les débordements des musulmans mais jamais ceux des catholiques, s'oppose au financement des écoles confessionnelles musulmanes mais pas des écoles catholiques, n'a rien contre le concordat d'Alsace/Moselle... bref, une ""laïcité"" très douteuse. Elle oublie également un peu vite que les nationalistes commettent plus de violences en Europe que les fondamentalistes musulmans.

En ce qui concerne l'immigration, elle (et Sarkozy avec) nie encore une fois complètement l'évidence. D'abord, l'immigration légale n'est que très difficilement limitable en France. Pour la majorité, il s'agit de mariages. Ensuite, il y a les étudiants étrangers (plutôt une bonne chose, non ?) et quelques travailleurs qualifiés (encore une bonne chose). Et il ne faut pas oublier que pour un pays vieillissant comme la France ou la natalité n'est pas très élevée, l'immigration peut être intéressante. Il a d'ailleurs été montré, à la demande du gouvernement actuel il me semble, que l'immigration, loin de coûter à la France, rapporte au contraire 20 milliards par an... mais ce n'est pas elle ou Sarkozy qui le criera sur les toits ! 

L'immigration illégale quant à elle, est un problème bien plus difficile qu'elle ne le reconnaîtra jamais. On ne peut pas protéger des milliers de kilomètres de frontières. Renvoyer des gens chez eux coûte cher, est logistiquement très complexe. Et tout ça se fait a un coût humain catastrophique. L'immigration illégale est par ailleurs encouragée par certaines grosses entreprises qui préfèrent faire travailler des sans papiers, en faisant mine de ne pas savoir, que de devoir respecter le droit du travail français qu'il jugent trop contraignant.
