true,aniraa,null,null,"&gt;They generally need to be grounded in some sort of reason besides ""'cos I say so"".

I don't claim the reason is ""cos' I said so"". I claim the reason human rights are human rights is because they are agreed upon, codified and signed as such. This way I do not have to rely on some conception of ""natural rights"".

&gt;You're yet to demonstrate any moral grounding in your claim that water is a human right though.

First of all, I do not claim that water is a human right. I might argue that it *should* be a human right, though.

Second, quoting Wikipedia, ""These rights may exist as natural rights or as legal rights, in both national and international law."" Following the second definition, I claim that it is a human right the moment it is declared a human right by the General Assembly.

&gt;That depends, are there laws which mandate some? Yes certainly. Are they moral? Much bigger question. I tend to deal in morality, not in questions of law, since the law is never perfect and obviously brutally wrong.

This is the crux of our argument I think and I do see the problem you address. The only moral argument I would be comfortable providing is one based on the lowest common denominators already recognized/agreed upon in the human rights treaties -- an extension of the right to life, perhaps, or the inherent dignity of all members of the human family, or something like that. In the end, however, I think it does come down to ""let's agree that humans should have this as a right.""

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  A shipping company wants to offload in Greece and turn its ship back around back for Asia and let another company pick it up? That's an EU port, my friend, so now we have to look at this percentage figure with even more incredulity.

It doesn't really make any sense for British exports to travel to Asia via Greece. The UK may not have a port as large as Rotterdam, but it does have four pretty large ones that each on its own move at least twice as much cargo as the largest port in Greece, and two of them move more containers.

&gt;  It's no coincidence that the Med has several large hub ports, or why we're unloading in Holland in the first place.

No, it's [no coincidence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine%E2%80%93Meuse%E2%80%93Scheldt_delta). In terms of waterways, it's the gateway to much of the Continent. I've already given you *all* trade with the Netherlands and Belgium, I refuse to believe British exporters ship their goods to the Mediterranean by rail for them to go back through Gibraltar on their way to Asia or the Americas, instead of the UK's four major ports with direct access to the Atlantic.

&gt; Not only do I believe most of the regulations make sense, I'm also well aware that how Britain votes in European elections is also not indicative of how the rest of Europe tends to vote. This in turn means what say Britain has in such matters is by and large irrelevant. 

Most decisions still have to be made unanimously. But yeah, the UK frequently is the odd one out. There are people in Brussels (and Paris, especially) who may conclude that losing the UK as a member wouldn't be all that bad. Which leads me to:

&gt; That is not to say either that the UK leaving the EU would have to adopt either a Norwegian or a Swiss template, and couldn't negotiate a UK version. Out of the 3 I'd argue the UK more so.

The impression I'm getting is that ""the UK regular Joes and Josephines"" indeed have been lead to believe that this would be on the table. So let me restate my ""possibly the worst argument the pro-EU crowd could make"". Be it 43% of exports, 40% or even less, UK&lt;-&gt;EU trade is *much* more important for the UK than for the EU. The UK is important for the EU, but it could do without you. If, on the other hand, more of the rich countries would leave, because the UK got to keep all the benefits of the Common Market after leaving the other rich countries with footing the bill for the internal transfers, that would be a problem. Therefore, the EU cannot afford to set such a precedent, and conveniently it doesn't have to. You want access to (then) our market, you play by our rules. If this may seem arrogant, have another look at your statement above, in which you appear to express a believe that somehow the EU would let the UK treat the EU treaties like a buffet and just sign off on it, and that right after you would have given us the political equivalent of a ""fuck you"", which many of the leading figures would take very personally. *That's* arrogant.",0,1350583140,null,0,false,0,c6oe7s0,t3_11okcd,t1_c6oe7s0,t1_c6obmv6,null,1430181350,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Kohl wanted to show that the East Germans are equal to the West. 
And it is true that was the cause of a lot of economic problems. 
The companies in East Germany were not very competitive at the beginning. The economic reform caused that the wages were also converted on a 1:1 basis (and not only the savings via the currency reform) which made it even worse. 
Many companies had to close and unemployment was high. 

Kohl promised that we will have a ""flourish landscape"" in the East soon.
But soon after the Reunification East Germans only got a high unemployment rate, and of course the didn't want to wait for it and many of them left the east to find work in West Germany. Leaving the old behind. 

A Problem we still have and something which makes comparing the former GDR with other satellite states rather difficulty.

Wait.  You don't think British exports come on a British exports ship, and  German exports all go on a German ship, American on American ship, etc.?  It's far more economical to have cargo going constantly between the Holland and Greece, and for a ship to turn around back to Asia, a ship in Greece turn around from Holland, and dispersion happening as it goes and taking cargo back, with other shipping picking up and delivering more locally. 


The point is the effect happens.  Is happening.  That's what they do.  


The way it happens is that a whole bunch of stuff going from one part of the world going to another part of the world gets shipped onto something headed that direction, it enters hubs, and is broken up as it goes along.  That's why we use Holland and other ports, why Greek shipping is a big thing.

&gt; I refuse to believe British exporters ship their goods to the Mediterranean by rail for them to go back through Gibraltar on their way to Asia or the Americas

Christ Almighty.  Another ship comes in and takes it the rest of the journey.  A ship from Asia isn't going to stop off at every European port like the postman delivering only that country's aid.  They'll drop it off at a point and other ships will move in, that well keeping their manifests full.  Can you imagine the losses a shipping company would make if it's visiting the last country on its delivery route with a virtually empty ship?

&gt;Most decisions still have to be made unanimously. 

Hogwash.  We're talking about regulations and that's why the EU is made up of voting blocs.  Unanimous nothing.

&gt;o let me restate my ""possibly the worst argument the pro-EU crowd could make"". Be it 43% of exports, 40% or even less, UK&lt;-&gt;EU trade is much more important for the UK than for the EU.

So your argument is that the EU would implement a trade-pyhrric attack.  So, so wrong, and even if they were to try selling that as a reason to stay in the EU to people from the UK.  

&gt;The UK is important for the EU, but it could do without you.

Of course it could.  It could even do better.  Cutting off UK trade however would be like cutting off a leg in a battlefield with a rusty shit ladle because of an ingrowing toenail, however.   
  
&gt; If, on the other hand, more of the rich countries would leave, because the UK got to keep all the benefits of the Common Market after leaving the other rich countries with footing the bill for the internal transfers, that would be a problem.

Nope.  All the other big major players get something extra other than the 4 freedoms, and Norway outside the EU still foots its share of the bill for being part of the common market but outside the EU.  So you're wrong on two accounts.

&gt;the political equivalent of a ""fuck you"", which many of the leading figures would take very personally. That's arrogant.

Where's the 'fuck you' and where's the 'arrogance'?

It lets the EU have its federalism, it lets the EU do its financial reform however misguided others think of it.  We still trade with each other.  The UK still contributes in a scaled version to what Norway does, if they go down that route, plus the UK which is better placed to make trade agreements with the Commonwealth is more than likely going to benefit the remaining EU as well.

Why is it arrogant for a major contributor to want something more in line to what Norway or Switzerland has, when the UK veto is somewhat of a sticking point anyway?

true,jdrama83,null,null,"1) Yup, but it doesn't really matter what you do when you're a minority, the true test of what most people believe occurs when they can actually achieve it. Turkey was supposed to be the most progressive country with an Islamic majority. I don't think anyone would be surprised if this happened in Saudi Arabia, or Bahrain, or the UAE, or Pakistan, but it happened in Turkey.

2) Does that matter? Incidents like these shouldn't be prosecuted to begin with, could you imagine something like this coming before a court in any civilised western country?

3) Like I said, no one would be surprised if this happened in Saudi Arabia. Likewise, no one is under the illusion that Russia is some bastion of liberal democracy. Furthermore, you really couldn't have found a more insincere example. Pussy Riot wasn't prosecuted because Russians (or their government) really care about that sort of thing, it's pretty widely known that they were prosecuted for their criticism of Putin. Might this be the case in Turkey? Possibly, but so far there's no evidence to suggest it.

4) I probably should've been a little more clear. Islam is an inherently fascist ideology. It was founded that way by Muhammad as a warlord and conquerer, and it continues to be practised that way by his followers. This kind of behavior isn't ""extremist"", it's par for the course. Saying ""well, there are violent and authoritative Christians out there too"" is true, but those people can rightfully be called zealots because Christ was a pacifist in every meaning of the word.

&gt; La logique est la suivante : les éditeurs s’engagent à renoncer à leur droit d’empêcher l’indexation de leurs contenus par les moteurs de recherche. « En échange, reprend Nathalie Collin, on demande une compensation sous la forme d’un droit voisin, qui rémunérera la valeur créée par le fait d’indexer ces contenus. »

&gt; **Google doit-il de l’argent aux journaux ?**

&gt; Les sites d’info peinent à trouver un modèle économique et lorgnent les profits de Google : entre 1,25 et 1,4 milliard d’euros de chiffre d’affaires en 2011 en France, selon BFM Business, mais il n’en déclare qu’une toute petite partie dans l’Hexagone et paye très peu d’impôts. Les éditeurs, eux, n’arrivent pas à monétiser leur audience


Après avoir lu... WTF! Résumé: les journaux pensent que Google doit leur payer une taxe parce qu'ils ""contribuent"" leurs gros titres aux résultats du recherche, sans lesquels tel service n'existerait pas, et qu'ils doivent être du coup rémunérés. Ils rendent service à Google en n'utilisant pas robots.txt pour que leurs sites fourmillent de visiteurs qui passent par les liens de Google. Ils délirent trop au Libé, comme si le gros chiffre d'affaires de Google était lié d'une certaine façon au ""grand valeur"" contribué par les journaux français/belges/allemands. (Et j'aime bien le petit côté nationaliste pour ramasser du soutien: ils ne paient pas d'impôts, ils sont même pas français tu sais, c'est une boîte de ricains...)

Mais ça va pas la tête ? A les entendre tu dirais que Google piquent la totalité de leur contenu, sans référence à la source, et qu'il accapare tous les revenus publicitaires.  Comprennent-ils rien à l'Internet ? D'où vient la grande majorité de leurs visiteurs, je me demande ? De Google et d'autres, sans lesquels le nombre de visiteurs et leurs propres revenus pubs dégringoleraient comme des capucins de cartes. Récompensent-ils les sujets de leurs articles à chaque fois qu'ils référencent le nom de quelqu'un ? Comment est-ce possible d'argumenter en faveur de la forte baisse de ses revenus, la seule aboutissement d'un taxe et le déréférencement qui suit ?

Veulent-ils nous taxer des centimes à chaque fois qu'on passe devant une agence de presse où l'on peut voir les gros titres du journal du jour affiché ?

To the contrary, I even know that just because Greece has a giant merchant fleet it doesn't mean those ships go via Greek ports, particularly if they have departed in the UK. I can even back this statement up with [data](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=mar_go_am_uk&amp;lang=en). Out of the 454,743 thousand tonnes that went through British ports in 2010, only 967 thousand tonnes went to or came from a port in Greece. That's 0.2%.

&gt;  Unanimous nothing.

Oh, how I wish this was true.

&gt; So your argument is that the EU would implement a trade-pyhrric attack.

No, I'm saying that a common market makes trade much, much easier than, say, a mere free trade agreement. Without being a member of the common market, businesses in the UK would be in a disadvantage compared to those within, and accordingly lose contracts. The same is of course true the other way round, and the result is that trade will suffer.  
Now, you *can* be a part of the Common Market without being a member of the EU, just like Norway. But due to the nature of a common market, it's not possible to be a part of one without adhering to common regulations, on a technical basis. That's why you will need to accept regulations from Brussels *if* you want to be a part of the Common Market. Just like Norway. Since being subject to regulations from Brussels seems to be what Joe and Josephine British don't like about the EU, because they don't understand the difference between free trade and a common market, remaining within the Common Market seems to be besides the whole point of leaving the EU in the first place.

Instead, you seem to advocate a model where the UK would retain some aspects of membership that you deem favorable for the UK, with all the bureaucratic and political overhead the necessary new negotiations with the UK would cause each time Brussels decides on a new regulation that affects those areas. What on earth makes you think the EU would want to set a precedent for other countries to try the same thing? Keep in mind that (because unanimous decisions unfortunately do play a significant role within the EU) there would be, by then, 27 countries that could veto such an agreement. France is one of them.

&gt;  Cutting off UK trade however would be like cutting off a leg in a battlefield with a rusty shit ladle because of an ingrowing toenail, however.

There would still be trade with the UK, just less of it. Unless of course the UK still subjects itself to EU regulations that concern the Common Market, which is almost all of them.

&gt;  All the other big major players get something extra other than the 4 freedoms

I'm intrigued and would like to learn more.

&gt; Where's the 'fuck you' and where's the 'arrogance'?

Leaving the EU would be politically damaging to the union. The arrogance comes in when you think you can somehow get preferencial treatment in terms of a trade relationship where you choose which aspects of the Common Market you'd like to keep.

&gt; It lets the EU have its federalism, it lets the EU do its financial reform however misguided others think of it.

Yeah, as I said, some may conclude that it would be worth it. I'm not arguing that the UK leaving would necessarily be bad for the EU. I'm saying it would be bad for the UK. It's your decision, it's just that what I'm hearing from that crowd doesn't strike me as particularly well informed.

&gt; Why is it arrogant for a major contributor to want something more in line to what Norway or Switzerland has, when the UK veto is somewhat of a sticking point anyway?

As I said, something like with Norway would certainly be possible. I just don't understand what the whole point of leaving the EU would be if Brussels could still regulate the curvature of British grown bananas. If all you want is to save on CAP contributions and the like, again, why on earth should Brussels set a precedent with such a deal when the EU absolutely doesn't have to (see also: arrogance).

true,CDK2012,null,null,"&gt;To the contrary, I even know that just because Greece has a giant merchant fleet it doesn't mean those ships go via Greek ports, particularly if they have departed in the UK. I can even back this statement up with data. Out of the 454,743 thousand tonnes that went through British ports in 2010, only 967 thousand tonnes went to or came from a port in Greece. That's 0.2%.

That's their own Netherlands Distortion and part of the reason why Greece is so &amp;%*%$£ !!!

Greek shipping may register itself in different ports but it's still one of the largest shipping fleets in the world.  If something comes in via Greece but then goes onto another European port it still adds up to being counted as EU trade for the UK wherever the Greek fleets may drop it off on the way.   Greece gets a Netherlands Distortion when Greek shipping uses other EU ports to dodge taxes, those ports ship on and we see the Rosterdam Effect!  

The alarm bells should be ringing when a gateway to Europe and first port of call in the Med from the East only added up to .2%.  Clearly it's coming in that way and yet it's not going on a direct route to the UK.

Stop arguing for a second and think what it is you are trying to argue because it doesn't add up, for us or the Greeks.

&gt;No, I'm saying that a common market makes trade much, much easier than, say, a mere free trade agreement.

Great, we can be part of that and still outside the EU!  Norway.

&gt;Instead, you seem to advocate a model where the UK would retain some aspects of membership that you deem favorable for the UK, with all the bureaucratic and political overhead the necessary new negotiations with the UK would cause each time Brussels decides on a new regulation that affects those areas

And Lo' they should call it the EEA and it was blessed.  Amen

&gt;There would still be trade with the UK, just less of it. Unless of course the UK still subjects itself to EU regulations that concern the Common Market, which is almost all of them.

Which I addressed with the balancing sovereignty scales analogy earlier.   Don't make an argument against the UK having less sovereignty by accepting EU regulations when it has little say anyway indicative of the voting electorate, and when it means the UK also gets back CAP, CFP, trade negotiation rights and a seat at the WTO.  

That's all assuming a Norwegian model, there's nothing to say that the UK being what would still be a net contributor couldn't negotiate a UK model in addition to the Swiss and the Norwegian models.  It's not heresy.  It even makes common sense.  Why not?  The UK gets a say in matters that only affect it but in return Europe gets its own federalism and financial reform it so much craves without UK intervention!  Best of both worlds, for all.

As for it meaning less trade.  Piffle-waffle.

&gt;&gt;All the other big major players get something extra other than the 4 freedoms

&gt;I'm intrigued and would like to learn more.

Well, let's see.  The CAP and CFP isn't geared towards UK industries so those countries that do get a kick out of it get more.  Germany has certainly prospered by bringing Europe together from getting countries on the Euro...so that's the big countries and most of southern Europe accounted for.  The ascension countries speak for themselves as net beneficiaries...

The UK is one of the largest contributors and set to be the smallest recipient per capita than all of them, so obviously others are getting more out than what the UK is.

&gt;Leaving the EU would be politically damaging to the union. 

Would it?  Or would it be handshakes all around and other countries thinking that they didn't have a problem with the UK but its scepticism and veto was starting to slow things down a bit.

&gt;Yeah, as I said, some may conclude that it would be worth it. I'm not arguing that the UK leaving would necessarily be bad for the EU.

That's funny because you just said,

           ""Leaving the EU would be politically damaging to the union.""

Your argument isn't consistent; I'm not shifting goalposts.  Will it be damaging or not?

 &gt;I'm saying it would be bad for the UK. It's your decision, it's just that what I'm hearing from that crowd doesn't strike me as particularly well informed.

Well irony strikes abound because the issue I have is that the anti-EU argument is hardly ever addressed rather it's reframed into one that means it's either Empire building on the independent's part or one where they want to cut EU trade adrift, neither being the case.

&gt;I just don't understand what the whole point of leaving the EU would be if Brussels could still regulate the curvature of British grown bananas.

a)  they don't, that's a fallacy.  There is no banana status quo.

b)  the point is getting a seat on the WTO back, being able to negotiate with the commonwealth and those beyond first hand which the UK is more than equipped to do (if not better so), especially considering that EU trade negotiations can never be fully representative of the UK as the UK economy is not indicative of the EU.  Getting back the fishing industry, remodeling the agriculture policy to suit UK farms and not EU farms which are not similar, and doing our own financial sector reform which the EU blocked even though it would make banks more accountable and less likely to need bailouts without costing London it's premier status. 

&gt;If all you want is to save on CAP contributions and the like, again, why on earth should Brussels set a precedent with such a deal when the EU absolutely doesn't have to (see also: arrogance).

It does have to because it doesn't help the UK and the EU wants to go down the Federal route which the UK is steadfast against and can veto.",0,1350601312,null,0,1350614048,0,c6ojg1r,t3_11okcd,t1_c6ojg1r,t1_c6oiwer,null,1430183814,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

1. The countries seem to have in common that there is a lot of corruption and fraud. Incompetent governments (more than normal)
incapable of spending their money right. They are also on the South part of Europe. You might want to include Ireland in your list of problem countries but Ireland isn't that bad, they made some bad decisions but they can at least be trusted with their money. Most Southern States also have the culture that fraud is OK, and that if you aren't cheating the government then you're an idiot. 

2. Different from what? They are different from the more nordic/healthy  countries, there are also differences between the problemcountries themselves. 


3. The crisis doesn't say anything about the current state of the EU, As I believe the big problem isn't within the EU but in the Monetary Union. So all the countries that have adopted the Euro. 
What you might be able to say is that European Union would like more powers to be able to prevent these kind of things, however the individual countries don't wan't to give up their sovereignty. 
And personally I agree with not giving up anything because our country isn't as corrupt as the southern states, and if we would give up our sovereignity to the EU these corrupt idiots that can't do anything right would also have a say in our budgets. It's just really that we can't trust them (with our money), If they would want more integration and it was only with awesome countries like Germany, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, etc. There wouldn't be that much resistance.

And if you look at the current state of the EU you might see that there is a lot of distrust, with anti-EU parties winning in the elections, etc.

No shit Sherlock..;) What I was trying to convey is that there has been a gradual change of attitude and acceptance. Almost as if Germans were slowly, carefully approaching music that didn't sit well with them before. There are many reasons, and I am not going to get into an cultural argument here, because that would indeed be a very long conversation.

Regarding your second point: I think it's precisely what you refer to as German folk music that is a) referred to in the movie, and b) slumbering, awaiting a fresh makeover as exemplified by that last song in the trailer I mentioned.

As you can read from the Wiki-article, I've linked above, this wine is made of both fresh grapes and raisin. The amount of raisins is what is measured with the ""x-buttig"", which seems to be a scale for the amount of raisins, which are added to the fresh grapes. More raisins mean sweeter.

""Trockenbeerenanteil"" is a bit a technocratic expression for ""amount of raisins per part"". ""Raisins"" are simply ""Rosinen"" in Germany, but could be also circumscribed as ""Trockenbeeren"" (""dried grapes"").

The differences are superficial. Three monotheistic religions talking about the same God, in parts involving the same people. Jesus, Arch angel Gabriel etc all show up in the Quran. Maria is mentioned more often in the Quran than in the bible. 

edit: The cultural differences are not as big as they seem. Cultures don't develop in a straight lines. During the [Islamic Golden Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age), the muslim world was far ahead of us in terms of science, math and even enlightenment. Many of the arguments for being able to combine God and science, that there has to be no conflict first came up in the muslim world. Fibonacci, Kopernikus were decidedly influenced by muslim scholars.

The development of Islam is in parts also a reaction to outside aggression. When the first crusaders landed in Jerusalem, they killed virtually all people in the city. Parts of contemporary radical islam are a clear answer to western aggression and meddling. 

Meanwhile, many western countries are also starting to develop backwards. Imprisonment without trial, torture in the US. Net censorship everywhere.

Ok, but that's essentially because lots of people have said ""cos I said so"" - it's a legal right that way, not any sort of inherent or forever unchanging right.

&gt;This way I do not have to rely on some conception of ""natural rights"".

Indeed you don't, but you can't argue with more than facts. If you say ""water is a human right"" without relying on natural rights then the only answer to that is to look up the legal books and find out if it is or isn't. The concept of the value of rights is, I would argue, somewhat lost that way.

&gt;First of all, I do not claim that water is a human right. I might argue that it should be a human right, though.

You're being smart there.

&gt;Second, quoting Wikipedia, ""These rights may exist as natural rights or as legal rights, in both national and international law."" Following the second definition, I claim that it is a human right the moment it is declared a human right by the General Assembly.

Ok, fair enough. You're still kind of dodging the question. I mean a legal right is supposed to be codified right of a non-legal kind. This seems kind of like the whole recourse to God ""Well god started it all"" thing that christians do.

&gt;based on the lowest common denominators already recognized/agreed upon in the human rights treaties

The words may be agreed on but I assure you debate rages as to what those words mean.

&gt;In the end, however, I think it does come down to ""let's agree that humans should have this as a right."" 

From your stance yes, if you do not believe in/refuse to engage in natural rights, then all you're really left with is ""wouldn't it be nice if everyone could have x"", to which I can simply retort ""yes, but xyz"" instead of needing to defeat a rights based argument, which is considerably harder.

I suppose my point here is that that rights tend to be treated as inviolable. Now while I'm not attacking you for this, you've conflated legal and natural rights, and legal rights have the strange quality of being inviolable for the short period that that law exists in history. So while natural rights convey some sort of really unmoving justification for a something, a justification which is deeper and sounder than any law ever could be, legal rights are by their nature flimsy and liable to alteration, and so to argue something is a ""right"" but to mean legal right is to not say more than ""wouldn't it be nice if x"", which is not really the definition of ""rights"" most would agree on, I think.

One single data point doesn't data make. Sure you can find some blond Romanians, you can find some blond Arabs too.

&gt; Also, a brunette one here.


This is what I'm talking about, more Romanians look more like this girl or like your Eurovision [contestant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEwJrFmMxrg) than the previous one.

OK, whatever.

&gt; Romanians are not closer to gypsies than Hungarians, 

But Romanians kept Romanis as slaves. Surely that means some interbreeding took place like it happened in Brazil. Isn't that the case?

&gt;  Romanian culture aligns itself to European culture. 

Romanian culture is Southern, similar to what you can find in Sicily for example, but also more Oriental in nature. A Romanian will feel more at home in Turkey than in Sweden.

Are Romanians godless like the French are? [This](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Europe_belief_in_god.svg/2000px-Europe_belief_in_god.svg.png) map seems to show that Romania is as religious as Islamic Turkey,  France is at the other end of the spectrum.

&gt; Romania has been a francophone country, and we even have the law system and the constitution based on that of France, and the educational system, with the Bacalaureate diploma.

The same can be said about many African nations too.

*The exercise centered on repelling an attack launched from Poland and Lithuania, and included the simulated use of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles.*

source: cable from US ambassador to NATO (wikileaks)

On the other hand, our exercises (Anakonda 12):

*Ćwiczenia odbywają się na lądzie, w powietrzu i na morzu. Ich scenariusz zakłada wystąpienie konfliktu zbrojnego z tytułu roszczeń terytorialnych ze strony państw sąsiadujących.*

I don't see much difference, and Russian side reaction to our exercises is exactly the same.

You don't feel comfortable living near authoritarian country with nuclear missiles. Maybe because you don't see that using these missiles would be suicidal for that country and it would spark global conflict which is not in Russia's interest. You should also read NATO conclusions about the exercises:

*The exercises demonstrated that Russia has limited capability for joint operations with air forces, continues to rely on aging and obsolete equipment, lacks all-weather capability and strategic transportation means, is not able to conduct network centric warfare, has an officer corps lacking flexibility, and has a manpower shortage.*

*NATO IMS concluded that Russian armed forces were: able to respond to a small to mid-sized local and regional conflict in its western region; not able to respond to two small conflicts in different geographical areas simultaneously; not able to conduct large scale conventional operations; and still relying on the use of tactical nuclear weapons, even in local or regional conflicts.*

Miller did simple cost/benefit analysis and concluded that the pipe to Norway won't benefit us. Cost of the construction would be high and Norwegian gas was (and still is) more expensive than Russian.

I remind you, that war in Georgia started and concluded during Bush presidency. What war do you have in mind?

Also,  the ""un-"" rule for negating adjectives is unfortunately not as general as it may sound in skotov's statement. It works with many adjectives, but by no means does it apply to all of them, though people would probably understand what you mean, and perhaps even find it cute, it would not be correct German. To make things even more ~~complicated~~ fun, there are also adjectives that start with un- where you cannot simply remove the un- to have the opposite meaning.

Some where you can't: grausam, geisteskrank,habgierig, gnadenlos

**Brexit: Europe loses patience with London**
By Philip Stephens


The story of British disengagement from the EU is often told as one of a proud island nation struggling to unshackle itself from its neighbours. The political dynamics, though, are changing. As David Cameron’s government shuns the closer integration born of the euro crisis, British pull is now being reinforced by continental push. 


European leaders at this week’s Brussels summit have other things on their minds – Greece, Spain and banking union among them. The future of the euro is not yet assured. Mr Cameron has chosen the role of bystander. And yet the outcome of the deliberations could well give another important nudge towards Britain’s departure from the EU.


The prime minister insists that he still backs membership, albeit on renegotiated terms. In a telephone conversation this week with Angela Merkel, he gently chided the German chancellor for scuppering the Europe-wide defence industry co-operation promised by a takeover of BAE Systems by EADS. Nick Clegg, Mr Cameron’s Liberal Democrat coalition partner, counts himself a staunch pro-European. Labour’s Ed Miliband castigates the government for self-imposed isolation in Europe. 


Mr Cameron, however, is a prisoner of his party’s anti-Europeans. As they ride the tide of public opinion, he fears the alternative to retreat from the EU is an irrevocable Conservative split. Mr Clegg has proved an inadequate brake on Tory hostility; and Mr Miliband refuses to risk unpopularity by staking political capital on Europe. Beyond the realm of politics, investors in Britain have been slow to wake up to the implications of what the Centre for European Reform has dubbed “Brexit”.


Missing from the domestic debate has been any recognition of the change of mood among other Europeans. In their demands for special treatment, the calculation of successive British governments has been that more federally-minded Europeans would bend to the threat of Britain’s departure. There was some truth in this. But the euro crisis has presented these leaders with more urgent priorities than indulging the veto-waving British.


Soon after Mr Cameron’s coalition was established in the summer of 2010, one of his more stridently eurosceptic ministers was reported to have said that there was no longer a need for Britain to leave Europe because Europe was leaving Britain. The observation has turned out to be more prescient than he imagined. 


Europe has tired of London’s demands for exemptions and opt-outs from the rules of the Union. Other leaders have serious business to transact to rescue the euro. If Britain wants out, continental politicians are now heard to say, it should get out. 


The prime minister promises a “big speech” on the subject sometime soon. He wants to set out the terms for a new relationship. The plan is to negotiate a series of concessions as the price for British consent to the treaty changes the euro group will need for deeper integration. The package could then be put to the British people in a referendum.


There are several snags to this scenario. The most obvious is that the government is running out of things from which to “opt out”. It is outside the euro and, unlike say Poland, has no intention ever of joining. It has declined to be part of a fiscal pact or banking union. Mr Cameron wants a two-tier budget to separate Britain’s contributions to Brussels from eurozone spending. 


Britain has long shunned the Schengen open borders arrangement. Now Mr Cameron plans to withdraw from EU-wide co-operation on matters of crime and justice. Beyond the single market and external trade policy – red lines for everyone else – this leaves precious little left from which Britain can exclude itself.


Another problem lies in the presumption that others will be malleable. In truth, the veto has lost its potency. When Britain deployed it in December last year, eurozone leaders simply created a parallel structure for fiscal co-operation. In France there is positive enthusiasm for such an approach. Germany would once have made an effort to accommodate British exceptionalism. But Ms Merkel has lost patience. 


She is far from alone. Mr Cameron has ignored overtures from Mario Monti, the Italian prime minister, for closer co-operation in single market policy. Mariano Rajoy, the centre-right Spanish leader, looks to Berlin rather than London. François Hollande, France’s Socialist president, was never going to be a close chum. Britain’s point-blank refusal to contribute to any of the support mechanisms for the euro has baffled even close allies such as Sweden. Others confess they are tired of British lectures about how they should order their affairs.


Mr Cameron’s administration has run out of what political scientists call “soft power”. The reservoir of goodwill is dry. When Britain demands assurances that the new banking union will not undercut its own influence over financial regulation, others ask why London should remain the continent’s pre-eminent financial centre.


There have been many crises in Britain’s relationship with the EU. This one feels very different. The arrangements for banking regulation may provide a template for a new institutional architecture that effectively excludes Britain from decision-making across the single market. The consequence would be to leave Britain in a position not dissimilar to that of EU outsiders such as Norway and Switzerland – bound by the rules and to pay their dues but unable to shape anything.


Mr Cameron is said to be drawing a road map for Britain’s future in Europe. He has failed to notice that, as they strike out in the other direction of closer union, his partners are content to say goodbye.",0,1350640030,null,0,false,0,c6oqzz0,t3_11qo1q,t1_c6oqzz0,t3_11qo1q,null,1430187382,31,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,31

Well, if they all lived in one country their voice will be harder to ignore, now it's easy to dismiss their concerns when they live dispersed all over Europe. So if they had sufficient numbers they could sway the political process and elect representatives that could set social policies to help them rise from poverty. And Romania already has the largest number of Romas in Europe so if more would arrive the tipping point could be reached. Pragmatically speaking, it seems like a good solution.

It's the only way the European countries can compete with the USA and China in the long run. Germany might be powerful at the moment, but how long can we keep up with the other countries? We will fall back, when India, China and Brasil continue to rise economically and politically.

Some of this is already happening (there is a EU ministery of state), but before we go any further we have to democatisize the EU. It shouldn't be allowed that France, the UK and Germany define the foreign policy in backroom politics and nobody knows what's happening.

I did say that it's more than likely that some Roma did this.

Everybody just tries to do what's best for his/her country but not what's best for all of them and the bigger countries are blackmailing the smaller ones.

Up until now there is no coordianted finance policy in Europe. It's just one backroom deal after another and this needs to change. A monetary union with no fiscal union doesn't work and that's exactly what happend with the Euro.

About fishing and farming regulations and stuff like that: If every country does these things by itself, what about subsudies? What prevents a big country like germany to heavily subsudy it's agricultural products and just export them and crush the farmers in, let's say, Belgium? As a consequence Belgium will raise customs to protect it's own ecenomy and we have no economic union at all anymore (I'm exaggerating).

There are two ways right now: Either we go backwards and each country isolates itself which worked for Iceland very well or we go forward and tie ourselfs together in one more democratic EU which is more difficult but will also gain us more power (economically and politically) to deal with the other big countries in the word (the EU is the biggest economy the planet has ever seen).

Obviously I don't think so.

&gt; Firstly, population transfers are not considered acceptable any more 

I'm not talking about forced relocation, Roma people could peacefully settle in Romania. I know there was a partnership between Romania and Germany so that the Germans living in Romania were able to voluntary return to Germany. Couldn't a similar thing happen in reverse?  Incentives could be given to Roma to move to Romania and  to Romania to accept them. It seems like a win-win for both, Romania could replace the missing Germans with the Romas and Romas could live in a country where their presence is well-established.

&gt; Secondly, people do get swarthier as you go south, but the difference between Romania and Hungary isn't really that much. Based on this, why not Italy, Greece or Turkey?

Form my point of view, as a German (and Bavarian), we need to change our perception. Germany didn't exist before 1871. We were a bunch of loosely tied countries with roughly the same language. Now we are a unified Germany and compared to France we are very federalised (Federal Republic of Germany). What does this mean? If you asked a Bavarian around 1950 he would have said ""Germany? Bullshit, I am Bavarian, we should have our own state because we have nothing to do with Prussia"" (Bavaria even voted against the Grundgesetz) but now we have no problems with it anymore. Of course there is arguing (and there should be) but overall we are glad to be part of Germany.

Which concepts are those?

&gt;I was trying to make the point that if something is a requirement of life itself, not a standard of life or a desire or anything like that, then it should be given strong consideration as a right.

And I was making the point that legal ""rights"" are a different animal from the concept of natural rights, and that to conflate the two waters down the power of the idea of the latter.

&gt;I was going to bring up Bechtels antics in Bolivia, as well as various more recent legal cases where people were prosecuted and jailed for collecting rainwater. That's what I was alluding to when I mentioned water falling freely from the sky. I had hoped it would be a prelude to a more involved conversation.

In that case I probably overstepped the mark in my reply, I thought you were harking back to an Alex Salmond type comment in which he ridiculed the idea of paying for drinking water, because it falls out of the sky for free (which is quite obviously retarded).

If you really were the masters of your own fiscal matters that would make sense but since British banking is in no small part dependent on the continent there is a strong codependency. Spanish houses and Greek insurances are just as much a problem for British banks as they are for continental banks and they are traded in euro's so the implication that there is such a thing as British fiscal independence is a bit of an illusion. In effect the British isolationist stance on the euro only results in *less* British independence as the British banks are reliant on policy shaped by non-British governments. To argue that British isolation is a solid policy, or even the only policy to make sense to people with a brain is thus clearly doubtful (and probably just parroting Tory rhetoric).",0,1350649133,null,0,false,0,c6orwmg,t3_11qo1q,t1_c6orwmg,t1_c6orsn3,null,1430187808,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

true,dibity,null,null,"Paris can be a difficult city for running depending on where you start from. There are whole neighborhoods where it would take at least 2 or 3 km just to get to a spot where you are not constantly being bothered by cars. 

I hate running in circles so I tend to do large loops or ""out and backs"". These are the places/routes that I would recommend. Some of these have been mentioned already and, if you are looking to do some longer runs, several of them can be combined with one another. 

- **Bois de boulogne:** endless options

- **Bois de vincennes:** endless options (this can be combined with the route below depending on the distance you want). 

- **La coulee verte/promenade plantee:** From Bastille, head down ave Daumesnil (stay below the elevated section of the la coulee verte/promenade plantee which is impossible to run on if there are other people) until the jardin de reuilly where it opens up. This continues to the bois de vincennes. If you are looking for a longer run (around 20k) I suggest taking this route to the bois and then heading down to Nogent sur Marne, following the river to Joinville le pont and then coming back past the horse track. I personally like doing this run late on Sunday mornings and ending at the Bastille market to pick up some lunch. There is a great little Lebanese place that serves a very authentic Manoushi (which they call Thyme for the French market). 

- **Buttes-Chaumont:** This is one of the nicest park in Paris for running, but rather hilly and can get crowded at peak times. I take this route often and combine it with the canal de l'ourcq (see below) to make a large loop that can be around 8km starting from Colonel Fabien or Stalingrad.

- **La Villette/Canal de l'ourcq:** This is a nice place for running especially in the early morning or around sunset as the sky tends to be beautiful. It can be rather crowded from Stalingrad to La Villette, but except at really peak times there is plenty of room to maneuver. After La Villette you cross under the peripherique and get into Pantin. It is fairly industrial, but the canal goes out about 30 km offering you about as much distance as you could ever want without ever crossing streets or encountering cars. 

- **Banks of the Seine:**: There are areas along the Seine that are not bad for running, but almost all of the areas have a lot of street crossings. The one exception is on Sunday mornings when the close the road along the Seine to trafffic from Arsenal (near Bastille) to the Louvre. 

- **Monceau, Luxembourg, Montsouris, and Tuileries:** These are all fine parks to run in if you don't mind going in circles. 

- **The rest of Paris:** Very early in the morning or on Sundays, you can get away with a short run elsewhere in the city, but generally speaking there are far too many people and cars to make running worthwhile or enjoyable.

3. The British have an odd sense of fair play, if we create rules we like to stick by them. Indeed the Uk has done a reasonable job of goldplating EU legislation. France (and others) seem to make the rules and then ignore them. This perception pisses off a lot of people (not least see Maastricht).

4. The EU is a not very democratic and as we have seen in Italy and Greece when push comes to shove the Establishment Knows Best(tm)

5. Many of the older British folk who were able to vote on EU membership felt they were missold. They mainly wanted a free trade area and instead ended up with the threat of political union.

true,G_Morgan,WALE,Wales,"&gt; Missing from the domestic debate has been any recognition of the change of mood among other Europeans. In their demands for special treatment, the calculation of successive British governments has been that more federally-minded Europeans would bend to the threat of Britain’s departure. There was some truth in this. But the euro crisis has presented these leaders with more urgent priorities than indulging the veto-waving British.

Part of this is previous changes we've enforced on Europe have been unquestionably good. Forcing the French to end the rule of closed cliques. The establishment of a proper democratic body. Opening up the market for trade. It is all a good idea and people recognise it even if we've essentially bullied the French block into accepting it. The politics in Europe are weird. People fed up with the way France operates wanted Britain to bully the union a bit (provided the goal was sensible). It gives political room to do what had to be done.

Cameron did not do anything that was fundamentally a good idea for Europe as a whole. He threw his weight around on entirely self interested grounds. He got nothing out of it as a result. Cameron actually believed Britain had more sway than it did. Now we have less than we actually had.

Agreed. The single market should also be a free market with minimal government intervention, we have no need for government subsidies that end up going to waste, that's incredibly inefficient.

&gt;the EU reeks of the same old corruption that we see in the Club Med countries.

It does? From my perspective, EU corruption is meaningless, comparable to that of the UK or France - it's there but it's hardly a factor.

&gt;The EU is a not very democratic and as we have seen in Italy and Greece when push comes to shove the Establishment Knows Best(tm)

In both those cases, the situation on the national level was at a standstill. Not anti-democratic as the EU institutions are democratic and every EU member-state must be a functioning democracy.

People saying ""oh, Monti wasn't elected"" or ""I didn't vote for Barroso"", that's taking this out of proportion - sure, the system could be improved, but even the UK itself has a ruling monarch and a House of Lords and even the House of Commons work in a FPTP system which on its own are serious flaws to democracy, and people seem to ignore these.

&gt;Given our culturual outlook it is harder for the UK to build alliances within the EU (e.g. free market v protectionism).

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; That's their own Netherlands Distortion and part of the reason why Greece is so &amp;%*%$£ !!!

No, it's not. As I said, Greece has a giant fleet of ships, they just don't usually dock at Greek ports. Look at a map, or the data I linked to above. It's almost entirely within the Mediterranean or the Black Sea, not transfer ports for shipping to or from Asia as you had said.

&gt; The alarm bells should be ringing when a gateway to Europe and first port of call in the Med from the East only added up to .2%. Clearly it's coming in that way and yet it's not going on a direct route to the UK.

Greek ports handled 88 million tonnes of cargo in 2010 (in and out), compared to the UK's 455 million tonnes. Because, geography. East of the Med is the Black Sea and not much else, as far as shipping is concerned. The 0.2% figure was the share of UK shipping to or from Greece.

Btw., ports in the Netherlands handled 538 million tonnes, not much more than the UK despite Rotterdam being the main access point towards the Continent via the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt Delta. Belgian (Antwerp etc.) is half that of the UK's. But I'm sure most of it is just transit of British goods anyway.

&gt; Great, we can be part of that and still outside the EU! Norway.

Yeah, you can simply accept EU regulations without bothering the EU members with the obstructions you like to put in the way of further integration. I think we cold agree on such a solution, I just think most of your countrymen wouldn't support it.

&gt;  The CAP and CFP isn't geared towards UK industries so those countries that do get a kick out of it get more. 

And you get the UK Rebate because of that. Or rather, you got it because at the time you were the third poorest member and the rebate was introduced to prevent you from becoming a net contributor because of that. But now that you're one of the rich ones, and nobody else of the 26 others gets it, it complicates matters.

&gt; Germany has certainly prospered by bringing Europe together from getting countries on the Euro...so that's the big countries and most of southern Europe accounted for.

Most definitely, as have many others. Credit for this goes to France, though.

&gt;  The ascension countries speak for themselves as net beneficiaries...

Ah, yes, the Structural Funds. The first thing the UK pushed for after joining. You're welcome.

&gt; The UK is one of the largest contributors and set to be the smallest recipient per capita than all of them, so obviously others are getting more out than what the UK is.

The UK is also one of the richest countries. It's the [7th largest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_the_European_Union#Net_contributors_and_recipients) contributor per capita or GDP, paying about half as much as Italy.

Did you see [this article](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/11qo1q/brexit_europe_loses_patience_with_london/), btw.? It has some more on British exceptions and is otherwise very relevant for this discussion as well.

&gt; Your argument isn't consistent, whereas I don't have to shift goalposts. Will it be damaging or not?

It will be politically damaging in the short term. The EU has more important things on the table right now. However, some believe it would be a net positive in the long run. I think that's possible, but there's no way to be sure.

&gt; a) they don't, that's a fallacy. There is no banana status quo.

I was being sarcastic. You're not actually growing bananas in the UK, I had thought this would give away the nature of this remark.

&gt; It does have to because it doesn't help the UK and the EU wants to go down the Federal route which the UK is steadfast against and can veto.

Well, we'll see about that.

It does. Only recently a health commisioner has resigned due to corruption. 

Why is EU corruption meaningless? We collectively pay for the EU and I strongly object to the MEPs and others pissing money against the wall. CAP is bad enough but to simply say ""suck it up it is irrelevant"" makes a mockery of it all.

A friend gave me [this link](http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/ps-ultimas-noticias-assis-clio-tvi24-carros/1382641-4071.html) relating to the behaviour of the Portuguese opposition party - to say the least I hope this behaviour never reaches the UK.

&gt; but even the UK itself has a ruling monarch and a House of Lords and even the House of Commons work in a FPTP system which on its own are serious flaws to democracy, and people seem to ignore these.

The monarch in the UK is ceremonial and has a minimal impact upon the political landscape. There is mooted talk of House of Lords reform but personally I'm all for having only one legislative chamber. 

As for FPTP I know it is not a popular thing on reddit but it is still a democratically valid approach to conducting elections. AV and PR allow for broader democratic representation and minority parties but they do lead to problems of their own. 

So yes, I agree the UK is not perfect but that does not and should not give carte blanche to the EU to behave autocratically and enable laws/treaties to be circumvented simply because they are inconvenient as has been happening since 2008 with stunning disregard for anything other than political expediency.

However, others will leap to the defence of ""National champions"" the first sign of anything going against the political interests.

Ca vient sans doute d'une mauvaise perception de ma part, mais quand j'ai commencé à aller sur reddit (début été 2006 si ma mémoire est bonne) un paquet de subreddits ""controversés"" n'étaient tout simplement pas là. Reddit a évolué, s'est modifié notamment via l'addition de subreddits nombreux et variés.

&gt; Tu t'attendais à tomber sur du [NSFW] /r/WTF ou du [NSFW] /r/spacedicks ? Moi, non, et c'est en partie pour être surpris que je suis ici.

/r/WTF ne m'a jamais surpris (son contenu parfois oui, en même temps c'est un peu le but). Je me suis toujours demandé ce que spacedicks foutait là par exemple. Mais ça s'explique assez simplement en fait.

&gt; En fait, si je peux me permettre de t'expliquer principe fondamental de reddit : tu votes. Le pouvoir de décision s'arrête là. La communauté décide.

Tu te doutes bien que je connais le principe. Maintenant, si en terme de contenu visible dans un subreddit ou visible sur la homepage le système de décision de la communauté permet de valider (upvote) ou d'invalider (downvote) du contenu, le même système est différent quand il s'agit d'apprécier un subreddit.

En quoi peut-on mesurer l'approbation d'un subreddit par l'ensemble de la communauté ? La principale métrique est le nombre d'abonnés. Sauf qu'il s'agit d'un vote strictement positif. Tu ne peux pas dire : ""ce subreddit est à chier, je n'en veux pas"". Si l'audience potentielle d'un subreddit est suffisamment élevée, il pourra exister, indépendamment du fait que la communauté dans son ensemble en veuille ou non.

De fait, tu peux virtuellement foutre n'importe quoi sur reddit, pour peu qu'il y ait un faible pourcentage de la communauté qui peut s'y retrouver. Ça n'est pas négatif en soi, ça permet de faire exister des communautés de niche.

Maintenant, qu'est-ce qui est attendu du contenu de reddit ? A priori, les créateurs avaient quand même une vague idée derrière la tête. Et la communauté aussi. La soumission de lien est ainsi libellée : ""Soumettez un lien **vers quelque chose d'intéressant**"". La rediquette stipule une longue liste de comportements non-souhaités, qui inclut notamment le circlejerking et tout ce qui tourne autour, mais qui a surtout comme principe général : soyez un minimum civilisé.

C'est une façon plutôt ouverte de présenter les chose : sur reddit, il ne sera qu'interdit de faire des choses illégales, mais on demandera aux gens d'éviter de se comporter comme des connards et ce de façon beaucoup plus explicite que sur, mettons, 4chan.

C'est là qu'on commence à voir émerger une base sur laquelle juger certains subreddits et leur pertinence au sein de reddit. Circlejerk ? Les gens s'y comportent effectivement comme des connards, mais ce comportement est restreint à ce subreddit. Il ne fait de tort à personne. Spacedicks ? Même chose. Creepshots (et dans une certaine mesure Jailbait) ? Des photos sexualisantes prises à l'insu de personnes non consentantes (ou volées sur Facebook) et déballées sur Internet avec tout ce que ça peut avoir comme conséquences dans la vie la vraie.

He then traveled the world and made albums with influences from Africa and Tibet and stuff like that, then he turned to more traditional music again (Trad being the album with his most ""pure"" volksmusik I know of).

The Biermösl Blasn from Bavaria that sandrocket already mentioned has witty lyrics and traditional-sounding tunes and they worked with Gerhard Polt a lot, a well known German satirist/comedian. Mostly they try their hand at goofy, funny songs meant to get Bavarians thinking about why they voted for the same party the last 60 years, but some of their acoustic pieces are hauntingly beautiful. They also used a wiiide range of traditional and modern instruments.

One of the ""big names"" is haindling who mixes traditional with Jazz and other influences.

I don't see why. Turkey is a lovely country, Istanbul is a great modern city  and on average Turks are richer and more educated than Romanians.

I meant to say meaningless like in the UK or in France as in, it's not even mildly corrupt. Sure, there are a few cases here and there but that's with everything, you can't prevent all corruption just like you can't all other crimes. You mentioned something about an health commissioner, yeah, these things are bound to happen everywhere every once in a while - as long as everything is handled properly, thoroughly and justly, it should be fine, no?

&gt;We collectively pay for the EU and I strongly object to the MEPs and others pissing money against the wall.

That's true for everything and it should always be avoided.

This might not be the case there, but here the government tends to be much more inefficient than the EU one, we can't criticize the EU when our own government does much worse. :S

&gt;CAP is bad enough but to simply say ""suck it up it is irrelevant"" makes a mockery of it all.

CAP isn't irrelevant and it is bad enough. Again, I agree with you, though this can be fixed with reform, not with leaving the Union. That would cost us much more than several, highly inefficient CAPs.

&gt;A friend gave me this link relating to the behaviour of the Portuguese opposition party - to say the least I hope this behaviour never reaches the UK.

For your own sake, I agree. Damn socialists, not only did they fucked us up this bad, they still proudly hold their position that the government that rules best should rule over more and spend more, also, since they're now in the opposition, they started acting as spoiled brats and constantly try to destabilize the government and make the people revolt against the spending cuts that the government has to make, cuts which we wouldn't have the need to do if it wasn't for the socialist in the first place!

&gt;As for FPTP I know it is not a popular thing on reddit but it is still a democratically valid approach to conducting elections. AV and PR allow for broader democratic representation and minority parties but they do lead to problems of their own. 

FPTP is incredibly bad, it inevitably leads to a two party system and is very harmful to democracy. AV or PR are much much better.

Police isn't a business. Even if people could own and operate a police station, who would, if it's profit is zero?

Other examples include courts, fire fighters, civil defence and the military. Arguing against this is arguing for anarchy and against the state. That's retarded, there needs to be a party that represents us all and that legislates and protects us, that can't be provided by a private entity.

&gt;or healthcare

Healthcare can perfectly be privatised, if it was, it would be much more efficient and less of a burden to society. Though I'm of the opinion that most (if not all) of it should be government subsidized, as everyone should have access to it regardless of their financial situation in a time of need. That way we'd combine both the efficiency of a free market and make sure everybody has the access of it. This certainly seems like a better alternative of a state-owned healthcare system which has much less incentives to keep the costs down and working properly.

Another great example of this is education. It should be available to all but there's no need for it to be owned by the state as a bureaucrat can get away with doing a lousy job while asking for massive funding while a private entity has in his best interest to spend the least amount of money possible and to keep things efficient as the better the service he provides, the more he'd profit from it and the more society would also profit as the service would be of better quality and a lesser burden to the taxpayer.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;but this government is in power for a year and a half, and the budget for next year is the direct consequence of the ~~failed~~ policies they followed since then. 

Unfortunately you can't cure a debt accumulated for well more than a decade in 1.5 years, even 4 years is putting it slightly optimistic, in the mean time there's plenty of things of which we have no control and that can go wrong and delay us considerably.

This isn't only Sócrates' fault, it's an heritage that dates back to Cavaco and Mário Soares as PM. The thing about Sócrates is that he managed to do like they did and much worse. Even worse, by then we could no longer do like the former did and simply continue to devalue the escudo to pay for all of this.

And what do you mean by 'failed' policies? That's like saying Betadine is a failure because it burns and doesn't instantly patch up a leg that's all scratched and roughed up. Nobody ever said the austerity measures would be easy and it would be done in no time - just keep in mind that the alternative is a default on our debt, which would be much worse than austerity will ever be.

&gt;They had every chance of implementing their plan, there was extremely little protest, there was no real opposition on the parliament, and what is the result? The country is worse then when they come to power. All their policies failed, the debt is higher and the deficit, that was their only goal and the goal they kept saying was the reason for all the austerity is not the 4,5% it should be, is not the 5% of the troika revised target, is not even 6 or 6,5 is more than 7%, why? Was the ghost of socrates tormenting the dreams of the PM and not letting him work?

Again, it's not something that can be fixed in two years and obviously there needs to be a restructuring of the workforce. You can't afford supporting the massive state we had. This will inevitably lead to a short term increase of unemployment and less income for the state. The signs of recovery are starting to show up and exports are increasing - this might not be of any help to someone who lost his job but unfortunately the situation we had was unsustainable and did this is the fallout we're experiencing. It's in everyone's best interest to keep unemployment as low as possible, but we're so under pressure because of the over 100% of GDP debt and the economy not being able to grow that no help can be spared. You're absolutely right, a lot of mistakes are also being made, heck, the government increasing taxes now might hurt us much more in the long run than it might help them in the short term, but unfortunately it had to come to this difficult situation, a situation not fault of our current PM.

&gt;In 6 months when the country is in even deeper shit because of this budget that is by all accounts a insanity you will be saying is Socrates fault? When does it stop being Socrates fault and starts being thsi government retarded policies fault?

The government is also making a lot of mistakes, trying to cut back on spending won't be one of them. They have a four year term and we're not even halfway in. If by the end, things still aren't at least starting to be looking up, then they certainly fucked up badly along the way.

&gt;Even so, nothing prevents private healthcare providers to exist while you still have solidarity in a national health insurance.

No because it's not a free market if the government has a monopoly on free healthcare. You want solidarity, let the privates provide the service and let the state pay for it. The state both owning it and paying for it leads to inefficiency (and it shows) while giving no extra benefits.

&gt;Other things like railways simply don't offer as much possibilities to privatize. You can't let people build railways whereever they want and let them compete. That's just not possible.

The first railways in the UK and in the US were privately-owned. Though the times have changed and you're right, they aren't as profitable as they were in the past. Though my point remains, the privates have more incentives to make it work more efficiently than the state.
 
If the privates can't provide it because it's unsustainable and because demand is too low to make up for the costs, then it's not the role of the state to continue to support it. Why should the taxpayer and companies all pay for a defunct railway system which can't even pay for its own costs?

I'll be brief because I hate writing the same thing twice. Healthcare is a terrible example of system that would be better if privatized. It doesn't follow free market priciples for a number of reasons:

-Patients have no bargaining power on account of the fact that they are dying  
-Patients cannot shop around for the best deal while suffering a bust appendix. The closest hospital is the one that will be used.  
-Preventative care just doesn't happen as often when there are upfront costs. People want to ignore things as long as possible leading to problems spreading and becoming harder to treat.

A practical example is the US system vs the UK. The US with its privatised system pays ~8000$ a year per person and the UK with its nationalised system pays ~3000$ a year. [If you scroll down to the international comparisons section](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system) you will see that the two countries receive a similar level of care for their wildly differing costs.

It's up to you to prove the moon is made out of cheese, if you claim so. I'm not claiming that the state does always better, merely that it's not a given that privatization is better. In any case, you must have heard that healthcare expenses in the USA are much higher per capita than in the more publicly organized European systems.

&gt;No because it's not a free market if the government has a monopoly on free healthcare.

I don't care about the label. If people can choose the healthcare provider of their choice - within certain standards - you still have important (if not the most important) characteristics of a free market (customer choice, free enterprise, competition).

&gt;The first railways in the UK and in the US were privately-owned. Though the times have changed and you're right, they aren't as profitable as they were in the past.

At that point in time there was plenty of space - in particular in the USA. It's more difficult to do the same in today's densely built environments, and in particular because demand for public transport is the highest in places with the highest population density.

&gt;Though my point remains, the privates have more incentives to make it work more efficiently than the state.

If you accept that profitability is a measure of efficiency. The state gets the complaints about bad traffic anyway, doesn't matter which mode of transport they choose; if a train company turns a profit, there's nothing wrong according to them, even if there are traffic jams from dusk till dawn every day.

&gt;If the privates can't provide it because it's unsustainable and because demand is too low to make up for the costs, then it's not the role of the state to continue to support it

The problem is that we have a kind of path dependency here. If cars are the normal means of transport, then spatial organisation will form itself around the assumption that everyone has cars. You can't get out of that alley by private enterprise. In that way, the market does not enable freedom of choice but hinders it.

&gt;Why should the taxpayer and companies all pay for a defunct railway system which can't even pay for its own costs? [...]

Why should the taxpayer pay for automobile infrastructure?

It seems you didn't read my post when I said:
&gt;Though I'm of the opinion that most (if not all) of it should be government subsidized, as everyone should have access to it regardless of their financial situation in a time of need.

My system is indeed a privatized healthcare, though it's irrelevant for the user if it's privately or state owned, as in both cases, it's paid by the taxpayers and at minimal or with no expense to the patients individually.

&gt;Education has its own problems, namely that in a free market rich people spend more money on education for their children and poor people less. This reduces social mobility, stops poor children from being able to work their way out of poverty due to lack of good education and causes many other problems.

What the heck, are you guys not reading my posts? I also said I was in favour of a state-funded education. In fact, wasn't it for state-funds, I wouldn't be able to afford university, and just like me, my parents as well. What I'm arguing for it for the private sector to own it and make it more much more efficiently and without being such a burden for the taxpayers, as the only expense for the state in this system would be to pay the tuition fees, the costs for the students individually would remain minimal.

Again, in these examples of healthcare and education, I'm all for making it available to everybody through the taxpayers, it's just that it still can be a great burden to society and if you had private entities managing them and leave only the state to pay the bill, the whole process would be cheaper and/or of higher quality.",0,1350663998,null,0,false,0,c6ov1yq,t3_11qo1q,t1_c6ov1yq,t1_c6ou6p1,null,1430189358,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

It intuitively makes sense. The only risk lending to the currency creator is inflation - and inflation is a risk no matter who you lend that currency to, and as such you'd be mad to charge the government higher interest than any other entity. If the government's setting the overnight bank lending rate at 0% it puts a very real effective ceiling on what the government can be charged on its bonds.

Additionally it opens new options. ie, ZIRPs are a sign of a reserve bank unable to sufficient money into the economy to keep employment high. If you own the currency - you can (but nobody does) - give them new ways to put money into the economy such as a [job guarantee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_guarantee) system.

I claimed something perfectly reasonable and argued for it, you just went ""hurr, your facts are just beliefs"".

&gt;In any case, you must have heard that healthcare expenses in the USA are much higher per capita than in the more publicly organized European systems.

We also pay massively in taxes and they're involved in wars and have much more weapons and fatness than we do. No wonder they spend more than us per capita. Also, do notice that, per capita, at least Portugal, we're poorer, so it's not like we'd be able to afford it anyway.

Regardless, it doesn't refute what I said - if you were managing an hospital and had fixed pay by the state, regardless of how many patients you treated, how nicely you treated them and the costs of it, you'd have no significant benefits to making it work efficiently; if instead you owned the hospital and the state only intervened to regulate your activity and pay the medical expenses of your patients, then it would be in your best interest to lower costs and to treat the highest amount of patients possible because if you did a lousy job, they'd just go to another hospital and you'd make less money. Now tell me if this is like claiming the moon is made of cheese.

&gt;If people can choose the healthcare provider of their choice - within certain standards - you still have important (if not the most important) characteristics of a free market (customer choice, free enterprise, competition).

Either only the public hospitals were available to everyone which would be unfair to the private ones, they wouldn't be able to complete with the state if the state charged its patients 0€ or every hospital would have the same subsidies and the free market on its own would make sure the public hospitals close down because the privates would be offering the same service with higher quality or presenting lower maintenance costs and an inefficiently run state-owned hospital wouldn't survive the competitions presented by the private sector.

&gt;If you accept that profitability is a measure of efficiency.

Isn't it?

&gt;The state gets the complaints about bad traffic anyway, doesn't matter which mode of transport they choose; if a train company turns a profit, there's nothing wrong according to them, even if there are traffic jams from dusk till dawn every day.

There isn't nothing wrong with the train company if it presents profits, if the streets are jammed, then there's probably an inefficient road-system. I don't think I get the point you're trying to make, though..

&gt;The problem is that we have a kind of path dependency here. If cars are the normal means of transport, then spatial organisation will form itself around the assumption that everyone has cars. You can't get out of that alley by private enterprise.

That's still more efficient than to provide everything for everyone through taxes. That problem is meaningless if you're saving employment and making your economy more competitive and everyone is overall benefiting much more than they would if they had others more inefficient means of transportation which were unsustainable on their own and a net expense for society.

China. Domestic producers in southern European countries have been hit by ever increasing competition coming from China and other developing countries. This has nothing to do with value of Euro, as producers in developing countries have such a high scale of economy and cost advantage that devaluations or increase of pay in countries such as Germany wouldn't help a bit.

One could speculate that allowing property bubble to build up in Spain and states to expand in Greece, Portugal and Italy were failed tries to save the economy.

Many ways, different countries have different problems, but the source of all these problems is inability of the political system to acknowledge the truth, and act on upon it.

We are too self centred. We should be asking what the rest of the world is doing, and where are they going.

Instead they went for the idiotic short term goal of wiping out all spending with no plans of growth or sustainability. What did they think would happen in this scenario?

Therefore ""regular"" polling stations are open to all, ""special"" polling stations are ""cops only"" and use *special* lists . Special is an exception, not the rule.

For your so-called ""special"" polling stations, where both policemen and citizens vote, you wrote:

Unlike the communists/socialists, they think that concentrating power in the hands of the state is just as bad as concentrating power in the hands of the capitalists. 

Their solution is to devolve the power as close as possible to the people, which means community autonomy, direct democracy, common (i.e. workers') ownership of the means of production.

Tsipras combines youthfulness with A. Papandreou's (former PM's father) rhetoric. It doesn't matter if he makes a sound case or not (he has some good points, but even he knows he can't always have his cake and eat it too). People in need always want to catch a glimpse of hope.

I don't foresee elections. Even Tsipras left hints about it, saying that they'll demand elections when they're able to enforce them. They're trying to unify their party now; officially, this will happen next year. Next up, local government and EU elections (2014), and choosing the next President of the Republic (2015). They could try and take down the government during this procedure, as the government needs 180 votes in the Parliament.

In any case, I don't see SYRIZA maintaining the percentages polls are giving them now. There are talks about a centrist party that would take votes from all sides of the political spectrum.  There's always the case of SYRIZA trying to form a minority government, although that would be suicidal. Maybe they would try again with DIMAR (Democratic Left).

Do you understand [why](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20002553) the UK is being pushed out? With decades of membership, we have achieved nothing within the EU. The CAP is still present. The common fisheries policy ruined our fish stocks. And it looks like our financial services industry is next on the menu.

We never wanted to be part of a Federal Union, and when we try to alter the EU's course away from that direction, all it does cause complaints. Why are we even in it? We are making absolutely no difference, we have absolutely no say, except through use of the veto, which only frustrates people.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;If the fiscal multiplier is higher than 1

That 'if' is quite nasty. Yes, the IMF can argue a lot for it, but the results showcase another reality - Portugal's debt to GDP ratio is now over 100% and we've had public deficits of ~5%/year - if we had a fiscal multiplier over than 1, our GDP would have increased at least 5% year, when it has been around 1% and there have been even years like 2008 where the economy actually shrank.

Austerity both shrinks the economy because of reducing public spending and expands it if while the state is cutting costs, it also reduces taxation. Our major problem was not only having a runaway public spending, it was that spending not being worthwhile investments. Two flagrant examples are that we built [roads going nowhere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_road_network_size) where there's an average of 2 cars per hour during daytime and [stadiums everywhere](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=awSfYB6pE3fY) for Euro 2004 whose only purpose was that event.

Obviously that if a government used taxpayer's money to make an investment that for some reason the private sector can't make, then fine, do it, it would benefit more than it would cost the whole of society, right? Our problem was that we got this debt in worthless junk, in simple 'fireworks' and in pandering to get votes and secure elections.

The last question, at the bottom of the PDF is I think the most relevant. Basically the majority says that the UK should wait and see what happens with the EU, and then do something.

Scrolling back, the majority wants to renegotiate the treaty (after waiting and observing the EU), and if the renegotiations are said to have been successful, then the majority would vote to stay within the EU. If there are no negotiations whatsoever, then more people than not would want to leave the EU, but they don't make 50% so the undecided will be the most important.

The point is these referendums might not even happen because the majority wants to wait and see what happens. So unless the EU kicks Britain out (which it can't), I don't think Britain will leave on its own.

We had decades of overspending, you can't just say that from now on things will be dealt with properly and that's it, you also need to clean up the mess you made. Unfortunately, on the short term, that might end up in things losing some funding as currently it's very expensive to get funding and the last thing you need it the debt piling on even more.

Taxes are also being increased which the worst thing you should do in this situation but I guess things got to be this bad and desperate times call for desperate measures. Though everyone is worried if the short term gain of this will make up for the losses on the long term.

&gt;The argument is that the austerity measures used right now do nothing to help but actually make the problems worse.

Austerity is simply cutting back on the spending. Considering that it was excessive spending that got us in this position and that more spending is financial suicide, while austerity alone won't save us, it will stop us from dying.

true,triceratopos,null,null,"What is unnecessary spending? Everything you don't perceive as having a direct impact on people's welfare? Even military expenditure has a multiplier. Slashing the wages of a soldier, or downright sacking me, can result in a family member of said soldier being unable to pay for adequate treatment. Is that a better solution? Every choice, in this scenario, will have have undesired side-effects. Are you going to argue that military expenditure results in a benefit to exporting countries such as Germany? The same happens when consumer spending is incentivized. Also, if you're going to argue about fiscal multipliers, you really need to understand that there's an opportunity cost associated with every kind of expenditure. It's also pretty obvious that shrinking government expenditure has a negative short-term impact on GDP. But, when funds are scarce, there are no willing contributors and in the presence of a fixed exchange regime, attempting to increase the public deficit is not very different from getting a car without gas to move with willpower alone.

Assuming a fiscal multiplier of 1.5 doesn't really say much when resources are possibly being shifted away from other sectors of the economy, which can have higher multipliers. Fiscal expansion is an useful tool to smooth economic volatility, but it's not a be all and end all solution to economic growth. Resources aren't fixed in time, you might not pay the bill now, but someone will pay eventually. Even if German tax payers end up getting stuck with it, how much fairer is that, exactly? What do you exactly think is happening in Greece and Portugal anyway? Domestic households are being forced to pay for excessive past expenditure since foreigners are no longer WILLING to lend. Unless a country can forcefully acquire more resources than it requires (pretty much impossible, but hypothetically), there will always be constraints on spending, like it or not. It's pretty easy to point the figure and look for a scape-goat, hindsight is always 20/20, right? In the end, all the parties involved have entered into contracts and if there were any wrongdoings, legal mechanisms should be applied or improved to deal with the situation in order to discourage moral hazard. 

Does it matter that Merkel would not pursue ""austerity"" at home? No. Investors are willing to lend to Germany, regardless of deficits. There is no coercion. Why? Germany has shown it is able to invest properly and increase productivity. That is all that matter to investors. Would you want to invest in a sinking ship with your life's savings? Why German investment results in productivity increases and why the same hasn't been true in part of the periphery is an important topic, but is only partially influenced by the EMU and EU. Rioting is not going to change this reality. 

Regardless, is it morally acceptable to continue to bet the earnings of future workers for unsustainable welfare in the present? Productive investment should take precedence, always, as it generates future wealth with the cost being borne by future generations, which is morally acceptable. Arguing for present welfare without taking into consideration debt dynamics under a blanket of ""necessity"" is a very poor argument. Necessity or no necessity, resource constraints still apply. This blame game is fairly counterproductive, people need to stick with reality and avoid distorting, yet comforting, fantasies.",0,1350695219,null,0,1350695449,0,c6p2vc6,t3_11r4ye,t1_c6p2vc6,t1_c6p1664,null,1430193107,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,TheMania,null,null,"You assume deficit spending would be inflationary yet it's far more complicated than that. If there's high savings desire by the populace increasing the money supply just ends up going back into the banks, and not being spent on goods/services pushing up the price level. Just look at Japan - massive deficits for an entire decade and they were experiencing *deflation*. US today, massive deficits yet the Fed's having to QE trillions to even reach their minimum inflation target. This will always tend to be the case whilst you have high unemployment - if it's being spent on goods/services the private sector will grow to absorb the extra cash, if it's being put into savings it can hardly affect the price level.

Government spending past full employment would be inflationary mind - as the economy could not support that - and that's when it becomes an indirect tax. But who's arguing for that?

It's a flawed assumption in other words.

But that aside, even if it *were* inflationary - say 4% - I'd much rather live in a fully employed nation consuming all it can produce and experiencing 4% inflation than a country with 16% unemployment, massive lost output - and worse, 30%+ youth unemployment.

true,MadManWithTinFoil,BAVA,Bavaria,"&gt;All of this could of been avoided by Merkel and her idiot followers if they used some common sense.

Hi usually this is the point where the other sides tells your why and where you are wrong. 
But I want to try something different today and explain you the German position.

1.) We are not going to  subsidize the Greece living standard, ever. Period. We organize our communities differently and pay for it differently. Greeks may enjoyed different things Germans had to cut in our Agenda2010. We pay and payed different taxes and live under different rules. The German taxpayer will not accept such reallocation of wealth in this way. The bailout money is a temporary aide because you are looked out of the financial market. 

Also keep in mind, I am trying to explain the German position (from my perspective). I am not saying you asked for it, but this is one of the biggest concerns of the German Taxpayers. 


2.)
The Money from the bailouts is not there to help the People of Greece, you get those pay your debts. They should give you the ability to avoid a default. You already spent that money. 
We are buying you time, nothing more, nothing less.

3.)

The Germans can't fix your economy. You have to fix it yourself. I know that it is popular to think that Germany would love to rule over Europe, but it is not ruling Europe.
We can't decided the politics in your country. We give you very strict conditions for the bailouts, because we want to make sure that those are not permanent transfers. You are not forced to take it.
And something more important, we don't implement it.

We only hear about cuttings, but not about the needed reforms. 
While decreasing your spendings is a good thing (Countries poorer than yours have to pay for your Bailouts.) and you simply need to spent a reasonable amount of money.
But personally those Reforms are much, much more important. 
Your Politicians have to implement it, those will make things better in your country. 

4.) 

Let's be honest you are not able to pay back your debts and never will.
No one can change it and we all should accept it. 
The compound interest  (thanks to frieswithketchup for telling me the translation of Zinseszins) alone is to much. 
The forced haircut was not enough, it is obvious. 
Luckily most of your debt is owned by the ECB (afaik).
There is no risk of a new banking crisis for the next haircut.


5.)

Sadly there is no trust for the crisis countries. 
You had more than a decade of cheap loans, because of the Euro.
Your politicians decided to use it for increasing wages.
It probably raised their changes of reelection, but this was a great opportunity you missed. 
There was another country called ""Sick man of Europe"" who decided to Reform itself during that time. 

6.)

Take at least one secound to ask yourself if Germany can afford to bailout Europe.
This is something the whole Eurozone should question. 
Even if we would want to pay for the EZ, we couldn't.
Do you remember our Reunification? 
It didn't cost us 2 Trillion € and yet it nearly destroyed us. 
The west had to lower their living standard, and our national debt decreased immensely. 
The estimated Debt of the GIIPS countries are 14 Trillion €.
Get real! There is no way Germany could afford the demands of our Eurozone Partners. 

7.)

Don't assume we are wealthy because our Economy is in a good shape.
Yes we have it better than most countries. 
But the German is not that wealthy it seems. 
In fact the Households in Italy have more wealthy than those in Germany. 
And yet Germans are asked to sacrifice even more.
We have many issues in Germany, it starts with the lack of a minimum wages goes over the invention of ""Minijobs"" and Ends with our Pensions. 
Did you know that a lot of Germans retirees will not payed enough into our pensions founds to get more than a ""Grundsicherung"" ? 
It means they will get an average of 710€ as a pension. 
This is not going to work, and we will need to Reform our Pension system, which will need a ton of money.
 Thanks to our demographic change. 
It will get pretty damn expensive when we will need to change it.
I can already see retirees roaming Munich for some pfand on a daily basis. They need the money to make a few bucks more.
And it will get soooo much worse in Germany.
Don't ask for too much.


8.)
We have a lot of well integrated Greece people in Germany.
Quite a few of us have friends from Greece ancestry. 
At least I can call one Greek a friend, but He told me how things are in Greece. He told my about the way you do business in Greece or how You were considered as dumb for paying all of your taxes. 
Don't deny that mostly everyone participate in the tax dodging. 
Some of us know better. 

9.)


Europe denied Germany, Eastern Europe, Scandinavia and the Dutch 
any solidarity. Please stop asking for it. 
We still remember how the Spanish denied the German request to lower the amount Germany has to pay into the EU. 
The planning of our Reunification had some flaws, and we couldn't afford the whole amount we paid the EU to help other countries. 
The Spanish alread used it in their plans and denied us our wish.
Today we see how they used the money to build roads no one needs or Airports which will never see an Airplane take off. 
And they lecture us about solidarity? 

And this is the situation in Germany, do you know anything about the time after the Soviet Union, when East Europe become free and broke? 

I can only imagine what they think about solidarity. 
__________________________________________________


Those are only some of the German concerns. 
Maybe we could finally start a real discussion about it.
This will also give us the ability to listen to your concerns. 

Denying your responsibilities for the whole mess will not help you. 
You will not score points by the people who will pay for you.
I would like to see a honest demand for help.
You fucked it up in your country. 
Most people in Germany a scared about a lot of things and everyone ignores it.
There is also no doubt about that the things in Greece. They are not working as they should. Probably the Troika thought that your ""real"" economy is stronger than it actually is. There are a lot of issues in Greece and it would be great if we could also start a real discussion about it. 
It shouldn't surprise anyone that ""Austerity"" is not working like it is in other countries. To be an effective internal deflation Greece would need another 30% percents of Wages cuts. This is something no one can ask for. 
So it is clear that we will need some changes. 
And I tried to describe the German stance. 
Lets discuss it in a way we could all profit from. We are a special kind. We are scared easily, we care about things other Europeans don't think about because they will happen no matter what we will do. 

We have (thankfully) a great diversity in Europe. 
Keep that in mind. 
What seems logical to you, doesn't have to be logical to some one else and vice versa.
I hope that we all will continue to live together, but we have reached a status were both of us don't talk about things together.  
We yell at each other and that's it.


This is not going to work. It is somewhat understandable that you are mad. But not only do I think that your anger is pointed at the wrong persons, I also believe that it wont help.

It is 5:00 o'clock and I am a bit drunk, but I still want to finish my posting. I see at lot of problems in the Greek and German way. 
But I actually think that we need a discussion about it.
We should stop yelling at us and start understanding us.
IF your or any of your fellow Greece seems to be reasonable, I would like to start a Topic about it here on  Reddit. 
But before I invest more time for it, I would like to see some Greeks who act reasonable. 
If you are all Butthurt we can't have a dialoge.

[Here](http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2766676/feldstein_taxable.pdf?sequence=2) is for example a paper by Feldstein that claims that marginal taxes changes the behaviour much more than changes in income tax (based on US taxes)

You seem to be very aggressive. I am trying to have a civilized discussion with you about tax rates, that  I do not agree with you does not mean the above statement that you made, and I do not understand why you did that.

Edit: Jag ser nu att du är svensk. Menar du att devalveringen av kronan inte påverkade svensk ekonomi under 80-talet? Varför är du oförskämd förresten?

&gt;Yes, any time the made up theory doesn't work, blame it on external factors. 

What are you referring to? What made up theory have I presented. I simply asked you to link. Also, you claimed that all countries had good growth because of a high marginal tax rate. I said that wasn't the case in my country Sweden, but you are claiming that it was that.

However, when you look at the periphery before the Euro you'll notice that inflation has historically been pretty high. It's true that inflationary pressures might remain relatively muted until employment started to pick-up, but you can't really expect states that have historically indulged in deficit spending to alter their patterns even more so when pressure lessens. Also, It's important to note the impact of leaving the EMU would have, not simply which type of regime works best.

Regardless, employing QE within a relatively weak economy would most likely result in tremendous depreciation. For countries that rely heavily on imports this would crush the standard of living. It's true that the reduction in real disposable income under internal devaluation has a similar effect, but, when under a free exchange rate regime, imports are affected the most. In the long-run this might probably be good, but I'm skeptical that the likes of Portugal and Greece can compete in a rat race against China. Cheap, low profit, exports really isn't the way to go for developed economies. 

It's obvious that the single currency, as it has been built, has had several negative consequences for the periphery, but unilateral decisions by the bailout countries will, one way or another, result in extreme pain.

I do not advocate QE. I believe it to be a terribly inefficient means at achieving anything. Banks will lend to any credit worthy customers on their doors regardless of their reserve position (federally set interest rates ensure they can acquire any funds they need), and all propping up their reserves does is have them embark on alternative means of investing. Like foreign investment, commodities etc - all things that serve to depreciate the exchange rate, as you say. New jobs serving to replace falling imports, a broken window if I ever saw one.

I really cannot recommend QE. For the $2tn+ the USA's eased they've got little to show for it - to put it into perspective $180bn/yr could employ every unemployed person in the USA at a full minimum wage. Inflation may be a bit higher than under the $2tn of QE, as these dollars would be spent in the economy instead of abroad (it's too low anyway), but the damage to the exchange rate would have been considerably less. And it would have ended unemployment.

&gt; that have historically indulged in deficit spending to alter their patterns even more so when pressure lessens.

Alas the reality of politics keeps us from having nice things yet again.

IMO, a much better argument is that they now have much more incentives to move elsewhere and even from the perspective of the state which wants to increase its revenues, it might end up hurting them because while the tax rates increase, the people making the money either move away, store their money elsewhere, find some sort of loophole to avoid paying anything or simply see their competitiveness severely hit and then start losing business to foreign more business-friendly companies.

So Bill Gates and Steve Jobs didn't make millions, they just piggybacked on the work of others and society?

&gt;taxes are not a punishment they are how we pay for the society.

A 75% tax rate only for certain incomes is clearly a punishment for people who dare have certain incomes.

&gt;And to be honest if they don't want to pay any taxes they can and should piss off to somalia, and see how easy it is to make £10 million a year in a country with no government. 

And now you're saying the alternative to 75% is anarchy. The wealthy will probably indeed  piss off but rather to Switzerland where they'll just pay 8.5%.

I can try to imagine not having to worry about money, but I also don't see it happening for me..

&gt;However I can't believe there could be a difference between earning 3 million a year and earning 8 million a year.

Oh, of course there is.

What if someone from Asia who lives on, I dunno, 500€/year told you he can't imagine someone living on more than 5000€/year and that all incomes over 415€/month should be taxed at 75% to make it fair for him, would you agree?

Do you understand the point I'm trying to make? It's all perspective, just because we'll probably never make more than x money, it wouldn't be fair if someone who earns more than that amount to be taxed much more.

&gt;I mean how could your life possibly be better on 8 million a year than on 3? What would you buy that you already couldn't afford? If you aren't happy with 3 million a year, then more money isn't going to help.

That's up for those who make that amount of money to decide. The same could be said about the previous example, that if you aren't happier with bread and water you'll never be happy and so all your work after a certain threshold should be taxed immensely.

That arguing could also be used against you like ""oh, you're not happy with more than the minimum wage? Uou have a computer, a web connection, a roof you can sleep under and clothes and you're not happy? Society ought to take almost that away from you as the extra money isn't going to help and there are those that need it more"". This is stealing with the justification that the person being robbed is better off than you - that doesn't make it fair.

Dude, I do understand the point you're trying to make, I just don't agree with it.

&gt; **PRESS RELEASE** [*via email*]: **CALL FOR BARONESS SARAH LUDFORD MEP TO STAND DOWN AS HUMAN RIGHTS SPOKESWOMAN**

&gt; Liberal Democrat Friends of Palestine condemn the decision by the Liberal Democrat MEP for London, Baroness Sarah Ludford, to defy party policy and advocate that the EU enter into the Agreement on Conformity and Assessment of Industrial Products with Israel. The agreement applies to pharmaceuticals and is a step towards integrating Israel into the European market.

&gt; Sarah Ludford is the Lib Dem spokeswoman for justice and human rights in the European Parliament. This makes her position utterly unacceptable.

&gt; Forty-six Liberal Democrats, including Lord David Steel, have written to her asking her to resign as party human rights spokeswoman in the European Parliament unless she is prepared to oppose the [ACAA](http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/international-aspects/acaa-neighbouring-countries/index_en.htm).

&gt; John McHugo, chair of Lib Dem Friends of Palestine, says 

&gt; “**It is settled Lib Dem party policy that Israel’s Association Agreement with the EU should be suspended until it ends its blockade of Gaza. To support the ACAA at the present time runs right against this. How can Sarah Ludford have any credibility when she talks about human rights in an Arab country? It is the duty of our spokeswoman on human rights to speak out against injustice and oppression, not to provide comfort to a power that has wilfully established an Apartheid-like system in the territories which it has occupied ever since 1967.**”

true,turnusb,CHIN,China,"In that case, taxes would have to be low enough so that the lower income people could have access to basic needs with what they make after taxes. This means lowering taxes to minimum wage rates, which would shrink the State (not just the government) unproductively, because a State that is too small forces people to spend too much money on healthcare, education, etc. instead of spending it in the real economy. Of course, you can turn those things into 'real economy' by privatizing them, but then people simply won't have access to it because they can't afford it. Quality of life goes abck to the 19th century (or worse).

This is why I think taxes should be established in accordance to how much a person needs to keep a lifestyle that is in accordance to their social class. In other words, if people earn X more than what is established as necessary to live (luxuries included), then that person has a bigger ability to contribute to the State, thus must pay more taxes, than a person who barely earns more than what is necessary to live.

This is an especially progressive policy, not because it gets more taxpayer money to the State, but because it's an incentive for the wealthy to invest in tax deductible markets, which are usually less prone to generating instability, especially finance-sector-wide instability.

For now, in our pre-postscarcity society the best we can do is state socialism in which all infrastructure is nationalized and there is a 100% tax on all profit until we gradually abolish all private property. To see how a genuine future communist society would work like you don't need to look further than Star Trek: 

Even though the show yields to capitalist pressure and tries to portray the Collective like some sort of villain, the Borg seems to be the genuine next big step on the social organization ladder, it's always focused on the common good and there is a distinctive lack of selfish tendencies. It also actively try to export the revolution in true communist fashion but, unfortunately, just like in reality, the other civilizations, being brainwashed by rulers who have only their self-interest in mind, instead of recognizing the obvious superiority of the Borg model and embracing it, act with incredible stupidity and try to resist. The only reason why the Collective didn't crush the Federation is because of the obvious capitalist influences of the show, in a more realistic portrayal the Collective would have been the only civilization in the entire galaxy but I guess the prevalent capitalist narrative wouldn't allow such a thing.

The problem lies in how do you reach there, it pains me to admit that capitalism, albeit vile, is  a metastable emergent system and, thus pretty resilient at withstanding external pressures. So, unfortunately, in order for socialism to overthrow it we need a highly orchestrated revolution to overcome the inherent stability of the system, hence successful socialist revolutions are pretty uncommon. The next major step would be to induce eusociality in an actual New Soviet man, not only by cultural means, but also through genetic engineering so that the individual wouldn't have to ability to survive autonomously, outside of the group. Being completely dependent  on group support for wellbeing will foster the development of altruistic behaviours and  ensure the eradication of the last remnants of individuality. Although this sound implausible right now, it isn't really that farfetched as, in addition to social insects, some mammals are already eusocial, naked mole rats for example. If we manage to achieve that linking all minds in a highly interconnected network doesn't seem that preposterous.  

Provided it's technologically feasible I think the success of this social model is inevitable and it will dominate the world one day. For a historical parallel, look at how early agricultural societies had no trouble in marginalizing the less organized hunter-gatherers.  You can see the same thing in nature, social insects like ants, bees and termites are extremely successful as their total biomass shows.

What's your take on this? I know it's a heterodox approach to communism but do you think it can be done?

true,gocarsno,POLA,Poland,"&gt; I doubt that anyone who earns 10 million a year has really earned it.

Really? I could think of many examples. Take Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google's founders. Don't you think their innovation and ideas have been worth more than 10 million dollars? Think of the value their company has provided to the customers, the employees, and the society as a whole. Of course, they couldn't have done it without the labour of their workers, but it's thanks to Page and Brin the company exists in the first place. With Google current market capitalization of $222 bln, you're saying they don't deserve even 0,0045% of it. Do you think Google owes its success to people who have started it in less than 0,0045%?

So you are wrong even if we vaguely define ""worth"" as what a person deserves according to an arbitrary judgement of social justice. But this definition is useless anyway, see below.

&gt; Labour of thousands of workers who are not paid the true value of their Labour (they would have to be paid less, otherwise the business would not make a profit).

This is completely untrue.

&gt; No person has ever made millions on their own, they have benefited from other peoples work and from society as a whole.

Of course, which is why taxes are paid and employees are compensated for their labour. However, their labour should be valued according to the worth of their contribution. But how do you decide what labour, or anything else for that matter, is worth? 

There are two basic ways to determine this. The first is for someone, typically the government, to decide how much each thing is worth based on an arbitrary set of principles. It has been tried and we have learned the hard way that it doesn't work, to put it mildly. The second way is to have a free market, in which how much something is worth is defined simply by how much people are willing to pay for it by their own free choice. And it turns out what people are willing to pay for other people's labour greatly varies. Virtually all economists agree today this is the system which works best, providing most wealth and well-being.

Let's say I'm a business owner. Why do I pay the CEO 10 times more than a junior employee, as opposed to paying everybody the same, or maybe paying the CEO only 2 times more if that's the number you've somehow calculated to be ""morally right""? It sure isn't because I like they guy, in fact I probably think he's an asshole like most CEOs. I do it because that's the market prize of his labour - the prize collectively decided by individual decisions of all the employers in the market. It turns out it is *worth it* to pay a lot to a CEO, because his labour is making important, difficult decisions and a good CEO can make a big difference. *That's what worth is - the gain you acquire from something.*

Try to find a minority (rich, black, jews, hispanics, gays, immigrants...) and target it. As the rest (majority) is safe, they will find you a great leader. Law of large numbers. Keep the majority happy but somebody has to pay for it. So if you have to hurt someone better hurt the minority. You will lose their votes but you win the majority votes.

true,dageshi,null,null,"I think there's a key fact about the eurozone crisis that you're missing. It's cause isn't government debt, neither is it's cause really the banks in southern europe, the real underlying cause is that the countries in southern europe over the years since the introduction of the euro got less competitive vs Germany and the North.

The Germans can make the same goods cheaper so economics indicate that in a single market the goods will be imported into Portugal, Greece e.t.c. rather than being made locally.

So the solution is, either you make German goods less cheap, less competitive or you make it cheaper and more efficient to make goods in Spain, Greece, Portugal e.t.c.

In the past the easiest and most pain free way to do that would be to devalue your currency, people would still get paid the same but if you devalued by 20% say your exports would become cheaper, your country would become a more efficient place to manufacture goods again. There is a downside of course, it isn't a painless process, because your currency goes down, it costs more to import things. *But* it works, you mix a currency devaluation, slightly higher inflation and a bit of austerity and generally you'll regain competitiveness reasonably quickly.

In the euro you can't devalue, you can't really get much inflation going, so the only thing left is austerity. Which... having been tested for 2+ years now... doesn't work.

So you asked wouldn't a two euro solution stop the northern trade advantage? Yes, it would lesson the Northern advantage, but the Northern Trade Advantage *is the problem*, if you don't make southern europe more competitive vs the North then you never solve the original problem you end up with constant austerity in the south and constant bailouts from North to South in order to stop the whole thing from collapsing.

And as for your final point, the current situation is already a ""haves"" vs ""have nots"". You have southern europe reliant on bailouts inflicting austerity on their populations vs the North which is more or less intact and ok. How could you have any more of a have vs have nots situation?

And the really important thing is, this ""single currency for many countries"" has been tried before. It was called the Gold Standard and it was given up because it was keeping countries in depression.... like now.

Anyway sorry this has been a long post, I've just been trying to explain why from my point of view, the EU is no longer about serving the best interests of its peoples but rather about only considering solutions which make it bigger and more powerful. There are other solutions but nobody has any interest in considering them.

Thank you for taking the time to reply.

&gt; I think there's a key fact about the eurozone crisis that you're missing. It's cause isn't government debt, neither is it's cause really the banks in southern europe, the real underlying cause is that the countries in southern europe over the years since the introduction of the euro got less competitive vs Germany and the North.

I see your point, but for me this is only part of the problem. If you look at the US, from an economic (not political) stand point, you have incredible disparity in wealth and competitiveness when you compare rich and poor states. Yet the system works. Why does it work? I think that its because there are wealth transfers built into the system to balance out the natural capital flight and, more importantly, the economic indicators are set by people thinking about what is best for the whole, and not just the part they live in.

If the whole of Europe suddenly pulled a Germany, we'd end up in a depression because the Euro would rise to the point that we couldn't export anything. 

&gt;In the euro you can't devalue, you can't really get much inflation going, so the only thing left is austerity. Which... having been tested for 2+ years now... doesn't work.

For me there isn't a physical reason you can't do this, it's just lack of political will.

&gt; And as for your final point, the current situation is already a ""haves"" vs ""have nots"". You have southern europe reliant on bailouts inflicting austerity on their populations vs the North which is more or less intact and ok. How could you have any more of a have vs have nots situation?

I agree that the situation is dire, but for me the bailouts are more northern Europe bailing out it's banks than Northern Europe Bailing out Southern Europe. Look at Italy, it has a debt problem, but it's had it for 20 years and has been paying it down like a good country. Spain had a better debt to GDP ratio than Germany before the crises. These aren't countries that are fundamentally broken (yet). The UK would also buckle if it was put under the same investor pressure.",0,1350741295,null,0,false,0,c6p8u5z,t3_11sko7,t1_c6p8u5z,t1_c6p8pyy,null,1430195989,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
