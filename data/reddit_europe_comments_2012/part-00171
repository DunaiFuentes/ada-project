This relates to one of the shoe [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/145hi8/im_an_american_student_studying_abroad_next_year/c7a6da6) Central European clothes/fashion are different from American norms.

They wear pants that fit well, including in-seam length. I usually felt like clothing was expensive or cheap there, but you always got what you paid for.

I'm an American student studying in Germany right now, and when hanging out with other Americans I've literally found myself cringing when the voices start to go up and compete after I became used to the reasonable tones of German voices.

I don't know how Europeans generally feel about it, but I would avoid playing up the whole ""yeah, America is sooo messed up,"" and ""I'm not like normal crazy Americans"" sort of thing. Yeah, it'll definitely come up as appropriate jest sometimes, but I notice a lot of other Americans doing this constantly and there's usually no real point to it other than bringing up how special they think America is again. Most people I meet seem to know that not every American is trying to be a reality tv star, and that they can be normal, nice, intelligent people. I do get asked from time to time if I'm a Mormon right off the bat, however..

I find the things people talk about different than what I'm used to, and I honestly still don't quite understand what's okay and what's overbearing and too personal. Even as a very introverted and quiet person, I still find folks here more closed off than me and very hard to get to know. Just remind yourself that it's probably not unfriendliness, and don't let it scare you away, just give it time. 

As far as clothing, being here over the summer, I found it shocking how conservatively people dressed (especially considering the FKK thing). I felt like a prostitute every time I went outside wearing what I consider to be a normal summer dress in 90 degree weather. 

Also, if you want to fit in with your clothes (assuming it's the same across the border), the biggest thing I can recommend is scarves. Buy as many scarves as you can afford, and wear them all at the same time, at all times. If you don't look like you have a neck-brace under there, you're not doing it right.

As far as the other beer comments go, I find American microbrews *way* better than anything I've found over here and miss them very, very much. The good news is (at least in Germany), it's a million times cheaper over here for consistently good stuff.

The ‘Titlos’ asset was required to be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, and this was assessed by the central bank of another Member State after consultation with the ECB*.

This doesn't mean you won't see it being done in Europe, unfortunately. We wear jeans and T-shirts, too. Really, it's not that different, apart from some things being more popular, and other things a bit less, depending on where you are and of course what the gruesome gods of fashion put on the shelves this year. I live in a large-ish city, it's amazing how people dress and look differently when you get out into the countryside, especially the girls. This doesn't mean you can tell by somebody's clothes whether they live in a large city or a rural area. It's the aggregate that makes the difference, and it's the same between European countries, or the US.   
I used to live in a city that is a popular tourist destination for a couple of years. Yes, often you really can recognize Americans from far away and get confirmation when you're close enough to hear them talk. But it only works semi-reliably with groups (\*cough\*overweightwithshortsandbaseballcaps\*cough\*), and with *some* stereotypical individuals. Btw., the difference between the stereotypical German (or Austrian) tourist and the American pendant is the socks/sandals combination instead of the baseball cap. Tourists are a breed of their own.

There's no need to try and dress up as a European, even if it were possible. I like Discostupid's point in a sibling comment that keeping your American identity is perfectly fine. After all, that's who you are, and everybody will know the moment you open your mouth, anyway. By the time you fly home, you'll have picked up a thing or two that you like and take it home with you. Some of that might be clothes, or maybe you'll have mayo with your fries *as you should*.  
You'll also have learned that the things you're worrying right now really aren't important, and you'll be surprised how much you'll learn about your own home and culture while you're away.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; Maybe all the stereotypical Americans go to Paris and the good ones go to Eastern Europe?

To be entirely honest: this is true. It is very expensive to go to Europe from America, so in general, if you're going to go, most people are going to go see the ""best"" parts of Europe, which are London, Paris, and a number of fine Italian cities. Many Americans may also visit ""the motherland:"" i.e. Ireland, Italy or Germany. Moreover, most Americans old enough to afford a vacation to Europe grew up during the Cold War, when Eastern Europe was hard to visit, oppressive, and frankly, not as nice as Western Europe. It's a lot different nowadays, but old habits die hard. Even younger people who go on vacation to Europe generally hit Prague or Amsterdam instead of Eastern Europe, since those are seen as more fun and cheaper alternatives to Paris or London, but are still safely Westernized and comfortable.

So your hypothesis is probably correct. The people who are likely to go to Eastern Europe are likely either ethnic nationals from Eastern Europe (Polish-Americans are the biggest diaspora from there), or they are relatively well-educated or knowledgeable enough about contemporary Europe to know how nice Eastern Europe has gotten since the end of the Cold War.",0,1354499701,null,0,false,0,c7a9p07,t3_145hi8,t1_c7a9p07,t1_c7a42jl,null,1430561215,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

The British actually led the forces fighting against the Israelis in the Israeli War for Independence, and the only people who gave any kind of help to the Israelis at the start was the Soviets, who convinced the Czechoslovaks to sell the Israelis captured Nazi guns. After a little while, the Soviets realized the Israelis were not going to be a client state, and the help stopped. The rest of Europe did exactly nothing to help the Israelis during their War of Independence and the first years of the state.

Then, after the War for Independence was already won, France was Israel's patron for a while, but eventually they too dropped Israel on its ass to try and make friends with the Arabs after finally letting Algeria go. After that point, pretty much nobody in Europe has done fuck-all for Israel, except for Germany, whose help is in actuality compelled by treaty as recompense for the *millions* of Jews they murdered (with the help of the rest of Europe, with varying degrees of reluctance).

Where's the sympathy? Where's the support? At what point did Israel *ever* have the sympathy, let alone any material support, from ""most of the world?""",0,1354505310,null,0,false,0,c7aaunb,t3_145arw,t1_c7aaunb,t1_c7a8amh,null,1430561756,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

I don't know if thats really the case. In my mind, culture and tradition are everywhere in Germany, so we tend not to value them that much as you might think (or this is just me). Concerning food: A lot of people seem to have rediscovered home cooked meals as a hobby, to eat healthy or regional (or a combination of those reasons). However, Germans eat fast food. A lot. This is not surprising, since we don't have much time together with the family and are on the move a lot, just like all other nations.

Concerning me: I'm a male student (end of master studies in engineering) and live alone. Usually I bring a lunch (a sandwich and some fruit) to save a dime. From time to time I eat out, but I usually avoid most food franchises because I feel like I don't get enough value for my money. My favorite eating-out treat is Döner, because this is something I can't make at home (unlike pizza, bratwurst, [Leberkäse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leberk%C3%A4se)). In the evening I cook from time to time (usually simple meals like pasta with some sauce,  stew or asian stir fry). My grocery shopping is mostly non-organic (because of the price) but often seasonal (bonus, if the food is grown somewhat locally).

Once a week I meet friends to cook dinner, chat and have some wine.

But cooking traditional food takes a long time. The cabbage side dishes need to cook for hours, same for cooked or baked meat like Kassler or Braten. 

Because of this, ""half-ready"" food is huge in Germany. Companies like Knorr or Maggi offer [small packages](http://i.imgur.com/MWhkU.jpg) for sauces, for soups which need to boiled with water or other ingredients. You will get a traditional meal of reasonable quality without having to cook for too long.

There are also a number of brands offering ready food, mostly frozen and for the microwave or the oven. 

Fast food also plays a big role. American-style fast food is dominated by McDonalds and Burger King. But upper and middle class mostly avoid it. It is considered as unhealthy and too American.

In Bavaria, the food culture is similar: They have different meals, but their food is also rather hearty. Bavarian examples would be sausage salad or Weißwürste (white cooked sausages) for breakfast.

We do enjoy a lot of foreign food of course (pizza is loved everywhere).

They don't realize Americans basically live on a cultural Island in comparison and that we don't have much reason to care since we are an economic hegemon and the entire world copy cats almost everything we do. Many Europeans prefer to live inside their own tiny little country. Don't take it personally if they give you crap for being ""ignorant"" in terms of their own culture or languages or geography. Take it in stride. Europeans can be just as ethnocentric as Americans. There's also a huge amount of diversity in Europe, so don't expect everyone to have the same expectations.

I see lot of posts here are really petty in terms of how to act. I think most of these people are overly self-conscious and pretentious judgmental and ignorant and probably just young. And if people wan't to over-generalize about Americans well fuck em. You're enlightened just by virtue of being humble and open minded. If you haven't learned a second language fluently, you'll be amazing how much progress you can make if you study it a couple hours a day.

Can you honestly imagine what would happen if global trade shut down? We're talking about a scenario so disruptive that it's unimaginable.

Yes, the scenario is very disruptive and there are lots of question marks on what the future would bring for Europe in that situation. However that isn't an excuse for a developed society not to prepare for it as best as it can. And preparing for it doesn't necessarily cost lots of money, certainly current subside levels could and should be dropped in the EU, no question about that. However when we do that, we also need to address our food security

It is the same case as building Sahara full of solar power stations to electrify Europe, you could do it, but in the same time you would put yourself into a strategically vulnerable position. Not to mention that starting food production doesn't just happen in turn, it needs years or decades to bring it up to speed.

Another thing to remember is that if Europe doesn't have self-sustainability in food production, that would be a strategic weakness that would need to be addressed.

Look as far as I can judge from Gilmore Girls etc. an American university is a kind of a tightly-knit community with norms, judgementalism and popularity ranking, largely because people are supposed to be extroverted. But the Central European culture esp. Vienna is much more introverted, so people mind their own business and have little communication or relationship with others. Sticking to a small circle of friends. 

So you cannot really fit in because there is nothing to fit in to, because most people won't even notice or care about your existence. They won't judge you, not because they are nice, but because they are really, really indifferent. 

I mean at my workplace in Vienna I am sitting in one room with two guys for 2.5 years and I have no idea if they have kids or any of their hobbies or interests. It is this level of indifference. During 1 month German course on the University Vienna, there was one party organized to which like 20% of the class made a half-hearted appearance, and I went to lunch with some folks once until we realized we bore each other. 

Your biggest problem will be loneliness, not exclusion or judgementalism or lack of acceptance, because there is not even a community there to be excluded from, nor do people care enough to accept or not accept, they just look right past others.

I know it is hard to imagine, to us it is the opposite, when my friend worked a short run in the Silicon Valley he was amazed the amount of chatting, and even people looking like genuinely interested in how was your weekend or faking it really well, which amazed him the most.

I mean for example if we graduate 10K waiters and cooks per year in the gastro high school, but the number of restaurants is actually getting lower, many closing down, how many of them will find a job? 0, so they go work abroad on cruise ships or something.

This is something somehow people do not realize. People do not retire in the poorer countries, not often, because the pension is shit. Or they count to the unemployed because they are fired at 50 so that someone more hungry and driven can be employed. So for every young person there should be a new job created. But in fact the number of jobs is getting lower. All people spend money on is utilities, cheap EU-subsidized imported food and Chinese clothes. This produced few jobs.

I prefer to use the term cultural compatibalism, for instance cultures that share share similar european values, that being rights of individuals, freedom from unjust prosecution, respect of the individuals life decisions ect tend to work well in european nations, for instance how often do you hear of Japanese or general Asian migrants being harrassed in the news or indeed being harassed by the general public (excluding neo nazis who hate everyone), the answer is very very few because their cultures and compatible with ours.

Islam and many middle eastern cultures, even northern african cultures are simply incompatible with our cultural values, it has nothing to do with fear or unjust behaviour, its simple fact people who tend to disagree on a majority of issues don't become friends.

I have no problem with ""multicultralism"" assuming the said cultures are compatible, otherwise you just get the natural result of monoculturalist segregation whereby immigrating populations group together to form their own small exclaves in the nation they ""integrate"" into.

Australia has in my opinion the worlds best immigration policy, that of skilled migration, they have a high immigrant population however all are skilled and culturally compatible with Australian values, it takes work but it does pay off in the end.

The damage has already been done across Europe, unless all 1st, 2nd and even 3rd generation immigrants were screened for cultural compatibalism  and if necessary deported I'm afraid the escalation in polarisation of people will continue, may be extreme, but if we want to live happily together in cultural cohesion it is a necessary evil.

La sentenza della Cassazione conferma la sentenza dell'appello: Sallusti è colpevole NON di omissione di controllo (art. 57 c.p.), ma di concorso (art. 110 c.p.) in diffamazione a mezzo stampa (art. 595 c.p.). Le pene sono stabilite dagli artt. 110 e 595 c.p.:

&gt; Chiunque, fuori dei casi indicati nell'articolo precedente, comunicando con più persone, offende l'altrui reputazione, è punito [c.p. 598] con la reclusione fino a un anno o con la multa fino a euro 1.032.

&gt; Se l'offesa consiste nell'attribuzione di un fatto determinato, la pena è della reclusione fino a due anni, ovvero della multa fino a euro 2.065 

&gt; Se l'offesa è recata col mezzo della stampa o con qualsiasi altro mezzo di pubblicità, ovvero in atto pubblico [c.c. 2699], la pena è della reclusione da sei mesi a tre anni o della multa non inferiore a euro 516.

&gt; Se l'offesa è recata a un Corpo politico, amministrativo o giudiziario, o ad una sua rappresentanza o ad una autorità costituita in collegio, le pene sono aumentate [c.p. 29, 64]

Dato il range di pene possibili, quanto applicarle spetta alla corte, in base a quanto reputa grave il reato (facoltà data dall'art. 133 c.p.)

La ciccia della sentenza la trovi in [http://www.cortedicassazione.it/Documenti/41249_10_12.pdf](http://www.cortedicassazione.it/Documenti/41249_10_12.pdf), dalla pagina 14 in poi, le motivazioni della pena a pagina 23. In particolare, la corte fa riferimento:

- ai precedenti penali di Sallusti, che non è nuovo a campagne diffamatorie;
- allo spessore negativo dell'atto, che ha trattato da delinquenti il giudice (che ha fatto solo il suo dovere), il medico (che ha fatto il suo dovere), e i genitori della bambina (che, nonostante avessero già un figlio disabile, hanno adottao la bambina in questione); e ha inoltre esposto al pubblico i fatti privati di una ragazzina, causando discredito sociale.

Whale is a red meat, looks a lot like beef. Prepare it well and it is juicy and tender. If you don't know how to cook it you can ruin it and it will taste oily and awful.

EDIT. Dimenticavo, la presenza o meno di un test d'accesso varia a seconda dell'università e del corso di laurea, e lo stesso test può essere di diverso tipo: *vincolante*, ed è necessario superarlo per potersi iscrivere al corso di laurea scelto; oppure *non vincolante* (serve solo all'università per valutare la preparazione degli studenti). Credo che il test sia vincolante per biologia molecolare in quasi tutte le università, mentre dovrebbe essere non vincolante (o mancare del tutto!) per scienze sociali. In ogni caso devi fare riferimento al sito dell'università che ti interessa. :)",0,1354569264,null,0,1354569756,0,c7anery,t3_147q2c,t1_c7anery,t3_147q2c,null,1430567805,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

Bedecke deinen Himmel, Zeus,

Mit Wolkendunst!

Und übe, Knaben gleich,

Der Diesteln köpft,

An Eichen dich und Bergeshöhn!

Mußt mir meine Erde

Doch lassen stehn,

Und meine Hütte,

Die du nicht gebaut,

Und meinen Herd,

Um dessen Glut

Du mich beneidest.

Ich kenne nichts Ärmer's

Unter der Sonn' als euch Götter.

Ihr nähret kümmerlich

Von Opfersteuern

Und Gebetshauch

Eure Majestät

Und darbtet, wären

Nicht Kinder und Bettler

Hoffnungsvolle Toren.

Da ich ein Kind war,

Nicht wußt', wo aus, wo ein,


Kehrte mein verirrtes Aug'

Zur Sonne, als wenn drüber wär'

Ein Ohr, zu hören meine Klage,

Ein Herz wie meins,

Sich des Bedrängten zu erbarmen.

Wer half mir wider

Der Titanen Übermut?

Wer rettete vom Tode mich,

Von Sklaverei?

Hast du's nicht alles selbst vollendet,

Heilig glühend Herz?

Und glühtest, jung und gut,

Betrogen, Rettungsdank

Dem Schlafenden dadroben?

Ich dich ehren? Wofür?

Hast du die Schmerzen gelindert

Je des Beladenen?

Hast du die Tränen gestillet

Je des Geängsteten?


Hat nicht mich zum Manne geschmiedet,

Die allmächtige Zeit

Und das ewige Schicksal,

Meine Herren und deine?

Wähntest du etwa,

Ich sollte das Leben hassen,

In Wüsten fliehn,

Weil nicht alle Knabenmorgen-

Blütenträume reiften?

Hier sitz' ich, forme Menschen

Nach meinem Bilde,

Ein Geschlecht, das mir gleich sei,

Zu leiden, weinen,

Genießen und zu freuen sich,

Und dein nicht zu achten,

Wie ich.

Wine is a possibility. German wine isn't known to be amazing, but there are solid wines like Rieslings from various regions like all along the Rhein and the Mosel. Glühwein, a spiced wine is a good alternative as well. It's meant to be heated and consumed warm in the wintertime so it would be a great Christmas appropriate present.

Beer isn't a bad idea, but at least get something decent like König Ludwig if it has to be Hefeweizen and definitely not something like Becks. A nice idea might be to make an Advent Calender (Ger: Adventskalender) yourself with a different bottle of beer for each day. That would give that extra touch and could lead up nicely to the ""real"" present.

Other ideas would be chocolates, the obvious choices being Milka and Ritter Sport. Marzipan falls into roughly the same category. 

Other stuff that might be more exciting but a bit spendy too would be something like a driving experience voucher where he might be able to go drive a Porsche or something similar on a track, if he's a car guy and doesn't get to do something that often. If you're in the SW Region, there's a place called Exotics Racing in Las Vegas that does stuff like this.

Germans didn't have the same experience of WWII and the immediate aftermath as Americans. Entire cities were destroyed, entire generations wiped out or imprisoned by the Soviets, centuries-old German cities and regions ceased to exist, relatives persecuted by the Nazis or sent off to die for them, the shame of being part of a system that enabled the Nazis. There are plenty of reasons why it's patently obvious that WWII is a sensitive topic in Germany, if you would have paid attention once or twice in history class. 

In Germany you *will* get the silent treatment or told off if you keep pulling Nazi jokes. It *is* a sensitive subject and it is *not* funny, especially for Germans who may have had parents/grandparents killed in action for a meaningless war or otherwise victimized by the Nazis.

Don't blame it on Germans for being unfunny. Blame it on yourself for being an insensitive asshole. It's simply not funny, not when an American comes along and tries to rub it in with a ""joke"" to remind you how evil your grandparents were and how badly your country got beaten.

For example in my own home city, Dublin, the Ballymun area was built with the most modern concepts of social housing in mind. They moved some of the poorest people from the centre of the city to the outskirts and failed to provide them with anything that might foster a sense of ownership; services, healthy transport links, etc. Within a decade the area was a nightmare and it's taken many more decades to try sort out the mess. 

It's worth mentioning that Dublin city centre is safer now than it was in the sixties, perhaps because of these schemes, but the cost was sentencing generations to a life with minimal hope.

If the troublemaker owns their apartment, the housing company can still evict them but the owner can then rent it to someone else.

It's the same thing here, and Eastern Europe isn't exactly famous for top-notch police efforts, so if even our guys can keep it under control, it can't be too hard. Call the police, they come and apply the fine. *Repeated* offenses result either in eviction by the owner himself (if the troublemakers don't own the apartment), or in increased fines and even jail time. Hardly any need to ship people to containers. If they're antisocial as a result of being sick, they belong in a hospital. If they aren't, and they're breaking the law, we already have fines, community service and jail, no need to reintroduce deportation...

Research is not paid well (if at all) in Italy and its brightest and best are going abroad (see Ivoronzi's post in this thread), even if they live in the supposed best areas of Italy like Bologna in the north.

Personally, I had dealt with two universities in Italy: Catania and Bologna.

Catania was abysmal. I had applied to Catania directly from the Italian consulate in the U.S. and upon arrival there, they had absolutely no record of my application despite me having my matriculation letter in hand. It took literally two months for it to get resolved. In Italy you get a ""libretto universitario"" wherein they write the results of your examinations--it took them three months to give it to me. They gave it to me the day that I moved to the north. Professors were consistently 30+ minutes late, never respected their own office hours, did not allow class discussion and were almost non-existent. There is a huge problem in Italy of ""baroni""--that is to say, like our tenured professors but ten times worse. They're all academic dinosaurs over 60 who hold no regard for discussion and thought-provoking lessons; they just pick up a check and go and their positions are held usually for life.

In Bologna things weren't much better. The school was completely disorganized. Nobody could tell me what rooms my classes were in and nobody knew when exams were. Try to imagine going to a university in the U.S. only to have your professor say ""I have no idea when finals are."" It's maddening. 

Also, lessons are completely out of a book and most exams are oral ones. You don't even have to go to class, to be frank. Just read your book. How is that learning? Where is the discussion? Where is the professor's chance to refute or agree with what students are saying? It's just memorization.

The worst part was there was no toilet paper in my particular building, ever. We had to bring our own toilet paper. Can you imagine that? I know it sounds silly, but it's really indicative of how little they care about education there (not like we're these paragons of respect for education, but still...). 

My grandmother back in NY got extremely sick and I wanted to go back home, see her and then return for my finals in Italy. I begged and pleaded with my professors to tell me the exam date but all they could say was ""I don't know.""

So I never used my return ticket, said ""fuck it,"" and finished school in the U.S. Believe me, the worst school in the U.S. is paradise compared to Italy.

They are definitely lacking in customer service though-- and that's by French standards. For that reason I would pay a bit more and go with someone like Bouygue or Orange.

&gt;The Burakumin are a group that is socially discriminated against in Japanese society, whose recorded history goes back to the Heian Period in the 11th century. The burakumin are descendants of outcast communities of the pre-modern, especially the feudal era, mainly those with occupations considered tainted with death or ritual impurity, such as butchers, executioners, undertakers, or leather workers. They traditionally lived in their own secluded hamlets.

&gt;Burakumin (部落民?, ""hamlet people""/""village people"") were originally members of outcast communities in the Japanese feudal era, composed of those with occupations considered impure or tainted by death (such as executioners, undertakers, workers in slaughterhouses, butchers or tanners), which have severe social stigmas of kegare (穢れ or ""defilement"") attached to them. Traditionally, the Burakumin lived in their own hamlets or ghettos. As a social minority the Burakumin have been discriminated against.

I recommend to watch if you can find it.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130752/

&gt;I saw the film a long time ago, after my interest in gypsy culture, music and history had been aroused by Kusturica's ""Time of the gypsies"". This film is, in comparison, practically unknown. However it manages to contextualize certain themes in the lives of Balkan gypsies. Set in a refugee camp run by the UN during the Balkan war, it is the story of a rom patriarch who is a good for nothing drunkard, with one vocation... he constantly dreams of returning 'home' to India (from where all gypsies are fabled to have started their cross-continental odyssey), to escape, once and for all, the persecution of gypsies by the local population. He befriends the UN area commander, an Indian, with the hope that the friendship would serve as a passport for him and his family to India. In the process, he even tolerates his daughter's dalliance with the UN commander, since he has been promised help with emigration by the guy. Ultimately, it ends in heartbreak, as the UN commander and his batallion of Indian troops are suddenly relocated, and he leaves without even a goodbye, leaving the daughter pregnant in the process. It is a poignant tale, but what was most interesting for me was the depiction of the hankering of the gypsies for Indian culture, in the form of Bollywood movies (there is a scene where the entire colony attends a open air screening of ""Bobby"" on VHS projected on a white sheet.
&gt;
&gt;Even as I recognised the scene as a depiction of the projection of an unreachable hope, the kind of stuff that keeps u going... I thought ... if only they knew how much more intolerant Indian society was towards their marginalised! This is a flawed yet wonderful little film and should not be missed by anyone with any interest in gypsy life and culture, if not for anything, simply because it depicts the other side of the coin... the side which mythmakers Gatlif and Kusturica fail to address!",0,1354632767,null,0,false,0,c7b1gia,t3_1495kx,t1_c7b1gia,t3_1495kx,null,1430574558,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

The ""fetes de Bayonne"" are a traditional Basque celebrations where tons of people go on the streets dressed in white with a red scarf and do cultural activities such as bull runs, floats, fire works etc. Bayonne is in the Basque region of France near Spain so these traditions can appear more ""Spanish"" (they are Basques though) than ""French"".

true,naughty,null,null,"That a country could pull backwards implies there's an ultimate 'forwards' that everyone is aiming for. There isn't such a shared vision of the future though.

Look at the current issues about the Fiscal Union and Banking Union, Germany wants one before the other and France the other way round. A few countries don't want to be part of the Euro. Once the details of Federalisation get discussed there will be even more friction. How many citizens are willing to pay extra taxes that purely go into a shared Eurozone budget for example? When the reality of how strict the EFC is hits, how is that going to pan out?

You could see this as a problem to be brushed aside by (qualified) majority opinion or some powerful EU level government but you have to accept that it will create resentment and probably force some countries out of the EU (which I would count as a great failure if it happened). Or just accept it as the price of doing things consensually.

One of the greatest triumphs of the EU that it isn't based on force or coercion. Yes it is messy, yes it is slow and probably not 'optimal' in some way. It is however the most just and fair way to proceed.

There's also nothing stopping subsets of countries from integrating more while others stay as they are. If there really was a benefit to integration those opting out would only hurt themselves and eventually join in the end.",0,1354637502,null,0,false,0,c7b2jjp,t3_149995,t1_c7b2jjp,t1_c7b27a7,null,1430575174,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4
