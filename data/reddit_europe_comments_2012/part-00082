true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I can't help but think of the Scottish independence movement when I read this. There, Cameron argued that the uncertainty needed to end, but that it would have to be an ""in or out"" vote, not one about a renegotiation of the terms.

So far, the UK has managed to either preserve the status quo or to negotiate an exception. Administrative challenges aside, exceptions increasingly smell of ""more equal than others"" in a union of 27, and soon 28. Now it looks as if a large step towards integration will happen, it's only a question of how far and whether or not it will be for the EU as a whole or if there will be a Europe of two speeds, something the UK has historically been very opposed to but that even Cameron himself recently said was necessary.

Even if the Tories hadn't explicitly promised a referendum about any further steps towards integration, Cameron can't ignore public opinion and that of a large share of his own party for much longer. He doesn't have a mandate that would permit him to go further, and he can't block the process because, for the Eurozone, this has become a question of economic survival and the political cost of losing the UK pales in comparison.  
This puts him in a bad negotiating position. He must be careful not to raise too high expectations about those new terms in a referendum if it happens, because even though the UK could block changes to the EU or even of individual new policy decisions, there is no way to change the existing contracts without the others not only all agreeing to his demands, but also being willing to go through a new ratification process just because Cameron is such a nice guy, with all the domestic political problems this would cause in the other member states with their own Euroskeptics coming up with their own list of demands. The EU can't give the UK preferred treatment or it would risk a string of similar pick-and-choose negotiations with one country after another, beginning with the Czechs. It would be much easier to just say ""no"" and leave Cameron to deal with what is then a domestic policy problem for him.

The problem with an ""in or out"" vote obviously would be that, the way thinks are looking now, an ""out"" seems like a very real possibility. Business leaders would tear him a new one if he'd risk that, and hop from talk show to talk show to explain the difference between free trade and a single market. This would even put the City at risk; while I'm sure that they're relieved about the upcoming banking union in the Eurozone, they can't be happy about the financial markets there integrating with them on the outside. A British exit from the EU would be even worse.

Of course there are alternatives to a membership that would still ensure full market access, the remaining members of the UK's old free trade area that they co-founded demonstrates that. But having to accept regulations and directives without being represented in the negotiations can't possibly be what the people have in mind when they claim that the UK should have more independence from Brussels.  
The other alternative would be to try and come up with a new construct within the ""Anglosphere"" and hope that the Americans will treat the UK as an equal partner, or go with a Commonwealth based solution because India's billion citizens can't wait to give their old colonial lords a say over their rapidly growing economy. Or maybe the UK could go it alone and hope that China will meet them with a lot of understanding when they complain about what Chinese protectionist measures mean for British businesses.

So, he's in a difficult situation with no possible good outcome, but not much of a choice about how to go about it, either. I almost feel sorry for him, but as far as European heads of governments in difficult situations go, he's far from the worst off, theses days.

None of this has happened yet in the PIIGS countries nor in France or the rest of them.  
The only places where *true* austerity has taken place is the Baltic countries.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I'm not arguing against having a lingua franca, I'm very glad there is one. Just pointing out what the author was referring to in his title, I hope it was obvious enough that I don't think your science career will be doomed if you don't speak Mandarin. It could become useful over the coming years, but automatic translations are getting better and better all the time and I just don't believe a transition like the one the author talks about will happen any time soon.

&gt; I also don't really agree with the complacency argument. I think language learning is a pragmatic act. Put someone in a circumstance where it is immediately useful to learn a language, and they will in general do so.

Learning an extra foreign language when you need it is a pragmatic act, but this doesn't mean learning your first one wouldn't have a value in itself, whether you will eventually move to a country where it's spoken or not.  
First of all, it shows you that you can do it. I'd find the prospect of having to learn a new language scary as hell if a career opportunity in another country would open up and I hadn't done it before. I probably wouldn't even think about going. I've spent half a year in Australia, which was an extremely valuable experience that I wouldn't have considered doing if it had meant spending many months learning a new language first to be able to take part in normal everyday life there. I went there *because* I already spoke the language. Had I learned Spanish instead of English, I probably would have gone to South America instead, and I'm sure it would have been just as valuable an experience. Where you go hardly matters, what counts is that you've experienced what it's like to live elsewhere.  
So, learning a foreign language (any, really) gives you the opportunity to break out of your own language bubble and peek into that of another. It makes you question what you consider normal, you learn just as much about your home than you learn about the place you're visiting. Of course you can travel to most places without knowing anything about the language there, but it's like looking into a house through a window instead of actually walking around inside.  
It's also a base to built upon -- my French is really quite bad, but I'm confident I'd pick it up soon enough if I lived there for a while, and it would even make learning Spanish or Italian a lot easier than it would be otherwise.  

Of course you could learn the language you'll need for a specific purpose when you need it, but sometimes it's knowing the language that opens the opportunity or makes you look into moving or travelling there, not the other way round. No, Polish wouldn't get you very far in Germany (although, there's a lot of trade between Germany and Poland, so some companies might see it as a plus), but if your company was planning to built up a subsidiary in Poland, and you already spoke the language, this would make you a more attractive candidate for that assignment than you would be otherwise.

Now, if you only speak one language, you're better off with English than with any other. Neither me nor the author claim that it's a *general* disadvantage for Anglophone countries that English is the lingua franca, this would be silly. What s/he's saying is that it does come with disadvantages as well, and that people are missing out on opportunities, for their careers or just for personal advancement.",0,1341125968,null,0,false,0,c57y0tm,t3_vv466,t1_c57y0tm,t1_c57wtij,null,1429270784,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Carnelov,null,null,"Hollande fait comme Sarkozy : il va se prendre une veste à l'échelle internationale, puis pourra dénoncer l'Union Européenne/l'Allemagne/n'importe quel autre pays étranger. En sachant parfaitement (ils ne sont pas entourés de tarés, ces gens-là, et comprennent les implications de leurs demandes) qu'ils émettent une demande impossible à satisfaire en l'état des choses, ils ne font qu'enfoncer la France, en plus.

En résumé et en très vulgarisé :
La mutualisation de la dette (eurobonds) ou même la garantie de la dette de certains pays (ex : la Grèce... ou n'importe quel pays européen) par d'autres pays (ex : l'Allemagne...) implique une convergence des taux d'intérêts.

Imaginons que vous garantissiez les dettes d'un ami à la solvabilité douteuse. Par solidarité. On considèrera que ses dettes sont devenus vos dettes. Tout comme lorsque Papa-Maman se portent garants de votre loyer : en cas de défaut de votre part, ils sont là pour assurer.
Dans ces cas ""civils"", terre-à-terre, vous pouvez demander à savoir comment votre ami va s'en sortir, payer ses dettes (il n'arrête pas, le bougre !), ou régler sa situation. Tout comme Papa-Maman vont peut-être vous demander de vous calmer en termes de budget les périodes où vous serez réellement dans la merde financièrement, et incapable de payer votre loyer si cela se trouve. Ce n'est pas très agréable, mais c'est légitime : on peut très bien refuser une aide, il faut alors se démerder autrement.
Dans ce dernier cas, il faut imaginer que votre ami peut très bien déposer un dossier de surendettement, cumuler finalement ces trois boulots qu'il rechignait à faire... ou dans le cas d'une location garantie, que vous vous démerdiez autrement (avec location d'un studio/appart plus petit) en attendant d'avoir assez de fric.

L'Allemagne est parfaitement légitime à demander une avancée dans les deux sens : une mutualisation des dettes MAIS en échange, une Europe plus fédérale, une perte de contrôle des Etats-Nations face aux puissances transnationales, européennes. Personnellement, je suis contre mais on ne peut que comprendre sa position. On lui demande (et aux autres pays européens) le beurre, l'argent du beurre et les fesses de la crémière.
L'Allemagne, bien entendu, perdrait également de sa souveraineté. Elle aussi devrait se faire contrôler ou (si c'est le cas) alimenter un budget d'Europe fédérale. La différence, c'est que dans une telle situation, un pays plus faible économiquement aura sûrement moins à dire, puisqu'il sera plus contrôlé.
A noter que l'UE reste jusqu'à présent pas mal respectueuse des peuples à représenter, et même les petits pays le sont. Dans une Europe Fédérale, il ne s'agirait pas d'être petit ou grand, mais également d'avoir une économie qui roule, un budget équilibré et des institutions économiques performantes...

Lorsque les gens ne comprennent pas vers quoi où l'on va, il faut se dire qu'il s'agit du même processus de création qu'un Etat ordinaire. La centralisation des pouvoirs monétaires (BCE) et budgétaires (nous sommes à un tournant) sont des étapes obligatoires. Il y a quelques siècles (pas si longtemps), la France était un véritable bordel en termes de pouvoirs locaux. Ce qui fait que la France est désormais la France, c'est avant tout la multitude de grands travaux politiques, économiques et institutionnels qui ont permis l'unification de notre Etat-Nation. 
De nos jours, si une commune fait défaut (je pense à Angoulême... hahaha), elle se retrouve sous tutelle. L'Etat central est là pour tout reprendre en main lorsque les collectivités locales (disposant de leurs propres compétences et pouvoirs) sont mal gérées. A noter qu'un département, par exemple, n'a pas le droit de voter un budget en déficit. Et il me semble qu'il ne peut s'endetter UNIQUEMENT que pour des dépenses d'investissement.

Une autre solution serait ""à l'Islandaise"". Mais cela correspond à une forme de plan de rigueur appliqué par les nationaux eux-mêmes plutôt que demandé par des étrangers. Démocratiquement, ça change tout. Pragmatiquement, ça revient quasiment au même. Les Grecs peuvent très bien envoyer paître leurs créanciers et revenir à la drachme s'ils le veulent. Cela implique uniquement que le reste du monde sera profondément réticent à lui prêter la moindre somme avant un moment, une hausse exceptionnelle des prix, une nécessaire refonte totale de leur économie (qui devrait redevenir très, très, très productive...

true,Doctordeseo,null,null,"There are tickets for watching the bulls and the runners arrive to the plaza, they are very cheap (5 euros) in the weekend and i think they might be free during the weekdays (at least some of them). There is always plenty so you shouldnt have any trouble getting one. 

Fun fact, people that run the encierro and arrive very (like really) early to the plaza are trashed a bit (in a funny way not in an agressive way) by the people in the plaza because they are not brave, and because if you run the encierro you are allowed to stay inside the plaza for free while they had to pay a little bit of money.
This is important because right after the arrive of the encierro, there is music in the plaza and a funny/friendly event with small cows (vaquillas) that charge into drunk people that dare to jump into the arena (i think anybody can jump inside), or in a not so funny scenario are ""recortadas"" (something like baited i guess) by amateurs bull fighters (they are not bull fighters at all but i dont know how to call them in english). It can be lots of fun and i highly recomend it. I dont think it last too long though.

About the safest areas to watch, all the areas with the wooden fence (and of course the plaza) are really safe to watch. I think this are the only places where non runners can watch the encierro so you shouldnt worry at all. Usually people stand up over the first or the second wooden plank (you pretty much have to, if you want to see anything) and if the bull goes very close to the border of the track can be a little scary because they are huge, but if you dont do anything stupid and you are ready to step aside if a runner needs to leave the track very fast, i dont think there is risk at all in watching.

In my opinion, unless you really want her to see you running the encierro (and you are not running the last part of it) watching the arrive at the plaza is a very good idea because it is not expensive, you dont have to be several hours waiting and because you will be both able to watch the little show after the run (that it isn't anything really special but can be fun).

Other Germans also do not have the right to change the vital parts of the Grundgesetz (constitution), which was based on the experiences of the WW2 and is legally unchangeable.

The circumcision judgement was based on one of the unchangeable articles, article 2, ""everybody has the right to live and the right to bodily integrity"". The judge explicitely stated that Article 2 trumps article 4 ""freedom of religion and worldview"".

German jurists and legal academics have been warning for *years* that religious surgeries are likely illegal under german Grundgesetz, but nobody ever sued, so everything just opearated in a legal grey area.

This actually was the first circumcision lawsuit ever,  and the judge made the verdict everybody already was expecting him to make. It wasnt a surprise in legal circles, it was only a shock/surprise in political circles, because the verdict now makes a important part of Judaism illegal in Germany and how are they going to explain that to Israel?

And it wont suffice to take the children outside of Germany for circumcison and then come back, this will be illegal too, like female cutting and child abuse in other countries already is. You cannot just take your child to the fucktardistan you came from, rape and mutilate it there, and come back pretending nothing happened just because it happened somewhere else.

Unless there is a new lawsuit, and the new lawsuit reaches the german constitutional court, and the constitutional court somehow argues that Article 4 trumps Article 2, which is according to several legal opinions *very unlikely*, male genital ritual surgery in Germany is dead in the water.

For the legal opinions, see for example:

I'm currently doing my masters degree at Uni Freiburg (computer science, did my bachelors degree here too). 

The CS faculty itself is located a bit outside of town so I recommend you to get a bike since you can reach almost any place in town in &lt; 20 min. Public transportations are fire too, there are two bus lines and a s-bahn connected to the campus -- you even get a discount as a student for a ticket, it's about 75 Euros per semester I think.

The food in the cafeteria (the ""Mensa"") is really, really awful. I haven't eaten there since a long time.

The campus of the faculty of applied sciences itself is not that big and resembles more or less a big sausage fest.

Not all lectures are in english. Some professors switch between english and german every year, but at least there are always recordings in english from the past years.

The courses in general aren't that big, they reach from about 10 to 20 people in average which is imo pleasant because you work closer together with the professors and they are almost always willing to help you if you have problems. Some courses require you to do exercise sheets during the semester (every 1-2 weeks) in order to be able to write the exams at the end of the semester (most of them are _during_ the semester vacations). Some exams are oral, some written.

Freiburg is a small but beautiful town. The temperatures are in average quite high compared with other germany cities. Nightlife is probably quite boring in comparison with Hamburg (although WG-Partys can be fun).

Feel free to ask me any further questions!

Germany is an exporting Nation, making tons of Money producing goods and selling them. A strong German currency would therefore mean they get less money for selling their goods, thus becoming less competitive. A sole German currency is therefore a haven for investments by the Finance industry, which then unfortunately results in an overvaluation of the German currency.

Britain on the other hand, is an importing nation. British industry has crumbled to bits due to bad choices their government has made in the past, thus relying in the service industry and financial industry to keep their economy going. Here in Britain, as they import goods, a strong British Pound is good, as they would have to pay much less for the imported goods and is also a good place for investors to put their money into a strong GBP.

But I have a question to you. Why is it that Britain(or probably only England) does not wish to be part of a stronger Europe?

2) Ireland and Portugal have implemented their austerity measures to the letter and show signs that they're about to return to growth

3) Greece hasn't implemented some of the most important austerity measures they are crying about yet and projections for them returning to growth don't look so good right now (we can speculate that the greek government over the last 1 year or so has been sleeping and not actually doing much..). I think you'll find that eventually when someone goes through all the books for real, a lot of these corrupt politicians cut a lot of funding used for the people and funnelled it into their personal retirement accounts, then blamed it on austerity. Lets just hope that Greece actually starts prosecuting a lot of these corrupt politicians instead of just mentioning it casually and then not doing anything about it. The greek people deserve justice.

4) Cyprus hasn't gotten a deal yet, the troika will arrive there tomorrow to check the books. Depending on what they find, a deal will be made. The only thing that will be considered a loss to Cyprus is if they make them increase their corporate tax rate (unlikely if the books look like they're in good order).. Reforms have already been made in Cyprus, but they can definitely cut a bit deeper into the public sector, which is currently ruled by greedy unions.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Yeah, that's one argument. The other is that Milošević violated Kosovan rights, demoted its autonomy (rendering it more difficult to become ""legally"" independent) and that a group of people has the right to self determination.

Are you serious? :) Albanian students started rioting in the 80s because Albanians were not given advantages in the Kosovo society (Serbs held most of the executive positions). Riots got squashed by force. People in Serbia (Belgrade) started rioting in 1991 because of the War, and Milosevic got the tanks out on the street. You had it FINE in the ex Yugoslavia when you had a SHITTON of benefits, and our parents (and grandparents) had to give a way a % of their salary so the Albanians in Kosovo can equalize economically.  
When shit got tough, you decided to secede.  All of the sudden, you see that as the only solution to the situation instead of siding with the people of THE COUNTRY YOU ARE RESIDENTS OF.   
This is the thank you that the YUGOSLAV people get after all those years of taking care of you. And don't give me the atrocities bull shit. It is YOU who poked a beehive with a stick. Forming an ILLEGAL (terrorist) guerrilla who would ATTACK AND KILL members of the POLICE AND ARMY. What the fuck did you expect was going to happen?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;UNSC resolution 1244. Which makes a unilateral secession illegal in the eyes of international law...

not according to the International Court of Justice, which concluded that the resolution was not violated, since it doesn't define the end status of Kosovo nor reserve its determination to the Security Council, only specifies the interim structure to facilitate negotiations, and doesn't prejudge what its final state will be:

&gt;Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) was essentially
designed to create an interim régime for Kosovo, with a view to channelling the long-term political
&gt;process to establish its final status. The resolution did not contain any provision dealing with the
&gt;final status of Kosovo or with the conditions for its achievement.
&gt;
&gt;In this regard the Court notes that contemporaneous practice of the Security Council shows
&gt;that in situations where the Security Council has decided to establish restrictive conditions for the
&gt;permanent status of a territory, those conditions are specified in the relevant resolution.
&gt;
&gt;By contrast, under the terms of resolution 1244 (1999) the Security Council did not reserve
&gt;for itself the final determination of the situation in Kosovo and remained silent on the conditions
&gt;for the final status of Kosovo.
&gt;
&gt;**Resolution 1244 (1999) thus does not preclude the issuance of the declaration of
&gt;independence of 17 February 2008** because the two instruments operate on a different level: unlike
&gt;resolution 1244 (1999), the declaration of independence is an attempt to determine finally the status
&gt;of Kosovo.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Secondly, turning to the question of the addressees of Security Council
resolution 1244 (1999), as described above, it sets out a general framework for the “deployment in
&gt;Kosovo, under United Nations auspices, of international civil and security presences” (para. 5). It
&gt;is mostly concerned with creating obligations and authorizations for United Nations Member States
&gt;as well as for organs of the United Nations such as the Secretary-General and his Special
&gt;Representative (see notably paras. 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11 of Security Council
&gt;resolution 1244 (1999)). **There is no indication, in the text of Security Council
&gt;resolution 1244 (1999), that the Security Council intended to impose, beyond that, a specific
&gt;obligation to act or a prohibition from acting, addressed to such other actors.**
&gt;The Court recalls in this regard that it has not been uncommon for the Security Council to
&gt;make demands on actors other than United Nations Member States and intergovernmental
&gt;organizations. More specifically, a number of Security Council resolutions adopted on the subject
&gt;of Kosovo prior to Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) contained demands addressed
&gt;eo nomine to the Kosovo Albanian leadership.

&gt;The machine is measuring the breath. It is measuring the alcohol in the vapor of the alveolar air in the deep lungs that you expel. But the machine is telling you how much alcohol is in the blood — not in the breath. So it uses what we call a partition ratio. To put it simplistically, the machine has an old, very primitive computer inside it. There are different machines, but the computers in them will all report, ""Well, if you’ve got this result from the breath, there must be 2100 times as much in the blood!’ Using a multiplier inside the little computer, that’s what it prints out.

&gt;But the computer is assuming that your partition ratio is 2100. Problem? Very few people have a partition ratio of 2100-to-1. It ranges anywhere from about 1100-to-1 up to 3500-to-1 and higher. And there is no way of knowing at the time of testing what your partition ratio was because medical studies have shown that the partition ratio changes within an individual all the time. One person is going to be very different than the person sitting next to him. *Your partition ratio tomorrow is going to be different than what it is right now.*

Currently is not strange to find teachers in both public or private schools that are teaching in Spanish, although they should do it in Catalan, normally there is no problem in that. The same happens if an student asks a question in Spanish in class, is completely normal.

What will happen when the segregation starts? Easy, it will be like in Valencia: 

* First, immigrants will go to Spanish public schools, instead of Catalan public schools, both immigrants for other parts of Spain or latinamerican.
* Then, this schools will be ghettos and rich parents will send their kids to private Spanish schools.
* Use of Spanish in Catalan schools will be forbidden in class. And the same in Spanish schools. Currently there is no problem in that, but after the segregation it will be.
* Kids will have a wrong message, in both sides, thinking that their language is better and then also their ideals and way of life. In 20 years we will have a huge problem. A problem that currently does not exists.

The other alternative is to switch all education to Spanish, and then this will be the end of the Catalan as a spoken language.

I've studied a few years in the UK along with other Greek students. We've made friends (some of them close) and talked to many British young men and women while there. One thing that surprised us was the way you Brits view your country. In anybody else's mind, there are the superpowers (USA, China, perhaps the USSR in the past) on one end, the smaller countries on the other (Greece, Portugal, Denmark, Austria, the Scandinavians, etc.) and the well-off middle-sized 'normal' countries in the middle (France, Spain, Italy, the UK, and of course Germany leading the pack which was obvious even back in the '90s).

To our surprise, we discovered that the Brits put their country on the top shelf, along with USA and China. A very good English friend had once asked me 'So, which one do you think has the biggest influence on world events, the US or the UK?'. His question was in earnest. In my mind, this is the real reason for your attitude towards Europe. You don't have the tendency of smaller countries towards safety through unity, the sense of 'belonging'. You're not a superpower, maybe not even an industrial powerhouse like Germany. Yet, you used to run an Empire. I believe that you still carry that attitude, even subconsciously.

Historians agree that Stalin's plans were to watch the big capitalist powers weaken themselves through war before moving against them.  It was only after Germany invaded, that Stalin allied with the western powers.  Those powers then sent supplies that helped support the USSR's armies while industries were transferred to the east.  After America entered the war, the Allied bombing and Mediterranean campaign tied down 1.2 million Germans that could have won the war in Russia for Hitler.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I can't see mandarin becoming the number 1 language for a number of reasons (I didn't read the article but a few in the comment thread have brought this up). 

1. English is the de facto world language. 2.2 billion people speak english as a first or second language although I cannot say how fluent those people are, that's a heck of a lot of people. Most of the world use the latin alphabet (or related alphabets) so english is a lot easier to learn than say, chinese, which uses a completely different alphabet.

2. English is spread more diffusely across the world. If you go to china people will speak english. If you go to brazil, people will speak english. The same cannot be said about Mandarin.

3. A linguist told me that people who live in the countryside in China have a very different interpretation of what Mandarin is, and can sometimes be as different as different languages in europe.

4. China may be the most populous country now but because of the one child policy we can expect to see a dramatic drop in its population. By 2030 (I think) China's population will begin to decline and I imagine it will rest eventually as policies change. English speaking countries (Canada, Australia, the UK and the US) expect increasing populations, and I think the US could actually reach 500 million people by 2050 (if memory serves me correctly).

5. The anglicisation of european languages cannot be ignored either. Loan words are common throughout other european languages, not to mention the increasing use of english at university level (post grad at the moment, although I have heard tales of undergrad programs in just english). I would not be surprised if in a generation or 2 english became the de facto EU language similar to how english is the world language. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if something like the irish language shift happened in some of the more english fluent countries. Many of my English as a second language friends say they find themselves accidentally using english instead of their native language. This is called code switching, it's very interesting actually. 

6. The code switching thing is very interesting, I was watching an Indian talk show a day or two ago and the host welcomed in english. He then introduced his guest in english an then suddenly, mid sentence, switched to hindi. It was only then I realised that hindi was the primary language and the host had been speaking english to supplement his hindi. The increase of english in India is probably the main reason why english is likely to remain the primary world language.

7. It is impossible though, to compare the current situation to any in the past. Latin died out because latin was born in a time when mass media did not exist. Why is english in the US and english in the UK so similar? Because of globalization. Sure, people could start speaking a weird dialect of english which we couldn't understand, but they would not understand the media or be able to partake in society. 

8. If you're interested, Singapore is quite a cool example of language shift. Roughly 35% speak mandarin and 32% speak english. You might expect a gradual shift to chinese as china grows in power and the fact that it is so close to china, but the opposite is actually happening. There is a gradual shift to english as a first language and in the last 20 years the number of people speaking english at home has increased by effectively 14%, from 18% to 32%. Mandarin, on the other hand, has stayed stable in the last 10 years at about 35%. I always think Singapore is sort of an example battle ground of which language would prevail if both were put head to head.

When I read for instance the New York Times or Foreign Policy about the EU, I feel they don't get European politics are much slower than American. This is of course not good, but negotiations and politics here are not pointless and going nowhere like those papers suggest, they just move slowly forwards

By the way, what has been bothering me a lot is that everyone, from papers to politician, American and European, talk about how the EU does stuff to the European countries and vice versa. What those people forget and what our prime minister likes to forget when something not popular happens, is that the European countries are the EU. The EU is not an alien entity dictating European nations, it is a gathering of European nations, deciding together.

The EU 'government' is made up of 3 entities:

- The European Commission, headed by EU President Van Rompey, which is the executive body. It consists of 27 commissioners, each with their own branch of the day-to-day running of the EU. To place it in a known context for redditors, Neelie Kroes, the commissioner who said ACTA would surely not pass, is one of these 27.

- The European Parliament is the chosen representation of the European people. It is the legislative power. At the moment there are no European parties, people vote for a party in their country, which then gets a part of that countries seats (look here for more on this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament#Members)
The Parliament can vote on legislation since the Lisbon treaty. The Parliament is against ACTA, Thursday a week ago the International Trade commission votes against it as 5th and most important of the parliamentarian commissions, meaning that most likely there is a majority in the EP against ACTA.

- European Council: This is the council of the heads of state or government of the 27 member states. It was the European Council that did this summit and that's why you read about Monti, he's as head of government of Italy a member of this council. As it has turned out, it is this council and not the EP which has the biggest influence in the EU. They often decide on policy and treaties and lately to solutions of debt crises. 
Since the Lisbon treaty, there's a 28th person attending Council meetings, this is Catherine Ashton, high representative for foreign affairs, a new EU position to have a more unified representation on Foreign Policy. As we saw with Libya, with Ashton talking restraint moments before Sarkozy launched his jets, this does need some work.

While the European Parliament is supposed to represent European interests and all European citizens, the European Council represents national interest and governments.

Those who know their Montesqieu know I did not name a judiciary power. This is the Court of Justice of the European Union, located in Luxembourg. For European citizens, this is the highest judiciary power. You can appeal and appeal until you end up here, but this is the end station. To get a practical example of one of its uses, we can go back to ACTA. The European Council, in favour of ACTA, is submitting ACTA to the European Court of Justice to see if it is a sound law. This way they hope to get more time until ACTA has disappeared from the public opinion and they can sway the EP more easily.

Keep this in mind, know how the EU works with every piece you read about what they decided on this time and suddenly the blame game and what happens makes a lot more sense.",0,1341166348,null,0,false,0,c5835vb,t3_vvjqz,t1_c5835vb,t1_c580onu,null,1429273212,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hey!

I've been living on my own since I moved here so I'm not that familiar with the dorms of the Studentenwerk. I have no information on prices but here are a few impressions:

- Studentensiedlung (aka ""StuSie"", see http://goo.gl/maps/WW5s): Located a bit outside of Freiburg to the west. It's quite a big complex housing about 1000 to 1500 students in 15 to 20 houses. You can reach downtown within 15 minutes by _Straßenbahn_ (tram) or bike. The _Technische Fakultät_ (see http://goo.gl/maps/yZAb) where you'll have most (if not all) of your lectures is not that far away either (maybe 15mins by foot) although there is no direct connection via tram or bus. Overall it's a really nice place to live, especially in spring and summer because of the small lake located right beside it. I often grill there with friends. Afaik most of the appartments are _Wohngemeinschaften_ with about 4 to 8 people per floor that share a bathroom and a kitchen. Personally, I haven't seen many of these appartments from the inside but from those few I have seen I can say they are quite nice. Also, there is a bar called StuSie-Bar right on the campus. I believe every room has access to internet but you'll probably have to pay for it by yourself.

- Stühlinger (see http://goo.gl/maps/s4jp): I've only been there a few times but it seemed to be quite a pleasant place to live. I think it used to be a military hospital and it's located quite central in town. They have a bar in a cellar where you can get relatively cheap drinks and play pool billiard. The dorm sizes probably reach from 4 to 8 persons. I don't think there is a direct connection to the faculty via pubic transportation.

- Vaubaun (see http://goo.gl/maps/r0re): Located on the other side of town, so it's quite far away from the Technische Fakultät and downtown. Vauban is a disrict of Freiburg known for being eco-friendly so there is a lot of green. Kind of a chilled place, connected to the city by tram. I knew someone who lived there in an appartment with one other roommate sharing bathroom and kitchen.


All of these places are not bad at all. There are a few more but I don't have much information on them. If you are not into living in a _Wohngemeinschaft_ with 4+ people you could try to find something which is rented in private although I'm sure you could ask the management to find something smaller. Private Wohngemeinschaften are usually quite popular and usually require you to show up before and present yourself because they wan't to get to know you. Living on your own is usually more expensive. In your case it's probalby the best to apply for an accomodation of the Studentenwerk at first and then change if you're not happy with it. Also during the start of the winter semester it can be quite hard to find something else.

I haven't had any lab sessions since the second semester of my bachelors. Most of the time you get to work on an excercise sheet which is handed in and discussed during class once a week. For example: http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/ss12/robotics/. As you can see the solving of these sheets aren't mandatory to be admitted to the final exam in this case but in sometimes you have to reach at least a certain amount of points to write the exam, for example: http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~ki/teaching/ws1112/aip/exercises.html (at least 50% of the points). It really depends on the professors. Some courses focus on working on practical sheets where you usually have to implement a given task, some others require you to work on questions ""on paper"" to consolidate the theoretical background of the contents from the lecture. Getting to know some people to work with on these tasks is quite helpful!

I'm not that much into clubbing either! There are a few nice bars and places to hang out all over the city that are usually crowded with other students since the city has a relatively high ratio of students from the uni.

Sadly I can't help you with your cell phone issue since I don't own an iPhone myself, just some shitty old Nokia. Well, at least it does it's job.

true,StoneCall,SACH,Leipzig,"Es gab zu dem Thema keine Pressemitteilung der Bundespartei oder der Bundestagsfraktion, sondern nur diese inoffizielle Aussage von vier Abgeordneten (Plattform CSD Liberal):

&gt; Dem vorliegenden Gesetzentwurf mangelt es an Sorgfalt. In letzter Minute – nicht etwa wie üblich im Rechtsausschuss, sondern im Plenum - legt Bündnis
90/Die Grünen einen Änderungsantrag vor, mit dem ein gravierender Fehler korrigiert werden soll. Nach dem bisherigen Wortlaut bezog sich die Inkrafttreten-Regelung nicht auf die Verkündung des Gesetzes, sondern auf
den 1. Januar 2012, der bereits abgelaufen ist. Nach dem Wortlaut des Gesetzentwurfes hätten ab diesem Stichtag keine eingetragenen Lebenspartnerschaften mehr geschlossen werden dürfen. Seit dem 1. Januar
2012 geschlossene eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaften wären wohl unwirksam gewesen.

&gt; Der zentrale Mangel des Gesetzentwurfes besteht darin, dass keine ausreichende verfassungsrechtliche Prüfung vorgenommen wurde, ob eine einzelgesetzliche Regelung ausreicht oder ob angesichts der Rechtsprechung
des Bundesverfassungsgerichtes eine Änderung des Grundgesetzes erforderlich wäre. Wegen dieses Mangels hat auch der rechtspolitische Sprecher von Bündnis 90/Die Grünen, Jerzy Montag, im Rechtsausschuss nicht für den vorliegenden Gesetzentwurf gestimmt.

Das erste Argument bezieht sich wohl darauf, dass es beim Inkrafttreten ""2012"" und nicht ""2013"" heißt - das liegt daran, dass der Entwurf fast ein Jahr in der Schublade lag. So etwas passiert gelegentlich auch bei beschlossenen Gesetzen, das wird dann rasch einstimmig korrigiert und erledigt ist die Sache. 

Insofern ist es sicher ein Ärgernis, aber einfach korrigierbar und kein Hindernis, insbesondere da der Änderungsantrag sofort hätte beschlossen werden können.

Den zweiten Punkt halte ich für eine ebensolche Ausrede, aber da lasse ich den [Gesetzentwurf](http://dip.bundestag.de/btd/17/063/1706343.pdf) für sich selber sprechen, dort wird das Thema erschöpfend abgehandelt (was in der obigen Aussage natürlich nicht erwähnt wird). Außerdem: wie oben erwähnt lag der Entwurf ein Jahr in der Schublade - das heißt, wäre die FDP wirklich dahinter, wäre es sicher kein Problem gewesen, innerhalb eines Jahres ein Gutachten einzuholen.

Übrigens: Jerzy Montag hat, auch wenn man die Aussage so verstehen könnte, zwar tatsächlich nicht für den Entwurf gestimmt, aber auch nicht dagegen, er hat sich der Stimme enthalten. Über seine Motivation konnte ich nichts finden.

Und zur Gruppe ""CSD Liberal"" - dieselbe Gruppe (bzw. ein Mitarbeiter) sagt auf ihrer Facebook-Seite auch:

&gt; In der Sache natürlich dafür... Aber auf der anderen Seite ist die FDP bei der Abstimmung an den Koalitionsvertrag gebunden -keine wechselnden Mehrheiten. 

Insofern kann man zumindest bei den Abgeordneten von ""CSD Liberal"" davon ausgehen, dass aus rein koalitionstaktischen Gründen nicht für den Gesetzentwurf gestimmt wurde.",0,1341178124,null,0,1341178421,0,c585lyl,t3_vsodo,t1_c585lyl,t1_c5858ka,null,1429274369,2,false,de,t5_22i0,2

Try to avoid the Ramblas and Passeig de Gracia, they're high-density tourist places that charge you as much as double extra for anything. There are also some nice bars at the Maremagnum in Moll d'Espanya (just past the Ramblas in the port), it depends mostly on what kind of place you were expecting

also some info:

If you order a bottle of beer you'll normally get a ""quinto"" (20cl) or a ""mediana"" (33cl) which are around 2/5 and 3/5 of a pint respectively. 

If you order barrel beer, you can get a ""tubo"" (a tall glass, 33cl = 3/5 pint) or a ""jarra"" (a mug/jug/tankard), which can vary from 20cl to 50cl, 2/5 to 1 pint; sometimes even 1l, 2 pints (although the most common is 50cl)

there are also cheap and readily available one litre bottles (litronas) in most supermarkets and grocery stores. Of course beer cans are too.

- If there was any ""bullying"", it was via Spain and Italy's refusal to back the growth pact; nothing to do with GDP.

- The proposal to allow the ECB to lend directly to banks rather than via governments is a sensible idea that solves the real and persistent problem of weak banks dragging down weak sovereigns which then in turn drag down weak banks.

- I think that this deal will be good for all the financially troubled nations. Certainly here in Ireland, the media (who generally love to sell doom and gloom, especially regarding European issues) are all reporting very positively on the development, and the yields on our bonds have plummeted. This is because of indications that Ireland would also get a better deal on its repayments, and in particular that the assumption by a past government of a massive amount of private debt might be reviewed.

Honestly I am really happy with the outcome of this summit and I think we might finally be getting somewhere. If these market rallies continue, the peripheral nations will be able to return to the bond markets sooner and this will demonstrate to the creditor nations that giving debt-burdened nations some breathing space can actually work in the interests of the creditor nations.

So in other words, you don't know anything at all about the country, and you've never visited, but  you want to plan your life around moving here?  Ooookay.  Go to university and study for a career doing something that other people will pay you lots of money to do *and* that is internationally mobile.  Don't get some ridiculous bachelors degree in 18th Century American Literature if you want to move to another country.  Engineering or computer science would be the best.  Graduate and work for a few years.  While you're working, visit Germany.  Don't just visit Berlin, visit *Germany*.  Also visit other countries, so you can compare them.

Germany is far from perfect, and it is definitely *not* whatever it is you're imagining it to be (""the weather""?  What the fuck?).  It is a conservative and sometimes racist country, wages are stagnant (and employers are pushing more and more for wage-dumping laws like the recent Blue Card), there are massive demographic problems that are coming up in the next few decades that no one knows how to fix, the EU and the Euro may not be around in 2020, and our eastern states are locked in a perpetual cycle of not having enough jobs to keep people living there, and not enough people to attract employers.  The weather is not that great, being in central Europe and all, and the government is full of incompetent fools.

My point, in short, is that you won't get anything approaching a full picture just by reading things or worse, talking to a teenage girl.  You may spend a week in Germany and discover you hate it here (many foreigners do, particularly Americans), but the next week find that the Côte d’Azur is perfect for you.

Hostel One Paralelo (20 euros a night) is excellent and its close to Montjuic and La Rambla, closer to the coast.

Hostel One Barcelona (20 euros a night) is also excellent, huge rooms, colder(makes a huge difference) than most hostels. Great staff, good showers, lots of computers with internet access and wifi. Close to La Sagrada Familia, Arch De Triomphe, with easy routes to the beaches.

· Large computing store (PC City): Security guard would leave his post at the entrance of the store to follow me around (This happened regularly to me in the same store).

· Small bars/cafes: Typically you order some breakfast/coffee/whatever, eat up and pay at the end. I'll often get asked to pay up as soon as I've given my order (or even as I'm giving my order i'll get interrupted and ask to pay up). The further I move out of Madrid, the more this happens (I like to travel a lot)

· Ladies with purses: When travelling in the metro, if there is a large crowd (inside the train or going up/down stairs) often old ladies will stare at you and tightly clench their purse and move it furthest away from you. This stare of death really freaks me out :P

The current system, as it is in Sweden at least, is that if you have a TV or a computer capable of accessing the Internet or TV signals you have to pay a television license fee (which is *not* a tax!), since you will then have access to the public television channels run by the state. The idea behind this is that you shouldn't have to pay for the public television channel unless you are capable of watching it (which is contradictory to how the government funds pretty much everything else.)

However, at the point that you say that a computer with an Internet connection is sufficient to qualify you of having access to public television and thus be forced to pay the license you might as well drop the whole licensing system and increase the general income tax by like half a percent or whatever to pay for the public television channel instead, since at that point you are practically covering the whole population anyway.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Krugman exists in a world where there's apparently no such thing as democracy.  He is trying to paint this crisis as something that ""European leaders"" can just fix by snapping their fingers, as if national constitutions and the voters who put these leaders into power in the first place don't exist.  Any failure to fix this crisis immediately is hence a failure of national leadership.

Yes, it's very likely true that, economically, just turning on the printing presses at the ECB could fix all of Europe's woes, or setting up a transfer union between rich northern states and their poorer southern cousins could solve all the problems.  But this ignores the elephant in the room in that these measures are incredibly unpopular in e.g. Germany, are likely unconstitutional as-is, and not just because German leaders have been hammering the line about lazy southerners for the past two years.  There really is a problem in the south with graft, tax evasion, size of public sectors, competitiveness and early retirement, contrary to what Krugman is trying to imply.  Why would the average German agree to a transfer union under these conditions?  They won't, and this is why there's no simple solution to what is essentially a political, not solely economic, problem.

Krugman is also wrong to hammer austerity measures because various European country's economies have not yet caught up to where they were pre-crisis.  As we've no doubt gathered, pre-crisis growth was a mirage built on unsustainable spending that's now no longer feasible.  Austerity isn't meant to promote growth in the short term.  It's a measure needed to get uncompetitive economies back on track to where they can grow (real growth) in the future.  In this light, Krugman's claim that austerity doesn't have any success stories is absurd.  Germany and Sweden are both success stories in this vein.

This is, however, far from forbidding/not teaching a regional language, because of course they should be taught (and this should also include other regional languages that nowadays are basically forgotten by the media/politics).

I studied in Catalonia when I was a kid (in a small but known village in Gerona) and I remember we had quite a few Catalan lessons per week, and the rest of our lessons were in Spanish, with some Catalan here and there that would just come up naturally. Now my niece, who is South American but has lived in Catalonia for 10 years, studies at a public school and her lessons are 100% in Catalan and still has issues following them - also, she mentioned that sometimes she feels she's not able to explain things in Spanish to the new kids (Spanish speakers, wherever they might come from) that don't understand Catalan yet. She always has to speak in Catalan to her teachers and they are forced to set all their computers in Catalan and scolded if they switch the language. I met a guy from Barcelona not so long ago and he told me once that in his high school (I don't know if this happens often), teachers would ask students if they wanted the lesson in Spanish or Catalan; so if the majority wants them in Catalan you know what happens to the rest of kids... Segregation is already happening.

Anyways, I always found funny how the small part of the population that actually speaks only Catalan (mostly old people from villages) will try their best to explain themselves and to understand people while younger generations that know how to speak Spanish perfectly can act like little unpolite pricks (and this also goes for local politicians that sometimes are not even from Catalonia, ha). Luckily this doesn't happen often, but apparently the trend has been rising lately.

What reform? Before the crisis, Spain had low government debt (way smaller than Germany) and had positive current account balance.

They did not lose competitiveness against Germany. They were never competitive against Germany under same currency and never will. The reason why the managed was that they had separate currencies. If German imports grew too much, value of Deutche Mark increased relative to other currencies and things balanced themselves. Even in the case of Italy, Italy was steadily reducing it's national debt to GDP ration before the crisis. Italy had huge debt load but it was coming down.

Get good grades in school, with the idea of going to a good college program in a career that can open doors. Technical degrees are desired in most countries. You can't go wrong with that.

Meanwhile, keep studying the language and learning about the culture. Work on your free time, and save money. Plan a summer backpacking trip vacation to Germany (and even places nearby). Come, party, explore, hike, learn. This will give you at least a superficial idea of how things are here, but also it will be really fun. Also, ask if there are exchange programs between your school and others in Germany. Another alternative is that, once in college, go on an student exchange program, and take classes in Germany. 

This way, you will learn more about the country, with the idea that if you really like it, your degree can help you find a job here.

I never said I wanted to tax computers. That's an argument you've been talking about all along, yet it's not something I've proscribed or advocated at any point.

In fact, my argument has been that it's absurd to take out a fee (once again: **fees are not taxes!**) for having ownership of a television or a computer with an Internet connection rather than just paying for the whole thing via conventional taxation methods, if indeed the government should be running their own television channels and radio stations in the first place. (In which I don't have an opinion and could go either way to be to honest.)

Like I said: I don't see why public TV and radio is any fucking different from any other public services the government provides. I mean, we don't tax people for being sick and in need of national healthcare. We tax *everyone*, regardless of whether they are sick or not, to pay for our national healthcare. The same principles goes for just about everything the government does. You aren't taxed for being on the border in times of war when the military comes to defend you, no, everyone regardless of whether they strictly speaking are in immediate need of military protection or not has to pay taxes to support the military. Social services, same thing. Doesn't matter if you are poor and you need that social security cheque to live and not starve, or whether you are rich and will never ever in your lifetime have any need whatsoever of social services: you still have to fucking pay your fucking taxes that are used to fund these things.

Why should public media be any different? It's a public service like any other!

&gt; The government does not have to burden the citizens with intrusive taxes. The very same USA is able to sponsor government-run TV and Radio without taxing TVs and computers.

Uhm... no, it's not? The US ""public"" media like NPR are in fact private initiatives funded by donations from like-minded individuals. The state is not involved at all. The state control of media in the USA extends as far as running the FCC to censor things that are considered to be too vulgar for the general public, but beyond that there's no state involvement in television or media at all in the USA.

Anyways, as previously mentioned, I'm undecided if I even care if the government wants to spend money on running public TV and radio or not. It's relatively speaking such a small expenditure in comparison to what the state has to spend on other things that for the individual tax payer it wouldn't amount to basically anything, regardless of your economic status, if it were to be a part of the general income tax. Licensing fees on an individual basis for a national public service however is just blatantly absurd and strange and as previously mentioned simply does not make any sense when the rest of our public services are funded by taxes which each individual has to pay regardless of whether they make use of the service or not.

PARIS — Where’s Germany’s Plan B?

Opinion: Where’s Charlemagne When We Need Him? (July 1, 2012)

For Op-Ed, follow @nytopinion and to hear from the editorial page editor, Andrew Rosenthal, follow @andyrNYT.
The question came up during the second half of the European soccer cup semifinal match last week between Italy and Germany at a moment when the Germans were losing 2-0 and looking thwarted — but not changing tactics.

Bixente Lizarazu, a former French international player and star at Bayern Munich, and now a television analyst here, joined his broadcast colleagues in explaining as Italy headed to victory: “There is no German Plan B.”

These days, that answer also fits the German economy and the country’s banks and finances.

Without a scoreboard’s precision or a referee’s play-stopping whistle, the evidence says that Germany is moving in the direction of a recession, faces palpable international concern about its public debt and the solidity of its banks, and, no longer infallible or triumphant (but rather like a senior partner in shared misery), must develop a more flexible approach in leading Europe.

You’d think Germany could well consider changing its game under these circumstances.

In recent months, an important indicator of financial experts’ expectations for the German economy shot downward, a huge decline described as the deepest since 1998. Siemens, Salzgitter AG, the steel maker, and Infineon Technologies, a manufacturer of computer chips, all issued profit warnings.

In the banking sector, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank were downgraded in June by Moody’s with remarks that their debt and deposit ratings were notches higher than their standalone capital assessments — meaning that the banks were less resilient than noted because the rating agency assumed the government would prop them up if the sector’s “limited loss absorption capacity” faced challenges.

The Kiel Institute for World Economy, which has a government advisory role, hardly sought to offer general reassurance, commenting, “Risks of a recession have distinctly increased.”

To boot: Bill Gross, who runs Pimco, the world’s biggest bond investment fund, said in mid-June that the European debt situation means “Germany for me is a credit risk. It’s not an attractive market.” (He added after a European summit on Friday that Europe’s “debt trap” remains in place.)

So where’s Plan B?

It’s nowhere if Angela Merkel doesn’t acknowledge there are big problems at hand and changes needed in the German approach. That’s exactly what she does not want to do before national elections in autumn 2013 because the chancellor has told her electorate non-stop since 2008 that Germany’s economic creed is a beacon to the world.

Clearly, Ms. Merkel has invested heavily in making Germans believe she’s made them immune to external grief. She tells the world Germany can’t help more, while assuring the folks at home they have no responsibility to pick up after their neighbors.

Slyly, Robert Zoellick, the departing chief of the World Bank, characterized her as having “a tremendous sense for what the German people want.”

The result for Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform, a pro-European think-tank in London, looks like this: “Germany is much more vulnerable than German policymakers appear to believe. Germany’s strength is exaggerated and its weaknesses downplayed.”

There are Germans who agree.

Nine months ago, the Mannheim-based Center for European Economic Research, after much German talk of the onset of a “golden German decade,” began to pick up signs of a significant German slump at the same time as Ms. Merkel was saying “We’re the locomotive again.”

Wolfgang Franz, chairman of the chancellor’s independent economic advisory board, replied, “There are no more locomotives.” He told me then there was nothing new in the economy to indicate a long sweep of economic growth since Germany had “basically spent its structural reforms of 2005.”

This year, the O.E.C.D. is projecting German growth will not exceed 1.5 percent through 2019, and will fall under 1 percent from 2020 if no significant reforms are introduced.

That’s stagnation, and hard for voters to overlook.

Yet in this new context, there are circumstances that can move Ms. Merkel toward a measure of softening of her all-austerity doctrine.

One is the notion that whatever happens in southern Europe, Germany and its credit rating will be stuck with massive, largely uncollectible receivables in troubled euro zone countries — an amount currently estimated by Egan-Jones Ratings at about €700 billion.

The second, more political factor is that in 2013, Merkel will be running against a Social Democratic Party that no longer has to pull its punches as it did in the 2009 election after four years in her Grand Coalition.

Nowadays, the Social Democrats say the Merkel austerity approach has failed, leaving “stability and confidence in Europe further away than ever.” Estimations of diminished German job growth bolster the argument.

And since last week’s European Union summit in Brussels, there’s the precedent of Italy and Spain muscling Merkel into concessions about their debt. The usually supportive Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote that in the process the chancellor made herself open to future “blackmail” by spend-thrifts.

No embrace by Merkel of a real Plan B is to be found here — but this signal to those partners who see the chancellor’s Germany as vulnerable, outnumbered in the E.U., and wrong: Keep on pushing.",0,1341235114,null,0,false,0,c58ehwc,t3_vw3n7,t1_c58ehwc,t1_c58b279,null,1429278628,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

Thanks. This is a near-perfect recap of the problem. To complete it, one also has to add the question of European **solidarity** in times of crisis, and this is, I think, still an open question: is the current level of transfers and fiscal guarantees enough, given the fact that it is not *only* domestic economic interests that motivate the political actors and voters, but also the more altruistic idea of a united, equal Europe. But from Krugman's perspective, there is simply *no* accounting for domestic interests and the quite understandable reluctance to enter an all in fiscal union with drastically different (and, to be honest, less competitive) economies. His only appeal to the domestic interests of the creditors is that ""austerity doesn't work"" and will come to bite them in the ass in the end... well, it kind of does work: they don't pay as much as they would otherwise, which they probably consider quite a success.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Yeah, it's not a surprise in principle, but I don't understand why they only do it now, after a compromise has been found, and not during the negotiations. I know the final agreement wasn't entirely clear whether or not this would include purchases on the secondary market, but if they have strong enough opinions about this issue to threaten a veto, why not clarify this right way?  

Anyway, the Netherlands and Finland haven't exactly been in the closet, but they managed to remain in the background. I don't blame them -- there will be enough to negotiate in regards to further integration, where their positions might not always align with Germany's, so it seems only natural to preserve political capital to spend it later.

The problem I have with this is that, if we fail to solve this crisis, the narrative for how it happened and who is to blame is set. Finland went as far as demanding collateral for the second (IIRC) Greek bailout, but you hardly ever hear about that. Imagine if Germany had done that.

In a way it's natural that the focus is on Germany, through size alone. But when people read stuff like ""Germany, Europe's paymaster"", they know that the other countries pay as well -- their own taxes go into this pool, after all. With the meme that the bailout was just a ploy to bail out German banks (initially the French ones were included), this is already different. I don't think even many Irish or Portuguese know that, relative to their GDP, their banks were about three times as exposed, or that Dutch or Austrian banks were about as exposed as German ones by this measure, not to mention those in Greece itself. This narrative will stick.

But that Merkel must be pulling the strings in the background when, for once, a bit of the spotlight touches on some of the other countries that have some very similar views, is a conspiracy theory that goes a bit too far.",0,1341235704,null,0,false,0,c58ekwk,t3_vx4vy,t1_c58ekwk,t1_c58e7yn,null,1429278665,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

You fail to recognise that Germany will pay either via i) inflation, ii) fiscal transfers or iii) the break up of the eurozone. Just saying, oh it's unpopular, is putting the carriage before the horses when it comes to what they'll do. Even the opposition in Germany is in favour of growth measures. Merkel just stated Germany's place is in Europe.

It was a banking crisis in Spain ( Ireland, etc), not government overspending, that then lead to a fiscal crisis. [They still have too large a construction sector in Spain but Ireland is looking better.](http://www.voxeu.org/article/whats-wrong-spain). But sure the size of public sector, pensions, competitiveness is something most countries in Europe are grappling with. I'm sure as a British Person, with your bank runs and QE, it's some consolation when your savings are depreciating that you can at least avoid thinking about it due to the ambitious eurozone show on the otherside of the channel.

Using Germany and Sweden as success stories in this vein is misguided.

Germany has kept down wages at same time as people in Germany and the rest of Europe funnelled their money into Spain giving rise to a boom there, inflating wages and demand for capital goods. There was an article by Martin Wolf on what Spain could've done and did to mitigate this and you'll be hard pressed to find any faults in it. A lot of people wanted holiday homes in Spain, haha. Private money flowed in, then it flowed out. But now they're stuck with too high wages in their economy (making their exports uncompetitive in comparison with Germany etc.), a problem Germany faced earlier but managed to adjust to in the growing economy of the previous 10 years, using a monetary policy that seemingly exported inflation to the periphery.

Sweden inflates and devalues, like under the financial crisis, to be competitive. (People I know invested in a swedish export mutual fund to take advantage of this 2008ish.) They also use deficit spending to ease the pressure further on private cutbacks and their debt down paying. If there's both private and fiscal cutting back you'll get debt deflation. Just look at Spain etc.

This is why Krugman argues for monetary stimulus ( inflation) to help with the adjustment.

I tried to make the point that Germany is firmly committed to the project. That even though one could imagine the opposition to be anti-eu like in some countries (Finland and Netherlands?) it's of a quite different variety in Germany.

So you'd just tax anything that seems to be growing in an economy? Don't you subscribe to there being a strong populism? ""Listen to the people! Oh, wait.. tax that!"" This is what I find a bit hard to believe. Sure with tax policy you can create bubbles by creating unsustainable demand. But is it really so obvious beforehand? But yeah, in hindsight, the shit banking in the periphery is quite mind boggling. But it was foreign money flowing in, how could they'd know it would all vanish in a global financial crisis and leave the country with massive losses on asset prices?

I wonder how much of a bubble the Spain real-estate really was, if this capital flight and risk aversion would subside then asset prices in Spain might rebound. So in a scenario where they fix the Euro problems, a lot of the losses on the collateralised loans (?) may be recouped. The climate there isn't going anywhere.

The fact that Krugman is ""from a country"" that doesn't manage to deal with it's own debt is in fact irrelevant, true. But I assume Haaveilla's remark was refering to the fact that *someone from a country that can't deal with it's own debt AND who is in a position of power in that country* cannot be taken entirely serious. 

More specifically, the argument essentially says: ""US politicians that fail at keeping their own debt under control should not give advice to others how to control their debt"". Similarly, Krugman (an influential economist and media personality) advocates a, broadly speaking, ""grow your way out of debt"" strategy, and one can argue that this is what the US has been trying in the past and it hasn't worked.

Merkel says eurobond won't happen as long as she's alive.

&gt;The most important event last week was probably not the agreement at the summit anyway, but the statement by Ms Merkel that there will be no eurozone bonds “for as long as I live”. My belief is that this statement reveals she is not serious about political union, to which she has been paying lip-service over the past few weeks. Her tactics remind me of the “coronation theory” of the 1980s: the Bundesbank used to say that monetary union was acceptable but only after full political union was completed. It was another way of saying never. I always suspected all this talk about long-term solutions might be a ruse. Now, it seems, we know.

The place used to be a sleepy, charming medieval town, with a lake and lots of lovely little villages around it.  They massively dropped cantonal income taxes, leading to a _huge_ influx of businesses and high income earners - this led on the one hand to a great demand for office space, fast, now now now, and on the other, to the need for a great many new mid-priced (for Swiss standards, lol) apartments and houses to put up all the ""middle class"" and lower income earners working for these companies or otherwise attracted by the growth. 

[Here's a good example](http://www.hwp.ch/images/objekte/efh/2005_1911_rotkreuz/1911_rotkreuz_lb1.jpg) from a nearby town.

All over the country you get these ""agglomerations"", horrible personality-free suburbs mixing evil bland 1960s and 1970s square living block architecture with new shit.  It's all perfectly rational and tidy and clean but has zero soul.  The few places with any architectural merit, like you see for example around Zurich, tend to be fairly standardized concrete-and-glass structures - [these are pretty typical](http://www.swiss-architects.com/en/ksa-architekten/de/) - that sell for astronomical prices.  There just isn't enough interesting architecture to go around.  

Even the legacies from the 1920s and 1930s are often colloquially known as ""living barracks"" - these are often collections of apartments built for blue collar people (Switzerland was quite poor before WWII) with low-ish ceilings, small kitchens, and narrow corridors connecting comparatively tiny rooms without much light - they'd be best served by knocking out most of the walls, but nobody ever bothers.  

My father has a large house in the countryside dating from 1971, and even that is pretty hideous - it has a lot of floor space, but is utterly hideous to look at and lets in very very little light.  Its only redeeming feature is that they've planted so much greenery around it that it hides most of the building itself - and this is my childhood home.  You can imagine how I feel about such places that I don't have any emotional attachment to :D

Because despite the celebrations and the accusations, depending on if one is a Southerner or a Northerner, there has been no compromise yet.

In the same period, [Spain and Italy have to find about €71,7bn and €146,8bn](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/vwz8g/one_more_summit_the_crisis_rolls_on/c58d553) respectively.

I'm not saying that they (Finland and Netherlands) did or didn't hold out, but it wouldn't seem impossible to do so. Germany could save face in the summit by agreeing in principle, then some other states could harden their stance and give some room for negotiation to the so-called German-led core, when the German government tried to sell the final deal domestically.

Again, this has been observed with other states in the past, it's not only about Germany. There is a lot of background that is absent from the media reports.

It's not Wolfgang's Euros, collected by Germany's tax authority, packaged by ladies in dirndls, and delivered with assorted Kinder chocolates to reckless suntanned revelers that play darts with Goebbel's face, but Euros that Wolfgang might be liable for in the future, if the Southerners don't pay them back. While this is not happening, Wolfgang makes some beer money; hundreds of millions of Euros until now. Wolfgang's gesture is appreciated, but he should know how it really works. It's not a gift, but a loan.

&gt; the meme that the bailout was just a ploy to bail out German banks (initially the French ones were included)

While the extent of Germany's pre-crisis [toxic exposure](http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2012/0629/1224318947013.html) is not revealed yet, you are right, it was not about German and French banks that were exposed because they didn't care for their customers. It was about most European banks that did the same. Of course, the failed economic policies of many states were instrumental in creating this huge black hole. But while they are being told to adjust their constitutions and laws accordingly, in order to ""get it right"", Germany's domestic issues and its grip on the ECB opened the gates of Hell: it was not about ""isolated cases"" any more. Add the failed remedies to the mix, and you have the roadmap that led us to this point. Now, even Germany puts itself in danger. Germany's [irrational fears](http://blogs.channel4.com/faisal-islam-on-economics/the-1tr-mark-note-symbol-of-germanys-fears/15536) make it impossible to accept proposals that would ease the burden on the German taxpayer.",0,1341242786,null,0,1341245156,0,c58fv2s,t3_vx4vy,t1_c58fv2s,t1_c58ekwk,null,1429279266,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

That is completely wrong. Krugman points out that you need growth to reduce debt to GDP ratio. Neither US or EU can save itself out of debt. Krugman's position is economics 101, its not even particularly Keynesian point of view.

Macro- and microeconomics work differently. In microeconomics (open system) company or person can realize that they have accumulated too much debt and start paying it back. Each amount they pay their debt, reduces their debt. Individual decisions don''t have much effect to their environment. 

Macroeconomics works more like closed system. If someone saves money, someone else sells less stuff and pays less taxes.  If there is depression like now (overcapacity and  no demand), and government decides to save to make up decreased taxes, this reduces demand even more, reducing tax income. What's more important is that in US there is less safety nets. Prolonged depressions cause permanent damage to people and their future earning capacity (reducing the size of future economy and size of taxes that can be collected). This leads to reduced ability to pay back debt. Krugman knows that there is debt problem, but he also knows that in able to pay off debt, you can't do it reducing investments. 

In both US and EU, politicians use microeconomic arguments for macroeconomics. They look sensible for voters but they are disastrous for them. ",0,1341243704,null,0,1341244645,0,c58g298,t3_vx3b7,t1_c58g298,t1_c58fqni,null,1429279359,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Un altro episodio che mi viene in mente solo ora è quando una zingara maledetta mi ha chiesto in prestito cinquemila lire per leggermi il futuro (avevo tra gli 8 ed i 10 anni). Dopo avermi pronosticato amore e felicità voleva tenersi le cinquemila ""se no non si avvera"". Io invece me le ripresi e lei mi lanciò la maledizione foreve alone.

Fino a quando non diedi il primo bacio alla veneranda età di 18 anni la mia anima accusava la megera del vergognoso record. Questo, forse più che la sventura ciclistica, è il germe del mio odio verso il popolo rom.

Terza cosa, che a quanto pare questi ricordi arrivano in cascata con gli altri, alle elementari una ragazzina rom ha frequentato la mia classe per qualche mese. Mi sembra fosse una specie di eletta della famiglia visto che aveva altri over9000 fratelli e sorelle sconosciuti alla pubblica istruzione. Non faceva mai i compiti, non aveva mai nemmeno una penna e parlava sgrammaticato, ma nessuna delle maestre le rompevano i coglioni come avrebbero invece fatto con noi comuni studenti italici. 

Però questa cosa ai tempi non mi infastidiva, e non l'avevo nemmeno notata troppo.

Ecco, se c'è una cosa che mi fa incazzare è che tanto alla fine a loro nessuno dice niente ""perché sono fatti così"". Ma vaffanculo, nessuno è fatto così. Nessuno nasce stronzo e ladruncolo. Ci si diventa. E questa cosa secondo me parte dall' abbandono minorile, che a quanto pare non è reato nei campi rom.

Under the criteria that we would normally judge a government at a national level. With the fiscal compact, if there is a crisis in a random country, the European authorities expect them to cut the money they give to their population, but we also expect that within each country people will be looked after.

Well, I wasn't trying to be a smart ass, I just meant what I said, literally: unless given good reaons to the contrary, we should assume that an established national constitution shouldn't just be changed on a whim. Making the passing of EU laws easier, or more ""streamlined"", is certainly not a good reason for me. In fact, I would call it deeply undemocratic if the legislative body of my country would give away its own power to reject EU treaties and laws.

I already said it above, but I'm actually quite EU friendly, and in the long run, I don't even mind if the German constitution is superseded by a European one, i.e. if the nations of Europe enter a full political federation.

I'm German. I don't always trust, or perhaps more correctly: I don't always have full confidence that my fellow citizens act *rational*, in the best interest of their community, and not entirely out of pure self-interest. Neither do I have this trust in all of German politicians. But that said, by and large, I *do* trust German institutions. I *do* believe we have a just constitution, and that it is, by and large, obeyed by a majority of citizens. I don't necessarily have so much *individual* trust in my countrymen, but I do have enough trust that the community of Germans is working well enough together to constitute a functioning state.

Good. No problem so far, eh? But now I look further. I have, roughly, the same feeling of trust in the Netherlands (sometimes more so). Same for France -- they tend to vote a bit too much towards the extremes for my taste, but altogether, I recognize my own values and principles in them. Same for England, Austria, Switzerland (if only they were in the EU...), Luxembourgh, and (based on what little I know about them) the Scandinavian countries. I'm probably forgetting some countries, but you get the idea, the European ""North"".

And there I feel I need to stop with extending that trust. Now, you can be all angry at me and call me a racist or a cultural chauvinist, but from what I've learned through first-hand experience, from discussions with friends and from media depictions (and, no, I'm not talking about Bild coverage), I don't feel comfortable extending the same trust to, say as an example, Southern Italy or most of Greece. 

**For god's sake, please note the following:** This lack of trust is not based on some belief that the people in the South of Europe are inherently less trustworthy or inferior. I make no individual distinction between a German, a Frenchman and a Spaniard. The lack of trust is simply because I don't have the same trust in their **institutions**, in the abstract sense of the word, roughly meaning: the permanent (or very slowly changing) ""structures"" that underly and define a society.

How to change that? How to get the same trust in all EU countries? I personally hope that, after we've put the current crisis behind us, the EU will get back on its path in trying to make the institutional landscape of Europe more homogenic. But until then, to answer JB_UK's question, I *do* in fact have more reservations towards some parts of the EU to behave decently with funds than I do with others.  

* * *  
  
**EDIT:** Since my post is getting quite a number of upvotes and a lot of responses, I want to make one thing really clear:

I do **not** believe in a European **""us vs them""**. There are no countries in the EU that are  ""hopeless"" or ""lagging behind the others"". I simply don't think that's the correct way to conceptualize the problem, and in addition, thinking and phrasing it like that will have an antagonizing effect, and we're not going to change anything.

I **do** believe that some countries have, for reasons that are beyond my knowledge, an unfortunate set of institutions/mechanisms/social rules. In fact, almost *all* countries have some crappy social mechanisms. Example? Maybe Southern Italy has a tax evasion problem. Sure, but Southern Germany, the industrial powerhouse of my country, has a major ""keep your nose out of my business"" problem. I've lived there long enough to say that, especially in rural areas, a lot of people have a tendency to judge you and complain when you deviate from what is accepted as ""normal"" (might be similar in other countries, but I wanted to point a problematic social norm in ""my"" place).

So, the first step is to admit that *my* country's shit smells as bad as *your* country's shit. 

The next step, however, is to also be open and honest about what we're actually discussing: how the economy works. And in this case, yes, ""my"" country's shit smells a bit less, as does that of the North in general. I guess our social mechanisms are a bit better at handling large-scale cooperative behavior and promoting efficiency of transactions for the (at least monetary) benefit of everybody. Hence, the North has a higher GDP per capita. 

There are other reasons for this wealth, such as natural resources, maybe some post-colonial benefits, but institutions play a large part, as I'm pretty sure everybody who's not completely bound to follow a marxist theory will see.

**tl;dr** Please don't read my post and think ""He's right, the North is so much better than the South"". What I'm actually saying is much smaller: a) some social mechanisms in the South are not compatible with a modern economy, b) the social mechanisms that are better for a modern economy are perhaps more prevalent in the North, but Northerners sure as hell shouldn't pat themselves on the back for having those, because individually, they had very little to do with installing them.",0,1341254527,null,0,1341319166,0,c58iqap,t3_vxjol,t1_c58iqap,t3_vxjol,null,1429280617,60,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,60

Say that the problems in Greece are entirely down to institutions, and the people powerless to step in and reverse the situation. If the Greek people trusted the German people, they would be happy for German representatives to come in and reconstitute their institutions. But that is what is happening, with the memorandum, and the response is very widespread hostility.

Also, I am confused about the reality of differences in culture; but those differences, if they exist, do not necessarily have to be framed in terms of chauvinism, but rather a grand and rational philosophical disagreement. One side says that prosperity is there in service to a good life, and the other says that prosperity is its own end. These are both perfectly valid attitudes, and I would actually tend towards the hypothetical 'Southern' attitude- if it's a question of whether I get to spend time with my children, or maintain my health, then I'm perfectly happy to give up some wealth and luxury to that end.

you are here on a visa meaning you will have to check with **your home insurance** what is covered while you are here on tourist visa - and that could be ugly.

entering germany in order to work is not something which is allowed per se and getting a work visa because you want to job around as an english tutor is not going to be easy either.

you will have to check up first on how to get your visa straightened out - I don't know if they will deport you if they find you working, but chances are, nobody will hire you if you have not sorted that out. once you have whatever kind of visa is needed (and no tourist visa is just that!!), then you can apply for insurance.

I beg to disagree. For one, if institutions were linked to a local culture, then how come they can change so drastically, given time. Also, why then, if you have families relocating from one country to another, do they often enough adapt to the local culture? Finally, for now I am content saying that we simply don't know enough how institutions are established and preserved, but assuming that the individual can simply step up and change them, on a whim, seems a bit naive -- it *can* happen, and I would argue that a drastic change towards much worse institutions was what happened when the Weimar Republic turned into the 3rd Reich, but you cannot *count* on such drastic changes, and you certainly cannot simply expect them of people.

Ideally, we would be in the city, but after doing some looking (my husband was just in Siena last weekend looking at places) we've come to the conclusion that we can't afford it. So, we've started looking in the surrounding area. We would need to have a reliable way to get to and from the city each day (i.e., a bus), so that's probably the most important feature for us in trying to find an appropriate place outside of Siena.

What you've said about the rental agencies is interesting because my husband and I have gotten the opposite impression about rentals and leases. The person renting the place he and some Italian friends (who are from the area) went to see recently offered no lease, and the Italians he was with said that that is pretty common with individuals who are leasing apartments. They actually suggested that we *do* go through an agency, that way we're guaranteed to have a contract.

What you've said about utilities coheres with what his Italian cohorts said, so I'll definitely keep that in mind.

I'm a bit concerned about the internet connectivity issue, because I definitely need to have an internet connection for my job while we're overseas. I'll have to look into that a bit more.

Do you happen to know which towns outside of Siena have a regular bus service into Siena? Or at least a website with some maps and/or bus routes?

And to make things worse, EU decided that 4 out of 8 GM foods don't have to be labelled at all; so taxing them would not work (and I'm sure that GM lobby would stop any movement in that direction).

Frankly, EU really lost a lot of 'democracy' points in my book with this thing, as that showed me that they are for selling to the highest bidder (at least in some situations). And it happened almost immediately after signing the Lisbon treaty, that didn't help for the EU's image.

As for the president thing, he is put in place by European Council, not by Parliament (I was thinking about von Rompuy). As for comparing EU president with monarchies in EU, all of monarchies in EU are just for show and don't hold any real power (and, as they are just an relic of old times, their power is degrading with time). EU president will just have more and more power over the time, right now he is not that important but that quite probably will change in (near) future.

Also, I don't know if you saw [this](http://dotsub.com/view/01ad2718-073c-474a-ac40-c7a72e199d55). I would be very, very worried to give those people more power. They decide for five hundred million people, and if we don't like it - well, basically we can't do a thing about it. You can't pay millions of people from Greece or Portugal or Italy or any other country to go to protest in Brussel; while they had their local politicians messing the things up, at least they could throw them to the street.

Also, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZZMXNr95Zs) is really dangerous and it scares me. It would be really, really dangerous to give complete immunity to few bankers, and at the same time give them power to indebt any EU member state they want for whatever amount they please. Luckily, most of the states are against it (for now at least).

To clarify things, I am not against EU *per se*, but I have some real problems with how it functions right now, and particularly with its monetary policy. For now, I would like that EU has less power over member states, until it proves that it is really a democratic union. Preferably, I would like EU to function as the USA used to function and as it is written in their constitution - states had almost all the power, and federal government was there just to uphold the law and print the (non-credit) money.

true,Mr_Lantin,GERM,Germany,"I think I know what you mean and I am somewhat glad someone else said it first. You mentioned institutions; I guess that was more of a rhetorical ""Sorry-for-what-I-just-said"" than what you really meant. Institutions as you mentioned them are an expression of a more general culture.

How do people react around you if you're faced with a naive stranger? Are you seen as a moron for not taking advantage of the situation? Or would you be shunned if you tried to get the better of him?

I had this discussion with Brazilian friends of mine who were complaining about how their own society was developing in the former direction. It made me think about this expression I heard so often: ""You always meet twice. - Man sieht sich immer zweimal im Leben."" In German, the meaning is clear: don't screw anyone over; now he might be exploitable, next time, maybe you are in the weaker position.
