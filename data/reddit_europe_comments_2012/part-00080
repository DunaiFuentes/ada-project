Well, birth control and women's liberation/emancipation happened, among other things.  
I don't see those proverbial genies ever being put back in the bottle.

Plus, the costs associated with kids seems to have grown exponentially. From diapers to university education to the parents' not needing kids for care in their old age anymore. Also, many folks now don't feel pressure from society/peers/norms/family/religious leaders etc. anymore either.

The way I see it is that we've reached peak-humanity as a normal result of our modern surroundings.  
Think about it this way: if tomorrow World War III breaks out and we're all blown back to the stone age, those who survive will be back to having big families by default.

Food is more expensive, but the quality is better too. Buying quality in the US is more expensive than in France I think.

Rent would be your biggest cost and you can get decent rentals if you look around. You would likely have less space than in the US but it's not a big deal. You adapt.

Clothes on the other hand are definitely more expensive, and most of the time the quality isn't better if you're in a run of the mill shop like Jules or Celio.

Where once you could line up voters' preferences on one axis (e.g left to right) and then later on two axes (progressive to conservative) it now seems that with every voting cycle multiple new axes (or dimensions) are being added to the matrix.  
For the September elections we have a big new axis: ""Do you want more or less EU?""  
Two big-polling parties (PVV and SP) want LESS, a few parties are outspoken for MORE and the rest are ""whatevah!"" about it.

People just have so much information that we now have the luxury of developing an opinion on EVERY fucking nuance and now it's the *parties* playing catch-up trying to scoop up as much of the torrent of ideas and opinions being spewed by voters everywhere (and them ending up looking like fakes in the eyes of the voters for doing exactly that in the process).

Just think of the cartoon where someone's plugging a hole in a concrete dam with a finger, and then another hole appears... and then another. Now a few seconds later theres millions of holes everywhere and the cartoon figure is stretched out all over the dam, grown thousands of fingers and yet water is gushing through the cracks.

Bottom line:

NO WAY will our system be able to cope any longer with all of us millions of individuals demanding the most disparate things from the gov't.  
Eventually we will need to have a frank debate what the gov't should provide for us all, and what it will have to relegate to the public again.  
It'll just have to pull back and drop responsibilities *en masse* if it's ever going to regain the trust and consent of an über-demanding electorate.  

Just as the world's societies have decentralized (e.g. you can be in contact with anyone and everyone even while being in the middle of the Sahara or on top of Mount Everest for fuck's sake) so too will those control mechanisms have to decentralize right along with us.

Sure, except that the guy in question has practically no powers (in day-to-day politics at least). 

I don't mind such a position being there to guard the constitutional order or ceremoniously represent a block or chair meetings, or even co-decide on some sensitive areas (say who gets to be a general - since each one is a potential coup leader - or troop deployment outside one's territory) and represent the people's interest independently from (and against,as an extra check) the parliament via such delay vetos like a constitutionality checks or triggering referenda on laws or actions of the executive he/she finds problematic.

But the actual, effective executive can be censured in the parliament by a normal majority (well, possibly an initiative for a referenda could trigger early elections and a new government too, not quite sure, since the direct democracy mechanisms in our constitution are still mostly unused) in almost all countries in europe. And in the current European Union. 

And this keeps the relative strength of the executive far more subdued than in presidential systems, which is democratically desirable, since most abuses of the populace will come from the actions of the executive (EDIT: and other reasons, noted below)

Imho, it would be more sensible to build upon this, existing system.

I should clarify, I do like the current proposals for the chair of the european council to be a directly elected president. Only I wouldn't risk giving him much more than ceremonial powers. 

&gt;it works okay in the United States 

I don't think anything about United States democracy works okay, least of all the institution of the president. Because of the inherent power of managing the executive, that institution has been able to expand its powers vs the other parts of the system, to the point of not even having to have parliamentary assent for military interventions!

&gt;No, I was referring to the recent calls for a sort-of direct election of the president of the European Commission by having all of the political blocs say before the parliamantary election who they intend to vote for,

Ah, yeah, that's true. Well, that's not a direct election, but a parliamentary convention common in many parliamentary system - simply a matter of voters being informed what they're voting for. Barosso was the candidate of the people's party this round, and they were the strongest, so it was kinda implemented. But the social democrats couldn't agree on a countercandidate. 

And neither was chosen particularly transparently - even in countries that don't have direct primaries, at least they've got one member one vote elections for top party seats. While party groups in the european parliament still act as a loose confederation of parties, w no such general assembly of members. That's one point in election and party law I think needs to be changed with harmonisation of election and party rules for the european parliament

&gt;You keep saying that the only directly elected institution is the most democractically problematic. How so?

Well, a single person, by this very fact can represent only a minority position. perhaps that minority makes up a plurality or perhaps he/she is a 'lesser evil' compromise.

We could see how unrepresentative this can be w/o a sophisticated election system in recent Egyptian elections. Low turnout, divisive candidates, and they even elect him/her in two rounds, as an extra precaution in comparison to the US model.

I guess a monotonic preferential system like Schulze Condorcet could guarantee such a person is at least a majority-preference compromise, if such exists among the candidates, but no country has used such a system to speak of this w actual experience.

Or perhaps he/she is a liar that intends to ignore what he/she said during the campaign, and say try pushing a fractional programme after painting oneself a moderate.

Danger that exists with a parliament too, ofc. However, a proportional parliament and resulting coalition politics can (though needn't) create significant tensions for a government on such a course. And the government can be removed then. Initiative for a referenda for early elections can ofc also be an option

There is no recourse at all for removal in this system, except if the president is doing something actually illegal in your system. And even that can't pass if he has even a significant but still minority backing in the parliament.

That's why I though at least a recall referenda and say a supermajority censure of him is necessary yet missing there.

Furthermore, given a proportional parliament, it as a collective body can easily represent a large part of the population, rather just a single fraction in it like the president (well, yeah presidents tend to exit their backing political party ant try to leave some impression of being non-partisan, but people continue to perceive them as partisan). This is quite visible in the typical turnout levels in proportional parliaments vs majoritarian systems.

&gt;I wanted to give the President additional legitimacy beyond that and therefore removed the ""proxy"", leaving only the nomination in the hands of the Parliament. 

I don't think ppl perceive their prime ministers as lacking legitimacy because they're elected through the parliamentary majorities in national elections, precisely because this 'proxy direct election' through candidacies is as clear as direct elections would be - ppl care mostly to elect a new government, and the parliamentary composition resulting from it is pretty incidental.

EDIT: Or the extent to which they do perceive his/her legitimacy limited ,or rather, dependent on the parliament is desirable, because then they'd find it less acceptable for the executive to accrete further power, like it seems to happen in the US, 

Ofc coalition formation may not be what they expected when voting...

&gt;but a sort-of-new start may also be an opportunity to clean house and get rid of regulations that aren't necessary and/or are better handled on a state or regional level. 

Honestly, I'd rather you just voted for exiting the EU :) I don't wish to economically cooperate with a country that doesn't operate under a similar regulatory system to our own, so as to ensure for example that the capital mobility is not the overall winner at the expense of labor mobility, or that the health and safety or labour rights protections are not put into a race to the bottom etc. 

I'd love it if (most of) CAP funding was scrapped, but apart from that I wouldn't really agree to european economic cooperation much less integrated than EEA is currently.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; That's very illuminating, but sort of misses the larger problem, which is the off-balance sheet liabilities of the banks. 

Well, it's not besides the point I was trying to make. :)

I keep hearing this line about the bailout all being some sort of a ploy to indirectly bail out German banks. Of course that's true, in a way -- in the end, they'd be affected, hard, because the default of one country could easily cascade throughout the system. But it's not surprising that the banks of the largest economy in Europe also lent out the most. In proportion to GDP, German banks don't really stand out. And it doesn't change the fact that the countries that would default would be hit the hardest by far.

You're right, though, that those instruments are a problem. Depending on how CDS' are used, they can be insurances or essentially just bets, and because they're unregulated nobody knows how many are out there. (Well, [this organisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_Corporation) seems to know, but I don't know where to look.) Hopefully our politicians will get around doing something about that some time, because as a tax payer I don't like it when banks can happily make money by selling insurances during the good times but come running for me to bail them out for when they come due. 

The problem with CDS' is that you can use them to insure (or, ""insure"", depending how legitimate your need to be insured against something is in the first place) yourself against the default of an entity you haven't even lent money to. But on the other hand, there are legitimate usages because the default of an entity often affects more than just the creditors.  
Let's imagine a small market that consists of us two, Greece, an Italian manufacturer of olive oil presses, and a speculator that I'll call Joe. You've bought Greek government bonds, at a time when it seemed like a safe investment. You buy a CDS from me to insure yourself against a Greek default. Now Papandreou announces that there may be some inaccuracies with their books, and suddenly the risk assessment I have based the price for the CDS I sold you is off, so I insure myself in case I have to pay you by buying a CDS myself. I might even buy it from you. It costs me more than what I've gotten for the one I sold to you earlier, but still much less than what I'd have to pay out in case of a default. Now the situation in Greece worsens further, and on the whole, you're looking at a net loss in case of a Greek default (your original bond plus one CDS you sold to me vs. one I sold to you), but on the other hand you've made a profit (what I payed you for that CDS minus what you payed me for yours earlier when the risk was lower). We do this back and forth each time the probability of a default changes, because we're not really trading insurances, but risk. In the process, we've pumped up the total volume of CDS' for Greek government bonds, even though the net amount in case of a ""credit event"" would be equal to the face value of your original bond, which you have long sold for a loss on the secondary market.  
At some point, the Italian manufacturer of olive oil presses is getting worried. He understands that, if Greece defaults, their banks go bust and can't lend to Greek olive oil manufacturers anymore, so they can't invest into new olive oil presses, which would mean he'd lose a lot of business. He does the smart thing and insures himself against such an event, which is perfectly legitimate. But now Joe comes along and notices there's a lot of money to be made off a potential Greek default. He doesn't have any Greek bonds and doesn't even do any business with Greece, but ""insures"" himself anyway. While he's at it, he buys CDS' to ""insure"" himself against one of us defaulting, from the other, respectively. He's essentially just placing bets. Joe's the problem here.

So, yes, I do remember that. I used to be really worried about them when Greece defaulted, but in the end, the total payout turned out to be only $2.4bn. One Google search snipped from the WSJ dated January 20th (may be when the Google bot last visited it) shows the line ""Net volume of Greek CDS: $3.2 billion; gross volume tops $70 billion"", but now 404s.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; How do we make it normal again for a family to have 2 children?

I have my first daughter on the way. One thing is clear, she's going to be an only child. We just don't have the money to raise two kids, and provide them with decent education, and we never will. We're going to be struggling on just my salary alone for the first year, and after that, even if my wife decides to go back to work, most of her salary would go on childcare. We're also going to be stuck in rented accommodation, forever. That is not ideal, as it reduces stability as you can never be sure when you'll be asked to pay more rent, or asked to move on. On my salary we'll never get a mortgage on anything other than a one bedroom flat, which would be too small for a family of three. My salary is not likely to increase very much over time.

I'm guessing the core problem is old people hanging on to a vast chunk of the wealth. In the UK, that equates to property. The amount of money I spend paying off someone else's mortgage each month is *insane*. It's most of what I earn. Just living shouldn't cost this much. 

What can we do about it? Nothing. We are completely powerless. Old people vote more often, and like any group, they vote in line with their own interests. Having a house-price crash is not in their interests, even if it is in mine.

I feel a bit guilty for saying this, but, from my perspective the ""best"" thing that could happen is a nice big flu epidemic that takes about 10% of the population, mostly oldies. If that ever happens, I predict we'll have a massive baby boom within years (as the price of living suddenly drops).

In that one, the question is how to best protect women from being forced into prostitution, by banning the practice or by regulating it. We've tried the ban, it didn't work, so now we have regulation. What
both have in common is that it's the religious folks who have strong opinions either for or against a practice, when it should default to basic secular principles (freedom to do business and from bodily harm, respectively) and only be messed with if there are adverse effects (exploitation of women or in this case potentially greater harm through botched butchering jobs).

With circumcision, it's the other way round. It used to be regulated (parental consent, no rusty scissors in back alleys), but the rights of the child were violated, so now we try a ban. Let's see how this works out, if it helps the tourism industry of neighboring countries, good for them, no elevated risk for the boys there. I don't think any basement circumcisions will result in babies bleeding to death, but if infections turn into a problem we may have to look into it again.

Simple... because his agenda is ""being the voice of those without a voice in the gilded corridors of power"".  
Wilders only takes the concerns of those unwashed voters who are considered ""useless"" by all the other parties. The voters who hold ""politically unacceptable"" opinions and positions.

Neither has it impacted my life in any particularly negative way.

While I'm opposed to any sort of involuntary circumcision done when the child can remember the experience (from the age of 3 and upward IIRC), I don't think it's a problem at all to be circumcised at birth, when it won't cause any trauma. Passing laws like this, as has been mentioned before, will only cause the practice to go underground. Instead of doing it at hospitals, where it'd be performed by certified doctors, the practice is going to revert to being done inside people's homes, at houses of prayer, or wherever else they would see it fit to perform it. While most religions also have people who're specialized in circumcision, there are still many who would not be properly certified to perform one at a hospital, and this will only increase the risk of botched circumcision and genital damage.

&gt; The problem with prostitution is that it requires desperate people.

Cheap and exploitative prostitution requires desperate people, and a ban won't stop it, it will only keep the affected women from getting help. Regulated prostitution by women who see it as a job should result in less demand for the exploitative kind. I've never been with a prostitute, but I suspect the service is better when they got into it voluntarily.  
AFAIK, the rules in Germany are that prostitution is legal, but pimping is not. The problem of course is that this isn't easy to enforce, but it gives exploited women the option to go to the police without incriminating themselves, and brothels aren't underground so checking for women that have been brought here illegally to be exploited is easy. It's far from perfect, but probably more effective than a ban.

Indeed. The situation is very bad, but shit like this provide a disservice. I suspect that a journalist from a press agency did not pay much attention when translating, and others started copying from there.

According to [the latest research](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:U-FJ5oV6m9wJ:www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/ESYE/BUCKET/A0802/PressReleases/A0802_SFA10_DT_AN_00_2010_01_F_GR.pdf+%CF%8C%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BF+%CF%86%CF%84%CF%8E%CF%87%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B1%CF%82+%CE%B5%CE%BB%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%84&amp;hl=el&amp;gl=gr&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjsJGdjuBFxQlqO_v2Ojody6_-6whBabbQYSEf7lBNuo3Zva96-6BX_YJjh6SERZLCc4dRo7WKrEw9uGzuhcJ4WUDShNkhr-InUq4-uTgXE-4H3vweWTdTtfWPYIWT7JkYn94tv&amp;sig=AHIEtbTlxreAfhfsH72-eLMJNwzBsmXPbg), the limit for one person living alone was €7.178.

20,1% of the households was ""at risk"". That gives us up to 2,2m people. However, according to the research, [if we include all vulnerable and socially excluded groups](http://www.greekmoney.gr/index.php/permalink/76796.html), the real number is about 3m.

Given that this research is about 2010, and after taking into account the recent census, we can safely assume that 1 in 3 Greeks is below or at risk of crossing the poverty line. This is still a huge number. Also, don't forget that the tax-free allowance (€5.000) is now below the poverty line, which is ridiculous. The poor people always paid their taxes, the rich were the ones that frequently tried to avoid it. An example showing the absurdity of the system: if you're a pensioner getting €683 per month, you'll pay nothing (limit increases for over-65s), if you're getting €684, you'll pay €400 (you lose the increased limit).",0,1340883121,null,0,1340884762,0,c56q3sd,t3_vppwj,t1_c56q3sd,t1_c56p5sk,null,1429249752,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

I used to be a member of the party, but I stopped voting for them about six years ago. My father was very active in GreenLeft as well, but he resigned about half a year ago or so, I think. I support the Socialists now, he's politically homeless.

I guess Halsema and now especially, Jolanda Sap, are taking their inspiration from the German Greens and how they moved to the right. But I don't think it will work out for them.

I'll just paste a comment I've made in the other thread, where somebody suggested it wold probably come down to confusing questions:

[This PDF](http://www.fu-berlin.de/presse/informationen/fup/2012/fup_12_181/schaubilder_tabellen_studie.pdf) (Google Translate doesn't like it, sorry) gives some insights, although it doesn't contain the original questionnaire.

Those figures about knowing what was and what wasn't appear to be coming from [these results](http://imgur.com/a/z3qeJ). The titles are *Agreement with statement [number]: ""The [state] [was|is] not a [dictatorship|democracy] ..."" by group of origin*, from top to bottom referring to the Nazi Germany, the GDR, the old pre-Reunification Federal Republic and the Federal Republic post-Reunification today. The ""groups of origin"" are, from top to bottom, children of migrants, of parents who grew up in the GDR, in the Federal Republic, and then the total.

So, this isn't due to confusing questions, but ignorance. On the plus side, if you want to call it that, more kids know that Nazi Germany was a dictatorship than who know that they live in a democracy. Yay.

Most do, however, recognize that the Nazis were bad, *if* they know something about it. [This chart](http://i.imgur.com/KdX1X.png) shows negative assessments of Nazi Germany, the GDR, pre-Reunification FRG and post-Reunification FRG, and ""equality of the systems"" by sub-groups of very high, high, medium, low and very low level of knowledge.

Positive evaluations of the for systems by group of origin came out like [this](http://i.imgur.com/JoK20.png) (NS, old FRG, GDR, reunited Germany, by FRG parents, GDR parents, and children of migrants).

All in all, it really is pretty depressing.

&gt;Many policy makers insist that the crisis was caused by irresponsible public borrowing. With very few exceptions - other than Greece - this is false. Instead, the conditions for crisis were created by excessive private sector borrowing and lending, including by over-leveraged banks. The collapse of this bubble led to massive falls in output and thus in tax revenue. So the large government deficits we see today are a consequence of the crisis, not its cause.

*The nature of the crisis.
&gt;When real estate bubbles on both sides of the Atlantic burst, many parts of the private sector slashed spending in an attempt to pay down past debts. This was a rational response on the part of individuals, but - just like the similar response of debtors in the 1930s - it has proved collectively self-defeating, because one person’s spending is another person’s income. The result of the spending collapse has been an economic depression that has worsened the public debt.

*The appropriate response.
&gt;At a time when the private sector is engaged in a collective effort to spend less, public policy should act as a stabilizing force, attempting to sustain spending. At the very least we should not be making things worse by big cuts in government spending or big increases in tax rates on ordinary people. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what many governments are now doing.

*The big mistake.
&gt;After responding well in the first, acute phase of the economic crisis, conventional policy wisdom took a wrong turn - focusing on government deficits, which are mainly the result of a crisis-induced plunge in revenue, and arguing that the public sector should attempt to reduce its debts in tandem with the private sector. As a result, instead of playing a stabilizing role, fiscal policy has ended up reinforcing the dampening effects of private-sector spending cuts.",0,1340890633,null,0,false,0,c56r5ef,t3_vqmw2,t1_c56r5ef,t3_vqmw2,null,1429250244,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

we can see angela merkel as the goalkeeper in front of a football goal with a yellow top, white gloves and black shorts. all the other nation heads are on the ground, wearing bright-blue shirts with their flags printed on the frontside and dark shorts. A ball in the form of an euro coin is currently flying into the goal, but angela merkel doesn't seem to care about it. in the background we can also see a man in a suit, probably making a commentary over the ongoing game.

.

so, the artist of this probably wants to say that angela merkel doesn't care about the euro crisis and that all other member states are unable to help any further with the solution of the problem. also, as the ball has already passed her, she would not be able to prevent that goal anymore. it is a done deal.

.

i can't agree to that for different reasons:

she isn't indifferent to the crisis. if she were, she'd be beyond stupid as it will destroy the german economy just the same as all other participating nations.

also, the other nations are shown to be either utterly useless or having fucked up so badly that they are unable to contribute to the solution of this situation.

Wir sind durch ein Höhlensystem, das vor Hunderten von Jahren von den Eingeborenen (den Taíno) genutzt wurde, gewandert. Dabei hat uns der Führer ausführlich die Lebensweise der Taíno, die Organisation ihrer Gesellschaft sowie die Geschichte der Großen Antillen näher gebracht. Er hat uns Artefakte und traditionelle Hütten gezeigt, und wir konnten sogar typische Getränke und Speisen der Taíno probieren. Der Kaffee und die heiße Schokolade haben unglaublich gut geschmeckt!
Die Taíno-Tour beinhaltet den Transport vom Hotel sowie die geführte Tour zu den Höhlen und dem Taíno-Dorf. Außerdem gibt es noch den Eco-Pfad ""Auf den Spuren der Heilpflanzen"", auf dem wir sehr viel über Heilpflanzen, Früchte und Gemüsesorten, die von den Eingeborenen nicht nur zum Kochen, sondern auch zur Behandlung von Verletzungen und Krankheiten verwendet wurden, gelernt haben. Dazu haben wir auch noch einen Snack und Getränke bekommen. Du solltest die Tour unbedingt auch machen, wenn du nach Punto Cana kommst…""",0,1340896060,null,0,1340896268,0,c56sdvg,t3_vqo5p,t1_c56sdvg,t3_vqo5p,null,1429250826,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

Just 70 for bills? Really? In the last appartment I was living in I was paying:

 * Electricity: 60 per month
 * Phone/Internet: 25 per month
 * Water: 5 per month
 * Common expenses (koinoxrista): 30 during the summer / 120 during the winter (heating costs!)

Total: 120 during the summer / 210 during the winter.

Just 120 for food? This is even more amazing! This means that you managed to feed yourselves (and feed them well, as you say) for about 2 euros per person per day. This is an unbelievably low number. You understand that 1 (one) souvlaki costs 2 euros (in many places more) already. One spanakopita costs 2 euros. A plain loaf of bread costs 1 euro. A chicken sandwich costs about 2.5 euros. If you are very frugal, never eat out and always cook your own food (of course, I'm not advocating ordering food, that's for rich people), you *might* approach 4 euros per day PER PERSON (that's 240 per month for two persons). Double your estimate. And that's not eating well, that's eating spaghetti with ketchup all the time. Keep in mind that 1 (one) slightly big raw pork steak will cost about 2 euros right from the butcher, already maxing out your numbers. Do your calculations again, maybe you have missed something.

100 for transport seems about right, no objections there. Do you own a car? What about the car's insurance (200 per six months, ~30 per month). What about the car's tax (another 10 per month). That leaves about 60 for gas. That's not much gas. I'm not even going to mention car service, let's say that it will never need any (not likely). Notice that you said that *both* partners must be working in order to be able to afford a car. Not very likely these days, one of the two will probably be unemployed. No car for single persons, then.

What about the rest? Supermarket for example (you know, toilet and kitchen paper, toothpaste, *maybe* some deodorant, *maybe* some shaving foam plus the million other common things a household needs, do I need to list them all?). Clothing? Any other unforeseen expenses?

I don't think I overstated my numbers. Your quote (400 for two people) is an amazingly low estimate.

I mean, how many people go to a sports festival like football and discuss politics, social structures and democracy? (because if you dont you are a nationalist and thus basically a nazi).

I am 41 and I feel like that comic every time. ""Wait what there are flags? Oh good it is football, we are allowed to do that. 

As a nation even in the global / european context, we need to learn our identiy first to be able to understand what it means in comparison. If all of those Germans where hidden Nazis (this is what the article basically is hinting at) they would use oh so many other occasions to go for it - they don't)

Let me compare that to alcohol: You cannot learn moderate drinking if all you ever do is be 100% abstinent and every two years you are allowed a blackout from drinking. This is teaching you abstinence or being 100% drunk but not what moderation means. 1 glas per day? per week? And so on. 

And the comic is spot on: 
""In Scandinavia we use our flags completely different, but it’s not like in North America where you see flags everywhere as a sign of national pride.


Every time we have a celebration of any kind we raise the flags, because here our flags doesn’t so much symbolise national pride as much as it has become a symbol of happiness, joy and having a good time. And something I haven’t seen in other countries is that we use it when celebrating birthdays. So if you walk by a house here and see 20 small flags in the front yard, it’s not because the people living there are nationalists. It just means someone is celebrating their birthday.""

true,TerribleTacoBak,null,null,"&gt; well, possibly an initiative for a referenda could trigger early elections and a new government too

I don't think many (or any?) of the ""older"" democracies in the EU have federal/nationwide recall referenda either for individual politicians or an entire government. Provisions like that exist only on a regional level, to my knowledge; but I'll admit I don't know the ""Eastern"" democracies very well. 

&gt; I don't think anything about United States democracy works okay

I disagree. It's slow to adapt to changing realities, needs to be reformed, and the politicians need to develop a different culture of cooperation, but its general structure works. It's been a stable system for over 200 years. You have to remember how the U.S. came into being in the first place. The original colonies were united in their fight against the British, but otherwise very different and wanted to maintain as much independence from a central government as possible. They still have far more domestic competences than many states/regions in European countries relative to the respective national/federal level. 

That doesn't mean that's the **only** way wildly different sovereign states can be wrangled to work together and surrender some of their powers to a united government, but it's clearly a workable way and Europeans would do well not to dismiss it completely. 

&gt; , least of all the institution of the president. Because of the inherent power of managing the executive, that institution has been able to expand its powers vs the other parts of the system, to the point of not even having to have parliamentary assent for military interventions!

That's because Congress is overly politicized and full of cowards. They could curb the executive overreach if they actually wanted to. 

&gt; While party groups in the european parliament still act as a loose confederation of parties, w no such general assembly of members. That's one point in election and party law I think needs to be changed with harmonisation of election and party rules for the european parliament

I'm generally against introducing new laws that aren't necessary. I like the fact that the parliamentary groups are looser than traditional parties, because traditional parties have a tendency to enforce strict discipline and curb dissent within their own side. The groups will develop more structure over time anyway; it's better to let it happen organically. 

Lisbon already allows the formation of proper pan-European parties, if I'm not mistaken; it's up to the voters to support them if that's what they want. 

&gt; There is no recourse at all for removal in this system, except if the president is doing something actually illegal in your system. And even that can't pass if he has even a significant but still minority backing in the parliament.

That was kind of the idea. But the more I think about it, the more I agree that the President should only be able to cast a delaying veto (which can be ignored with a supermajority), or send the bill off to the Supreme Court (which cannot). That's in line with the duties he already has under the proposal, after all. With his powers reduced that way (he will still be able to suggest new laws via the Cabinet, but won't be able to block them completely), impeachment as the only means of removal should be fine. 

&gt; I don't think ppl perceive their prime ministers as lacking legitimacy because they're elected through the parliamentary majorities in national elections, precisely because this 'proxy direct election' through candidacies is as clear as direct elections would be - ppl care mostly to elect a new government, and the parliamentary composition resulting from it is pretty incidental.

You're right, but the EU isn't a country now and wouldn't be (yet) under the proposal. It wouldn't need a prime minister because the executive's powers would be limited mostly to administration and oversight and pretty much no decisions could be made without the support of either the full Parliament or one of the committees. The voluntary treaties would have to find individual solutions specifying who assumes what role in case nimble and quick decisions need to be reached on one of those issues. 

Add to that that the European Union itself has legitimacy problems right now because it is viewed as intransparent, overly bureaucratic, not democratic enough, and too aloof (all of which are true). Involving the people by letting them elect their own President is one of many steps that should help with that. At some point in the future, I wouldn't mind at all if the nomination process moved from Parliament to national and then Europe-wide primaries (though the election itself should be a two-step election, as in France). 

&gt; I should continue with this post further, I'm sorry if I sounded overly irritated yesterday, was a bit tired, and you can see I don't agree with the overall direction of this approach.

It's okay. It's refreshing to have a frank discussion of fundamental politics at all; ""old Europe"" and ""old America"" are a little burned out.

I have been *very* fat in the past and I can put it all back just by eating fried potatoes. Maybe you're one of the lucky ones that can eat cheap (and tasty!) food and get away with it. I sure can't.

&gt; Bread(enough for a day) costs 0.60 and that's the fancy bread. In the foreign shops you should be able to find it for as much as 0.30. (no, really)

By 'fancy' you mean from a normal bakery, right? We don't have any foreign shops where I live, although I'd very much like to try some of that bread.

&gt; The car - well, that's not cheap. I was just thinking about the monthly cards that allow you to use whatever public transport you wish, and cost, what, 40 &gt; euros per person? You could as well buy the ones that are only for bus/tram/trol and it will be a total of 40 for both, but no metro, yeah. With a little luck
&gt; you can find metro tickets at stations and use them right then, people leave them at the stairs.

Yeah, I know. I have a card. It's 45 for all means of transport (even the subway, just not to the airport). Look, you're talking to a guy that has already minimized all of his expenses. My commuting to work includes two full hours of walking *every* day, plus another hour riding the subway. Half of my food comes from my parents and this does not make me proud. No money left for cinema or coffee. I froze my ass during the winter, since I could not afford to turn on the apartment's heaters. However, I'm one of the lucky ones, because I am comparatively young and I don't have any children. What about those who are above 45 or have children to raise?

Maybe all this is normal to you, but most other people call it 'being very poor'.

It could be argued that creating the Euro before the EU became an optimal currency area was a mistake, Prof. Krugman makes that argument all the time, but even the Euro's harshest critics would say that it was created with the best intentions. Instead he seems to be claiming that Prof. Mundell was is a puppet master manipulating political leaders across the continent in order to create the Euro as part of some grand conspiracy of evil.
 
Talking fantasies of evil intent I guess that we are supposed to go ""boo ... hiss"" at the mention of Milton Friedman, who he clearly believes is some kind of pantomime villain. Unfortunately he fails to mention the fact that Prof Friedman was not pressing for the Euro's creation while rubbing his hands together with maniacal delight. Like Prof. Krugman, Prof Friedman predicted that the Euro would not go well, and so advised against creating it.

Again he fails to mention that Mrs. Thatcher was in reality against the Euro, and so can hardly have been part of an evil cabal determined to introduce it in order to wage class war on the plumbers of Europe.

I am a Romanian working for a Norwegian company (with co-workers from across Scandinavia) and I think these are the differences between typical Balkanian/Eastern European thinking and Scandinavian thinking:

* **fairness**: Scandinavians are concerned with fairness, even if it's for other people, not for themselves. Balkanians speak out against lack of fairness only if they're involved.
* **equality**: regardless of rank or wealth, Scandinavians are not smug with their co-workers. also, when someone does something wrong, they don't impale him/her
* **calmness**: I have yet to see an angry Scandinavian, a state that was the default for some people in some Romanian companies where I worked.
* **constructiveness**: when things go wrong, the first thing that Romanians think is finding the culpable, Scandinavians try to fix the actual problem.

You may think that these things are small, but it's a world of difference for the workers.

In the Balkans, the people hate their job and their boss and as soon as the boss looks away, they stop doing anything.

Number two, you make the huge assumption, that if you give someone 1 million Euros to invest through a structural fund, he will NOT move it directly to a Swiss bank.  Capital, the way it has been developed in Northern Europe and the US is almost a religious process of acquiring money-power and technology. In the rest of the world people take the money and go somewhere and relax or invest in assets that are extremely risk averse.

The Greek private sector for example has ton of resources, massive unemployment, an over-educated population willing to work for experience. Yet you get zero investments. Money is just sitting in Swiss bank accounts, and will keep on being there no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try and what incentives you give (bar slavery, and that only if government subsidises it heavily). Whatever foreign investments could have been made, have been made already, buying up large public infrastructure companies. 

I'll close with a prediction here. Unemployment in Southern Europe will get higher then WWII Germany, while at the same time market will be deregulated completely (it already is mostly). Where we go from there I don't know, but the current economic model will fail so badly, you might end up burning your MBA.

To point out one of the biggest reason why running a business in Greece is hard, and what also is true with other southern European countries, is that business don't have flexibility, they are strangled by government and labour regulations. For example I work in a IT-consultancy, in the last few years we have had shred almost 30-40% of our workforce due to big client shutting down projects. If the firm couldn't fire people at ease and instead would either had to keep them or pay big penalties to fire them, the whole company would have gone bust. Actually the company wouldn't ever have grown this big if there would be bigger labour risks. Now because of having more flexibility, while shredding jobs in one place, the company has tried and succeeded in expanding in other customer segments and been able to hire new people to fulfil those opportunities.

Most Greek businesses treat their employers as independent agents, They can be hired and fired at will (a practice known as ""blockaki""). There are strong unions only in the public sectors and these are in full alignment with the government, and they only include older employees. Younger teachers (less then 40) for example are hired every year in Autumn and fired every summer (this has been common for years, prior to the austerity package). 

You guys try to solve the problem by doing what was already done in the 80s/90s, deregulating labour. You can deregulate the deregulated all you want by ruberstamping some agreements that the market or government never respected anyways. 

This is another crisis of capitalism, and you are running out of tools to handle it. The only thing left to do is depress wages so much that they go sub-Bulgaria or china. I am sure you will go down this route. What I want to see is what you will come up when this proves inefficient as well.

I, for one, don't believe the electorate is ""a bunch of unruly voters who don't know what's good for them"" like some other people seem to believe. I believe that the electorate is intelligent enough to realize that governing involves making compromises. The majority of political parties in the Netherlands, however, seem to make hard promises on specific policies (so-called ""breekpunten"") and attack each other on these same specific policies (trivial issues such as ""het kwartje van Kok"", or ""kopvoddentaks"", for example), with disastrous results. It means that far too much of the public debate is taken up by specifics rather than governing philosophy. 

Hence why the electorate is spoiled. When a child is spoiled, you blame the parents. When an electorate is spoiled, you blame political institutions. The political spectrum is incredibly fractured at the moment, it's up to the political parties to fix it.

&gt;The origin of male circumcision is not known with certainty. Various theories have been proposed as to how it began, including:

* As a religious sacrifice

* As a rite of passage marking a boy's entrance into adulthood

* As a form of sympathetic magic to ensure virility or fertility

* As a means of enhancing sexual pleasure

* As an aid to hygiene where regular bathing was impractical

* As a means of marking those of higher social status

* As a means of humiliating enemies and slaves by symbolic castration

* As a means of differentiating a circumcising group from their non-circumcising neighbors

* As a means of discouraging masturbation or other socially proscribed sexual behaviors

* As a means of removing ""excess"" pleasure

* As a means of increasing a man's attractiveness to women

* As a demonstration of one's ability to endure pain

* As a male counterpart to menstruation or the breaking of the hymen

* To copy the rare natural occurrence of a missing foreskin of an important leader

Not sure why you think that supports your point. If I'm counting correctly, your reason is just 1 of 14 listed here. Further, take a look at this;

&gt;A 1987 study found that the most prominent reasons US parents choose circumcision were ""*concerns about the attitudes of peers and their sons' self concept in the future,*"" rather than medical concerns.[146] However, a later study speculated that an *increased recognition of the potential benefits of neonatal circumcision* may have been responsible for the observed increase in the US rate between 1988 and 2000.[147] A report by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality placed the 2005 national circumcision rate at 56%.[148] Most recently, the Centers for Disease control used the Charge Data Master [CDM] from SDIHealth to estimate that **54.7% of American newborn males were circumcised in 2010** .[149] 

Very few of that 54.7% were for religious reasons. So, I'm really failing to see any supporting evidence for your assertion.

Its not that long ago when people in bad years had to put sawn bites from wood into flours to enable have enough bread.

Not to mention that people died often and they died young. When you don't have quick transportation and can't afford medicine and quality diverse food, you are in far bigger risk to die. Just last fall I visited a family grave and we looked on the tombstone and noticed my grandfathers brother, brothers wife, three sisters and parents died young and in relatively short time between each other.

The 7th Day Adventists were a what you would get if a homoeopathic 'doctor' merged with a pious Christian.

They include the Party of the Future, the Libertarian Party (again?), the Anti-Europe Party, the Platform Equal State Citizenship F/M, and the ""IQ Party: With IQ For Honesty"".

With that, there are now [35 registered political parties](http://www.kiesraad.nl/nl/Verkiezingen/Register_politieke_partijen/Register_Tweede_Kamer.html), which still include the Party for Human and Spirit you mentioned, as well as New Netherlands, Whole Netherlands, Better Netherlands, the Green Right, Save the North, the Kleptocrats (??), The Club of Non-Voters, the Party for the People, as well as the Anti-Euro Party (which is not to be confused with the above-mentioned Anti-Europe Party; this one is the latest vehicle for Utrecht's extreme-right politician Wim Vreeswijk, formerly of the Centre Party, the Centre Democrats, the Dutch Block and Party Free Utrecht).

The latter, admittedly, did slightly better than the International Communist Movement the year after (0.02%).

What tracker you use really doesn't matter, because a tracker only maintains a Infohash-&gt;Peer database. But the infohash gives no evidence about the content at all. BT uses SHA-1, which has few known collision attacks (still very hard computationally).

Even more important: Most trackers also report random peer addresses as well, so even if somebody tries to pin you down with ""tracker blabla reported IP foobar seeding infohash X"" and it's only the tracker data they're base their case on, remind them, that most trackers also generate random, fake peers. OpenTracker is among the most popular trackers and has been doing this for ages.

Also most BT clients now connect to DHT, so even if you're not using a public tracker, you may very likely connect to a public swarm and become exposed by this. But again, it's only the infohash being handed out.

The foreskin also functions as a mechanical lubricant. Uncircumcised people just don't need lubricant to masturbate. It alters the way you masturbate and as a result it also alters some of the sex mechanics.

I grew up in the 80s, and as the infographic shows, things were relatively simple in those days: you had the three main parties, the Democrats as alternative for floating voters, and what was called ""the small right"" and ""the small left"". And if any of them won 5 extra seats in elections, it was a big deal. It's a huge contrast with the fractured and volatile landscape of the last decade.

But before people like you and I get too nostalgic about the simple days of yore, recognize that this period from roughly 1977 to 1994 (and to a lessened extent onward to 2002) was the exception rather than the rule in Dutch politics. It was the result of three different Christian parties, catering to individual denominational constituencies, merging into one behemoth - and later the three ""small left"" parties merging into the Green Left. From the Second World War through to the mid-60s, discipline within each societal ""pillar"" (catholics, protestants - themselves divided by denomination - liberals, socialists and arguably communists) was strong, but in comparison to most countries that pillarization system itself was already hugely complex and fragmented.

There have definitely been somewhat similar times of flux like we are now experiencing. Go back to the make up of parliament in 1971, when secularization and ""de-pillarisation"" had already wrecked havoc, but the christian parties had not yet merged, and you had a whopping 14 parties in parliament! That's more than either of us probably witnessed consciously. None of them had more than a quarter of the vote either: there was the Labour Party with 25%, the Catholic People's Party with 22% and the VVD with 10%, four different protestant parties for the respective denominations with 9%, 6%, 2% and 2%, two center-left parties (D66 and DS70) with 7% and 5%, two parties for the disgruntled right (the Farmers Party and the National Small Business Party), and the three parties of the ""small left"" (communists, pacifist socialists and radicals).

On whether its a problem, no medical organisation in the world recommends circumcision. If the evidence we reliable it would be. There is evidence both ways but (and this is just something I looked up just now) if the research supporting the fact that STDs are more prevalent in uncircumcised men we might expect the EU to have a higher rate of HIV for example that the US as the EU has &lt;20% of men circumcised whereas the US has &gt;50% if not more. [This graph from the World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.AIDS.ZS/countries/US-EU-1W?display=graph) who gather data on development around the world, seems to suggest the opposite. Now that's not to suggest that the research is wrong just that clearly there are other factors that are more influential particularly the prevalence of an STD in your country and the availability and use of contraception. 

Basically I don't see it as positives against negatives because the research cannot identify a positive well enough for any institution to recommend it nor are the negatives particularly negative at least to someone who expected nothing more.  I see it as tradition (in a secular sense) v the integrity of your body. Those are not two things you can compare so easily and you may care much less about your foreskin than the fact that its tradition and most other kids will be circumcised and might tease you etc. However I think most people are tragically misinformed about what the supposed positives and negatives of the procedures are and there are a lot of myths floating about. For that reason it seems likely that if parents looked into the whole issue more rather than unthinkingly following parenting procedure they would not go ahead with it concluding that there was no *need* for it. It seems therefore to be a pretty bad thing that parents could be compromising the integrity of their son's body, causing an irreversible change that he had no say in, and all for the wrong reasons. If after they were informed they went ahead anyway that's obviously fine but I won't blame the son if he feels a little hard done by when he's older.

Can't an article be written about Minitel that actually talks about Minitel instead of talking about whether it's ""the best"" or whatever?  You see, this is a cultural difference.

France does not give a shit if Minitel is better than the web - the French are all over the web.  Minitel was a service offered to the population as a whole, offered a wide array of services, and was useful and important for more than a decade.   In the same way that typewriters and answering machines have lost relevance so has Minitel - this does not mean every article about typewriters should be about their flaws in the keyboard age or how answering machines are someone not able to compete with voicemail (they might actually compete rather well..).

I've actually read about the Minitel and Teletext systems in the past so I actually already knew about these systems and they sound great, although the whole ""having to be a newspaper"" to provide content on there makes me think it could have been much more.

**INTRO:** La Ville Nue (Die Nackte Stadt) ist eine persönliche Kartographie von Lyon. Es handelt sich dabei nicht um eine typische Stadtkarte, stattdessen sind darauf Orte vermerkt, von denen man doch schon mal gehört hat, oder auch weniger bekannte Ecken...

**WER WIR SIND:**
*Por si LAS MOSCAS* ist ein Projekt von Felipe Faraggi und Catalina Sabbagh aus Lyon, das noch in den Kinderschuhen steckt.

Da die beiden Architekten und Designer aus Chile stammen, entspringt der Name *por si LAS MOSCAS* einer chilenischen Redewendung, die wörtlich übersetzt bedeutet: ""Im Falle von Mücken..."". Es ist der Gedanke der Vorbereitung und Vorbeugung, der diesem Sprichwort innewohnt, z.B. Nimm deinen Regenschirm mit, ""Im Falle von Mücken..."" [Not yet happy with the phrasing of the second sentence here, but I can't seem to find a better way atm]

Awww, nice. The allies needed Western Germany as a puffer zone to protect France against the Soviets. If this puffer zone was well-off or not was mostly irrelevant. We would have rebuilt, sooner or later, with those 19 billions or without.

&gt; You may think war reparations are stupid but when one country attackers another, particularly without provocation,

Heh, you really think wars are planned like this? WW1 was not a war of aggression from any side. Reparations were a way to continue hostilities after the armistice. Who sows wind ...

&gt;  Just because a few idiots are intellectually dishonest enough to throw the Nazi term around in the context of modern day Germans [...]

You would be surprised how common those idiots are. Try living in our shoes for a day or two. It's not only the net or media, either. 

&gt;  it is rather a hegemon of Europe that is unwilling to see itself in those terms.

Excuse me, but in my dictionary, hegemonial power is not an synonym for ""money press"". Sometimes, you have to act responsibly, and we have a very different view on what the responsible reaction to the situation is. This might be related to our view of responible behavior is hurting you a lot (just like our way hurt us, badly, ten years ago). Time will tell which of us is right.

You know, this is just the reverse Nazi card. ""If only the Germans would do this or that, they would be an accepted member of the international society again."" Frankly, we have heard this again, and again, and again. 

&gt; Germany, sadly, is afraid to be a leader

I don't think it's being afraid - we just don't see a benefit from it, for we are to pull the cart out of the dirthole, and when we are finished, the next round of everyone kicking us around begins. We have done this before in the 1970s, when the British needed our help, we have done this with the GDR (reunification was the single worst error of German post-war history), and now we are asked to help what effectually amounts to the whole Mediterranean.

&gt; The appellant [Assange]'s physical advances were initially welcomed but then it felt awkward since he was ""rough and impatient"" … They lay down in bed. AA was lying on her back and Assange was on top of her … AA felt that Assange wanted to insert his penis into her vagina directly, which she did not want since he was not wearing a condom … She did not articulate this. Instead she therefore tried to turn her hips and squeeze her legs together in order to avoid a penetration … AA tried several times to reach for a condom, which Assange had stopped her from doing by holding her arms and bending her legs open and trying to penetrate her with his penis without using a condom. AA says that she felt about to cry since she was held down and could not reach a condom and felt this could end badly.

Remember, this is his defence team, who have a vested interest in playing down any accusation made against him.

That being said, I'd recommand a check up with (based on my personal experience) :

- A dentist, at least to remove the tartar that accumulates on the teeth and can cause the gingiva to recede (leading to premature loss of teeth !). It's completely painless and it's quick. Do it. Usually, you will want to have an X-Ray as well to detect dental caries (which can lead to tremendous pain if not treated on time). My dentist (as most dentists) has the X-Ray machine in his office, conveniently saving you the trouble to do it in a specialized radiography practice.

- A dermatologist if you have skin issues. If you have moles, you wanna have yourself checked for malignant tumors. They can be treated easily (surgically removed) if detected early, otherwise... Bad things happen. A yearly checkup is usually enough.
A friend of mine was diagnosed with such a malignant tumor, hopefully they removed it at an early stage and he's fine ; he just needs to be extra careful (especially during summer months when you wear less cloth and are more exposed to the sun) because such tumors can come back.
Personnally, I also had a mole removed (and subsenquently analysed by a lab), turns out it was benign, but better safe than sorry. 

- Glasses once a year, you already do that, so that's good.

Aside from that, it can also be a good idea to have your hearing checked by an ENT specialist, especially if you work in noisy places, or go to a lot of night clubs and concerts. Ear damage is very hard to repair once it's done, but there are very good solutions to reduce noise if you are exposed to it regularly.
And if you feel long term persisting ""symptoms"" like fatigue, joint problems, stuff like that... Talk to your doctor about these. They can reveal a large panel of underlying (and potentially severe) conditions. Don't be paranoid, but don't be careless either. If there are problematic conditions in your family like heart, vision or other issues, have these checked at least once. 

You can also talk to him about quitting smoking, doing more exercise, changing your food habits... A good doctor can give you a lot of sound advice on how to improve your health habits and prevent problems, and refer you to other specialists if need be.
On the other hand, when you have a runny nose in winter, don't go whining to your doctor until you have waited a few days. Usually benign sickness will start, peak, and resolve themselves in a matter of days. Only consult if you really are in pain or if the symptom persists for more than 10-15 days.

The problems in Sweden pre-crisis was due to many reasons. Sweden's economic growth was slower than most other European countries. We kept labour intensive industries and competed by devaluating our currency and the following high inflation.

Then when Sweden try to move a away from  this quagmire, they loosened the currency control and pegged the currency, deregulated credit market etc etc. With the still quite high inflation the interest was more or less negative as well as badly regulated banks that lent to much. The crisis had been brewing for a long long time.

Being good in school is something that (at least in the lower grades, i.e. until you are going towards Abitur) is frowned upon by most kids in German schools. The stereotype is that children usually hate school, only want to play, and are happy with this kind of affair. You are a ""Streber"" if you break this stereotype, and -- unusually for your age -- place good marks over having fun. If you always make your homework, always listen to what the teacher says, and are genuinely interested in the stuff being taught at school, you are a Streber. And other kids will point out that fact and make fun of you.

Maybe that is the reason why there is no ""Streber culture"" (unlike nerd culture). Being a Streber means being an outcast, and so-one would wear that name with pride (even if one is proud of having good marks). Still, in Germany Streber are often nerds or geeks -- not necessarily the other way round, though.

That being said, as soon as one gets to the later stages of school (say, High-School equivalent), the term ""Streber"" seems to vanish more and more.

Because you pretty much describe the average European football fan who wants to see their team winning. National football is never solely about the sport, and it never was. The fan wants to see ""us"" winning against ""them"". Because the football players on the pitch represent the country and the culture of the country they are playing for. The players were raised in the country, got their education there and learned to play football. They represent the country and they are watched by hundreds of millions of people all over the world and there is a good chance that their most lasting impression about one country is how their footballer played the game and behaved themselves.

You may liked it better before 2006, when it was rather rare to show support for the German team with flags or other stuff. But this was not a normal demeanour. For a lot of people from other countries it was strange and a little frightening how the football team got supported. You may want back to the way it was, because you may think Germany should conduct itself in another way than other countries (maybe even thinking Germany is better than other countries because they don't behave in such a way. In a globalized world that is ""soo yesterday""). Or you want to change all of that accross Europe. Or you just want that the sport of football shouldn't occuopy such a unique spot in a lot of countries.

But the way it is now is that the average German football fan behaves like the average football fan from another European country. So Germany shouldn't be singled out. (So in that way the comic piece fits) If you want to moan about nationalistic tendencies, please do it about international football in general. Maybe advocate the idea that there shouldn't be a national anthem beeing played before the match for a start. i could get behind that idea. But your bitching about Germany is rather out of date, because I really do think we should get over WWII. Of course one should never forget the atrocities that were commited so the don't get repeated, but I think it's not that bad for the German people to get a more normal feeling for their own country, for their own nationality.

true,Nederbird,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;You do know that one looses about 10 % of the nerves and feeling? I think it's a big deal since I think that is something one should decide for themselves if they want. Would you remove 10 % of the nerves from a woman's clitoris?

Yeah, I do know that. On the other, the loss of those 10% percent does not adversely affect your penis. Urination and ejaculation works just fine and your penis is still quite sensitive. You still have 90% percent left. My point, since the penis will still functions just the way it should after removing the foreskin, it matters very little.

Female circumcision is a whole different thing, the two are not even comparable. The foreskin serves little to no purpose and can be removed without impairing the circumcised male in any considerable way. There is no comparable part on the female body. Furthermore, female circumcision causes a bunch of adverse side effects such as infections and the like, while the purpose of male circumcision is primarily preventive.

&gt;Do the penises is Europe strike you as very unhygenic? Do we have a lot more unhygenic diseases. I'd rather teach my children to wash themselves, everywhere, than be lazy and circumcise.

Yeah, a bit. The fact that there's a layer covering the glans proper just sounds to me as if it's a perfect breeding ground for God knows what between the two. To me, the benefits of removal outweigh the risks of keeping it.

&gt;What, are you saying that only things that can be consciensly remembered are traumatic. Also, as far as I understand, this is a lot of times done without anaestisia. A baby has as much, if not more feeling as an adult. Just because they can't express their pain in writing, etc, doesn't mean that they don't feel it. It would love to see that scientific report who claims that babies can't feel.

I was referring to psychological trauma that would have a debilitating effect on the person to the degree that it would impair ey in eir daily life, which circumcision does not cause if performed after birth. The use of anaesthesia varies from country to country and I would believe they use it here. There are also several variants available. I am in no way denying that they can feel pain, btw, and I'm strongly against any such procedure being done without using anaesthetics.

&gt;Absolutely no reason not to enforce a law. The same is said about female circumcision, child abuse, etc. We have to start somewhere. Also, since most children in the western wolrd have scheduled doctors appointments (I know they do in Sweden) it's an easy thing to check. A lot of people would stop if they knew that they would loose custody of their child and face a few years in jail.

So you would have my parents put in jail for something they did to me that caused me no harm, did not impair me in any way, has not denied me any opportunities that anybody else would have or hindered me from leading a happy and fulfilling life? While I can understand why you're opposing it, that's just an incredibly stupid thing to do. Just because parents circumcise their child doesn't mean they're horrible people who abuse their child, not by far. On the contrary, my parents have been loving and supporting throughout my life and I see absolutely no reason to resent them, even less to throw them in jail. They circumcised me because they believed it was for the best, which is also the reason that most other non-religious parents let their children be circumcised.

&gt;The point is, you have no right to make this decision for your child, just as you don't have the right to remove 10 % of the clitoris for a baby girl. If they want to do it when they are adults, fine, but honestly, how hard can it be not to mutilate children. At most they should provide some compensation, like paying for whatever method is necessary to restore the foreskin.

By that logic, it'd be criminal for parents to decide which school to put their child in or even which ice-cream to buy for them instead of letting them choose themselves. Parentage at all would be made nigh impossible. Parents, today as always before, are expected to make decision for their children all the time in line with that they see as being in the child's best interest. Moreover, male circumcision, if done properly, cannot even be considered mutilation, not in the proper sense at least, as the very definition of ""mutilation"" is: ""to physically harm as to *impair use*, notably by cutting off or otherwise disabling a vital part, such as a limb."" This is far from the purpose of circumcision and it's not even the effect of any circumcision properly done.

Admittedly, I can see the moral controversy regarding parents decision to remove the part of the foreskin, but personally I see don't see anything wrong with it as long as it's done at birth, inasmuch as I don't see anything wrong with my parents having decided to circumcise me at my birth. 

If you truly want to do something positive about this, like preventing harm, then what must be done is regulating the practice properly: setting up strict guidelines for how a circumcision is to be performed, so as to minimize damage; defining strict time limits wherein circumcision might be legally performed; regulating the practice so that only legitimately trained and certified doctors can perform the circumcision; making the use of anaesthetics compulsory during such an operation; informing parents about the pros and cons of circumcision as well as societal views and the possibilities that the child might resent them for it; and lastly, to fund research into what ways one might restore the foreskin should a circumcised person desire that.",0,1340969212,null,0,false,0,c577xb4,t3_vpmwf,t1_c577xb4,t1_c56q2ak,null,1429258280,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,vre-goron,GREE,Greece,"&gt; Awww, nice. The allies needed Western Germany as a puffer zone to protect France against the Soviets. If this puffer zone was well-off or not was mostly irrelevant. We would have rebuilt, sooner or later, with those 19 billions or without.

I don't think you understand the concept of hearts and minds when it comes to leadership. The Allies needed a prosperous Germany so that the German people would feel secure in their futures and less prone to aggression. It was well agreed to even during the war that the German people supported the aggression of the Nazis simply because it was their only perceived hope for a future...and NOT because all germans are simply war mongering supremicists. As for your buffer zone argument, that is true. But again, a buffer zone of poor disenfranchised people is not a buffer zone at all. Whereas a buffer zone of prosperous people is a true and cooperative buffer zone.

&gt; You would be surprised how common those idiots are. Try living in our shoes for a day or two. It's not only the net or media, either. 

I cannot claim to know what it is like to be German. But I do know many Germans (as I live and work in Germany). One thing I find to be true is that despite the idiotic Nazi claims made by morons, Germans tend to be harder on themselves about the issue. These are the shackles that I refer to. The fact of the matter is that all of Germany's efforts and struggles have been with a focus on Germany. Certainly they are commendable, but in the end, they serve only germany. If you were just a bit player on the world stage this would be a non-issue. However, you are not a bit player. You are certainly the engine of Europe and more than that, you are looked to as the example of Europe. To say that you don't benefit from it is actually an admission that you simply don't know how to benefit from it or are unwilling to step fully into the spotlight in order to benefit from it. There is a great deal to benefit from having a European periphery that is stable and prosperous and committed to a relationship with Germany...never mind the mere fact that they would continue to be a vital market for you. More importantly, it is entirely beneficial to have a periphery that is NOT imbittered toward you. They will seek partnership and stewards elsewhere and Germany could find itsel;f politically and economically isolated....all because of its short sightedness.

&gt; Excuse me, but in my dictionary, hegemonial power is not an synonym for ""money press"". Sometimes, you have to act responsibly, and we have a very different view on what the responsible reaction to the situation is. This might be related to our view of responible behavior is hurting you a lot (just like our way hurt us, badly, ten years ago). Time will tell which of us is right.

You are right and I never suggested that Germany's support should be without conditions. But when you ask a country to achieve in two years what you yourself took 10 to accomplish is rather preposterous. Not to mention that Germany underwent its own austerity during a time of relative global economic growth and was able to capitalize on that. We are asked to achieve these things at a time when the global economy is at a standstill. No one in my country thinks Germans are so stupid as to think that the two situations are identical and therefore the same medicine is required (at least not in the German government). Therefore, it is no wonder that those who are suffering might conclude that Germany wants Greece to feel pain more out of a sense of retribution and a threat to Spain and Italy rather than an achievement of some positive outcome. This is short sighted protectionism pure and simple. It is decidedly not leadership.

Actually, I am convinced that this is partially part of German politics, but certainly not what the average German wants. What we want is to be kept alone and not be burdened with the results others' irresponsibility.

The rape charges *are* contrived, but you need some background here to put it in context. In the early 00's the Swedish justice system was put under a lot of media scrutiny and critique because the laws regarding sexual crime were rather insufficient. It was practically impossible to legally prove rape, especially when it came to children and younger girls. So to appease media and the perceived public opinion the laws regarding sexual crime were widened a lot, with some rather unforseen consequences (it is now for example illegal to have consensual sex if both parties are minors, and 14 year olds having sex are routinely convicted of rape because of it). So while the charges may not sound like rape in the traditional sense (that's something I never imagined I'd type) they certainly would be under Swedish law as it is written.

In Sweden the prosecutor has the final say in all things related to the investigation and build up to a trial. The authorities are prohibited from getting involved by the constitution of this country. Therefore a prosecutor is free to file any kind of charges they want, no matter how ridiculous. No one can tell them to stop.

And that's why we are here today: an overzelous prosecutor jumping at the chance of trying an internationally famous person under an ill-thoughtout relatively new law in order to further her own career.

true,vre-goron,GREE,Greece,"&gt; Those are the same Allies, btw, who copied our ethnic cleansing, who were famous for their rape brigades in the East, who would let us starve to death in the winter of '47, and who specifically ordered their soldiers to not even talk to our civilians. That whole situation only changed when the Soviets broke away from the alliance and France and Britain started to understand Germany was the only thing standing between them and the Red Army. 

True...and I never implied that the actions of the allies were altruistic. They were all self serving. The difference is in the approach. History has taught us that you can gather more flies with honey...that doesn't imply that you are giving honey without gaining something in return. The allies realized this this and thus changed their approach. Of course it was for selfish reasons...who cares. It would have been just as easy for the US to occupy Germany outright just like the Soviets did and maintain that buffer zone...they chose a different approach and Germany is better for it. This is undeniable.

&gt; Well then, how do we benefit from giving free money, effectually the wealth we amassed by hard work and good trading, to black holes, who have a long history of deficits and no political will to ever get better? (Yes, Greece, I'm looking at you) If we burned those banknotes, at least we would save on heating in the winter...

First, you start by admitting that you are not giving money to Greece (aka black hole) when the vast majority of the money has gone to banks, including german banks. You are paying off the debts owed by greece to your banks so as to protect your economy from too-big-to-fail banks. Second, the money you are transfering to Greece is in the form of loans...therefore you are not giving anything away. It will have been given away only if Greece defaults. Otherwise, Greece will be spending the next countless decades paying you back. This is a vastly different story than ""we are giving all our money to profligate Greeks"". I understand that it sounds better to the population as opposed to ""we are saving our banks from their bad bets with a profligate country""....but it doesn't endear you to the world....because it is a lie by ommission. These things matter.

&gt; Ah, now we're at blackmail. Don't worry, in the end, disenchanted partners and stewards will return. Just don't trust that we will then be as cordial as we are now.

If stating the reality is considered by you to be blackmail, then you might consider the help of a psychologist because your paranoia is leaking all over the place.

&gt; So what would be acceptable conditions? What would you be ok with? Time is a rather critical factor, and we didn't have ten years either. We just transformed ten years ago.

From before the crises, Germany should have relenquished its mercentilist tendencies and acknowledged that trade in Europe under a single currency is a zero sum game. Germanys insistence on being a trade surplus country should have been tempered with a willingness to increase inflation and serve as a consumer market for its deficit nation counterparts. We are a bit late in the game and the markets have already tasted the blood in the water. How do you stop sharks during a feeding frenzy? Its hard to say. From the very beginning of the crises there should have been a willingness to stimulate growth in the periphery to balance off the necessary cuts in Greece. It would certainly have been cheaper in the long run. With such support you could likely have still kept the same time requirements for spending cuts. Now, I think the only hope for Europe is a clear roadmap to integration...which will be much harder for Merkel to sell at home because she's spent the last 4 years pitching the tired and innaccurate story of profligacy being the sole culprit of the crises. Greece is a lost cause...we will suffer regardless as we've crossed the rubicon and there is no solution...just a choice of which bullett might feel less painful.

&gt; What we want is to be kept alone and not be burdened with the results others' irresponsibility.

This statement reinforces my point that germany cannot cope psychologically with the burdens of leadership.

No, the ESM is, at least in principle, limited, and countries still issue their own bonds with their own interest rates. Access is tied to compliance with the stability pact and the European Commission's recommendations for reform.

&gt; While the new bank recapitalization mechanism seems a lot like printing.

That bank supervision and bailouts will be centralized is a good thing, to break the feedback loop of uncertainty about banks feeding uncertainty about the government's own debt in case of a bank bailout, which feeds uncertainty about its ability to provide such a bailout, which feeds uncertainty about the banks, which makes a bailout more likely, and so on. This still seems to lack centralized deposit guarantees to keep people from moving their savings into another country (and taxation, but banks don't pay a lot of taxes, anyway), but it's already giant step towards a banking union.  

That the ESM can buy government bonds is much better than giving huge amounts to banks at very low interest for them to buy government bonds at high interest with, which is printing -- not that this would always be a bad thing, somewhat higher inflation would be constructive anyway. The question remains whether those programs would be limited to the secondary market, there seems to be some disagreement about that and Finland and the Netherlands aren't happy.

&gt; Anyway, I think this is a good mid term solution, Europe needs to integrate a lot more but, realistically, that will take at least a few years.

Yeah, but while I like the step towards a banking union and the investment into growth (and that it will come from Brussels directly and not via the national governments), I had hoped for a strong statement of intent towards fiscal and political union. The more centralization of control and liability, the more need for a more direct democratic legitimization. We shouldn't risk to get stuck with ""good enough"" permanent measures.

&gt; I think Merkel actually did a good job this time, she previously got some controls in place and now is starting to show some flexibility like she should.

She needed those growth measures because without them the opposition wouldn't agree to the ESM.

* **(1)** The Eurozone rescue funds can be used to directly re-capitalize banks (under the direction of the ECB and a yet-to-be-created supervisor), and possibly even buy bonds of countries under market pressure (which would be a limited form of mutualizing the Eurozone debt, i.e. ""Eurobonds extra light"") and 

* **(2)** ""Virtuous"" countries, i.e. countries that fulfill the EU conditions imposed on public debt can gain access to the rescue funds without additional conditions, i.e. without ""Troika"" negotiations (that part is perhaps still up to some interpretation).

German media seems divided how to interpret the results, some claiming Merkel was ""defeated"" by Italy and Spain, other articles saying she made necessary concessions or only gave up positions that were untenable anyway; see for example Spiegel arguing both ways, [here, saying Merkel was defeated](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/merkel-makes-concessions-at-eu-summit-a-841663.html) vs. [here (in German) saying it was a necessary compromise](http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/kommentar-zu-merkels-rolle-auf-dem-eu-gipfel-a-841672.html). 

Important to consider is also that the result is most likely the outcome of a somewhat risky gamble by Monti, who threatened to block the growth pact, which in turn would have meant the German parliament wouldn't have signed the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which Merkel wants so badly. Bit of a paradox, at least superficially, because the whole growth pact is a concession of Germany to France. This lead the Economist to write ""Mr Monti declared himself satisfied, but caused considerable irritation to partners."" The Economist also [points out](http://www.economist.com/node/21557777) that Monti had to bring home some success because his domestic approval is sharply declining, which perhaps explains why he took this gamble.

One thing the article only mentions in passing is that the additions (as mentioned above) to the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) could lead to problems when the German parliament has to ratify it, but since objections would probably come from the conservatives, as long as Merkel is more or less stable domestically (which she is, for now), I don't expect it to fail that test.",0,1340980317,null,0,false,0,c579iv2,t3_vsmhl,t1_c579iv2,t3_vsmhl,null,1429259034,38,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,38

The only alternative would be if the Pirates would ""mature"" enough to become a viable potential coalition partner for the Social Democrats and the Greens to form a stable government, and while they're developing enormously quickly, they still have a far way to go and usually parties like to ""test"" coalitions on the state level first.  
A coalition with the Left won't happen, and they probably wouldn't drop our of parliament even if they went below the normal 5% threshold. Without going too deep into the details, Germany uses a system of mixed-member proportional representation, which means that you have two votes and half of the seats are reserved for candidates that get elected in the districts directly with the first votes, and the remaining seats get distributed so that the proportions in the end match that of the second vote for a party. Now, if a party wins at least three direct mandates in the districts, they enter the parliament in proportion to their share of the second vote, regardless of whether or not that share is above the 5% threshold. The Left will almost certainly win those necessary three mandates.

So, the way it looks now, we would end up with another ""grand coalition"" government in which the conservatives would be over-represented relative to the total votes for the more fractured left, and as the stronger partner they would provide the chancellor, i.e., Merkel.

That's why I'm not all too happy about the Pirates' quick success and would rather see them only slightly above those five percent.

This is much more relevant for Ireland. The [agreement](http://consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/131359.pdf) specifically talks about them: 

*""The Eurogroup will examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme. Similar cases will be treated equally.""*

Note the lack of ""Greece"" here, and the last sentence can easily be read as excluding Greece as close to explicitly as they could possibly do, because clearly, their causes and situation is not at all similar to those of Ireland and Spain, both of which went into the crisis with very low debt and even budget surpluses when their housing bubbles burst.

So far, Germany has been spared of the kind of populist anti-Europe parties that e.g., the Netherlands and Finland have to suffer. Merkel's coalition partner, the (neo-)Liberal FDP, has collapsed for reasons unrelated to the crisis. The opposition is much more ""flexible"", Merkel's conservatives are the most hardline among any plausible government parties.

However, see my other reply regarding possible constellations. The way things are now, Merkel would probably end up becoming chancellor again, as the head of a ""grand coalition"" with the Social Democrats. In such a case, I would expect their differences regarding those issues to be much more likely to lead to instability than to a decent compromise. A government crisis in Germany would be the last thing Europe needs right now, and that kind of power vacuum could get filled by populists, although I consider this unlikely (but not impossible).",0,1340982124,null,0,false,0,c579x1v,t3_vsc9h,t1_c579x1v,t1_c579hu3,null,1429259220,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Lobbying is how you advocate for change and is a basic part of participating in a democracy.  And simple majority opinions are not good enough for a lot of legislation.  Without pressure and creating awareness, the majority can't form an opinion on something.  If you were to put a vote for adding fluoride to drinking water, or to require certain building codes, the general public can't really assess the benefits and drawbacks.

Lobbyists serve a vital function for governments and that is pushing issues and raising awareness.  Sure it has a lot of potential to be abused, but it is the definition of advocacy.  The shitty lobbyists get all the press, like banks, right wing religious nuts (like these people), neocons etc.  

But there is a far greater lobbying society for conservation, consumer rights, LGBT rights, Anti Wasteful Spending, preservation of culture and arts, public safety, medical and space research and so much more.

I know what you're feeling, I also took the decision to move to Paris for an internship and successfully did so 4 days ago. From other threads you've surely seen people suggest different sites to find apartments. I found mine through parisattitude and I can definitely recommend them, they've been super helpful and professional. You do need to put together a bunch of documents for them but it's worth the pain. Also, there are quite a lot of fees to pay which I really struggled with as a student. You might get lucky finding an apartment through Craigslist (although a lot of scam and ads for expensive apartments there), or through appartager.fr, or through airbnb (seems quite popular lately). You might also want to check if there's a group like ""Americans in Paris"" or something on Facebook, I found a few nice offers through a group for people in my country.
  
I live in the 10th arrondissement and I expected it to be quite dead (Source: Google street view and not a lot of info about the district on the internetz) but it's the complete opposite! I'm literally 10min away (by foot) from the La Fayette shopping mall, another 10 from the St. Martin Canal which is where all the young locals go to drink and hang out. There are at least 3 metro and bus stops within 10 minute walking distance that take me pretty much anywhere in the city. So I recommend the 10th, but it's the only arrondissement I've ever lived in, so there :P I live in a tiny furbished studio, which is actually meant for a couple, and I have a nice little kitchenette and a bathroom - all's dandy. My salary at my job will not cover for my living expenses though, and I had to retort to asking money from my parents, which I would not have liked doing, but time was running out... Today at the bank, I heard that a girl was living in the same district in a 11m2 studio for 500€ a month, which is quite good value but 11m2 might be pushing the limits a little bit.
  
On another note, I've found the city to be quite unforgiving. The bureaucracy has been hellish, opening a bank account took me no less than 6 visits to the bank counselor and even today, when I finally thought it was all good, they called me back to ask for a copy of another contract. BLAH! Anyway, even through all this hellish process, the people at the bank were super helpful and took a lot of interest in me. Just when you think Paris is out to get you, it gives you a nice little pat on the back. At least that's what I've found so far. 
  
Getting a French phone number was easy. The people have been very polite and I've met a lot of nice people while doing completely random things (buying stuff at a hardware store, at the bank, in my local corner brasserie). This might be because I always speak french to them, so be sure to have at least a little bit of french knowledge before you come and only retort to english when everything else fails. No matter how hard your french may suck (completely guessing here, you might speak perfect french for all I know! :D) they honestly appreciate it.
  
All in all, I don't regret this decision (yet), but I like to think I knew what I was in for, as I've been to Paris as a tourist quite a few times and sometimes for extended periods. If possible, get familiar with the city before you move, or maybe you already have.  
  
I'd sure love to meet up when you do move here, I'll be here until the end of December. And also from what I've read, Reddit has had quite a few meet-ups and more are to come. You can PM me or ask me anything and I will answer to my best knowledge. I might not be able to give you as much insight about the city as native Parisians can but I can sure explain things about moving and getting your life started in this beautiful city :)  
  
**TL;DR** Move to Paris, it's awesome.

The french' take that to some other weird kind of level where most of their humor is more melachonic than lough-out-loud funny. 

As for the germans, as well as say Denmark, humor is used to in a intimate setting, almost as a form of politeness; their way of being humble. So, unless you actually go out and meet germans, you wouldn't know they were funny.

Per attività giornalistica deve intendersi la prestazione di lavoro intellettuale volta alla raccolta, al commento e all'elaborazione di notizie destinate a formare oggetto di comunicazione interpersonale attraverso gli organi di informazione. Il giornalista si pone pertanto come mediatore intellettuale tra il fatto e la diffusione della conoscenza di esso… differenziandosi la professione giornalistica da altre professioni intellettuali proprio in ragione di una tempestività di informazione diretta a sollecitare i cittadini a prendere conoscenza e coscienza di tematiche meritevoli, per la loro novità, della dovuta attenzione e considerazione.

Selbst wenn das stimmte (gebetsmühlenartig wiederholt, nie belegt - Dollarkurs und Exportquoten sprechen eher dagegen), dann bliebe immer noch der enorme Schaden für Irland, Spanien, Portugal, Zypern, und Griechenland.   

&gt; Der Euro hat es möglich gemacht, dass Deutschland mit seiner gigantischen Produktivität unter gleichzeitiger Kürzung von Sozialausgaben und Verzicht auf Lohnerhöhungen die anderen Wirtschaften Europas ausgehungert hat

""Aushungern?"" 

So ein Unfug - die Schwierigkeiten der PIIGS gehen auf übermäßige und unproduktive Ausgaben von staatlicher bzw. privater Seite zurück, siehe z.B. die spekulativen Immobilienblasen in Irland und Spanien.  Griechenland konnte sich dank des lange einheitlichen Zinsniveaus in der Eurozone mehr Kredite verschaffen, als finanziell tragbar waren.
Konsum und Spekulation vertragen sich wirklich nicht mit dem Vorwurf des Aushungerns.

Ein Land kann nur exportieren, was von anderen Ländern nachgefragt wird.  Niemand hat die PIIGS Länder gezwungen, von Deutschland zu kaufen - außer ironischerweise der Protektionismus der EU selber. Asien oder die USA hätten leicht einspringen können, gäbe es nicht die Handelsschranken des Binnenmarkts nach außen. 

Übrigens gab es diese ''gigantische Produktivität"" schon lange vor dem Euro, Deutschland ist seit den 70er-Jahren stets unter den fünf größten Volkswirtschaften der Welt. 

Die Eurozone wurden trotzt der Warnung vieler Fachleute, darunter zwei Nobelpreisträgern, aus politischen Gründen eingeführt, nicht ökonomischen. Ein optimaler Währungsraum ist die Eurozone heute ebenso wenig wie im Jahr 2000. Die damals vorhergesagten Probleme haben sich im vollem Umfang eingestellt.

While I continue to see nothing wrong with circumcision and definitely do not consider it mutilation, I realize that it is better to be intact and have a choice to remove it rather than being cut with no way back. For me, who has grown up with this and not knowing anything different till I was 7/8, circumcision has and continues to feel normal to me, it has been difficult to understand why this is a bad thing to do without consent. Ultimately, I do not wish to rob people of their right to a choice.

However, what hurts me about this debate, is how I feel I'm being victimized by people who speak of me like some tormented wretch for not having a body part I couldn't care less about, while at the same time vilifying my parents when I see them as having done nothing wrong. Where I want to get with this is, conclusively, that pre-adult circumcision should be banned, but since the injured party here would be the person circumcised, let them decide if they want their parents punished for what has been done to them or not when they reach adulthood, rather than having a third party stepping in and speaking for them without their explicit consent. I know I would not for any reason have wanted to see my parents taken away during my childhood, which I'm sure would have had a huge negative impact on my development as and individual, and I am sure many others feel as I do. For this reason, I am certain that it is better to let the injured party decide whether to take legal action against his parents or not when he is at an age to legally be able to do so and intelligent enough to make that decision.

In the end though, I now stand by banning pre-adult circumcisions.

You could be teased to be a streber if you did everything mommy asked from you (but it is more towards school / achievement kind of stuff).

Streber would be somebody not coming to a party but mentioning they would have to work for school instead.

A streber also usually is successful and thus may be resented by everybody else; when in fact it might just be some kind of dediction.

Many Streber *will not* be achievers later in life, because life is not about a curriculum with tests and grades, so in part it is shunning them / announcing to them that the kids already know that they will not be as successful in later life. (very unconciously but kids do seldom hear the storys about all good grades).

I think the 'not really liked' / popular is relevant in this as well.

geek nerd on the other side is about sharing / showing your stuff to be respected, not necessarily being the best / posing.

A streber is likely - and I assume that is where you are coming from - to be a nerd / geek because of his interests which may seem foreign to others. If they are into computers and tech, they are likely to be more happy with math (a favorite to dislike) and would understand the principle of the school system  and how to be successful in them.

true,balatik,null,null,"I'd have to say that Paris has a different layout than what you might be used to : it's very dense, you can cross the city by foot in less than 2 hours but you might not need to, because the subway system is quite reliable. If you're ever lost in Paris, find a bigger street, walk 5 minutes and you should find a metro station. Works everywhere. And in every metro station there's a detailed neighbourhood map with the street names... very practical :)

What I want to say is, as long as it's inside the limits of Paris, you'll be close to everywhere else. Each neighbourhood is its own little city center. As a general rule, the west side of town is very posh, and the east is poor/popular/cheap. Lots of students live on the Left Bank, but it's getting more and more posh and expensive... I'd suggest you look in the 10th, 11th and 12th districts, the 17th and 18th might not be bad, the 19th and 20th will be cheaper but you might not want to live there if you're a girl. Paris is relatively safe, but walking alone at 3 in the night is not advisable, esp. in the poorer districts :)

So yeah. To find a flat I'd suggest Appartager.com, which works well. Craigslist is not known or used by French people, but you might find interesting things? I really don't know though.

Renting a flat requires a lot of documentation. As the laws prohibit landlords to vacate flats easily from their occupants, the landlords and agencies prefer to have a lot of guarantees... It's the same for French people too. As for the bureaucracy, don't start me on this one... it can be reeeeaallly frustrating.

Have fun in Paris :)

I consider the active attempt to create, outline or dictate policy to governments through directly influencing the bureaucrats or politicians while going around official channels which have to exist for democratic reasons as a bad thing no matter the source or morality by said influence.

The statements made by his lawyer in court seem to be a narrative from the alleged victim's point of view: they talk about her inner feelings, for example, which Mr. Assange could not have known.  It therefore seems likely that his defense lawyer was crafting a narrative from certain facts that the court had accepted, such as AA's description of what happened, in a way that would minimize Assange's appearance of guilt while not contradicting testimony from AA that the court had accepted as a true, or probably true, description of what happened to her.

In other words, it is sometimes the job of a lawyer to argue in the alternative, meaning to essentially state, ""Even if what the alleged victim says is true, there is an explanation for my client's actions that is both consistent with most of the victim's story and not incriminating.""",0,1341004072,null,0,false,0,c57finp,t3_vr43m,t1_c57finp,t1_c576szg,null,1429261924,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"Well, for one, this will never happen. Why not? Well, there are several reasons.

The first reason is that most of Europe doesn't speak English at any reasonable level beyond ""yes, hello, goodbye, please"". Most languages (even smaller ones such as Danish) are large enough that people can get by just fine with only very rudimentary knowledge of English or any other foreign language. Those that are smaller (Flemish, Basque, etc.) are more impacted by their direct neighbors (Dutch, Spanish respectively) than by English, and so get by in that larger language instead of English. In short, there is just not a lot of reason for most people to use English in their day to day life.

The second reason is that language plays a big part in creating cultural identities. That's not only national identity, but also social/economic identity (""class""), cultural identity (consider various subcultures), ethnic identities (various urban sociolects), and even sexual identity. Many traditions and customs are embedded in the language, intertwined beyond easy separation, to such a degree that using English creates a distinct cultural context, in which the same things aren't available to people — that is: People would lose idioms, names for uncommon things, but also historical understanding and even eloquence. It is extremely rare to see well-written poetry in English, or any language for that matter, written by a non-native speaker.

Meanwhile, it has been observed that there exist many pidgin languages with English as one component. These typically exist in places where English is the ""lingua franca"", but where there isn't a lot of influence from actual native speakers of the language. This results in people communicating with whatever words they need to get the message across, which is perfectly rational and efficient. But it also means that these pidgin languages are virtually incomprehensible for native English speakers from outside the specific cultural context. In effect, this means that enforcing any ""lingua franca"" is pointless, because language evolves organically anyway into geographically or socially distinguished dialects that may or may not share significant vocabulary. You don't even need a full pidgin — I've often observed Danish colleagues communicate in pseudo-English, which was only coherent to Danish people in our specific profession. They thought they spoke perfect English, but in reality they just used English words to form sentences that only Danes would understand.",0,1341009197,null,0,false,0,c57gpjb,t3_vt29q,t1_c57gpjb,t1_c57fyg5,null,1429262485,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; To say this will never happen is silly. English is the most known language in Europe and I often see politicians in EU parliament using English even if they're from another country.

Well, that's irrelevant. The ruling class and academia generally speaks English almost everywhere, but the quality varies a lot, and there's a big difference between the ruling class and the populace. People generally don't speak English very well, if at all. There's a range of countries where people are pretty good at English (Scandinavia, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany to some (limited) extent, and of course the British Isles), but you would be surprised how basic the grasp on English that common people really is.

The worst part is: They sometimes don't realize it themselves. I've been overhearing some toe-curling conversations between Danes who thought they were communicating fluently in English, but who were in practice raping the language in ways that, and I will be the first to admit, my own mastery of English is not sufficient to describe.

&gt; In Ireland in the 1800s the main language was Irish. Language shift is not uncommon.

It happened for many reasons, the biggest being the complete dominance of the British on all fronts. These days, the UK is still a significant power in Europe, but not nearly as significant as others (Germany, France), and most importantly it wields zero dominance over any European country. The same thing happened in Norway, by the way, which was under Danish rule for 400 years, during which Danish was the language of the aristocracy and academia. I should mention that this period is also known in Norway as the ""Night of 400 Years"". I reckon the Irish have similar sentiments toward the British. In post-Danish Norway, strong political forces have worked to restore ""native"" Norwegian language, resulting in [nynorsk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nynorsk).

But I would say that language shifts are *extremely* uncommon. Every national non-Gaelic non-Uralic European language is a direct descendant of the specific dialect of Proto-Indo-European that was spoken at that particular geographical spot. Language shifts have mainly been driven by immigration, not by the same people suddenly switching languages, with the exception of under specific economic of military circumstances which aren't present in today's Europe (thankfully!).

&gt; The fact that they know these english words and have incorporated them into normal speaking means that english is already becoming the norm. Within generations you might see more and more english becoming common place until eventually a switch to english is made.

No, that will never happen. You missed the important part: What they're speaking isn't English. English-speakers would not comprehend it without already being able to speak the other languages that have influenced the context in which it takes place. English is about as influential as Latin used to be (at least in Danish), but you don't see Europeans speaking Latin. You *do*, however, see lots of loan words from Latin in most European languages, and that's the main contribution of English as well.

There is not anyone, anywhere in Europe, who is about to casually switch to English over the dinner table, save in courtesy for international guests. I think most non-native English speakers, myself included, would be extremely weirded out by that. There's a distinct awkwardness when everybody in the room speaks a particular language much more fluently than what is presently spoken, and that awkwardness arises from this simple fact: In your native language, you say what you want to.

Get a standard eurrail pass for 1 country. It will get you to Basel, Switzerland (can visit strasbourg, france from there) and some other bordering cities as well. You can also use the pass to get to Munich and then take a regional to Salzburg. 

Avoid for safety reasons? All cities have their spots to avoid but cannot say there is an entire city or region to avoid. 

Not in tour guides? Im most familiar with state of NRW, so can suggest taking the IC from Frankfurt to Bonn. Its the highest density of castles along a river in the world. Also, Bad Munstereifel is a very small village  that still has its original medieval wall. You can reach it by train. Finally the hike up or cable car up to Drachenfels is a great way to spend a Sunday. You can take a boat or train to Königswinter (where Drachenfels is located) from Bonn to hike or take the cable car. 

Edit: House Tacheles in Berin has squatting artists who sell their work from their galleries in the building. I picked up a poster-sized collage when I was there for under 20 Euro. Theres also a fun bar down the street. They had flames shooting above the dance floor when I was there. 

Youll be fine with English. May use French. Probably will not use Spanish.

In big cities, I would do both. Münster actually has a bike autobahn which is unique. It follows the path of the original city wall. Theres also a lake there that all the university students hang out and drink by at night.

Dont small talk e.g. ""Hey! How are you?"" when you are not genuinely interested in how their entire life is going at the moment. Dont walk in bike lanes, which are usually clearly marked and a different color. Arrive early especially for transportation. You will miss it if you're even a minute late.

So you're visiting Germany ay?

* The best travel option depends on how much and how far do you want to travel. For example, if you want to travel far and not every day, then carpooling is a good idea. If you want to travel often but within the state of Hessen (where Frankfurt is located), you can get a relevant train ticket. You can also combine the above options. So I would recommend you make a firm plan on how much time and money you are allocating to travel, and then your destinations and then what mode of transport to use.

* Im a foreigner myself. I dont know of any no-go places. Germany is awesome. Maybe avoid REALLY small villages at 2 am in the night?

* The tour guides mainly mention places which a lot of people go to and of course are significant in some way. There might be some hidden gems but i would suggest you go for the most talked about places in the limited amount of time you have. Allocate 2 days to Berlin and/or 2 days to Munich. (also, if you come near Cologne, drop a message).

* Nope. Most of the people speak/understand English. Some dont but wouldnt be a barrier.

* I would recommend public transport (i havent gone biking since ever) because it would take you less time to see all the things and you wouldnt get lost (or waste time finding where you are). Also, if you buy a ticket for Hessen for example, that goes for trains between the towns/cities and on local buses within those cities.

* You're Canadian. You cant do no wrong ;)
On a serious note, just be polite and open-minded with whatever you talk about and you're good. Germans have an immense amount of tolerance of the opposing opinion (in my experience).
