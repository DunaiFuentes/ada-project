true,Boon_Retsam,null,null,"I was living in Madrid this summer. I have a couple recommendations if you'd like!

If you want an authentic place to get some tapas (like, the real kind, where you get the food as you buy drinks), go to Blanca Paloma, on Calle Espiritu Santu in the Malasaña district (there's an enye in that word). Cheap, and you get a lot of good food as you order more drinks.

I didn't get to go to this club, but check out Gabana. I hear it's really cool and that there's some special events occasionally where all drinks are free until 1 AM or something like that. Be careful at Kapital (7-story club, very cool place)--on Thursday nights there is a ridiculous amount of tourists there due to Ladies' Night, and the creepy-predatory Spanish guys know to go there and it can get uncomfortable if you're not in a good group.

Check out the parks! Retiro and Casa de Campo are both really nice and really big, and there's a ridiculous amount of cool things to do in them. Boats on the lakes, rollerblading, capoeira, Egyptian temples, awesome statues.

Check out Reina Sophia museum and Museo del Prado. They've got some magnificent works in there.

If you want a decent place where all the students hang out and get cheap but good beer or tequila or whatever (1 euro shots, and each shot was like a shot and a half in reality!), there's a bar off one of the streets that branches off of Plaza del Sol that's plastered in a lot of Heineken advertisements. You'll meet a pretty cool blend of cultures there as well. I believe it's on Calle de Espoz y Mina, pretty close to an Irish pub. I'm trying to find it on Google Maps, but no luck so far, but you'll probably be able to find it if you ask anybody there, and it's a really great place that I fully recommend.

true,SteveMcQwark,CANA,Canada,"Well, it doesn't have to be like the US, where the constitution ensures a republican form of government. Beyond that, a parliamentary monarchy can also be described as a crowned republic. There's no real difference other than the title of the ceremonial leader.

But, it's still interesting to think about the implications. The concept of a monarch is that they are sovereign unto themselves and govern the people based on the constitutional restrictions imposed upon them. Having some of that sovereignty absorbed by a larger state can be seen as a significant decrease in stature. On the other hand, it can be seen as just another variety of constitutional restriction.

One case that's particularly interesting is the British monarch. The Crown is already supranational in nature, governed by the constitutions of 16 independent countries. In a sense, then, two supranational sovereignties would be operating in Britain in a sort of cohabitation.

It is also interesting to compare such a European situation to Canada and Australia, two federal monarchies. Canada is, in a sense, an inverse of the situation you are describing: the monarch can make laws at the federal level, but cannot make laws at the provincial level. In that sense, the sovereignty of the monarch is encroached upon by the sovereignty of other states (the provinces). Of course, the Queen indirectly appoints the chief executives of the provinces, so the provinces are also considered to be monarchies under the Queen, despite the constraints on her direct authority within them.

In Australia, the states are directly under the Queen just as the Commonwealth (of Australia) is, so there the sovereignty of the Queen of a state is encroached upon by the sovereignty of a larger state. Of course, since both are monarchies, and indeed are under the same monarch, it's not quite the same either.

All in all, the idea of the ceremonial opulence, if you will, of a monarch existing at a lower level, where the higher level state is a utilitarian republic strikes a bit of a discord. However, it sort of speaks to the nature of Europe: all the flash and passion exists at the national level, while the supranation is utilitarian in nature.

true,Jonisaurus,null,null,"- ""Don't talk about the war"" is false, just don't talk about it with strangers, it's not a taboo and there's no need to be super careful to avoid the topic or anything...

- If you're male: in private houses/flats it's considered bad manners to pee while standing. No, this is not a joke. You sit down and avoid any pee splashing. Ofc in public toilets everyone stands (urinals...)

- Learn some very basic German, the little effort will be appreciated.

- Cheek kissing is only done with close or semi-close friends in Germany, and never with people you have a more professional relationship with. Then you shake hands, even with women. Also: never cheek kiss with a male if you are male.

- Punctuality is appreciated, but the German stereotype really isn't all that true. I've lived in other European countries and Germans aren't the punctuality-nazis people make them out to be.

- Supermarket cashiers and other people that interact with you publicly are notoriously unfriendly. This clishé is true, you will learn to ignore it and go mental with the occasional friendly cashier.

- Not many shops are open 24/7, not even gas stations. Everything except restaurants closes on Sunday. Only in big cities do shops have open normally on Saturday (which is 20:00-22:00 for supermarkets, and 20:00 for most shops).

- Ah yeah, the time. 24 hour clock is used everywhere, in the German language even orally. 20:00 = 8 pm, 22:00 = 10 pm, 8:00 = 8 am etc. In German you can use both in spoken language. ""Zwanzig Uhr"" is ""twenty o'clock"" (8 pm), ""Acht Uhr abends"" is ""eight o'clock in the evening"" (8 pm) and ""Acht Uhr morgens"" is ""eight o'clock in the morning"" (8 am).

- Anti-American sentiments (if you're American) exist, but a whole big lot of people are also very pro-American, freedom from Nazism and things like the Berlin Airlift and the Marshall Plan have pushed society's image of America into a very positive direction. Bush destroyed some of that image. Some negative stereotypes you'll encounter: fat, dumb, without culture. On average I'd say, Americans are well-liked.

- Religion is pretty weak in society. Other than concerning traditions,you won't hear people talk about it. There are two churches: a unified Protestant church and the Catholic church. Catholics are widely considered the most conservative but compared to a lot of American Christians they are still bastions of progressive ideology.

- If you're going to school in Germany and if you're American: there is nothing like the pledge of allegiance or anything similar in Europe. People don't pray publicly, people don't swear on their loyalty and patriotism in general is very limited.

- German friendships and social interactions are different to other cultures, this is an important point. Germans will often be very direct, very honest and not sugar-coating. Germans have different words for friendships: a ""Bekannter"" is just a loose friend with no big attachment, a ""Kumpel"" is like a male friend you go out drinking with and a ""Freund"" is a real friend. A ""Freundschaft"" is a much deeper/stronger bond than just your average American friendship, because it's much less used, only for your ""real"" friends.
If you *are* friends with a German, they will often be very very open and honest and truthful. I've once heard it described like this:

""Americans have a soft shell and a hard core"" = it's much harder to reach the real core than to become friends initially.

""Germans have a hard shell and a soft core"" = that means once you've formed a friendship, it's easier to really form a deep bond.",0,1348380740,null,0,1348381084,0,c6c4u8x,t3_10bh49,t1_c6c4u8x,t3_10bh49,null,1429967739,27,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,27

I'm sorry but your example is wrong. There were no kingdoms in the HRE. The only way to become king was to have a kingdom outside of the HRE. Prussia did this. The Hohenzollern family ruled over the area around what today is Berlin. They could never be kings of Brandenburg, only margrave. To become kings, they had to inherit the ducal state of Prussia outside of the HRE which later became the Kingdom of Prussia.

The same goes for other kingdoms ""inside"" the HRE. They ruled mostly as dukes within the HRE, but they were kings somewhere outside of it.

A better example would be the German Empire (1871-1918):

The emperor received his power not from God, but from the rulers of the different states. These rulers included several kings. Their only contribution was the founding ""election"" of the Prussian king as Emperor. They remained kings within the Empire, but they were without power after the foundation.

It depends on how you define ""best"". By that logic everybody could separate from any country from any time, which will lead to a state of eternal ethnic tensions, since people relocate, have different birth rates, etc, so somebody will *always* try to change borders. If in 30 years Albanians gain a significant number in South Serbia, or Macedonia, or Greece or whatever, do then then also again get the right to ""split""? And 30 yrs later again? And again? This would be an neverending story.

Plan B would be internationally freezing borders forever and voluntarily ethnic cleansing. If you dont like it in Serbia, get the fuck out. This perfectly worked for Serbs in Croatia. They didnt like Croatia, and then got the fuck out, problem solved. If Muslims dont like it in Sweden, they move the fuck out, they dont get to proclaim an independent Malmö caliphate, etc. Somehow only Albanians get the right to keep a part of every foreign country in which they happen to have a local majority. They're trying the same shit in Macedonia _right fucking now_.

You dont simply give every dissatisfied (or nationalistic) group of people the right to unilaterally take a part of the country they happen to live in. Thats a neverending conflict nightmare straight from the middle ages. Basically *every* separatist movement in Europe right now considers Kosovo as the legal precedent to build their own separatism on.

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

Ich lese immer Ihre Internet Seite, weil ich mich für die Psychologie -besondres Psychologie der Kinder- interessiere. In Ihre Seite habe ich den Artikel gelesen, der ""Sollen Zweijährige schon fernsehen"" heißt. Deshalb würde ich ihn kommentieren.

Eigentlich habe ich so viel über dieses umstrittenes Thema gelesen. Einige sagen dass Fernsehen nützlich ist. Andere haben andere Meinung. Deshalb bin ich durcheinander. ""Was würde ich machen, als meine Kinder 2 Jahre alt wären? Würde ich Sie fernsehen lassen?"". Diese Frage kommt in jeden Mutterskopf. 
Ich habe nie erfahren ein Vatter zu sein, aber als ich gesagt habe, habe ich ein großes Interesse an diese Thema, weil Kinderspsychologie mir gefällt.

Ich finde dass das Fernsehen ganz wichtig ist. Wenn das Kind fernsieht, lernt es nicht nur neue Wörter, sondern sein Horizon erweitert wird. D.H er lernt Z.B was Erfolg, Herausfordenung und Happy Ending sind.

Das Fernsehen spielt allerdings eine große Rolle, damit das Kind flüßig mit Sprechen wird, aber Fernsehen allein ist nicht ausreichend. Das Kind braucht die Hilfe Ihrer Eltern. Das Fernsehenist ist nämlich nur ein Gerät zu wahrnehmde. Die Eltern sollen nach dem Cartoon mit Ihrem Kind sprechen über was er davon gelernt hat. Ich meine dass das Kind aktiv mit Sprechen sein muss. 

Außerdem sollen die Eltern ihre Kinder keine brutale Szene schauen lassen, denn das macht die Kinder sehr aggressiv und sie streiten sich viel mit Ihren Freunden. Deswegen finde ich dass die Altersbegrenzung sehr  wichtig ist. Zudem wenn die Kinder zu viel Zeit von dem Fernsehen verbringen, verhindert das Ihr Psychichwachstum.

Zusammenfaseend würde ich sagen dass das Fernsehen ein zweischneidiges Schwert ist. Die Kinder lassen sich sprechen, jedoch sie brauchen die Hilfe Ihrer Eltern.

~~What are his hidden motives, then?~~

Or, to be less combative , I'm actually not clear what hidden motives you're attributing to him. Because he distinctly says that he is speaking in favour of the nation state.

Edit: To address the other part of your post:

&gt; He rants away about the destruction of democracy but not once does he try to explain exactly how that happens apart from some vague ""those clowns in Brussels are stealing it from us"".

This also strikes me as being a misrepresentation. The only reference to Brussels-based politicians is to Barroso, and Klaus' comments are nothing like ""those clowns in Brussels are stealing it from us"", but rather *""This is the first time [Barroso] has acknowledged the real ambitions of today's protagonists of a further deepening of European integration. Until today, people, like Mr Barroso, held these ambitions in secret from the European public""*. Which is fair, and probably true.

He then criticizes British conservative politicians as being 'two-faced', that is, more Eurosceptic when speaking to the British public than they are at European summits, which is fair, and also probably true. And then, he criticizes Italian politicians as abdicating their responsibility to sort out their country. It seems to me pretty inarguable that part of the motivation of these politicians is that they think their country will be better run if they pass power upwards, to Europe. So, again, a fair comment.

Ich lese ~~immer~~ Ihre **Internetseite** *regelmäßig*, weil ich mich für die Psychologie - **besonders Kinderpsychologie** - interessiere. **Auf Ihrer** Seite habe ich den Artikel gelesen, der ""Sollen Zweijährige schon fernsehen"" heißt. **Diesen würde ich gern** kommentieren.

~~Eigentlich habe ich so~~ *Ich habe schon* viel über dieses umstrittene~~s~~ Thema gelesen. Einige sagen**,** dass Fernsehen nützlich ist**, andere** *sind der gegenteiligen* Meinung. Deshalb bin ich durcheinander. (It sounds a bit strange and lacks content, but I'm doing only a language correction here) Was ich machen *würde*, **wenn ich zweijährige Kinder hätte**? Würde ich Sie fernsehen lassen? (I'd spare the quotes and use indirect speech here) Diese Frage **stellt sich jede Mutter** (or better: *jedes Elternteil*). Ich habe *nie eigene Kinder gehabt* (or, if you want to emphasize experience, ""habe nie erfahren, wie es ist, eigene Kinder zu haben"") aber ~~als~~ **wie** ich gesagt habe, habe ich ein großes Interesse an **diesem** Thema, weil Kinderspsychologie mir gefällt.

Ich finde**,** dass das Fernsehen ganz wichtig ist. Wenn das Kind fernsieht, lernt es nicht nur neue Wörter, sondern sein Horizon**t** *wird erweitert*. **D.d. es** (children are not necessarily male) lernt **z.B.** was Erfolg, *Herausforderung* und *Happy Ending* (that's something very specific, I wouldn't mention that here. But as I said, I'm only doing language) sind.

Das Fernsehen spielt ~~allerdings~~ *auch* eine große Rolle, damit das Kind **die Sprache flüssig lernt,** aber Fernsehen allein ist nicht ausreichend. Das Kind braucht die Hilfe ~~Ihrer~~ seiner Eltern (I'll say something to that at the end). Das Fernsehen ist ist nämlich nur ein Gerät ~~zu wahrnehmde~~zum Wahrnehmen. (Sounds strange. I'd say ""ein Gerät, mit dem man nur passiv konsumieren kann"" or something the like) Die Eltern sollen nach dem ~~Cartoon~~ *Fernsehen* mit Ihrem Kind **darüber sprechen, was es** davon gelernt hat. Ich *meine, dass das Kind aktiv sprechen* muss. (Uhm? Content?)

Außerdem sollen die Eltern ihre Kinder keine **brutalen Szenen** (Plural) schauen lassen, denn das macht die Kinder sehr aggressiv und sie streiten sich viel mit Ihren Freunden. Deswegen finde ich**,** dass die Altersbegrenzung sehr wichtig ist. Zudem **wird die geistige Entwicklung behindert,** wenn die Kinder zu viel Zeit von dem Fernsehen verbringen. ~~verhindert das Ihr Psychichwachstum~~ (Wow. That's not a word:-)

*Zusammenfassend* würde ich sagen**,** dass das Fernsehen ein zweischneidiges Schwert ist. Die Kinder ~~lassen sich sprechen~~ ('the children let them speak?' makes no sense, does it? Better: ""Die Kinder lernen viel dadurch""), jedoch sie brauchen die Hilfe Ihrer Eltern.

All cancers mortality rates, 2009

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; We can all have a satisfactory level of medical care without compromising anything. Instead of cutting deals on a national level, we can negotiate with pharmaceutical and medical supplies companies on a European level. The savings could be used to fund programs in less fortunate countries.

Pharmaceutical companies set the price of their drugs how they want it. If you want the latest and greatest drug for cancer therapy, then you need to pay the price the company wants. In case of generic medicine and medical technology, you could achieve some savings, but those savings and more can easily be eaten by added European bureaucracy purchase organization. At the end of the day, the more you have money, the more you buy those latest and greatest drugs and medical technology.

Not to mention, what is adequate level of medical care? Who defines it?

&gt; Regarding my initial remark, the states that received loans in exchange for austerity programs found themselves in a worse position. Should their creditors demand more cuts that affect the most vulnerable, although these tactics are worthless -- just see the recession figures -- and have a cost in human lives? My answer is no.

The other option that these countries had was to default and not get funding from the market. Actually that is still an option. The only thing that has changed is that instead of market actors being main creditors, other EU countries and the ECB have largely replaced them.

There is no alternative option where there would be loads of free money flowing into these countries. The reality is that there is less money and the only question is how the burden of cuts is going to be divided.",0,1348413945,null,0,false,0,c6c8hlm,t3_10c3f7,t1_c6c8hlm,t1_c6c8asv,null,1429969495,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

For some types of cancer, the pharmaceutical companies will sell you a treatment for 70000 euro. For the patients, there are two choices: you take the treatment, you have 80% chances of recovery, you don't take it, you die within a year, virtually no exceptions. 

Of course the sum paid has nothing to do with their costs, which are (excluding research) probably less than 100 euro, but with the maximum amount that Western European governments and American insurance companies are willing to pay to save one life.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; In the United States, the most recent data from 2003[2] suggest that about 94 billion dollars were provided for biomedical research in the United States. The National Institutes of Health and pharmaceutical companies collectively contribute 26.4 billion dollars and 27.0 billion dollars, respectively, which constitute 28% and 29% of the total, respectively. Other significant contributors include biotechnology companies (17.9 billion dollars, 19% of total), medical device companies (9.2 billion dollars, 10% of total), other federal sources, and state and local governments. Foundations and charities, led by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, contributed about 3% of the funding. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research)

The money that the US government spend went mainly to basic research, that only produces interesting results, to create actual functioning medical products out of those, you need lots of funding and research that is done by pharmaceutical companies. Not to mention that in the case of for example USA and UK, both of these countries have quite a good concentration of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that gives the state incentive to fund basic research. If there wouldn't be these companies to begin with, both governments would probably fund other venues more that have more benefits to add for the local economy and state coffers.

Again, if you remove patent protection, you will remove quite good portion of motivation for private and public organizations to fund new research.",0,1348418204,null,0,false,0,c6c9czk,t3_10c3f7,t1_c6c9czk,t1_c6c91qc,null,1429969911,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Yes, I agree that it's clear that a centralized Europe could well be just as democratic in the future. Although to be fair, Klaus says that democracy is necessarily tied to a nation-state, presumably because that equates to a community with a shared, relatively homogenous political culture. A centralized European state would not be a nation state, but rather a loosely formed federation. It might well be that this would coalesce in time towards a nation-state, as has occurred in America, but it would certainly take at least a generation for this to occur. And in the meantime, democratic supervision of government would be lessened.

I'm playing devil's advocate, and this isn't necessarily my opinion, but now that I consider it, there are no democratic units which have the same or greater sense of cultural diversity as you would find within the EU.

I am an occasional pipe smoker; I like a heavy latakia, *but* having taken up smoking gradually and with care, I never ended up dependent on it -- depending on mood, I smoke several pipes a day, or not a single one for several weeks or even months. Therefore, I am not really attached to my habit. Furthermore, latakia is a really tough tobacco; when I start puffing, my smoke will easily fill a very small bar and while it sure smells nice to me, it would probably choke a small animal to death.

What has proven to be the key to my cohabitation with non-smokers have been the simple acts of asking for approval if I have doubts, and stop smoking if I'm asked (politely). If I'm in a very small place and I seem to be the only smoker, I just ask if it's ok to smoke -- even if there's a big ""smoking allowed"" sign like in a bar. Your average non-smoker may not mind that I'm trying to have a good time; a non-smoker who has asthma *might* mind, and with good reason. If someone asks politely (or appears to be bothered by my smoking), I ask them to bear with me until I finish the bowl so that I don't have to throw away half of the tobacco in it, and then simply stop smoking. Sure, if they don't ask politely I just tell them to fuck off and mind their own business, but there's no reason not to be civil with someone who is.

At the end of the day, it just comes to the fact that there's no reason why one side's well-being has to take priority over the other. My well-being requires that I smoke without much hassle, but it doesn't necessarily require that I smoke at the expense of others' well-being. If I *really* want to smoke, I can pick a place where smoking is allowed and I don't bother anyone. If I *really* don't want to be bothered by smoking, I can pick a place where where smoking is not allowed -- in the 21st century there are probably a lot of both.

&gt; This also strikes me as being a misrepresentation. The only reference to Brussels-based politicians is to Barroso

You're right on this one, I was attributing to him something I haven't observed him say, and that was wrong. But for the rest..

If we forget for a moment the hyperbolic nature of his comments, he fails to connect his argument that further federalization is damaging to our democracy with any sort of explanation other than a parenthesized matter-of-fact statement that democratic mechanisms ""are inseparable from the existence of the nation state"", which needs to be argued for separately. Now, he may have made his argument for why he thinks that is true elsewhere, but he can't treat it as an objective fact to support his other arguments when it is not.

I'm inclined to agree with him that state-level politicians are two-faced, incompetent and cowardly, but that's not what he's arguing against. In fact, it's irrelevant. Just like it's irrelevant how much power a federal state would have. Federalization is neither more or less democratic. And it's not the part of his opinion I was arguing against. It was the way he presents a false dichotomy between federalization and democracy and a false dependency on the nation-state for democracy.

As for his ""hidden motives"", I never said he hides them. He camouflages them with arguments for democracy, because who doesn't like democracy, right? This of course precludes that he isn't doing this intentionally and actually believes democracy is at risk from federalization or the weakening of the nation-state, but it doesn't hold up to objective investigation. It may also be that his views have been mangled by Mr. Waterfield, who - like most political bloggers and columnists - processes everything into fodder for his readers who have already formed their opinions and are not interested in reading anything challenging that (which is, as you mention, pretty much like how Reddit works).",0,1348423549,null,0,false,0,c6caln0,t3_10c554,t1_c6caln0,t1_c6c7c3w,null,1429970489,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

You can get something like that in some places: look up Eolo at [NGI](http://www.ngi.it). I have no experience with that, but I hear it's pretty good.

If you mean an ADSL connection with a wireless access point then pretty much any ADSL operator will do. Generally all operators will cover all options ranging from giving you no device so you can use yours, to giving you an all-in-one ADSL router with wireless features.

All ADSL lines are generally unlimited. *Some* operators might impose throttling if you really abuse p2p downloads, but I think it's a fairly rare occurrence.

As far as performances go, generally depends a lot on your specific city. Fastweb is generally good, albeit a bit more expensive, and you won't have a public IP unless you pay an extra for it, so p2p downloads might suffer; they're the only ones that -in some cities- give you a fiber connection. Telecom Italia is the default for many people; their call center is a nightmare and they'll often require you to use their customized routers that will give you no option for any advanced configuration you might want to do.

Tiscali tends to be a bit cheaper, but it also tends to suck a lot in some places: they often oversell their bandwidth, so at peak times it will be more interesting to watch paint dry.

Personally I've been using NGI (which I linked above) for years and I can't really complain.

true,donkey_lz,null,null,"&gt; Then there are those pesky facts which IMO take us outside of the realm of politeness: In the Canton Ticino, after the ban of smoking in public places the number of heart attacks dropped by 20%. In the Canton Graubünden a similar rate of 22% has been found. Resporitary illnesses have gone down 19% since the introduction of a similar ban in the Canton of Geneva

First, even if this would indicate an actual correlation, it is not a compelling argument for forcing bans on smoking in all public places. Restaurant or bar owners who are concerned about smoking are free to ban smoking in their places at this moment, and if they do not ban it, their customers are free to leave. It's not like, without state intervention, non-smokers will be tied to their chairs and hoardes of smokers will gather and puff around them.

There are several restaurants, coffee houses and fast-foods around my house where smoking is not allowed, or is allowed only outside; unsurprisingly though, they're pretty empty, but since no one is forcing people to go to places where smoking is not banned, the logical inference is that clients -- some of which are non smoking -- simply decide not to go to them. And with anti-smoking campaigns as numerous and as aggresive as they are, it's hardly an uninformed choice, really.

As for the findings, I'm looking at these two articles:

http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss_news/Swiss_stub_out_their_cigarettes_almost.html?cid=8787838

http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/top_news/index/Smoking_ban_linked_to_drop_in_heart_attacks.html?cid=8038358

and quite frankly, I'm rather skeptical about them. First of all, the effects of smoking accumulate and, past a certain point, don't go away if you suddenly stop. Someone who has had a history of alcohol and tobacco abuse and whose heart has suffered considerable damage won't spring up with a healthy heart if he starts smoking only at home -- and cigars are made of tobacco, not uranium, so as to kill passive smokers within months of exposure. So there should be no difference for smokers who only smoke at home, and the effects should take longer to manifest in passive smokers, unless people have been smoking cyanide for the last decades.

Second, neither article breaks down the number of reported cases by incidence and prevalence. People don't just develop a CVD in six months and die -- they are far slower in most cases, with many people having (and taking medication) for CVDs for years or decades. As a consequence the banning of public smoking is only a late entry in the medical history of the patients. I'm not an expert in medicine or statistics, but anyone who has taken at least a decent systems theory course knows that local events are not representative of systems with high time constants, not even when they're linear. It's particularly disheartening that the articles only make reference to a single issue -- the rate of accute myocardial infarctions -- without taking into account how many of them occured in stages where late enough that the tobacco ban had little or no effect. I couldn't find the relevant European statistics quickly enough, but a quick Googling turned up this one for the US: http://oaspub.epa.gov/eims/eims.roereport.getfile?p_download_id=12906 . A variation of nearly 10% in prevalence of CVDs can easily translate in a 20-30% variation of *a single* (and usually final) symptom, even without any influence from external factors.

J'ai du mal à voir en quoi une décision qui compte étendre le droit de vote (ne serait-ce que pour les municipales) à des résidents qui ne sont pas citoyens français n'affecterait pas la vie quotidienne des français. Pour commencer déjà ça affectera la vie, au niveau municipal, de tous les français. 

En effet, imaginons que dans une ville il y ait 40% d'étrangers d'une certaine communauté (quelle qu'elle soit) et que tous ces étrangers aient soudain un poids électoral au niveau local, est-ce vraiment déraisonnable de penser que cela risque d'affecter considérablement la vie des français de cette ville?

So? if anything, its the height of absurdity to finance an organization promoting secularism via a mechanism that privileges world-view positions to other ngos - hence undermining its own platform of complete state neutrality and non-action on matters of personal beliefs. Its completely antithetical to the nature of the position .

Its merely a fig leaf on a fundamentally unjust mechanism, so it doesn't appear to be discriminatory.

Though ofc it remains so, since disbelieving certain claims hardly creates a particularly common world-view. 

Certainly less common than what say ppl wishing to donate to a concrete cause would have (for example, protection of the environment). Yet they don't get such privileges.

So naturally, ppl merely lacking certain beliefs hardly have a cause to give money to any strain of world-view organizations, since not buying a claim doesn't commit one to any particular view.

Having experienced both CET and UTC for at least a year and under the same longitude, I must say that this hour doesn't really make a huge difference in your day once you're used to it.

Research is very, very expensive. For example, a new anti-biotic costs on average between 500,000,000 and a billion USD to develop. Development times are long, so between 8 and 12 years for antibiotics.

That's not really what I'm saying. It's not that they're concerned necessarily about democracy in the whole of Europe, but that they're concerned about democracy in their own country. Which is of course their prerogative. Your first paragraph is really just an (interesting) explanation of why this is the case. 

I also think it's a bit uncharitable to say that they dislike countries simply because they don't wish to be part of a supranational federation with them. Just because I wouldn't want Britain to be part of America or India, it doesn't mean I dislike those countries, but rather that I realize that it wouldn't be practical. Albeit I'd be happy to join organizations which bound us to similar goals, for instance to obey international law, or to maintain free trade. The links between Britain and Europe are obviously strong, so I'd go much further, for instance open borders for movement of people, having joint investment funds, centralizing large sections of economic policy that allow the group to act as an economic bloc, and encouraging cooperation and exchange at all levels of society. I would not, however, join a European nation state, run from Brussels, and neither would most people on this board. They have some intermediate stage of integration in mind. And the people who support those intermediate stages, who would prefer decentralized power within a European federal state, they don't support that policy because they dislike other European. If Scottish independence happens, I hope it won't be because Scottish people dislike English or Welsh people, or that some long-term emnity must arise. People who support greater decentralization of power within France don't do so because they dislike other French people. You see how quickly this sort of rhetoric becomes absurd.

En France, le regroupement familial a été institutionnalisé par Valéry Giscard d'Estaing en 1976, avec le soutien/lobbying des grands patrons comme Martin Bouygues, qui comme chacun le sait étaient de grands utilisateurs de main d'œuvre étrangère à pas cher sur leurs chantiers.

Auparavant, les travailleurs étrangers qui venaient en France venaient dans le cadre d'un contrat de travail, et repartaient à son terme.

Et pour la sélection, c'est une blague ? Parce que personnellement, je vois surtout des chômeurs sans aucune qualification obtenir la nationalité. Je rigole même d'en voir certains faire valoir leurs diplômes bidons obtenus à l'étranger (moyennant quelques billets) pour obtenir les équivalences en France.

Après, peut-être que l'État Français pousse le vice de la folie suicidaire jusqu'à se montrer rigoureusement sélectif uniquement avec les candidats qualifiés, ça ne m'étonnerait même plus…

Et je ne parle même pas des filiales de mariage en blanc. Dans ma région, un industriel tenait ouvertement en marge de ses activités professionnelles un catalogue des jeunes femmes, essentiellement des femmes russes dans son cas (à l'époque où ça allait mal) avec book photos, CV, pedigree, etc. Lui-même s'était fait venir une petite jeunette qu'il avait épousé, et qui faisait office d'interprète.

Également, le seul fait de naître sur le territoire Français fait que la personne obtiendra automatiquement la nationalité française à sa majorité si elle la réclame, et ça donne le droit de regroupement familial à ses parents étrangers qui sont venus accoucher en France, ça leur ouvre également des droits aux aides de la CAF, à un logement ainsi qu'au minimum retraite (qu'ils peuvent toucher sans jamais avoir travaillé), dont le montant est supérieur à la retraite d'un smicard qui s'est usé plus de 40 ans.",0,1348441086,null,0,1348487835,0,c6cf0ku,t3_10bdym,t1_c6cf0ku,t1_c6ceovv,null,1429972636,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Coming from you, who often state that economic freedom is bad, I'll take that with a grain of salt.

Adsl goes over a phone line. Hence wired. If you don't have a phone line then it is complicated but it is the best connection commonly available in Italy. If you are not a tech person you don't really care about provider. Just avoid Telecom italia (Alice). Their customer service is the worst.
As the wireless goes, there is mobile internet (chiavetta) which you can get with a 10gb/m for 20-30 euros/m but it sucks and the 10 usually results in ~8. Then it is also 10 both ways what many don't understand.
then in certain areas of Italy you can have wimax wireless which is similar to chiavetta but operated by smaller companies and is faster. Then in some areas there is wifi coverage like eolo of ngi.

The ESM is going up from 500 billion, to 2 trillion, without any country paying more, and the majority of the money will come from private investors? So, that the ESM can buy, if need be, bonds from Italy and Spain (and France I suppose) ""en masse"", if the market keep on giving them rates that are to high for them to pay.

Am I the only one who wonders how this will happen? The ESMF couldn't get any private investors, since frankly, they are not interested in spending money on saving Greece, Spain etc. Also, the  Eurozone has forced private investors to write down loans, for example to Greece. 

Yet, private investors  will contribute  1,5 *trillion* to buy Spanish and Italian bonds, if the need arises? 

Why on earth would the private investors do that? This sounds so weird. Is the ECB going to print the money if the private investors don't show up, since they just *might* not want to save Italy, Spain and other countries out of the goodness of their heart? 

And, of course, I wonder how many laws, rules and regulations this breaks in the ECB statue, the stability pact etc, but that question is academic now, they are not even protending to follow it. More for my own (pervese) interest.

Here are two of the studies I cited. The third one I can't find an abstract online.

&gt;First, even if this would indicate an actual correlation, it is not a compelling argument for forcing bans on smoking in all public places. Restaurant or bar owners who are concerned about smoking are free to ban smoking in their places at this moment, and if they do not ban it, their customers are free to leave. It's not like, without state intervention, non-smokers will be tied to their chairs and hoardes of smokers will gather and puff around them.

&gt;There are several restaurants, coffee houses and fast-foods around my house where smoking is not allowed, or is allowed only outside; unsurprisingly though, they're pretty empty, but since no one is forcing people to go to places where smoking is not banned, the logical inference is that clients -- some of which are non smoking -- simply decide not to go to them. 

That line of argument is nice on paper but doesn't match with reality.
Before the smoking bans there simply were no non-smoking places in Switzerland. The default was ""smoking is allowed"" and if you didn't like it then... well.. where else were you going to go anyway? 
So the end result was that people were simply expected to eat, drink and party in smoke filled rooms. The very best we had were ""non-smoking"" sections in restaurants that were separated from the smoking section by a mighty wall of air, which is kinda like having a non-pissing section in a pool separated from the pissing section by a line on the pools floor.",0,1348472367,null,0,false,0,c6cludd,t3_10cdah,t1_c6cludd,t1_c6cazzr,null,1429977447,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,dreugeworst,NETH,The Netherlands,"The results are reported in BLEU scores, measured against one reference translation.

This is important to note: the measure gives the highest possible score when it is the exact same as only one reference translation. Even human translators can't agree on the correct translation a lot of the time, which shows how flawed it is. Of course, it's measured on many sentences and an aggregate BLEU score is reported, which actually comes quite close to inter-annotator agreement.

Now, as for the BLEU score itself, it's based on the ratio of the number of word (groups) in the output that also occur in the reference, and the total number of words in the output. There's some kludges in there, to prevent an output like 'the' getting a perfect score if the reference contains the word 'the', but in essence that's it. 

Usually, this is measured on individual words, bigrams (any two consecutive words) and trigrams (any three consecutive words), but you can go up as far as you like. Better metrics are constantly being proposed, but none have fully caught on yet, either because they're too involved, or because the benefits aren't clear.

if you want to know more about the metric, read the original paper:

What about the rules that the ECB shouldn't bail out indivudual countries, no country should aid another country and each country is financial responsible for their own debt? It does strike me as if they are doing just that. Sorry, as I said, (perveted) interest :-). If they had followed the stability pact, most countries wouldn't have needed a baiout either, would they? 

Thank you for the PDF, it was interesting. 

I still do not understand the financing. It says so, in section E (as you mentioned) that it is a risky endevour, and thus, the ESMF will issue potection certificates. Even though they did this, the ESMF still didn't manage to get private investors. How are the ESM going to get private investors up to the point of 1,5 trillion Euros?

Also, the ESM are, if they are acting like the ESMF, guaranteeing money to the private investors (section E2). How can they do that, if no country in the Euro, has to give a single cent more. The only way I can see that if the ECB guarantees the money, but how? Are they printing it? Otherwise, we do have a situation where Germany has to come up with it, and even they might not like paying 1,5 *trillions*.

Would you mind elaborating on the fact that the ESM will be democratic? Also, how is the new treaty going to be written? Are you referring to a new treaty, as in a new ESM treaty, or as in a new Maastrich treaty/stability pact/ECB rules? 


I found this section interesting.


&gt;E14 - Why should an investor participate in the scheme rather than buy a plain vanilla bond issued by the Member State?
Whilst existing member state market yields are higher than the coupon under the scheme, investors holding the partial protection certificate will enjoy a degree of credit protection provided by EFSF bond collateral.

I *still* do not understand why it is so favourable to buy, for example, Spanish bonds before (for example)Dutch or American ones. Particularely since the Eurozone have forced private investors to take losses before, not something the US has.

Obviously the investors didn't either, since the ESMF failed to attract private investors. What is different now, for the investors? ",0,1348489181,null,0,false,0,c6cn8tu,t3_10dbi8,t1_c6cn8tu,t1_c6cmmv2,null,1429977909,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Oder passierte es ähnlich wie mit seinen Füßen: vielleicht wurde er von seinen Wünschen besessen, erst als er an die Macht kam? Es ist ja egal, wir wollen uns jetzt nicht auf Spekulationen einlassen.
Koki versteht, dass es so einem Typ wie dir schwer zu glauben ist, dass die scheinbar unwichtigen Ernährungsgewohnheiten und -neigungen, also der Inhalt des Tellers, die den Charakter enthüllen können, er will gar nicht darüber  nachdenken, was Proletarier wie du essen.
Aber dieses Vögelchen meint, dass Marschalls große Fähigkeit zur Selbsttäuschung schon daran zu erkennen war, dass er die ärztlichen Vorschläge ignorierte und sich um seine Gesundheit überhaupt nicht kümmerte.

I didn't do anything to ""create this situation"". I currently maintain and develop half a dozen server side apps along with the teams I work with. I wrote the date time utilities for one of these apps (on top of JodaTime). But I wouldn't bet money on any of them moving to a new time zone, bug free, without having a good long look at the code first. My bet is, that there will be bugs. A lot of bugs.

If you're certain that any and all date time code you've written is bullet proof, then you'll forgive me if I don't believe you. Date time code is one of the most common source of bugs there is. Very smart people make mistakes with it very often. 

&gt; Whatever assumption you made (and my first thought was that a smart library for date/time critical applications make it easy to convert times and dates between timezones)

Depends on the app. Where I have free reign, I use [JodaTime](http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/). But I often have to use whatever is already there, which is of mixed quality. All that code would have to have the hell tested out of it before I could be sure no bugs would crop up. 

&gt; That is understandable, but it sounds a whole lot different from what you wrote first.

How so? What I said was:

&gt; I work in London, and a lot of the code I have written uses either GMT or BST for calculating time differences between London and somewhere else.

We are not just talking about my code, nor are we talking about a single code base. We are talking about dozens of server side apps maintained by dozens of people. I currently have about 6 of those apps checked out, and am actively working on two of them. The code is of mixed quality, depending on the project, and I only wrote the majority of the date time utility code in one of them. It would be foolish to assume that the majority of that code will be correct if we suddenly change time zone. I can't make blanket statements about how ""our date time code"" works, other than to say I bet there are a lot of undiscovered bugs. 

&gt; It's just that in your case you mentioned that you're already accounting for the London timezone being GMT or BST. So surely your code already works properly for UTC+1 because it's running that way for half the year?

Yes, it already works correctly on GMT/UTC/BST/UTC+1 in the app I currently spend most of my time maintaining.  Personally, I prefer to use JodaTime to handle as much of this stuff for me as possible, but using a library is no cast iron guarantee of correctness. It would be foolish to assume that it *just works* without doing a lot of investigation. Until proven otherwise, I'm going to assume even my code has bugs in it. 

Past experience has taught me never to trust date time code, even if it has an extensive test suite associated with it. It's one of the most bug prone areas in software development.

Its not correct in all cases.

You can collect water from seas, rivers, etc. But it is also common in Germany to pump the water up from the earthground. In this case you ""rob"" the natural water savings in the earth. You take away water from the eco system in this moment. This way you could even change toe natural environment if you rob the water from agricultural fields, forrests etc.
All the water we save can be used by nature for itself.

Saving water saves working costs, chemical costs to clean it etc.

I live in Lower Saxony and people say we have the cleanest water in all of Germany. It is important to save it even if its only for the purpose of reliefing our eco system or the people working in those clearing facilities. Using less water also means, that those guys do not have to build up new water tanks etc to withstand the incoming mass of dirty water, thus allowing us to refine the water better.

Also seen in this subreddit with the constant accusations of British sabotage of the ""grand european project""

The attempt to seperate law into different things to suit your need is a twisting of reality to make you seem right. The Republicans are world champions in just that. Law is law, and the reality is, while I lived in Britain, laws didn't seem to be that big of a difference. The difference was the way of doing things. E.g. extended shopping hours, or legal alcohol age. I can't see how that suddenly makes you incapable of more integration and cooperation with the European Union.

What I don't like is being misquoted or misinterpreted. You said that you are a Europhile, but you act in the interest of people that might not like the use of this word in the right column, because they might associate it with an organization where half of Europe participates.

Υour answer lies in the same column:

&gt; ""50 countries, 230 languages, 731M people ... 1 subreddit""

This subreddit does not associate the term ""Europhile"" with the European Union, and is right in doing this. Many subscribers are not EU citizens, but they like Europe, its culture and its people. Such use predates any other use.

Europhilia has many faces, but Europe remains at its core. From [""Class in America""](http://books.google.gr/books?id=y7n2tJVd3YsC&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;ots=tT3v9FEE6v&amp;dq=europhilia&amp;pg=PA243&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=europhilia&amp;f=false):

&gt; Europhilia refers to the practice of adopting European manners and culture as a way of separating oneself from the masses. It was quite popular among Americans of the upper and upper middle classes throughout the **nineteenth century** and **remains an unheralded trend in contemporary society**.

&gt; From its foundation in 1949 the Council of Europe was aware of the need to give Europe a symbol with which its inhabitants could identify. On 25 October 1955 the Parliamentary Assembly unanimously approved the emblem of a circle of gold stars on a blue background. On 9 December 1955 the organisation's Committee of Ministers adopted the star-studded flag, which was launched officially on 13 December of the same year in Paris.

http://www.coe.int/aboutcoe/index.asp?page=symboles&amp;sp=logo

&gt; Unlike the flag and the anthem, which have become joint European symbols, the logo is the Council of Europe's own distinctive sign. The organisation adopted this logo on the occasion of its 50th anniversary in May 1999. Its use is subject to authorisation.

These are representatives of the CoE, presenting the flag of Europe, shared by the CoE and the EU.

The church handles a lot of name registration in Denmark) and when we die the church is there to send us off (Where it provides for well tended grave yards and the priests provide much needed grief counselling). Churches have a vital role in the most important moments of our life.

Hier wird mit der Erdungsstange am Rücken geforscht; Vorfälle wie [TGN1412](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGN1412) sind selten.

Patienten stehen hingegen in einem gewissen Abhängigkeitsverhältnis zum Arzt, das eine Güterabwägung im Einzelfall auf beiden Seiten erschwert. Nicht umsonst sind klinische Studien an Gefängnisinsassen verboten. Es erleichtert das Gewissen aller Beteiligten enorm, wenn vor Studienbeginn eine Ethikkommission festgestellt hat, dass dem Patienten durch die Studie nichts angetan wird. Es gibt Studien mit hochexpermientellen Therapien an todkranken Menschen. Dies passiert in dem Bereich, in dem individuelle Heilversuche mit unerprobten Arzneimitteln durchgeführt werden würden, und ich kann da nur hoffen, dass der Patient da adäquat aufgeklärt wird. Da aber in der Regel verschiedene Heilverfahren gegeneinander verglichen werden sollen, ist es nicht die normale Situation, dass der Studienteilnehmer individuellen Schaden zum Nutzen der Nachwelt auf sich nehmen soll: Er bekommt entweder eine Behandlung, von der man weiß, dass sie hilft, oder eine, von der man sich es erhofft.

Ob jetzt eine Ethikkommission in jedem Fall eingeschaltet werden muss, oder ob man nicht in bestimmten Fällen vereinfachte Verfahren anbieten kann (zum Beispiel bei diagnostischen Tests, bei denen dem Patienten bei der Routineblutabnahme studienbedingt 5 ml mehr abgezapft werden), das könnte man in der Tat diskutieren. 

Problematisch finde ich, wenn beim Vergleich mit einer etablierten Therapie zusätzlich Plazebokontrollen mitgeführt werden.  

Deinen Eingangssatz kann ich nur als absichtlich provokativ oder nur so dahergesagt auffassen. Im selben Abschnitt machst Du Einschränkungen (""besondere Bevölkerungsgruppe""), aber auch das ist eine Haltung, bei der man nach ethischen Abwägungen landet. Zu Zeiten der Weimarer Republik wurden Waisenkinder und weibliche Prostituierte ohne ihr Wissen Versuchen unterzogen, die [Tuskegee-Studie](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee-Syphilis-Studie) in den USA wurde bis zum Inkrafttreten der Deklaration von Helsinki durchgezogen.

true,darelight,,Muhackl,"Ok. So.
It's a bit hard to explain and it may be very different to my view in other parts of germany, but I try it:

For an engagement ring, the only thing I know is that only woman wears a ring. I never saw a man with engagement ring.
The engagement ring is often much more expensive than the actual wedding ring.

The wedding ring is mostly a gold band, that's true, also for today. There are, as always, people who do it otherwise. I think those people are slowly becoming more ""normal"" or the majority in today's generation.

So, what would I do? Expensive ring with nice stone as engagement ring. Gold ring (no band) with smaller stone and with a better ""design"" as wedding ring for her. For me - no idea?

I think you can decide this depending on how your girl is. I think a nice ""Klunker"" (maybe ""bling"" in english? I mean a ring with a rock on top or so) as engagement ring is a nice move - why not?

As a wedding ring... ask her or go with her to the jeweler? This is not unusual, my parents and my aunt did this. You are engaged, but not married yet, and go pick the ring. I know some girl whose heart would melt thinking about this :D


So overall: no real tradition. There is some kind of classic way, but it's not neccessary for you to take it.
I recommend a really nice ring for your proposal, and to pick the wedding ring together, but that's just my opinion.
You can do it as you want.

Another tip besides this all:
I've been together with my girlfriend for 4 years now and I'm not thinking to propose within the next 2? 3? years.
I know, you americans are very fast with getting engaged (sorry if this is a stereotype), but if you didn't do it before, do it know and get informed about what a german girl might find normal or adequate as a proposal date/point (Zeitpunkt).
I don't know how old you or her are, but marrying early or too soon became quite unusual and not well regarded in germany.

It's possible that an early proposal could be a mistake - in many ways. Just sayin', if you know what you do - I wish you the best and hope that everything runs fine.

&gt; we are criticising on a web forum

No, you're hanging on to a misleading title and a few lines of vague text plus two leaked documents who could be changed by now. You're not criticising. You're looking for every straw you can reach to express your disapproval of the EU. Like I said. It's exactly like /r/politics which is mostly like ""LOL look what bullshit romney said again"" and I'd like to see /r/europe being a place of information and news rather than circlejerking. 

&gt; you think people shouldn't even comment about it negatively on the Internet.

No. I actually think that people should stay to facts and hard evidence and not to speculations about conspiracies (and I think ""THEY WANT TO TAKE OUR FREEDOM!!!!"" as a response to ""well, we might want to try to cut terrorism communication without violating your freedoms but we don't know how yet"" is a bit overkill, isn't it?)


&gt; Maybe you like the policy though.

I've opposed every stupid internet thing politicians tried to implement. I also know that the project will most likely fail but shouting at politicians that try to do stupid stuff never worked before. Let them come up with an idea. Present the FACTS (that excludes shouting ""YOU JUST WANT TO MONITOR OUR INTERNET TRAFFIC!"") everywhere you can on the internet and protest against it.

&gt; The people have the last say on everything in a democracy, it's not there for the political class to give away to Europe as they have in so many countries. Please tell me how the French people rejecting the constitution and then getting it anyway in the form of Lisbon was democratic. I'll wait for a reply, but feel free to slither off to whatever undemocratic hell-hole you came from and not come back.

The ""undemocratic hell-hole"" I came from actually rejected ACTA. The EU is not a political instance above the nations like the national government is a step above the states. The people vote represents who should decide on behalf of the people. That sometimes works but sometimes it doesn't as we might have intended. ACTA was breaking German constitutional law and therefore, Germany didn't approve of ACTA. If the French politicians thought it was a good idea to ignore what the people wanted than that's a French problem but not a problem on EU level. Of course that's the problem of the system. If the national governments don't do what they were elected for, then the whole system breaks down but that's not the failure of the system but the failure of the people that run it. 


&gt; Those type of insults don't work against eurosceptics anymore, maybe you missed the memo.

That wasn't an insult. That was an observation. You're not just eurosceptic. Like I've said above. You hold on to every little piece you can find to oppose the EU without reasoning as it seems. Being sceptical is the best thing you can do and is the duty of every citizen but you're not dealing sceptical. You're dealing with speculations.

&gt; Also my country didn't devolve into a fascist dictatorship like yours did because we opposed stupid ideas like this one early rather than saying ""disapproving comments on this policy will have no effect"". I don't ususally support making war references but when it comes to a German saying ""everybody it's nothing to worry about"" to a proposal by anti-democratic forces to get Internet censorship capacity it's a little too juicy. If I was a conspiracy nutter I'd say you were defending the program by running interference here, but the truth is you are just a sad hollow husk of a citizen who doesn't know what democracy is.

Ant there's exactly the point why you're an idiot. Also, please only use quotes if you quote me. You've started the war references right after my first comment and I haven't said anything like what you've quoted here.

Yes, it does. That's exactly what Freedom of speech means. What it does not mean is libel and slander against **an individual**. And no, making fun of your religion is neither libel nor slander.

&gt;But making fun of the faith of other people is not and never will be the right of anyone. 

Yes, it is and it will be in sane, democratic countries. It is not and will not be however in backward countries.

I'm free to make fun of your dumb religion all I like. You're offended by that? Well, too fucking bad. You being offended has no meaning, no status and no bearing what so ever. It doesn't make you special in any way, shape or form. It makes you obnoxious and petty.

No, I don't think you can.

Serious things? Religion? Serious things are your debt crisis, your inability to mange your debt. Serious things are your media hate-/fearmongering against other countries (like comparing Germany to Nazi Germany). Serious things is your country's mentality of not actually grasping in how much shit they are in. Serious things are your fellow countrymen still living in the golden age not grasping that your country goes down the shitter, and your government doing next to nothing about that mentality.

&gt;The authors of this site believe that most of EU spending is in contradiction with the EU's proclaimed principle of subsidiarity. Neither agricultural nor regional subsidies are something that should be politically organized, let alone through a remote supranational body.
Moreover, subsidies distort markets and thus slow down economic growth. Last but not least, this supranational redistribution of taxpayers' money is politically unhealthy - it causes animosities, not friendship between nations.


&gt;What do we want to change about the EU?
In order to reduce inefficiencies and to keep peace among European nations these subsidies and contributions should be abolished.
If the EU should continue in exietence, it should live only on about EUR 20 billion a year (about 17% of the current budget) it raises from import duties. This would be enough to finance the EU's institutions and their necessary expenditures.",0,1348533087,null,0,false,0,c6cxuvy,t3_10ewpz,t1_c6cxuvy,t3_10ewpz,null,1429982832,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

The ones I met while traveling are kind and very nice, they will help you with bags, find your platform, even offer you half of their sandwich if they hear your stomach grumbling! 

However here in Spain I get touched. A lot. Way more than I'm okay with and I am dating an italian and spent quite a lot of time in italy-that should say something. The first few weeks I was here I went out on my own and I had several men follow me through stores, follow me home, get on their bikes and insist on taking me home, cut me off in small streets, jeer, call and all sorts of other lovely harassment. Also: never. ever. ever. go into a male's flat unless you plan to sleep with them. I have made this mistake buying weed and looking at plants and it always ends with me pushing someone off of me and fleeing the building. Even if you know the person (I knew these people and met them through friends who knew them well) just don't do it. If you're in a group that's fine but never by yourself or with one of his friends. 

Other than that though, spanish men are like all men everywhere. There are metal heads, activists, punks, travelers, smokers, romantics, studious, cool guys and everything in between. Love is in the air here and it's easy to find someone who wants to share their bed even for a night if that's what you're looking for =)",0,1348533461,null,0,false,0,c6cxyaj,t3_10f230,t1_c6cxyaj,t3_10f230,null,1429982878,6,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,6
