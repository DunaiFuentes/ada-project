Because I'm tired of seeing articles that simplify the problem so much. They're all over the place. The only purpose they serve is to assign the full blame on the Greek people. That's what I'm against. 

When back in 2009, Papandreou started his rhetoric about how clientelism and corruption and tax evasion were the source of the problem, I was sceptical but glad. Sceptical because there was no real evidence that the economic problems could be attributed to those social problems. But glad because the crisis would give an impetus and some momentum to push Greek society in the right direction. 

Instead, you know what happened? Every foreigner took this narrative and turned it into a tale about how the profligate Greeks got their just desserts. The other reasons of the crisis were forgotten. On TV or on forums on the internet or in private conversations, whenever the Greek problem is mentioned, everyone is more than happy to thoughlessly repeat that story: ""oh, you should have worked longer hours"", ""oh, it's because you all get a pension when you're 40 years old"", ""oh, it's because no one at all pays their taxes"". You have to realise this is very frustrating and this is why why I'm complaining now even though I want to see these problems fixed.

Here is Wikipdia quote on the position of the German small/medium sized enterprises:

&gt; Germany's Mittelstand companies (SME) are a very important part of the country's economy. In 2003, these companies employed 70.2% of all employees in private business, according to the Institut für Mittelstandsforschung. Some predicted their demise that year due to narrowing of credit availability and a record number of firms collapsing[2]. By 2011, these predictions had failed to materialize, Mittelstand companies continue to employ 70% of Germany’s workforce and contribute to 50% of its gross domestic product (GDP, $3.3 trillion) [3]. Many Mittelstand companies are export-oriented and contribute to Germany being the worlds second largest exporter. They focus on innovative and high value manufactured products and occupy worldwide niche market leadership positions in numerous B2B segments.[1] They are typically privately owned and based in small rural communities.

No it took even longer in many places and this discrimination certainly wasn't limited to the Italians.  Though you are right, I was reflecting too far back in time.  However American had a growing and shifting culture that while hitting a rather stiff period in which the idea of a mainstream culture arose and took off,, has since shifted to embrace and support multiculturalism.  We have also never had the shortage of space issue or the centuries of cultural heritage that italian communities have.  That was my point.  
Rome does need to step up and either take care of, provide training for or other get off the street the thousands of homeless they have in their major cities.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; I also have a hard time explaining my friends why we need to strengthen the greek economy when they just read that help is not being accepted in Greece.

Well, the previous time Greece defaulted, people from the big countries came and took over the tax collection and toll collection agencies, redirecting everything so that the creditors are paid before everyone else. It's not really surprising that any help of that form will be seen with suspicion in Greece. By the way, was the offer to send German tax collectors to help really rejected by the Greek government? I remember that there was some fuss about it but I don't remember if a final decision was made to say no.

&gt; Your point was that Greece has never a chance to begin with, competing against multinationals. My point was that not giant and aggressive multinationals make economically powerful countries successful, but small niche enterprises.

It was a mistake to doubt the correctness of your claim and I'm not challenging that any more: it is true that big multinationals do not earn most of the GDP in economically strong countries. What I'm now doubting is whether that fact is a good metric to judge how countries interact in terms of competitiveness. For example, 50% may still be much bigger than economically weaker countries. Or that percentage may not even be correlated with the problem of competitiveness at all. 

My observation is thus: I see big foreign enterprises dominating the Greek market and swallowing the smaller domestic enterprises, either by buying them out or out-competing them. I don't see how comparing the contribution of these big companies to the German GDP with the contribution of smaller German companies to the German GDP gives any insight or refutes the aforementioned observation.",0,1332950523,null,0,true,0,c45w1pg,t3_rhc0f,t1_c45w1pg,t1_c45upjw,null,1428610582,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Cmq se vuoi fare la persona adulta: 

Non è che ""ce l'ho"", non dipingermi come uno che entra in un manicomio e prende in giro i suoi abitanti. Sono questi **terroni** che da una vita pensano di prenderci per il culo: siamo più uomini, più focosi, più furbi, il cibo da noi è migliore, le solite cazzate che a noi, in faccia, dicono (meglio se nascosti dietro uno schermo, of course). Poi in un gesto superipocrita non appena possono lasciano tutto per venire qui a fare un lavoro del cazzo pur di star qui, dalla terza media ai laureati.

Però **ben lungi** dal ringraziare il Nord che essendo Nord garantisce cosucce come un lavoro, *la possibilità di non essere sparati per strada, non vivere nell'immondizia, nella mafia o nell'ignoranza letale* e altre quisquilie si mettono a fare le loro little south Italy e allora giù di comitati e trovate per succhiar soldi alla cosa pubblica, favori reciproci, etc.

Nota come riproducono la stessa struttura alveare, nidificata, parassitica che ha fatto del sud il sud nonostante tutte le varie casse del mezzogiorno, orgogliosi di essere *i più furbi*. La cosa ridicola è spesso la convinzione d'essere più furbi convive con la voglia di non tornare più ""giù"", frase sempre in mia presenza troncata perchè non devo sapere quello che già so di ""giù"": nel dubbio sono omertosi.

I più onesti fra loro arrivano, una volta pensionati (...), a riconoscere la superiorità del Nord. Pochi capiscono il trade-off della civiltà, dove gli Italiani per essere responsabili devono perdere un pò di ""Italianità"" in favore di ...oh, ospedali dove non gettano via il sangue? Prostitute per strada lungo le statali in pieno giorno? Ma queste son cose che si sanno da decenni, basta ora è ridicolo e sei un troll. 

Dall'esperienza personale perchè mi fanno incazzare: mi arrivano sotto casa, io che nel mio piccolo cerco di tendere al bello ed al buono, si prendono i lavori del cazzo e *si vantano di venir pagati per non far nulla* (testuali parole), sempre con grande arroganza e pretesa superiorità. Si pigliano una tamarra di qui (contentissima che finalmente ""c'è qualcuno che la capisce"") perchè non riescono ad ambire a qualcosa di migliore, e creano l'ambiente *accogliente* per l'arrivo dei loro amici, il classico virus che non tamponato si ramifica.

Oppure arrivano qui, si iscrivono al dams, mi guardano dall'alto al basso (e non posso osare interferire!) finchè non me li ritrovo a dar volantini nell'ipermercato di turno. In tal caso, non essendo puerile, mi limito a guardarli con un pò di pietà. Intanto il danno alla cosa pubblica è fatto in ogni caso, per vari versi, e irreparabile.

Basta, sono stato preso in giro abbastanza da questo erede della Magna Grecia (magna, che l'è bbono!), se vuoi una descrizione più accurata di questa gente che è parassita dovunque va ([five families](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Families) anyone?), mi costringe a dimostrare di essere un minimo civile all'estero come se fossi un criminale, sarò più che contento di sfogarmi deridendovi quando avrò qualcosa che non va. Intanto arriva il tldnr

**tl;dnr**: Sono **deboli** e non ce la fanno col loro cervellino a reggere il peso della civiltà e di una società ordinata, si approfittano gettandosi a pesce di qualsiasi cosa e sono offensivi a tutti i cinque sensi.

Their rhetoric is anti-capitalist, Stalinist and nationalist. They follow the dogma that communism means that the state should have strict centralised control over all aspects of society. Their followers are considerably more brainwashed than the followers of other parties in Greece. 

Internally, their structure is almost totalitarian. There is a chain of command and the way the members will act is decided at the top and then propagated to the regional chambers. They also have some faux-democratic discussions, in which the commands coming from the top are accepted by the members by acclamation.

With all that said, they're probably not as radical as they seem. They protest separately from everyone else. Their protests are the most peaceful ones. They are also known to have helped the police against other protesters multiple times in the past and also during the current crisis. My impression is that at this point they're as bourgeoisie as it gets. 

According to the current polls, they will probably get around 8-12% of the vote in the coming elections. It is doubtful whether they will accept to be part of a coalition government. They've tried it once in the recent past, in 1989, and it left them with a bitter taste. It seems that they are quite happy playing eternally the role of the opposition and giving the people a way to vent.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The point that I'm making is that Libertarian ideas and ideals will actually regress a first world country into a third world one.  You can see that now in the U.S. (and to a lesser extent, the U.K.), where a drive to privatize many services are leading to a declining quality of life for all citizens.

One example of many -- the U.S. has endeavored to privatize much of its prison system, and now as a result you have the largest prison population per capita and in total in the entire world.

Another example of many - the current healthcare situation in the U.S.  Libertarians and other conservatives are adamantly opposed to providing public, universal health care.  The privatized solution though currently in place delivers some of the worst health care metrics in the developed world coupled with the highest costs.  

Having been to many, many developing countries, I can tell you that it is not a ""new independence"" or their history only that is holding them back -- the common characteristics of Haiti, The Philippines, of Central America, etc. is that the thought of having public, well funded public institutions funded by proper progressive taxation is totally alien to the mindset of the average person there.

Here in the U.S., where Libertarians are fighting tooth and nail to dismantle public institutions, trying to kill the USPS and highway infrastructure spending and pushing for further privatization of education, it is done with the mindset of ""I don't want MY taxes paying for THOSE bloodsuckers"" -- about 50% of the U.S. population actively views the poor not as impoverished, but as parasites that are ""getting rich off the government"" while the ""hardworking"" struggle.  Even those that benefit from public institutions and a social safety net have this mindset, and it is pure insanity.

true,gwyner,null,null,"I needed to learn to speak 3-4 languages over the past few years for my job (German was one of them; I'm living in Austria right now, actually), and in the process have landed on a pretty damn good method.  It got me to C1 fluency in French in about 5 months, and I'm currently using it with Russian (and plan on reaching C1 equivalent fluency by September).  At this point, I go in 4 stages:





* Stage 1: Learn the correct pronunciation of the language.  Doing this does a few things –  because I’m first and foremost learning how to hear that language’s sounds, my listening comprehension gets an immediate boost before I even start traditional language age learning.  Once I start vocabulary training, I retain it better because I’m familiar with how words should sound and how they should be spelled.  (Correct spellings in French, for example, are much easier to remember when there’s a connection between the spelling and the sound), and once I finally start speaking to native speakers, they don't switch to English for me or dumb down their language, which is awesome sauce.  If you're learning a language with a different alphabet, this is where you learn the phonetic alphabet(s) (Kana, for Japanese or Pinyin for Chinese, for example)

 



* Stage 2: Vocabulary and grammar acquisition (itself in a few stages), no English allowed.
I start with a frequency list and mark off any words I can portray with pictures alone (basic nouns and verbs).  I put those in an [Anki deck](http://www.towerofbabelfish.com/Tower_of_Babelfish/Anki.html) and learn them.  Once I have some words to play with, I start putting them together.  I use Google translate (Exception to no English rule - just be careful there's no English in your Anki deck) and a grammar book to start making sentences, then get everything double-checked at lang-8.com before putting them into my Anki deck.  Turning them into fill-in-the-blank flashcards builds the initial grammar and connecting words.  As vocab and grammar grow, I eventually move to monolingual dictionaries and writing my own definitions for more abstract words (again doublechecked at lang-8.com).  This builds on itself; the more vocab and grammar you get, the more vocab and grammar concepts you can describe in the target language.  Eventually you can cover all the words in a 2000 word frequency list as a foundation and add any specific vocab you need for your own interests.





* Stage 3: Listening, writing and reading work
Once I have a decent vocabulary and familiarity with grammar, I start writing essays, watching TV shows and reading books, and talking (mostly to myself) about the stuff I see and do.  Every writing correction gets added to the Anki deck, which continues to build my vocab and grammar.





* Stage 4: Speech
At the point where I can more or less talk (haltingly, but without too many grammar or vocab holes) and write about most familiar things, I find some place to immerse in the language and speak all the time (literally.  No English allowed or else you won't learn the skill you're trying to learn, which is adapting to holes in your grammar or vocabulary by going around them rapidly and automatically without having to think about it).  I prefer Middlebury college, but a few weeks in the target country will work as well if you're very vigorous with sticking to the target language and not switching to English.  If you're extremely strict with yourself, your brain adapts pretty quickly and learns how to put all the info you learned in stages 1-3 together quickly enough to turn into fluent speech.

 

You should be able to get quite a bit into stage 2 and maybe into stage 3 before you arrive, at which point you're in a perfect position to take a class and start speaking all the time.


I've written a (not yet available) book on the topic and a (now available) website, [Tower of Babelfish.com](http://www.towerofbabelfish.com).

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; Well yeah, if you convince them that parts of Islam should not be taken seriously then Islam will no longer be a problem. It's not like even the most devout Christians take all of the Bible seriously. I mean have you seen some of the crap in Leviticus?

As a predominantly gay man — Why, yes. Yes, I have. :P

But that's exactly my point. It's a little bit silly to allow the Christians to pick and choose within their religion (they still eat shrimp, after all), and then not extend the same freedom to Muslims.

&gt; At the same time the imams preaching violence are anything but poor or uneducated.

But you have to understand — those are the ones who are *doing* the manipulation. The lack of education and literacy is only what allows them to do it.

The big question is ""why"", of course, and my answer would be: Giving the people a scary enemy is a good way to distract them from your own shortcomings as a leader. Most of these people are corrupt and rich as fuck, and they want it to stay that way, but for that to happen they need to keep their populations focused on external enemies.

If this sounds familiar to contemporary American politics or 20th century European politics, it is probably no coincidence. :-P

&gt; Many of the terrorists and would-be terrorists that I read about, whether Islamic or not, are doing what they are no poor or uneducated and they are committing horrible acts out of sheer conviction, without any connection to poverty.

Well, there will always be crazy people. That's not unique to Islam (as Breivik and countless others are proof), but if you look at their rationale, it is almost always the case that they see some ""public enemy"" that everybody else disagrees is an enemy, and then they take to drastic measures in their hopeless fight against this ""enemy"".

My theory is that ""simple"" German is considerably more complicated than ""simple"" English, and that your pronunciation has to be at least pretty close to accurate on many words before normal people will understand you. 

Contrast that to English where you can butcher almost all pronunciation and still have a chance at being understood (or at least getting a job as a professor at a major US university, as several of mine could have attested)

DON'T give up, though - at some point you cross a threshold and then it gets much much easier. 

Biggest advice I can give if you're a native English speaker: learn the German vowel sounds. The other sounds like 'R' will take a lifetime to pronounce properly (if ever) but won't impede understanding too much. 

In English, especially American, we're super lazy with the vowels. You can pronounce all of them with your lips slack. For German, from an american perspective you have to ridiculously over emphasize their pronunciation. E.g. when you speak an O, your lips need to be in an O shape. 

I don't know how to explain it better, but try listening to the German alphabet somewhere and focusing on A, E, I, and O.

The violence of the far left is destroying public and private properties, destoying peoples means of living, putting in danger peoples' lives by throwing stones and molotovs (cops are people too). They give a reason (αφορμή) to the police to use force. Excessive force. 

That's the short term consequences. The long term are the worst. People are afraid to go to protests because they don't want to be beaten up or charged with nonexistent crimes.

Yes, I know. But at least the killing was politically motivated. The guy was probably corrupted as hell. I don't mean to say that the punishment for being blamed with corruption should be death. But I see a difference between that and hate-crimes that indiscriminately kill innocent immigrants. Is it the same to you? I'm not trying to saying that the killing was justified.

What I described is of course a generalization. Yet it has influenced german culture and shows even nowadays. It's less about things germans do and expect but things we **don't** do and **don't** expect. E.g. we don't expect visitors to learn our language or adapt to our culture. Patriotism almost disappeared (which isn't bad out of itself) and with it disappeared our ability to treasure the things we've got. Relics from the past are just there and even though we have some oft the most stunning landscapes in europe (Mittelrheintal), beautiful citys (Dresden, Berlin, Hamburg, Marburg), a wide variety of culture (Goethe, Schiller, Bach, Beethoven, Händel, Dürer) ancient and medieval monuments (Cathedrals in Aachen, Cologne, Mainz and Frankfurt, Castles all over the landscape, city walls, operas, roman villae, the Limes), a powerful and emotional language (Kafka!) and what not else... you'll seldomly hear a german praise all this. We just lost the ability to cherish all this and don't expect others to do so. In fact most of us are surprised when foreigners recognise the beauty that surrounds us and call us out on it.

My first two times in Germany, I had only been learning German for like 4 &amp; 8 months, and it was really frustrating because the people I was staying with thought that my accent was so good that I was able to speak perfect German.  I tried as much as I could to speak, and they would speak to me in German, but sometimes they expected too much, and even got upset when I expressed my frustrations about how the friends I was staying with never included me in the conversation, and I couldn't just chime in because I barely understood anything beyond the basics.

It's tough for me to say if German is difficult to learn - I had a very easy time learning it, but the grammar can be very complicated.  I personally still struggle with speaking and vocabulary, but hopefully being there for 2 months will help.

Absolutely and unapologetically.  Hell yes I use swear words, because it's fucking stupid.

Communism is utter and complete nonsense.  It's not a question of ""pseudo-intellectual"".  You're familiar with the scientific concept that ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof""?  Communism is, essentially, an extraordinary claim.

You want examples? 

Fine, I can't speak for ""all"" their platforms, because there are too many to deal with between the LCR, the NPA, the CPF, etc.  And I'm not terribly interested in digging into the detailed elements of their semantics to prove a point that is self-evident.  Frankly, if I don't need to even piss near anything by Eric Hobsbawm again for as long as I live, I'll be a happy camper.  

But here you:

- In the NPA's case, their main founding principle is that they are ""not the Socialist party"".  That's a great basis for a political movement.

- communism, in pretty much every form imaginable, has been tried.  In every single example beyond the simple Rochedale cooperatives, going from its mild to its extreme forms, it has ended in increasing degrees of failure and tears and human suffering.

- nationalization and collectivization, in all but the fewest and most extreme cases, has never worked.  In France's case, it created recession, corruption, and instability.  

- you're no doubt familiar with the argument of the fundamental incompatibility of collectivist ideals with the human instinct to engage in relatively free market trade, so I won't go into it. 

- collectivist systems require an autocratic enforcement mechanisms.  I don't care whether it's /r/anarchism yawping about how, yes, moderation can be reconciled with the concept of anarchy, or the idea of a ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" being required to force society to evolve into some higher form of equality - in the case of states, this has never, ever, ever worked despite having been tried enough times and killed enough people to make a sane person want to punch anyone waving a red flag.  

- it displays a complete ignorance of ""capitalism"" through its class-based adversarial struggle approach, rather than understanding that it is a nuanced, multifaceted incarnation of the way basic human interactions work.  Seeking to abolish it is, you know, fuck it, why am I even bothering.  

Suffice it to say, anyone advocating that sort of horseshit can safely be ignored as a lunatic or a moron.

By the way, downvote away, I don't give a crap, but the implied ""fuck you I don't like what you say"" is not a good basis for expecting a reply to your - I assume - rhetorical question.

Even if I accept that that there is such an instinct, your argument is not very convincing. There are lots of instincts we learn to suppress in order to run a civilised society. Take blood feuds for example. We all recognise the human instinct of revenge when you're wronged, but we have decided to leave justice to the courts instead of taking things into our own hands.

No, they don't. There are lot of bottom up mechanisms to do the same job. Take Wikipedia as an example. Knowledge sharing and editing is done in a collectivist manner.

Yes they do. Fascists, communists, racists, Islamic extremists, the IRA, anti-abortion activists etc etc. Meanwhile our states have supported numerous wars of aggression in the Middle East that have killed tens of thousands and displaced millions, largely carrying the mistaken assumption that we can bring liberal democracy to the world by force. The point being there is nothing *exceptional* about Islam.

&gt;Yes some of the classical knowledge was preserved in the Ottoman empire but Islam has nothing to do with it so stop trying attribute it to something that is factually inaccurate. 

Before you start asserting what is and is not a historical fact, at least get your chronology sorted. The Islamic Golden age was the period *before* the foundation of the Ottoman Empire. It did have something to do with the dominant religion, but this has become something of a pointless tangent at this point.

My initial argument was that European claims to be culturally superior are based on subjective, selective and partial views of history. Right now, we have relatively peaceful and democratic societies, but we had to drag the entire world through the two biggest wars in history to get there.

&gt;Multiculturalism by definition means that all collections of ideas are equally valid. 

No it doesn't. Multiculturalism a degree of tolerance is exercised over cultural differences. It is a rejection of aggressive nationalism, demanding all assimilate into one monoculture (like the Middle Eastern regimes you dislike so much often insist on). Tolerance btw, not be to be confused with having like or accept an idea. It is one of the basic ideas of a free and democratic society.

&gt;Today there is just a handful of separate states that are governed by Islamic law, they mostly don't like each other and it is plain to see what that type of governance it has resulted in.

First of all, neither of your examples existed for long enough to prove its maturity and viability.  Is that a fair criterion by which to judge a society/system of government (or absence thereof)?  No.  But again - the burden of proof lies with the society itself to establish and demonstrate its long-term feasibility.

I'm actually quite familiar with the Catalan example.  I don't believe it applies at all.  You'll note that its existence was most strongly marked by the conflicts of POUM with various other groups, and the accompanying violence and killings that are not the hallmark of a functioning society.  The ""anarchist"" component of the region (you can hardly call it a country) was more of a collection of semi-autonomous temporary mini-societies, analogous to micro-versions of the 1871 Paris commune, than an overarching system of anarchy or collectivism.  The whole thing, independent of Francoist assault, was riven by factional violence, massacres, dogmatic differences, and general instability.

&gt; There are lots of instincts we learn to suppress in order to run a civilised society.

We suppress instincts that are contrary to the functioning of a civil, stable society.  The instinct to trade and to better one's position is not one of these.  I stand by my point.

Lest you mistake my argument for one in favor of unrestricted, unregulated capitalism, it is not.  It merely concerns the basic human drive to trade and invest.  This is one of the points where Marx digressed into utopian, unrealistic la-la-land with his idea of the fullness of labor.  Sure, it's nice, but trade, and its resulting division of labor and subsequent investment structure, are things that will spring up organically in any society.  Hey, I have extra shoes, want to trade for that potato?

&gt; Take Wikipedia as an example. Knowledge sharing and editing is done in a collectivist manner.

Wikipedia has a [power-user cabal](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/12/04/wikipedia_secret_mailing/), and a benevolent dictator.  Jimmy Wales has in the past exhibited a significant amount of fungible power in the institution, both in overall guidance and in detailed (sometimes controversial) actions, so I disagree.

Every supposedly egalitarian society is prone to develop this - from the coop I was a member of at university on upward.  Some people will always be more involved in politics than others, and these will inevitably tend to collect power.  I subscribe totally to the idea that power corrupts - the only difference is that an avowedly egalitarian or anarchist system lacks the control mechanisms that can be developed (note my careful choice of words here) in a structured, evolved, political and economic system.

&gt; Can you explain that, please?

Consider it a general statement on the naive statements advocating general, unrealistic things like the abolition of liberal economic systems, or absolute and enforced equality for all in society, or more specific policy elements such as lowered pension age, vastly increased income and property tax, industrial and economic nationalization, and other similar points which characterize most ""communist"" party platforms.  

In this case I was specifically referring to the plethora of naive, shouty, loud (yes I am being judgmental because these assholes blocked traffic and broke windows near our place more often than I care to remember)  far-leftist parties present in France - much of whose membership is made up of what appears, at least on the surface, to be spoiled rich kids, angsty hyperidealistic students, and disgruntled union members who don't understand that they long ago ceased to be representative of workers at large.  

Furthermore, I am also angered at the fact that a lot of the far-left ideology you see in European societies is pushed by people originating from circumstances best described as ""comfortable"", with the comparative luxury of a reasonably generous welfare state and functioning infrastructure allowing them to engage in their politics, up, who like to roundly condemn the economic and political systems which brought about these basics in the first place.  It's analogous to the kid who keeps a Che poster on his wall, without any clue of the economic devastation, political destruction, and personal brutality that the guy represented.  Because fuck the power, man.

&gt; You just blatantly called everyone that disagreed with you an idiot.

No, I call people idiots and uniformed and all sorts of other choice epithets if they believe that there is a credible place for communist thought and ideology in the world, outside of academic hypothetical circlejerking. I stand behind that 100%, no matter whom it pisses off.  I view this as no better than any other unrealistic, unfounded mumbo-jumbo, including scientology or anti-vaccination stupidity.


I apologize, but I am going to have to curtail this discussion and agree to disagree.  My net is too fucking slow and I have too much work to do to carry on.

I cant think of a Togolese who would not want the government to take care of these things. Togolese are obviously going to be hesitant to increase tax as they have very little disposable income and because they will sceptical of the results (rightly so). However, they are not just ""anti-tax"". There was a campaign recently in Togo in which citizens wanted a new tax on them so that the National football team could be run better. Niger qualified to the African Nations Cup football tournament, and the government could not deal with it as it was facing a drought. Niger citizens agreed to pay more on their mobile subscriptions to finance the trip of their team.

I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say that you are using the example of Philipines on the rest of developing countries.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"In general subsidies are very harmful for the economy, market distortions caused by them not only hurt the local economy, but also economies of other countries. They also largely favour big countries that have the power to back their domestic industries until a point where they win over their competitors in smaller countries. For small trading nations, it is vital that states don't give subsidies, and its one of the best things that the EU has done in Europe, levelled the playing field that businesses can compete in open and fair market.

I also reject the usage of the description neoliberal economic policy, it is an empty buzz word. What the EU is doing is advancing pro-market economy policies, making the economic more free. However pro-market economy policies aren't in conflict with for example pro-wellfare state policies. The first is about allowing economic actors freedom of choice and keeping the state out of the market, while the later is largely about redistribution of money between individuals. 

But if we go back to the shipyard, what you are forgetting from your calculation is there are potential costs on subsidizing the shipyard: capital tied into the business could be used elsewhere; facilities could be used by someone else; human resources could be used by other companies; etc... You are also forgetting that by providing subsidies you take the pressure of from the owners and from the employees to perform better - they don't have to as the state has their back. That is again a potential cost. What the subsidies in real are doing are wasting money and preventing the transformation of the economy that will sooner or later come.

I also don't see that the EU policies are hindering installation of democracy, from my point of view it is the other way. Failure to advance pro-market economic policies have hindered growth and formation of the civil society supporting the democratic system. One of the best examples on how pro-market economy policies can transform a country is Estonia that has from the start embraced free economic policies. With those policies they have made wonderful progress, their GDP nominal per capita is now 16880 USd, compare this for example to Belarus (6118) or Ukraine (3575) that have failed to embrace free market economy. The fact of the matter is that the only way for countries to grow is by embracing market economy, and that is what the EU is advancing for, and rightly so.",0,1333038630,null,0,false,0,c46amhg,t3_rhk3r,t1_c46amhg,t1_c465ytt,null,1428617646,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,gwyner,null,null,"A bit late, but still! I needed to learn to speak 3-4 languages over the past few years for my job, and in the process have landed on a pretty damn good method.  It got me to C1 fluency in French in about 5 months, and I'm currently using it with Russian (and plan on reaching C1 equivalent fluency by September).  At this point, I go in 4 stages:





* Stage 1: Learn the correct pronunciation of the language.  Doing this does a few things –  because I’m first and foremost learning how to hear that language’s sounds, my listening comprehension gets an immediate boost before I even start traditional language age learning.  Once I start vocabulary training, I retain it better because I’m familiar with how words should sound and how they should be spelled.  (Correct spellings in French, for example, are much easier to remember when there’s a connection between the spelling and the sound), and once I finally start speaking to native speakers, they don't switch to English for me or dumb down their language, which is awesome sauce.  If you're learning a language with a different alphabet, this is where you learn the phonetic alphabet(s) (Kana, for Japanese or Pinyin for Chinese, for example)

 



* Stage 2: Vocabulary and grammar acquisition (itself in a few stages), no English allowed.
I start with a frequency list and mark off any words I can portray with pictures alone (basic nouns and verbs).  I put those in an [Anki deck](http://www.towerofbabelfish.com/Tower_of_Babelfish/Anki.html) and learn them.  Once I have some words to play with, I start putting them together.  I use Google translate (Exception to no English rule - just be careful there's no English in your Anki deck) and a grammar book to start making sentences, then get everything double-checked at lang-8.com before putting them into my Anki deck.  Turning them into fill-in-the-blank flashcards builds the initial grammar and connecting words.  As vocab and grammar grow, I eventually move to monolingual dictionaries and writing my own definitions for more abstract words (again doublechecked at lang-8.com).  This builds on itself; the more vocab and grammar you get, the more vocab and grammar concepts you can describe in the target language.  Eventually you can cover all the words in a 2000 word frequency list as a foundation and add any specific vocab you need for your own interests.





* Stage 3: Listening, writing and reading work
Once I have a decent vocabulary and familiarity with grammar, I start writing essays, watching TV shows and reading books, and talking (mostly to myself) about the stuff I see and do.  Every writing correction gets added to the Anki deck, which continues to build my vocab and grammar.





* Stage 4: Speech
At the point where I can more or less talk (haltingly, but without too many grammar or vocab holes) and write about most familiar things, I find some place to immerse in the language and speak all the time (literally.  No English allowed or else you won't learn the skill you're trying to learn, which is adapting to holes in your grammar or vocabulary by going around them rapidly and automatically without having to think about it).  I prefer Middlebury college, but a few weeks in the target country will work as well if you're very vigorous with sticking to the target language and not switching to English.  If you're extremely strict with yourself, your brain adapts pretty quickly and learns how to put all the info you learned in stages 1-3 together quickly enough to turn into fluent speech.

When Germany began to unite as a nation, there was a seperation between north and south. The first confederation (Norddeutsche Bund) only involved the northern german states (France and Austria didn't allow a unified Germany at the time) and when the southern states finally joined in, Bavaria asked for a lot of special treatment like maintaining an own postal and railway service and lower federal taxes, while the other southern states (Hesse-Darmstadt, Baden and Württemberg) joined in with much less fuzz. Bavaria was a pretty large nation and had sided with Austria more than once, so independece was always an option. Some bavarians still don't view Bavaria as part of Germany.

To this day Bavaria maintains it's own conservative party (CDU for the rest of Germany, CSU for Bavaria) which is involved in all conservative federal governments, because the two parties stick together on federal issues. This causes some (bavarian) secretaries to make politics for their own ""Land"" (Si.) instead of the whole federation. Also the ""Länder"" (Pl.) help each other financially out, with the so called ""Länderfinanzausgleich"": Economically strong states and the federal government transfer some of their taxes to ecenomically weak Länder. Bavaria recieved funds for several decades and now pays money itself, because they did really well over time. This leads to them oftentimes calling for reforms to dismantle the Länderfinanzausgleich. On a more personal level, Bavarians are said to be close-knit, see themselves as ""better people"" than the remaining nation, and more often than others display an unbearable amount of arrogance and self-esteem (Franz Josef Stauß - prime minister of Bavaria at the time - once said: ""I don't care who's chancellor under my rule"" and once ordered a raid of the editorial department of germanys most important weekly paper, back then). The Schwaben (on of the people of Baden-Württenberg) behave in a similar way, but much more descrete. Thus they are thought of much better. Then there's an indipendence movement in Franconia, which has been part of Bavaria for quite some time. As some of the best beer of our nation originates from Franconia they get a lot of sympathies for their ""struggle"" against their occupiers ;-)

At least this is how I have experienced it. I'm from southern Hesse, which is considered part of southern germany and borders Franconia/Bavaria.

2. This is similar to the above case, only the third party is not the state. So, a slave freeing himself by killing his master is okay. But a third party taking pity on the slave and freeing him by killing the master is bad? That's pretty counter-intuitive to me. What's your perspective here? Helping others is immoral?

As for the rest, you probably need to define what you mean by ""direct"" exactly. Your example with losing the job seems to have to do with severity more than it has to do with directness. The cause of harm is direct in both cases, only in one it's an economic decision by the boss while in the other it's a kind of violence. 

&gt; I am not a scholar of right-wing racism towards immigrants, but I think their central problem is the crime related to immigrants (or at least they think that crime is mainly driven by immigrants)

Since in the right-wingers' minds the harm the immigrants cause is direct to their livelihood, does that mean that to your moral system the right-wingers' attacks on immigrants are more morally justified than the left-wingers' attacks on police / banks etc?

What is described here is most striking when me and my (english-speaking) friends go to Starbucks. We speak english together while waiting in line, and once it's our turn, the cashier automaticly starts english. And even if my friends try to speak German, it's not recognised. After all, most stuff is english already; so basicly the only thing they can say in German is ""ein"" or ""ja"" and ""nein"", since the names of everything is already english. What they could do is purposely mispronounce the english with a German accent, but that sounds kind of silly. After they had placed their orders, the cashier is always surprised when it's my turn and I respond in perfect German. Of course this experience can be quite frustrating for them.

So what we're doing from now on is that **I** go first, with my German, and then my friends follow. We observed that the cashier is then much less likely to switch to english.",0,1333060301,null,0,false,0,c46fa0t,t3_rit9m,t1_c46fa0t,t3_rit9m,null,1428619789,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Saying that Islam was the basis of greatness of the Ottoman empire is false. When Islam rose to prominence in the Ottoman empire the printing press was banned and all free thought was repressed thus it regressed and finally collapsed into what it is today. 

I did not say it was, and as I pointed out the time I was highlighting was earlier than the OE. I made clear above what the point of bringing it up was.

&gt;It has do to with the collection of ideas those people hold and not the people themselves. They incompatible with those ideas that have already won unless they are reformed and the Koran, in this case, is rewritten.

They are not compatible with the Bible, unless the that is rewritten. Except, of course, religions alter and bend to fit the societies they are part of. Islam is no exception.

&gt;The definition is to promote different institutions because different groups hold different collections of ideas, this is unacceptable. One law for all.

You are deliberately confusing rule of law with having different civil institutions. They are not the same thing. As it happens I reject that notion of bourgeois multiculturalism (faith schools and the like). As the article you cite notes, the word has other political applications and was using one of them. 

&gt;Stop being apologetic of the past and those collections of ideas that are incompatible with modern, secular and humanistic society and try to see them for what they are and no what you want them to be perceived as.

Its nothing to do with the past. We have fascist subcultures NOW. We have communist parties today. The point is that there is nothing exceptional about Islamic extremists that exposes something uniquely dangerous about the religion. They have more in common with Golden Dawn activists, say, than they do with other Muslims. Democratic society, by definition, allows radical subcultures that conspire to overthrow democracy. You cannot divorce ideas from the people that hold those ideas. Such an approach is a denial of reality. 

Islam is no more incompatible than Christianity.

Nazis were the ultimate evil. The peoples of Soviet Union, however, enlightened by the unparalleled prophetic genius of Lenin and driven by the unprecedented leadership of Stalin, triumphed over the ultimate evil. Victory in WW2 was, and always will be, the single greatest achievement of humanity, ever, and it proved, beyond all reasonable doubt, the superiority of Soviet system and Russian spirit over all others. Also, Red Army was the single greatest force for good, ever. All peoples of USSR were equal, but as Russians took the largest part in defeating the ultimate evil, they were a little bit more equal than others. This (minus the Stalin bit) was, literally, the ideology I was taught at school from the age of 6.

Next time you hear Russian sources bitching about ""rewriting history"", remember that it's pretty much a religious issue for them because _large parts of the population there still believe exactly what I wrote above_, and thus anyone not agreeing with the rather perverted soviet historiography is a heretic – or, as is the case with us poor buggers in former subject states, an apostate.

It was a convenient way for him to get away from the station and the show (which already showed its best times were beyond it. Remember the infamous 3 hour special where they did the boat trip on the Rhine? Yeah...)

I think there's 3 main reasons why anything he did since moving to ARD has tanked:

- lack of continuity (only 2-3 shows per week at random times)

- him not really giving a damn anymore. The ARD move was one big paycheck for him and I think that's all he wanted from it. Why bring in Pocher and alienate everyone who used to watch the show on Sat.1 AND the new, older ARD audience with that assclown?

- his main viewing demographic moving away from television (why would I still watch an aging, unmotivated Schmidt if I can have the Daily Show, Colbert and Conan online?). Sure, these might only be a low number compared to 1-2 million viewers but it's also people who brought in new fans through advocating his show - now no one suggests to watch Schmidt on Sat.1 but tells people to watch Jon Stewart

Basic ideals such as the notion of property start to not make sense in a libertarian world. It also sounds prone to things like the tragedy of the commons. The more I ponder it, the more even societies like Somalia offer hope.

How could you have property without the basic understanding of force? How could you be vigilant without force? Life is not fair and equal for leaving things as they are to make sense. I am born into one part of the world--say a desert lacking life or opportunity whilst you are born in a fertile part where you hold much land and never thirst for water. Why would I accept such a position? Why should I? It is likely you would have to pay me not to attack you or would have to give me something that is yours in order to abate me and my ilk.  Or you would have to slaughter those of my kind.

But then what happens when there is over population? As a libertarian world would suggest, no one has the right to limit the population of others. It is not a child's choice to come into this world. As I am left with no food, water, or opportunity, what is to become of me? It sounds as if I should be left to starve. Again, violence becomes a more intelligent, practical, and reasonable option.

The right to your property becomes the right to defend what you think is yours. Historically though, deserts and overly populated lands with little domestic opportunity have produced the best warlike societies. The Vikings chose to terrorize Europe rather than starve in the Nordic countries. The Mongols were sharpened by constant war for the limited resources of Mongolia and then chose to turn that point against other, more wealthy, nations. The Arabs swept the complacent Greco-Romans out of much of the Mediterranean world. The economic catastrophe following World War I left Germany ripe for the Nazi rise to power.

The growth of state power has, in many ways, led to a more peaceful and just world. ",0,1333087557,null,0,true,0,c46k3x8,t3_ri0i6,t1_c46k3x8,t1_c467r51,null,1428622221,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Anyway, YSK about ticket prices. They fall into two categories, the cheaper one is to book a specific train in advance. There is limited contingent available that you can book a minimum of three days and up to three months before your day of departure. Those will cost between €40 and €60 if you're very early, but international destinations get more expensive quickly.  
With regular tickets, you just take the next train when you're ready to go, but they're more expensive depending on the distance (from a couple of euros up to €125 or so). You can subscribe to BahnCard to get, depending on which one you take, 25% or 50% off, but remember to cancel it when you leave or you'll get another after a year. 25% costs €59 (€39 for students) and 50% costs €240 (€122).

true,[deleted],null,null,"What you said earlier contradicts what you are saying now. 7 billion individual nations vs two nations now. The idea that everyone can be their own nation, their own sovereign, yet still form cohesive nation states with laws they all agree upon and follow is also based on ""not much actual evidence."" The study of history also suggests that the rise of centralized state power has been overwhelmingly a *good* thing for humanity. There are few examples where an increase in society's prosperity has not led to centralization and the development of hierarchy of some sort. This is true in politics, in business, in science, et cetera. Industries that meet with success tend to concentrate near each other (Silicon Valley for technology, Guangdong for manufacturing, the American Northeast for elite education, the consolidation of global banks primarily in NYC and London). The development of centralized power--of state power--is a sign of success. The scattering of power--or the increase of individual freedom--is a sign of strife, turmoil, and generally not of 'success.'

This kind of centralization applies to societies as well. As nations become successful, they typically give more power to their government who then uses that power to, by and large, actually improve their quality of life. A well-governed nation provides an environment that is conducive to prosperity. A well-governed nation necessarily forces its peace and laws upon those who do not follow them. When a nation lacks the ability to force its citizens to pay taxes, you know the nation is in turmoil. For if there are not taxes, there is rarely safety. If there are not taxes, education crumbles. If there are not taxes, basic infrastructure such as roads and the ability to provide water, electricity, fall into disrepair. When infrastructure falls into disrepair, education crumbles, and one's sense of safety deteriorates, a society begins to fade.

I would argue two separate facts in recent history are linked together.  The first being that government power has increased tremendously around the world to unprecedented levels over the past 60 years.

true,[deleted],null,null,"From where you are to most of the international destinations, fly.  Germanwings, Air Berlin, Flyniki, and others offer good, cheap, reliable tickets.  You're best off with city airports with good public rail transport connections (most of them, actually).  Check how long it would take you from airport to city center.  My rule of thumb is that anything requiring over 3-4 hours by high speed train is often much more comfortable by air.  

Within (most) of Germany, take the train.  Particularly ICEs are excellent and comfortable, and inter-city trains have reasonable on-board restaurants.  Book well in advance as the fees are an incredible jungle.  The advantage is that you'll generally leave from and arrive in the city center, and your ticket price is up front. 

Avoid Ryanair like the plague, unless you know exactly that the airports they serve are where you actually want to go.  They have a habit of naming their airports after supposedly nearby cities - but are nowhere close (e.g. Frankfurt =&gt; Hahn).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; is Spain going the same way?

It depends on how the government handles everything. But, easy put, if both unemployment and prices do not stop to rise (oh, well, followed by cuts in health and education) things will get ugly.

&gt; What do you Spanish people think about the EU?

What I see, there are two fronts (in fact, now I see 4) in the EU.

* Mediterranean / Atlantic countries: Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain. Yes, they call us the ""PIGS"". These countries were, in fact, ancient Europe. It's popular to say that we are just shit countries that like not paying taxes, and that deserve everything it's happening. It's so sad the current situation of Greece. People is talking about kicking Greece from the EU. Greece **is** Europe.

* Center European: the countries that have more enforcement on what happens on the EU (founding countries?). For me, France and Germany (Other countries on that region are just used as a tax heaven (Luxembourg), or just don't fucking care about it. Decisions come from here. I don't like how Germany (as in EU) puts certain limits on other countries. Merkel says, Spain does, even if it does not make sense if you want to grow as a country.

* Nordic countries: These are really protected countries. With less immigration and density, stable economy, and natural resources. Kudos to them. I see them abandoning the EU as soon as possible. Also, they are putting money, and nobody seems to thank them enough.

* East countries: Places where it's easy and less costly to invest money in (similar to what happened in Spain when entered the EU).

From my spaniard POV: since we entered the EU large sums of moneys started entering, and so, public waste started to go like crazy. Since that, we have been living a life we can not afford. It's all been an illusion. Moreover, with all that influx of lend money, there wasn't a need to improve our economy, so most growth as a country has gone to the service sector (which is seasonal and unstable).

That, also (in my mind) explains why the countries forming the PIGS are, in a cynical point of view, just a leisure park for Europe.

Every time there has been a right wing government, people has been selling itself to foreign investors. That, gives instant influx of money. On the downsides, you will find 5 years later thinking what the fuck just happened.

Now, I know this is a really picky subject to discuss (money is involved), so I am sorry if I have offended anyone with my generalizations. I just don't like how media is portraying everything, and people get mixed feelings. I think media is just perpetuating hate between us.",0,1333111535,null,0,false,0,c46m487,t3_rjv80,t1_c46m487,t3_rjv80,null,1428623153,2,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,2

* Cozy and cool little bar smack in the middle of things. [The Viertelbar](http://www.viertelbar.de/).

* [The Cafe Congo](http://www.google.com/maps?q=cafe+congo+wuppertal&amp;ll=51.255771,7.135942&amp;spn=0.003606,0.009956&amp;sll=51.255863,7.135916&amp;layer=c&amp;cid=524287967762754030&amp;cbp=13,11.02,,0,4.23&amp;panoid=HfvukylSvlirUeI6MQJxjQ&amp;hq=cafe+congo+wuppertal&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;cbll=51.255773,7.135946) is a weird one - great and varying ethnic food, interesting people, bands playing, etc.

* If you need a Haircut, [Hair Schmidt](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=hair+schmidt&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.280327,7.031727&amp;spn=0.230642,0.637207&amp;sll=51.206393,6.93491&amp;sspn=0.231013,0.637207&amp;t=w&amp;gl=de&amp;hq=hair+schmidt&amp;z=11&amp;iwloc=A) is a wonderful place.

* Hanging out after school or after a shopping trip, [Milia's Coffee](http://www.daswuppertal.de/milias/indexh.php) is a friendly and amazing coffee place. (There's a really *gemütlich* little enclave in the back with couches)
* [Cafe Extrablatt](http://www.cafe-extrablatt.com/cms/front_content.php?idcat=860&amp;standort_id=51) has Cocktail Happy-hour Mondays and Thursdays starting 8pm, as well as an [all-you-can-eat brunch buffet on the weekends](http://www.cafe-extrablatt.com/cms/Wuppertal-Elberfeld/News---Termine/aktuell/Brunch-Buffet-.html).

* There's an old abandoned train route [going over a viaduct in Wuppertal Barmen](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=Wuppertal+Barmen&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=51.272646,7.194372&amp;spn=0.000901,0.002489&amp;sll=51.261181,7.162903&amp;sspn=0.115369,0.318604&amp;t=w&amp;hnear=Barmen+Wuppertal&amp;z=19). Last time I was there they tried putting up fences, but you can find your way up there easily, not only is the view over Barmen fantastic, but there's also wonderfully creepy tunnel nearby, [covered in graffiti](http://www.panoramio.com/photo/31557003) of the world-famous artists Os Gemeos &amp; Nina during [a Streetart-stunt in 2006](http://www.outsides.de/downloads/we-come-at-night-preview.pdf). Bring a flashlight.

* [The Holsteiner Rainbow stairs](http://ellavez.blogspot.de/2011/02/rainbow-holsteiner-stairs-in-wuppertal.html) are a little bit of a walk, [but worth a visit](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Holsteiner+Treppe,+Elberfeld+42107+Wuppertal,+D%C3%BCsseldorf,+Nordrhein-Westfalen,+Germany&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.264919,7.147824&amp;spn=0.001803,0.004978&amp;geocode=FbQ9DgMdOxFtAA&amp;hnear=Holsteiner+Treppe,+42107+Wuppertal,+D%C3%BCsseldorf,+Nordrhein-Westfalen,+Germany&amp;t=h&amp;z=18).

I used GermanWings and AirBerlin quite a bit. 
The newsletters will often have weekend specials ~20 euros to other countries. I visited Spain, Italy, Poland, Denmark, etc this way.

In Germany, the trains are great and the ICE is especially fast considering an hour flight usually requires you be there an hour or two in advance. If doing the train thing, sign up for a BahnCard 25 trial (which you can cancel) or outright purchase a BahnCard 50 and every train ticket on DeutscheBahn will be 25,50% off. Be careful though as this does not apply to city transports. Also, if traveling with friends, the trains are much more comfortable and interactive, you can reserve seats with a table so you can chat/play games or you can hit the dining car and share a beer on your trip.
