true,rpad,null,null,"The constitution in effect was the ""Communist Constitution"" which was made in 1949. Then in 1989 it was heavily changed, to allow for parliamentary democracy and liberal human rights. It was named the ""Temporary Constitution"", since in its preamble stood a single provison: ""the new parliament shall accept a final constitution"". 

Historically (and politically) this step in 1989 had its reasons. The politicians should have made a new constitution then, but the political situation was not stable. It was even envisioned, that the communists still have such a power, hat they could overturn the acceptance of a new constitution. And that would have been terrible. Imagine a communist country making a regime change, dropping communism, and then people on a referendum vote to overturn a new constitution, practically reverting the country back into communism. That is why the old constitution was changed, and no new constitution was made. That is also the reason, why a referendum is not needed for a new constitution. Non-commie politicians feared in 1989 that a referendum would overturn the changes. They even had the same fear now, so that is why this new constitution was not put to referendum. So there was a consensus (at least on the non-commie political side) and a provision in the old constitution, that a new constitution should be made. In 1994 the socialists and the liberals who made a pact with them, had a 2/3 majority in the parliament, they could have finalized the constitution, but it was more suiting for them to keep the old one.

This however was not mandatory, the country could have gone on with the old one too. Its mostly symbolic that the name of the country does not resemble the name it had during communism any more, and it is not a rewritten communist constitution made under soviet pressure, but a newly made. The symbolism is hurting those who have sympathies for the old commie elite. They see this as return to pre-WWII Hungary (or even the Kingdom of Hungary) traditions. There is truth in that, even if only symbolically, the new constitution tries to erase all links to traditions of communist Hungary, and establish historic continuity to pre-communist Hungary. One side sees this positively, the other sees this as the end of the world.

There was a consensus that the country needs reform of the other laws. The constitutional court ruled, that the election law has to changes, since there are huge differences in election district sizes, then new law guarantees the the biggest difference can be only 15% in district size. There are other changes as well, the parliamentary election will only have a single turn, there will be only 199 representatives. There was also a consensus that the media law needs changing. Previous parliaments tried to push trough changes, but fragmentation of the politics (and the deals that went with that) prevented a majority to form. The chaos also suited one specific party, which had indirect control over the media. ",0,1325667395,null,0,false,0,c3dsetc,t3_o1gn6,t1_c3dsetc,t1_c3drxlx,null,1428121186,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

I am not a lawyer. The following is not legal advice.

What your landlord got was probably an *Abmahnung*, which is just about the same thing as a cease-and-desist letter.

This Abmahnung declares that your landlord is suspected of *distributing* copyrighted material unlawfully and demands a *Unterlassungserklärung*, that is, a declaration that you will not do it again. The letter probably contains a template for this Unterlassungserklärung. You should **never** use this template because it goes a lot further than what you are legally required to.

Your landlord has several options:

1. Do nothing. **don't do that.**
2. Sign the template and send it back, but not pay the fees. **don't do that either**
3. Sign the template and send it back and pay the fees **don't do that either**

true,hungarian_redditor,HUNG,Hungary,"Here's a simple explanation. It all began with the introduction of the euro: it made interest rates fall to unprecedented lows in southern European countries. And that encouraged a debt-fuelled boom. Not only the governments built up huge debts but the private sector as well. 

All that debt helped finance more and more imports. Meanwhile, Germany became an export power-house, selling far more to the rest of the world (including southern Europeans) than it was buying as imports. That meant Germany was earning a lot of surplus cash on its exports. And guess what - most of that cash ended up being lent to southern Europe.

But debts are only part of the problem. During the boom years, wages rose and rose in the south (and in France). But German unions agreed to hold their wages steady. So Italian and Spanish workers now face a huge competitive price disadvantage. Indeed, this loss of competitiveness is the main reason why southern Europeans have been finding it so much harder to export than Germany.

Here You'll find everything You need to know on how to handle the problem. The general principles are:
1. DON'T admit to anything, DON'T pay anything. If You admit, the letters will keep on coming and the situation will become serious.
2. Read the FAQ on the webpage!
3. Once You've read everything, check and fill the document in the download section (modifizierte Unterlassungsverpflichtungserklärung) and send it to the lawyer company that sent You the letter. DON'T listen to people that tell You not to respond. In Germany, if somebody accuses You of something, remaining quiet not a good approach from a legal perspective.
4. If You want to - hire a lawyer. Personally I woudn't do that immediately, only if the letters keep on comming after sending the mod. UE, but that's Your call.
5. You'll be fine. If they're going to go to court with this (and most likely they won't if You do everything right), the maximum of what they can charge You is 100 EUR (this is defined by law) plus the amount equal to loss of profit due to illegal download (the cost of the CD, most likely a couple of euros).

As does much of the rest of europe but not all it should be pointed out, much of northern europe appears capable of sharing the same currency as Germany just not all of europe.

true,rpad,null,null,"Not completely true. The mayor of Budapest (who is not even a Fidesz member, never was) appointed a new director to a theater. There is nothing wrong with the background of that one person, even if he had not much experience in managing a theater. He promised on showing plays of Hungarian authors. Which again is a commendable thing, Hungarian theaters prefer pieces of Hungarian authors, as a Danish theater would prefer Danish authors, everyone is responsible for maintaining their own cultural heritage. This is the part which would have gone trough without any problems, even with the liberals lurking around.

Then there is a (former) screenplay writer by the name István Csurka. During the communist years he was a pretty good screenplay writer, had a couple of outstanding pieces. After the communism, he went into politics, first into a Center-Conservative party, then when that party almost fell apart, he went to the far-right and founded his own party. To this day, he maintains his own far-right newspaper (freedom of press in Hungary FTW), and expresses his not-quite politically correct, mostly anti-semitic views.

Csurka was selected by the said freshly appointed theater director to be his deputy, i presume with the intention of bringing some of Csurka's old plays to the theater. That was when the left-liberals lost their temper and started protesting. Just a funny note to this story is that when Csurka was in politics, the left-liberals wished ""he went back to the theater, he was doing that better."" Nevertheless the whole story became a huge hysteria.

The mayor of Budapest asked Csurka to cease his anti-semitic news-production. But he didn't, and now the mayor asked the director to remove Csurka from the theater. 

I guess the story ends here. The odd thing about this is that the mayor of Budapest was presented all over the world as some kind of nazi governor, who is killing off liberal culture, and replacing it with anti-semitism. While he himself never decided on employing Csurka. And actually he is one of the ""milder"" politicians, as i already wrote, he is not a Fidesz party member, he became mayor of Budapest as an independent, but with Fidesz supporting him.

first: don't admit anything to the people who sent the letter. basically the letter they sent your landlord says ""we have seen your ip torrenting this song / cd and if you pay 1200€ and promise to never do it again we wont sue you"". but they can't prove who torrented it and the ip isn't 100% sure sign, so depending on how good your lawyer is and how the judge's mood is on that day it's possible (but unlikely) that they loose.


second: usually they send a so called ""unterlassungserklärung"" for you (or in this case your landlord) to sign. DON'T SIGN THAT. the one they send you says ""i did it and won't do it again"" what you want is one that says ""i don't admit anything, but i wont torrent"".


best thing to do is to have your landlord contact a lawyer specialised in media rights to help him with the ""unterlassungserklärung"" and to negotiate with the other lawyers. usually the money they want is way overpriced and a good lawyer should be able to get them down a few hundred euro at least.

there are sites who offer free consultation from a lawyer. you leave them your number and they will call you and tell you what you can do and offer their services.


also: if you torrented more files, it is possible that you will recieve more of those letters, you can prevent that by sending all the other lawyers who send these ""abmahnungen"" (the so called ""abmahn-mafia"") letters saying you will never make anything belonging to their clients publicly available. those letters are called ""präventive unterlassungserklärungen"". ask the lawyer you are consulting about those.",0,1325700886,null,0,false,0,c3dvwdc,t3_o2hkw,t1_c3dvwdc,t3_o2hkw,null,1428122835,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

Big talk for someone being schooled.  Let's have a looksy shall we?

&gt;&gt;That's not who's migrating to France, they are people who say for themselves that it is to capitalise on gains on their UK property and the strong pound.

&gt;This makes no sense, my illiterate friend. 

Well putting 'illiterate' to one side for now because I think it will come back to haunt you (and coming from someone that had to have the fact that I was agreeing with you, and that you were agreeing with my initial points in two consecutive comments, but that I was seeing it from the other perspective before you decided to drop it)

The point makes complete sense.  Those moving to France and such countries with a weaker currency are clear in that they do so in part to capitalise on the weaker currency and to make the most of the gains they'd made on property and income earned in a stronger currency.  

It's simple and straight forward.  It's actively happening.  It has happened.  It's what the Spanish economy was built on before it joined the Euro; people with a much stronger currency and buying value than the Peseta driving development.

&gt; So your whole argument that the stronger currency will buy property easier and hence cause the rise of the prices is not exclusive for the weaker currencies.

Who said it was exclusively the reason?  I certainly didn't.  I simply stated that if you have a million Britons in Spain, or several hundred thousand in France, buying properties then there are going to be whole regions having their prices driven up by those with a strong currency.

&gt;SO you admit that you don't know the specific numbers, right ? Then, even if you isolate my statement (the one about hundrends of thousands) you still are not right since you are not specific. 

The specific numbers are changing all the time.  You said it would take people moving in their thousands.  I simply showed that it was people moving in their hundreds of thousands each year.  If you argue that for the effect to happen would take thousands and then you are shown it happens to that extent plus to a factor of 100 at least, then you have conceded the point.

&gt;&gt;British buyers represent 11 per cent of the market (after Portuguese and French expat buyers) and although still at **a low** level, sales to South Africans, Australians, New Zealanders and **Americans** are rising, largely due to favourable exchange rates

&gt;Thanks for that, didn't see it. You just added another counter point : ""low"". Hindsight = 0 isn't it?

I told you the illiterate thing would come back to bite you.  The article says that the relative low level applies to Americans (South Africans, Australians, New Zealanders), not that the British with the strong pound are at a low level.  Who were we talking about again?  That's right, the British with their strong pound.

You simply didn't read it right.

&gt;&gt;From the same article:

&gt;&gt;Back in France, however, housing investors — especially those in Paris — are still loving life. The reason: price gains in 2010 pushed the median square-foot price in the capital to over $650 for the first time ever — a level that's set to increase to $742 within a year. Though it's difficult to make an accurate comparison with larger and far more diverse housing markets, existing numbers suggest Paris is creeping closer to the prices seen in notoriously expensive London and New York City. But experts warn that isn't necessarily a good thing.

&gt;More here : 

&gt;&gt;r — and which will only get tighter until both government and developers summon the will, and the finances, to build more homes.

&gt;So this isn't cause and effect. The cause isn't the foreigner's buying power.

Nobody said it was the sole cause.  You simply just argued two points that I've already made, one of which you said at the start of this post that ""makes no sense, my illiterate friend.""  Well, I said that people in the UK capitalised on the stronger currency and the strength of property in the UK, you've just shown the French capitalising on the strength of their property increases in the same sense - arguing part of what I've just said, which you called 'illiterate'.

I also said that the French government were having to encourage new builds to compensate for the influx outpricing people with a weaker currency...you just highlighted the article I provided arguing just that!  There is government policy to encourage new builds to counter the effect I'd described.

&gt;LOL AT THIS ONE. Now, it isn't a big suprise really. It comes from the telegraph. Cute story but doesn't answer shit. . You are spamming articles because your argument per se is weak.

Ad hominem.  Are you really arguing that expats are lying to The Telegraph, or that The Telegraph is making it up that expats leave for their home shores when their own earnings reach a closer parity to their new countries?

They move when their GBP pensions and fixed dividends have greater purchasing parity overseas, something you've already argued, now you're arguing they aren't moving back when the purchasing parity isn't what it was.

&gt;Lol wut. You are pathetic.

Eloquent. It was in response to this: ""Instead, like the British press, they simply quote estate agents who say that les Anglais in France have stopped buying, and started selling.""

It's pathetic to link to estate agents in France saying that when the UK currency weakened they started selling - substantiating what I've said all along!

&gt;You misunderstood me.

I bet it happens to you a lot!  It was in reference to you saying that it was a 6 line article and me saying you had to click the 'read more' button.

&gt;The article referring to the cause and effect was essentially 6 sentences with no proof. The ""read on"" option expands the page with a bunch of statistics describing the population.

REALLY?  

            ""More than 198,000 British nationals moved overseas 
            last year, bringing the total number of Brits abroad 
            to more than 5.5 million, according to new research 
            from the Institute for Public Policy Research, published 
            today (Monday). The report says that a strong economy
            at home has encouraged emigration and that very few 
            Britons leave because they think ‘the country has gone
            to the dogs’.""

That's just the next paragraph...there's another NINE, and then a whole load of facts, statistics and sources, something you rejected it for not having!!!  Something you dismissed as A SIX LINE ARTICLE!!!  LoL.  Even when told to open it up you still fail to scroll down as the article continues.

&gt;First i talked about prices and salary. You didn't give me those. Secondly, you appeal to anecdotal evidence. Tell me how many expats are saying this. N00B

If you could read the links you'd hear that's exactly what you've been shown.

&gt;Your case is hopeless. Everytime you post and try to mask your ignorance and stupidity with irrelevant links and premises, defunct arguments based on said premises and anecdotal evidence, a few more of my brain cells fade away. You are what the internet subculture would call : a fucktard.

Sassy.

Did I fail to mention that I'm back from the UK now?  That's right.  I'm one of those very people you have tried to argue can't capitalise from a stronger currency who is, has, and continues to capitalise on a stronger currency.

I made you wait for 2 weeks; but it was fun watching you argue against even your own points seeing it only from a unipolar perspective.

The change to central bank law, which is not accepted by the EU commission, and to which the government wants to stick is not that major. There was already one round, where most of the EU objections were accepted, and the new text was submitted. The EU wants to see all things guaranteed in front, my guess is that they are seeing too much flame around lawmaking in Hungary, even tho no issue was that serious as the socialists presented it. The change is to have a third vice president to the central bank appointed by the government. In reality this third VP would do as the central bank president orders, so the boss would remains the boss, and the central bank remains independent. But even that is just a possibility, there is no ""third VP"" assigned to the central bank. So from one day to another, nothing really changed in regards to the central bank. 

The reason why the forint has taken a dive, is because there will be talks with IMF and the EU, about a safety-loan. And those talks are not going on in a too friendly manner. But it is not apparent if a weak forint is good or bad.

There are two ways:

Strong Forint:
Foreign debt can be paid back,
Import is cheap,
Labor is expensive

Weak forint:
Defaults on foreign loans,
Import is expensive,
Labor is cheap

The central bank is opposing the devaluation of the forint. If there is a reason for influencing the central bank, it would be that reason. But since the CB wont budge, the current push-pull tactic is already devaluing the forint, although with more collateral damage. Partly it is bad, is because there is certain amount of state debt (mostly from local governments, towns) in foreign currency, and that will have to be paid off by the central state too. 

It was already decided that ""not all banks will make it"". Much of Hungarian foreign debt is from Austrian and German banks. While i could go on about their unfair lending practices in the past, that is the past. The point is that they have losses. This has reached the degree, that they are now more concerned than those who have the debt. Devaluing the forint would not affect the single Hungarian bank, since it almost exclusively only has forint loans. There is a campaign going on to pay off (or convert) foreign currency loans to forint loans, it resulted in more people applying that expected. After such a write-off we cannot expect good PR from anyone, in regards to economy, democracy or anything else.

The biggest thing that causes problems, i think, in relation to EU talks, is that the EU demands that Hungary does not do any more ""creative"" debt reductions on its own. But if the EU stuffs Hungary with more loans, that doesn't solve anything, just worsens the situation. The ECB should go on and directly finance the EU states, thus making the money markets irrelevant. Not saying Hungary (as a non Euro state) would qualify for that, but it would be a viable way out.

Another point is that (i'm no economist, and i don't have statistics to back this up) but Hungary seems to be transforming into ""labor serving"" German companies, in Hungary or in Germany. Germany and Austria has opened its labor markets last may, and from what i see, it has ""eaten up"" the worthiest part of the Hungarian labor force. The only thing that currently matters in Hungary, if you want to work, is that you should know German. In such an economy, the only things that matter is the EUR/HUF ratio, and how many EUR flows into Hungary from people working in Germany. German and Austrian companies are paying in EUR, and a weak forint means that Hungarian labor can be paid cheaply, and the money they bring back into the country ""feeds a lot of local people"". That is why it is good that taxes were reduced, so that people working abroad are paying their taxes in Hungary and not in Germany or Austria. This is a big paradigm shift in Hungary, and it will become even more important in the future, as current news show that German unemployment is historically low, which means that there are jobs which cannot be satisfied by the locals, and the missing workforce is drawn from Hungary (as from the other central-European countries too).

I made a post about it not so long ago, but believe me when I tell you that portuguese healthcare is actually one of the few decent things this country has.

The official inflation doesn't take into account that because the government changed the way it's calculated. Wages may have grown but not enough to catch up with the actual increase in the cost of living. Obviously, the conversion from pts to euros in the wages was made with the correct exchange rate. The net effect is that people can buy less stuff than before.

true,OneSalientOversight,AUST,Australia,"One of the themes in this article is the need for prices to rise in order to inflate the overall debt away. This is a common belief now arising within the economics community (including Krugman).

My own pov is that any deviance away from price stability is bad - whether it is increasing inflation or increasing deflation. Having this pov is a little axiomatic, but my opinion is that money reaches it maximum potential usage when it retains value over the long term - which, to me, is zero inflation (neither inflation nor deflation over the long term - the price index remains averaging 100 over the long term). This is quite radical, of course, and there are deeper reasons why I believe that this should be the case but that's not what I'm commenting about here.

So to me, any talk of inflating debt away is anathema because inflation is bad and using bad policy to solve bad policy is itself bad policy.

Nevertheless I do recognise that debt needs to be reduced - not just government debt but also market debt. It is this debt which is causing a solvency crisis within modern industrialised countries like America and members of the EU.

So I have multiple alternative suggestions.

For Europe, I would transfer all government debt into a single entity backed by the EU and ECB. This entity would then institute an EU-wide Tobin Tax upon financial transactions. The debt would then be paid off by the revenue supplied by the Tobin tax. 

For the US, I would use further quantitative easing from the Fed to fund the creation of multiple brand new commercial banks. These banks would not only be flush with funds but will have no liquidity or solvency problems at all, thus encouraging more and more lending. At the same time, zombie banks would be gradually closed down and declared insolvent. Initially these banks would be owned by the US government but the legislation would force an eventual IPO over time (say 2-3 years of operation).",0,1325710466,null,0,false,0,c3dxmxw,t3_o2fkw,t1_c3dxmxw,t3_o2fkw,null,1428123648,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,mstfuplx,GREE,Greece,"&gt;The point makes complete sense. Those moving to France and such countries with a weaker currency are clear in that they do so in part to capitalise on the weaker currency and to make the most of the gains they'd made on property and income earned in a stronger currency.
It's simple and straight forward. It's actively happening. It has happened. It's what the Spanish economy was built on before it joined the Euro; people with a much stronger currency and buying value than the Peseta driving development.

No proof here. As i said before it is one of the advantages of a stronger currency. We were discussing about a specific point that you thought i conceded. 

&gt;Who said it was exclusively the reason? I certainly didn't. I simply stated that if you have a million Britons in Spain, or several hundred thousand in France, buying properties then there are going to be whole regions having their prices driven up by those with a strong currency.

Million britons in Spain ? When ? For which purpose ? What salaries do they have. What the fuck again.

&gt;The specific numbers are changing all the time. You said it would take people moving in their thousands. I simply showed that it was people moving in their hundreds of thousands each year. If you argue that for the effect to happen would take thousands and then you are shown it happens to that extent plus to a factor of 100 at least, then you have conceded the point.

You have completely ignored everything i have been writing the last 4 replies. Why do you do that, honestly?

&gt;Ad hominem. Are you really arguing that expats are lying to The Telegraph, or that The Telegraph is making it up that expats leave for their home shores when their own earnings reach a closer parity to their new countries?
They move when their GBP pensions and fixed dividends have greater purchasing parity overseas, something you've already argued, now you're arguing they aren't moving back when the purchasing parity isn't what it was.

A weaker currency is not by itself sufficient to be exploited. You need to tell me what buying power as a whole those people have to infer how they will affect the market. You still haven't done that. That's why i view this discussion almost useless. 

&gt;REALLY?
        ""More than 198,000 British nationals moved overseas 
        last year, bringing the total number of Brits abroad 
        to more than 5.5 million, according to new research 
        from the Institute for Public Policy Research, published 
        today (Monday). The report says that a strong economy
        at home has encouraged emigration and that very few 
        Britons leave because they think ‘the country has gone
        to the dogs’.""

true,EuroTreasure,NORW,Norway,"I am from a country that is not a member (Norway), but has reached a integration where it practically is a member in many senses. 

Actually, Norway implements more EU directives than the EU-average and does it quicker than the said average.

So Norway has been transformed by the European project as other European nations.

Everytime I hear something on the news that national politicians are barred doing something by EU directives, it is ALWAYS for the better.

A have a very concrete example:
The Norwegian goverment operates a quasi-govermental company that operates airports (Avinor), the system is structured in a way that the main airports in Norway subsidises remote smaller airports, which is why Gardemoen Oslo is extremly expensive, while you can fly to the north of Norway to a region with 10 000 people.

A group of investors in my local area wanted to take an old military airbase and make it a private airport that caters to the Oslo-metropolitan area. This would break the Avinor-monopoly and the state did everything it could to stop this venture. Luckily there the Bolkestein-directive which made them win in the courts. EU saves the day. Breaking up the protectionism. Breaking monopolies. Liberalizing the industries. We sure need that.

Most people in my country does not care much for the EU, because they love the percieved freedom from the EU, while having all the benefits. A Norwegian membership is not on the horizon, but when it is, I will vote ""Yes"". The two biggest parties in Norway, the Social Democrats and the Liberal-Conservatives are both very Pro-EU and together they have about 60% of the electorate. It's only a matter of time, but it may very well take decades.

It all boils down to this. What a abstract model state should look like, as agreed upon by the European nations, is far better than any concrete state in Europe today, or in the world. It is therefore beneficial for anyone to join the EU and streamline its state-functions and integrate its markets.

As for Croatia, it is doubly important to integrate into Europe given the recent history in F. Yugoslavia. Serbs, Croats and Bosnians will be the best of friends when they trade together and will be able to sell their goods easily to its other neighbours. It's a new paradigm, far from the ethnocentric tribalism of the past.

Exactly what I've been telling you. I've since told you I know from experience. People in Spain know it. People in France know it. British people capitalising on the weakness of the Euro (and the hither to strength of the UK property market), and before that weaker currencies, has been HUGE!

I like the part where you ignore the salaries. But whatever, i have come to accept your failures. By the way, as for the millions of Britons in Spain part : It has nothing to do with the property prices. You haven't proved that yet. Besides, i asked you for proof in a certain context. 

&gt;Or you could just say I've ripped every reply open, quoted it, and showed your ignorance and illiteracy!
Muwahahahaha

That would have been true, if i was the ignorant one. Rofl, you failed again.


&gt;Never said it was - you simply stated that a weaker currency brings investment, migration, and encourages export - which I all agreed to simply adding that I'd rather be the one investing, moving to exploit purchasing strength, and being able to buy more, consume more!

Good Lord, back to square one i see. If you have never said it, then why do you keep insisting ? Where are your proofs. Cause and effect dummy.

&gt;You already conceded that point.
You said that for the effect to happen would take thousands; we're now talking in terms of hundreds of thousands, millions over years even.

So cute :) You are obviously trying too hard. I have already debunked everything you have linked and stated on this point and you still delude yourself. Actually, i think you know in what a shitty situation you are but you have an ego to save, amirite?

&gt;No cause and effect? Even the headline says, *Strong pound and booming house prices help Brits move abroad"", and everything thereafter is to support it.

That's not cause and effect. Because the article made a statement and it didn't provide the mechanism. Wtf, this is elementary school debate. Get spanked more.

&gt;Fail.
FAIL.
EPIC FAIL.

Why are you talking about yourself again?

&gt;Thank you for accepting it AT LAST. There's only MILLIONS of us doing it. 

Way to respond off context. Then again, you have already done it a million times. Possible reasons :

a) Stupidity
b) Weakness 

Tut, tut, tut

&gt;I will. Very first post I said to you was that I agreed that I was doing that (had to keep saying it for it to sink with you though), my whole point, from the start, has been I'd rather be the one with the stronger currency than the weak.

Rofl check the above answer. Thanks for giving money to the ""weaker"" countries. 

&gt;No, not really. Best of both worlds with fixed dividends and a subsidiary income in pounds and with a bank account still in the UK. My whole point from the start. As it goes some things are still cheaper, so it is a best of both worlds for those WILLING TO CAPITALISE ON A STRONG CURRENCY AND LIVE WITH A FOOT IN BOTH STATES....as I've been arguing.

Rofl, you butthurt. The article you linked stated that not me. 

&gt;I actually provided all the content &amp; links...you're simply being a sounding board to it. You've provided none yourself. Again. Go back and look.

Links without content. You do understand your own language right ? 

&gt;Oh, you're so raging just now in your ineptitude.
Go on. Tell me I can't capitalise on a strong currency again after just having a 2 week holiday (because of the weaker currency, if it holds, there should be another four 1-2 week holidays this year) and when the monthly transfer this month/last month is going to be more than it has been for years!
Please. Do it. Tell me I'm not capitalising on it...

true,AgentOfMisdirection,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;But that is a false. I explained it to you again and again. It is one thing a stronger currency and another purchasing power.

AND I AGREED, but where a stronger currency comes with purchasing power (as your own link argues) people from the stronger stand to capitalise: it is you that said a weaker currency meant more people investing, being tourists and I AGREED...but clearly the people moving and investing are doing so because the weaker currency means they have stronger buying power.  I simply stated better to be the stronger, the investor, the tourist.

You can't have it both ways.  I already agreed a weaker currency would encourage exports, tourism, investment and migration.  I simply stated that those moving, investing, visiting, because of a weaker currency, they doing so would also have greater purchasing power otherwise they couldn't do it, and I would far rather be they.

You also asked how a stronger currency could continue having buying power, and I explained how developed economies actually work, have worked, are working, and how it is an observable economic event.

&gt;...as for the millions of Britons in Spain... 

So you accept that where you said it would take thousands for the economic effect I explained, that premise has now been met.

&gt;That would have been true, if i was the ignorant one. Rofl, you failed again.

In response to me not addressing your points.  Did I not just quote your response?  Yes I did.  Did you not just concede that there are millions where earlier you said it would only take thousands to effect?  Yes you did.  Did you just misread a link, again, and have to be shown fault in your comprehension?  Sadly, yes.  For the second time you quickly moved on when you noticed your mistake.

&gt;If you have never said it, then why do you keep insisting ? Where are your proofs. Cause and effect dummy.

                purchasing strength, and being able to buy more, 
                consume more!


How do I need proof to show WHAT I would rather do?  I'd rather be the investor, the landlord, the one with the disposable income to be a tourist,...if you'd rather be the owned, the tenant, the waiter to the tourist that's up to you.  I don't require you to provide me proof of what you'd rather, I just need you to get me my G&amp;T from the bar I own speedily otherwise I'll put your rent up!

Oh yeah.  People are buying second homes and holiday homes, buying mortgage free properties and releasing their capital, extending their savings and improving their quality of life because they are either a) stupid, or b) weak

Maybe they're doing it because they get better, more.  That they're capitalising!

Ahhh.  So English isn't your first.  

Explains a lot.  Leaves more questions unanswered though.  How could you have not known that there had been  a massive middle class exodus of the British to the EU to capitalise on their comparable wealth with the strength of the pound?  After all you said it would take thousands to exact the influence I was talking about, and I struggle to see how a continental European couldn't know that to be already the case...

Keep in mind that as we hit natural limits on available resources and they in turn get disputed by developing nations and in a globalized market (see peak oil, food, water, metals), these frailties are becoming rather evident. 

Also, the world cannot sustain a westernized ecological footprint and as more and more families in developing economies step into middle class, the consumerism (basis for our capitalist societies) adds immense strain on already dwindling resources. 

But also, add global warming, naked derivatives, unregulated markets, rampant corruption and conflicts of interests amongst officials and you get a much grimmer picture.

b) You keep clinging on the fact that i didn't fully read the article. I thought we were done with this. 

c) Your last statement makes no sense. Where do you base it on.

&gt;In response to me not addressing your points. Did I not just quote your response? Yes I did. Did you not just concede that there are millions where earlier you said it would only take thousands to effect? Yes you did. Did you just misread a link, again, and have to be shown fault in your comprehension? Sadly, yes. For the second time you quickly moved on when you noticed your mistake.

It is one thing to quote and another to respond to the content. If logic worked like that everyone would be a mensa member. Again, i didn't concede. I referred to the ""hundrends and thousands"" in context which you didn't address.

&gt;How do I need proof to show WHAT I would rather do? I'd rather be the investor, the landlord, the one with the disposable income to be a tourist,...if you'd rather be the owned, the tenant, the waiter to the tourist that's up to you.

Problem is that the premise ""if ... you"" is not true. I will also be the banker, a company and any entitiy that a financial reality contains. It is not like i am a slave. Besides, i will make money from your spending and visit some other country, yours or not (matters not), and receive the same services. 

&gt;You also asked how a stronger currency could continue having buying power, and I explained how developed economies actually work, have worked, are working, and how it is an observable economic event.

I didn't ask how a stronger currency will survive. That is not the point of conflict. 

&gt; I simply stated that those moving, investing, visiting, because of a weaker currency, they doing so would also have greater purchasing power otherwise they couldn't do it, and I would far rather be they. 

Not to the point though that it will make the local people's lives miserable and difficult. 

&gt;We appreciate your investments

This was said in a sarcastic way and shouldn't be taken literally.

&gt;Ahhh. So English isn't your first.
Explains a lot. Leaves more questions unanswered though. 

Irrelevant, distracting and deceiving questions, for the influence is not proven(in said context) and i will not give you that answer.

Oh....so you retract the first remark then.  Course it has affect on your remark, read the headline!  The whole article rams roughshod over your remark.

&gt;Ofcourse they will do that. 

So neither a) stupid or, b) weak then.  Second point you made in that post refuted.

That's 3 things.

a)  Which is why I referenced other replies, namely your first.

b)  You just said you didn't read the article because you didn't click the READ MORE LINK

c)  The article you just dissed, ad hominem, as being 'The Telegraph', despite the Telegraph loving to be the ones overlording it to the EU, not marking an exodus.  Keep up, read the links.  Oh the irony given your (b).

&gt;It is one thing to quote and another to respond to the content. If logic worked like that everyone would be a mensa member. Again, i didn't concede. I referred to the ""hundrends and thousands"" in context which you didn't address.

Leave MENSA to those that stand a chance.  You said it would take hundreds and thousands. I showed you hundreds OF thousands, on year, even millions.

You already conceded this.

&gt;Problem is that the premise ""if ... you"" is not true. 

Sure it is when applying to what I'd rather do, just as it applies to if what *you* would only do.  You'd rather be renter and a servant, I'd rather be a landowner, and a customer.  Fine by me.

&gt;I didn't ask how a stronger currency will survive.

Sure you did, or at least you tried to argue how a country with a strong currency couldn't keep a strong economy - and you were shown in practice how it works.

These goal posts aren't for moving.  You said it.  You ballsed it.  I'll hold you to your mistakes.  

&gt;This was said in a sarcastic way and shouldn't be taken literally

Really?  Because that's how you started this thread.  You're now saying everything you've argued shouldn't be taken on face value?  Fair enough.  I accept your concession (although I suspect you need to go back to the start to appreciate the hole you've dug, you clearly can''t remember)

&gt;Irrelevant, 

Clearly relevant when I have to talk you through how to read posts, have to restate comments doubletime for you to understand.  You've time and time again argued something I've not said, tried to make out that I've said something I didn't, and failed to understand, read even links properly.

Your second language is very good, for a second language, but there's no point me having to keep pointing you back to something so you can catch up to speed.  In fact that I'm having to do that takes all the fun out of it.  I'd thought you were a poorly informed American, not that all Americans are, but now I know that your big problem is reading English articles, then I'm done.

No offense but I'm not an English teacher.  I've given you plenty already to go back and study, and realise your mistakes.

Hope you had a good Christmas too.

I have said already that i read the article. Why don't you read the posts ? Are you blind ?

p.s. You don't know what irony means. You made up your mind on why i dissed the telegraph without me saying why. Hence there is no irony.

&gt;Leave MENSA to those that stand a chance. You said it would take hundreds and thousands. I showed you hundreds OF thousands, on year, even millions.

Haha you little shitty troll. Surely it isn't fine since you use the premise as an argument. Sorry mate, already debunked that and explained it to you. You went to the negative side now(figuratively).

What a fine sign of weakness. Ofcourse when you lose in the debate you start addressing irrelevant things. It is ok though. You know you suck at rational thinking, i know it too. 

&gt;learly relevant when I have to talk you through how to read posts, have to restate comments doubletime for you to understand. You've time and time again argued something I've not said, tried to make out that I've said something I didn't, and failed to understand, read even links properly.

This is the definition of irony. If you want more help, look it up on the internet. 

&gt; I'd thought you were a poorly informed American, not that all Americans are, but now I know that your big problem is reading English articles, then I'm done.

Nope.  Doesn't cut it.  You said the effect I was describing could work but only in the thousands at least.  I gave you hundreds of thousands, if not millions.  You either argue not with me but the past-you.

&gt;Haha you little shitty troll. Surely it isn't fine since you use the premise as an argument. 

Rather I used your argument, agreed with you, but then said I freely wished to be on the other end.  You argue that a weak currency brings investment?  Fine.  I agree.  I'd rather be the investor.  You argue that a weaker currency brings tourism?  I agree.  I'd rather be the tourist with the disposable income because of a stronger currency.  It goes on...

&gt;What a fine sign of weakness. Ofcourse when you lose in the debate you start addressing irrelevant things.

You're the one that referred to your original argument and then referred to it all being irony.  Maybe this'd work better if I conversed in your native tongue?

&gt;Delicious irony, so sweet.

SO YOU ARE AMERICAN!  Great (You couldn't possibly be Canadian or anything south, well, you could but it would be improbable with your lack of European knowledge).  I thought as much.  Your understanding of Europe is poor.  Really poor.  Your surprise that there were more than a few thousand Brits living in France or that there was a million with homes in Spain was a give-away.  I thought I'd leave the breadcrumb trap anyway.

By the way you just lied about 'you on the continent' thing.  

Liar.

Join me again...you'd rather me with a stronger currency to invest in you than you would have a stronger currency to invest in me.  You'd rather be landtrapped by currency working with tourists than having tourists, with dispensable income because of the strength of the currency, visiting you.

true,rpad,null,null,"* If legalization of gay marriage is impossible politically for at least 50 years, why enshrine a ban in the constitution?

Note that the wording in the constitution is not of a ""ban"", it is of a conservative definition of the marriage. It doesn't say that ""gay marriage is banned"". It is interpreted as a ""ban"", but to Christian Democrats, the conservative wording is what they got. That is what they got out of the deal, and nothing really was taken away, except the hope of gay people, that there would be gay marriage in Hungary anytime soon.

At first every party was invited to discussions about the constitution, and the independents too. The socialists walked away right at the start of discussions, Gyurcsány posed the condition of having referendum to cooperate (tho its better for anyone to *not* have his cooperation anyway) the rest went away when the change to electoral law came to table. 

Practically only LMP is currently ""worthy enough"" to lend any credibility to ""multiparty cooperation on the constitution"" (certainly not the contagious political zombie Gyurcsány, or the far-right Jobbik). But LMP has their own logic, which (as they are young and for the young), does not touch they issue of ""finishing up the unfinished 1989 constitution"". They don't care that much about the previous regime, and the task of ""putting things back to order"". Their attitude is that of what the previous president of Hungary (Sólyom) has, that the previous constitution is fine, and it shouldn't be changed at all. So in the end there is no one to make deals with. To that extent, that politicians of the governing party take old documents of socialist proposals, and try to work with that, as an ""opposition proposal"". With 2/3 majority, the ruling parties don't really need the opposition's cooperation, and the opposition doesn't want to make deals from such a disadvantageous position.

If you look a 1989, that too, was a short window of opportunity. By 1994, the opposition that made the regime change was in ruins. Every party was penetrated by former communist agents, parties were falling apart, and the liberals were in pact with the socialists. Politics in Hungary is full of ""reactionary"" events.

If you haven't already, you might wanna watch [La Haine (Hate)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Haine), by Matthieu Kassovitz. It's a cult movie about french *banlieues* in the 90's. And maybe even [Ma 6-T va crack-er](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_6-T_va_crack-er), though it would mostly be for the soundtrack, which is sort of a snapshot of rap music in France in late 90's.

true,timdev,null,null,"&gt; Note that the wording in the constitution is not of a ""ban"", it is of a conservative definition of the marriage. It doesn't say that ""gay marriage is banned"". It is interpreted as a ""ban"", but to Christian Democrats, the conservative wording is what they got. That is what they got out of the deal, and nothing really was taken away, except the hope of gay people, that there would be gay marriage in Hungary anytime soon.

So, practically speaking, a constitutional ban.  It goes further than saying ""gay marriage is banned"" -- it says that ""gay marriage is a contradiction -- something which logically cannnot exist"".  Which of course it can (at least as far a state's recognition of marriage for legal reasons).  So it strikes me as a de-facto ban, and you'll have to excuse me if I think you're playing semantics.

Regardless -- and I'll be the first to disclaim my American perspective --  but the marriage definition (and to a lesser extent, the bit about life beginning at conception in the context of protecting fundamental rights) strike me as, well, inappropriate subjects to address in a Constitution.

From over here, the whole thing stinks of an ascendent party attempting to cement its influence by leveraging an unusual, and likely temporary, political context.

My hungarian isn't good enough that I can follow things in hungarian, so I'm left reliant on english-language sources.  But I find it hard to believe that opposition parties would completely boycott the drafting of a new constitution unless the were convinced that they'd gain no substantial concessions, and in fact only legitimize the process.

What harm would the nation have suffered if Fidesz had waited a few years, until other parties had regained some footing, and and meaningful debate and compromise were possible?

I guess what I'd like to know is this:  I see a number of Hungarians saying ""The Socialists are making this all out to be so bad"", and then describing the changes, with some detail, as minor.  For instance, claiming that the central bank is still independent, they just added a 3rd vice-president to be chosen by the government -- and he follows what the boss says, and is therefore basically powerless.  What I want to know, is if these changes are so benign, what motivates them?  After all, they must have some intended effect.  I'd genuinely appreciate any insight you could lend me (even if it's it's links to other (english-language) sources.

Hamburg is culturally rich, not as expensive as Munich and at just over 3 million people is not too big, but not too small. I've been once for a weekend and would have no problem living there. 

For jobs I would check out:

And lastly possibly the best resource for moving to Germany is the toytown site. It's for English speaking foreigners and is very active. You'd probably have the best chance of finding work on there and getting many other questions answered regarding the cost of living and other such things.

First of all, he's not a monster, he's not some great white threat to the world, he's a man, a small, narcissistic, dangerous man. But no one seems to treat him like it, they make him something bigger, which I think is what he wants, his name means something now. I think the population wants for him so badly to be seriously mentally ill so they can excuse him and pity him because no one wants to believe in evil in a sane man. 

Schizophrenia is a very complicated diagnoses, hard to disprove once someone has been diagnosed with it. Here's what I think about the process; if you are not 100% that the worst killer in norways history after ww2 has this diagnoses, you analyse him again. And again. And once every five years for the rest of his life and give him the help he needs. You don't do it out of spite or fear or pressure, you do it because as a psychologist you help sick people. 

As for media and many, many people; fucking stop it, you are not in anyway shape or form educated to start guessing about his mental health. And for the know it alls, s""h yes, schitzophrenia is a dangerous desiese, yes they should lock them all up"", you know what my first thought was when I heard his diagnosis? Poor bastards who are schizophrenic and a working part of our society now. The one thing that media should have done which they haven't is go out to the people nd fucking explain what the diagnosis is and how it works. 

I'm sick of the sensation around him, rubbing him in our faces all the time, he did something terrible, he needs help, I wish they focused more on giving him that and letting us go on with our lifes instead of telling us that ""he spent his christmas watching telly"".

You can also get around Germany pretty cheap by using a car sharing site called http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de/. Worth knowing for when you are here....

true,rpad,null,null,"There are two distinct questions on ""putting people into positions"": 
1. Do the people on those position do their job politically neutrally?
2. Do those newly appointed people on those positions change the ratio of of people assigned to those positions (controlling board) by one or the other political side?

If you look at these questions, you will see, that if 1. is true, then 2. should be pretty much irrelevant. If 1. is not true, then people on ""neutral"" positions are not really neutral, and the neutral working of state institutions depends on the ratio of people assigned to that position by a specific political side. Simply said, in that case the competition and mutual distrust is controlling the balance. There are the laws too, so all this is assumed to be withing legal borders.

There are examples to both, in both Hungarian and pretty much in any country's state institutions. What the Fidesz government did, was that they reduced the overall bureaucracy (they are good at that, since state workers are not quite their voter base, so they have no qualms in firing anyone), but they also changed around the traditional way some of the institutions were governed. For example the state media is still governed by a politically mixed board. But the media authority, which is the result of merging two previous institutions, is supposed to be a politically independent, public institution, while one of the previous two institutions from which the new single one was created was a directly government controlled bureau, and the other had a mixed board. It was not an imperative, that all state institutions should have boards which correspond to same principles as previously. 

This raises some problems. For example the Klubradio issue. Since the previous media authority was politically staffed, political deals were determining which political side gets what. There should be one Fidesz and one MSZP loyal station (the SZDSZ loyal station was cseated out of the deal, since they lost political support anyway), and the deal was on. That is how it went in 2009. Now, the new media authority should behave apolitically, so they are under pressure from all sides. If they decide politically, then they are not anymore an independent institution, and if they do, then Klubradio might lose its frequency (as it did), which looks just as bad, even worse. After such a decision it will be hard to prove that the new media authority is politically neutral. If they take away the Fidesz loyal radio station, the left-liberals will say that it was done as a show, and Fidesz already got another radio. If they leave it, then they will be accused that they are willing to take away frequency from one side, but they would not take away frequency of the side, which appointed them. 

The president of the central bank should be politically neutral. That is how it should be, since the CB should be independent, and it can only remain independent if it does not mess into politics itself. The current president was assigned to his position by the previous government, and the president is personally a good friend to the previous PM. There is distrust between the CB and the current government. My guess is that the ""third VP"" would have the role of listening to what is actually happening at the CB, being a kind of ""silent control"" for the case the CB attempts something strange. Note that currently there is no ""third VP"" assigned to the CB, that is an open possibility. The problem is, by definition, the CB should be independent, and if the president can't chose his VP himself that already qualifies as limiting his power. On the other side, the CB actually got some new powers. So technically (in controlling the money systems) it got stronger, but on political side it got a bit less independent, even if only as a possibility for now. Anyway, it won't go well with the EU.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; my opinion is that money reaches it maximum potential usage when it retains value over the long term - which, to me, is zero inflation

How would this be better than steady, predictable low inflation? This low level of inflation serves the purpose of keeping capital active. You can think of it as a tax on idle money, to keep people from putting it under their mattresses and to instead invest it into companies that need capital to grow and create jobs.

The part about inflation being steady and predictable is to reduce risk. If it's unpredictable, then a creditor or partner in a long-term contract has to add a risk premium to the interest rates or the agreed on prices, which would reduce productivity along each edge of the economic network.  
Government bods are a good example for this, because they often have maturity dates ten or even as long as thirty years in the future. If a country's inflation (or rather, the currency the debt is denominated in) is unpredictable, then the buyer of the bond will demand interest rates that would reduce the effects of potentially high inflation. If it's at a predictable two percent, though, the investor just adds two percent to the profit s/he expects for such an investment.  

That's why demonstrating a willingness to ""inflate ones way out"" drives up interest rates. Investors have to assume you'll do the same thing in the future, possibly within the duration of their investment, and ask for a risk premium to cover such a potential step.

However, this has to be weighted against risk premiums on potential defaults. A country's economy needs to grow at least fast enough for increased income to cover the interest on existing debt. This is very hard to do at times of high unemployment.

The situation we have now is that wages in several European countries are too high for them to be internationally competitive. They have to come down, in relative terms, one way or the other. There basically are two ways to accomplish this -- either by keeping them nominally steady, and reducing them equally across the board through inflation, or to bring down wages of new hires by having an oversupply in the work force (read: high unemployment), which would increase the real wages of those who still have their old job contracts and provide an incentive for investors to delay investments, because this would be a deflationary scenario.

IMHO, aiming for four or five percent inflation for a couple of years wouldn't be such a bad idea, compared to the alternatives. Not just socially, but probably economically as well. There still would be negative effects, but sometimes there is no ideal solution.",0,1325761942,null,0,false,0,c3e4zfm,t3_o2fkw,t1_c3e4zfm,t1_c3dxmxw,null,1428127167,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,OneSalientOversight,AUST,Australia,"I'm finding it difficult to understand the logic you're using here. You're saying that because inflation isn't predictable - but rather unpredictable - then it is good to reduce risk.

I agree with you here 100% What I'm finding difficult to understand is that you think that ""Zeroflation"" is ""unpredictable"".

In the end what I'm talking about here is ""Price Stability"". The reason why I believe in ""Zeroflation"" is because of the following.

* Inflation is the reduction of money's purchasing power. The higher inflation gets, the less purchasing power a person or business has. Money is supposed to be a store of value so if money keeps losing its value it also begins to lose its usefulness. If inflation then moves into hyperinflation, you then have a system in which money ceases to have value and is no longer used for economic activity. A barter system then emerges.

* Deflation, however, is an increase in money's purchasing power. The more deflation there is, the more value a person's cash and bank deposits are. But this is also not a good thing because if money keeps getting more and more valuable, people will cease to use it to invest in capital and instead keep it under their beds. The use of money as a method of exchange then drops considerably. As deflation gets worse, so too will a barter system emerge.

So the problem is this: when prices are unstable and when a person's money changes in value considerably (either as a loss of value with inflation or as an increase in value with deflation), then the inevitable result is a breakdown of the monetary system and a return to the more inefficient barter system of pre-civilised times.

So armed with these two different but similar facts (or axioms if you like), there is obviously a median between the two, whereby money is used in its most efficient way. Inflation leads to an imbalance, as does deflation.

So what is the best median between the two? I would argue that it is *Absolute Price Stability*, where money neither goes up or goes down in value. Such a situation makes for a stable economic environment (all things being equal of course).

In practice there is no doubting that a policy of absolute price stability would not succeed in having prices remain stable every single day, month, quarter or year. That is actually not a problem. The issue is whether prices remain stable over the long term. There can certainly be short term price hikes or price drops, but over a period of a few years, monetary policy should focus upon keeping the index stable (If the index is at 100 in year one, and is 100 in year three, that's good policy).

I won't address the issue of high European Wages as I honestly think that's a Furphy argued by Eurosceptics that has been influential for too many years.

A tax on European financial transactions, a Tobin Tax, is the best solution in this situation.

And why not use inflation to reduce debt? Probably because that is what many countries have done in the past to their own detriment. Many countries in South America, for example, had very high inflation levels throughout the 80s and 90s as they sought to inflate away their debt. They're only now recovering - and mainly because they have sought to keep prices stable instead.

Germany after WW2 is another example. In the years following WW2 the West German government was hampered by US economic controls and experienced very high levels of inflation. Living standards dropped considerably from the time the US took control of the West German economy. When the US gave up and let the West Germans control the economy themselves, the first thing they did was enact policies to reduce inflation. Once the money (the Deutschmark) reliably retained a store of value, the economy began growing again. Within 20 years they were the richest country in Europe.

And what about the US during the 70s? It wasn't Reagan, but Paul Volcker who saved the US economy. How? By killing off inflation.

(BTW, don't somehow think that Zeroflation is equivalent to zero money growth. It isn't. The money supply can still be growing during a period of deflation. It is also possible for the money supply to be shrinking during a period of inflation. The money supply is an important factor in inflation, but not the only one)",0,1325765493,null,0,false,0,c3e56cg,t3_o2fkw,t1_c3e56cg,t1_c3e4zfm,null,1428127263,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

But of course that's going to depend on what you can earn of course. Munich and south-west Germany are two of the most expensive parts of Germany. Frankfurt will be cheaper than Munich. If you go to Berlin it's going to be even cheaper, or some mid-sized city like Cologne.

Depends what job you're looking for. If you want a real finance job, yeah you'll want Frankfurt and prob have a better chance doing as jh1980 suggested by looking for a global company here in Aus (how about Deutsche Bank?). If you're looking for just any job for your working holiday, you'll have a lot more fun in a smaller city or even a university town (btw you can only work 90 days at a time at a single place, so this visa isn't a career starter option). University towns in Germany are pretty awesome. Small cities in Germany aren't as boring as the towns we have in Australia (sorry if I often anyone, but it's true, we're just too spread out!!).

I lived in Konstanz in south west Germany. I was told it's an expensive part of Germany, it was still cheaper than Australia. It was a great little town. Right on the Bodensee/Lake Constance and on the border with Switzerland. Don't rule out smaller cities in Germany because you might do that in Australia. The population structure is completely different and being in a smaller city doesn't mean lack of access to decent services like it does in Australia.

I can definitely recommend Munich. The rents there are very high, but so are the wages. You should definitely consider getting a job as a trainee or working student at a financial company of you have a financial degree. I can not emphasize this enough. I lived in Berlin as well as in Munich, and in Munich you can make almost twice the money with the same set of skills. The low unemployment and the strong economy in Munich are working on your side here, and young people with higher education are in high demand. I recieve 500€ for every university student i drag into the company, but *i can't find any*. It's 5000€ for a full-time employee. I'm studying politics and communication, so i don't have any financial skills. I still make 16€ an hour (about 20 AUD), with what is basically a decent knowledge of Microsoft Office. The cantina of the financial company i worked at was full of young people from all over the world, many of them barely spoke German. English was a requirement for all German employees.

Here are two lists of Germanys best-rated employers:
[GPTW Top 100](http://www.greatplacetowork.de/best/lists.php?year=current&amp;idListName=de&amp;detail=0)
[CRF Top 100](http://de.toparbeitgeber.com/TopArbeitgeberDeutschland/TopArbeitgeberDeutschland2011.aspx)

Check them out and look for branches in Munich and Frankfurt, and if they also operate in Australia. That would be a good place to start. I'm pretty sure you can get a well-paid gig in Munich for a few months with a financial degree - if you are willing to knock on a few doors. If you're sharing a flat with other students, the costs of living are managable, but probably still a bit higher than in Frankfurt.

And then there's the time when you are not working. I think Munich is a great experience for foreigners, because it's very, very traditional and beautiful but *also* has a lot of subculture and good clubs once you manage to look past all the rich people and Lederhosen. I'ver never lived in Frankfurt, but i don't think it has that mixture, and it's not exactly the most inviting place.

(Munich should pay me.)

My favourite city is Berlin though, the world capitol of skipping showers and getting utterly wasted all the time.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; I'm finding it difficult to understand the logic you're using here. You're saying that because inflation isn't predictable - but rather unpredictable - then it is good to reduce risk.

Apparently I haven't been clear enough, because that's not at all what I was trying to express.

What I'm saying is that positive, *steady, predictable* inflation is the ideal. The steady and predictable part, like the ECB's long-standing 2% goal, has the purpose of minimizing risk premiums on interest rates, without sacrificing the positive effects of moderate inflation (i.e., to keep money in circulation instead of under mattresses). If you can be reasonably sure that inflation will remain at a known level over the duration of your loan, you don't need to compensate for the risk of your money losing more value than through this predictable loss through higher interest rates. The interest rates would therefore be [value loss through inflation] + [desired profit], whereas the entirely separate scenario in which inflation was unpredictable would add a [risk premium] to the calculation to compensate for potential higher inflation. Put differently, if you *know* inflation will be two percent, you add two percent to your desired profit. If you don't know what it will be, you have to add enough to cover what inflation *might* be in a bad case, or instead prefer short term investments where you have the option to reassess your strategy in reaction to inflation going up, instead of tying your investment to a fixed interest rate over a long time.

So, different scenarios: Predictable inflation, and unpredictable inflation.

What may make this a bit confusing is that I'm actually arguing in favor of diverting from the steady path, to temporarily permit a higher inflation to combat the current exceptional situation. Yes, this would set a precedent, and therefore there will be a small premium on future interest rates. I find this the ""less bad"" solution, because it would be socially more acceptable than the alternatives, and I reckon it would be cheaper overall to pay a risk premium on potential future increased-inflation policies than to pay a risk premium on potential defaults. I'm saying ""overall"", because countries like e.g., Germany or the Netherlands would have to pay the inflationary risk premium, whereas they wouldn't have to pay a default risk premium of any significance. I'm fairly certain, however, that increased demand from a more healthy periphery would more than make up for it.

To actually comment on your reply, I'm glad we agree on deflation. The problem we have here is that the Eurozone isn't homogeneous. Keeping overall inflation at two percent, or even at zero percent, would mean wage deflation in the periphery, through prolonged high unemployment rates. That's the last thing they need right now, for the effects you mentioned -- why hire somebody right away, if you can higher him for less once he's desperate enough to work for less?

&gt; So the problem is this: when prices are unstable and when a person's money changes in value considerably (either as a loss of value with inflation or as an increase in value with deflation), then the inevitable result is a breakdown of the monetary system and a return to the more inefficient barter system of pre-civilised times.

Try to think of price stability as ""price predictability"". This still allows for storage of value, although the means to do so is through investment that at least covers inflation. In your zero inflation scenario, the proverbial mattress that I've mentioned a couple of times now would be a valid form of long term storage of wealth. In a low inflation scenario, this would mean loss of value, so you'd have to store your wealth in a way that prevents that. The traditional way to do this are government bonds, which are (or have been) considered very safe, and payed just about enough to cover inflation loss.  
Most sane people don't store their wealth in cash. Wage increases balance out price increases, and savings go into interest bearing accounts. For long term storage of large amounts, there are profit making investments into companies or inflation-proof storage through assets like real estate. 

Zero percent is also dangerously close to deflation. It doesn't quite have the same negative effects, but it doesn't have the opposite, positive effects, either. What's the difference between very low deflation, zero inflation, and very low inflation, really, if those differences are below increases of productivity and profits a conservative investment into a safe but interest paying instrument would yield?

&gt; In practice there is no doubting that a policy of absolute price stability would not succeed in having prices remain stable every single day, month, quarter or year. That is actually not a problem. The issue is whether prices remain stable over the long term. There can certainly be short term price hikes or price drops, but over a period of a few years, monetary policy should focus upon keeping the index stable (If the index is at 100 in year one, and is 100 in year three, that's good policy).

Again, what you really want is predictability, not necessarily absolute stability. My point is precisely this -- predictability is in principle desired, because it takes out the risk of long term arrangements. Zero inflation would have no additional benefits, but would suffer from the same issues as deflation (keep in mind that for some investments, like in anything technology related, go down predictably independently of wages and general inflation), although to a lesser degree. It's as much zero deflation as it is zero inflation, if you will.

&gt; And why not use inflation to reduce debt? Probably because that is what many countries have done in the past to their own detriment.

Yes, but they had made a habit out of it. That's why it would have to be perfectly clear that this would be an exceptional measure, with safeguards to prevent a similar situation in the future. What this is really about is investors' expectations. As I said before, the reason I would find this acceptable in the current situation is that I believe the inflation risk premium on interest rates would be less than the default risk premium.

&gt; Germany after WW2 is another example. In the years following WW2 the West German government was hampered by US economic controls and experienced very high levels of inflation. Living standards dropped considerably from the time the US took control of the West German economy. When the US gave up and let the West Germans control the economy themselves, the first thing they did was enact policies to reduce inflation. Once the money (the Deutschmark) reliably retained a store of value, the economy began growing again. Within 20 years they were the richest country in Europe.

I've looked into this, and incidentally, consumer prices over the first decade were remarkably stable, actually pretty much exactly zero percent, over all. Have a look at [this table](http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Content/Publikationen/Fachveroeffentlichungen/Preise/Verbraucherpreise/VerbraucherpreisindexLangeReihenPDF__5611103,property=file.pdf), the two columns going back to 1948 are living expenses of a median income four person household on the left, and general consumer prices on the right.  
There also was the very stable exchange rate, up until about 1970, against the [US dollar](http://www.bundesbank.de/statistik/statistik_zeitreihen.en.php?func=row&amp;open=devisen&amp;tr=WJ5009).

Also, I really don't believe many valid conclusions can be drawn from German economic growth in the immediate years after WWII, when practically the whole country had to be rebuilt and Germany's had to be reintegrated into the world economy.

&gt; A tax on European financial transactions, a Tobin Tax, is the best solution in this situation.

This is an entirely different discussion, and I actually would like to see a (very low) transaction tax. There are political problems with this, mainly in regards to the UK's giant financial sector, but in any case this is entirely independent of the target inflation.

&gt; (BTW, don't somehow think that Zeroflation is equivalent to zero money growth. It isn't. The money supply can still be growing during a period of deflation. It is also possible for the money supply to be shrinking during a period of inflation. The money supply is an important factor in inflation, but not the only one)

The existence of the limits is not. Whether they limits were actually reached and whether it contributes anything to the current debt crisis is.

It is possible to have unlimited GDP growth without having ANY growth in resource usage if the growth itself fully ephemeral like software.

&gt;Capitalism means free market economy. And with this comes a scary truth that money and greed overlaps entrepreneurship and creativity. 

It often does, typically when it is not ""faced"" i.e. not managed by one man but held by many different shareholders. But actually we tend to have more governmental problems than market ones. We are trying to run economies where like 25-30% of the people actually works in a value-creating way i.e. employed by the market, not the state, and the rest gets handouts often disguised as state jobs, fake disability etc. etc.

&gt;Socialist states play by capitalist principles, or don't you see it in the blatant consumerism

Not at all. What the fuck is blatant consumerism anyway. People want to live in comfort. So what? Before the 1960s or so pretty much everybody was poor. We should be glad it is not the case anymore.

What does that even mean that they play by capitalist principles. People want stuff because they want to live comfortably. How could any state deny this without becoming a tyranny. 

&gt;Social spending, government-provided services, housing etc, welfare, old age pensions, rigid job market, etc... these merely try to maintain some social cohesion and stability instead of letting rampant liberal predatory attitudes balancing them out which would mean great injustice and social violence.

This is just rhetorics. Try to understand the basic logic of economics, of the incentive principle. The more the state raises the cost of doing business and employing people, the less jobs we have. The less jobs we have, the more the state has to spend on jobless people while getting less taxes. This is a very negative cycle, and can only be broken by making people more employable (less tax, lower wage, less protections), which means more employment, which means more taxes, which starts a positive feedback cycle.

I have no idea what this rampant predatory stuff means, but our real problem is making it hard to do business and employ people and then we act all butthurt when the jobs move to places that don't make it had like China. It is a heavy dose of not acknowledging reality and the fact that businesses react to incentives that is the real problem. We legislate like 5 weeks of holidays fully paid plus state holidays and we expect that the business won't say ""Fine, I move somewhere else I don't have to pay people for a month and half for doing nothing"" and we totally act surprised as if it was not a totally expectable and the most natural thing of the world.

Rampant predatory? All I see is capital and jobs fleeing to Asia because we made it disadvantegous for them to stay and Asia offered a better deal. Nobody is doing anything to us. Our problem is that they are NOT doing something - offering jobs, especially to young people - we are used to, because we in our foolishness thought we can spend other people's money forever and they will just accept it. Well, it seems they won't.

&gt; Besides, all these mean nothing in comparison to the harsh reality that our planet is a closed system and our species is essentially committing suicide by destroying the ecosystem.

I consider this plain simple scaremongering. Unless one buys into the ridiculous AGW fraud, the only serious environmental issues are the rising price of fossil fuels (but synthfuel research is well on the way and we can set up coal-oil conversion plants etc., or breeder reactors that reuse radioactive fuel) and some rare-earth metals (which sooner or later we will need to mine back from the garbage heaps).

You need to be open minded and the nature of Frankfurt people is typical for the state of Hesse: they have an odd, dark sense of humor and people love playing out the contrast of being Europe's financial HQ while behaving a bit trashy. Their football club Eintracht Frankfurt and the infamous Titanic Magazine are reflective of this: both are considered somewhat the assholes of their genre and they're all like ""nobody likes us, TROLLOLOL"". Great fun!    
Many germans are prejudiced against Frankfurt, saying that it's crime ridden and full of angry southerners. But this isn't fair towards the people since most of them are really nice and polite. Also stating that it is full of southerners is just wrong. It's the home of 180 nationalities. This is amazing! It's a bit like the city in Blade Runner ;) It is truly the heart of Europe. Crime may be an issue in certain areas, but again: as long as you don't suffer from a testosterone overdose, this shouldn't be a problem at all. But don't think Frankfurt is a cheap place to live. Especially with a low wage job. Friends of mine say rental prices are on the rise, even though the city is heavily expanding and expected to gain +50,000 citizens within fewer than 10 years from now. But it's totally worth the experience living there a few months.  
Munich is more what you expect it to be: a charming romantic townscape, people are polite (yet a bit conservative and reserved), a good highbrow culture, the entertainment possibilities including night-life is more in-crowd and mainstream compatible than Frankfurt. I was born near Munich and I love this place. But it's also over the top expensive. If you are into a wonderful postcard-picture experience, Munich is your place to be. You have the Alps right infront of your door. Leave Munich's borders and you are right in the middle of famous Upper Bavaria, the heart of bavarian culture. Also Austria is just around the corner.

Stop avoiding.

         tourist, or would you rather be 'they', (2) those that have

Choose. I'm quite happy to say I'm of the latter. Et tu: 1 or 2?

Oh, now I know it stung when I said it.  Was it when I twirled you on whether you were US or Continental?

You can't possibly be continental given your misunderstandings of Europe, you didn't even know about the UK middleclass migration (so far you've called it rich, and less than thousands - so you're certainly not Spanish)

**Straight forward enough, but you missed it again :D**


One of your first points:  


     Would you rather be 'that', (1)providing the service to the
     tourist, or would you rather be 'they', (2) those that have 
     the disposable income with the stronger currency
     enabling them to visit?

&gt;Oh, now I know it stung when I said it. Was it when I twirled you on whether you were US or Continental? 

Hahaha, again you address my origin but you have no idea. I laugh behind my monitor at your conclusion for it is on par with the rest of your agruments.

I am not sure if you even are English. Your understanding of the language is really, really limited. You do not understand an argument in your own language how would you even write in another. If you were being sarcastic then i give it to you. You almost made me laugh, little jester.

And year after year, I learn of more and more shitty acts that country has perpetrated. And continues to do so! And what's sick is that the majority seem to support it!

I obviously can't speak for everyone in it, but I'm saying this now: America is an evil country.

News shouldn't be balanced. The fact that Fox News uses this slogan is an indication that they care nothing about or know nothing about journalism (I'm betting both). 

Truth is not relative and there are not necessarily two sides to everything. 

The journalist's job is to take a look at the story and using the facts come to a conclusion and report it. It's not helpful to have 24 hours of competing talking heads arguing over something without someone there to separate fact from fiction. This is supposed to be the journalist's job. 

Watch Fox News. Again and again you will see liberal head 1 saying A, B and C. Conservative heads 1 through 4 will argue. But, the journalist or anchor does not interrupt and tell the public who is right according to the facts. 

Liberal: This study shows gays raising children is just fine.

Conservative: Nu-uh! That's a lie! It's not true! What liberal think tank came up with that?

* 800+ homes for the elderly.
* 350+ kindergarten and orphanages
* 3,000+ other social centers (ex-convicts, drug addicts, prostitutes, AIDS - terminally ill, cerebral palsy...)

Spain pays way more than the 13 euro millions per year to the Church that the article mentions (over 5,000 milions in fact). This is due to the diverse agreements that allow regular citizens to use Catholic hospitals and schools and elderly homes, among others.

Why does the Spanish government do that? Because the cost per patient / per student is much cheaper than the average in the public school system (where they have to account for building the schools among other costs).

IIRC there was a study back in 2004 that determined that Spain would need to spend 31,000 euro millions to provide the same services that the publicly available network of the Catholic Church currently offers.

All of these institutions, buildings, etc. are the property of the Catholic Church. These 13 euro million plus the tax exemption (hundreds of millions) are sort of a fee included in the agreement between Spain and the Catholic Church.

Just as an example of what I'm talking about, [this article](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,443130,00.html) in Time Magazine (april 2003) about [Isidoro Macias](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidoro_Mac%C3%ADas) known as ""padre patera"".

Munich is a very pretty but extortionately expensive city. It has some very good universities for the scientific areas: TUM and LMU. Unfortunately outside some specific parts like the research centres, Munich is extremely parochial which makes it much harder to mix (even amongst the local expat community).

In Frankfurt, it is an extremely small city, just 600K people or so and most you will meet in the workplace are not local which makes it much easier to mix. Frankfurt companies are quite used to dealing with foreigners and there are many companies that do not require German but do require English.

Another point is that whilst Munich is more standalone, Frankfurt forms part of the Rhein-Main region with neighboring cities such as Wiesbaden-Mainz and Darmstadt. More people work in Frankfurt than in Munich but travel in from the many towns outside.

If you were a scientist or wanted to be high-tech startups (typically biotech), Munich is better. There are some funds based in Munich but banking wise it is kind-of dead. For that you need Frankfurt which has the brokers, the trading rooms and so on. It still has the HQs of Germany's two largest banks as well as the main markets and the main German offices of many foreign banks.

If you were looking at jobs in finance for industry, the problem  becomes more complicated. Banks will do a lot of work through their branch network but the big stuff will still go via Frankfurt.

The new elected government instead of being worried by the actual problems of the population, namely unemployment, was actually worried about people watching American TV shows online for free. So, the PP passed a law that allows media companies to shut down webs without judicial supervision, and basically allows indiscriminate censorship. 

Why there wasn't public debate? Because in Spain the two major parties govern enlightened absolutism style: ""all for the people, without the people"", and interpret absolute majorities as a ""carte blanche"" to do whatever they want.

The approach to due impartiality may vary according to the nature of the subject, the type of programme and channel, the likely expectation of the audience as to content, and the extent to which the content and approach is signalled to the audience.

I'm not sure if your branch of the family is in the sheep-fucking business, but back in the Basque Country highlands, they do tend a lot of sheep. Those who emigrated from there to the United States maintained their identity and sheepdoing ways, mostly in the Southwest and Boise, Idaho.

But in your case, it was mostly the coastal, seafaring Basques who provided the leadership to the Spanish fleets during their age of discover, like Juan Sebastián Elcano, from Getaria, Spain. But that was in the 1500's, so I doubt that a rogue sailor would've been able to pass a family name along this many years, especially when pre-Spanish Filipino tradition had it that a person would take the family name from their children. It was the Jesuits, also a Basque institution, who converted many of the Filipino population to Christianity during Spanish rule, and no doubt they used their [limited or prejudiced] knowledge of patrimonial names to provide for the new system. I wouldn't be surprised if a cleric baptized all of the local children with his last name.

I'd have to disagree strongly with that statement.

I work in a US company in Germany and get to observe the English skills of both our staff and our customers on a daily basis. Both are usually pretty poor, up to the point where they refuse to speak English at all.

Also, I studied English at a Bavarian university, so I got to experience the English capabilities of my fellow students (soon-to-be English teachers, both Hauptschule and Gymnasium) first hand. Believe me, they're nowhere near excellent (then and now).
