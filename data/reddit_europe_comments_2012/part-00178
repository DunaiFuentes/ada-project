true,beachdrinking,null,null,"&gt; I didn't say corporations are people, I stated they operate within society. A society that expects a net benefit, otherwise, why have them? We expect corporations to provide employment both directly and indirectly, we expect goods and/or services and we expect tax.

If society expects benefits from corporations, it should implement rules that yield those benefits.

Corporations are just as mindless as wind and the ocean, which can also be damaging or benefiting. The difference is that winds and oceans operate under the laws of nature, which society can't alter. But it *can* change the laws corporations have to respect.

The point is that those laws are forcing corporations to avoid taxes where they can. If they don't, their (tax-avoiding) competition will destroy them. It's just natural selection.

&gt; any corp with its head screwed on the right way will understand the damage that such negative attention can bring.

**Use** would be having a proper ADHD diagnosis from a psychiatrist and just generally being able to function better on stimulant medication.  Believe it or not, ADHD exists.  Consider dyslexia, for example.  People with dyslexia are not stupid or lazy when it comes to reading; they have very specific difficulties that can be eased with some intervention.  Similarly, people with ADHD have a very specific set of difficulties that can be helped with the right sort of intervention.

**Abuse** would be somebody taking Adderall that hasn't been prescribed to them, or (in my book) somebody getting an Adderall prescription through illegitimate or questionable means (eg. getting a prescription from somebody who doesn't really understand ADHD).

----
(*Personal aside*)  I'm an American.  I did my computer science masters and PhD in France without any medication.  I didn't get diagnosed for ADHD until I was 32.  

And boy do I wish I'd had something like Adderall (I use Ritalin actually) the whole time. All those wasted years of just not being able to do anything. Yeah, so it *is* possible to get by just toughening up.  But at what cost?  I spent all my time in the office/lab just doing *nothing* and then trying to make up for lost time.  I spent all my weekends in front of the computer just doing *nothing*, and basically spent my first postdoc thinking I was just an idiot with a fancy degree.  Thinking maybe I was just lazy, or that maybe I just didn't have enough initiative or something.

And maybe I am just a lazy idiot with a fancy degree, but you know what?  Ever since I found out I had ADHD, and started taking Ritalin, my life has changed.  I'm living healthily, much more like a European, with a work/life balance rather than a no-work/work one.  I actually do my work, and not only that, the kinds of things I need to do to be able to function better, like get exercise, cook more, even start to experiment with having a social life.

So yeah, I very much resent the American students who abuse Adderall, because of how they rob those of us with proper ADHD of legitimacy, and how they allow the sort of misunderstandings and misconceptions about it to stick around.",0,1355474369,null,0,1355474843,0,c7gf0a8,t3_14sq1h,t1_c7gf0a8,t3_14sq1h,null,1430670832,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I never said it didn't feel right. t wasn't trying to point out a correlation between the French and money. I also wasn't saying that the international students I saw were Americans (there were, indeed, a lot of Asians). I meant that it seems the ieda of studying at le Cordon Bleu is popular to Americans, at least, thanks to promotion Julia Child's cookbooks, autobiography, and movie. 

The French I've talked to about the subject have told me that it's more common to apprentice under a chef than go to a cooking school. What do you think about this? Also, how are your classmates... not your cup of tea?

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't think you quite understand. You have no problem with the actual task at hand, you have an inability to focus on it long enough to actually do anything that's not high-stimulation on a regular basis. As with basically anything in the psychological realm, it's a spectrum, ranging from normal human to the most extreme extent of the disorder. A key element of diagnosis is supposed to be significant impairment in more than one setting (ex: School, work, socialization, home).

I grew up with a severe case of it somewhat masked by me being smart. I don't think I ever got a report card that didn't say something to the effect of ""not living up to potential"", or ""missing assignments"", etc. I knew HOW to do the work, what I couldn't do was focus long enough to spend time doing it.

The same sort of thing continued as I got older. Eventually, I got my own place and went to college, and then it became really apparent. Daily life/chores were one of the most difficult things. I lost 10lbs (I was already skinny), because I needed to focus for 30min to cook a decent meal and that didn't always happen. Frequently had to re-run loads of laundry because I'd get halfway through unloading the washer and then get distracted and go do something else. And on the days when I did manage to do all the normal chores, that would be it, whatever focus I had was pretty much shot, better hope there was nothing else that needed doing.

In college lecture, I'd never make it past 10min into class of paying attention. Maybe 15min if I was trying to take notes, that kept me slightly more occupied. Reading a book? I'd bounce all over the book, I couldn't read in order at all, if I read at all. Studying simply didn't happen.

Had tons of projects I'd start.....never finished a SINGLE thing I tried to do.

Driving was a fun one. Easy driving, like a open highway, and regardless of how much sleep I had, I'd have to stop every 45min because otherwise I would start falling asleep or just completely losing focus on the road. But something stimulating, like a blinding blizzard on a steep, slick mountain road? Drove for 8 hours straight in those conditions, it was full of stimulation.

I didn't go on medication, or even have much clue what was wrong with me until about 21 years old when I finally went to see someone. I'd tried everything I could think of to help before that, every time management/organizational technique I could find, etc, nothing worked for me, and I was pretty close to giving up on life.

Went on medication. Immediately, it was ""oh, this is how it's supposed to be"". Life before just kind of felt like I was along for the ride. I was going to do whatever interested me at that moment, regardless of what was in my best interests/what I was trying to actually get done. I can totally procrastinate on an assignment if I don't feel like doing it. But if I want to work on it, I don't have to spend the entire night on it, because every 5 minutes I lose focus and do something else in spite of wanting to get it done.

I have no idea what your idea of success involves, but mine involves being able to hold down a job, do the normal things everyone needs to do in life, and accomplish what I'd like to in life.",0,1355479820,null,0,false,0,c7gfm8v,t3_14sq1h,t1_c7gfm8v,t1_c7gex64,null,1430671119,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Wasn't my post, but understood. Apologies for a bit of the tone at the end.

&gt; I'll give my opinion on a related issue though, and I'd be interested in your thoughts... One of my major concerns is that it is easier to medicate people who fall outside of the realms of what is considered ""normality"" rather than create a society which can integrate them properly.

This is certainly true, and is a valid concern. It isn't as though ADHD is entirely bad. There is a good amount of theory and some evidence indicating that ADHD people are suited to fast-paced things, multitasking, and crisis situations, and also that we tend to gravitate toward jobs involving them. Firefighting/Emergency response being one example. 

In college I did IT Helpdesk, and that was a great fit (outside of long phone calls). The busier we got, the more overwhelmed/frazzled most people seemed to get, while I'd work better. Working on fixing 8 laptops at once, dealing with a phone call and another guy at the counter.....now I feel in my element.

-------------------------------------------------

I think it also plays into the question of who should be medicated, and also how much. What if people want to feel completely ""normal"" or maybe take up an occupation which requires a huge amount of focus, like accounting or something? Is that acceptable? Or is it only acceptable to take enough to function decently within society?

If it's only acceptable to take the minimum needed for function (and presumably to not medicate the borderline cases), why is psychiatric medication different in that the patient doesn't get to decide (to a degree) what level of treatment they want for the condition? It seems that the reason is largely because psych medication is a combination of something hard to comprehend, and inherently scary, it deals with brains, thinking, etc.

I like using allergies for a similar sort of condition, to get to something more concrete (to most people) for thinking about. I'm basically allergic to life. So spring through fall I generally have allergy symptoms. Sometimes they're awful and I need to take something or I'm going to spend the whole day with a box of tissues in bed. Sometimes they're minor or nothing at all. And everyone chooses a different level of treatment, and they may even vary it based on how they feel that day or what they're going to be doing. I might take a stronger one if I'm going to a farm that day, or I just want to feel perfect. Another day I might decide to tough it out.  

Additionally, pretty much anyone who has at least slightly bad allergies, can have the medication and use it as they need, it doesn't have to be life-destroyingly awful. This is considered perfectly acceptable and normal. The same goes for treating something like arthritis, or pretty much any other chronic condition where medication is mainly to alleviate symptoms.

-----------------------------------------------------

I don't have a good argument why someone meeting the basic diagnosis shouldn't be allowed to pick how heavily they want to treat it. So their life isn't a unmanageable mess, it's just worse than it should/could be. There's a pill they could have to give them a better quality of life, and they can't have it because they're not bad enough? That doesn't sit well with me.  At the same time, there's something profoundly unnerving about feeding people mind-alerting drugs to make their lives nicer when they aren't going to die/completely fall apart without them.

And I'm not sure why it's only psych medication that produces that feeling. Because it affects our thought process? Perhaps. Caffeine, sleeping pills, alcohol, your diet, exercise, the music you listen to, etc, all produce noticeable changes in thought processes, why do they not generally get treated with the same unease/stigma by society? Many people are miserable people you don't want to be around without their caffeine, that's pretty major in my book, but that's still ""normal"".

Overall, I guess I'm in favor of encouraging society and people to try to integrate/find a place that they are happy with without needing medication or without as high of a dose, but also making it available to those who have the disorder at however heavily they wish to treat it with medication. (within normal dosage/doctor's orders).",0,1355487107,null,0,false,0,c7ggbdp,t3_14sq1h,t1_c7ggbdp,t1_c7gfpt8,null,1430671449,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I'm using a media center called Boxee Box, and a VPN service called Witopia (29 dollars a year, great service). I set the VPN directly in the Boxee Box. Then I can acess a lot of TV shows directly : the Boxee Box finds them on the net and mix them with my own collection. Also, I have the Netflix App and I managed to have a Netflix US subscription. In the end, it's super inexpensive but I have a great choice of programs to watch.

When I'm in the USA and want to watch French TV, news or sports on the net or through Boxee Box replay apps, I just set the VPN to Paris servers (they have servers all over the world) and I can have access.

I didn't know HBO was $15... I would consider it indeed.

With all that, I still download a lot of torrents, because it can be automatic and very convenient. But I'm also paying for a lot of on-demand movies... when it's not exceeding 4,99.

&gt; The relative ease with which a young communist could be converted into a Nazi or vice-versa was well known, best of all to the propagandists of the two parties.

Their practice showed how closely they are related. To both, the real enemy, the man with whom they had nothing in common, was the liberal of the old type. While Nazis, communists and socialists are potential recruits made of the right timber for each othre, they all know that there can be no compromise between them and those who really believe in individual freedom.

**H**


[Wikipédia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_(s%C3%A9rie_t%C3%A9l%C3%A9vis%C3%A9e)), [exemple épisode](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xvduu_une-histoire-de-pere-s02e16_fun#.UMsxyrsmaU4). 


Cette sitcom est très connue en France et a propulsé de nombreux comédiens au rang de star nationales (Jamel, Eric &amp; Ramzy). Elle raconte l'histoire de quelques infirmiers dans un hôpital, leurs plaisanteries, leurs humeurs, leurs fautes professionnelles. Elle est très vieille mais toujours rigolote à regarder.








**Caméra Café**


[Wikipédia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam%C3%A9ra_Caf%C3%A9_(s%C3%A9rie_t%C3%A9l%C3%A9vis%C3%A9e,_2001)), [exemple épisode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPRXAU78cFM). 


Une série télévisée humoristique avec des épisodes très brefs (3 minutes chacun environ). Filmée à caméra unique qui est intégrée dans la machine à café d'une entreprise, elle nous narre les histoires de ses employés durant leurs pauses café. Les personnages sont tous très caricaturaux et c'est pour cela que l'on aime cette série.








**Un Gars, Une Fille.**


[Wikipédia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un_gars,_une_fille_(s%C3%A9rie_t%C3%A9l%C3%A9vis%C3%A9e,_1999)), [exemple épisode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPRXAU78cFM)


Série humoristique de six minutes par épisode. Elle raconte les aventures d'un couple, Jean, macho gros dragueur (caricature du *gars*) et Alexandra, pipelette maniaque (caricature de la *fille*) dans des situations banales ou complexes. Elle est célèbre pour avoir propulsé la carrière de Jean Dujardin et très plaisante à regarder.








**Norman Fait des Vidéos**


[Wikipédia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_fait_des_vid%C3%A9os), [exemple vidéo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHQCvSbHW-k).


Norman fait des vidéo est le podcast Youtube de Norman Thavaud, jeune homme qui fait des vidéos racontant sa vie, ses déboires. Extrêmement populaire auprès des jeunes, le succès de la série est dû au fait que le public s'analyse souvent à Norman.








**Very Bad Blagues**


[Wikipédia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Bad_Blagues), [exemple vidéo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdeWE6zwpE).


Série diffusée à la base sur Direct 8 mais regardable sur Youtube. Elle imagine des scénarios improbables à toute sorte de situation donnée au début de l'épisode.








**Joueur du Grenier**


[Wikipédia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joueur_du_Grenier), [exemple épisode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwGj63He0o).


Si tu es geek et que tu aimes bien AVGN, cette série est faite pour toi. Joueur du Grenier aime bien tester de vieux jeux (souvent mauvais) et fait des sketchs suite à sa colère.

Replying to all comments below.

* Ignorance is not stupidity. Calm down.

* The EU is our neighbourhood. Our country is our house. We take care of both. Both enhance our quality of life. The EU allows us all to speak louder in the international scene.

* Please, do yourself a favour and read about the Euromyths. Many UK media and politicians should be ashamed. They spread lies.

&gt; Wir nehmen das Unfallrisiko in Kauf weil Fahren toll ist, aber wir akzeptieren keine religiösen Ausnahmen, weil es keine Ausnahmen gibt.

Klar gibt's religiöse Ausnahmen. Die Frage ist doch nur, wie weit die gehen dürfen. Wir sind uns einig, daß Jungfrauenopfer auch dann verboten sein sollten, wenn sie religiös motiviert sind. Und genauso sind wir uns einig, daß alberne Hüte tragen immer erlaubt sein sollte, unabhängig von der Motivation. Das sind die beiden Extreme, und dazwischen muß irgendwo eine Grenze zur Illegalität gezogen werden.

Und diese Grenze erscheint eben etwas schräg, wenn das kupieren von Hundeschwänzen verboten ist, aber das kupieren von Menschenschwänzen ausdrücklich per Gesetz erlaubt.

Das war sehr populistisch formuliert, entschuldigung, kann man nicht miteinander vergleichen, muß man Studien durchführen und Statistiken interpretieren und alles, seh ich ein.

&gt; The Treaty of Utrecht did not specify territorial waters. By the first half of the 18th century, the concept of the 3-nautical-mile (5.6 km)-wide sovereign territorial sea emerged and was eventually adopted by most countries as the basis of marine jurisdiction, **until the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, which entered into force in 1995, set a new standard of 12 nautical miles (22 km)**. British Gibraltar Territorial Waters currently extend up to 3 nautical miles. Spain included a declaration, the content of which was rejected by the UK. The Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Peter Caruana noted that ""Spain subscribed to that treaty, making no reservation whatsoever in relation to the Gibraltar question. **International law makes Spain's denial of territorial waters in Gibraltar completely unsustainable in law..**

true,zekraut,flag-de,,"Ich pflege keinen Hass auf Politiker, Regierungen oder Religionen. Ich stehe aber zu Werten wie Gerechtigkeit und halte unser Grundgesetz für eine gute Sache. 
Nochmal: Mir ist durchaus bewusst, dass die Beschneidung so tief im jüdischen Glauben verankert ist, das sie fester Bestandteil der jüdischen Religion und Kultur ist. Ich sehe hier im wesentlichen zwei Probleme:
Zum einen stellt eine Beschneidung nun mal eine Verletzung der Grundrechte eines Kindes dar - das können wir drehen und wenden wie wir wollen, es bleibt eine Grundrechtsverletzung. Nun könnte man diesem reinen juristischen Tatbestand genüge tun, in dem man (analog zur Abtreibung) dieses zwar als Straftat bewertet, es aber nicht verfolgt. Damit wäre dem Geist des Grundgesetzes genüge getan und die Beschneidung wäre ohne weitere Probleme möglich. Stattdessen aber bricht man mit diesem Kniefall nicht nur das Recht auf körperliche Unversertheit sondern verletzt auch den Gleichheitsartikel des Grundgesetzes: Beschneidung von Mädchen (auch eine Klitorisvorhautreduktion, welche ebenfalls keine gesundheitlichen Nachteile bietet und praktisch identisch zur Beschneidung bei Jungen ist) bleibt verboten. 
Der Gesetzgeber hat schlicht und ergreifend nicht das Recht, Artikel des Grundgesetzes zu brechen (was er hier tut) und da beide Artikel vom Ewigkeitsparagraphen geschützt werden, kann er sie auch nicht ändern. Dieses Gesetz ist nicht nur handwerklicher Müll, sondern auch sehr dreist und unverschämt, da es einfach unvereinbar mit dem GG ist.

P.S.: Natürlich sind solche Dinge kulturell behaftet. Nur wo ziehst du da die Grenze? Ist die Gleichstellung von Mann und Frau für dich auch eine kulturelle Sache? Die Meinungsfreiheit? Die Freizügigkeit? Scheidungsrecht? Ich denke, das GG bietet einen guten gemeinsamen Nenner, auf den sich alle hier lebenden Menschen verständigen sollten.

Ja, natürlich. Genauso wie die Vorteile.

&gt; Ich glaube nicht dass man dazu aussagekräftige Studien anfertigen kann, da es sich nicht um ein wissenschaftliches sondern politisches Thema handelt

Naja, man kann durchaus untersuchen, bei wievielen Beschneidungen Komplikationen auftreten und wie schwerwiegend sie sind. Die Vorteile erscheinen mir etwas schwieriger zu beziffern, aber das geht auch, hat man ja laut Wikipedia auch schon gemacht.

 Aber klar, wenn man von vornherein sagt, daß einen die Ergebnisse nicht interessieren, kann man sich die Studien auch sparen. Dann kann man aber auch Jungfrauenopfern nichts entgegensetzen - Daten, Fakten und rationale Einschätzungen sind ja egal, alles was zählt sind dominante Meinungen.

&gt; und ich glaube auch nicht, dass ""deine Freiheit hört auf wo meine anfängt..."" ein Absolut ist, sondern eher ein Richtwert.

Sowieso. Dogmen sind grundsätzlich gefährlich, weil sie einen dazu verleiten, den Bezug zu konkreten Umständen zu verlieren. Das gilt allerdings auch für religiöse Dogmen. Ich versteh zum Beispiel nicht, inwiefern mein Penis meinen Glauben dermaßen grundsätzlich beeinflussen kann. Aber ich hab auch keine Ahnung von Religionen und laß mich da gerne aufklären.

&gt; noch recht komfortabel im Bereich des moralisch akzeptablen

Und das versteh ich eben nicht. Säuglinge werden Risiken ausgesetzt, deren Notwendigkeit sich einzig daraus ergibt, daß sie Eltern mit einem bestimmten Glauben haben.

The problem lies within the household and the behavioral issues that are provoked.  Poor parenting, ""undisciplined child"", and then poor performance in class - there is a pattern there and it's caused more rather than created at birth.  Adderall should not be the first attempt at fixing behavioral issues.  That is why there are social workers in the world. 

To me, the idea of diagnosing a child at the age of 6 with ADHD and prescribing medicine is ridiculous and a cop out for parents who don't know how to raise their child. But unfortunately it happens and at a high rate. 

Edit:  I do believe ADHD/ADD is genetic but that doesn't stop kids, who simply have behavioral issues from bad parenting, from being prescribed to adderall and other medications as well.

Ricordo al liceo, l'insegnante di latino ci fece tradurre una versione che raccontava la leggenda della nascita del Po.

Più o meno raccontava che Apollo, dopo una notte di gozzoviglie e libagioni, si abbiocca alle redini del suo carretto col sole (immaginatevi quello di Pollon e tutto sembrerà più divertente), al punto di sbandare e avvicinarsi pericolosamente alla terra. Si sveglia quando il carro tocca con una ruota il terreno collinare, riesce a riprendere quota, ma guardandosi indietro vede l'area completamente bruciata e appiattita. Allora le Ninfe, per riparare al danno, creano una sorgente che da vita a un grande corso d'acqua che spegne le fiamme e riporta la nuova pianura ad essere un terreno fertile e accogliente. Il corso d'acqua è il Po e la pianura è la pianura padana.

true,Kim147,UKGB,United Kingdom Thanks,"Only problem is France happily picks and chooses what EU laws and regulations it will abide by . 

Internet gambling is a classic example . Under EU law France is supposed to allow free trade from other EU states . If an Internet gambling site is operating from an EU country outside France it is prohibited by French law and regulation from operating in France unless it gets permission from France des Jeux - essentially their gaming commission . France has been prosecuted several times in the European court over this and lost each time but it still refuses to abide by EU law in this regard . 

Euromillions operates in this regard in effect on a national basis - non French citizens are prohibited from buying Euromillions tickets from their national sites from within France .

France is not alone in picking and choosing what EU laws and regulations it will abide by . Employment law has been ignored by a number of countries with regards new member countries citizens . Free trade law is often ignored when it applies to contract services.

you say:  ""If people want to segregate themselves, they will, regardless of the design of the house"". if that is the case, the muslim men should have never been consulted about their wishes and furthermore should have acted with modesty fitting a person applying for social - government backed - housing. if the muslim pays to build a house he can design so that he would only has to see his wife in the bedroom and nowhere else. if he relies on handouts he should thank allah for a roof above his head.

Not a smart move. A *private* college that let people *without the baccalauréat* enrol ? It is a scam, as much as the online universities in the US.

The title ""Young French Losing Hope as Prospects Fade"" made think the article would be about something that was in fact not addressed, but says much more about French prospects : ""achiever"" youth feels the same i.e. even top students think French labour market will never recover, and that they should go. I have a friend in a very competitive CPGE (LLG) : him and his classmates all want to leave France later on to have better prospects. It is quite the same in my university. People want out to Germany (low birth rate + growth = open jobs to come), to the US, to the Brazil or the US or whatever but France. I am yet to meet someone who is not ""losing hope"" in France.

Over seas in general I feel like a lot of jobs start with apprenticeships and I think that is great. I wish there was equal attention put on learning new knowledge and practicing on the job, side by side. Most great chefs didn't go to culinary school, but there has been a surge of students going so I think that might change soon.

Now, how to describe my classmates... I will speak in grave exaggeration so keep in mind there are few cool people, but  a lot of them bummed around after high school and their parents just sent them away for school because they liked making cookies after school once a month with friends. They skip class or are completely disrespectful to chefs during class, have no idea what is going on in the culinary world, much less the country they are going back to, and hurry to get out of class to go drink with their parents money and get nothing out of school. Now, this makes me sound like an uptight asshole, but its just not fair to some other kids. For example, you have an opportunity to take a break between one of your three terms and be an assistant. You dont go to class but you work in the prep kitchen and then are the assistant to chefs during class. These are the hardest working people I've ever known, they want to be there, they want to be kicked around by the chefs so that they can learn more and get better at simple things. And I don't mean to focus on money because my parents are lending me part of the money to attend, but you can usually tell who is paying their own way and who is just blowing trust fund money to waste time.

Planes: Same thing minus the lungs but with the addition of general ""*high-altitude-cosmic-rays*"" cancers.



Alcohol: The result of any act where alcohol played a major part, gory pictures of liver damage, of falling over, of DUI accidents, of rapes or fights or the battering of women/children committed while drunk...

Sea-food, tuna etc: Dolphin slaughters!

Any plastic product, water bottles etc: Pictures of turtles, dissected sea-birds that died of ingesting discarded spastics.

I hate them because they have different and obviously inferior teeth so I really am a teethist. Which is clearly some bullshit philosophical term that is nowhere near as negatively impregnated as ""racism"".

The issue is really about dumb people who can't get it through their fucking heads that racism is a term that has long grown over just being about race. Not only because the concept of ""race"" is as unscientific and undefinable as ""culture"" but also because racists have a great motivation to do anything in their bullshit power to not be called racists. They get more recognition posing as something ""completely"" different. 

&gt; I'm not racist, I hate people for *REAL* reasons, get it?

People are different, there will always be new fucking distinctive bullshit terms. When antimulticulturalism becomes loaded negatively they will probably just jump on the next one. Neo-nazis got smart and stopped using distinct clothes and styles. They started using mass culture and modern average shit to get across and it worked wonders for their cause. The people who want to destroy democracy cry the hardest when someone tries to take their ""rights"" away.

It is about a [press release](https://www.dbwv.de/C125747A001FF94B/vwContentByKey/W292VCCP979DBWNDE/$FILE/PM_201227.pdf)[PDF] and [radio interview](http://www.inforadio.de/programm/schema/sendungen/int/201212/11/182598.html) by the German Bundeswehr Association ([dbwv](https://www.dbwv.de/)), which tells that:

* it is not sure that the Bundeswehr has enough Patriot rockets for a (full scale) conflict (without having to rely on NATO allies)

* it is not clear what kind of additional ABC (nuclear, biological and chemical) defense is to be implemented (if Syria uses chemical weapons)

These points are mentioned since on Monday the German parliament, the Bundestag, talks about the deployment. Thus it is more a politcal statement to gather support within the German politicianship than a statement of preparedness. What the Bundeswehrverband (Bundeswehr association) wants is a NBC at the border.

Currently there will be a deployment of two troops for the patriot stations, however it would be possible to get an anti chemical warfare troop onto the border (one of [those](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC-Abwehrtruppe_%28Bundeswehr%29#Aktive_Truppenteile)). However the deploymenttime is really low anyhow as there are already some more ABC, object safety and antiaircraft defense regiments activated.

*Edit*  
I just read about what is planed. The German troops will be put onto certain points onto the Syrian-Turkish border to intercept missles, (have an eye on Turkish-Kurdish incidents) and help the AWACS (which are also going to be stationed) to scout the regions and further map the actual used communications and troops by the Syrian / Rebel forces. This is one of the first steps for air operations. AWACS did also operate within the last year in areas coincidentally close enough to the conflict to gather some intelligence within Syria.

In my eyes the deployment is also a safeguard to reduce the possibility of a national Turkish oriented offense. If you remember the incident about a bombed village within the Turkish border which provoked some artillery fire by Turkish battalions and also some operations from the Turkish army against Kurdish (or PKK if you as them) targets within Syria.",0,1355529356,null,0,1355539159,0,c7gr4cu,t3_14ujq2,t1_c7gr4cu,t3_14ujq2,null,1430676704,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

As I said in my other post, I know. I also addressed the point that German troops, just like those from many other nations, were sent to Afghan on the basis that they essentially get to stick to the safe parts where little happens.

**Pressemitteilung der Initiative in Gedenken an Oury Jalloh e.V. vom 12.12.2012**

Oury Jalloh – Von Polizisten ermordet, vom Staat vertuscht!

Die Aufklärung der Todesursache von Oury Jalloh durch Staatsanwaltschaft und Gericht erneut gezielt verhindert!

Urteilsverkündung am 13. Dezember 2012 um 14.30 Uhr am Magdeburger Landgericht

Als „eine Zumutung“ bezeichnete der Nebenklagevertreter Philipp Napp das Festhalten dervMagdeburger Kammer an der Selbstentzündungshypothese des Staatsanwaltes Christian
Preissner. Nach knapp 2 Jahren will die vorsitzende Richterin Claudia Methling das Revisionsverfahren gegen den Angeklagten, den damaligen Dienstgruppenleiter Andreas Schubert, an höchstbrisanter Stelle einfach abbrechen. Angesichts einer neuen, erdrückenden Beweislast, die deutlich für die Ermordung Oury Jallohs spricht, ist das Vorgehen der Magdeburger Richter ein zweifelloser Beleg dafür, dass in Sachsen – Anhalt eine gerichtliche Aufklärung der Todesursache ganz bewusst nicht gewollt ist. Methling und Preissner
klammern sich an die Anklageschrift und behaupten ernsthaft, dass es nicht mehr möglich wäre, den Grund für den Brandausbruch zu ermitteln.

**„Man braucht keine Verschwörungstheorien um festzustellen, dass etwas nicht stimmt“**, führte Nebenklagevertreterin Gabriele Heinecke in ihrem Plädoyer aus. Wieso gibt Staatsanwalt Preissner vor, ein Vorprüfungsverfahren eingeleitet zu haben, obwohl er in seinem Plädoyer davon sprach, nach wie vor keine Anhaltspunkte für Mord zu sehen?
Ein komplexes Lügengespinnst wurde um den Tod von Oury Jalloh konstruiert. Als Anwalt des Vaters von Oury Jalloh trägt Philipp Napp in seinem Plädoyer die wichtigsten Fragen
zusammen, die sich in den letzten Monaten prozessual aus der Indizienlage ergeben haben:

- **Woher kommt das Feuerzeug? Es ist keine DNA von Oury Jalloh, keine Stoff- und Faserreste seiner Kleidung oder der Matratze, auf der er lag, am Feuerzeugrest nachweisbar!**

- **Ein Undokumentierter Aufenthalt der Polizisten Hans-Ulrich März und Udo Scheibe in der Zelle 5, in welcher Oury Jalloh von denselben Beamten einige Stunden zuvor an Händen und Füssen gefesselt worden war! Ein Kollege hatte die beiden dort eine halbe Stunde vor Brandausbruch angetroffen. Was haben die beiden bei Oury Jalloh gemacht?**

- **Warum sind zentrale Beweismittel verschwunden? (verschwunden sind unter anderem: die rechte Handfessel, ein 8 cm langes Stoffstück, dass unter dem Kopf von Oury Jalloh gefunden wurde, das entscheidende Videomaterial der Tatortgruppe, das Fahrtenbuch von März und Scheibe, der entsprechende Journaleintrag wurde auf mysteriöse Weise gelöscht, ein Gesprächsvermerk, in welchem es um das öffentlich bekannte rassistische Vorgehen der Dessauer Polizei ging).**

- **Wie ist das Auffinden Situation von Oury Jalloh zu erklären? Abgebrannte Matratzenecken, Amputation der Finger der linken Hand, Stoffreste unter Oury Jallohs Hinterkopf, unbekleidete Brust, vorgeführte Hosenreste passen nicht zu den Verbrennungen seines Gesäßes.**

- **Warum wurde bei einem derart wichtigen Ereignis am Tatort kein Fotoionendetektor eingesetzt?**

- **Wie ist die Abwesenheit von Noradrenalin erklärbar? Die Kammer geht darüber hinweg, dass Oury Jalloh bewusstlos gewesen sein muss. Noradrenalin entsteht bei
Stress und ist innerhalb von 10 – 30 Sekunden im Urin nachweisbar**

- **Hat der Andreas Schubert Oury Jalloh am 7. Januar 2005 lebend gesehen? Schubert bestreitet dies, obwohl mehrere Zeugenaussagen davon berichteten, dass der Angeklagte im Gewahrsamsbereich war.**

Das Schweigen des Gerichtes hinsichtlich der Beantwortung dieser Fragen und das ignorante und boshafte Verhalten der Richterin sind weitere schwere Demütigungen der Familie und der Freunde von Oury Jalloh, die seit fast 8 Jahren die Aufklärung der Todesursache fordern.

Warum darf dies nach insgesamt 4 Prozessjahren nicht geschehen?

Indem verantwortliche Personen des damaligen Innenministeriums Sachsen – Anhalts die Ermittlungsausrichtung im Fall Oury Jalloh auf die unglaublichste aller möglichen Brandursachen – die Selbstentzündungshypothese – beschränkten, sollte darüber hinweggetäuscht werden, dass in der Polizeidienststelle Dessau Menschen in Gewahrsam umgebracht werden. **Dieses Revier war bekannt für seinen „harten Umgang mit Ausländern“, zudem gab es zwei weitere, bis heute ungeklärte Todesfälle: Ein Herr Rose wurde alkoholisiert von der Polizei im Park aufgegriffen und in Gewahrsam verbracht. Am Morgen lag er tot vor einem Hochhaus, zu welchem er keine persönliche Beziehung hatte. Der obdachlose Mario Bichtemann kam in der gleichen Zelle ums Leben, wie Oury Jalloh. Nach mehrstündiger Ingewahrsamnahme wurde er mit einem Schädelbruch aufgefunden. Leitender Dienstgruppenleiter war an diesem Tag ebenfalls Andreas Schubert.**

**Wenn es nichts zu verbergen gibt, warum lässt sich das Gericht nicht auf Brandversuche mit Brandbeschleunigern ein?** Zwei Menschen sterben in ein und derselben Zelle auf ungeklärte Weise und die Justiz in Sachsen – Anhalt verschließt die Augen?

Der Mord an Oury Jalloh soll vertuscht werden, zu groß wären der Skandal und der Imageschaden für Sachsen-Anhalt damals wie heute. Auf Anweisung des Innenministeriums
wurden alle Ermittlungsausrichtungen auf die Selbstentzündungsthese, die unglaublichste aller Erklärungen für den Brandausbruch, beschränkt. Ein rassistischer Mord, begangen durch Dessauer Polizeibeamte, wurde – und wird – durch die höchsten Instanzen Sachsen-Anhalts gedeckt.

Ein ungeheuerlicher Rechtsstaat! Ein rechtsstaatliches Ungeheuer!

So, who still enslaves rival groups and tribes to this day?

Fun facts: 

The British abolished Slavery in the 1700s  
The first slave owner in America (and the one who fought for the legalization of slavery) was black.  
Both America and Britain had their navy attack slave ships and slave traders since the early 1800s.    
The Arabs were responsible for the largest slave trade in history.   
It's always been very common for white Christians to go around the world, Africa in particular, and set up schools and hospitals and water wells and other aid/relief stations.   
Throughout all of history there has always been white people fighting against white people for the benefit of non-whites, philosophers in Spain, sanctions against Belgium, etc.    
Please, let me know any other people in the world who've tried to help anywhere near the extent that whites have.   ",0,1355540748,null,0,false,0,c7gtrcv,t3_14oq15,t1_c7gtrcv,t1_c7gtb64,null,1430677943,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

That said, kids may not be interested in a lot of stuff, but just the sightseeing (there are many places to be seen, but with kids.. it's not really their thing usually and unfortunately.) and maybe a ""bateau mouche"" (tourist boats that go on a tour of paris from the Seine) can take you a long time, and must be done (this includes the eiffel tower, your kids might not want to go too high (there are 3 levels), but as that kid that did not want to go to high, I wish my parents would have convinced me :P (telling them it is safe might be a good start, and if you have a nice weather, the view is a must-see)          
Also, from memories from my childhood, and something that I remember the most is a science expo/museum, with a part for children that is really well made, and a really good way to drag them to a ""museum"" without them knowing, getting them interested in science, and most of all, having fun while learning (which is often claimed, but rarely accomplished).         
[La cité des sciences](http://www.cite-sciences.fr/en/cite-des-sciences/contenu/c/1248107525733/cite-des-enfants/)          
Also, the exhibit seems to be in english as well :)          

Have you (or your wife) ever been to Paris before ?        
As for the outside of Paris part, there are a lot of nice places to go, but indeed your kids will love the beach, which leaves you fewer choices, you can go North, Trouville-Deauville is a nice town, a bit ""upscale"" and expensive, but you're never really sure of the weather, you can go to the west to the ocean, but it's usually a safer bet to go to the mediterannée with kids, more sun, and hotter water. The best beach I know of is the one near perpignan (really long fine sand, no rocky beach)
canet-plage.net/   (exemple of the beach in canet, and it is also a good exemple of the price for a no road to cross-right on the beachfront  2 bedrooms, small kitchen, and a view of the beach, town and mountains from a panoramic balcony. 340 to 450 a week depending on when)            
Once there, the beach is usually enough to occupy 2 children, but in case it's not, there are a lot of other things to do : renting a sailing boat (it can get windy, which makes this really fun), waterpark, putt putt golf (small golf), climbing on trees park (sorry, I do not have any idea how to translate that, Accrobranche or Grimpalarbre in google to get an idea (both are brands)), Spain is only about 2 hours away, so a quick trip there can be good for the cultural side of the trip for the kids (there is a small in between borders town called Perthus(french side) and La Joncquera(Spanish side) which has a lot of ""duty free"" shops, the place to buy stuff, and a lot of little things the kids like to look at (and then ask you 10€ for :P), and a few restaurents with spanish traits (but it's best to go a bit farther for that).

The problem with European multiculturalism is how extreme it is from both sides. You have a minority within the minority praising sexism/intolerance under the guise of multiculturalism and then you have a majority reject entire cultures because of minority opinions, which in term makes everyone in that culture insular and makes those opinions prevalent.

Instead, I understood the question to be about taking ""study drugs,"" that is, ADHD stimulant drugs without a prescription or valid medical reason for it.

I think the reason has something to do with the American culture and our love of instant gratification and the cheap or ""easy"" way. McDonald's and other fast food is an example of this. Why bother to buy hamburger meat, grill it, slice pickles and cheese, and put this all onto a bun when you can get the whole thing for $1 in the drive-through, with no dishes to wash up afterwards?

Our educational system feeds into this mentality, as well. We're teaching our children that success is something that just happens because they deserve it. ""Oh, you read at a fifth-grade level, but you've spent so much time in school, so let's just call it all good and give you a high-school diploma anyway.""

Many American students who take ""study drugs"" do so to compensate for the fact that they never learned proper study skills or how to accomplish things solely on their own merit. Their concept of university is a series of parties and one-night encounters, with the occasional unpleasant schoolwork thrown in that can be all done on the day it is due.

ADHD diagnoses are much more prevalent here, as well, so stimulant drugs are much easier to come by, also. I think this may be due a combination of factors, from genetics, to environment, to the criteria used to diagnose the disorder. But that is a somewhat separate topic.

Personally, I didn't know anyone that took study drugs, (at least that they told me.) But this was because I went first to a community college, where nobody cared what their grades were, then went to a state university where you had to actually study and plan your whole quarter out in advance. All-nighters were not possible for most people because most students worked and had families.

true,veevax,IDF,Ile-de-France,"I can not disagree with Frenchydude, on the advantages of Perpignan and its neighbourhood. It is a beautiful region, and I really think that beaches are far better than Côte d'Azur's ones.

Howlingwolfpress is also right, as the two sister Islands Île de Ré and Île d'oléron are wonderful for hollidays with children : Huge beaches, little village with a lot of cycle paths. A lot of my childhood memories are linked to these places, and it is really cool. (Île de Ré is unfortunately an expensive place...)

But, as I lived both in Paris and on the Côte d'Azur, I will give you my insights in a hope that it will help you, if you have to chose between this two places.

Côte d'Azur is similar to Perpignan in that it is really near a foreign country. Italy is really next door, and it influences the cultur of the region, and in particular the gastronomy. Nice's specialities are based on olive oil and mediterranean vegetables, and are really linked to the ""apéritif"" (Alcoholic beverages and little pieces of food that are to dinner, what foreplay is to sex.) [Pétanque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A9tanque) with friends and a few drinks is almost an ""art de vivre"".

The landscapes are wonderful and vary a lot. Ski resorts are at a 1h30 drive away from Sophia Antipolis, there is a lot of wonderful places to go hiking, the beaches are big enough in June and September (Not in July and August, as I said before, but you have the possibility to go on some little rivers like [Verdon](http://www.alpes-haute-provence.com/geographie/verdon.htm) or Loup.). 

It seems a bit dumb to say that, but the ""light"" is wonderful. It is why a lot of painters during the 20th came to paint in this region. Picasso, Matisse and Giacometti have left a lot of pieces of art in the museums of Nice, Antibes and Saint Paul de Vence. All are wonderful.

I also tried to began to learn sailing, unfortunately, la Méditerranée is not very helpful, and there is almost always too much or too few wind for a beginner.

I loved this region, but I also missed Paris, and I came back to Paris at the very beginning of this year.

This is why...

As a single young man, I found it difficult during the winter to meet new peoples and to find a lot of varied cultural events. The Côte d'Azur is particularly ""alive"" during the summer, but a bit at rest during the Winter.

Paris is a wonderful city, and I had a lot of friend there. I spend almost all my nights out of my flat, and I love it. I do not have to own a car, which is mandatory on Côte d'Azur. 

There is always something new to do, or to see: an exhibition, a concert, a new bar, a new restaurant. 

Each district has its own personnality, and it is always fun to go and discover a new place.

But, I am not sure that the experience is the same when you have two little children. Even if la Cité des Sciences, la Galerie de l'Evolution or Disneyland are great places.

Sorry, but when it comes to children, we hit the boundaries of my own experience. However, as a child, I think, that I would prefer la Côte d'Azur.

Hope it helps.

i do not accept the normative use of the phrase as an acceptable basis for gov't policy in britain:

""Multiculturalism relates to communities containing multiple cultures. The term is used in two broad ways, either descriptively or normatively.[1] As a descriptive term, it usually refers to the simple fact of cultural diversity: it is generally applied to the demographic make-up of a specific place, sometime at the organizational level, e.g. schools, businesses, neighbourhoods, cities, or nations. As a normative term, it refers to ideologies or policies that promote this diversity or its institutionalisation; in this sense, multiculturalism is a society “at ease with the rich tapestry of human life and the desire amongst people to express their own identity in the manner they see fit.”[2] Such ideologies or policies vary widely, including country to country,[3] ranging from the advocacy of equal respect to the various cultures in a society, to a policy of promoting the maintenance of cultural diversity, to policies in which people of various ethnic and religious groups are addressed by the authorities as defined by the group they belong to.""

do as you will elsewhere, but the argument is already won here when miliband gave his speech on immigration saying: he is proud of “multiethnic, diverse britain,” but made no mention of multiculturaism.

alongside a new enthusiasm for integration we might finally have a sensible consensus on immigration.

Most of what the European Court of Human Rights interferes with are not even human rights, at least not to your average Briton.

I'm much more concerned about our countrymen and not whether foreign tourists are going to have ""human rights"" or not. Parliament makes laws, not European judges.

&gt;There are EU directives I don't like, such as the cookie policy, but I don't think that's a fair enough reason to leave entirely - if nothing else, it's a compelling reason to start paying attention to European Parliament elections, which nobody in Britain seems to (except the fascists, hence how people like Nick Griffin get in).

I see it as a compelling reason to leave. I do follow European politics and I never see anything I can support. It's just more and more useless regulation. They have a particular love for passing these laws with the hope of stopping ""climate change"" or helping ""minorities"".

&gt;The last criticism I saw of the European Convention on Human Rights was a front-page story on the Scots equivalent of the Daily Mail that was angered about how it stopped some police department from carrying tasers.

That's your opinion, but I would rather elected representatives had a say in it rather than a foreign court.

It forces countries to lower their ""carbon emissions"" which is basically an attempt to de-industrialise. It makes absolutely no sense to start crippling our economy to help lower carbon emissions when we have so many unemployed people and massive economic problems. Even if you believe in lowering emissions then you have to agree that it's futile, China will replace all of our cuts in emissions with a massive increase in emissions.

If they teach in muslims countries surely then the muslims shouldn't have a problem with it in the west.


And wasn't the guy who came up with the earliest evolution theory a descendent of the Prophet?

&gt;Among scholars of Islam İbrahim Hakkı of Erzurum who lived in Erzurum then Ottoman Empire now Republic of Turkey in 18th century is famous of stating 'between plants and animals there is sponge, and, between animals and humans there is monkey'.

No politician can take these rights away.

Every party that opposes the FdGO can be forbidden, however, the rules are quite strict. Just two parties have been forbidden so far (a direct successor of the NSDAP and a from Moscow directed communist party). 
The problem with the NPD is, that they are not only neglecting same human rights for all citizens and are openly opposing democratic structures, but they have also some Shock-troops trying to control certain areas in east Germany. 

When the supreme court banned the communist party, they defined exactly these two criteria: Being against the FdGO and showing an aggressive and fighting attitude.

I doubted the conclusions they drew from the answers, especially when people answered that they partially agree with those statements.

What I said about Herrn Rösler is certainly not my position either,  it is what I perceived (maybe unfairly) to be the modus operandi of the CDU. And yes, although Herr Rössler is of course German, he is the token foreigner in the current cabinet and the press and public won't stop talking about. Of course he doesn't come with his own cultural perspective, mostly because he never knew it, being adopted as baby. But this is exactly the kind of foreigner / person with migrational background the conservatives can accept. In contrast to e.g. someone like Cem Özdemir.

Why not just lower taxes across the board instead of subsidising certain areas selected by the government? History has shown that the private sector is better at allocating resources than the state, here in Portugal we've taken massive amounts of money from the private sector and allowed the government to have a large role in the economy and look where it has led us... What we need is to free resources to be used by the private sector, not keep fooling ourselves believing that the state can do better than millions of individuals working in their self-interest.

Austerity is a bitter medicine but in the long run it will work. The problem we currently face is not excessive austerity but rather the lack of it. Taxes have gone up and so has government spending... Austerity should be focused on reducing spending and taxes and plain and simple that isn't happening.

It is about the endeavor to ban the right-extreme party NPD (nationaldemocratic party germany) the closest thing Germany has to a spiritual successor to the NSDAP -- if you ask their members under four eyes. 

Besides the NPD there was another right-wing party active on the federal level the DVU (German Volks-union) which had virtually no relevancy -- a ban on this party was not attempted -- till it fusioned wiht the NPD last year.

On the country-level there are some right-radical parties and organizations. The former are for example called Pro-Sachsen (Pro Saxonia e.g. Pro-Texas), the later are mostly Freie Kameradschaften (violence oriented right extremist cells, structure oriented) and Autonome Nationalisten (violence oriented right extremist cells, action oriented) which try to adapt Antifacist organisational apearance to make it harder to distinguish the one from the other.

The last try to forbid the party did not fail because there was not enough reason to ban them, but the court decided it would need to know how much intelligency agencies were involved in organizing and planing the parties actions, thus ordered to give them the reports and agent lists. This was denied and the court decided it needed to know what kind of governmental involvement were present to ban, since this wasn't possible it dropped the case. The failure to ban it was in no way related to the actions or danger of the NPD, but because of politic's unwillingness to become clear.

This time after a series of murders with right wing connections and involvement of agents in the support networks, as well as how much money from the state went into the right extreme structures the politics of the Länder (German states) signalled it would be willing to give out the needed intelligence.

&gt;""Die **sozialen Eiferer** blenden aus, dass Mittelschicht nicht allein durch das Einkommen definiert ist.""

Das bedarf hoffentlich keiner Erläuterung.

Der stümperhafte Umgang mit Daten kommt zutage wenn die Autorin versucht die Definition des DIW zu wiederlegen mit dem Argument, dass man die Mittleschicht nicht nur über das Gehalt definieren kann. Genialer Geistesblitz den sie jedoch nicht auf die Studie von der KA-Stiftung anwendet. Man definiert die Mittelschicht über das Gehalt weil das nun mal ein sehr einfacher Indikator ist. Welche Indikatoren sollte man sonst verwenden? Bildungsstand? Den kann man genauso leicht zerpflücken, schließlich würde niemand sagen, dass man eine Universität besucht haben muss um Teil des Mittelstands zu sein. Letztlich wurde schon viel probiert um die Milieus genauer zu definieren aber man kommt immer wieder zu der sehr einfachen Unter-Mittel-Oberschicht Schematik zurück und aus gutem Grund.

Außerdem kann man seinen eigenen Standpunkt nicht untermauern indem man gegen andere Standpunkte argumentiert.

As for Barcelona, I did the trip a long time ago, it was a bit more than 2 hours but not much, and worth it to see this active and youthful city.
La Jonquera/Perthus is not too far, but 40 mins seems a bit short from Perpignan. Keep in mind you have to climb the mountains to get there (by a nice road, but it still climbs/twists a lot, the view is amazing, but prepare to stop a few times for the kids/wife, and have some gum handy or something to chew for the kids for the ears ^^)           
If you spend the second part of the holiday near Perpignan, be sure not to be in the city itself, prefer the beach towns which are 15-20 minutes away. You'll get stuck in the city traffic if you are housed there.         
And again, I do not know where you are from, but driving in Paris is like nothing else. Do not attempt it, especially if the wife is scared easily (if you do, I hope you're used to having 1 centimeter on each side of your car mirrors when you drive, because that's often how it is, with an unspoken rule of ""floor it"" if you want to get a chance to insert yourself when you don't have priority(5 lane roundabout is not a good way to drive on a roundabout for the first time :P), with bikers flying by from each side of your car, pedestrians everywhere, road signs everywhere with bus/taxi lines on the wrong side of the road, a lot of one way streets, and when trying to navigate a city to find where you are going with all of that happening, the wife trying to ""warn"" you every second that there are cars/bikes/people around, the kids that distract you, it's a risk that is a bit too big in my book. (also, the rules on the ""périphérique""(road that goes around the city of Paris) are unique, everywhere in france the person coming from your right has the priority, but when you try to engage in a highway the cars that are on that highspeed road have that priority, but on the ""périph"", you must let the person entering that road pass (or they will crash in your car and ask for insurance)) To resume that in one sentance, DO NOT attempt to drive in Paris.

Now I can engage in the same intellectual masturbation that a lot of Reddit likes to engage in, I often do in fact. Do the arguments against multiculturalism hold water? Yes, I think so. Do the arguments necessarily make the posters racist? No, I don't believe they do. Are the ones who post purely articles about Muslims probably just racists trying to promote their viewpoint?

You're right. I somehow misread it as meaning the debate won't involve members of Muslim community any more. As penance, I shall therefore downvote my own post.

true,mirered,null,null,"&gt; Why not save that money yourself? The government is incompetent and promises more than what it can realistically guarantee. With the current natality rate it is impossible to maintain social security in it's current state.

I disagree with that, before the state put the banking retirements on the Social security bill, the social security was viable for at least 30 more years. Now the government say it can only last for 7 more. So it's not that the program are viable in the long run (although i can agree adjustments need to be done due to the aging population), but it's the government mismanagement again of money that people paid them for their retirements, so again the government breaking the social contract.

&gt;  History has shown that the private sector is better at allocating resources than the state

Like what and when for example? And do you wanna trust your retirement and your health to the banks and private companies?  Especially in a monopolized economy like ours?

&gt; In a democracy the people are responsible for what their leadership does, therefore we are all responsible for empowering those parties who have followed reckless spending policies.

No, the leadership is elected to represent it's electorate, they should govern on what they promise on the campaign, which is why people voted for them. our government right now is going way beyond the troika's memorandum and doing things that they promised on campaign they never would do. They effectively lied to the people that elected them. 
I cannot explain why people voted constantly on the same 3parties, but the last election I'm sure no one though these guys were gonna turn into such a psychopaths. So no, People are not responsible for what the current government is doing that wasn't on their electoral program.
And if so, by your logic the people that didn't vote for them or didn't vote at all aren't responsible at all then?

&gt; Austerity is a bitter medicine but in the long run it will work. The problem we currently face is not excessive austerity but rather the lack of it. Taxes have gone up and so has government spending... Austerity should be focused on reducing spending and taxes and plain and simple that isn't happening.

It's not working because it makes no sense. The troika says fire 100.000 public servants. The government does, and says they'll save x amount of money, and they forget that those people don't disappear because they were fired. They will get unemployment, RSU maybe after that, and they won't pay taxes, and they will probably buy much less things and be another number for the increasing unemployment rate. 
You can't cut all spending and cut taxes and implement austerity all at the same time because austerity causes more spending for the social security. 
I think everyone wants spending cuts, on the actual non essential things, like the public-private partnerships, not on social safety nets.",0,1355597729,null,0,false,0,c7h2m0e,t3_14tpki,t1_c7h2m0e,t1_c7h16xu,null,1430682203,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
