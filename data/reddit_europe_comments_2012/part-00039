John and Mary bribed Peter, a state employee, in order to get their building permission faster than others. John and Mary shouldn't do that, and Peter shouldn't accept the money. But since John and Mary already paid the legal fees, the state didn't suffer much in financial terms.

Fritz and Katarina from Talos Warfare bribed Dimitri, a state employee, in order to sign a lucrative contract regarding army supplies. Their offer was higher than other offers, domestic and international, which had the same specifications. The state lost billions.

I'm not saying that X is right and Y is wrong, I'm putting things in context. There are priorities. If a state needs money, and needs it now, it should chase government contracts first. Spiegel, which is a German magazine, got it. That's all there is, hence the comment about fallacies.

true,sadscience,EURO,UK,"My feeling is that this is a good initiative for which the initial aims shouldn't be overstated. The Citizens' Initiative introduces a democratic input into a body (the Commission) that previously was far removed from most democratic influences and I think this should be praised. I'd argue it represents more of a ""safety valve"" type measure than a tool for major change.

People have mentioned the high amount of signatures needed and the problems collecting signatures in areas with different languages. The target of one million was deliberately set low (relatively - as mentioned it's ~0.2% of EU pop.) so as to facilitate signature gathering in difficult circumstances.

The actual power of the petitions is quite limited. The Commission can reject petitions if they do not fall within the scope of the Treaties or are particularly silly. I'd argue that this is pretty justified though. The Member States remain the keeper of the treaties and anything that the Commission proposes still has to go through the Council + EP. The Commission can't go proposing legislation that will result in major treaty change just because it has one million signatures behind it. The Commission remains fairly constrained in what it can propose legislation on, as the EU largely remains a regulatory union.

What it does do is introduce an important democratic input into a body that previously lacked any form of democratic influence and usually - I'd argue - was more strongly influenced by the stakeholder opinions of big business than citizens. If the Citizens' Initiative had been introduced earlier it would have been interesting to see a petition on ACTA handed straight to the Commission rather than the EP (as the AVAAZ petition and others were). I imagine it would have had a much greater influence than the limited input seen in stakeholder meetings, stakeholder opinions submitted by citizens' interest groups, and letter writing campaigns.",0,1333659557,null,0,false,0,c48xaef,t3_rrrgy,t1_c48xaef,t3_rrrgy,null,1428663222,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt;Dass man dadurch (illegale Downloads) dessen (eines Künstlers) Lebensgrundlage kappt, dürfte sich selbst Nerds erschließen.

Bitte was? *Selbst* Nerds? Die Unsinnigkeit dieser Aussage lässt sich schwer in Worte fassen. Erstens, der Ausdruck Nerds ist offensichtlich im Kontext alls Beleidigung gedacht, zweitens - bezüglich ""selbst"" - wieso sollte man annehmen dass ""Nerds"" dümmer sind als andere Leute? Und drittens: *Diese Person hat überhaupt keine Ahnung von den Vorsätzen der Piratenpartei.* Vorsatz der Partei ist, alle Werke im Internet öffentlich zugänglich zu machen und trotzdem Künstlern durch ihre Kreationen eine Lebensgrundlage zu sichern. 

Uninformiert einen beleidigenden Kommentar abzugeben ist einfach nur armselig, besonders für eine Person die sich den ""Nerds"" intellektuell überlegen fühlt.

Auch der Kommentar von Hens Hermann Tiedje, Ex-Bild Chefredakteur (also offensichtlich eine sehr intelligente Person) ist beeindruckend schlecht:

Natürlich ist Deutschland weit davon entfernt so extrem zu sein wie Amerika. Aber dort haben sie es immerhin geschafft, dass der Religionsunterreicht nichts in der Schule zu tun hat. Bei uns unterrichtet der Pfarrer schon die kleinen Kinder in der Schule, wie toll es doch ist ein Christ zu sein.

Name anything great about the Netherlands and the PVV is probably calling it a ""leftwing hobby"" and trying to destroy it. This would include anything to do with culture, society, social security, and acceptance of people such as yourself.

The PVV is not even a real party. It has no voting members and Geert Wilders is its absolute dictator. It is fundamentally antidemocratic. But, we have a minority government that depends on support from the PVV fraction in parliament. That means the PVV has disproportionate power over the government of this country even though they do not participate in it.

Being Turkish, you are probably a Muslim. The PVV hates Muslims with an especially fierce passion; they grew on a rabid anti-Muslim platform. They say Islam is not a religion but a ""backward culture"" that is out to destroy our superior civilization. They have proposed legislation to tax the wearing of headscarves in public, the ""headrag tax"" (kopvoddentaks). They have *actually succeeded* in banning face-covering garments. Freedom of religion is now officially dead here.

They are for a 100% halt on all immigration from ""Muslim countries"" including Turkey. If it were up to them, there would be no way for you to ever live in the Netherlands. Which would of course mean you couldn't vote for them. At least that's a plus.

Lately, they have aimed their arrows at Eastern Europeans. They have opened an ""Eastern Europeans Hotline"" that paints Eastern Europeans as drunks and criminals and allows people to anonymously complain about them. The minority government, being held hostage by the PVV, is refusing to condemn it.

The PVV claims to be for freedom of speech, but is the first to attempt to silence people who criticize them. For example, in response to PVV plans to create isolated ""scumbag villages"" to forcibly house Muslims, immigrants and other ""repeat scumbags"", the left-wing broadcaster VARA published a cartoon aptly likening this plan to WW2 concentration camps. The PVV immediately demanded that it be taken down. In the PVV world, only opinions that agree with the PVV are permitted.

I could go on and on, but life is too short. If you lived here, were eligible to vote here and voted for the PVV, you would either have to be living under a rock to be that misinformed, or you would have to be a masochist who gets off on being oppressed.",0,1333691635,null,0,false,0,c4936ax,t3_ruzhy,t1_c4936ax,t1_c492ong,null,1428666063,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

The PVV does *not* advocate ""freedom from religion"", it only advocates ""freedom from Islam"". It is quick to point out the Judeo-Christian traditions of this country whenver it riles against Muslims. They are only trying to close Muslim schools, not any of the hundreds of Christian schools in this country. Orthodox Jews can ""dress up"" as much as they want, and they do.

Of course it's hardly surprising you're not too fond of freedom *of* religion. Turkey has historically been more like a secular military dictatorship than like a real democracy. You don't seem to understand that freedom *from* religion and freedom *of* religion are one and the same thing; that one cannot exist without the other. Freedom can only exist if everyone is equal before the law. The only way you can have your freedom is by being prepared to respect the freedom of others, including those you don't like.

These are not right-wing movements, these are essentially nationalist socialist movements, but please don't mix this up with Nazism, at least for the sake of conversation.

In my opinion these movements stem out of ignorance or rejection of both globalization and increased complexity of economy. These people are confused and want return to simple times, perhaps to the world of 80s. These movements are catering to this audience with a mixed up bag of policies: more social benefits for the poor; more work by protecting domestic industries and using government to create work; less regulations and more freedom to small entrepreneurs; protecting the way-of-life by closing the country from foreigners; etc...

Also another reason for these movements stemming is increased meritocracy that has deepened income divisions. In good times deepening of income divisions was tolerated as everybody had hope for the future. Since the start of recession, outlook of for future has blackened especially in rural areas and in low-skilled and low-tech industries. In the same time however high-tech and service sectors are still booming, gathering people around the world with pretty decent salaries. It is hard for people to understand that we need more foreign workers especially in IT and high-tech industries while many young people are out of work, and even more harder to accept that we need to settle and assimilate these people in order to succeed.

Like I said before, these are nationalist socialist movements, they aren't right wing, they are mixed bag of old world thinking. I wanted to make this clear as I myself am a conservative, and these people are so out of what is the traditional right that I don't have right words to tell it.

Of course we cannot endorse criminality and muslim extremism!

That is ignoring the Enlightment values. *That* is destroying (Norhtern-)European society.

Furthermore, your whole point of cultural superiority doesn't make any sense to me and doesn't counter my first arguments. Higher criminality is caused by poverty, refusal, unemployement and other sociologic unfavourable factors, not by origins.

The sharia law advocates etc, you will still end up with a very small portion of the population. I never ever see that reaching a majority in this country. Fundamental christians are a bigger problem here then fundamental muslims. There are no muslim political parties because they would have to little voters, while we have 3 christian parties in parliament of which one doesn't even allow women in parliament (until 2 years ago, women couldnt even become a member of their party, they were forced by a judge to accept them) and strives for what they call a democratic theocracy. The other two are less extreme but take pretty backward stances on drugs, abortion, euthanasia and gay rights. Together these parties still make up a large chunk of parliament today. 


The only way religions are still growing in the Netherlands is when parents indoctrinate their kids, and send them to special religious schools. This also goes for muslim childeren. The number of people converting to christianity or islam from being an atheist is incredibly small. Schools the PVV advocates for religious schools for jews and christians but doesn't want for muslims.  

Wilders simply has terrible stances. The Netherlands is so famous for its liberal stances, but how did that came to be? By being liberal we have always been a welcoming nation to anyone. This is a huge benefit for trade and most of our economy depends on trade. 

Wilders is firmly against the EU, wants the Netherlands to step out of the euro. Which are insane stances if you consider that Rotterdam is the 3rd biggest harbor in the world, 40% of our economy consists of exports to Germany, this is why we aren't hit as hard by the euro crisis, Germany is still standing strong so we are pretty safe while our citizens still have massive debt. We're just lucky that the German economy is still standing strong. 

He is firmly pro israel, advocate of the war in iraq and afghanistan, also wants to go to war with Iran. This is no wonder if you look at where he gets his funding. His european parliament fraction refused to honor the dead of the Arab spring and would not rise for a minute of silence for the people who were killed protesting. 
Wilders managed to insult half the EU with his new website while Poland is the fastest growing economy in the EU and will probably be a great partner in trade with Germany and the Netherlands. He is single handedly destroying the liberal reputation the Netherlands used to have and our PM is to chicken to say something about it, because Wilders would destroy the coalition and the PM would lose power.

A lot of these contracts also seem to have been awarded without any bidding taking place at all, which also precludes the existence of an alternate provider making a better offer.

Les frais structurels d'une PME ont beau être faibles en comparaison de ceux des grands groupes, les petites entreprises (qui représentent quand même 63% des emplois) sont plus sensibles aux aléas de l'économie, donc plus fragiles, et doivent pouvoir être flexibles pour résister aux tourmentes et être compétitives.

Augmenter arbitrairement le SMIC, sans assouplir les conditions des contrats de travail, c'est prendre le risque de figer toute possibilité d'emploi dans les secteurs occupés par les PME, sans avoir de champions nationaux capables d'absorber la quantité astronomique de chômeurs qualifiés que ça mettrai à la rue.

Ca retarderai significativement le seul critique dans la vie d'une TPE ou l'activité génère, par le travail du seul exploitant, assez de revenus pour subvenir aux besoins de deux travailleurs, plus une marge de sécurité. C'est ce qui fait que les entrepreneurs travaillent 50 à 90h par semaine et malgré ça peuvent avoir du mal à joindre les deux bouts.

En gros, la seul conséquence d'une telle mesure, ce sera l'augmentation de la part de travailleurs précaires et de chômeurs, qui sont la base électorale de partis comme celui de cet abruti. C'est donc de la pure démagogie, dangereuse et qui ne servirait que ses propres intérêts, en tuant l'économie française et le potentiel d'innovation de nos PME.

true,postmoderno,no-borders,,"sicuramente la situazione cambia da liceo a liceo. E sono sicuro che buona parte dei professori delle superiori in Italia siano cattivi insegnanti. Le strutture scolastiche spesso sono vecchie e obsolete. Detto questo, pero', il sistema italiano presenta delle caratteristiche che lo rendono secondo me molto migliore di quello nordamericano.
Il ""cold calling"" e gli esami orali possono sembrare severi e non necessari, in realta' secondo me aiutano a sviluppare la partecipazione in classe e una preparazione continua. I miei studenti in USA non sono abituati agli esami orali e al cold calling e infatti hanno molti problemi nell'interazione in classe.
Io personalmente odio la severita' in classe e nei voti. I professori che non danno il 10 o che sono molto severi sono sicuramente dei ""douchebags"", ma insegnao una cosa abbastanza importante secondo me, che gli studenti nordamericani non imparano: il voto non conta nulla (o quasi). I miei studenti in USA si arrabbiano se non riescono ad ottenere A o se prendono ""solo"" A-. Il liceo italiano mi ha insegnato che anche se non sono il migliore, o nel top 5% o nel 1st tier, non importa, posso comunque essere un ottimo studente. Io alla maturita' ho preso 83, e' un numero che non vale niente. Oggi insegno in USA. Fossi nato in USA con 83 alla maturita' non sarei neanche entrato in un college, forse.
Gli esami in Italia non sono standardizzati, che e' una cosa IDIOTA del sistema nordamericano. Ti sembra strano forse, ma il sistema nordamericano non ti ""tratta come un umano"", ti tratta come un numero, come una lettera, come uno studente da A o uno studente da B.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Il brutto delle scuole italiane rispetto alle high school americane, secondo me, è che troncano quello che potresti fare come teenager.

È questo l'argomento principale, penso. Che nel liceo italiano ci si affoga qualcuno. Sembra quasi impossibile di poter fare qualcos'altro della sua vita oltre andare a scuola e studiare, sopportare gli insulti dei docenti e prendersi infine un 6 perché ""i voti non contano"", ""sono solo numeri"", idee da professori. Contano i voti. Date 6 a uno studente bravissimo solo perché ""non importano i voti"" e vedrete che dopo un po', qualcuno si stanca di sempre sentirsi al frontiere tra il passare ed il bocciare, mai riconosciuto per i suoi sforzi obbligatori dato il sistemo che chiede un numero insensato di ore di studio per ogni materia. Parlo del liceo linguistico scientifico, non conosco gli altri, mi scuso! 

La classe di cui parlavo prima ha passato 3 mesi a studiare un solo testo di un solo autore francese del cinquecento perché ""è importante"". Essendo francese me stesso, posso confermarvi che mai in vita mia è stato visto quest'uomo. Non sarebbe il brutto latto del troppo pieno di cultura che cercano di insegnare agli studenti italiani? A qualcuno sotto i 18 anni, per il quale il francese è la terza lingua, a cosa serve studiare un testo in vecchio francese del cinquecento che nemmeno le madrilingua hanno visto?

Quando dico che in Canada siamo trattati come umani, dico che non abbiamo 35 ore di scuola alla settimana, che abbiamo pause decenti tra i corsi e che non siamo affogati di compiti, sia al prezzo di saperne un po' meno una volta adulti. Non dico neanche che è il sistema ideale, ma per niente. Semplicemente, andare in classe in Italia mi ha mostrato una cultura del ""saper tutto a ogni prezzo"" che mi fa sentire male per questa generazione di persone che non si possono neanche sviluppare sul lato privato. 

A proposito, in Canada è come negli Stati Uniti, però io sono Quebecchese e c'è una differenza qua: invece di saltare dall'High School all'università, facciamo solo 5 anni in liceo dopo i 6 delle elementari e verso 17-18 anni, andiamo in una scuola di formazione più specifica chiamata il Cégep. Chiunque può allora scegliere un programma che gli conviene e c'è circa una centenaia di possibilità, tra le quale qualcune permettono anche di lavorare dopo 3 anni e un diploma. Funziona un po' come un'università, insomma. 

E non concorderei per dire che gli studenti ""nordamericani"" (perché usare questa parola se non si conosce nemmeno il sistemo canadese?) sono trattati come numeri. Tengono ai voti perché è lo stipendio dello studente, la misura di ciò che vale ""scolasticamente"". I test sono standardizzati per eliminare un problema importante, cioè la subiettività degli insegnanti, e dar loro un contesto comune per prendere decisioni coerenti. 

Poi per finire, il cold calling appare come un modo di constringere gli studenti a studiare ogni materia ogni giorno. Ovviamentee fa in modo che ritengono più informazioni, ma a che prezzo? Sono il primo a dire che in Canada e USA, gli studenti non lavorano abbastanza ma anzi troppo nel sistemo italiano. Organizzare gli esami e dare la data permette invece agli studenti di sviluppare il senso delle responsabilità e di poter avere potere sul loro tempo, tenendone un po' per loro stessi. In Canada e negli USA si impara soprattutto tramite progetti e questo genere di cose. In laboratori di scienza, seguiamo i protocoli, non guardiamo un libro che ci dice come sarebbe di farlo. Facciamo ricerche storiche anzi di sapere tutte le date degli eventi del Trecento. Realizziamo poster informativi su argomenti come il suicidio, facendo finta di organizzare una vera campagna. A scuola sfruttiamo i talenti di chiascuno. È importante sapere, ma saper fare lo è ancora di più.

&gt; Date 6 a uno studente bravissimo solo perché ""non importano i voti"" e vedrete che dopo un po', qualcuno si stanca di sempre sentirsi al frontiere tra il passare ed il bocciare, mai riconosciuto per i suoi sforzi obbligatori dato il sistemo che chiede un numero insensato di ore di studio per ogni materia.

La situazione scolastica è molto varia. È impossibile paragonare – scusate la franchezza – una scuola pugliese a una trentina, e anche all'interno di una stessa città, il clima che si respira in una scuola è diverso da quello che si respira in un altro istituto. Io, per esempio, mi sono impegnato sempre al liceo, ho avuto quasi tutte le serate libere e non mi sono mai trovato in questa situazione. Se ho preso brutti voti, era perché li meritavo. Certo, esistono sicuramente scuole pesanti e professori coglioni, ma non credo sia un problema nazionale.

&gt; Non sarebbe il brutto latto del troppo pieno di cultura che cercano di insegnare agli studenti italiani? A qualcuno sotto i 18 anni, per il quale il francese è la terza lingua, a cosa serve studiare un testo in vecchio francese del cinquecento che nemmeno le madrilingua hanno visto?

I programmi scolastici italiani sono essenzialmente immutati dagli Anni Cinquanta. All'epoca i grandi pensatori preferivano la cultura umanistica a quella scientifica, e ciò ha influito sull'educazione scolastica. In parte concordo con te, ma dall'altro devo notare che aver avuto una buona istruzione letteraria ed artistica ha notevolmente raffinato i miei gusti, e per questo sono grato alla mia scuola. L'ideale sarebbe equilibrare il tutto (meno latino, più scienze!).

Nel caso particolare del testo francese, bisogna valutare le intenzioni del professore. Probabilmente era solo un pretesto per sviluppare certe abilità, come la traduzione letteraria, la lettura in lingua originale, l'analisi del testo. Ad esempio, io ho studiato la Divina Commedia per tre anni, come ogni liceale; ne ricordo pochissimo, ma questo ha cambiato per sempre il modo in cui affronto le poesie. 

Per curiosità, qual era questo testo francese?

&gt; Semplicemente, andare in classe in Italia mi ha mostrato una cultura del ""saper tutto a ogni prezzo"" che mi fa sentire male per questa generazione di persone che non si possono neanche sviluppare sul lato privato.

Non ho mai incontrato un coetaneo che sia sfuggito alla vita sociale per studiare. Sinceramente, questa mi sembra un'esagerazione.

Che poi la scuola sia ancora improntata al nozionismo, su questo posso anche essere d'accordo.

&gt; E non concorderei per dire che gli studenti ""nordamericani"" (perché usare questa parola se non si conosce nemmeno il sistemo canadese?) sono trattati come numeri. Tengono ai voti perché è lo stipendio dello studente, la misura di ciò che vale.

Forse in Canada non c'è il problema della disomogeneità, che è invece il più grave problema della scuola italiana. Mi scuso ancora per la franchezza, ma un 100 alla maturità a Catanzaro non vale un 100 a Belluno: la valutazione non è standardizzata. Per questo a noi può sembrare che uno studente oltreoceano venga trattato ""come un numero"", mentre qui i numeri vanno trattati con prudenza, perché dicono poco e non sono certamente lo stipendio dello studente.

&gt; Poi per finire, il cold calling appare come un modo di constringere gli studenti a studiare ogni materia ogni giorno. Ovviamentee fa in modo che ritengono più informazioni, ma a che prezzo? Sono il primo a dire che in Canada e USA, gli studenti non lavorano abbastanza ma anzi troppo nel sistemo italiano. Organizzare gli esami e dare la data permette invece agli studenti di sviluppare il senso delle responsabilità e di poter avere potere sul loro tempo, tenendone un po' per loro stessi.

Secondo me, questo può andare bene all'università – e infatti così accade – ma il compito della scuola è *guidare* i ragazzi nello studio, così come nella crescita. Chiedere loro di gestire i propri tempi a quattordici anni può essere controproducente (a diciannove anni è già più ragionevole).

Ma soprattutto il cold calling è fatto per diluire nel tempo gli esami orali, che sono impossibili da fare tutti in uno stesso giorno. E credimi, ci sono ancora tanti esami orali nelle università italiane, e quindi è meglio abituarsi il prima possibile.",0,1333739437,null,0,false,0,c499aqf,t3_rwabk,t1_c499aqf,t1_c498o3v,null,1428669030,6,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,6

true,postmoderno,no-borders,,"non conoscevo il sistema canadese ma conosco bene quelli USA e messicani, e quello messicano e' superiore a quello USA, per esempio. So bene come si ""lavora"" nelle High School americane e confermo tutto cio' che ho detto in precedenza. Anche i miei anni di liceo classico sono stati difficili e spesso mi sono chiesto ""perche' devo conoscere Hegel? perche' devo saper tradurre Platone e Cicerone? A cosa serve? Che utilita' ha conoscere la guerra dei 30 anni? Perche' devo leggere l'Orlando Furioso?"". La risposta ce l'ho oggi, anche confrontandomi con gli studenti americani che fuori dalla loro specializzazione, hanno una cultura superficiale e inadeguata. I miei studenti qua in USA non sanno nulla della propria storia e della propria cultura. Meno ancora della storia e delle culture degli altri popoli. Non hanno sviluppato nessun senso critico nei confronti della realta' che li circonda. Non mettono mai in discussione l'autorita' superiore. Non conoscono lingue straniere (le imparano in modo eccellente al college, ma non nella high school) Sono terrorizzati dalla performance scolastica perche' A=successo B=insuccesso. A = Law School B = disoccupazione. 
Per le High Schools sei un numero perche' se una high school ha una performance collettiva bassa, vuol dire che avra' meno soldi. 
I miei studenti scrivono gli essays tutti allo stesso modo, senza creativita' per colpa dei test standardizzati. I miei studenti non conoscono niente della letteratura americana perche' i programmi scolastici delle High schools sono poveri. I miei studenti sono bravi studenti perche' studiano tanto e fanno i compiti, ma non sanno niente della cultura europea quando arrivano al college. Quando in classe faccio riferimenti a Marx o alla cultura classica mi guardano disorientati e confusi. 
Inoltre le high school in USA sono classiste e razziste. Esistono High school buone in quartieri ricchi e quelle del ghetto sono orribili. Potresti pensare che anche in Italia e' cosi'. Anche in Italia esistono licei buoni e licei cattivi dipendendo dalla zona in cui si trovano. Ma il punto e' che i licei buoni sono aperti a tutti perche' sono pubblici. La mia classe del liceo classico era composta da ragazzi ricchissimi e da ragazzi della working class, della campagna e della citta'. Mio fratello ha fatto l'istituto per geometri ed era lo stesso. ricchi e poveri insieme. tutti  a studiare le stesse cose e senza differenze. Onestamente questo non puo' succedere in USA. Le high school delle zone ricche (per esempio quelle delle aree suburbane di DC) sono inaccessibili dai poveri.
E' normale durante gli anni del liceo odiarlo, disprezzarlo, schifarlo, vandalizzarlo, considerarlo una prigione o una tortura insulsa e inutile. Ma non e' cosi'. Con tutti i suoi ENORMI problemi la preparazione UMANA che da' il liceo (soprattutto il classico) italiano e' ottima e spero che lo sia ancora. Se pensi che il liceo non funzioni, non dare la colpa al concetto ideologico su cui e' fondato, ma all'inefficienza delle persone che ci lavorano!

true,Csusmatt,null,null,"I'm in it now, it's my second year. The program is great, but not everybody gets placed in a big city, so you have to face the reality that you might have to live in a pueblo. Often you can commute with a teacher from a bigger city and just work in the pueblo. Some of the regions don't pay on time when you first arrive, so you should definitely bring a reserve of cash with you. I came with $900 the first year and BARELY made it until they paid us around Thanksgiving. This year in Catalunya some people still weren't getting paid around Christmas, but that's an extreme example... I would recommend bringing more money than that, especially if you plan on traveling often, or if you are in a more expensive city. The students are good for the most part. They never stop talking, but that's more of a cultural difference than them being intentionally rude. IMO Spaniards never shut up. Don't worry about your number, TONS of people get accepted as people flake, decide they don't want their assignment, get into grad school, etc. I think everyone gets admitida, I honestly don't think they look at everyone's paperwork that carefully, but I can't really know for sure. 

Whatever you do, accept your placement! Spain is A BLAST, and you wont regret coming even if you get placed in the most remote, boring pueblo because the cities are at most a couple hours bus ride away. 

The one thing that I caution against is coming to Spain with a significant other back in America. 8 months is a long time, and I've seen quite a few people drop out early to go back home and be with their SO. So either break it off before you come or maybe just don't come. I realize if you have a longtime bf/gf you're probably going to ignore that last sentence, but it's pretty selfish to take someone's spot if you leave early. The kids lose out too...

J'irai même jusqu'à dire que la part d'intéressement devrait être obligatoire dans toutes les sociétés, que l'actionnariat salarié y soit systématique ou non. Mais du coup, ça réduit l'intéressement au capital, donc ça augmente le risque de défaut de financement bancaire. Hors la CdC et le capital risque ne sont pas à la hauteur en France.

Un petit détail quand même : ce n'est pas tant la fiscalité qui est ruineuse pour une TPE, c'est la charge de travail qu'exigent les vampires administratifs.

Le temps que demandent le RSI, la CIPAV, l'URSSAF et le FISC en formulaires, déclarations, par courrier uniquement bien entendu, et les montants de cotisations provisionnelles incompressibles sans démarches horriblement lourde est absolument colossal (ça me prenait jusqu'à 20% de mon temps).

Si on veut avoir une économie dynamique, il ne suffit pas d'encourager virtuellement la création d'entreprise, il faut se donner les moyens de permettre aux entreprises d'être rentables. Travailler à la suppression des régimes extra-généraux (CIPAV/RSI) et à l'uniformisation et intégration des formalités et déclarations (typiquement service de compta en ligne) aiderait pas mal.

Assouplir le code du travail pour flexibiliser le marché du travail réduirait aussi le risque de défaillance d'entreprises.

Enfin, le système d'assurance chômage est très problématique en l'état : alléger significativement les cotisations sur des CDI serait à la fois incitateur à la pérennisation des embauches et un facteur pour la consolidation des emplois en TPE et PME...

Une fois tout ça en place on pourra parler de remonter le SMIC. Mettre la charrue avant les boeufs, ça va juste servir à intensifier l'inflation et faire exploser le nombre de défaillance d'entreprises.

There are some more but these are some of my favorites by far. They usually end up about 10 or so euros for a meal which is extremely affordable for how good they are.

Are you from barcelona? I would say there are truly great restaurants where you can eat lunch for 8-12 euros. Full course. Off course you'll not find those restaurants near the Rambla de les Flors, or the Barri Gotic, or the ""placa del reloj"" (wherever that is)

Baltazhar is great

La Semproniana is very good

Pa i Trago has traditional catalan food and it s excellent

Mediterranea

Not super expensive michelline star grade restaurants by any means

There are dozens more, restaurants with ""peix de llotja"" (fresh fishmarket goods), restaurants with ""mar i muntanya"" (mix of meats and fish), vegan restaurants with organic only courses. 

Actually the food is one of the main attractions of Barcelona... to say the food there is junk is like to say that Broadway has no musical scene, or that Paris museums are all a shit, or that you should not go to London to watch a play, because they are not that interesting and it can't compare with serbian or turkish theater. 

I don't know if you are just trolling, and off course everyone is entlitled their own opinion, but if you say the catalan food is not good and the you reccommend him some philadelphia roll and fried chicken in Barcelona...why don't you reccommend him your favourite mc donalds or kebab/shawarma?

Purtroppo la qualità degli insegnanti era molto variabile. A fianco di insegnanti eccellenti c'erano anche insegnanti pessimi, e in materie molto importanti (italiano, storia, etc.). Il preside in particolare era un individuo inqualificabile a cui interessava solo far vedere che era il preside e mettere gli insegnanti buoni nella classe di sua figlia, con buona pace di tutto il resto. Gli insegnanti che provavano a prendere iniziative interessanti (partecipazione a gare di matematica, latino, etc.) venivano spesso sabotati, e le risorse poi finivano per farsi la palestrina privata.

The idea is that these game developers have to find new outlets and make it easier to buy their games and run them. Steam is wildly successful, for example.

95% of our revenue came from carrier app stores, 5% from our own slightly enduser-enabled b2b. That about tells you how many people were searching for games anywhere else but on their carrier's appstore.

...going for both long-tail (less chance of someone releasing a pirated version for small stuff) and aggressive pricing on AA and higher titles was another factor in the equation: Revenue is price times amount, and lowering the price can drastically increase the amount.

How about having a limit on  how much money a country can borrow from the ECB? A sensible limit that doesn't jeopardize neither the economy of the country nor the other countries in the Euro.

If a country doesn't reach this limit, no questions are asked. However, if a country exceeds the limit, the budget needs the approval and sanction of whatever mechanism is implemented by the countries in the Euro zone. And it could be denied or interests raised.

true,Superjuden,null,null,"&gt;But what do you think the reason is that the gaming industry is so big?

Loads of reason. I would even wager that since piracy has gotten easier, more people have gotten into gaming. Pirates can consume a lot of content and grow very particular tastes, they can take the risk of trying a new title because the risk is only that they won't like the game rather than they not liking the game and being out 20-60 dollars. Steam has seen the sale of games explode when they've put them on sale, simply because the risk becomes lower. Plenty of times people just buy games and never play them because 5 bucks for a game was too good an offer. 

Back when consoles used cartridges  the problem was that professional pirates sold pirated games rather than consumers pirating the games on their own. All you need now is an internet connection, a DVD-burner and a store that can jailbreak your console of which there are plenty. I've even seen adverts in newspapers where stores have marketed the fact that they can do this(usually they never flat out tell people that this allows you to play pirated games but the mods they offer usually do this). Of course, this all rather anecdotal and speculative. 

There are probably far more important aspects which have caused gaming to explode as it has. The fact that many kids who grew up in the '80s and '90s with the NES, SNES and N64 have now become young adults or plain adults with far greater income probably account for a large part of the growth. These people can afford to buy all of the major current-gen consoles and buy games for them.

Then you have the fact that graphics improve very much between each console generation, at least in the AAA-titles, this may make people far more willing to buy a new console because even if graphics do not make for a better game they usually do make for better adverts and people are suckers for a good advert. Back when games like FFVII were marketed, most of the footage was pre-rendered cutscenes and battles rather than what made up most of the game which was low-resolution 2D backgrounds with low-resolution character models walking around.

While these are not definitative figures, they should give you an indication of the piracy situation.

Basically, most studies point to the fact that around 10-20% are pirates, depending on the industry, and those pirates tend to consume far more content than the average consumer resulting in bloated ""loss figures"" since ""loss figures"" almost entirely assume that each pirated copy is the same as a loss in sales. At least in North America.

Places where the price of games vs. average income is higher, like Africa, South America, Asia, Russia, usually have a much higher piracy rate, leading me to conclude most pirates are simply people who can't afford the products rather than people who simply refuse to pay for the products, at least when looked at from a larger perspective. There are always some people who just pirate games no matter what but these people seem to be a minority of pirates. In NA I'd wager that most game pirates are primarily those with low incomes, like kids and young adults. Those who simply can't afford to buy as many games as they'd like to and make up for it by pirating the games they can't afford. The losses from piracy by these groups are probably far less than is claimed by most copyright holders, if not completely eclipsed by the benefits it produces in the long run. I mean a teen might pirate 10 games a month but once that teen gets a job you're probably dealing with a person who knows far more about each the developers and their products than the average consumer, resulting in long term brand loyalty or awareness.",0,1333834694,null,0,true,0,c49m6sn,t3_rxnms,t1_c49m6sn,t1_c49ljwp,null,1435723408,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

The problem is that Eurozone has various amount of different countries with different industries with different social policies with different demographics, etc... that must be taken into account. For example...

* Italy has birthrate of 1.38 child per women, while in Ireland its 1.96, meaning in Italy there will be less workers producing wealth in the future while having more pensioners consuming it, in Ireland the situation is different. Shouldn't this be factored too in to calculations?
* Germany has a wide variety of different key industries, small countries such as Finland have fewer key industries and these industries are much more reliant of the success of few key corporations, for example due to Nokia having difficulties on competing on smart phone market, there has been a sizeable plummet in Finnish exports and tax revenue. If Nokia would be a German company, the German state would have hardly noticed the change. Should this be calculated too, how dependent countries are of list of corporations, and in how volatile markets they operate?

These are just few of the bigger examples what kind of things must be taken notice and factored into the analysis of what is sensible and what is not. Even if we would take even more measures to our analysis tool, it still would lack information, it still would be too rigid. The only way to determine how much money and with what rates can be loaned for a country in a certain time is via markets.

But let say we make this tool, we still have the problem that in some situation the tool will just say No: no more money. Maybe because the state went over the line, maybe because it didn't follow up its restructuring program, maybe something else. In the end there is no more money. What people have to accept is that states can and will go bankrupt; state official don't have job security, they can be fired at will; citizens don't have unlimited benefits, they will end when money ends. In my honest opinion, this is the things that people have to accept, that money can run out and that they have to take responsibility of it. What ever mechanism we have, people aren't free from the consequences of their actions.

The market will ultimately decide the price. If the developer can't see that, then he/she deserves to be out of business, 

&gt;If the price is too high, then don't buy his product. That's how capitalism works. 

Yes, but the issue here isn't really about capitalism. Digital services are quite different from a physical product. In a sense, they are infinite. So the approach to selling these products/services has to change. Many companies have actually found ways of doing this, converting games to f2p, selling them on software platforms, sales, dlc etc.. This is the climate in which developers have to compete. There is no doubt about that at all. The game developer that sets too high a price, or decides to sell it on some obscure platform doesn't exist in a commercial sense. They are easily ignored, because they are obsolete.

I'm not really sure why credit cards are not more common but I do know that you have to pay money if you want to charge someone's credit card so that's probably the reason why many don't “allow” it. I think things don't change simply because no one feels like it's necessary. You can use your EC card everywhere and that's what people do. I personally only pay cash. And then there's also an argument to be made about privacy - something that's really important to many people around here.

Those are all countries that have a much lower life expectancy and have more natural resources, which is kind of the point.      

You can turn it any way you want, but a flat tax would not be sustainable in our economy, unless we make huge sacrifices in other parts of our society. Whether it be education, protection, social welfare, healthcare, etc. The reason why we are considered the happiest people on earth is exactly because of those things. They are the result of our culture, a pragmatic culture in which health, intelligence and happiness are considered to be good things. A culture of enlightenment. This is the exact same culture Wilders is claiming to want to 'protect'. Which is partly why it's so very ironic, and hypocritical.        

&gt; everyone benefits equally from the state. So everyone should fund it by the same percent of their income.      

Well, no. Those who are rich, are rich because they had the intelligence and opportunity to do so, both of which are the result of good healthcare/education and many potential healthy and intelligent employees and consumers. It goes both ways. The state merely provides a short-cut at achieving these things. It makes sense that the people that have gotten rich because of these things, contribute more to sustain these very same principles.           

A completely 'fair' (Libertarian) society is not the most happy society, it will just be the most efficient.
