The Affordable Care Act was a major victory for fixing the US health care system, and from what I've read, Obama's bailout of the US auto industry has revived that sector of our economy, which might otherwise have been lost.  He also restored federal funding for stem cell research and has apparently been trying to avoid war with Iran.  

You also need to take Republican obstructionism into account when assigning blame for specific American problems not being fixed.  

Obama openly ran as a centrist, even though many people falsely believed him to be leftist, and he promised to do things like escalate the war in Afghanistan while he was campaigning, so many people who were let down were people who had unrealistic expectations.

true,thecemind,null,null,"I see that many here are commenting on and discussing how barbaric circumcision is, and denouncing the religious views behind circumcision, while they are ignoring the scientific and health basis behind the procedure. 

Circumcision GREATLY prevents HPV, urinary tract infections, and STDs. It also cuts down on penile cancer risk. Uncircumcised men are 8.2 times as likely to contract HIV. 

The important thing to also keep in mind is that when done as an infant, the pain is less and the child won't remember it as painful or traumatic later on. How many uncircumcised 18 year olds do you think will enthusiastically want to be circumcised? It's not a simple procedure after infancy, and requires surgery and post-operative care. I don't think many men will object to having been circumcised as infants to spare them of the pain and discomfort they would have to suffer as adults. Also, the benefits are dramatic and there are virtually no cons.

It is fairly reasonable to state that, with all the data and evidence to back it, male circumcision should be done immediately after a child is born in the hospital.

true,smacksaw,CANA,Canada,"No, I do understand...I don't suggest this lightly. Maybe a casino is a better analogy. I'm suggesting we stop gambling. What you're alluding to with the lost assets is akin to ""well, let's just stop playing Keno and roulette and stick to stuff with better odds like blackjack and poker."" Until we actually get out of that, we're going to be propping up a habit. How much money do we spend/waste/lose to inflation to keep the system you describe afloat? Banking and investing has become...so incredibly complicated. 

Now, when it comes to rebuilding it, I would argue that with a simpler system, people would rush to participate. And if you guide it responsibly, it will work. How did China or Russia get rich from nothing so quickly? How did Iceland recover so quickly? Chile taking control of it's own sovereignty? There are good (and bad) examples everywhere.

I argue that if we got rid of fraudulent accounting, all of the ""lost savings"" you're talking about would be irrelevant. The issue is that saving your money is currently just plain stupid to do. Inflation erases your savings. Thus, you must invest to keep up with inflation and keep that money indexed to it. If all of this fake, inflated money disappeared, deflation happens and the small amount of money people have is worth more. If we don't let it be articially inflated due to casino market investing, it will make sense to save and be paid interest.

Furthermore, with the money we save by not suffering inflation, I argue that we could repay peoples' pensions and lost money and still give them the same standard of living.

Now you may not like this idea, but I'm more of a free/freer market-type of person, so to a point, I would prefer to let the market decide. Just a brief history thing that informs my decision here: I'm a fan of Thomas Jefferson. The ""father"" of libertarianism as he is, he was also strongly against bankers and speculators. He wasn't an anarchist. I believe there is a balance of minimal rights and liberties that can be given to all parties and we just work it out for ourselves naturally.

Or we could create an extremely complex system of regulations, but I'm not sure that really works because people find a way to exploit the rules, like credit swaps/derivatives. The phrase ""rules are made to be broken"" was never more true. 

I get shat upon by other libertarians for suggesting regulation, but my philosophy is to err on the side peeling away rules like layers to an onion. Only as much regulation as we need and it is always on our mind to think about how we can keep it from growing, while having enough to protect the rights and freedoms of everyone. Regulation isn't evil, but we can't have that conversation when one side thinks it is and the other can't get enough of it (to their own detriment).",0,1341636484,null,0,false,0,c5ajb6q,t3_w4hz5,t1_c5ajb6q,t1_c5a8y9t,null,1429315823,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,wlp5,null,null,"Haha, yes, I've seen flat irons on fire from US women before.

First, the theory, US power is at 110 Volts while most of Europe (Spain included) is at 220/230 Volts. As you noted, the frequency is also different, US is at 50Hz while Europe at 60Hz. Also, the plugs are differently shaped.

Now, the practical. Most chargers (laptops, cellphones) should have no problem working anywhere. Just check the small writing on them, you should see the power input numbers where 230V 60Hz should also be written. For these, you just need some cheap adapters to take care of the different plug shape. You can find these at radioshack for $5, airports for $10 or be smart and get them off the internet for $1 or chinese stores in barcelona for 1 euro. These are small plastic adapters.

Anything more powerful will probably not work directly, most of the appliances you mentioned will not work directly except some ""travel"" ones. Check the writings on the device or cable , if you see the 230V 60Hz , you just need a cheap adapter like before. If not, you have the following options.

1. Buy new ones in the US that will work here. These are typically labelled as ""Travel"" ones but not sure you'll find quality ones.

2. Buy a couple of transformers. Those are bigger block-shaped things that will change the power. You can find these at radioshack and will cost from $20 to $100. You need to be careful though , you need to know how powerful of a transformer you need. Check your devices for their power requirement , it should use the Watts measurement unit, maybe you'll see something like 100W . You need to get a transformer that can support more watts than the device you're using, otherwise the transformer will catch fire. Unfortunately blow-dryers are pretty power hungry so you'll probably need powerful transformers, which will be expensive. Also, these things can be heavy which might be an issue these days with the stupid airline limits. To answer a comment of yours, yes the transformer will also take care of the frequency, just check it to make sure, it should say it outputs 60Hz.

3. Buy new appliances in Barcelona. Find the ""El Corte Inglais"" near you, it's the equivalent of Macy's over here and they will have many to choose from. Not the cheapest place but probably the easiest for you. Before you buy anything, go to their support desk with your passport and get the 10% foreigners' discount, not sure if it applies to these but worth to check. Also, look into the procedure for getting the tax back (it's close to 20% of the price here). You'll need to file some paperwork at the airport when you're leaving but worth your time if you bought lots of stuff (you'll need to show the items at the airport so they make sure you're bringing these back with you).

I like the idea of the Spanish National Anthem in that there aren't any words so you end up with a rousing tune rather than some expression of ideology with which you might disagree. I'm thinking specifically of the UK's National Anthem whose first line is ""God save our gracious Queen."" Personally I think the anthem is a mournful dirge anyway and expressing support for a monarchy which I believe should have been abolished years ago does not endear it to me in any way.

I'd like to replace it with Sousa's Liberty Bell march as that would fit the criteria of being an easily recognised, stirring piece of music with no contentious lyrics. Unfortunately it was written by an American, named after an icon of independence from the UK and was used as the theme for Monty Python's Flying Circus so would probably not be eligible for consideration.

Apart from the Spanish anthem, I also find the French and Italian National Anthems rather stirring but nothing beats the former National Anthem of the USSR.

true,jorge_mad,null,null,"First of all i would like to make clear the concept of tapas, because frequently foreign people have the wrong idea, and even some spaniards.

What we call a ""tapa"" is any sort of food that is given out for free when you order a drink. You don't pay for the tapas, and if you order further rounds of beers more tapas (usually different) come your way. Normally you can not choose the tapa, although in some places you have a list of free tapas to choose from with each beer.

If you order and pay for the food, that is what we call a ""raci√≥n"". Normally a bigger amount compared to the tapa in the same place. If you want to order raciones, first order the drinks, then wait for the tapas, and then ask for the ""men√∫ de raciones"" and order them. Otherwise they might just skip the tapa.

Since you asked for tapas bars (the free ones), here go some typical ones:

Los amigos: a lot of food with each round, medium quality https://plus.google.com/103263619801059119345/about

Museo del Jam√≥n: very cheap beer, and nice tapas (jam√≥n, chorizo). The place is very tourist oriented, with ham legs hanging everywhere. https://plus.google.com/116550208739192587339/about

El Tigre: big amounts, so-so quality, but a fun place to meet people, popular among students. Always crowded! https://plus.google.com/111903141221565069515/about

Since you will be here for one night, i would suggest the Museo del Jam√≥n in Sol for warming up with a couple of beers (+tapa) then walk around to find some nice looking terrace for a proper dinner. Up Espoz y Mina street there are some small streets with tons of them.

Have a nice time!

This is not 100% correct: The ""Bundestag"" normally has about 600 seats (+ those coming from ""√úberhangmandate"" which we will not consider because we want to keep things simple). You have to get at least 5% of votes to get any seats *at all*. This means, 5% will get you about 30 seats.

In fact you will get a little bit more, as the votes which don't make the 5% threshold are discarded. In a (hypothetical) example where 50 small parties get about 1% each another slightly bigger party (with 5% of the vote) would get 60 seats (as they make up for 10% of the votes considered after throwing out the small parties).

This system sometimes is considered unjust, as it means that emerging parties will not be considered by cautious voters, because this would mean that their vote is lost (much like in a 2 party system like the USA). On the other hand it is said that the instability and changing alliances which comes with of a lot of small parties was one of the reasons of the failure of the Weimar republic.

If a party has more votes for direct candidates than for the party itself, they get as much seats in the parliaments as they have direct votes. This is called '√úberhangmandate'. A sensitive topic, because there are parties who profit from that. To get into the Bundestag, a party has to have at least a 5% share of the vote or three direct candidates. I don't know about the L√§nder parliaments and the direct candidates, but the 5% minimum is universal for Bund and L√§nder.

The Bundespr√§sident is elected in the Bundesversammlung, which consists of the whole Bundestag and the same number of delegates from the Bundesl√§nder, who elect these delegates. The Bundespr√§sident doesn't have much power, but he is necessary to sign every law after he makes sure it is constitutional. There were only very few instances where a president didn't sign a law because it was not constitutional. If the law is constitutional, the president has to sign it.

The Bundestag elects a Bundeskanzler from its members. This Bundeskanzler chooses his/her ministers (who don't have to be members of the parliament) and forms the government. There is a rule that there should be no gap in succession of chancellors, so if a chancellor loses the confidence of the parliament, they can only impeach the chancellor by electing a new chancellor.

That was the case when Helmut Kohl became chancellor. There were three parties in the parliament at the time and the FDP was a small but necessary party who was needed to get a majority for chancellor votes, so they were sought after for coalitions. Helmut Schmidts (SPD) government lost the confidence of the FDP and some MPs turned to the Kohls CDU and got them the majority for a no-confodence-vote, in which Helmut Kohl was elected chancellor.

- Dedicate a sunday morning to get lost in the retire (DO NOT GO AT NIGHT), it has a small zoo, a museum, a convention center, a lake and the only known statute dedicated to the devil (monumento al angel caido)

- Explore the whole Chueca/Funcreal area, lots of small restorants and bars aswell as exotic shops, also the san anton market and my favorite ice cream place straight on the plaza de chueca. remember that chueca is the gay district of madrid so it can get weird for some people after dark. 

- The worst of sol is whats at face value, the plaza is nice and callao is a good commercial area, but all the good spots are hidden behind in huertas, or walking towards la latina, when around in sol you can go to plaza mayor which is the tipical thing, but i suggest you go a bit futher in that direction and go to the san miguel market which is a beautiful renovated food market. from there go down to arenal street and walk to the opera building or continue down there and get to palacio de oriente which is a beautiful palace which has the campo del moro park next to it. 

- in the other direction going up gran via you reach plaza de espa√±a which is very nice, crossing the plaza as around for templo de bod, which is a beautiful egyptian temple which was brought piece by piece from egypt, you can go in by day but the lighting by night is beautiful so its worth visitng both day and night, just take in to account its also a bottelon area, bottelon (big bottle) is a spanish tradition where before going out to bars and clubs you just sit on the grass or in a park with your friends, each brings some booze and you get a bit tipsy for cheap before going to bars and clubs where alcohol is much more expencive, so at night templo de bod might get a bit crowded. 

The nice part is that if you go to the back of the park where the temple is you can see the whole casa de campo park.

- La Latina is a mixed bag, you can find old dirty taxi driver bars next to modern cuisine restorants next to pincho/tapa places next to clubs. its worth exploring by night and going with the flow.

true,BombTheFuckers,null,null,"&gt;Circumcision GREATLY prevents HPV, urinary tract infections, and STDs

STDs / HIV are non-issues for toddlers. And any adult with a brain uses a condom. UTI are so rare, circumcision has no benefit at all in this case. The disadvantages are **way** worse than the benefits, if there even are any.

&gt;The important thing to also keep in mind is that when done as an infant, the pain is less and the child won't remember it as painful or traumatic later on.

Babies feel just as much pain as adults do. There are studies out there that suggest that babies actually feel more pain than we do.
Also you can't give them any pain medication, they are too young for that.

&gt;How many uncircumcised 18 year olds do you think will enthusiastically want to be circumcised? It's not a simple procedure after infancy, and requires surgery and post-operative care. 

None. That's the entire fucking point! But it is still a safe procedure for adults. Adults get circumcised for medical reasons all the time. And they get pain medications, which the toddler doesn't get.

&gt;and requires surgery and post-operative care.

Right. So? if an adult wants to get circumcised, he still has the option. After 3 weeks, 95% of the pain and irritations are gone.
And he will experience a **lot** less pain.

&gt;Also, the benefits are dramatic and there are virtually no cons.

Since there are no medical benefits of circumcising a toddler whatsoever , the entire idea of doing it is fucking unacceptable.

&gt;It is fairly reasonable to state that, with all the data and evidence to back it, male circumcision should be done immediately after a child is born in the hospital.

&gt; Say the state can't make its debt payments, and no one will lend it any more money. In that case, the federal government can step in and put the state into receivership. This would involve the assignment of an accountant to manage the state's debt, overseen by a judge. It would be a lot like bankruptcy, except instead of following a structured set of steps‚Äîinforming creditors, appointing creditors' committees, a 120-day window to file a plan, etc.‚Äîa receiver has the authority to force creditors to renegotiate loans in a speedy fashion. However, the accountant in charge would not have the power to make decisions about the state's budget, such as which programs needed to be cut and which taxes had to be raised. (No state has ever gone into receivership.)

And this is besides the idea of Pork divided by US congressmen and senators for their home states and constituencies. Will Norway or Sweden agree to such a system.

What I find interesting is the fact that *all* mentioned parties had shifts in their agenda.

Same can be said about the FDP: They used to be libertarian in a general sense which some time narrowed down to a focus on the free market. You can imagine how German voters think about that party after/during a financial crisis which was caused by big time deregulation. Combine this with the lack of qualified personnel in the FDP and you have a party which may not even get 5% in the next election (survey show currently about 5% support).

The startup scene in Berlin is more international (think Silicon Valley) and the Munich one more conservative (think traditional city structures). Look for 'munich startups', there are some groups on facebook and other platforms. 

Depending on where you come from experience wise, there is traditinal IT and Dev and startup lala land. Very different. ;) If you are good and you can work remote, you might be able to get around as a freelancer. 

German should not be a problem - it is good starting to learn it, but in cities like Munich or Berlin you can get around without problem.

Subscribe to http://startupdigest.com/munich/ for a weekly email and take that as a starting point to getting in touch with others. Many of these groups have connections to / link to other areas of expertise.

Get yourself a simple Xing account. Germans only sometimes use Linkedin but are way more embedded in http://xing.com - there are lokal groups as well. Check for M√ºnchen and Munich. Fill it out in english with all you can do and link it to your munich address. Chances are that you actually might be approached by headhunters. 

Make a simple website where people can link to and say ""my friend is looking for"".

Cost of living in Munich are between the highest in Germany. You need to research that carefully. 

&gt; this depends on cost of living and what I could be making 

if they hired you for a job, they did not calculate for you going some place else expensive to live. ;) DSL can be tricky on the country side, but usually in and around munich you should not have a problem getting decent internet connection for working remote.

Fachhochschule is considered to be a bit 'lower' and you have to call yourself ""name of degree (FH). It depends very much also on which Uni / FH you are choosing.

I actually have a funny thing going on -my 20 year old degree has to be (BA) because my state wanted to mark me as ""belonging to the third sector of education but no real FH or UNI!"" and now I have to explain all the time that I do not have a bachelor.

""Getting into a Fachhochschule is way easier than getting into a University (and Fachohchschulen in general are easier).""

This is a typical attitude but in all honesty, except for certain special cases for business studies you should be concentrating on all the other areas of the school: what is the surrounding, how fast can I go through, what support system is in place, how fast can I get into this, how will what I can study here benefit me, how is the school helping me making advances in career afterwards, how is the alumni situation and so on.

true,executivemonkey,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I accept your point about Merkel, but the French are no angels when it comes to foreign policy.  Their elite commandos are notorious for covert actions and assassinations in Africa; to their credit, the French have also intervened in Africa for humanitarian reasons.  The French are now eagerly adopting drone technology - in fact, my country just completed some kind of deal in which we are giving France a lot of our drone tech, and France and the UK recently (February, I believe) embarked on a joint venture to design the next generation of combat drones.

So expect to see the French and the British increasing their use of drone technology in the ensuing years.  Germany might well have a cultural aversion to such actions; I wouldn't be surprised.  However, if Europe is someday going to defend itself without relying on America, Germany will have to rearm, and it looks like the battlefields of the future will require drone technology.  So, Germans won't be able to remain pure on this issue forever.

From Poland - north to the awesome Baltic countries. All three are lots of fun and, as already mentioned, Estonia in late July is a pretty great place to be.

&gt; &gt;  Oda_Krell: [""the result of the summit is not bad: it gives the ECB the chance to enter the game and lower pressure on Italy and Spain""](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/vsmhl/economist_europes_leaders_for_once_exceeded/c57oqip)

&gt; I take issue with the ""exceeding expectations"" part, and pointed out that it's just a patch, buying time. The problem is that we don't know how much time they've bought. Of course, I'm not naive to believe that our dear or not-so-dear leaders would strike a decisive blow, and change the course of the planet. But this plan is not enough even for starters, and it's unsure when we'll see the ball rolling. Despite what is happening with Spanish banks, I still believe that Italy is in more trouble. Merkel's remarks at home worried me, she laid preconditions that could leave Italy outside.

&gt; Edit: let's add some numbers to the mix.

true,DisregardMyPants,UNSA,United States,"Holy shit, this is quite possibly the worst description of the American political environment I've ever read. To any Europeans reading this: This is the ""fanboy"" version of the Democratic party.

&gt;The Affordable Care Act was a major victory for fixing the US health care system

It also has made our current system utterly unmovable(you'll never move to single payer now), required him giving up Medicare's ability to negotiate drug prices for even longer(so we will get ripped off), and it has a pretty low approval rating in general.

Obama completely failed to advocate for his bill, and as a result it is disliked by most Americans.

&gt;Obama's bailout of the US auto industry has revived that sector of our economy, which might otherwise have been lost

Yes, this is one thing he did that worked.

&gt; He also restored federal funding for stem cell research and has apparently been trying to avoid war with Iran.

Yes, because he's tossed us into other wars, and is now bombing more countries than we were during the Bush years. We don't have the money to do a war with Iran, but he's been perfectly happy to blow up people in other countries less capable of defending themselves.

&gt;You also need to take Republican obstructionism into account when assigning blame for specific American problems not being fixed.

The Republicans blocked the bills because they thought they were *bad bills*. Part of being a good President is being able to create bills that garner support on both sides.

&gt;Obama openly ran as a centrist, even though many people falsely believed him to be leftist, and he promised to do things like escalate the war in Afghanistan while he was campaigning, so many people who were let down were people who had unrealistic expectations.

People aren't upset about Afghanistan. There are plenty of things more ""to the left"" that he promised and lied about.

 People object to the drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan. They also object to him breaking his promises for more transparency(which he failed at), no lobbyists in his administration(he has a huge number of them, including in key positions heading up his institutions), he began raiding Medical Marijuana dispensaries after promising to back off, he re-signed the Patriot Act with very little in the way of reform, and he has completely failed to roll back the surveillance state after initially insisting that there was no need to compromise our rights for security.

The Democrats are cowards.  They're afraid to be called weak on defense. They were too pathetic to send the NDAA back with an indefinite detention provision because of what the Republicans would say about them.

The Republicans don't even *actually* filibuster anymore. They just have to suggest it's a possibility and the Democrats fold like construction paper in water.

Posts like yours are what many Europeans want to hear so I suspect it will be well received - but it's not how things are unless you are an absolute devotee of the Democratic party.

It's the false narrative that gets to me: All these *unreasonable* people expected Obama to do what he said(while falsely implying they're upset about things he didn't), then all the *unreasonable* Republicans made it impossible to function(during a Democratic supermajority), then list a few small token issues that are tiny in comparison to the missteps.

true,DingoAteYourBabeh,null,null,"French business urgently requires shock treatment to cut labour costs and boost its flagging ability to compete on international markets, top economists and business leaders have warned Fran√ßois Hollande. 
Growing pressure on the socialist president to take action mounted when the country‚Äôs leading group of economists issued an unprecedented collective appeal for a ‚Äúmassive transfer‚Äù of France‚Äôs high social charges on employers on to direct taxes. 

The ‚ÄúEconomists‚Äô Circle‚Äù, a non-partisan group whose members include those working in institutions such as the European Central Bank as well as advising the government itself, said France required a ‚Äúsupply shock‚Äù. 

Its appeal came on the eve of a conference summoned by the president at which ministers, officials, trade unions, business leaders and others will discuss a range of economic and social issues, including labour costs, employment terms and pensions.
 
The call for action was reinforced at the circle‚Äôs annual conference at the weekend by Louis Gallois, former head of EADS, the aerospace group.

‚ÄúThere is a massive problem of confidence among the heads of our companies,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI believe we must have a ‚Äòcompetitiveness shock‚Äô to help the exposed sectors.‚Äù 

Laurence Parisot, head of Medef, the employers‚Äô federation, added her voice in an interview with the newspaper Journal du Dimanche. ‚Äú[We] must address the alarming and continual erosion of the competitiveness of France over the past 12 years,‚Äù she said. 

French business leaders have strongly criticised moves by Mr Hollande‚Äôs government to raise taxes on big companies and the wealthy, including a 75 per cent marginal rate on incomes above ‚Ç¨1m. Last week, it unveiled ‚Ç¨7.2bn in extra taxes for this year alone, the majority levied by a rise in wealth taxes and surcharges on banks and energy companies. 

But business and economists are also deeply concerned by France‚Äôs loss of international market share, which led to a record ‚Ç¨70bn trade deficit last year, and declining profit margins. 

They point the finger in large part at France‚Äôs high labour costs, caused by the financing of big social welfare programmes through charges on employers and employees. 

Joining the call, Henri Proglio, head of EDF, the state-controlled electricity company, told the conference hourly wage costs averaged ‚Ç¨34 in France, compared with ‚Ç¨30 in Germany and ‚Ç¨20 in Spain and the UK. 

‚ÄúThe immediate difficulty is above all the weak profitability of the great majority of businesses which inhibits their capacity to innovate, to export, to invest and to create jobs,‚Äù the Economists‚Äô Circle said. ‚Äú[We must] improve this profitability by a massive transfer of social charges on to [tax].‚Äù 

Mr Gallois said ‚Ç¨30bn-‚Ç¨50bn in social charges should be shifted on to value added tax, other direct taxes, or taxes on pensions. 

The government has so far resisted these calls, instead stressing the priority of tackling France‚Äôs high debt. It says fostering investment, innovation, research and support for small companies is the main way to tackle competitiveness. It has already reversed a move by the previous government to shift some social charges on to VAT. 

But with the Economists‚Äô Circle and figures like Mr Gallois ‚Äì a known government sympathiser who has been appointed to the role of commissioner for investment ‚Äì joining the calls, it has begun to signal it may shift its ground. 

Pierre Moscovici, finance minister, told the weekend conference tackling labour costs by reducing social charges was ‚Äúnot a taboo‚Äù and suggested that if a consensus was reached in the social partners‚Äô discussions, some action might be taken. Senior government officials said Mr Hollande was well aware of the concerns about the issue, but warned that any move to change would take time.

Obama gets derided by people like you because they can't stand a successful Democratic president. 

I also like how you say I'm totally wrong, then most of your responses begin with ""Yes, but.""  I'm not wrong, you're just determined to find fault with the President by nit-picking and refusing to give him credit for anything.

For example, rather than giving him praise for accomplishing health care reform, including a prohibition of the practice of not covering pre-existing conditions and measures that will make health care affordable for all Americans, something which various administrations have tried to do for decades yet failed, you complain because it isn't perfect.  We live in a system where any major bill will have to be a compromise - don't act like you don't understand that.  You complain that it will be difficult to get to a single payer system, as though single payer was politically feasible.  You allege that Obama's reform has caused difficulties regarding Medicare drug price negotiations - that prohibition predates the ACA and an extension of it is trivial compared to the benefits of removing the bans on pre-existing condition coverage.

You gripe about the last NDAA, without realizing that Obama's enforcement guidelines, issued in March, completely neutered the provisions mandating military detention.  It was the closest Obama could get to a line-item veto, and the only way to fix the flaw that the Republicans insisted on inserting into a military funding bill.  But did you blame the Republicans for putting the objectionable provisions in the bill in the first place?  No, because you are determined to find fault and refuse to give credit.

Your praise for Republicans objecting to ""bad bills"" is laughable - the GOP is unfit to govern.  The Bush years and the Tea Party idiocy prove it.  If you're advocating for the current GOP, you have no grounds for criticizing anyone else's interpretation of politics.

The reason is that illegal aliens will not go to the police to report crimes, nor cooperate with police, if they think the police will detain and deport them.  This will result in large communities where the people simply won't have anything to do with the police out of fear of deportation, which will make them easy victims for criminals and reluctant to report crimes, turn in evidence, or serve as witnesses.

In Texas, the local police in Houston and Austin lobbied with great passion against being tasked with enforcing immigration law, for the reason I gave.  They were very public with their opposition, because they wanted the local communities of illegals to know that they could still report crimes or serve as witnesses to crimes without fear of deportation.  The Texas police are not in favor of illegal immigration, they just don't want to make illegals even more reluctant to talk to the police.

No, it is quite cheap.

For education yes; yet PhD. is not seen as the best diploma - said to be less good than a degree from an engineering school - so it might be more difficult to find a job there.

It seems pretty normal to me to assume that anybody, whether Arab or not, should ridicule, for example, the extent of male guardians' rights over women in Saudi Arabia, or the fact that people there are executed for ""sorcery"". The way I see it, with regards to such matters, it's not particularly relevant what the history behinds such practices are. They are patently ridiculous, and can hardly be said to have generally positive effects.

As to the question of *how* to solve the problem, obviously you will then need to have a deeper understanding of the culture and the source of the problem to go about solving it, which means the people of the country themselves will have to solve it.

Similarly, with regards to racism in Ukraine, which seems to be the main point of discussion here, I'm not sure how anybody can defend this as a positive thing. There is racism everywhere, and it's condemnable anywhere. As to whether the extent of racism in Ukraine is as great as has been reported in certain sources, I suspect it has been exaggerated, and in any case I defer to Ukrainians, or people who have visited Ukraine, to report more on this. But my point is simply that in my view certain social problems really are problems anywhere. I can't really imagine a situation where xenophobia is anything other than a negative phenomenon.

Obviously this is just my view, and contrary to what you suggest, I am capable of understanding that you and other people might disagree.",0,1341781936,null,0,false,0,c5b6t01,t3_w7x81,t1_c5b6t01,t1_c5b6kzy,null,1429327095,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The political system of the GDR was a sclerotic bureaucracy with a nasty secret police service that ruined many people's lives.

NS-Germany was a genocidal dictatorship that unleashed a World War that killed millions.

Equating the two by casual use of the term ""totalitarian"" for both is either naivete or malice.  Take your pick.

And FWIW, the wing of the SED that went on to form the PDS was primarily the pro-reform wing with sympathies for figures like Gorbachev.  The hardcore Stalinists generally lost all credibility after the Wende and retired from active politics.

Also, StoneCall's point about Mitl√§ufer is spot-on.  Of the two current co-chairs of Die Linke, one was a child during the Wende, while the other is a West German labor unionist.  Meanwhile, countless members of Blockparteien enjoy second political careers in the CDU.

Meanwhile, the current President of the Republic is a pastor who was free of persecution in the GDR and even enjoyed the right to travel when most citizens didn't.  The last interior minister of the GDR, Peter-Michael Diestel (CDU), says the content of Gauck's Stasi would be sufficient to keep anyone else from public service.  Hmmm.

When the Kohl government attempted to weaken sick pay, the unions called for massive protests in the capital.  It's one of the factors that paved the way for Red-Green.

But Schr√∂der was basically able to fundamentally do away with the post-war model of unemployment uninsurance in one fell swoop, and the unions issued barely a whimper.
