If you want to be away from the government or just people in general, you can go to Alaska. 

I mean yeah, it's not going to be easy, far from it. But it'll be a lot easier than moving out of the country and having to learn a new language, or suffering from a culture shock. I mean, despite America's huge variety and differences, we STILL have a common cultural identity and language to unite us. 

As for your disappointment in American Culture...well...that's a pretty broad statement...and well... straight up god damn wrong man.  I mean shit man, seriously? Most the **WORLD'S MEDIA** comes from America, California and New York to be specific. I mean, almost wherever you go, American Media and Literature are major forces. I mean shit, English is becoming the lingua franca of the world.

Yeah it was fucked up, yeah it should've never happened, but we can't change the past and we can't punish the innocent people who have lived here all their lives because of the misdeeds of their past government and/or their ancestors. 

I don't know what I am, my genetic history is plaqued with so many different fucking nationalities, include American-Indian, that I've stopped giving a fuck a while ago. But I do know one thing. I was born in this country and I've lived in this country all my life. Yeah..sure...some times I don't like it and the government fucks up...but dammit it is still my country. 

I mean I find a lot of people nowadays are either self-loathing (usually liberals) or blindly arrogant (usually conservatives) when it comes to viewing the Country. To be honest, I hate both passionately, and believe that yeah, you should never forget about your country's atrocities/crimes, but you should never try to hide it's accomplishments either.

Democracy is not a dictatorship of the majority. The potential problem is that there will be groups of people who enjoy the individual rights granted to everyone while not reciprocating.

Il confine è sottile tra ""fare una proposta politica"" e ""limitarsi a critiche distruttive"". A Grillo è impossibile dare al 100% torto, ma nel modo di fare è pericolosamente vicino al confine. Purtroppo è un atteggiamento che piace, ma che poi nei fatti non porta a niente (e in questo ricorda la Lega di Mani Pulite).

Trolling can be hilarious, if it's amusing, and sometimes, well, it's not even trolling - it's just funny.  I'm about as butt-white as it gets, and while I realize I have no oppression whatsoever to complain about, when someone takes the piss out of whatever ethnic/cultural/sociological group I belong to, and it's funny, well, it's funny.

The Pro-NRW goons are just thugs.  The only way they have any power at all is if someone pays attention to them.  I think it's extremely admirable when anyone belonging to a group targeted by people like them or the NDP in Germany, the FN in France, the SD in Switzerland, the BNP in the UK, or other right-wing fringe groups, just smirks and shrugs it off like the pathetic wannabe provocative bullshit it is.

The moment they do anything destructive or illegal (assault, vandalism, threats, disturbing the peace, etc.), I fully support going after them with the full force of the law.  But in the meantime, I honestly don't think that the kind of people who would submit a cartoon to their crypto-fascist little circlejerk would be witty enough to come up with anything funny, to be honest, and I have enough confidence in the intelligence of the average voter that they'll recognize it for the nonsense it is.

If a muslim can look at this sort of nasty, provocative attempts to nastily insult his religion as pathetic and not worthy of attention, then to me, personally, that's the highest level of political and philosophical discourse a democratic, open, free society has any hope of reaching.

For instance, there's more corruption now and the countries are smaller, which means you can't be as effective in areas like international politics. 

I just asked her what she thought about this. Her response: 

&gt;i wish i had data on this, i swear. the thing is that this is highly politicized and that many peoples feelings about this comes from the history of the family. e.g. my grandads were partizans, i.e. not nazis and were fighting in the resistance. my family history was quite yugoslav. i think our identity is yugoslav and i love my other YU brothers and sisters haha. personally i think we should have either stayed together (and reformed democratically into a federation) OR split up peacefully.

&gt;i don't care about nation-states much. many of my friends are equally friendly towards yugoslavia.

&gt;but also, many people aren't (people who think ethnicity counts for something etc)

&gt;and 80ties YU is much different than 50es YU. in the 50ties it was more iron fist, by the time tito died it was fairly loose....not even proper autocratic rule. that is why it blew up...

1) Like Italy or Spain, Greece is a EU country (part of the Shengen agreement for open borders) that by being on the Mediterranean Sea is an easy reach from North Africa. Truth be told, Greece is even easier to reach being geographically connected by land to Turkey, making it the perfect spot of transit for immigrant from both Asia and Africa.

2) Regardless of the current conditions, and the will to use it just as a point of passage for the rest of Europe (in Italy, for example, a large influx of illegal immigrant try to enter the country just as an intermediate point on the way to France, Germany and the rest of continental Europe), Greece was in recent year better of than most North and Sub Saharian countries, therefore still appealing.

From when Greece joined the Eurozone up until the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007, Greek ten-year bonds only yielded an average of 0.27% more than German ones. Private holders of those bonds had to give up roughly €100 billion of returns, the largest default in history.

&gt; now it's time to do so real work to tackle the crisis; everything before was stalling so the banks could get what they needed/wanted.

Greece has been cut off from the financial markets for two years now, and has only borrowed from the bailout fund at interest rates tied to slightly above of what the countries that finance it have to pay in interest to borrow that money themselves.

But I can't rule out that you know much more about all this than I do, and I'm always eager to learn. So, please, enlighten me how this is supposed to work.

sport is part of life. so, it is somewhat obvious that one could boycott a sporting event a s a mean to express political dissent. in almost all cases in the last few years, i always thought this was extremely hypocritical way of conducting business. hypocritical, demagogic, and frankly stupid and offensive.

why?

""Kiev"", that is Ukraine might very well be in need of a boycott. i don't know the ins and outs about their politics, so i don't think i'm the right person to judge. anyway, if the EU, or anyone wants to boycott Ukraine, Euro 2012 should be the last of a long, long, long list of other boycotts that should come first.

according to [this source] (/http://ec.europa.eu/trade/creating-opportunities/bilateral-relations/countries/ukraine/), EU exported €17.3 billion worth of goods in Ukraine in 2010. wanna boycott Ukraine? stop exporting your goods there.

according to the same source, Ukraine exported iron, steel, mining products, agricultural products, and machinery for €11.4 millions towards EU countries. wanna boycott Ukraine? stop buying their products.

how about the gas that pass through Ukraine? some would argue that if they take a penny in the process, we should boycott that, too.

is UEFA kicking out Ukraine, too? that's boycotting that makes sense, on a sporting level, expecially if UEFA pressures FIFA to stop having relationships with the Ukraine federation. How about Ukrainian players around Europe? boycott means that they should go home, no matter how good. same goes with ""normal"" workers, of course.

AFTER all of these things are in place, THEN i can consider any idea of boycotting EURO 2012 to have any ground. otherwise, it's just a pointless act with no real repercussions, a slap in the face to:

1. all the players that really want to compete, because their career might depend on this championship

Do I condone such violence? No, but frankly, I don't give a shit. I am military, so if they order me to go keep the order and if necessary shoot people, I'll go shoot people. I am color/religion/ethnicity-blind on that matter.


Anyhow, I am in favor of legal, controlled immigration as done by the US in the past. I've studied and lived abroad, so I know how it is to be away from home, in the midst of strangers, trying to make a life for myself. The difference is that when I was an expat I tried to integrate into the local society. In Greece this doesn't happen with a lot of illegal immigrants, they are not here to stay, but to try and pass through to the rest of the EU and specifically Western Europe. Taking that into consideration, no-one will blink an eye if there are mass deportations of illegal immigrants from Greece. If the deportations don't happen in a civilized and peaceful way, so that the country is relieved fro a burden that cannot be endured, the far right will be the one setting policies, even if they are not the primary policy-makers. (There aren't any jobs and money for the Greeks, you think there will be  jobs and money for immigrants? Yeah, right!). Guess what those policies will include?

This situation will end up with more immigrants dead, take the word of a man on site. This is my assessment of the situation.

Successive Turkish governments did little to tackle the problem; they signed agreements but accept only a small percentage of these immigrants back. If they honoured their signatures, they would have to spend a part of their budget for taking care of them.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"What we need are convincing and realistic plans for economic restructuring in those countries that are having problems. That's one area where the focus should be on right now. In the case of Spain, this means finding something to replace what used to be the construction sector with.

Many of those policies are free, others actually require investment. To make the money for the latter available, apart from having those convincing plans in the first place, is a real unified common financial policy in the EU, or at least the Eurozone. This will be at the cost of national sovereignty, which makes it politically difficult, but it will be hard enough to convince voters in Germany et al. to accept long-term monetary transfers as it is. If they just have to transfer money without there being any constraints to how this money will be spent in the recipient countries, this won't happen.   
To help countries like Spain to become more competitive without having to go through internal deflation, the ECB should increase the inflation target. The value of the euro needs to go down, wages in the more efficient economies need to go up, while the others try to hold theirs stable.

But Spain leaving the Eurozone? I don't think this is a good idea. You can't leave the Eurozone without leaving the EU. If you had savings, and Spain would be about to leave the Eurozone, would you leave those savings in Spain to be devaluated? Wouldn't you sell those assets that can be sold to move your money elsewhere? Wouldn't you withdraw all the cash you could to carry it across the border, especially since your debt would be devaluated as well? It would have to happen over night, capital controls would have to be put in place, and all the cash you'd withdraw would have to have a stamp that said ""peseta"" on it until new cash would be available to replace it with.  
Contracts would have to be rewritten, especially those with business partners across the border. Even those within Spain would have to be renegotiated, since imports that have to payed in euros or dollars often play into the price. Salaries would be difficult to simply convert as well -- especially receivers of low incomes spend a large share of their income on things where energy prices and transportation cost are a large factor, and with a devaluated currency, oil and gas imports would become relatively more expensive.

Investors unwilling to invest right now will be even less willing to buy bonds of a country that has returned to its old currency for the sole purpose of being able to devaluate. This has never been done before, and for the reasons I've mentioned above the outlook for the Spanish economy would be uncertain at best. How much interest would you ask for if you were to buy a Spanish bond after such a move?

tl;dr: This would be economic suicide. Not gonna happen.",0,1335921457,null,0,false,0,c4iz6db,t3_t2bit,t1_c4iz6db,t3_t2bit,null,1428837442,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well shit, the British Empire definitely didn't pull 99% of the weight, nor is English as prevalent as it is solely because of them. And while I may be overestimating my country's importance, your most definately underestimating it. We contributed heavily to both World Wars (and affected the outcomes of both accordingly) and we were the key member NATO through-out the Cold War. We have the largest economy in the world (soon to be usurped by China) and the number of foreign businesses we have established just go to cement this fact. So as far as global relations go, at least at the moment, we are the most preeminent force when it comes to militaries or business. 

As for my third point, I'll back it up with something you, yourself, said:

&gt;Yes, American movies do play at the local theater. TV shows and music a bit less.

If there's one thing that spreads a nation's culture more than the sword, it's the T.V. and Radio. How many Serbian movies do you think are playing in my local theater? How many Serbian shows do you think I watch? How much Serbian music do you think I listen to? *None*. Other than the internet, it's not accessible to me. I mean if I looked for it, than sure, I could find it, but I don't. 

You have American Movies playing at your local theaters. You have American shows on TV and American music on the radio. Yet, even though you experience this EVERY DAY, you still stand here and tell me that the British Empire pulled 99% of the weight when it comes to making English the Langu Franca? That's just not arrogant, it's ignorant. I mean shit, right now, your talking to me on a AMERICAN WEBSITE. Not a British one. 

&gt;Not sure what you mean by super power?

Well, in my opinion, it's the ability to lead the world in the areas of Culture, Bussiness and the Military. The Soviet Union was the only other nation at the time who could rival us in these areas, but when the Soviets fell, we remained the sole dominant nation in these areas (Although the E.U., Brazil, India, Russia &amp; China are hot on our tale atm).

1. As far as business goes, we have the largest economy in the world. (But China will change that soon...and so with the E.U. if they integrate further and don't implode...which looks pretty plausible atm)

2. As far as culture goes, there's few places on the Globe you can go and not see the influence of American Culture. You yourself have admitted you can go to a local movie theater and see a American Movie. You live on another continent, but you regularly hear both our music and watch our TV shows. 

3. Militarily we stand unchallenged, and will continue to do for the foreseeable future. We have the ability to project our power ANYWHERE on the globe at ANY TIME. Yes, other nations can do this, but not at the great degree we can. China may have three times as many soldiers as us, but that means jackshit when you have neither the material nor technology to move/equip those troops. I also like to remind you that almost every Joint-European Mission has HAD to have U.S. leadership/logistical support, lest it prove either a failure or it's results unsatisfactory. Libya and Kosovo (something I'm sure you know much more about) are prime examples of a Joint-European Military Mission needing our leadership and logistical support, and the examples range far beyond and way further back (Post WWII) than either of those two.

I'm excited for you. I've been in Granada, Spain for the past 4 months and its been the best experience of my life.

 My first piece of advice for you is to just relax and embrace the awkward moments of discomfort that come from being an American in Spain. Simply put, our manner of dress is just distinct from theirs (in subtle ways) and it's not really possible to ""dress Spanish"" unless you buy another wardrobe in Spain. So no, you shouldn't worry about dressing in a certain manner. The most important thing about this experience is for you to ***be yourself***. Just thing about how you would dress here in the States. You probably wouldn't wear basketball shorts to lunch with the family on a Sunday, so don't do it in Spain. Having said that, if you're one of those kids that always wears basketball shorts, fucking wear basketball shorts because that's who you are. To pose a personal example. if I'm doing a lot of walking I'll wear boots instead of my more stylish yet less comfortable shoes. My boots stick out a little bit if I end up at a bar by the end of the night, but what's more important to me is comfort. In the end, don't change yourself to try and appeal to the Spanish more. Be yourself and be genuine, and in this way you will make yourself appealing to others. 

One day in Madrid? If you like art, go to the Prado Art Museum. There's some incredible artwork there. Not particular to art? Walk, walk, and walk! Get a coffee at a cafe and people watch. Definitely make your way to the Palacio Real. If you're feeling very energetic you can do the Prado Museum and Palacio by foot in a day no problem.  As for restaurants, I know there's this market (it looks like a glass box) relatively close to Plaza Mayor that has a bunch of little booths that you go up to and order from. There's a large selection of seafood/etc on long toothpicks and you just point to two or three and the guy gives them to you. They should be 1-2 euros a piece. Order a beer and walk around the market eating these delicious morsels. I plan on going back when I'm in Madrid in a month.  

Mannerisms and customs? Like I said, be yourself. That is, unless you're a doochebag. Don't be a doochebag. Be compliant with their requests/house rules and hang out with them and talk. Don't come home drunk (or at least do it when they're asleep already). If they ask you to be home before a certain time, do it. Spanish people shouldn't expect you to change to their customs (certainly not in one month) and you should also realize that this is a cultural experience for them too; whatever you do/wear/eat/drink/think will ultimately contribute in some way to the Spanish people's perception of America and its citizens.

Yes you did contribute WWII. Heavily only on the Pacific. The US military involvement in Europe was negligible - save for Omaha beach landings, there really wasn't that much. The US did however help the Allies with supplies.

ENGLISH was the World's predominant language WAY BEFORE the US even existed. India, 3/4 of Africa, Australia, New Zealand, half of China all spoke English before the US was even established as a country. It was even spreading throughout Europe because it is an easy language and people wanted to do business with the British Empire. The fact that there are American movies showing at my local theater has nothing to do with English becoming lingua franca. 

Of course you have the largest economy in the world. There are over 310 million of you! Population-wise, you are only surpassed by China and India, the latter is an undeveloped nation, and the former is slowly becoming developed. 

The American Culture as such doesn't really exist. It is an artificial creation and a meld of all the other cultures (not that there is anything wrong with that). The reason it spread so well was because it borrowed from everyone, and had something to give back to everyone. We Serbs adapt some of our culture to the American one, but only the parts that originally came from Serbia (and Yugoslavia).

true,bonzinip,lombardia,,"* Only use olive oil except for frying (use sunflower or peanut oil, aka frying oil) and cooking meat (use butter unless you're stewing it; butter is also good for light-flavored fish, for example sole or halibut). You need very small amounts, do not be afraid to buy more expensive ones.

* Tomato goes well with olives, capers, raisins (in moderate amount), eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers. Always prepare a light _soffritto_ with thinly-cut onions (or shallot or even leek) and let the onion become light yellow to transparent before adding tomato or any other vegetable. One middle-size shallot is good for 4-6 servings of tomato sauce.

* Experiment with variations on tomato (prepared as above) for your pasta. Other choices are carbonara (egg with diced bacon, or you can make a veggie version with zucchini instead of bacon). Anchovies, salmon, mushrooms, diced ham or peas go well with cream (_not_ sour cream) and a little bit of milk; experiment with a little bit of soffritto to remove the sweet flavor of dairy. Less common versions, but still with a mediterranean flavor is with ricotta and raw julienne zucchini (and olive oil) or anchovies or salmon. Other basic dressings include ""aglio, olio e peperoncino"" (heat garlic and ground chili in oil, remove the garlic when it is soft, and stir the pasta in the oil) or ""cacio e pepe"" (pepper and massive amounts of ground ""cacio"" cheese&amp;mdash;no parmesan!&amp;mdash; and oil). Grind cheese while the pasta is still very hot so that it melts.

* Resist your temptation to throw vinegar, cream cheese, sugar, ketchup in the pan.  There are some exceptions of course (e.g. sugar with onions and vinegar with bell peppers), but stick to the basics. Replace cream cheese with ricotta.

* Do not dice any cheese except mozzarella---and if you cook it only add very moderate amounts, or you'll get an inextricable web of cheese.

* The only allowed side dishes are salad (see below) or vegetables, typically baked or lightly stewed: carrots, zucchini, eggplant, fennel, potatoes, peas, chard, spinach, mushrooms. Buy your vegetables fresh or frozen. Throw away those cans! (_edit_: we do use some cans, especially for tomatoes, beans and peas, where the vegetables are pre-cooked and preserved in water).

* Be creative in your salads! Choose between all kinds of raw vegetables (tomato, julienne carrots, celery, olives, fennel, or even avocado), canned tuna fish, diced mozzarella, boiled eggs.  _But_ dress with salt and/or pepper, vinegar (and even orange juice if you feel a little adventurous), olive oil, nothing else.  Put liquids that dissolve salt _before_ the olive oil.

* Also be creative with herbs: parsley, rosemary, thyme, sage, marjoram, oregano, chives... they are your friend. Flush pre-made dressings and vinaigrettes down the toilet, as Andaru said simple condiments are the best.

* Use very simple toppings for pizza. Besides tomato and mozzarella, choose just one/two among thinly-sliced grilled vegetables, anchovies, oregano, ham.  In other words, once more stick to the basics. :) Cook pizza at high temperature (225 C, 430 F) so that the mozzarella doesn't make the dough wet. Add ham only a couple of minutes before serving if you chose it.

* Good broth (stock) is indispensable for soups and risotto.  You can prepare vegetable broth very easily with your choice of carrots, celery, potato, fennels, peas or even pumpkin. Throw them in water in largish pieces, boil it for one hour or two, then take out part of the liquid and mash the rest to make an instant soup. Experiment and find your favorite! Freeze the broth for a healthier replacement for pre-made soup.  We do use pre-made stock though; try to find [meat extract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_extract) instead of bouillon cubes to get a more natural flavor (no glutamate), but remember that you need to add salt unlike with cubes.",0,1335951417,null,0,true,0,c4j422x,t3_t26ot,t1_c4j422x,t3_t26ot,null,1428839811,15,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,15

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Yes you did contribute WWII. Heavily only on the Pacific. The US military involvement in Europe was negligible - save for Omaha beach landings, there really wasn't that much. The US did however help the Allies with supplies.

Negligible? Granted, the Soviets took the brunt of the casualties, but the United States managed to keep not only them afloat, but also Britain afloat, with the Lend-Lease Program in the early part of the war. The Soviets eventually got most their industrial capacity back, but for a while there we were supplying them with some pretty essential supplies that I don't know if they'd be able to do without. 

I also like to remind you that if it wasn't for the United States helping open up the Western Front, I guarantee you that the Soviet Union would have kept on steaming on through Germany and right on to the English Channel. The Iron Curtain would'nt have only extended just over Eastern Europe, it would've extended over ALL of Europe, maybe Great Britain as a exception, but that is suspect. 

&gt;ENGLISH was the World's predominant language WAY BEFORE the US even existed. India, 3/4 of Africa, Australia, New Zealand, half of China all spoke English before the US was even established as a country. It was even spreading throughout Europe because it is an easy language and people wanted to do business with the British Empire. The fact that there are American movies showing at my local theater has nothing to do with English becoming lingua franca.

That right there is bullshit. The United States was declared on **July 4, 1776**. The British won the Battle of Waterloo on **June 8, 1815**. It was ONLY after Waterloo that the British Empire, as we knew it, began to take form and it was only after Waterloo that we saw anything resembling Pax Britannica. 

&gt;The American Culture as such doesn't really exist. It is an artificial creation and a meld of all the other cultures (not that there is anything wrong with that). The reason it spread so well was because it borrowed from everyone, and had something to give back to everyone. We Serbs adapt some of our culture to the American one, but only the parts that originally came from Serbia (and Yugoslavia). I could just as easily claim that you do actually care for Serbia because part of the US culture is Serbian.

Our Culture (along with ALL culture for that matter) is a artificial creation, but the people who thought it up, the place where it was imagined, are American. America is a melting pot, we're one of, if not the most, diverse country on the planet. Just because it's not British, or Serbian, or Russian, doesn't make it not as good or not worth talking about, much less unworthy of being considered ""culture"". Like it or not, IT IS our culture. It unites us and it's something we can all relate too. America wasn't like Yugoslavia, because even though each of our states are geographically, demographically, politically, culturally and linguistically (as far as accents go) different, there are still underpinnings that unite us. 

I can move between any of the fifty states and I would still be treated as a fellow countrymen, as a American. And just like our many different states, I grantee you that when you go through all our different forms of entertainment, you will see the underpinnings which connect each and make it *""American""*. 

Our culture is no different than yours. It is not inferior to British Culture, to Serbian Culture, to any culture. 

And what's worse, your not only telling me that my culture's worse, your telling me it basically doesn't exist. AND YOU HAVE AMERICAN MOVIES IN YOUR LOCAL THEATRES! You hear American Music and watch American TV shows, and yet you stand here, telling me that American Culture doesn't exist? Come on man...what the fuck....

&gt;Always remember: your country is not great if YOU say that it is. Your country is great if others say that it is. I can just as easily now brag about how Serbia dominated Europe and make up some facts and convince myself that Serbs are a Messiah sent to save the mankind. But as long as all the others claim otherwise, my claim is pointless.

There's a difference though, because I'm not making up facts or telling you that Americans are the Messiah. And I could give two shits if others don't think my country is great, because it's my country, and when it comes to judging it, I feel the citizens who actually live there should be the ones too do it. 

I mean shit, look at what you sterotyping me as a ""typical militarily-brainwashed Americans from the South"". Do you think your the first to say that about my nation's citizens? Every day I log on to Reddit I see some bullshit about how I and my fellow citizens are ""Stupid and fat"", about how my government is a ""tyrannical monstrosity led by fundie theists"". 

Do you know how I was before I came to Reddit? I was like any other Self-Loathing Teenager looking for reasons to hate my country. And I was happy at first, because so many people shared my sentiment. But then...idk...something changed. As more and more people began ragging on my country, on me and my fellow citizens, well.....I grew arrogant. I'll admit. Nationalist thoughts and pride have really begun to take traction in my mind. I got tired, tired of being called fat and stupid, tired of being told my country was a horrible place, and so I began reminding people of our accomplishments. 

Because Deusdies, deep down, I know my Country has done some horrible fucking shit. I know about MK-ULTRA. I know about my government deliberately infecting black citizens in Alabama during the 50s with Syphilis to study the results. I know of us funding the Viet Cong during WWII to fight the Japanese. I know of us funding Al-Qaeda and the Mujaheddin to fight the Soviets. 

But I also know of our achievements, which are too many and too far-reaching to list. I know of the good we've done. I know of the rights and liberties my government has guaranteed me in it's constitution. And I know that this is my homeland, where I was born and raised. 

The Good will never erase the Bad, and the Bad will never erase the Good. 

But I, personally, think my country has done A LOT more good than bad. I believe much of the bad was done with the Greater Good in mind. **That's why I love my country. THAT'S why I think my country is great.** Not because somebody on another continent thinks so, but because of the conclusion I, myself, have come too.

You will be expected to ""dar besos"" (give kisses) to any of-age Spanish female you meet for the first time. To do this, simply move your head left and press your right cheek against her right cheek, kiss, and repeat again, moving your head right. 

You don't need to do this for guys.

You probably don't need to do this for any foreigners you meet who are also in Spain, unless they're from another latin culture. Note that Italians give besos backwards, starting with the left cheeks, so be prepared for a bit of confusion.

Less children comming for drugs and industrial music means the clubs first of all have to fire mediocre DJs and maybe use music under CCL3.
Also the cheap clubs have to fire the bouncers...and EVERYBODY hates the bouncers.
And best...it'll be fair for the artists! No more nites with just David Guetta. No more DJs that just copy and repeat the sets of moonbootica or dj kicks.... 

I love the idea of GEMA raising the costs! It means the end to crappy music. Yet I feel sorry for all event managers...but believe it or not...they have to work on a new concept. If we are lucky - already this summer- events will book the real artists instead of downloading some shitty summer-mix CD and complain about the fees.
Nobody wanted Wham during christmas...and nobody wanted Brian Adams EVERY summer.

For internet, I recommend mobicarte from Orange, with the ""bon plan Internet max"" at 9 EUR/month (you don't care about the duration since you stay only 10days). This has to be activated separately from you phone one the telephone number is alive. This provides 500Mb, which should be sufficient for most needs.

Beware that Orange site is a complete mess, let alone if you don't speak french.

I think the SIM card costs around 15 EUR, with 5 EUR of credit provided. The rates are not great, but for Internet it's a bargain, and overall prepaid is expensive (less than roaming though).

You don't say where you are coming from, but you should know that in Europe mobile phones are more expensive to call, and therefore the calling numbers are in a space different from landlines. On the other hand receiving calls are free. However since there is some war on the prices happening in France now, the difference in price are waning as more and more people have unlimited-calling plans.

Last but not least, if you want to benefit from UMTS, you need a phone supporting UMTS-2100 (a lot of handsets support this) and in rural areas UMTS-900 (which is NOT the case for iphones before 4G).

Je la vois un peu comme une pente généralement ascendante et un peu dentelée. Par exemple, aujourd'hui il reste des gens qui sont honnêtement royalistes en France. Depuis 200 ans, une révolution et plusieurs restaurations, ils se raréfient, reprennent de la vigueur de temps à autres, mais sont tout de même en voie de disparition. L'Histoire ne fait pas demi-tour.
Le monde se libéralise, et s'ouvre de plus en plus. Le transport est simple et de plus en plus accessible et l'information circule de mieux en mieux grâce à internet... tout ça, en dépis de tout ce que tentent les gouvernements pour restreindre ce que certains jugent comme une liberté excessive. Et je ne parle pas que de Sarkozy et Hadopi ou de Le Pen qui utilise le mot ""libertaire"" comme une injure. A gauche aussi ça craint la perte de souveraineté, ou d'acquis sociaux à travers une uniformisation d'un monde moins social en moyenne que la France. 

Donc tout le monde a quelque chose a y perdre, mais chacun décide s'il veut se préserver et à quel prix, ou s'il participe à la mise en oeuvre de l'inévitable (parfois pour tirer son épingle du jeu, le premier devrait peut-être faire comme le second, mais ce n'est que mon opinion).

Pour conclure, ce que tu évoques sur les régionalistes est peut être un bon exemple. La Bretagne fait bel et bien partie de la France et le régionalisme pose un souci de division. A mon sens, on peut transposer ce schéma à plus grande échelle entre la France et l'Europe, puis l'Europe et le monde. Et le jour où les aliens débarquent, je préfère faire partie de leur monde que de me dire terrien avant tout et vouloir me maintenir à l'écart. J'aime trop apprendre des trucs.

Merci pour les explications en tout cas. Pour ma part, je n'irai pas voter car je n'ai jamais été inscrit, ne croyant pas vraiment vivre en démocratie. Deux raisons : Aussi loin que je me souvienne, j'ai toujours pu prévoir le gagnant d'une élection présidentielle au moins un an à l'avance (depuis 88). Et démocratie, ça veut dire le peuple au commandes... moi je ne vois que des médecins, avocats et hauts fonctionnaires, tous de la même classe sociale au pouvoir. C'est pas représentatif.

Obviously, the soviets were internationalist socialists (they wanted to bring the whole world to a classless state) while nazis,as the name indicates, were national socialists, that is socialism mixed with nationalism. If you read the speeches of the national socialists, specially at the start, they are all about liberating the workers from the bourgeois opresion (left wing enough? ;) ).

You can see the same in other countries.

true,underwaterlove,EURO,European Union,"The left-right distinction is a little less clear than the capitalist-communist dichotomy. What also contributes to the confusion is that several founding members where clearly sympathizing with the ideals of socialism or communism. What initially tied famous Nazis like [Gregor Strasser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor\_Strasser) into the early National Socialist school of thought wasn't the rampant capitalism that the NSDAP very freely promoted during its reign, but simply the militarism and antisemitism of the movement.

The issue I have when people point out the ""Socialism"" part in the NSDAP's name is that we tend to think of socialism in the terms laid out by Marx, as a societal phase and intermediary step between capitalism and communism. Just as we think of liberalism in US politics as left-wing rather than in terms of the classical liberalism of John Locke or Adam Smith. And in that sense, the NSDAP, throughout its reign, wasn't a socialist party.

The Nazis certainly were in favor of state control - they hardly were libertarians (or classical liberals) after all - but they certainly were capitalists. All prominent advocates of socialism or a left-wing form of antisemitism and totalitarianism (like Strasser, for example) were purged in the [Night of the Long Knives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night\_of\_the\_Long\_Knives), the Third Reich oversaw the largest privatization of state owned property in the world, private property (except for any property owned by Jews) was still very much protected by the state throughout the reign of the Nazis, and even in 1945, the war machine still relied on private companies to supply the military. In fact, the state even supplied slave labor from the concentration camps *to* the German industry. Against payment, obviously.

Some ideological remnants from the party's beginnings - like the [25-point Program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National\_Socialist\_Program#German\_Party\_program), proclaimed as the NSDAP's everlasting party program in 1920 - remained in place, but no program points that were vaguely socialist were actually ever implemented. Hitler even had to go so far as to ""clarify"" the real meaning of the party program when it eventually came under criticism from German industrialists.

So in summary: no matter what ideological underpinnings the original DAP had, the NSDAP which ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945 was clearly not a socialist party.",0,1335982753,null,0,false,0,c4j979r,t3_t347h,t1_c4j979r,t1_c4j8nen,null,1428842301,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

If you put the bar so high, Europe has no left wing (apart from some extremely minor parties without even representation in the parlaments). So if the modern european left wing accepts private property, why is that the NSDAP accepting private property makes them capitalist and not left wing? The left wing parties are also very well financed and with ties with industrialists. Even Marx was well financed during his early life.

When you say the NSDAP promoted clearly capitalist policies, the defenders of capitalism will argue you are wrong. But then I have had communist argue that Stalin was in reality a state capitalist.

What I was trying to say is not that the national socialist should be considered left wing or right wing, but that the lines are much more blury and the clasification is quite incoherent.

Not necessarily.

Of the previous population, the last one was shot 1904 (being a rare case at that time, wolves having been successfully extinguished during a famine in the middle ages), as far as I can tell it's forbidden to hunt wolves since 1974.

As said, it takes ages, ten times that number would still be few, a hundredfold might actually have an impact on the deer population. Even if you account for illegally shot wolves, they, like all predators, don't multiply like rabbits or, for that matter, deer and wild boars.

You are right with the lip syncing. However, the translation text is most likely the same. Very often the sound engineers and dialogue directors change the words to make it more appealing to the ear. A written translation is always more accurate and true to the original, but very often doesn't sound so nice when spoken aloud.

Another thing is that there is never a 100% correct translation. Give one text to 10 different translators and you get 10 different, but still correct translations. It happens that the subtitle translator team is a different one than those for the dubbing. 

Regarding the time thing. The Avengers and Hunger Games have a very basic language level. It's meant for a wider audience therefore it's kept simple. Simple English is easy to translate. Prometheus on the other hand is a different league of language. Even from the trailers I can guarantee you that the language is more sofisticated and complex.

true,underwaterlove,EURO,European Union,"&gt;But again its all very debatable, because if we use the strict parameters you are imposing on the Nazis, you can hardly call any of the modern parties in europe socialist or left wing.

Well, here's the issue: National Socialism, as a political platform with verifiable results, existed for only 12 years, and only in one country. It's pretty straightforward to define it in many regards: leftists, socialists and communist sympathizers in the party were liquidated when the party came to power. Right-wingers and state capitalists were promoted. Nationally, communists, socialists and social democrats were rounded up, thrown in concentration camps and executed. The list goes on and on, but overall, it's fairly consistent for the 1933-1945 timeframe.

Socialism, on the other hand, has been claimed by various parties in dozens of countries for more than a century. It's a lot harder to pinpoint any kind of philosophy that *all* of those strains would have in common. Socialism in Nicaragua looks different from socialism in the former East bloc or socialism in Zimbabwe or Indonesia. Add to that that right-wingers in the United States will call anything ""socialism"" that is not a system of unbridled free market capitalism, and the only definition of socialism that you're left with is ""anything that is not ultra-libertarian, minimal government free market capitalism"".

Obviously, that's not helpful either. A strict Marxist interpretation would leave us with no socialist party in Europe, but a very wide interpretation would mean that even the Tories or the Christian Conservatives would qualify as ""socialists"".

&gt;So if the modern european left wing accepts private property, why is that the NSDAP accepting private property makes them capitalist and not left wing?

Simply because it's one thing in a long list of items. Just as an example, look at the parties the NSDAP formed coalitions with before becoming the nation's single party. What you'll find there are generally right-wing, nationalist, conservative, militarist or industrialist parties.

* The [German National People's Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German\_National\_People%27s\_Party) was a nationalist, antisemitist, conservative-monarchist party
* The [Thüringer Landbund](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%BCringer\_Landbund) was a nationalist, conservative farmer's party
* The [Reich Party of the German Middle Class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reich\_Party\_of\_the\_German\_Middle\_Class), a bourgeois-conservative economic/industrialist party
* The [German People's Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German\_People%27s\_Party) was the party of German industrialists

Then look at the parties they actively opposed, to the point of throwing members into concentration camps and executing them once they were in power:

* The [Communist Party of Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist\_Party\_of\_Germany): the party was banned immediately, and thousands of members ended up in concentration camps
* The [Social Democratic Party of Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spd): the party was banned in summer of 1933. Many members ended up in concentration camps, many went into exile.
* The [Socialist Workers' Party of Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist\_Workers%27\_Party\_of\_Germany): this party remained active during the Third Reich, working in the German resistance against the Nazis
* The [International Communists of Germany](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationale\_Kommunisten\_Deutschlands\_\(1933\)): this party was a Trotskyist splinter party which originally opposed the Communist Party's Bolshevism-Leninism, but continued to remain active in the German resistance during the Third Reich

See the pattern?

What made the NSDAP right-wing was not just their stance on private property, but their general political platform - which in turn dictated which parties they would form coalitions with. And none of those coalition parties were on the left side of the spectrum.

&gt;When you say the NSDAP promoted clearly capitalist policies, the defenders of capitalism will argue you are wrong. But then I have had communist argue that Stalin was in reality a state capitalist.

Well, here's the problem: many people believe that capitalism (the economic system) and libertarianism (the political system) are synonymous. Libertarianism demands minimal government interference. Capitalism relies on private property, on (relatively) free markets and on the free exchange of goods and services for profit. Libertarianism and capitalism are therefore a natural match. However, there's nothing which would keep an otherwise oppressive dictatorship from allowing for all of the necessary ingredients of capitalism: Chile under Pinochet ""disappeared"" thousands of people, but was widely praised by American economists for its laissez-faire, free market economy. China is an authoritarian surveillance state, but has recently become famous for its rogue capitalism.

What made the Nazis brand of capitalism fall on the right side of the spectrum was that it generally favored German industrialists more than German workers, and that it stood very much in contrast to the models proposed by Social Democrats, Socialists or Communists.",0,1335996947,null,0,false,0,c4jcn5e,t3_t347h,t1_c4jcn5e,t1_c4j9s2k,null,1428843922,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

To me it seems there are two possibilities, the first being that there was a pocket of Romans secluded from Italians that kept their culture and identity intact throughout centuries and the migration of other peoples.

Or, that Romanians are mostly descendant from other peoples, and the Roman/Dacian identity was invented for nationalistic purposes. After all, it's easier to call the other ethnic groups invaders if your ancestors were there before theirs. Of course, thats all silly as gene pools naturally mix.

I'm asking why a petition that **will be delivered to the Bundestag** isn't using the legally binding system in place for the express purpose of delivering petitions to the Bundestag - and instead opts to use some third party that can be shrugged off easily without any repercussions. 

To be clear: Every single German could sign the Openpetition.de petition and it wouldn't mean a thing. 

Compare that to having just 0.1% of that, aka 80k Germans, sign an epetition. 

If more than 50k signatures are collected they either need to have a public hearing of the petitioner, which will be shown on Television and the official VoD page of the Bundestag. Alternatively they need to scrape together a 2/3rd majority to dismiss that, which won't really happen unless the petition is, frankly, written in a way that even politicians can see it holds no water.

Firstly I'm sure you'll love the place. Great weather, metropolitan / city lifestyle plus the beach and parks and very laid back atmosphere. It's one of the best places I've ever visited and certainly the best I've lived.

So, I've only been here a year but to answer your questions:

Look for apartments / rooms on [Loquo.com](http://www.loquo.com/en_us) [barcelona.craigslist](http://barcelona.en.craigslist.es/) and [Idealista](http://idealista.com). They all offer private listings by landlords which don't require going through an agent (although a few agents list on those sites as well - look for the email addresses / websites supplied). You should look to pay between 280 and 400 for a double room in the centre of town or a decent area like Poblenou / Eixample / Gracia. This would usually include all your bills and you would be sharing the apartment with 1-3 other people. One month's rent as a deposit is normal.

What should you bring from the UK? A summer wardrobe, maybe health insurance if you won't be covered as a non-EU citizen. That's probably it.

The location of Vila Olympica Metro is just the other side of the Ciutadella Park which is the border of the city centre's 3 main districts (from left to right looking at a map) Raval, Gothico and Born. When you get to Ciutadella Park it stops being Born and turns in to another area. Vila Olympica Metro is around 5-10mins walk to the near edge of Born.

The city's nightlife is very spread out depending on what you are looking for - large clubs are grouped around port olympic as well as others dotted around the city, jazz clubs can be found in the centre down dark alleyways and a bar that looks like only old alcoholics would drink in may turn in to a live music fest without warning. Personally some favourite spots are Antic Theatr, Big Bang, Jazzroom.

[Here's a blog post](http://travel.afdit.co.uk/uncategorized/best-of-barcelona/) a I wrote (inc map) of the places I usually mention to new arrivals.

Let me know if you need any other specifics or if you fancy doing a Reddit meetup when you arrive.
