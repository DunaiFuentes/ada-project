true,[deleted],null,null,"The reputation isn't the most dangerous here, as the US will pretty much always be an ally of most of Europe.

The real fear is based on the prospects of Mitts policies, which increases the transfer of wealth from the poor and middle class to the richest. 

The US would then set precedents for the whole alliance, and legitimizes the corruption and destruction of a very basic part of a healthy and functioning democracy and welfare state. 

The second problem that adds upon this is the new and up coming technologies that can be used to supress dissenters and political critisism. 

We will soon live in a time where autocrats or plutocrats can control their population indefinitively with the aid of upcoming digital surveillance. 

If Mitt were to further increase and consolidate power for the government, I have a legitimate fear that there would be a change of power-balance where the democracy is effectively hijacked completely. 

If there is 10 steps from democracy to autocracy, the US government has already gone the first 4-7 steps, with NDAA, Patriot Act, FBI face surveillance, Gitmo, shadow courts and numerous other post-9/11 policies, many enacted by Bush and some expanded by Obama.

Furthermore you should check out Hamburg(indie/alternative culture, awesome harbor, shitty weather), Berlin(trust me on this one, it's great) and Amsterdam(not Germany, but worth visiting when you're in Europe). 

Germany also has lots and lots of festivals in the summer, you should check out if there are some that cater to your taste of music during your stay in Germany and check one out.

And since this is a good time to mention it: If you want to get around in Germany you should check out http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de/ a lot of Germans list free places in their cars when they take trips on that homepage, you can then call them and ride along for a fee, which beats the prices for train and there's no equivalent to greyhound buses in Germany, so it's how we get around for cheap.

However, if you are going to stay longer than three months you will need to apply for your residencia, which is a much more detailed process (let me know if you want me to explain it to you).

La télé est certes mauvaise pour les yeux, comme tous les écrans, et certains contenus sont fait pour nous faire sentir bien dans la médiocrité, mais je ne pense pas que télé = fléau de façon directe. C'est plutot le temps que ça gaspille et qui pourrait être dépensé dans des activités constructives qui induit cette nuisance selon moi.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;NDAA, Patriot Act, FBI face surveillance, Gitmo, shadow courts and numerous other post-9/11 policies, many enacted by Bush and some expanded by Obama.

These are very complicated issues, and I can't fully explain how responsibility should be apportioned between Congress and Obama for all of them, but I can tell you that the objectionable provisions in NDAA 2012 and the continued existence of Gitmo are primarily Congress' fault.

First, there is an NDAA every year.  It is the annual bill that authorizes funding for the military.  Without it, the US military would be in crisis, as its funding would be withheld.  The Republicans knew that Obama had to pass an NDAA.  So, the congressional Republicans attached two provisions that attracted lots of controversy; they basically mandated the military detention of foreigners who were suspected of terrorism (the rumor that the provisions applied to citizens was false).

Obama threatened to veto the 2012 NDAA if it contained that language, but Republicans didn't back down.  Ultimately, Obama didn't veto the NDAA, because in the US, the President cannot only veto part of a bill.  He'd have to veto the entire thing, which would have included vetoing the funding for the US military, and he decided that would be neither responsible nor politically wise.

Instead, he killed the provisions with bureaucracy.

The President is tasked with enforcing federal law.  So therefore, the President gets to issue guidelines that dictate how federal laws are enforced.  Obama issued enforcement guidelines that completely neutered the mandatory military detention provisions.  Specifically, the guidelines state that the automatic detention provision only applies if all the following occur: 

1) The detainee is not a legal permanent resident of the US; 2) the detainee was not captured by law enforcement (so he would have to have been captured by the military); 3) the detainee's home nation does not object to the military detention; 4) the President does not object to the military detention; and 5) the detainee was captured/arrested for an act of terrorism.

It is important to note that the US military is forbidden by law from carrying out law enforcement, so the only way a terrorist could be detained by the military is if he or she were in combat with the military or attacking a military base.

Why did Republicans insist on those provisions in NDAA 2012?  I don't think they had any reason other than to get Obama to sign something that would disillusion and upset his base of supporters.  The US already had things like Gitmo and the PATRIOT Act.  The NDAA provisions served no purpose other than to embarrass Obama and make re-election harder for him.

Next, there's the Gitmo issue.  This one is simple.  Obama ordered Gitmo closed.  Congress controls funding; Congress refused to fund the closing of Gitmo.  With a budget of $0, Obama couldn't shut it down.

Maybe tomorrow I will look into exactly what the current wiretapping situation is, but for now I will say that Obama certainly deserves blame for some surveillance programs and certainly is the guy responsible for the drone assassinations.  However, things done by Congress tend to get blamed on Obama, so be careful before assuming that everything the US federal government does has Obama's approval.  Often his hand is forced or his will is overcome by the determined Republican opposition to everything he does.",0,1347438822,null,0,1347441765,0,c670xqw,t3_zq2nx,t1_c670xqw,t1_c66xzbc,null,1429879050,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

In October, there will be three debates between Romney and Obama.  Romney is already at a disadvantage because he is robotic and not very charming, and he didn't get a significant bump from his convention.

But beyond that, he has a major policy problem.

He has made income tax reform one of his priorities.  He's said that he would cut all income tax rates by 20%.  When asked how he would fund that major tax cut, he said that he would do so by closing tax loopholes and eliminating certain deductions, but without doing so in a way that would raise taxes for the middle class.  But here's the bitch of it: he refuses to say which loopholes or deductions he would eliminate.  He won't even speculate.  Independent analysts say that there is no way he could raise that much revenue without eliminating deductions cherished by middle class Americans, like the home mortgage deduction or the deduction of monies given to charity.  Now this problem has blown up in his face.  He and his Vice Presidential candidate were grilled about this tax ""plan"" on Sunday political talk shows.  They still refused to say anything about the specifics.  Now, even Republican pundits are jumping on them.  Obama will do the same in the debates.

Now, that construction would lead to less than 70 seats (according to the polls), so not functioning.

PvdA/VVD seems the most logical combination. They would only need 3 additional seats to gain a majority in parliament, which can be done by adding one of 7 parties.¹

However, it would be a good thing to speak French, maybe not being fluent, but at least being able to live without speaking English. We, French people, are very proud of our language, and we are often reluctant to speak English, especially when the person can speak at least a little French. 

As for the cost of studies, it depends where you study. You can study in State universities (the studies are free of charge for European citizens, but registering is not), but only a few of them are really good, and you have to fight very hard to get in, especially in Paris. Or you can go to what we call *Grandes écoles* (""Great Schools""), where you pay for your studies (the charge depends of which school you get in), but the teaching is at worst decent, at best excellent. 
The cost of life in Paris is very high, but is kinda okay outside the capital city. The real problem most people face in Paris is finding an accommodation, because the price is extremely expensive in the city center. You can still ask to live on the [State campus](http://www.ciup.fr/en), but only a few places are available. The best solution is to find a flat is the near suburbs, but be very careful because the transports reaching the suburbs may face some problems during the year. If want more informations about Paris, you should ask at [r/Paris](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paris/). 

I did a little research, and I found that one of the *Grandes écoles* of Computer Science in Paris offered [master degrees in English](http://www.epita.fr/masters/). They do not require any knowledge of French, but it is still a good idea to learn French, as I said. In the meantime, try to learn and practice a little bit, but once in Paris, you will find some classes for foreigners pretty easily.

So their share of the debt could be anywhere from £80-£180 billion, which is anywhere from 57%-128% of their GDP of £140 billion. Even the minimum, most generous partition is gonna cripple them, and they won't have London's resources to bail out their own banks if they become independent. Although if for whatever illogical reason the UK decides to not include liabilities and the bank bailouts in the debt partitioning then Scotland will be just barely on the border of violating the Maastricht Treaty's limits on debt (60% of GDP). If the UK partitions even a little of the liabilities and bank bailout costs to them then Scotland will be in violation of the Maastricht Treaty and any of the 27 members of the EU can use this as grounds to block Scotland from joining.

Just some points to get clear about unnemployed people in Spain:

1. Most of them are young people (less than 30) looking for their first jobs. More than 50%.

2. A lot of the lost jobs are in industrial production, other sectors have not been affected. Construction is severely affected.

3. Wages have lowered between 30-50% in technical jobs like architecture, engineering,... 

4. Tourism is the main economy sector as I see it here in Barcelona: waiters, tour guides, cooks... they still have their jobs. I work in graphic design and I even could leave a job and get a better one.

Most of my friends aren't working in their specialty but they all have jobs. Of course they're from here, catalans, and they speak both languages (spanish and catalan). In my group of friends we all have degrees and some had short periods of unnemployment but they could find another job in a few months, but they couldn't choose the sector.

About living here in Barcelona:

- 300€ for a room (plus internet, water, power... +30€).
- 120€ for food (cooking at home)
- 18-30€ for a dinner (1 person) - regular places
- 40€- (infinite) for a dinner
- We have 10-15€ menus, meaning 3 dishes, only for lunch, at most restaurants.
- Metro-bus-train card is about 50 € a month (10€ for 10 trips or 51€ a month for infinite trips).

I would save about 800€ per month you want to stay, plus whatever you want to study, buy or do.

As a waiter you could make 800-1200€ per month, working 7-10 hours a day (including weekends of course).",0,1347444746,null,0,false,0,c671fu0,t3_zqwtx,t1_c671fu0,t1_c670mz8,null,1429879293,2,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,2

***Draghi alone cannot save the euro***

**By Martin Wolf**


Last week’s decision by the European Central Bank to make unlimited purchases of government bonds in secondary markets was both necessary and bold. Mario Draghi, the ECB’s president, deserves credit for having obtained agreement for this controversial step, against the sole, albeit significant, opposition of Jens Weidmann, president of Germany’s redoubtable Bundesbank. It is a pity that the ECB did not do this before the crisis in sovereign debt reached Spain and Italy. Yet this delay is not surprising: eurozone policy makers have, perhaps inevitably, done too little, too late.


It is not the ECB’s fault that this action is too little. Its aim is to eliminate the risk of a eurozone breakup forced by the markets. But it cannot achieve this on its own. Ensuring the survival of the eurozone is a political decision. The ECB can only influence, not determine, the outcome.


The rationale offered for the programme of “Outright Monetary Transactions” is ingenious. The ECB insists that it does not aim to finance governments in difficulty. That, it insists, is a mere byproduct. At last week’s press conference, Mr Draghi stated that: “We aim to preserve the singleness of our monetary policy and to ensure the proper transmission of our policy stance to the real economy throughout the area. OMTs will enable us to address severe distortions in government bond markets which originate from, in particular, unfounded fears on the part of investors of the reversibility of the euro.” In making this case, Mr Draghi argued that “you have large parts of the euro area in what we call a ‘bad equilibrium’ ... So, there is a case for intervening ... to “break” these expectations, which ... do not concern only the specific countries, but the euro area as a whole. And this would justify the intervention of the central bank”. This then marks belated acceptance of strong arguments made by the Belgian economist, Paul de Grauwe, at the London School of Economics.


In its “Article IV” consultation with the eurozone, published in July, the staff of the International Monetary Fund argues that despite the low policy rates, credit conditions are extremely tight in some member countries. This, it argues, is due to divergent perceptions of the interlinked sovereign and banking risks, as well as a shrinkage in cross-border lending, as efforts are made to increase capital and liquidity buffers at home and place overnight deposits at the ECB. Today, in consequence, “financing conditions are the least supportive in countries where the crisis is the most acute.” This dire situation gives a strong rationale for the new policy. (See charts.)


Yet the ECB will not intervene unconditionally. It will, instead, intervene if and only if countries meet specific conditions. The precise conditions will not be set by the ECB. Mr Draghi said that it was up to the governments, the European Union, the European Commission and the IMF to decide on the precise nature of these conditions. But, once agreed, they would need to be respected. That is the ECB’s demand.


Such conditionality is perfectly understandable. But it must militate against the goals of the new programme. The ECB is saying that it will seek to eliminate the threat of a break-up, except when this threat is most real, which is. of course, precisely when the country is failing to meet policy conditions. Investors know that electorates might choose a government that has no intention of sticking to agreed conditions. What happens then? The answer is: either the ECB stops buying, in which case the bond market implodes, or the ECB continues, in which case conditionality is jettisoned.


This latter possibility seems the more likely: it will be hard for the ECB to stop. But that, too, might have dire consequences. Spurred on by opposition to this scheme from the Bundesbank, postwar Germany’s most respected institution, swathes of German opinion hate what is happening to their money, as my colleague, Wolfgang Munchau, explained a recent column. It is easy to imagine what would happen within Germany if an important member country started to backslide on agreed policy conditions, while the ECB went on buying its bonds. The swelling rage would hardly strengthen confidence in the irreversibility of the euro. Nobody could be sure how German politicians would choose to respond – or be allowed to respond. At present, the government is quite supportive of the ECB. But that would surely not endure under all circumstances.


In brief, a conditional programme of bond purchases, implemented against the opposition of the Bundesbank, just cannot make the eurozone credibly irreversible.


Is there any way the ECB on its own could make it more credible that the eurozone will last?


The answer is: yes and no.


Yes, if people believed membership of the eurozone were clearly in everyone’s interests, its survival would become far more credible. For that to happen, deficit countries need growth and jobs. The ECB could contribute by stepping harder on the monetary accelerator. After all, short-term economic prospects are dismal: the ECB forecasts real economic growth in the eurozone at -0.6 to -0.2 per cent this year and -0.4 to 1.4 per cent in 2013. By the second quarter of 2012, the eurozone’s nominal gross domestic product was a mere 3.4 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 2008.


Yet the answer is also, alas, “no”, because a more aggressive monetary policy would confirm German fears that the ECB was becoming the Banca d’Italia. The difficulty for the ECB is that relevant and appropriate measures are viewed, in Germany, as a giant step on the dismal path to hyperinflationary ruin. So long as this is the case, the ECB cannot make the euro look irreversible. That fact will undermine markets. That would force the ECB to buy more, so making the policy still less credible.


The ECB has done what it can, given the politics. The decision of the German constitutional court and the result of the Dutch election may help. But the risks of a breakup cannot be eliminated. If these are to disappear, citizens of debtor countries must see a credible path to growth, while citizens of creditor countries must believe they are not throwing money down a bottomless pit.

Heutzutage sind viele Sachverhalte zu kompliziert für einen Spruch auf einem Wahlplakat oder eine Bild-Homestory. Übrigens sind jetzt alle in der Bild. Und machen alle dort Homestories. Sogar Petra Pau hat vor so 10 Jahren mal eine gemacht (keine Ahnung, ob das damals Bild war) und hatte eine wahnsinnig spießige Inneneinrichtung in dunklem Massivholz. 

CSU und Linke haben übrigens mehr gemeinsam als FDP und CSU. Es heißt nicht umsonst S wie soziale Union. Beides sind auch regional Volksparteien. Eine in Bayern und eine in den neuen Bundesländern. Und was sie dort für Politik machen unterscheidet sich nicht großartig.

Ich wohne in Berlin. Wir hatten hier acht Jahre Rot-Rot und jetzt Rot-Schwarz. In der Politik macht das null Unterschied. Sind jetzt die berliner CDU und die Linke die selbe Partei? Nicht wirklich, aber sie haben große Überschneidungen. 

Es gibt keine Gesellschaftspläne mehr. Das beste Beispiel sind die Piraten und ihr neuer Vorstoß zum Urheberrecht, der nur marginale Änderungen an der aktuellen Gesetzeslage vorsieht. Kein großer Entwurf, keine radikale Kürzung der Schutzfrist. 

Wir sind angekommen in der kleinkarätigen Suche nach Details. Die Politik hat ihre Gestaltungsmacht längst aufgegeben. Ich schiebe das auf Faulheit. Warum etwas ändern, was funktioniert?

Déjà c'est sûr que c'est condescendant de dire ""province"", mais en même temps la centralisation existe bel et bien, et à quoi bon faire semblant du contraire en évitant certains mots. Moi j'utilise ce mot quand je veux dire ni Paris ni sa banlieue, eh oui (et là au passage hop, ""banlieue""...). Par contre si je vais à Lorient ou à Revel, je dis Bretagne ou Sud-Ouest (faut me dire si c'est condescendant), enfin du moins je crois.

Je suis d'accord avec ce que tu dis sur les grandes villes des US. J'en reviens tout juste et après les bus et le métro de San Francisco, de Seattle, et de façon générale la façon de gérer l'espace public de ces villes et d'autres lieux touristiques que j'ai pu visiter là-bas, ça m'a carrément oppressée de prendre le métro et de marcher à Châtelet ou Barbès. J'ai trouvé tout le monde agressif et chiant. Est-ce qu'on peut en tirer la conclusion qu'on est des cons ? Je sais pas. Peut-être qu'y a beaucoup moins de place ? Franchement j'en sais rien, mais c'est sûr qu'aux États-Unis c'est souvent plus étalé. Le métro de Paris est vieux, et les flux augmentent, c'est pas forcément facile à suivre niveau infrastructure. Je t'assure que prendre tous les jours le métro aux heures de pointe pour aller bosser ça rend psychotique, et là c'est d'autant plus vrai pour ceux qui habitent en banlieue pas proche (instant fugace de condescendance), parce que si tu rates ton rer à une nanoseconde et que le suivant est dans une demi-heure, c'est pas chouette. Parenthèse, 33 ans après je regarde toujours le plan du métro.

As euroskep mentioned above, some tax payers money was somehow used to produce this video, so you might as well get to watch it :D

As you already know, I'm a federalist myself.. but I have no problem with people being skeptics as a lot of you guys have some legitimate complaints regarding the EU. I personally believe that within the next few years we will get a federal europe through a new treaty and it will become more democratic. People will probably vote for it by a narrow margin.

Believe it or not, skeptics and federalists are both minorities in the big picture.. the main decision will be made by people who actually don't really care one way or another and will vote for what their favourite party tells them to vote for.

Information in the style of this video will be given to the average voter in easy sound bites and what it will come down to at the end of the day will be something along the lines of ""we are stronger together than alone"", and most people will just generally agree in most countries. If you looked up every single statement made in this video, there is probably *some* fact behind it. They can't just go around producing videos full of lies without being sued.

Surely there are many different ways of resolving the crisis, and the destruction of the euro may very well be a 'solution' as well. Each 'solution' also has consequences. Can anybody say without a doubt that if the various unions proposed at the end of this video were created.. that the crisis would still exist? Not really, they _are_ a legitimate solution.

Not the bailout money, apart from the one from the IMF and the EU. I don't care if the Eurozone countries want to transfer debt to their taxpayers.

[Link 3](http://www.transparency.ee/cm/files/2012_corruptionrisksineurope_en_0.pdf). Here is a report, from Transparency International. Again, you obviously do not have to read the whole thing, but I'll leave you with this quote from page two. 

""A number of countries in southern Europe – Greece,Italy, Portugal and Spain –are shown to have serious deficits in public sector accountability and deep-rooted problems of inefficiency, malpractice and corruption, which are neither sufficiently controlled nor sanctioned.""

Well, the evidence is that they have been on the receiving end for decades.

Since I brought them in as an example of long term wealth transfer with the aim of decreasing wealth disparity and encourage growth, which is exactly what we're talking about here whether you accept it or not.

&gt;I am not aware that Sweden joined up with Corsica

Firstly, Corsica is not a country, it is a region of France. Secondly, you should be rather embarrassed if you're not aware that Sweden joined with France, because it was done in 1995 when Sweden acceded. The Maastricht treaty was signed in '92 as well, so it's not even like you can claim you joined a different organisation (EEC, or ECSC, etc.)

&gt;or that the EU is a single country.

It's not, it's a supranational organisation for the time being.

&gt;Not the bailout money, apart from the one from the IMF and the EU. I don't care if the Eurozone countries want to transfer debt to their taxpayers. I think it's stupid and not really efficient the way it has been handled, but it is not my problem. The fact that EU money however is used for a not efficient bank save is my problem.

I'm sorry I don't fully understand what you're saying here, you appear to support the idea of bailouts but only within the eurozone, would that be accurate? In that case you do realise all the money was coming from national governments agreeing on a voluntary basis, right? The EU budget nothing compared to the bailouts and would never be sufficient to bail out a bank.

&gt;This is a study how organised crime misuse EU funds. That has particularely (as far as I've understood) been the case of southern Italy and Corsica. I am not asking you to read the report, it is a credible proof at least.

Sure, organised criminals defraud the EU, so what? Whats your point? They also defraud national governments, and since as that no doubt credible report states, the European Court of Auditors reports **3 cases** per year to the Anti-Fraud office. Something to work on? Sure, as it is for all governments, but an argument against the EU? Goodness no.

&gt;""A number of countries in southern Europe – Greece,Italy, Portugal and Spain –are shown to have serious deficits in public sector accountability and deep-rooted problems of inefficiency, malpractice and corruption, which are neither sufficiently controlled nor sanctioned.""

So here you have an actually valid point at last. But here's my retort:

We can work on that, we can help them improve, and moreover we *need* to help them improve because we *need* the EU if we want to maintain our wealth, maintain our security, and maintain our influence in the world. In short, it's worth putting up with having to help countries fix their corruption in order to maintain the EU.

&gt;Well, the evidence is that they have been on the receiving end for decades.

Again, you're simplifying and conflating. France has been on the receiving end of the CAP for decades, but that's intentional. Poland currently receives 6 billion euro a year, and Estonia was receiving **forty times** the amount that Spain was in 2009, the height of the recession.

To act like structural investment 15 years ago to build highways in Italy or Greece should have immediately gotten them to some imaginary point where they would be as productive as Denmark is just silly. The EU budget is tiny compared with national budgets, and any sort of investment, be it in agricultural subsidies (the majority of which go to France) or structural investment (the majority of which has generally and still is going to post-soviet countries), is not going to raise GDP growth to 10% just with the wave of a magic wand.

&gt;Why can't southern Italy be Estonia? Or Greece?

Because Italy and Greece as both highly developed countries, and Estonia wasn't in '91. Seriously, are you that unfamiliar with economics that you don't understand that it's far easier to increase growth rates with limited investment in developing or poorly developed countries than it is in highly developed countries?

Estonia does have (imo) better economic policy than say Italy or Greece, but that doesn't mean I'm going to say ""Oh well fuck it then"" - Italy and Spain are two very large, very powerful economies which generate huge amounts of wealth and are vital to the EU, a few reported occurrences of corruption in France or Italy and a slowly improving but nonetheless problematic tendency toward corruption and inefficiency shouldn't dent a much larger move toward a European federation.",0,1347464781,null,0,false,0,c674vyk,t3_zramr,t1_c674vyk,t1_c674fn8,null,1429880912,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Das war ja tatsächlich der Plan! Oder zumindest so ähnlich... Im Maunz/Dürig steht dazu:

&gt; 
Die Bezeichnung „Grundgesetz“ anstelle von „Verfassung“ kann je nach der geschichtlichen und politischen Verwendung gleichbedeutend mit „Verfassung“ sein. Sie kann auch gegenüber dem allgemeinen Begriff „Verfassung“ etwas Herausgehobenes bedeuten. Sie kann aber auch sagen wollen, daß sie gegenüber dem Begriff Verfassung eine gewisse Reserve zum Ausdruck bringt. Beim Grundgesetz der Bundesrepublik Deutschland darf angenommen werden, daß sich die Mehrheit der Mitglieder des Parlamentarischen Rates für die Bezeichnung „Grundgesetz“ entschieden haben, weil nach der damaligen Beurteilung der politischen Lage – insbesondere auch mit dem Blick auf die Sowjetunion – das beschlossene Gesetz nur für eine Übergangszeit bis zur Überwindung der deutschen Teilung Geltung haben sollte. Das kann in der Präambel auch zum Ausdruck. Daß die politische Entwicklung dann anders verlief, als in den ersten Nachkriegsjahren befürchtet, ändert nichts an der Vertretbarkeit der seinerzeitigen Einstellung. Als die Geltung des Grundgesetzes durch den Beitritt der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik auch auf deren Gebiet erstreckt wurde, wollte man offensichtlich an der inzwischen historisch gewordenen Bezeichnung nichts ändern. Es hätte so ausgesehen, als sollte nicht der bewährte Inhalt auf das beitretende Gebiet erstreckt, sondern etwas Neues Nichterprobtes an seine Stelle gesetzt werden. Wie auch sonst bei der Verfassung sind ohne Rücksicht auf die Bezeichnung „Grundgesetz“ bei seiner Änderung die Rechtsregeln über Verfassungsänderungen zu beachten.

Du siehst: Es geht (und ging) nur um den Namen! Das Ding war jedoch immer eine Verfassung. Wenn dich das Thema interessiert und du Student bist, schau doch mal bei dir in der Unibib vorbei und lies dich ein wenig in die GG Kommentare ein.

1. ""Schweinshaxe aka. Eisbein"" English may be ""pork knuckle"", I guess. If you boil it, it becomes an Eisbein (preferred in the north). Roast it to get a Schweinshaxe (that's how southerners like it).

2. Dumplings. They can be made out of potatoes, bread rolls, even pretzels. They do great as a side dish, or as main course e.g. with mushrooms.

3. Mashed potatoes. Works as a side dish with almost everything.

4. ""Eintopf"". I don't know how to translate, literally it means ""one pot"". And thats pretty much how it goes. One pot, fill with water, slice and put in what you have in your kitchen (carrots, potatoes, paprika, onions, tomatos, meat, etc), add a bit of salt and other herbs and spices, and boil it for some time. Voila.

5. Sauerkraut. Obviously. Goes very well e.g. with

true,TheMemo,null,null,"When I was a kid, I used to read books about the 'World of Tomorrow.' In these books, by the year 2000, we were supposed to be dedicating our lives to learning and expression while robots did all the work. At this point, every citizen could give up the time to research issues and make informed choices.

Of course, that hasn't happened and it's not because we lack the technology. The problem is that we love money, we love consumerism, we love capitalism, and all of those things require employment, no matter how meaningless or inefficient that employment is. Compared to the 50s or 60s, most jobs have the 'heavy lifting' performed by machine - be it a tool like a vacuum cleaner or a computer that collates and makes sense of data.

As a result, people are still deprived of the time and energy to be satisfactory citizens. In fact, due to forced increase in individual productivity without a commensurate increase in pay, the average worker has less time (but more access to information and opinion) to inform themselves and less of an overall share in the economic system.

As a result, any type of democracy is inherently flawed or unsuitable for modern living. Singapore or other technocracies are a more rational model and, unfortunately, will be inevitable. The pressures of capitalism have squeezed out the necessary prerequisites for a functioning democracy; free time, education and access to new ideas and experiences.

The last part is an important one, as our media and education systems have tended towards risk-averse behaviours which ensures that 'challenging' subjects or expressions are ignored. While the internet is, in part, challenging that approach, we have had several decades of, ultimately, cultural and educational stagnation. While I was in school, for instance, there was a lot of resistance to the idea of computers, programming (computer science) becoming a necessary subject in school and university. Even now, the nanotech sciences are considered 'risky' despite their potential to be a huge economic driver. The same goes for materials, robotics and replication technologies.

Ultimately, capital is averse to risk or novelty - certainly in Europe - and yet, novelty and risk are necessary for a culture to grow and societies to innovate and flourish. If we are to consider the concerns of capital to be paramount, then our societies must act more as machines that seek to maintain parity between the needs of a society working within the wider world and risk-averse behaviours. That cannot be accomplished through any democratic means, it requires a technocratic government that pushes a society in a necessary direction, keeping a firm hold of both the economic and cultural aspect. 

I return to Singapore, for a moment, as it is a good example. The singaporean government is one of the largest investors in singaporean businesses (through Temasek and GIC), and has control over all aspects of singaporean society by acting as both a corporation and a government. When changes are required, the system can take action in both fields. While, for the last few years (or decades), Singapore has been set up to deal with management industries, they are rapidly realising that there is a deficit with creative thinking and problem-solving which will put them at a disadvantage while the world transitions to an economy based on technological improvements (and, also, disruptive technologies). As a result, they are re-orienting their society towards creativity, arts, and other things that were considered luxuries just a few years ago. This is accomplished in record time because of the sheer level of control afforded by the de-facto one party system - the PAP, though even they are feeling the pressures of their electoral system. Suddenly, there are Art Colleges, franchises of Game Design Schools, satellite offices of companies like Industrial Light &amp; Magic, and a push towards sciences (including tax benefits for skunkworks and R&amp;D) and philosophy rather than management and business, in just a couple of years.

We can either have an unsatisfactory democratic system, where all are held hostage to the demands of capital and, thus, we are unable to effect any real change in the economic, cultural or technological spheres or we turn our societies into strongly controlled machines that are piloted by those who can make decisions unmolested by the vagaries of popular opinion. 

My perfect society, of course, would be the 'World of Tomorrow' in which work that demeans or fails to allow people to achieve their true potential is performed by machines with people able to dedicate their lives to personal and cultural enrichment. But, let's face it, that isn't going to happen. ",0,1347469225,null,0,false,0,c6762tf,t3_zramr,t1_c6762tf,t1_c674y83,null,1435684565,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Actually, this article tells mainly about 4-6 grades. After 3rd grade children have more teachers, one for every subject. In 1-3 grades they have one teacher for everything apart from music, P.E., arts, IT and religion. So if it was divided between 1-3 and 4-6 grades, 1-3 grades teachers would score higher, with an avarge 5 school hours per day (45 mins) and 4-6 teachers lower. But it's just my presumption.

b) With elementary teachers, I don't think they have to work a lot outside school. Most of homeworks are reviewed during lessons, only some of them are brought by teachers home, to check them. And in Poland teachers are not paid by a work hour. They get (since 1/9/2012):

* intern: 2 265 zł (555.13 euro)
* contract teacher: 2 331 zł (571.31 euro)
* appointed teacher: 2 647 zł (648.76 euro)
* diploma teacher: 3 109 zł (761.99 euro)

Those are diffrent stages in a teacher career, they don't make many sense but it's the way it was created years ago. And avarage pay in Poland is 833.31 euro. So on paper teachers earn a lot less but usually they also work as private tutors which sometimes can double their earnings (but usually they get maybe 25% more cash from tutoring).

The main problem is that teachers in Poland work only 186 days a year. So when you'll count how much they earn per a workhour/qorkday, they'd be well above the avarge pay.",0,1347471800,null,0,false,0,c676rkd,t3_zrczf,t1_c676rkd,t1_c672nhu,null,1429881797,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; Volgens De Wever worden de verkiezingen van 2014 beslissend. ""De match zal beslecht worden"", zegt hij. Ofwel winnen de Vlaamse partijen die de regering-Di Rupo hebben gesteund, ofwel de N-VA. ""Ik ben zeer optimistisch: dat zal N-VA zijn. (...) Op dat moment zullen we een echte discussie over het confederalisme hebben.""

&gt; De N-VA-voorzitter roept de Franstaligen op zich voor te bereiden. ""Ik denk dat het na de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen tijd is om te beginnen nadenken en in alle discretie samen te werken om het land voor te bereiden op deze grote verandering.""

&gt; Gisteren zei Brussels minister-president Charles Picqué (PS) nog dat de Franstaligen best een plan B zouden hebben voor als het land toch uiteen zou vallen.

In the next federal elections, the Flemish will have to decide whether to keep things the way they are, or move to _""confederalism""_.

Of course, this is all on paper, in reality splitting Belgium isn't that easy (what to do with Brussels; what to do with the Flemish towns that have a majority of French-speaking inhabitants; what to do with international decrees, etc.).

true,Vayl,null,null,"First, some context, before this friday there was a broad support to the austerity in the country, wether you liked or not, and would o stuff different, everyone more or less accepted it. After this friday this ended when the government announced something so stupid, it united the entire country against it, to give the prime example, Belmiro de Azevedo, the owner of the corporation studies says will gain more money with the meassure is frontally against it and says it makes no sense. So everyone is angry, really angry.

Now, the austerity is not a Portuguese invention, and the latest austerity this week is imposed by the Troika, IMF/EU/ECB. Wanting EU to save Portugal from austerity is simply silly as they are the ones claiming for even more.

The corruption, of course it exists like it does everywhere else, but the stuff he says makes no sense or logic. That ghost jobs are a huge problem, would like some source for that because never heard of it, there are a huge number of foundations and public institutes but they are being reduced (the PM should announce a list of closure tomorrow i think), people like to bash on foundations but the majority makes great work on social and cultural causes, but since they don't bring money, they think they are a waste.

Stuff like his boss making 20 to 30 times what he makes would mean his boss makes 14k to 28k/month, the maximum salary on public sector is 7k/month (equal to the prime minister) so it means he works on the private sector and how the hell the government or the Portuguese system has any say on that, corporation executives making piles of money is worldwide not Portugal related. 

His comments on the judicial system are also wrong when he says there is no idependence. Every government complains the judicial system is after them, even this year the constitutional tribunal gave a huge problem to the government when they refused part of the state budget. I commented more on this on another post in this thread.

The comments on the low educated people are again wrong, the public sector a higher percentage of educated people than the private one,  that's the reason that public sector wages are higher in average compared to private sector, because public workers have on average higher education. So if he is talking about public sector he is wrong, if he is talking about private sector, then is not a Portugal system of political problem, good luck trying to put a maximum salary for multi-national executives.

The reason highly educated persons are leaving, and is especially bad on health field is because there is no money to hire people, Portugal needs nurses, but is offering 2,9€/hour to nurses, no wonder all that can is migrating. The health minister had to make huge cuts on health, but again austerity is demanded by the EU, so....

To close, Portugal has many problems, the majors ones in my view are a devaluation of the President and the party system that is clearly not working. The austerity the PM announced this friday is stupid because it is not needed and will not be used to pay the debt or balance the budget but will instead go straight to the big bussiness vaults, and made everyone extremely angry and now basically just unloading venom about everything.

* poverty

On the central government I would say the major corruption period was around the early to mid 90's, while the PM is not suspect (it's the current president and while seen has ineffective no one would call him corrupt), the people he sorrounded himself with (you can google Dias Loureiro e Duarte Lima to have a idea) are extremely shady, This was the period where there was a democracy for little more than 10 years and the EU money started to enter in massive amounts, so attracted people that wanted to get rich to the politics.

More recently, there are two cases, the German submarines that are a huge clusterfuck and still being investigated and Socrates, he was the last PM, and one of the major responsables of this entire mess, but not the one like many want to beleive (Barroso has a lot of blame in Portugal situation, so please don't let him come back from the EU), and he is seen as corrupt, for now is only perception, since he was under heavy investigation but nothing was found, this colors the corruption view of most people, since if you ask anyone in the street everyone will say Socrates is a corrupt dirtbag.

First, the meassure most people are angry about is the increase from 12% to 18% of the payment to social security, this will roughly amount from one to 1,6 liquid salary lost over one year (Portuguese get the annual salary divided by 14 instead of 12). This money saved is not going to pay back anything, because the Business will have a deacrease on the amount they pay to reduce labour costs, so the Social security will receive roughly the same, and is a direct wealth transfer from workers to bussiness, even the Bussiness associations are against this because they will lose a lot more money since with a huge purchasing power reduction no one will buy their stuff. Again, is making the worker poorer for social experimentation, it will not pay anything to anyone.

Second I would ask what ghost jobs?

?

If you're asking about Basque separatists it's a different kettle.  If you're referencing their ascension - different kettle of fish again.  Scotland can make most EU countries blush and it's not like there'd be Yes referendum result and then it happens the next Tuesday.

If it's that Spain will try to ruin their ascension chances, I wouldn't worry about that one too much.   There's already been some retraction and it's not like they're in a strong position to start going against the grain.

&gt;We're already paying back the debt though, just as part of the UK. 

With shared infrastructure debt interest repayments are being met, debt isn't being paid off though.  That and 90% of the oilfields that Scotland wants to claim also pays into the UK.  If it takes the oilfields and it takes a share of the debt it just so happens the two are comparable.  There's not a whole lot left.  That's not to say that Scotland can't afford to go down the independence route, it can, but people aren't being honest about the figures.  Oil can't close the deficit, pay off the interest on the debt, pay for independence, be used as a collateral on a currency, and be used to reinvest in Scottish infrastructure, business and provide the corporation cuts Salmond has promised.  One must be chosen, at best one and a half, and then other means found to provide the others.

&gt;The SNP would hold power but for how long? I wouldn't be surprised if Labour or the Lib Dems took significant power fairly rapidly.

Are any of them advocating a new currency?  That in itself is still going to take a long time so it is going to be the BoE running the currency for some time to come only they won't be thinking about what is in the interest of an independent Scotland.  They'll be duty bound to think what is best for those still in the union.

 Yeah, sorry, I put in a little ninja edit when I realised that's what you were probably referring to.  Again, I wouldn't worry about that too much and they're not in a strong position to start going against the main crowd and economic distinctions can be met.

Scotland is more developed than many of the existing members.

The idea of a uniquely Scottish currency doesn't seem to be being trumpeted by anyone.  Economically the situation isn't there at the moment.   Certainly the SNP are pushing it so if the work isn't being done now or in the near future it's still 10 years off.  A decade of BoE setting the interest rates.

Think of it as a guy psyching himself up for a fight. The more people see Islam as something that might require a Final Solution (very intentionally used) in Europe, the more they psych themselves up not to see Muslims as humans.

I have no doubt that most people would LOVE to see the situation defused, but lets be real here - I suspect a majority of Europeans would get rid of every Muslim in Europe rather than suffer Sharia in Europe. If you're on the fence about that, I suggest having a daughter - you'll be ready to do some fairly horrible things to prevent them from being dropped to a second grade citizen.

Lol. The U.S. pioneered railroads, electrical grids, the automobile, etc.

You missed the part where I said I agreed with you that Americans should have adequate social welfare programs. I'm not for ""privatized small government"" or anything of the sort. My argument is that until the U.S. loses a couple hundred million citizens, there is no way that any social welfare programs will work properly for the entire population. At the very least, we would need to lose the 12 million illegal non-tax-paying leeches which are currently using every possible social service available. Next, there'd have to be greater autonomy granted at the state level to manage these programs, as it is simply too big of a job for the federal government. I'm not saying we shouldn't invest in infrastructure and social protections. Of course we should! Defense spending should go down, Medicaid and Medicare spending should go up. That's obvious. All I was saying, and quite reasonably in my opinion, that the Nordic style social welfare model (which, by default, is based on populations of only a few million) is not feasible here, in any way I can imagine.

Don't get me wrong. I really want to see a prosperous Europe and I am in no way against the countries of Europe (and in the long run the world) uniting under one flag but we need to go that path together. Only when we, the people, feel as one can we be one.

We have to deal with the world as it is, rather than how we want it to be. If you accept the former, the more control you have over the latter.

An example would be American policy toward China in the 1970s. Nixon and Kissinger were realists, they didn't like the fact that the People's Republic of China controlled the mainland, and much preferred the Republic of China. But they understood that the PRC was here to stay, and they pursued a policy that brought China out of its self isolation and on the path to becoming an integral part of global politics and economics. The conservative firebrands in the Republican party at the time (such as Reagan and William F. Buckley) hated that Nixon essentially abandoned the Republic of China and pursued a new relationship with the PRC.

Similarly, the EU is here to stay. Sure, technically it is possible to dissolve it, but there isn't a large enough desire to, nor any real reason to other than residual nationalist sentiment.

&gt;This is certainly the viewpoint of the pro-EU world.

No, this is fact. The UK is a country of 62 million people that is intent on retaining its status as an influential global player.

Motorcycles/scooters/bikers don't like waiting in lines.  See my comments above.  In the 18 months I've been here, I've never once seen an accident involving a two wheeled vehicle.  Most Italians are extremely aware of their surroundings and make room for non-cagers.

true,bunburya,IREL,Hibernia,"&gt; The discussion I want to have is this: even if you are pro-european how is this not overt Orwellian political propoganda? 

Why don't you explain why you think it *is* Orwellian? Where is the doublespeak, the imprisonment, the censorship, the torture?

&gt; Surely even if you agree the analysis of the crisis as spreading from the USA, and not from the flaws in a suboptimal currency zone and overspending in contradiction to the growth and stability pact, you will concede that this is contested issue.

- Considering that non-eurozone countries, most notably the US, have also been hit hard by the crisis, it seems inaccurate to say that the EMU is the sole or even the main cause of the crisis.

- If the the currency zone is suboptimal, it is precisely because of a lack of banking, economic and banking unions. The video calls for these things to be implemented. So the point is rather moot, because even if the euro was a substantial cause of the crisis, the video calls for actions that will help to ensure that it does not cause a crisis again.

&gt; Surely even if you think the banking supervision by the EU is a good thing, you will agree that there is another position that says it is not.

I also agree that gay marriage is a good thing, but I know that many do not. That doesn't mean I don't want the EU and/or my government to take a stance (namely, my stance) on the issue.

&gt;  So even if my positions are totally wrong in your view and this video extolling the other side is right, is it not an inappropriate place to be making the argument? Is it not inappropriate for the commission to be paying people out of my taxes for this? Inapropriate for a civil servant, a graphic designer in this case, to be expensively visualising a red crisis spreading from the USA across the globe, and using software to add positive soundtracks to Barroso's point of view?

I don't see how it's unreasonable for the Commission to be taking a position like this. The institutions of the EU are committed by the Treaties to work towards an ever closer union. We knew this when we joined. Banking and economic unions are the only way to safeguard against future crises while keeping the EU and its goal of cohesion intact.

&gt; Can someone tell me why I am, as a skeptic, paying for this from my taxes?

True, but no country is doing well actually, apart from Sweden, Poland and Norway. Hungary et al are doing the way that can be expected. (And, I can tell you that Sweden is pretty surprised, we calculated with a lot worse), Poland - great. Norway -oil (sigh). You are right about the UK though.

&gt;Whether you're part of the eurozone seems to actually be irrelevant. What matters is how quickly and decisively you can act. And that's why...

That is sort of true (and I mean that you are correct, but there are other things to factor in as well). I mean, if you are a part of the Eurozone, you can not act decisivly, in a way that matters to your region, whatever it might be. Also, which is a very big factor, you might end up being in debt for other countries. For example, Finland. If you compare Finland to Sweden (which are pretty similar) we had an equal growth when Finland were in/Sweden were outside of the Euro. Now, Sweden is still growing, while Finland is cutting down on social services/pensions and borrowing more, while at the same time paying towards southern Europe.

To top that off, Draghi promised *unlimited* support, so, the Finns can't even calculate how much they will spend, it depends on southern Europe. 

Sweden, on the other hand (by no means perfect, I'd just like to state that), have a really strong economy that we can rely on. We have an independent national bank (modelled after the former Bundesbank actualy) so our politicians can't rely on it, but what they do know, is that it will defend our monetary policy. The Finns can not trust that. 

I guess what I am trying to say that I am a sucspicious person in general, and I hardly trust the Swedish politicians with *my* tax money, even though their track record is OK. Brussels is worse, and southern Europe........

I'm not. The EU is far from perfect. The CAP issue is actually a very interesting point. While the EU defines very clear rules to allocate funds, it lacks the power to actually control and correct misuses. Banking and fiscal supervision is a very good example of that. Even though they were rules already in places and they have been strengthen recently, the EU can never do better than what its member states allow it to do.

Well, first of all, it's not Sweden alone. Another member states are on the same page. And European politics has always been about building alliances between member states on a case by case basis. Of course, if you're not playing, you can't win (that's the main argument for more involvement of eurosceptics). There is now a huge consensus which did not exist before for more serious fiscal and economical policies.

&gt; We have already lost. I keep on asking where our money has gone to, since 1995, but I never receive an answer.

We didn't manage to change that - but you are claimin that we will change the whole of the EU. Sorry, that is to naive, we will not. The best we can do is cling to ourselves, and to other non- corrupt countries.

So Sweden should leave. But it doesn't. When Sweden decided to join, it was already a rather richer state compared to other member state. Still, it decided to join. I don't know Sweden enough to speculate about the motives but it must have found a benefit in it. Nobody forced it. As a matter of fact, it easily found a loop hole to avoid the obligation of adopting the euro which tend to prove that it cannot be forced into doing something it opposes because of its own interest.

I like to think it's like a nuclear deterrent. Just showing that you can do it and threatening to do it should actually help you not using it. As soon as markets understand that there's a real will from member states not to let the euro (and even the European Union) unwind, they should start acting a little bit less threatening and irrational (having ratings of some european states as bad as third world countries is getting ridiculous), just enough for structural reforms to start having a real effect.

There's also now a real incentive for everyone to get better since if member states start actually default on their debts, the ECB will end up with losses exceeding its capital. It will then have to be recapitalized by  eurozone members (it's in the treaties). And that will pretty much be the then of any european integration projects for at least a few decades.

How? Honestly, I am not trying to be smart, I am just trying to figure out how me how. People were saying the same thing before the Euro, and that didn't work.

I am a scientist (who has studied some economics, so I do have a basic understanding). There has to be calculations for this. Otherwise - we are aleady in the EU, so we are already *in*. It is not like German companies are not doing deal with us because we are Swedish. I am not trying to be smart - do you have any numbers for this statement? 

&gt;The CAP issue is actually a very interesting point. While the EU defines very clear rules to allocate funds, it lacks the power to actually control and correct misuses.

In the case of the CAP, it falls to member state to ensure funds are correctly used. In one of your link, one of the biggest offender seems to be the UK.

And, that is very, very annoying to Sweden. Since we (and other Nordic states) actually complies with the rules, whether is money allocated to Sweden or to another country, you follow the rules ( I lived with this firsthand when my cousin was receiving money from the EU...They authorithies did several unannounced visits, just to see that the 100 000 SEK (€12 000) were not misused..). I'd say that we use the money better actually, and I am getting tired handing them over to the EU. Can't the EU, or the countries use them well, we might as well keep them? Me complaining might matter to no one, but this is the general feeling up here. That is a problem, and Barroso saying that we need more federation, the EU trying to increase the budget, and a close union....Frankly, I am wondering if they are trying to get us to dislike them. Why not solve some of the problems first? If they can't solve the first, I hardly believe they are going to solve the second with integration... 

Also, I think the UK and France is an offender of misuse of CAP money, not as much of straight corruption/mafia (perhaps southern France). The thing is, the EU has to solve this somehow, and they have to do this without dragging us down in the mud. I do not want to give money to someone where it is not well used. It is rather simple.

The two main actors (Flemish/Walloons) in this minor drama have a *huge* love-hate relationship in that they sometimes hate each other's guts yet at the same time, the vast majority couldn't bear living apart from each other either.

Reminds me of an octogenarian couple celebrating their 70^th anniversary, bickering about the cake and seating arrangements.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I like to think it's like a nuclear deterrent. Just showing that you can do it and threatening to do it should actually help you not using it. 

In the best of worlds, that will be true. It is more likely (like someone posted today, an article by Marcus Wolf)that the countrie will not follow, and the ECB will keep on buying anyway and the transfers will be permanent. 

&gt;As soon as markets understand that there's a real will from member states not to let the euro (and even the European Union) unwind, they should start acting a little bit less threatening and irrational (having ratings of some european states as bad as third world countries is getting ridiculous), just enough for structural reforms to start having a real effect.

Half of the problem is, that if I was the market (well I am, but a miniscule part), I'd never invest in southern Europe. Sorry, I wouldn't. Not because I hate southern Europeans, but because they are not competitive, not cheap enough, and a bit to corrupt for my liking (in general, do not kill me southern Europeans, you are nice individuals(. I mean, I am comparing to Turkey, Vietnam or other cheap countries -or, to expensive ones like the Netherlands. 

It can and will happen, but it will take years, decades. And during that time, money will be transferred....

&gt;There's also now a real incentive for everyone to get better since if member states start actually default on their debts, the ECB will end up with losses exceeding its capital. It will then have to be recapitalized by eurozone members (it's in the treaties). And that will pretty much be the then of any european integration projects for at least a few decades.

Frankly, I am sorry, I do not believe this. If Greece and Italy cared about any rules, they wouldn't have gotten in the first place. They are hardly going to care about what it cost Finnish taxpayers. 

&gt;That will be rather painful for everyone. So please, excuse me if I indulge in a bit of optimism sometimes. The alternatives are getting frightening.

That I can understand. I am very frightened, I am am Swedish, we have an OK economy, low debt etc, and sometimes I can't sleep. ....

What people fail to see is that by using violent and slanderous tactics, you de-legitimise your own argument against the incursion of Islam.

We have to think why we don't like Islam. For me, it is the way they treat their women (and all women) and their endemic racism against Jews and to a lesser extent other races. If Islam fixed these issues, and became as benign as say: The Catholic Church, I would not really have a problem with it.

I say this because the Catholic Church *was* just about the most vile institution you could think of. I dont need to go in to the history of it. But what we see today is a largely progressive (considering it's *the* Christian Church) Church which organises massive aid programs, promotes Gender equality, condemns violence, and makes massive contributions to science and history (The vatican archives).

To me, the bigger difference means that more work and thought goes into the integration (not assimilation) process. But still, there's no fundamental difference.

Belgium is a total loss in my opinion. I'm not looking forward to separation but I'm also not looking forward to keeping the Belgium system alive much longer.

Separation is not desirable for at least two reasons:

* francophone politicians will screw over Flemish people royally in case of separation. They will continue with Belgium (hence keep the EU membership for example), they will claim and probably get Brussels, yet at the same time they will offload most of the debt to Flanders. And that would be the start.

* the current Flemish political system isn't desirable either. There are way too many bureaucrats hence way too much bureaucracy. The Flemish political system is a copy of the Belgium political system and is in dire need of reform. This reform is very unlikely to happen in case of separation. (sidenote: the EU political system is in a much worse condition in my opinion)

Continuing with Belgium isn't desirable either for many reasons:

* Belgium actually consists of a couple of democracies tangled together into a crazy federal quagmire. It's for example difficult determine the actual number of democracies. I will spare you the details but the consequence is that it becomes nearly impossible for voters and politicians to get anything done. Everything has a price, sometimes Flemish people pay way too much, sometimes francophone people pay way too much. It is nearly impossible to reach a balance that can be satisfactory to most people for even a few years.

* You can't keep reforming and reforming a political system of a nation-state. There need to be periods of stability. Each time there are elections the political system itself causes so much friction and agitation (both in people that do and do not want to change it.) Changing a political system requires much more effort and energy than deciding on and executing actual policies. This renders the Belgium political system into a painful, slow process where very little can be achieved.

* Because the political system itself is powerless - nothing can get done anyways - power shifts elsewhere: political parties, unions, the actual government, ... . All these people realize the normal democratic process is too slow and too painful, hence decisions are made that will most likely not hurt the people in power too much. I'm not sure how to convey this but this diplomatic adage is true in Belgium: if you're not at the table you're on the menu.

Don't have more time to finish this comment, hope this helps.

edit: some examples from the most recent federal budget that demonstrate that if you're not at the table you're on the menu:

* all subsidies for well-isolated houses have been slashed. Why? a) because the green party wasn't at the table, b) because the parties at the table realized that if they wouldn't push this through one of their *holy houses* would be next. Neither the green party nor the construction industry were at the table so they were on the menu. When the construction industry complained the federal government's reply was that housing was a responsibility of the regions - which is probably correct - and that they should thus knock on the region's door. Of course the regions don't have that kind of money - also because the subsidies were slashed but the freed budget was not transferred to the regions. This is just one example of how the crazy and often illogical distribution of responsibilities between the many political entities is used as an excuse to not do anything.

* taxation on company cars was altered. The unions were represented at the table via the various parties. However, the unions have been against company cars since many years. So although the interests of the people affected by this new taxation should have been protected by the unions the unions didn't care about these people enough, especially because they realized that if they wouldn't accept this more worrisome proposals might have surfaced.

* a counter example: the automatic indexation of salaries for employees in the private sector is simply not open for discussion because it's the holy cow of the socialist parties and the unions, yet discussions on a wealth tax resurface from time to time although the liberal parties in the federal government oppose it.",0,1347520692,null,0,1347536807,0,c67ia22,t3_zs9x6,t1_c67ia22,t3_zs9x6,null,1429887357,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

Rather they want a more confederal way of governing things. They are upset at deals like BHV because they feel they need to give to much away to get more selfdetermination. As far as i know only few (without any political party representing them) want to join the Netherlands. 

Walloons (the ones i know) look more indifferent at the flemish seperatists.  Thinking that the split of Belgium will never happen and seeing it as a potential disaster that will deter their fellow country men. 

This is all leads to a political stalemate that criples the country. A minor but highly symbolical issue like BHV(something insignificant on the whole of belgium) is allowed to dominate politics for a decade. And this is the real cost of the seperatism.

true,Delheru,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Jesus, I wonder how humans keep making this mistake. This is how bad sectarianism starts. It escalates and escalates until people start to get killed. A lot.

Technically it isn't a mistake if you're on the winning side. It's even very efficient, but it's - like all such things - nearly impossible to control. Even if Islam did a complete about-face 5 years down that road, stopping the train would be close to impossible.

&gt; What people fail to see is that by using violent and slanderous tactics, you de-legitimise your own argument against the incursion of Islam.

Think of the society as a spectrum. The ""rabble"" is beginning to psych itself up while the educated segments of society are still trying to sort it out.

This works in a way. The working up of said rabble puts time pressure on the elites to sort something out. It also gives them a plan B in case nothing really works.

I personally dislike all organized religion, but find Islam the worst of the crop currently. The treatment of women. Bringing their sky wizard to the public sphere (don't worry, I despite American born-again Christians for the exact same thing). Miserable levels of cultural development in many of the core areas like Saudi-Arabia (others like Iran are quite advanced though, and boast remarkable histories). And yea, I just called them barbarians in a rather snootier way.

Islam needs a reformation and it needs it badly. I suspect external pressure (EU/US standing firm on things like freedom of speech) combined with internal pressure (people with access to the internet) will have the best shot of succeeding. As long as the fundamentalists can claim this narrative where their victory is inevitable, it'll be very hard to shut the whole thing down. Right now they have a very credible narrative where they are driving the West both economically and morally bankrupt with very little effort. This needs to get stopped by showing them just how incredibly insignificant they are: scale down spending on the war(s) and ignore any and all ranting they might do based on pictures of Mohammed.

true,ajuc,POLA,Poland,"In Poland electronic boards nonsense is because of EU funds. School can get money for such things easily, so it buys them, even if nobody knows what to do with it afterwards.

My wife taught math and computer science in a few middle schools, and computers weren't a problem. Photocopiers were there also, but in one school you had to pay for using it (because it was also accessible for students, and without price kids would just copy their bottoms all the time :) ). It was small amount, less than 0.10 euro, but still ,when copying sth for 4 classes of 30 pupils it quickly adds up.

I think the biggest problem in Polish schools is not equipment, but attitude of most students and teachers. Teachers earn badly, but work few hours (including homework) and have free vacations, so the laziest people are the most likely to be a teacher. So many teachers slack off - just do the moves but don't care if anybody understand, etc. And those that do care are pain in the ass for both lazy teachers and pupils, so they are ""temepred down"" or they go to work somewhere else.

Of course it depends highly on the kind of school you work in. I'd say 30% schools are just ""push the kid to the next class"". And sth like 10% are very good schools, it's self-powering circle - only best kids and teachers go to these schools. The rest are somewhere in the middle, but with less kids because of demographics I think many schools will need to admit less well prepared kids, and the level of education will accordingly go down in many of the average schools.",0,1347534859,null,0,false,0,c67jm4c,t3_zrczf,t1_c67jm4c,t1_c67ivzw,null,1429887986,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

There's a lot more rhetoric that I could dig up, as well. It's inevitable that public support for FN will seep through to the government to some degree.

&gt; Davyth Hicks, chief of Eurolang, a Brussels-based NGO that forms part of the European Language Equality Network (ELEN), said that France was one of only a handful of states in Europe not to have ratified the [European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages], which is considered the key legislation protecting and promoting linguistic diversity across the continent.

&gt; While neighbours such as the UK and Spain grant co-official status to languages such as Welsh, Basque, Catalan and Galician, Hicks said France remained a ""pariah"".

&gt; ""France is a rogue state in terms of how it promotes its languages. It just has not kept up with European development. It says all these things about the promotion of human rights and equality elsewhere in the world, but meanwhile, on its doorstep, languages such as Breton have become seriously endangered,"" Hicks said.

Edit: Added a sentence or two. Also, to clarify, I'm not saying that France is some dreadful nationalistic, authoritarian state, or that Britain is perfect.

Also, I refine it even a little further, as I think (from context) that this poem is ""coming from your Oma"" and is directed to the guests at the funeral, right? This means your Oma is talking not to one person, but to several, this is why a few words have to be changed here and there (If not, inform me and I will make it singular again):

    Weinet nicht um meinetwegen,
    Da bin ich heute gegen.
    Seid stark für mich und lächelt,
    Wir sitzen nach einer Weile wieder beisamen in der Paradieswelt.
    Ich weiß ihr vermisst mich,
    Doch mein neues zu Hause ist auch sehr ansehlich.
    Setzt nicht länger euren Kummer fort,
    Ich bin jetzt an einem viel sorgloserem Ort.
    Lasset nicht eure Tränen hinunterzischen,
    Denn ich schaffe es leider nicht mehr sie euch wegzuwischen.
    Ja, mein Leben war nicht sehr lang,
    Doch für euch geht es immer noch voran.
    Lebet jeden Moment als wäre es euer letzter,
    Ich habe viele Erinnerungen und keine davon ist ersetzbar.
    Erfreut euch am Leben und an der Liebe, während ich euch von oben beobachte.
    Als ich an all die schönen Dinge zurückdacht',
    entdeckte ich plötzlich meine neue Flügelpracht.
    Die Zeit für mich loszufliegen ist gekommen,
    Meine neue Aufgabe als euer Schutzengel habe ich gerne entgegengenommen.
    Um mich zu weinen braucht ihr wirklich nicht,
    Ich bin bereits auf dem Weg ins Licht.
    Auf dem Weg gen Himmel erkannt' ich die Moral,
    Es heißt nun ""Lebt wohl"", und das zum allerletzten mal.



I cried a little.

I changed ""I am in a much better place"" to ""I am in a much more carefree place"". Reason is because I think non-believers would prefer that over the original. Im not against religion or anything. It's just because you see, as an atheist I would think ""what, didn't you like it here with us, Oma? Was it that bad that you call your new place **much** better, though many of your loved ones are not there? Pf."" I hope you dont mind. If you do, change ""sorgloserem"" to ""besserem"".

true,OparinOcean001,null,null,"Romney is well-known for drastically changing his position on nearly every issue, from the time he was running for the US Senate and Governor of Massachusetts, when he espoused reasonably centrist views, to now, as he has shifted very far to the right in an attempt to appease his base. He's also managed to go back and forth on a number of issues just within the span of the last few months, depending on what audience he happens to be speaking to at the time. [Here](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/may/18/politifacts-guide-mitt-romneys-flip-flops/) are a few examples, just to give you an idea. For more detail, you can read the [Political positions of Mitt Romney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Mitt_Romney) wikipedia page, where you'll find a good amount of documentation on Romney's shifts over the years.

Basically, he has the reputation for not having much of a backbone or any personal convictions on anything. Of course, a lot of the criticism hurled at these candidates is just politics, but for Romney I think this is by far his most legitimately worrying quality. Since he would be representing a party that's becoming more and more extreme over the course of the last decade, I don't see much indication that he would serve as a mitigating factor to his base. A lot of people (myself included) hoped that Obama's election was a symbol of the American people resolving to move away from Bush-era policies. But why would it be? The roughly 30-40% of the population who supported Bush all throughout his presidency have not gone away.

In terms of foreign policy, which would be most relevant to Europe: Having only served as a state governor, Mitt Romney essentially has no foreign policy experience, so it's hard to say exactly what he'd do. But if the possibility of a Bush 2.0 doesn't appeal to you, I'd be concerned by his repeated statements on how Obama only ever ""apologizes"" for US power and influence. See: [Romney's response to the US diplomatic missions attacks in Libya](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/fact-checkers-say-no-to-romney-apology-claims/2012/09/13/7d88a03e-fd3a-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_blog.html):

&gt;Romney has falsely accused Obama of “apologizing for America” many times before. The line has been a dependable applause-getter with conservative audiences. But we found no basis for this claim in Obama’s previous speeches and remarks. And other fact-checkers came to similar conclusions.

I could ask for proof, but that implication is wrong anyway since there are so many kinds of chocolate from both manufacturers. And well, Milka produced the most popular varieties. There are so many other brands that have a wider variety.

&gt; Because that company is why people aound the world can enjoy chocolate at prices somewhere below kings' ransoms?

I consider chocolate to be really cheap in Germany. I also don't see the big price difference. And i guess ""around the world"" includes Germany.

&gt;""Hershey process"" milk chocolate is popular in North America. It was invented by Milton S. Hershey, founder of The Hershey Company, and can be produced more cheaply than other processes since it is less sensitive to the freshness of the milk. The process is a trade secret, but experts speculate that the milk is partially lipolyzed, producing butyric acid, which stabilizes the milk from further fermentation. This compound gives the product a particular sour, ""tangy"" taste, to which the American public has become accustomed, to the point that other manufacturers now simply add butyric acid to their milk chocolates.

These seemingly modern ways of thinking,goo such as public healthcare, and public education are VERY offensive to most older(and definately conservative) Americans. It is very medieval the way our politics work and how people see social reform. Europe went thru its Liberal revolution in the 1800's and I feel its springing up here soon. Young people like me who cannot afford university see all this news from Europe about 400 euro a semsester payments for university. 400USD may cover a law students textbook.

I dont expect you guys to really watch our elections(its extremely painful for me to watch even) but our whole republican ideal seems to be defending ""what our founding fathers stood for."" I don't think these people think logically about what they say. What do I have in common with men from the 18th century, wearing powdered wigs all happy about being free from British rule? Nothing. There is very little progress with our countries politics because of one document that people hold more sacred than anything else, the US Constitution.

true,TheActualAWdeV,FRIE,Fryslân/Bilkert,"Oh that makes sense. The x-axis (horizontal) depicts left - right and the y-axis progressive - conservative.

The images move from light grey to dark grey to coloured to show their changes.

Furthest to the left, the big red ""SP"" with the heart (actually a tomato but doesn't look like it at this size) is the ""Socialistische partij"". The socialist party, obviously.  They're socialist (duh) and vocally anti-european union. (not actually anti-europe, that's daft)

Starting equally to the left but more progressively (higher up) is GroenLinks (Greenleft). They're the green party, also socialist. I don't know about their stance on the EU but they're not as noisily against as the PVV or SP so I assume they're pro. They've moved significantly to the right (but I don't know how or why) and are slightly more progressive now too.

Below the second step of Groenlinks you see a confusing smudge. That's the result of a far too detailed logo compressed to this level and then put, in triplicate, on top of each other. That's the PvdD (Partij van de Dieren), the party of the animals. Socialist, pro-animal rights.

Nearby you can see the purple white 50 PLUS logo. It's for the 50+ party, a party for the elderly. They campaign for everyone else to git offa their dang lawns. Or more accurately, they're (as far as I know) fairly one-issue and that's to do with the pensions and their retirements. I should look this up but I assume they're against lowering pensions and raising the retirement ago. They weren't around (or haven't moved since) in the last election and so only show up once.

Between the last position of GroenLinks and the 50+ is the PvdA. (Partij van de Arbeid). Labour party. They got a close second place in the elections and they're pro-europe socialists. IIRC they want to invest in education and healthcare and such.

On the intersection between left and right in progressive land you can see the first position of D66. Democrats '66 (founded in 1966). I honestly can't tell you anything about them but they moved further to the right and became more progressive. Whatever that means.

On the intersection between Progressive and conservative on the left-right bar halfway to the right, you can see the starting position of VVD. (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie, VVD) The People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, they're the liberals. Very much free-market liberals with some peculiarities (opposed to marijuana legislation, which (to me) is governmental meddling in both economic liberty and private citizens). They're the winners (with a small difference) this election. I looked them up with wikipedia and do agree with some of their things but they also insist on giving everybody a 1000 euro tax decrease which seems silly to me as well as being opposed to giving aid to other countries. Not so much emergency earthquake stuff but the other long-term things. I can't think of the proper word.

The bird is the PVV, they're the anti-EU party par excellence and are anti-islam, anti-immigration. I don't like them but you could look them up, I'm sure you've heard of them. :D

The green letters ""CDA"" are the Christian Democratic Appeal although they seem to be vaguely confessional these days, with some muslim members. They're generally considered centre but they're further to the right than the PVV in this chart.

The CU you see there is the Christian Union which is a more hardline christian version of the CDA.

And the SGP is the absolute most hardcore biblemongering party around. They're not very popular except for some very specific areas in the country. Their ""lijsttrekker"" (list puller, most important candidate) made some stupid remarks about abortions and rapes (in the same vein as Todd Akin in the USA, believing there's a natural mechanism against conceiving after rape). 

I hope this helps. I did not know much about the party points specifically but I could atleast give you the names. :D

true,EuroTreasure,NORW,Norway,"In Norway, the goverment runs 99% of the airports in the country thorugh a govermental company called Avinor. Avinor basically sucks money out of the airports that have alot of traffic, to subsidize rural airports. This is all well and good, but when a private company wanted to build a new airport on an old military airport some 50min outside of Oslo, the government did all in its power to stop this as it would disrupt the way it’s structured now, even though Oslo Gardemoen, the main airport, is nearing max capacity.  I think this is an extremely backward approach and principally wrong. So did the EU with its Bolkestein-directive.


Postal delivery in Norway is basically operated by one company, the governmentally owned BRING (see a pattern here?). BRING has grown by expanding into the Swedish market and taking shares away from the Swedish postal service. Competition is good right? No, while the Norwegian government wants to earn money in the Swedish market, they do not want any other countries to compete against their BRING. Luckily there is the Postal-directive which the Norwegian government is fighting right now, but in the end, it will succumb. 


The EU is so big and encompasses so many different cultures and economies, that it’s values and rule have to be universal, principally sound and rational.  Since they are being taken at such a high level, they have to be this way, because they cannot take into consideration of every special need of every country. Many Norwegians would very much like that, to sit on the proverbial mountain and gaze at their navels.  Drumming up every possible perverse system they can think of, so they can hide from the unavoidable globalization. Throwing money from a pile of oil money, rather than fixing things, basically constructing a museum which will last as long as the money lasts.

The EU is not perfect, but it’s a continuously improving system that I feel has brought prosperity to the continent and will so in the next decades. This crisis will only make the EU stronger.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The EU is so big and encompasses so many different cultures and economies, that it’s values and rule have to be universal, principally sound and rational. Since they are being taken at such a high level, they have to be this way, because they cannot take into consideration of every special need of every country.


I am sorry, this is simply not true. Case in point is for example the EU agricultural policy, who swallows far to much of the EU's budget. That is billions and billions handed over since French farmers have a strong lobbying group.

That is something you will have to think about - Norway is a small state, and for example, might not have anything to counteract those strong interest down in Brussel. 

&gt;Many Norwegians would very much like that, to sit on the proverbial mountain and gaze at their navels. Drumming up every possible perverse system they can think of, so they can hide from the unavoidable globalization. Throwing money from a pile of oil money, rather than fixing things, basically constructing a museum which will last as long as the money lasts.

I can understand that ""laziness"" that comes with a lot of money - I find many Swedes overusing our social systems, and we are not half as rich. However, you can be very sure that the EU want to do exactly just that, but with Norweigan money. Case in point is just how they have approached this economical mess. 

&gt;The EU is not perfect, but it’s a continuously improving system that I feel has brought prosperity to the continent and will so in the next decades. 

They are not continuisling improving it unfortunately. If you look at the way this Eurozone mess has been handled, they are permanenting transfers, bailing out banks, less transparency, not asking the population what it feels, ignoring rules, ignoring laws and regulations. They doing whatever the opposite of improving is.

I do believe we have to adjust to a global world. However, global doesn't have to mean just the EU. And, at the end of the day I have much more faith in the integrity and sound mind of a Swedish (or Norweigan) prime minister, than an Italian one.

true,tebee,null,null,"I understand the negative reaction to a general availability of guns (I used to think so, too) but I don't think it's warranted. Until 1972 it was possible in large parts of Germany to walk into a Karstadt and just purchase a gun. It was only as a reaction to the RAF that the current general prohibition was enacted.

After reading a lot of opinions on that matter (most importantly [this recent Harvard study](http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Vol30_No2_KatesMauseronline.pdf)) I find it safe to say that the availability of guns does not pose a danger to society, but can even lower the crime rate through private concealed carry.

That is why I would support the idea of introducing CCW in Germany, which is currently only available to a select few (no Sportschütze ""carries a gun"").

Concerning the need for a strong lobby, it is rooted in the fact that there is widespread political opposition to private gun ownership. The SPD wants to impose restrictions which would destroy a large section of the sport, while the greens and the left both want to ban it completely. There are also several organisations fighting against our sport.

In the last 10 years, the law has already been tightened several times, introducing unreasonable requirements and copying bad American ideas.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"This blog post lost its credibility from the beginning due to the writer not knowing even basics about financial and economic situation in Europe or the world.

&gt; The Wall Street Journal carried an article on Wednesday (September 12, 2012) – Latvia Remains Keen on Euro – which reported that the queue to enter the Eurozone remains healthy. I immediately asked why? There is a queue of nations (east and Baltic) who desire to join the Eurozone. 

Because before the crisis individuals and companies in Baltic states took foreign currency denominated loans excessively. If Latvia and Lithuania would devalue their currencies, there would be bankruptcy wave in these countries were individuals, companies and banks that financed them would go bankrupt, which would put these states under threat of a default. This is why it is so important for Baltic countries to join the Euro, because then they will eliminate risks caused by these loans. Not to mention that there are geopolitical and security related motives to join the Eurozone.

&gt; But while the Germans can accuse the Greeks etc of “living beyond their means” it could easily be said that the German government courtesy of the Hartz attacks on living standard in Germany has forced its workers and families to “live below their means”. In other words, the problem is better presented as the Germans deliberately depressing their domestic demand and relying on exports to drive growth which in a currency union with such disparate levels of productivity growth is unsustainable.

Or maybe the reason why wages have stagnated in Germany is because competition has increased globally in traditional German industries and the only way to save those jobs have been to freeze or lower them, another option would have been simply to loose those jobs by having manufacturing moved or outsourced to third countries. The only way wages could and can go up in Germany is to move higher in the food chain, move towards knowledge and service based economy.

&gt; An essential requirement for an effective monetary system is that the citizens have to be tolerant of intra-regional transfers of government spending and not insist on proportional participation in that spending. The other side of this coin is that a particular region might enjoy less of the income they produce so that other regions can enjoy more income than they produce.

Why? Why is it a good idea to spend money on failed regions? If a country or region can't handle competition, if it fails to produce, if it fails to invest, then lowering of living standards until a balance is achieved is the only solution.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"It was US policy from about the 1920's or 1930's to passive aggressively weaken the British Empire, seen as the only real possible threat to the continental United States in that era. Post WW2 the UK was *less* powerful, but the US maintained its policy of weakening the UK where it could, prime example of this being Suez, although Suez was really the final nail in the coffin for us as a world power, it perfectly highlights the culmination of many years of US policy - the UK was indebted to the US after fighting a long war, and when the UK tried to secure its assets in the middle east, at a time when the US was being very, very naughty all over the place, the US essentially forbade us by threatening to collapse our currency, so we had to pull out of Suez and that was that. The US was never *hostile* to the UK, I'll grant you that, but it was never the ally many people seemed to think it was, there were times of cooperation for mutual benefit, but that was as good as it ever got, and when it came to it, more often than not US policy throughout the period of about 1920-1970 was to weaken and harm the UK wherever possible while making it seem like they were our friends.

The reason you've never heard anyone worry about what power the UK has is because we no longer have very much at all, we're a middle power in the world now with a small (but nonetheless respectable) military, the 8th largest economy in the world, and few overseas holdings. At the turn of the 20th century we were considerably more powerful than any other country in the entire world.
