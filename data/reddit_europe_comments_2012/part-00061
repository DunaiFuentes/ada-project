We'r currently voting on the EU stability treaty which is concerned with the ESM fund as well.

*Firstly* ...Thanks so much france and germany for almost everyday saying something that confuses the irish people more and more. A lot of people are considering a No vote (I am a yes supporter) due to comments from Germany and France.

**(a)** Or media has a lot of sympathy for greece as we'r in a similar crisis. There is a growing amount of bitterness as we'r following the terms of our bailout package and Greece aren't. 

Every single person wants a big debt write off as the main reason we weren't allowed to default on debt was too protect european banks which are exposed to us. There's a growing desire for pro stimulus measures, but IMO people don't realise how ineffective gov spending is for stimulus and people have no clue where the money for it should come from.

Theres also a small minority, but not insignificant that want us to leave the Euro entirely and go back to the pound. The Irish and british economies are quite similar.

Germany gets a lot of positive coverage for insisting on austerity, which is popular in the US, but the news has been presenting an increasing number of commentators who say that Europe also needs spending to stimulate growth.  Greece is presented as a troubled state where taxes weren't collected and spending wasn't controlled, and now fascists are rising to power.  There is much more of a focus on the supposedly exorbitant benefits Greeks used to get from the state than on the non-collection of taxes.    Spain and Portugal are presented as having horrible unemployment with little relief in sight.

Sweden/Denmark/Germany/Belgium pay more taxes than Greece, Italy etc. The country with the highest taxes in the world, in total, is Denmark, followed by Sweden. That is true - please show me the data that say it isn't. Generally, looking at that list (or the wiki list, or any other links), Northern Europe pay more taxes than Southern Europe. Are you claiming that is not the case? Originally it was that a Portugese person doubted that a Dane paid more taxes. I said that they did, and, as a general rule, Northern Europeans paid more. 


&gt;you made another statement ""we do not cheat on our taxes"" - which is neither true nor false, it is just pointless when you are trying to discuss data.

I mean, that in addition to paying more taxes (in percentage) we have less of a shadow econonomy and less tax evasion. That is not pointless - you see, if the Greeks actually paid all their taxes, they would not have a budget deficit. We do not have that sort of massive tax evasion that Greece has, or southern Italy. As the link showed, Italy looses billions - money I am sure they could put to better use.

Sure, loss of PIGS as regular export markets will undoubtedly exert a catastrophic influence in the short-term. But the point was that 1) Germany still has plenty of growth potential in the long-term 2) were it not for the PIGS in the first place there would still be globally competitive Germany, albeit a little less stronger economically. PIGS are not ""responsible"" for the German growth because of their borrowing-financed consumption as you and others suggest: it's the inherent strength of German people and economy that is.

I can assure you if they knew that they'd be stuck in a monetary union with such fiscally irresponsible countries they'd have none of it. A bit more modest growth is way cheaper than bankrolling sovereign debts of Eurozone periphery.

Because this involves a transfer of powers from the member states to the union.

Countries hate giving up powers, and voters hate paying for monetary transfers.

You have to remember that this was twenty years ago. Political leaders back then could still remember WWII, Mitterand had even been born during the First. Germany had just been reunited, and even though France wasn't as vocal about it as the UK, there were some real security policy considerations.

This is actually happening in every country, including the UK and the USA. The 'commodities' are just way overvalued due to inflation in the US Dollar.

France has a very good stance to tax financial transactions that cause such problems, but it's being met with resistance from countries which benefit from such money passing through their economy.

Ideally we need to start pricing everything in a currency other than the US Dollar. Obviously we'd be biased to say that it should be priced in euros, which would benefit us, and other people would be angry if we suggested that, so probably the IMF's SDR is the best way forward right after they add the Chinese Yuan to the basket as well..

Hang in there bro.. it seems that the majority of the problems everyone is feeling today are not really related to the euro at all, it's just an easy target for uneducated people to attack. I have no doubts the crisis is very real and countries such as Greece have major problems, but in the rest of the countries (even outside of the eurozone) it's like this: you get paid every month as normal, and your money runs out much faster (I'm sure someone in the UK can confirm this as well) :)

No, I didn't forget. It's a *reeeeal* stretch to interpret that article as a claim that the collapse of the Euro would be good for the UK in the long run. But that is what you started with, and I guess you can't backtrack now.

So, you claim that no one can know what will happen - and then you immediately go on and state that you know exactly what will happen in the next sentence. 

That is nuts.

I am sorry, but this point of view is completely crazy. It really is.

It just won't, and posting a couple of links from fringe viewpoints isn't really going to change my mind about that, nor are said fringe views going to suddenly going to convince me that the dozens of people I know concerned about the Euro collapse are secretly hoping that it will happen because they think they can cash in on it.

a) the  genereal picture in our medias is that the crisis is a global broblem but that the countries of southern Europe are struck especieally hard due to lack of budget dicipline in the past. The problems of Greece are also traced to the Euro, which is also seen as a source of instability. Greece is generally portaited as a country unwilling to face their own problems while taking their frustration out on the germans. The germans on the other hand are percived as taking over Eurpoe. The cirisis in Europe is also seen as validation of the already existing scepsis towards the Euro. (Sweden is not a part of the currency union, as result of a negative outcome in a referedum held in 2004.) As to the soultion of the problem the general opinon refected in the medias is that excessive spending and budget deficits should be avoided, but that the lack of investments in the economy is a problem.

b) I think the majority of the population see rising unemployment in Europe as a majorproblem an want somebody to do something, but not sure what.

Investors across Europe (who were also greedy and foolish) loaned far too much money to Irish banks, more than they could reasonably be expected to pay back, and when the shit hit the fan, our government took the single worst decision any Irish government has taken in the history of the state - to guarantee those bank debts. It is this guarantee, and this alone, that has us in trouble now.

&gt;By our dpa-correspondent and Europe Online
&gt;
&gt;Brussels (dpa) - Introducing a financial transaction tax would weigh down the European economy by far less than expected, and might even spur growth if the proceeds were to be reinvested successfully, leaked European Union papers showed on Tuesday.
&gt;
&gt;Last year, the European Commission calculated that the tax - also known as Tobin tax, after the US economist who first proposed a version of it in the 1970s - would lead to a 0.53-percentage-point loss in EU gross domestic product (GDP) by 2050.
&gt;
&gt;But in a revised calculation seen by dpa and due to be presented at an EU summit on Wednesday, the commission says the cost would only amount to 0.28 per cent of GDP.
&gt;
&gt;Countries hostile to the tax - such as Britain and Sweden - had seized on the commission‘s original calculations to argue that its introduction would be economically harmful.
&gt;
&gt;They argued that financial firms would relocate outside the EU to escape the levy - a phenomenon Sweden experienced when it experimented with the tax in the 1990s.
&gt;
&gt;But in its papers, the commission stressed that a firm would still be liable to pay the tax even if it relocated abroad, as long as it wanted to deal in bonds, shares or derivatives with EU-based clients or on EU-based trading platforms.
&gt;
&gt;Therefore ""the risk of geographical relocation remains rather limited. So do the benefits of relocation,"" it concluded.
&gt;
&gt;By contrast, the Tobin tax would bring in 57 billion euros (72.7 billion dollars) a year in new revenues, the commission said, confirming its previous estimates.
&gt;
&gt;If that money ""were spent - be it at the European or be it at the national level - on growth-enhancing public investment ... simulations show a positive impact of such spending ... in the order of magnitude of 0.2 to 0.4 per cent of GDP,"" the EU executive said.
&gt;
&gt;The commission is to make proposals on how the money could be spent next month, EU Economy Commissioner Olli Rehn said in a speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, ahead of Wednesday‘s summit discussions.
&gt;
&gt;""We will bring new detailed proposals in June on how (these) 57 billion euros a year of revenue could be used for targeted investment,"" he told lawmakers.
&gt;

Outside the tourism industry there are those who speak a range between fluent, a few phrases, and none at all. I would recommend learning a few commonly used phrases such as those found on [Wikitravel](http://wikitravel.org/en/French). The voice simulator on Google Translate does a pretty good, but not perfect, job with pronunciation. 

Simple words and phrases (Hello, Goodbye, Thank You, Pardon Me, How Much?, I would like...) even slightly mispronounced is generally always well received. In addition, the French man on the metro who you just inadvertently elbowed would likely appreciate a *Je suis vraiment désolé.* more than an ""I'm sorry."" I wouldn't worry too much about poor pronunciation, people can live in the country for months and still mispronounce words almost every day. Even so you will still have a heavy accent, just try to do your best. 

The most important thing in my opinion is to know the phrase for ""Do you speak English?"" and to use it whenever first speaking to someone. I believe it sets the tone for the whole conversation. In this way you are asking them to talk in your language as a favor to you whereas otherwise you would be making the assumption that they can speak and are willing to do so to carry on the conversation. Its not a big deal but I would consider it a pleasantry. Likewise, if you speak in French and the person replies in English he or she is also signaling that they can speak English and you may follow suit.

Oh and general positive impression: don't take up the whole sidewalk, stand to the right on escalators and moving walkways, let people off the metro before you try to get on, take off your backpack in a full bus or metro car, and don't sign any petitions duct taped to a folded newspaper.

true,butterandsugarcrepe,null,null,"Very simple: **FOOD**

No matter where you travel, if you really want to make the most of your trip, remember one thing: appeal to ALL your senses.

As you said it in your post *""We've got all the typical touristy locations down to ~see~""*. Lot of people appeal to their eyes only. And yes, Paris has plenty of thing to please your **sight**. But how about the other senses?

Well, **smell** is not so good in Paris, so there's not much to experience with that.

**Hearing**: if you spoke French, I would have definitely suggested to see a classical play at *La Comédie Française*. Very beautiful theatre with one of the most prestigious theatre company. Or maybe go to a concert, but I would recommand to check French music online first.

**Touch**: how about some French kinkiness? Paris is not so well known for it's nightlife (I think London and Berlin are better for that) but you can try to go at a Cabaret in the North of Paris or if this is too soft for you, you can try to get into the Parisian *lifestyle*... But if you don't want anything ""sexual"" (no, French are not *only* horny bastards), you can also just go to a flea market like *les puces de Saint Ouen*. Touching old stuff, watching them, feeling them. That can be very pleasant. And you might have seen this market from Woody Allen's movie, *Midnight in Paris*.

**Taste**? that is probably the easiest way to really experience something different during your trip. Not only you can go to restaurants (you have plenty of choice, from cheap and good, to expensive and awesome) but you can also just go to French markets. Try one of the wine bar (*""bar à vin""*) in Paris. Ask for some cheese with your wine. Also, ask for advices: which cheese should you try? which wine matches which cheese? (this is actually very important). Try the foie gras, it's very easy: just go to a market, buy some good Foie Gras (around 20€ for 2 people) and good bread (remember, a good baguette is usually denser, and the ""*white*"" is actually yellow/brownish/greyish). If you're feeling adventurous, try some snails! with some butter, garlic and *persil*: they are ***delicious!*** Or also very easy: try some **REAL** butter, the one from *Bretagne* (désolé les normands!). Go to a market and look for *Beurre au sel de Guérande*. Put some of it on a piece of bread. It's like rainbows on your tongue (yes, French are poets).

If you're there a relatively short time, learn the pleasantries, menu items, and the cultural differences of when it's expected and right to say certain things (when entering/leaving a shop always greet the person, e.g.).

Unless you've got massive time or the mind of a savant and you're starting with nothing, you won't have time to learn enough French to really pull it off.  Just use English clearly, kindly, at a moderate pace, and without abstract idioms or cultural slang.

Americans aren't the only ones relying on English when they travel, remember.  There's plenty of tourists butchering French AND English. We should, however, know how to use it in a way that make things as easy as possible for everyone.

We have just absurd amounts of public debt (and corruption), but maybe further down the road in that we've financed it.

* Florence: the Uffizi are the most visited museum of Italy. Also, Santa Maria del Fiore (the main church), or the [Piazza della Signoria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_della_Signoria) as a whole, or [Ponte Vecchio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_Vecchio),
* Rome: I'd probably go with the Coliseum, otherwise St. Peter's square (but that is more like Vatican City).
* Naples: the Maschio Angioino or the Vesuvio (mostly for its [funicular history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funicul%C3%AC,_Funicul%C3%A0)), Spaccanapoli
* Sicily: the Etna, the Taormina amphitheater, any beach, any sight of the Eolie islands. Also possibly the Duomo in Monreale with its incredible frescos, or anything from Palermo (google should help).

true,icandoitbetter,null,null,"Germany is benefitting from the European Union. Its economy suffers from a lack of internal demand, and the shared currency system provided it with a market to which it could sell exports cheaply. Moreover, Germany was able to fight inflation (a recurrent German fear) by having a shared currency that is devalued through the participation of the weaker southern economies. The southern countries, which are less competitive, did not receive the same benefits. Indeed, their competitiveness was hurt by the cheap access to imports, and they were not in the position to devalue their currencies in order to make their own exports more competitive. This is what you need to understand: Germany is the one that is getting the free ride here. It *needs* to prop up the south in order for the whole currency area thing to work. It's not about being humanitarian or generous; it's just what it needs to do. 

Also, the bailouts never helped Greece. They were really payments from the ECB to the banks that held Greek debt. The Germans spent almost no taxpayer money helping the Greeks. What they spent it on was bailing out banks.

if you say so...

&gt; Because keeping recidivism low is the only rational goal of a justice system, and telling offenders that you don't want them to be a part of society is the opposite of what you want to achieve in the long term.

Ok, but I don't see how banning prisoners from voting is going to negatively affect recidivism. Cutting rehabilitation programmes, training and other things, sure that'll impact the rate at which criminals re-offend. 

Banning prisoners from voting is a useful, if token way, of saying ""bad behaviour will not be rewarded"" - if they want to be a part of society then don't commit a crime.

Just to elaborate: this zone (La Bisbal) is quite nice, but for a first stay at the country, I think it's much better to visit Madrid or Barcelona. Probably you can't do anything about this, but, hey, just wanted to mention anyway.

Places: I remember vaguely that L'Estartit, Escala and Roses were worth a visit. Also, Cap de Creus (""Creus Point"") is a Natural Park (but don't expect Yellowstone) and there's a monastery there. The beaches are very nice in this area (small, clean).

In the coast, there's quite a bit of tourism (specially from Germany). People there probably will speak rudimentary English. Away from there, only Catalan is spoken usually, although everybody speaks and understands Spanish. Don't be afraid of the ""language wars"": being a foreigner, nobody at all will mind if you speak Spanish. Learn to say ""Bon dia"" and a couple of other words in Catalonian and you can score better. But it's not a requirement at all.

Food: not an expert here. I remember ""butifarra amb mongetes"", ""suquet de peix"".  ""Calçots"" are very tasty but it's already too late in the year for this, and really this are is not a ""calçots"" production area.

Wine: this is a wine production area (Empordà) if you are into this.

Books: Josep Pla's ""El quadern gris"" (""The grey notebook"") is a notable book from the first half of 20th century, revolving around this area.

There was an emergency budget within weeks of the election. There's large cuts across every department except international aid and healthcare, the latter of which is getting a huge reorganisation. Welfare is getting majorly reformed. Even the military are having large budget cuts.

My personal experience with the federal government is relatively limited, in that unlike some of my friends, I've never worked for it. With the police, on the other hand, most of my dealings have been pretty good. No one here is afraid to talk to the police or anything, and they certainly aren't corrupt. If you tried to bribe one, you'd probably end up in jail. In general, police are a lot more trusted in America, then say in a lot of Europe, which is part of why we let them guns as opposed to say the UK. There are exceptions of course, because there are poor areas, especially in Chicago or New York, where the police are blamed for a lot of problems. As for the fed, public opinion is mixed. Most people wish it was either dissolved or officially added into the federal government.

&gt;Congress has 5% approval.

I don't see what that has to do with your earlier comment. Are you talking about the efficacy of the federal government, or its popularity?

&gt;Money being stolen from Federal reserve and everything is declining.

It doesn't seem like you know what the fed is. The fed loans money to the federal government via bonds at an interest rate, and is part of the distributions system in the US for new credit and currency. Basically the federal government gets its 'permission' to print new money buy selling these bonds to the fed. The fed can't refuse orders though, so the federal government really has all the power.

&gt;People losing jobs, factories moved to Asia.

Some outsourcing happens, like Foxcon in China. But other times Asian countries outsource labor to us. For example, we're often contracted to build things for them, and Japan has tons of factories in the US. It goes both ways really. People loose jobs all the time in the US, because there's less job security than in most of Europe. The difference is that there's also more job gains, so people have a less concrete career path in the US and often times end up doing lots of things over the course of one lifetime. There are exceptions of course, but in general the economic situation isn't significantly worse than it was 5 years ago. It's just that it's all getting a lot of attention now in the media. On the whole the US economy is doing alright right now, not great, but not catastrophically.

&gt;Please, do share with us with your vision of ""one, big government"".

&gt;We have problem with roads, serious problems, and each road builder knows that EU funds a lot to improve our roads, but government steals without any mercy.

Sucks to hear the Latvian government is taking those funds. In the US, road building is handled by both the federal government for cross-state or military roads and by state governments for every other kind, so as a result roads vary by region. Where I come from, we have some of the worst. Here in LA there's been a lot of construction for new high ways through the mountain valleys, so maybe that's changing. Other places have huge road building budgets. Texas for example has a lot under construction at any one time, and they strictly uses their own quarries for materials, so their roads are completely different looking than those in California.

D'Alema proposed financing a European economic stimulus program through euro bonds and not factoring the associated expenditures into the national deficits.

&gt; The new SPD-Green Party coalition government in Germany, led by Schröder, rejected the proposal. Nevertheless, the new approach had taken hold in Rome, as Stenglin wrote in a cable to Bonn on Nov. 18. He noted that members of the Italian government were demanding that the budget consolidation be spread out, the stability pact be interpreted more flexibly and Italy be freed ""from the shackles of the Maastricht Treaty.""

&gt; The thing that struck me about WW2, was entering big German cities (like say, Munich) for the first time in my life. I was excited to be seeing medieval chapels &amp; cathedrals and architecture. Instead I was driving through non-descript kind of 50's post-war slab-sided concrete architecture. Only then, I began to realise the level of devastation from WW2.

Oh, yeah - have you been to Hamburg, too? I live there, and from what I know, almost 40-50% of the city was destroyed in WWII (do you know about Operation Gomorrha? Horrible.), so there's not much of an 'Altstadt' here but sleek buildings and boring concrete buildings and whatever else - but the few old buildings that are left are still beautiful, and overall Hamburg does deserve being called 'the cool beauty' with the Alster Lake and the grand Rathaus and the harbor and all the green! Well, we've got the Reeperbahn, too, but the red-light-district isn't really known for historical authenticity... ;-) 

I haven't been to Regensburg (but I'll check it out should I be travelling down south), but you should visit Heidelberg, which also wasn't bombed, too, and it's beautiful! The view from the castle up on the hill is amazing. Or Rothenburg ob der Tauber, which has lots of lovely half-timbered houses. I'm originally from the Rhineland, and there are some gems to be found around there - if you ever travel by train, do take the slow route from Cologne to Frankfurt along the Rhine river, there are castles (or ruins that once were castles) all along the shores, and the vineyards, oh - a truly beautiful view! *sighs* Now I want to go back... I've been visiting friends and family in Cologne the last weekend. Or try visiting any of the small islands up North (Pellworm, Juist, Föhr etc.), they're showing a different and equally beautiful side of Germany. 

I do have to say that it's a pity that old Dresden hasn't survived - it truly was a beautiful city and I would have loved visiting it 100 years ago. One of my favorite childhood authors (Erich Kästner) grew up there and he wrote a book about his youth and oh, it was so heartbreaking how he described the destruction of the city and how so many places dear to his heart were just simply gone.

They’re already paying you money to take their money. As long as the interest is below inflation the money (incl. interest) will be worth less in two years than it is now.

Recently Denmark has had to set its interest at below that of Germany to keep the kroner from rising out of the agreed upon interval.

Do you know what is to be in family of four and have the 2 providers lose their jobs? Do you know what is to have the bank foreclose the house you cannot pay because you lost your job, take that same house to Auction, have it sold to the bank that lent you the money for less than the money you own and end up with no house and 50 000€ in debt? Do you know what is to be a doctor, to have a pay cut of 10%, and increase of extra hours and have only half the extras payed after you worked a 82 hour week? Do you know what is to perform a surgery when you haven't slept for 36h? Do you know what is to suffer all that knowing than in Germany or the UK I would easily earn the 3x with half the work and the same food costs? Do you know what it is to suffer all of this and knowing that you cannot complain because you are the only of your friends who has a job? Do you know what is to walk through a ghost town because all the shops are closed, the fuel is to expensive and people cannot even harness the will to go out of their houses for a walk at night because it is so painful to walk on the ruins of what once were?

The Socialist Party is explained as ""the French equivalent of the Democrats,"" with it being understood that they are to the left of the Democrats, but fill the same role (the huge, mainstream leftist party, as ""leftist"" is defined by the culture at issue).  There is not any kind of panic or furor over his election, at least not that I've seen (possibly he's getting insulted or undermined on Fox News, but I don't watch Fox News).  With that said, I'm sure conservative Americans already thought France was socialist, so the election of a socialist probably met their expectations and did not surprise them.

There was a bit of speculation about whether Hollande's election would hurt the global economy, perhaps by causing more controversy and uncertainty in the EU crisis by challenging Germany's austerity plans, and about whether rich people might leave France for London if he raises taxes on the rich, but for the most part, it's all been about how Hollande will interact with Merkel. 

The US media has accepted the argument that Europe needs spending as well as austerity, so it could be argued that the US media is, overall, agreeing with Hollande on that issue.

The people of America tend to have an ""it's their country, let them pick their own leaders; it's none of our business"" attitude toward foreign elections, unless the foreign leader is perceived as insulting or threatening America in some way.  Even in the case of Chavez, however, I've heard a lot of Texans say, ""Venezuela is their country, they can pick whomever they want to lead it.""  I haven't heard any Americans say, ""How dare the French elect a Socialist!""  All they do is speculate on how Holland's election might affect Greece, and whether it will help solve or worsen the Greek crisis, which is the European situation Americans really care about.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;My impression is that Americans might agree on certain of his positions towards austerity but are still against his general ideology as they beleive Socialism=big government and less freedom.

Definitely.  Socialism is very unpopular in the US.  If you were to ask Americans for their thoughts on socialism, you would get an overwhelmingly negative response.

However, Americans are not too concerned that France elected a member of its Socialist Party.  I believe this is because Americans already considered France a socialist country, so they are not surprised that they elected a socialist.  Also, the French Socialist Party is hardly a new upstart in French politics, so it would be a bit disingenuous for the media to pretend Hollande represented a break with the norm for French politics.  Finally, Americans do not want to interfere in French politics - they might think socialism is a bad choice, but it's not their country.  France seems very far away to many people in the US.

Now, if a random American is stopped on the street and asked what he or she thinks about the new socialist prime minister of France, that person will probably say something critical of socialism or France.  But does that same person spend his or her time thinking about France's prime minister or loathing France's internal political situation?

I agree with you :-).


&gt;Biggest 'political' risks here are non-EU countries that would lose EU funds and might not join the EU some day because of that or because they don't meet the standards

No, I do not agree with you there. Biggest political risk is that I, and a lot of people like me have lost all faith in the EU, and is turning more and more against it. It is not democratic, it blatantly supports corruption and behaviour that completely against the rules and then punishes those who actually behaves (we voted against the Euro, why on earth are you trying to force stupid FTT on us). That is a far bigger risk than possible future states. 


&gt;And use all our democratic given rights to try to steer this out of control truck called EU. 

It's not working. They are promising funds I don't think they have to right to promise, they politicians do not seem to know how to vaguely balance a budget (a lot of them at least) and no one, as far as I know, has been punished or held accountable for their crimes/wrong decisions. 


&gt;Right now they slow down by not enforcing the rules.

I don't think they are slowing down by enforcing. We saw what happened with the Euro when they just forged ahead, without regards to rules or democracy.

The Data is from a 2005 EU survey, you can find it [here](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf).
However, this data is 7 years old and i would imagine that the percentage of people in Europe undestanding English has grown. I am shure there are more recent surveys on this. But there is a hole other problem: the 51% of 2005 does not include people that have a basic undestandig of english, that is not quite on the conversational level. Besides, these are surveys where the people asked have to evaluate their language skills themselves, so the real knowlege of the English language ma differ form the percentage in the survey results. 

As to your ""real"" question: English is mandatory in Germany, but the schooling system is a federal system in Germany, so the regulations differ between the federal states. It also differs between school forms. 
As to why it was made mandatory: I think that also differs from state to state.

a) 
There is not one answer to this. The boulevard was at first blaming Greece and to a lesser extend Spain, Italy and Portugal for fucking things up. I think that phase has passed now. Now it's just a big confusion. Maybe because the German economy is doing better the ever, with steady growth and record-lows in unemployment. But there is also a lot of misinformation. Both media and government have miserably failed to explain to the people what is really going on.

b) 
I think it is a strange mixture of happiness, that our economy is doing so well and the infamous German Angst that is creeping up. The People are afraid that they will have to pay for all that mess and that the crisis will come nocking on their doorstep. At first there was an awful lot of trust in Ms Merkel and her pervious government with the social democrats, but since Ms Merkels party is ruling in coalition with the bussiness-friendly liberal FDP, trust in the government is gone, as Ms Merkel is changing her positions almost on a daily basis.

So... tyranny of the majority then?

&gt; Yeah because why the fuck shouldn't they be entitled to take the property from people who have something they want or kick the shit out of someone when you disagree with their point of view. Its a disgrace that the government create laws against it.

I don't think that, you obviously don't, and it's a fair assumption that most people don't either, but some may do and in a democracy they should have the right to have their opinion heard despite not agreeing with the majority. It's the principle of the thing, even if I personally would agree that the idea of legalising theft or assault is ridiculous.

&gt; What utter liberal bullshit. I can guarantee you that the last thing criminals are thinking about when they commit a theft, burglary, assault, rape, murder etc is politics.

The problem with this attitude is that not all laws are created equally. Sure, today Britain is a democratic and open country, but what if the next government makes it a crime to say something negative about them in public, or something equally silly like that? Then suddenly you'll have a bunch of political prisoners who's right to vote (granted, such a government would probably not keep that right around anyway, but we are talking theory here) has been taken away not because they are a danger to society but because they don't agree with the current status quo. Hell, even today in Britain you arguably have political criminals (libel laws, anyone?) who really shouldn't be silenced because of their actions.

Furthermore in principle the idea that as soon as you are sentenced for a crime you are no longer fully part of society is ridiculous. Prisoners and criminals are just as much a part of any society as anyone else. Not the best-adjusted part obviously but they are still citizen and they are still people and they should have all the rights that anyone else have when it comes to democracy, because that's what our chosen system of government is all about (in theory, at least): letting all the voices be heard. And besides, they still have to live under the current regime. They are not freed from the political system of the country just because they are in prison, and the government still has a responsibility to look after their well-being, only if they can't vote then the prisoners don't have any say in how the government is supposed to be doing that (thus the government can get away with neglecting to take proper care of prisons and the prison system since it is completely populated by silent voices.)

Second of all, Democrats are just as willing and able to engage in character assassination as the GOP. Since the Democrats present themselves as the protectors of racial minorities and immigrants, the character assassination usually comes in the form of vague accusations of Republican racism.

Röhm spoke of a ""second revolution"" against ""reactionaries"" (the National Socialist label for old-line conservatives), as the National Socialists had previously dealt with the Communists and Socialists.
&gt;All this was threatening to the business community. So Hitler swiftly reassured businessmen that there would be no ""second revolution."" Many ""storm troopers"" were of working-class origins and had expected a socialist programme. In fact, it was often said at the time that members of the SA were like a beefsteak — ""brown on the outside and red on the inside"". They were now disappointed by the new regime's lack of socialist direction and also failure to provide the lavish patronage expected. Röhm even publicly criticized Hitler for his failure to carry through the National Socialist revolution.
&gt;Furthermore, Röhm and his SA colleagues thought of their force (now over three million strong) as the future army of Germany, replacing the Reichswehr and its professional officers. Although Röhm had been a member of the officer corps, he viewed them as ""old fogies"" who lacked ""revolutionary spirit."" In February 1934, Röhm demanded that the Reichswehr (which under the Treaty of Versailles was limited to 100,000 men) be absorbed into the SA under his leadership as Minister of Defence.[6]

.....

&gt;However, both the Reichswehr and business conservatives continued their anti-SA complaints to Hindenburg. In early June 1934, defence minister Werner von Blomberg, on Hindenburg's behalf, issued an ultimatum to Hitler: unless political tension ended in Germany, Hindenburg would likely declare martial law and turn over control of the country to the army. Knowing such a step could forever deprive him of power, Hitler decided to carry out his pact with the Reichswehr to suppress the SA. This meant a showdown with Röhm. In Hitler's view, the army and the SA constituted the only real remaining power centres in Germany that were independent in his National Socialist state.

&gt; **Abstract**: British and US imperial policies have explicitly aimed at physical and mental occupation worldwide. The critical analysis of the resultant global inequality needs to explore how it was legitimated. The myth of terra nullius, expounded by Locke, served to legitimate European colonial dominance, which was denounced by Kant. Americanisation has been exported as a cultura nullius serving to consolidate consumerism and the underlying military and economic system. Neoliberalism increases inequality that is a causal factor in dysfunctional capitalist societies. The economic and political integration of Europe has been closely coordinated with and choreographed by the US. The presence of English has been dramatically increased throughout Europe. Its active promotion worldwide is of major political and economic significance for the UK and the USA. Advocates of English as universally valid, including the current applied linguistic vogue for analysing English as a ‘lingua franca’, see English as a lingua nullius detached from the forces behind is expansion. The integration of European higher education is being coerced into a single template, ‘internationalisation’ equating with ‘English-medium studies’. Some European countries however are forming language policy to ensure that English is only used additively. Critical scholarship that seeks to increase social justice exposes how occupation, physical and mental, has been legitimated and can be counteracted.

the British Empire and the United States who, fortunately for the progress of mankind, happen to speak the same language and very largely think the same thoughts.  
The power to control language offers far better prizes than taking away people’s provinces or lands or grinding them down in exploitation. The empires of the future are the empires of the mind.

The plan is for the United States to rule the world. The overt theme is unilateralism, but it is ultimately a story of domination. It calls for the United States to maintain its military superiority and prevent new rivals from rising up to challenge it on the world stage. It calls for dominion over friends and enemies alike. It says not that the United States must be more powerful, or most powerful, but that it must be absolutely powerful.

*D. Armstrong in Harper’s Magazine 305, 2002.*

It is nonetheless the desire of every state (or its ruler) to achieve lasting peace by thus dominating the whole world, if at all possible. But nature wills it otherwise, and uses two means to separate the nations and prevent them from intermingling – linguistic and religious differences. These may certainly occasion mutual hatred and provide pretexts for war, but as culture grows and men gradually move towards greater agreement over their principles, they lead to mutual understanding and peace.

Pour rappel, si cette annonce a été faite trés vite par le nouveau ministre c'est parceque c'est une réforme du gvnt sarkozy qui a été mal vécu dans les écoles et trés contestée, et que le nouveau gvnt a voulu marquer qu'ils defont ce qui a été fait avant. D'autres problématiques se posent à l'école primaire suite aux précédentes réformes : suppression des RASED par exemple (qui concentraient là vraiment les éléves en difficulté ou besoin de soutien spécifique) ... et là aussi un retour en arriére est attendu.

Au final ce que l'on peut souhaiter c'est que les prochaines réformes soient le fruit de la concertation et du consensus, et pas des directives qui tombent d'en haut et qui sont battues en brêche par les acteurs de l'école au quotidien parce que on a bien vu que cela ne fonctionne pas.

well, as I see it, a huge part of the problem is that people still care way too much about sentiments and appearances. It's as if people don't realize how dire the situation really is. Sorry I offended you by speaking the truth as I know it. The point is: your offense simply doesn't matter. We are way past the time for being indignant. And I do have empathy for you, I really do but the reality of the situation is that we all have to face that the way our governments work is not sustainable and needs to change. This change will be hard for a while (see Iceland, they had 2 really shitty years before it got better) but the alternatives are even worse. You can have reform and actual austerity (meaning the state quits spending what it does not have) right now and it will be tough but if you don't, ultimately it will be even worse. Eurobonds and lose monetary policies are only stopgap measures that will make the problem worse in the long run. They are what the Americans call ""the hair of the dog"" or drinking alcohol to get rid of a hangover. 

&gt; You can stay at my house if you want, I'll repay you all your magnitude and consideration for not submitting us to ""real austerity"" with a clean bed and full plate on the table.

I'm not submitting you to anything and neither is Germany. Reality is. And that's why ultimately this pleading is completely besides the point. The PIIGS are broke, that's the problem. The solution isn't to go into debt even further. And if you still do then the austerity that bankruptcy will submit you to will be quite a lot worse than what these countries are asked to do now.

The bureaucracy of a US citizen moving to Italy is a complete nightmare and you either have to marry an italian, work for an italian company, attend university, or be retired with a constant income to prove you can support yourself.

Came extremely close twice, but in the end they always go with somebody that somone in the company knows personally. Being American, I know nobody well enough for them to vouch for me.

My advice: Apply for an American University in Florence or something.....It will be your best bet in staying, unless of course you speak italian and can get into an italian uni. So if you are serious.....You need to start learning Italian ASAP. It can be done (fulfilling your dream of living here), it's just very difficult.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's not as simple as you make it sound. Yes, the fascists fought the communists but that simply doesn't mean that their ideologies must have been 100% opposed. The matter of the fact is that fascists have significant overlap with socialists. I've got a few choice quotes from Wikipedia here:

First the definition of fascism which is a lot more suitable then the completely useless left / right paradigm:

&gt; Fascism is a radical authoritarian nationalist political ideology.

Fascism and other ideologies:

&gt; Fascism opposes multiple ideologies: conservatism, liberalism, and two major forms of socialism—communism and social democracy.[11] Fascism claims to **represent a synthesis** of cohesive ideas previously divided between traditional political ideologies.[12]

Fascism and Classes:

&gt; Fascists claim that their ideology is a trans-class movement, advocating resolution to domestic class conflict within a nation to secure national solidarity. It claims that its goal of cultural nationalization of society **emancipates the nation's proletariat**, and promotes the assimilation of all classes into proletarian national culture.


Fascism and markets:

&gt; Fascists advocate a state-directed, regulated market economy that is dedicated to the nation


And by the by, the first thing every socialist state does is to outlaw unions. You see, with emancipated workers there is no need for unions, according to them.

Here are some very socialist parts of the nazi program:

&gt; * Abolition of unearned (work and labour) incomes. Breaking of debt (interest)-slavery.

&gt; * We demand the nationalisation of all (previous) associated industries (trusts).

&gt; * We demand a division of profits of all heavy industries.

&gt; * We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare.

&gt; * We demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest. Common national criminals, usurers, profiteers and so forth are to be punished with death, without consideration of confession or race.

The success that fascism had is due to completely pandering to every base and vile instinct ie xenophobia, envy and entitlement. It's fair to say that they are the perfect synthesis of left and right-wing politics.

The Internet did not exist back when I was in school so was not a factor for me. 

One important aspect of mastering English was the wide availability of books and games which were in English. French and German sections in the library and bookshops were much smaller or even non-existent.

TV and cinema was not dubbed but instead had subtitles, thus providing exposure to the original language. With Hollywood titles having a large market share I got exposed a lot more to American English than any other language.

Well, yes, but one need other systems as well. What I reacted to, was that it seemed unusual to you. Also, that only concerns the income tax, not all the other taxes one pays, like VAT, taxes on houses, employment, capital  etc.

First, I don't think they have been doing that everywhere (until possibly recently). The perception that people don't pay taxes in the south comes among other things from:

Since American media is practically shoved down our throats, it's not surprising actually that the numbers are growing steadily. I do see the benefit a common language and wish more people could speak English. THe thing is, as a foreigner you are more likely to meet with or introduced to people who can speak English, but the truth is, the number of English speakers in Romania and Hungary isn't that big. At least from my experience Romanian online seem to be more versed in English, with most of them including a few words in their posts, however I also frequent some Hungarian forums and the situation there is that they either speak English, or they don't speak it at all. (although I'm hoping IRL it's better)

English is mandatory in schools but kids still won't learn it if they are not interested. My ex-classmates are perfect examples.  English taught in school is very basic and it's impossible to fail the course, but the problem is with the curriculum imo. It's simply not engaging enough, it can't catch the attention of the students unfortunately. 

The best you can do until you finish high school is A1 without any extracurricular activities. However thanks to the internet, video games and films (since they are often not available in Romanian, or Hungarian) most of them are forced to read, play and watch(with subtitles) in English and that is contributing greatly. 

The number of English speakers is growing imo, but it's stopped being an asset and is nowadays a requirement. If you give in a CV they basically already expect you to speak English. I was at a job expo a few months ago and most companies are now searching for people who can speak German.

I learned it from TV back in the early 90s when Cartoon Network first came to Romania. I also learned German from TV so I'm good to go. The plan is that I'll also learn a few other languages but it's not a priority at the moment.",0,1337854345,null,0,false,0,c4rrt68,t3_u1xob,t1_c4rrt68,t3_u1xob,null,1428990196,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Excuse my ignorance, but what is the ""KZ""?

&gt;Oh, yeah - have you been to Hamburg, too? I live there, and from what I know, almost 40-50% of the city was destroyed in WWII 

No I haven't spent any decent time there (I think I may have driven through it without stopping when I went to Flensburg in the north?). But ironically, I read about the dreadful bombing of Hamburg the very night before I got your post (I'm currently reading a few books on the American 8th Air Force in WW2).

The passage in the book about the RAF (British night-time bombing) Hamburg raid, even though written by a American, was absolutely harrowing. The inferno (which it literally was) was so intense, it caused winds of *150mph* to blow in Hamburg. The air itself seemed to be burning. People bursting into flame - women and their children. Entire crowds of people literally roasted in underground bomb shelters. The next day, in daylight, the US 8th Air Force flew their daytime raid. The bomb-aimers reported that even at their altitude of 17,000 feet, their faces prickled with the heat miles below, like standing in front of a roaring fireplace.

And you know what this just reminded me of? I recall driving on a business trip once, I was in the back seat with an American and two older German guys. They argued vehemently - and in English! - about whether it was the Americans bombing at night and the English at daytime, or vice versa. It was astounding to me - these guys were talking about what had actually happened to *their* country and *their* families. A memory I'll never forget.

&gt;Ah, come back anytime! :-)

One day! Springtime, maybe. One thing that struck me about the Germans I met &amp; spent time with there - even thought the Germans get such a hard time by British comedians etc, I found them to be incredibly warm and friendly and helpful to me. Unlike say, some of the French.

The issue is that what is officially known as FYROM is consisted of people of slavic descent and is now trying to forge a national identity for itself, which fair enough, makes sense. A national identity keeps people united and is generally very useful. 

The problem is that they picked another people's national identity and are not trying to claim their history as their own. That is a very very perilous issue, especially in the balkans that have had massive issues with forced migrations, minority populations and land claims that arose from exactly such circumstances.

Part of the widespread objection to something like racism (besides the fact that it's scientifically wrong) is that to be opposed to a specific people in spite of any choices they did or did not make is bad. Europeans and Americans didn't ship black people to Africa for centuries because of their culture, they did it because they were black, and therefore were considered to be inferior.

I don't even want that for the Gypsies. All I want is to be able to go to the supermarket without 4 gypsy children begging for money promising prayers to God in my name. If you however refuse then they curse you down to the devil. Every single time.

I also want to sit in the park without being bothered by gypsies yet again begging for money. I want to go down the street without a gypsy woman with the kid on her breasts begging money using her kid to morally blackmail you into giving something. (I don't) I also want to stop at a red light without a gypsy banging on my window yet again asking for money. I also don't want to see them using the fountain in the middle of town as their personal swimming pool. 

If they can't become productive members of society they can't integrate. School is free here, getting proper education is not an excuse. Universities have specific scholarship programs just for gypsies. I wouldn't have a problem with them otherwise. 

As for work, only those can't find jobs who don't want to work. There is always something to do and instead of sending out their kids onto the streets to beg threatening them with a beating, they should go do some jobs that they are capable of handling. Not everything requires a university degree. Of course the first is easier then the latter, not to mention the government is giving away money in form of aids, but also in cash so they can survive, yet they don't give anything back. I'm not saying the government shouldn't offer this to them or to anyone, they however should impose a limit on how many months you can get this in your life.

What is paternal? What is the essence we're talking about here? It's not religion, you can be Roma and be of different religions. It's not race, for the concept is nonsense. Is it culture? Possibly. You choose your culture though.

&gt;Well Roma culture isn't necessarily bad, it's just that some parts of it are, just like any culture.

The question isn't whether no part is, or all is (for the dichotomy is false, and both options wrong) - the question is, how much is rotten, and can it be fixed at this point, can the culture adapt (as it has so far spectacularly failed to do) or does it need to be abandoned all together.

Judging by the prevalence of negative personal experiences, it's not ""a few"". To be honest, I think the question is very much of how to fix Roma culture (or even, whether to). It's a broken culture which, before the modern aspects were introduced, was suited to a pre-industrial society.

For now those people are (still) surviving with the help of friends, family and a mix of social relationships network support and state social support. For the economy output and the country overall productivity it's a utter tragedy. I don't come across many tax evasion situations.

I do notice that somehow the labour market is more dynamic now (firing people now happens more frequently because of the economy and less labour protection), but on the other side there's a generalization of the precarious labour and the so called 'green receipts' that don't count as a work but as (loose) services payment (they can suspend the service/fire you really at anytime), don't establish a work contract, leaves the tax contribution to the 'colaborator'/employee (~25% from the pay), no vacations right, no extra vacations pay, teorically no schedule (but they can always threat to cut your service if you don't respect one), difficult and sometimes no access to entitlements (unemployment, sickness, etc).

Note: this mechanism was put forward several years ago to let *employed people* account some little/home/personal extra work they make or to the so called 'freelancers'. It was never intended to be used in a regular job, in the matter of fact is ""illegal"" in such conditions, but, *since the very own State is the largest contractor under this terms* and the people generally are afraid to lose even this precarious services payment/'wage', the practice became largely generalized.

There's a raging protest against this situation for years now, well before the finantial crisis, but the employers always enjoyed this kind of labour limbo. And, of course, as the economy worsens more and more people are 'accepting' these terms.

On the other hand the companies accounts/tax forms are heavily scrutinized (thanks to a huge effort on digitalizing the finance and tax ministry) in terms of where their money came and went so it's difficult to evade tax without a grand or shady scheme, off-shores, etc. I would bet that there's more tax evasion on a B2B level, like two companies declaring less raw material/services/etc trading between each other.",0,1337858984,null,0,1337860058,0,c4rs72f,t3_u22i4,t1_c4rs72f,t3_u22i4,null,1428990355,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

The thing is, since the euro, the corrupt 2 party system created a huge debt that is unpayable. In order to pay it they entered the austerity referendum which makes sure the debts are payed through greeks' and Europeans' tax money, but also creates deeper and deeper recession and unemployment in greece, without any possibility of growth. So when unemployment has reached 50% for people under 30, for a debt they didn't create, by goverments most of them never voted, there's a great shift in wanting a radical solution, even if that means defaulting on the debt and expulsion from the eurozone.

How would debt be illegal? 

&gt; So when unemployment has reached 50% for people under 30, for a debt they didn't create, by goverments most of them never voted

That's a bit of a stretch. If you're under 22 then chances are you've not voted in an election before, otherwise you've had the option to vote in at least 1 election, indeed there have been 4 elections in Greece since 2000.

I'm reasonably sure there are quite a lot of people post-30 who didn't create the debt either.

&gt; since the return to our national coin has been portrayed as hell on earth, but the truth is our economy went from bad to worse since the euro

The EU spent a lot of money on Greek public works and had that been coupled with sensible reforms you could have had a much more successful economy. 

Some people seem to think that expulsion from the Eurozone and default is going to be painfree, it isn't. Even with the slender budget surplus that Greece is now running all capital expenditure would stop and debt markets would not be kind. I presume the EU would wade in in some form but you'd see similar austerity requested via those mechanisms.

Firstly, I do not see why the unilateral introduction of such a tax will be any different to what [happened to Sweden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_financial_transaction_tax). The revenues were vastly lower than predicted due to a massive reduction in transactions, avoidance, and an exodus of the financial sector to more tax-friendly locations. The long term beneficiaries of a unilateral EU FTT are New York, Hong Kong and Zurich, which will attract business from London and Edinburgh. The harmful derivative trading does exactly the same damage if it happens in New York as it does when it happens in London.

Secondly, of course this has wide support in Europe, because the tax will mainly be raised in the UK. [It is estimated that 75% of EU financial transactions occur in London](http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/europe/newsid_9721000/9721462.stm). Over 10% of UK taxes are raised from the financial sector (even more before 2008), and it employs over a million people. Considering the UK is in recession, it is crass of the European commission to average their estimates of medium term economic damage over the entire EU, and claim that that makes its impact negligible. This assessment is by the European commission itself, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was a little overly optimistic (like the comically optimistic growth forecasts from the supposedly relatively independent bank of England we've had over the past few years).

If I told you Bulgarian was a piece of pie and you learned it within a group that discarded it as the easiest and most important of languages, and you lived in a society heavily influenced by Bulgarian, you'd learn Bulgarian much faster and easier. Even if we write the same alphabet and some of the words ""sound the same"", learning Russian is as hard as for anybody else. Because it is not just about recognizing a word, it's about ""controlling"" the language.

Literally all Germans say English is an ""easy, simplistic language"", much easier than German but in the same time *somehow* not a single fucking German can even learn how to pronounce fucking **""THE""**, they can't even process the idea of that sound. The average German student speaks English worse than the worst integrated Gastarbeiter speaks German. Try any German who pretends to speak English fluently to process a real British English scientific paper and he'd spend 20 minutes on the first two pages.

First, Greece has nothing to do if Macedonia enters the EU or Nato. Greece has no power in choosing who enters, they just follow orders in the EU/Nato. . . If the powerful countries in EU wanted Macedonia in the EU or Nato they would be in in a split second, stop thinking that greece is stopping you from joining because that is not true . . . even if they didnt want you to join, its not there choice.

Second you have to understand how important Greek history is to greece, Philip and Alexander the Great were two of the most important Greek figures in ALL greek history. The only comparison I could make is to  George Washington of the USA. Philip literally CREATED greece with his own hands. He forced all these seperate city-states to join as a single country and then Alexander took these newly allied cities now a single country and he conquered the East, for Greece. I will never understand how  an ex-soviet country who has had nothing to ever do with greece decide that Alexander is there own now, the confusion and ignorance is what pisses off most greek people.

Second you have absolutely no clue what is going on economically in greece, there is a new war going on. . . this new war is not with guns or ships. It is with bankers, IMF, ECB, ""bailouts"", debt and politicians. Germany is trying to crash the greek economy on purpose in order to centralize power in germany. FOr example the head of the ECB wants to place a new European goverment that controls all of EUrope in Germany.

It sounds much better like that. :P

Anyway, honestly, that sounds like one of the most viable solutions, can't just all EU countries make a referendum in their respective countries and those who accept start themselves in furthering integrating Europe?

It's basically what happened since the early days of the EEC, some countries take the initiative and see if things work better with more unification and then others join along the way, progressively making the continent as a country as a whole and less like a bunch of states arguing among themselves.

Sure, this is a simplistic view of the whole process, but it must be better than how things currently are, as this North Europe vs South Europe or Germany vs Greece or whatever is going on can only harmful for the union as a whole.

Oh, and the referendum is a must, countries not interested or whose population is clearly against this would not only be illegitimate democratically speaking, it would also bring up cohesion problems, and we have enough of those as it is.

You're talking as if those 5% were in power. I can also make apocalyptic scenarios as to what would happen if the commies got into office and nationalized fucking everything, but since that's not going to happen anytime soon, just don't bother too much about it.

&gt;The only thing austerity will achieve is to make life miserable for the Greeks.

If this is miserable, then without austerity it would be even worse. It got to where it is not because they spent too few but because they spent too much. You can't outspend your way out of a spending crisis, it doesn't work like that.

&gt;It would be much more profitable for Europe as a whole to work out a deal that doesn't include crazy austerity measures in the middle of a depression.

The ideal situation would be saving while the economy is booming and spending while there's a recession. But no, our governments spend too much all the fucking time and now when we actually need money to deal with the situation, there isn't any, it was all spent previously, when it wasn't necessary.

It's a very simple concept that our governments don't seem to grasp, and now we're all paying for it.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"Bah, that sounds sort of like the situation in the US.  Here, there is a very complex system of tax deductions and credits which people and corporations can claim if they qualify.  Using this system of legal ""tax evasion,"" plus creative accounting and investment in offshore tax havens, the rich (especially corporations) often pay no taxes.

This is a huge problem in America.  You might have heard that we have a ""budget crisis.""  The crisis was entirely manufactured by Republicans.  The Bush tax cuts have cost the federal government more revenue than the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan plus much of our quasi-national-health system (for about 10 years) COMBINED.  Now, taking advantage of a tax cut is clearly legal, but when the ultra-rich end up paying no or almost no taxes, it seems to me like they are evading their fair share of the nation's burdens.  After all, they used our resources and legal system to get rich in the first place, and how can business continue to function if our education, health, and infrastructure are allowed to degrade because the government can't or won't properly invest in them?

At the other end, many lower-income workers also evade taxes.  This primarily occurs when people are mostly paid with tips (waiters, bartenders, strippers, valet parkers).  Though they are supposed to pay tax on these tips, and they have no way around it if they are tipped by credit card, cash tips can be pocketed without the government's knowledge.  This is a custom in America.

Businesses that hire illegal immigrants from Latin America also often pay no taxes on their labor and pay them below minimum wage; this happens in restaurants, agriculture, landscaping, factory work (especially slaughterhouses), moving (as in moving from one house to another), and construction.  In these cases, as you correctly pointed out, the businesses are at fault.  They want to avoid labor laws, though they rationalize what they do by saying that Americans wouldn't want to do the work or wouldn't work hard enough (translation: the jobs offer insufficient wages and we don't want to pay people properly).  Companies even send recruiters to Mexico to get laborers who will work for below minimum wage, though this may have ceased since Obama's severe crackdown on employers using illegal labor.",0,1337876913,null,0,1337877535,0,c4rv9rq,t3_u22i4,t1_c4rv9rq,t1_c4rr4mi,null,1428991805,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

It's obvious that the slave makes nothing (0) and the owner makes X. You might want to use the median or mod for this. 

It is purely internal matter of EU member states do they do wealth redistribution inside their society and on what scale. For example Nordic countries have quite large schemes to redistribute wealth between their citizens.

&gt; Imposed. Greeks voted for socialism, and got neolibaralism. Now we are voting for euro-communism (there has to be someone that has the guts to nationalise infrastructure ala Argentina). If this doesn't work, there are proper communists to vote for. 

The Greek people can vote for socialists, however that doesn't mean that the EU has an obligation to give bailout money for them if they oppose conditions attached to them. The Greek people can also choose to default their debts, that is their freedom, but again there is no obligation for the EU to make sure Greek businesses and banks won't go bankrupt.

The Greek state can also nationalize their infrastructure, but they have to pay a compensation to the owners of that infrastructure, if they don't, then they are braking EU regulations heavily. Actually I don't understand the point nationalizing infrastructure like for example electricity production or distribution networks, the Nordic countries have all that privatized for ages and the price of energy determined in an energy market, and still energy and energy transmission prices are on of the lowest in the EU.

Atwater released the notorious ""Willie Horton"" ad and devastated the public's perception of Dukakis' character.  Obama, Clinton, Dukakis, Carter: none of them are or were known for character assassination.

Your thing about Obama unfairly calling people ""racist"" is just a ""boo hoo we're the victims"" Fox News distraction.

true,Professor_ZombieKill,NETH,The Netherlands,"Well I see where we disagree. I believe quite strongly that if you are part of a (democratic) society. You bear a part of the responsibility for that society. After all, if no citizen is held accountable for what their government decides, than what is that government exactly? An empty shell, an entity that (in a regular free market) would not be able to borrow money from anyone. No civil responsibility means no government. 

Do not assume that I do not recognize the importance and impact of one's birthplace one one's life. But this is not something you can hold me accountable for as it was not my decision for anybody to be born. To mitigate such unfair (dis)advantages in my own country, I believe creating equal opportunities for all. In line with creating policy based on 'being behind a veil that hides in what sort of situation you will be born into' (e.g. child of rich parents or poor parents). In line with this reasoning, I support the distribution of EU money from richer countries to poorer countries to a certain extend.

One must recognize that the nations that make up the EU are still nations. The differences between the nations in terms of cultural/historic as well as social economic terms are just to great for a 'grand merger of nations' into a federation of the EU. Being born in the 'right' place is a thing of 'being lucky' for the person that is born. You cannot control it and only fools believe that worldwide (or even EU wide) equality can be achieved. There are too many factors in play that simply cannot be controlled by man.

So when a Greek is a Greek and its government has over-leveraged its position on the international loans market, than it *is* fair to keep them accountable. It is fair because now it is not their own money that they are using but it is mine and the money of other Europeans that had no influence over Greek governmental policies. The difference between me and a Greek person is that I am not part of Greek society and that person is. No matter how young this person is, if they are Greek they are accountable.

Perhaps you have a more Jeffersonian view in that you feel that the current generation (or the new generation in the case of Greece) should not be held accountable for the debts and crimes of our forfathers. But this view is not in practice nor is is practical in a society as we know it.

I think it is disingenuous to say that you choose either a European/altruist position or one of nationalist bigotry. This is a gross simplification of the choices that any political being has. Further more, when you say you can be an altruist, what you mean to say is that you can create monetary equality in the European Union, simply meaning: you can be a communist. Or a nationalist bigot (perhaps like a nazi?). I hope you understand that communism or socialism are the two most extreme parameters of a broad political spectrum. 

Having said everything above, let me clarify my own position once more. First, I believe that the nations that make up the EU cannot and never will be equal no matter what human interventions are implemented. Being born in a certain country or a certain town is something that is beyond anybody's control and you cannot hold anybody accountable for it except perhaps your own parents. Second, I believe that as a member of a society, you bear part responsibility for the actions and inactions of your own government. Even if you were not alive, I believe that you bear the responsibility over the debts and crimes of your forfathers as they have shaped the society that you were born in. This may sound cruel and unjust, but without responsibility and accountability there is no governance and there is only anarchy. Third, I believe in equal opportunity for all (as if you were to choose from behind the veil of birth), something that requires some wealth distribution. This can be achieved nationally by taxation, exemption and governance finance of certain programs. Political debate would be concerned with what programs and what conditions need to apply in order to create these equal opportunities. Internationally, it means the redistribution of wealth on a moderate, international scale (as has happened in the past with Greece and the rest of the EU). Finally, considering all the points above, I believe that the Greeks have made their beds and now have to lie in it. As Europeans we bear co-responsibility for letting the Greeks jeopardize the rest of the EU like this. This is why it is partly just that we help Greece now. However, Greece being a sovereign nation, it is ultimately Greece's (and all of Greece's citizens') responsibility to bear the pain that is needed to become an economically healthy nation once again.

This position does not make me an altruist nor does it make me a nationalist bigot. I hope the explanation above clarifies my earlier statement.",0,1337879358,null,0,false,0,c4rvu8n,t3_u2pe9,t1_c4rvu8n,t1_c4rv8fz,null,1428992139,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

&gt; Greek newspaper Vima has published an email sent by the Secretary General for Fiscal Policy Ilias Pentazos to ministers, in which details of urgent measures required by the Troika are contained. As well as suggestions of 100,000 job cuts in the public sector over the next two years, there are also demands for deeper pension cuts.

That was before ""Bailout 2.0"" or whatever the fuck they named it. The proposal made it in the final agreement and passed through Parliament. Dismissals should start in 1-2 months. Second newsflash, Oda_Krell. You don't have the money, you don't call the shots. That tells you a lot about the quality of the people you have to deal with.

The fucking Troika set a tight deadline about the reduction of the deficit. Everything must be squeezed through. They don't care what happens, they see numbers. Can't cut more? Well, tough luck, Zorba, start blindly to cut jobs. Because, Oda_Krell, Greece isn't even allowed to hire doctors and teachers. That was ""Bailout 1.0"". If 5 people go, then Greece is allowed to hire 1. ONE. Do you see where this fucking mess leads to? No fucking exemptions, doesn't matter if it's a hospital or a school. You need 1, 5 should go.

That's the whole deal about Greece's ""commitments"". What fucking commitments? Commit to suicide? ""But you signed your death certificate, please proceed with the pulling of the trigger.""

You don't know anything about the reality of the situation. You don't even question what you're being fed.

&gt;You don't really understand how the negotiations worked. Yet you talk about them.

The article you linked to doesn't really help much to understand the exact nature of the negotiations that took place either. It mentions an email by a Greek politician to the ministers. Doesn't give us much insight into how the talks that preceded that went.

Here's my understanding of how it worked: the ""troika"", i.e. EC, ECB, IMF and the Greek government agreed that Greece needed a bailout. EC, ECB, IMF made it clear that this will only work in return for budgetary concessions. Negotiations began on how to implement a budget reduction of X%. Presumably, the people involved had certain ""recipes"" in mind, that were used before, in particular the package that the IMF has administered in the past over and over again: cut your budget, reduce red tape, open the market. Neoliberal policies? Not sure. But certainly not exactly socialism either. I'm pretty sure the Greek bargaining position was hardly a strong one, since they were the ones who were running out of money, but I also stongly doubt the European/IMF side simply would have made a concrete demand and not allowed any Greek input -- think about it, why would the EU **benefit** from Greece suffering and not being able to return to economic prosperity? It doesn't make sense.

But okay, you can say this is details. What matters is that the common Greek people suffer. So what's your solution? Or would have been your solution back then? Bailout without any strings attached? And what about now? Say you're allowed to hire as before in the public sector. Then what? You go back to a big primary deficit. And how about stopping (or at least delaying) the payback of the debt. So another haircut. But then why only Greece? Why not also Portugal, Ireland and Italy? Okay, so now **all** European debt payments are postponed. Congratulations, your European financial market just crashed, utterly and thoroughly. I never claimed there's a simple solution (or that pure austerity is the only way to go). I just don't see how there can be any alternative to going back to public spending that is *sustainable* by Greece.

But the inevitable happened. Now Merkel can't sell an alternative plan to her conservative voters. She sticks with the old plan. Greeks are furious. Germans are also furious, for other reasons.
