* La journaliste qui a pondu cette pièce est une militante active LGBT et extrême-gauche (FdG).
* En tant que militant identitaire depuis 3 ans, on n'a jamais utilisé ces techniques ""secrètes"" (que tous les partis utilisent plus ou moins de toute façon) et encore moins de manière organisée.
* On ne sait pas qui est ce fameux anonyme qui témoigne, et personne ne correspond à ce profil chez nous, on n'a jamais entendu parler de ce mec chez les identitaires.
* Ces fameuses ""révélations"" n'en sont pas, ça dégouline des lieux communs habituels dans toutes les ""enquêtes"" sur la ""droite ultra"", il n'y aucune nouvelle information. Au mieux, c'est un témoignage bâclé d'un mec qui n'a jamais fait partie d'un mouvement, au pire c'est un fake complet réalisé à partir de résumés d'autres enquêtes et articles sur le sujet.

Maintenant, j'invite tout le monde à réfléchir à ces points, et ceux qui ne sont pas d'accord à en discuter tranquillement.

This is irrelevant. You don't understand how a state functions. Data do not materialize out of thin air.

A doctor has access to your medical records and can publish aggregate data about diseases. He gathers data *locally* but publishes *nationally*.

The classification is based solely on **memory bandwidth**. This bureucrats know nothing about graphics cards. There is **far** more to the graphics performance than that. This would simply force manufacturers to artificially limit memory bandwidth, and make it up with core frequencies. That is less efficient when it comes to performance / energy, but it conforms to the regulation. Even todays high-end 7000 series, the most efficient on the market, would not pass this stupid regulation, yet some less efficient older models would pass.

They ought to do it based on a correct measure, for example limiting gflops/watt similarly to car efficiency.

However I went to Aruba with a couple of others which technically is part of the Netherlands . Some other people from my school  went to Prague, London, some northern French city and so on.
We got funded about as much as the other people that went abroad and put in some of our own coin because...well it's Aruba and costs quite a bit more.

To be honest it was one of the most memorable experiences of my life and I'm so happy I got to do it.
Me and 2 others worked together to get some sites, database and stuff done for a few ngos, others worked on a network for a school, an other worked and wrote articles for a local newspaper.

I never really had anything to complain about but the paperwork (loots and looots of it) though I now think it was completely justified because our school got all that funding by presenting all the relations with foreign companies and businesses, proper insurances and loads of extra paperwork to the Erasmus council thingy and even then one of the internships didn't turn out that well. (No appropriate work for a few that arrived in Prague.)

So yeah. It was definitely worth it. They totally deserve the money and as I've heard the ones in more colder regions had a very good and also productive time as well.

1) I don't ever want to be in the EU so far that it's not possible for a future generation in the UK to leave, should they wish. This is my problem with the euro, once you're in it, it's almost impossible to leave because the economic consequences are so bad.

2) It seems obvious to me that power will continue to be centralised away from nation states towards the center of the EU. Many people seem not to care about this, apparently because they despise their own countries governments so much that they think it would be an improvement. See the various people on this subreddit who say things like ""Rather the EU than XX party"", isJohnny on this thread for instance, would prefer the EU to the Tory party who are currently in power in the UK. This to me is deluded, the nature of politics doesn't change, in the new Federal EU you'll always have the ""other party you hate"" in power but instead they'll be further away from you, less accountable to you and consist of people you have practically nothing in common with.


3) Britain is already a group of countries (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland) who exist in a Union (Scotland may go its own way, granted). If we join euroland, then in effect *Britain* itself dies, it's replaced by something else because we're then in a Union with the rest of the EU. Other countries I suspect don't have this problem (perhaps Belgium?) but it's a bit like saying to Germany ""the moment you join the federal eu, Germany as a country no longer exists, its constituent parts will still be there, but the country of ""Germany"" is dead"". That's not something you do lightly.

That last point is probably most important. I've tried to explain it before here but people seem not to understand it. I personally am proud of being ""British"", being ""British"" means something different to being ""English"" to me and were Britain to join a Federal EU, then ""Britain"" to me would no longer exist. Again people will jump in and tell me lots of reasons why this isn't so, but I'll repeat that *to me* it will no longer exist. I suspect a lot of my countrymen, whether consciously or subconsciously feel the same way which is why Britain is never going to join a Federal EU.

While waiting for the inevitable to happen, he meets a charming woman with similar profession at a pub nearby. They start to bond through their awkward positions, which makes things more complicated. At the same time two juveniles start a criminal joyride through the city and other hitmen are on their way.

The actions taken by those quirky characters lead into weird situations, affecting each others lives significantly. The film has lots of funny and thoughtful dialogues about life and its impacts, just like your typical Tarantino.

true,archibald_tuttle,null,null,"I'll try to outline the view of the parties on the topics you mentioned. As others have said before: Those are not the topics currently discussed in German politics. Feel also free to share your comments/corrections.

**austerity:** Basically all parties acknowledge that national debt is a problem (I don't know much about the stance on the situation in the Euro zone). The differences lies in the proposed solution: Basically all parties believe in a good economy. The **FDP** proposes deregulation: Help companies create jobs. Let the invisible forces of the market do their job. Help only those who are *really* not able to work. **Die Linke** would argue that redistribution of wealth (""tax the rich, tax big corporations"") creates demand and fixes the economy. The other parties (**CDU/CSU, SPD**, possibly **die Grünen** as well) have shown a similar stance somewhere in between, as the SPD made major cuts to the welfare state during the [Agenda 2010](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_2010) program. However, IMO the SPD wants to reclaim a more anti-corporate, pro welfare position in the upcoming election. The position of the **NPD** is ""get rid of the immigrants which are not used by our economy, don't pay any money to other EU countries"" in order to create a strong, national economy with enough jobs for everyone (Germans only, please).

**abortion**: AFAIK there is not much debate anymore on this topic. The NPD however wants a ban of abortions (I don't know if they would accept any exceptions). There may also be members in other parties which oppose abortion on religious grounds, but you don't hear about them.

**drugs**: There is a consensus about hard drugs: They should be banned. The NPD supports more severe punishment of drug related crimes. The following parties support a legalization of cannabis: Die Grünen, die Linke. The SPD seems to be divided on that topic, the general agreement is to not legalize cannabis, but to tolerate the use for medical reasons (possibly the compromise between more extreme positions on that topic).

**gay marriage**: The German ""Grundgesetz"" states that you can't discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. This is why Germany passed a law to create [same-sex unions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_Germany) with some differences to traditional marriages (mainly tax benefits in some states). Some parties think that those differences are discrimination and should go away (Grüne, Linke, SPD) where others think that ""only traditional marriages are families, and families should get extra benefits, so no benefits to same sex unions"" (CD/CSU, NPD). 

**immigration**: The immigration topic is actually two separate topics in Europe: there are your highly skilled people looking for a job and there are refugees which want to escape war, political prosecution or just shitty living conditions. **Die Linke** opposes the idea of ""utility"" of certain people and focuses international solidarity. Again, this is where the **NPD** thinks the opposite: they state that out of control immigration will endanger the cultural identity of the German people (they avoid using the terms ethnic or racial identity for obvious reasons), so they oppose immigration especially from ""foreign countries"". The other parties agree that Germany has to give shelter to refugees. The parties think however differently about the whole ""integration/adaption/multiculturalism"". As a rule of thumb **CDU/CSU** as well as the **SPD** would like immigrants to adapt to the German culture, whereas **die Grünen** think of a real ""melting pot"" as their ideal model. The **FDP** loves the idea of immigration of well trained employees (because it helps the economy).",0,1350324672,null,0,false,0,c6mu3xx,t3_11cdbh,t1_c6mu3xx,t3_11cdbh,null,1430154373,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

Which is probably true, and I think I even feel similar about being German as you say you feel about being British, i.e. it would certainly feel like a loss to me to see the ""German identity"" dissolve and become part of a new European identity.

That said however, at some point, our ancestors had a very similar situation when they created the current nation states. I guess for Great Britain, that point in time lies a bit further back than for Germany, but my sincere question still stands: what if the citizens of whatever tribe/kingdom/whatever-pre-nation-state-form-of-government-your-particular-country-hails-from would have thought the same as you do now?

true,yourslice,null,null,"&gt;Right now nobody is starving to death, correct?

The honest answer is we don't know.  It's impossible to say when people will begin starving to death.  What we do know is that Iran's currency has become the [least valued currency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_valued_currency_unit) in the world as a result of the sanctions.  Iran's population of 70 million depends on imports, including oil which they can't refine themselves despite sitting on top of the third largest reserves in the world.  

The price of staples like bread are skyrocketing and causing protests.  There are reports of patients with serious medical conditions such as cancer who are unable to get medicine due to sanctions.  It is quite likely that Iranians have already died.  

&gt;And regime change can only be accomplished by Iranian people themselves.

I would like nothing more than to see that.  The Iranians tried after their election back in 2009.  The green revolution was met with shocking violence from the government.  There are many people still in prisons, their only crime taking to the streets and protesting the fraudulent election results.  

&gt;What's your solution? I hope it's not lobbing missiles at every possible military target.

Absolutely not. I'm not calling for an attack on Iran, though I would probably prefer regime change over sanctions.  One would liberate the Iranian people, the other would starve them. 

But before sending in troops or using sanctions, we should really ask ourselves if Iran is truly close to having a weapon.  Despite propaganda in the news, all signs point to them being years away.  The next question is, would Iran use a nuke if they had it?  My personal opinion is that they absolutely would not.  Iran does not have a history of attacking other nations, and the mutually assured destruction would be a strong enough deterrent in my opinion.  Israel has nukes.  Europe has nukes.  The US has nukes.  Why would Iran dare use theirs with all of those nations willing and able to respond in kind?  I just don't see it happening.  

I would rather live in a nuclear bomb free world, but if countries like Pakistan and North Korea can have advanced weaponry, why should we kill off so many innocent Iranians to supposedly keep Iran from possibly developing one?

Germans ignored these advices, invested in industry, pirated books like hell ;), and became industrial powerhouse of Europe (another question is - how they used that power later).

I hate the Iranian government with a passion, but I understand the one thing they likely care about is maintaining power.  They know that if they nuke another country they will be wiped out.  I believe they are crazy but not that crazy.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;This is my problem with the euro, once you're in it, it's almost impossible to leave because the economic consequences are so bad.

Then don't leave the euro after you join it. That can be said about any currency - before you had the Pound Sterling you certainly had some other currency, going back to it now would also be harmful to the economy. The same thing happens with the euro, it's meant to be permanent, it's meant to deepen the single market and to make all EU economies more competitive because it limits trade barriers.

&gt;It seems obvious to me that power will continue to be centralised away from nation states towards the center of the EU.

Clearly impossible in a massive and so different continent. Not even in the USA or in Brazil where they're so much more homogeneous than us, they have centralisation of power, thinking it would even be possible with all these different languages and cultures, that's bloody insane.

&gt;EU. Many people seem not to care about this, apparently because they despise their own countries governments so much that they think it would be an improvement. See the various people on this subreddit who say things like ""Rather the EU than XX party"", isJohnny on this thread for instance, would prefer the EU to the Tory party who are currently in power in the UK.

I'm sure he only disagrees with them because of their position EU-wise and because he doesn't like seeing the UK drifting from the EU in international affairs. The way you're talking, it's as if the EU even wanted to be involved in national or local politics. No, a stronger EU wouldn't give two shits about localised government, they just want more efficiency and a clearer response on a global level.

&gt;Britain is already a group of countries (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland) who exist in a Union (Scotland may go its own way, granted). If we join euroland, then in effect Britain itself dies, it's replaced by something else because we're then in a Union with the rest of the EU.

The city of London is part of the metropolitan area of London which is part of England which part of the UK. A city within a city within a country within a country. Chances are, another layer of countries on top won't change anything else under it.

What a ridiculous claim, ""oh, the EU means there's no countries"". That's like Germany destroyed Bavaria or that the UK itself destroyed Scotland.

&gt;I personally am proud of being ""British"", being ""British"" means something different to being ""English"" to me and were Britain to join a Federal EU, then ""Britain"" to me would no longer exist.

So it's about silly nationalistic pride. Whatever floats your boat, dude, but it's still silly to assume that they're incompatible. Being English doesn't prevent anyone from saying he's from Manchester, being British doesn't prevent anyone from saying he's from Scotland and being European will not prevent anyone to say he's British.",0,1350327992,null,0,false,0,c6mv46i,t3_11ieey,t1_c6mv46i,t1_c6mtihj,null,1430154845,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

So while the English and French man actually refer to differences between expected and actual pronouncation of the written language the German refers not to pronouncation but using different words. and that's the joke.

one reason why you might not understand it is that English language natives usually have very little understanding of the fact that there are actual phonetic values associated to latin vocals, which are completely ignored in English :).

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Blair / Brown Labour? Sure. I'm not so certain about the new Labour leadership though.

The leadership may change but that's not exactly helpful if I disagree with their core values and policies. Considering that I'm against a lot of government intervention in the economy and the policies of mindless wealth redistribution, I wouldn't see me voting Labour if I was a British citizen.

&gt;You're bang on the money about the First Past the Post system though. I'd totally vote for Green (since I agree with them the most) but because of gerrymandering, I'd be throwing my vote away if I didn't select either Labour or Tory.

&gt;We need to change the voting system. Not to AV, to full Proportional Representation. 

This is an serious issue, the quality of the democracy can be immensely hurt - I also am strongly against having to vote against the parties I don't like rather than in the parties I associate myself with.

Here in Portugal there's the D'Hondt method of proportional representation, but there's still several situations where there's hardly any perfect choice - you know, the typical social-democrat social-liberal parties vs the fiscal-conservative social-conservative parties where guys like me are in between because I may favour the economic policies of one but the civil policies of the other.

And then there's the actual policies being implemented - here we ended up with 5 big parties in the Assembly of the Republic, 2 of them in power ruling in coalition and the other 3 in the opposition, and all of them support the increase in the tax rates - the opposition because of their ideology and the ruling parties because of the public debt and the troika and whatnot. All this to say that there's no perfect method and you can always end up with no party representing your views on such an important issue like if we should raise or lower taxes.

&gt;Well not Portugal (since we have the longest lasting alliance in the world, bros fo life yo)

Pauls Mutter wusste nicht, dass ihr Sohn ständig schikaniert wurde.

Er fand ein altes Buch, bei dem es sich um ein Tagebuch zu handeln schien. 
Er fragte seine MUtter, wem es gehörte und sie erklärte ihm, dass es seinem Vater gehört hatte. 
Dann verbrachte er einige Zeit damit, das Tagebuch zu lesen. 
Während des Lesens verstand er, was für ein mutiger Soldat sein Vater gewesen war. 
Er war die Art von Soldat, der niemals einen Freund zurücklassen würde. 
Er missachtete manchmal sogar Befehle, um seinen verwundeten Freunden helfen zu können. 
Am Ende des Tagebuchs hatte sein Vater einige Zeilen über Paul geschrieben. 
""...und ich glaube, dass mein Sohn Paul ein starker Junge werden und die beschützen wird, die er liebt.""
Nachdem er in dem Tagebuch gelesen hatte, dachte Paul eine Zeit lang nach.  
Am folgenden Tag tat Paul etwas gegen die Schikane.
Er erzählte seinem Lieblingslehrer/Klassenlehrer (?) davon und so einfach ärgerte ihn danach nie wieder jemand. 
Einige Zeit verging und ein neuer Schüler kam in seine Klasse. 
Sein Name war Florian. Florian war wie Paul und so wurde auch er schikaniert. 
Als Paul sah, wie Florian (von Ryan) geärgert wurde, stand er auf und haute Ryan ins Gesicht. 
Paul fühlte sich gut, seinem Freund beigestanden zu haben, so wie sein Vater es getan hätte. 
Natürlich wurde er danach auch verprügelt, aber das war es ihm wert. Danach wurden Florian und er gute Freunde.

Of course, even as its role as a check and balance the EuroParl has made the EU more democratic, but consequentially it has also caused complacency in many of the EU's supporters and the perception of some that such a democratic deficit doesn't exist, reducing the likelihood that the problem will ever be addressed correctly.

Additionally, the lack of power of the EuroParl has caused voters (at least here in the UK) to not take the elections as seriously as general or local elections and as such turnout is low, again raising the question of democratic deficit.

Frankly, it needs reform, the current transitional state is unhealthy for the EU as a whole and I believe it is the primary reason why parties like UKIP have convinced such a huge proportion of the UK electorate that it would be better to leave the EU.

Wages collapsed, in west Lothian there were mass lay offs and weretaken back on as 0 hour contracts.men in building trades went from making 20k to 16 for more hours.  I suppose thats just fantastic as long as companies make more profit and you are not affected.  

There were scots all throughout scotland working in shops and hotels before the poles arrived. I do not understand how people can lament poor unliveable wages and applaud huge immigration saying nobody was prepared to do it. They were doing it for decades.

There are now shortages in trades as noone bothered their arse to train our own yoof when there was cheap cash in hand labourer by the barrel load, they made out like bandits and fucked off home when the going was not so good.

Iran doesn't want its population to starve per se.  In fact, the Iranian government has long given the poor subsidized bread.  What I did say was that they care more about their power and sticking to their desires than backing down so as to keep their people from starving.  They will blame that on the west rather themselves.  They will be only partially correct in doing so.  

&gt;Not to mention nothing inspires trust and screams rationality like a mullah-ruled islamist theocracy.

I despise the Iranian government and I am not here to defend them or insist that they are completely rational.  I am willing to point out that history shows they are not suicidal.  

&gt;If I were a Jew living in Israel, a country Iran threatens to wipe off the map, I would feel really reassured right now, wouldn't I?

First, you should look into that ""wipe Israel off the map"" quote as he was mistranslated and absolutely never said that.  The media sure loves repeating the mistranslated quote though.  Secondly, the majority of Israelis do not want attack Iran according to recent surveys.  While I understand their apprehension about Iran having a weapon, they are arguably the only nation justified in doing something about it and yet their population does that have the desire to take action at this time.  Why should the rest of the world?

&gt;They use their proxy armies for that, cough cough Hizbollah.

Much like the US, Europe, Russia and other nations, they do arm foreign soldiers for causes they feel are worthy.  The Iranian government has never directly attacked any of its neighbors.

A better alternative to what?  You are suggesting the killing of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iranians now because MAYBE in the future Iran MIGHT get a weapon and they MIGHT use it against another nation.  Yes, I think diplomacy and a possible arms race with the chance of a revolution in Iran someday is a far better alternative to killing hundreds of thousands of innocents now.

Because nuclear fallout doesn't know borders.

Iran has much more control than that, Hezbollah doesn't act without Iran's blessing.

&gt; The Iranian government has never directly attacked any of its neighbors. 

 Sure about that? How about the Iran-Iraq war:

&gt; The Ayatollah Khomeini [...] was determined to extend his revolution across the Islamic world, starting with Iraq.  By late 1979, Tehran was pushing hard to get the Kurdish and Shi’ite populations in Iraq to revolt and topple Saddam, and Iranian operatives were actively trying to assassinate senior Iraqi officials.  Border clashes became increasingly frequent by April 1980, largely at Iran’s instigation.

That makes as much sense as claiming you're murderer if you saw someone drowning and didn't save him. Again, is it  the West's responsability to feed the Iranians?

true,XianaGF,null,null,"Hi,

I'm from Spain. The university access system has been undergoing some reforms and I've been abroad since 2007, so I'm not sure about the details. Just a few things:

1) Do you speak Spanish? How fluent are you? How fast are you at learning languages? Because really, you **will** need it.

2) Are you aware that some parts of Spain have co-official languages **besides** Spanish? In Galicia they speak Galician; in Cataluña, Comunidad Valenciana and Islas Baleares they speak different kinds of Catalan; in Euskadi they speak Basque. When looking into universities in those places, be aware that, in most cases, they will offer some courses in those languages ONLY. So, unless you're willing to learn the local language, don't even think about going there. Like seriously. Unless you know for sure they only teach in Spanish. HINT: if the website of a given university has both Spanish and a co-official language, you can safely assume they'll be teaching in both languages. The actual weight of each language in teaching will vary, you have to find out individually.

3) Actually, the way of accessing university is pretty straightforward, paperwork aside. **If you're from Spain**, you just get an ""access grade"" that is a combination of your bachillerato (=last two years of high school) grade and your selectividad (=SAT/ACT/etc, only carried out by the government and you only get to take it either in June or September) grade. Then you just fill out some paperwork and say which universities and majors you like (you can't just apply to any major, it depends on what kind of bachillerato you did). And then if, say, there's 50 spots for that major in that university and you placed 50th or higher you're in. Please note that this ranking is based on your ""access grade"" alone. No application essays, not extracurriculars, no nothing.

4) Now, that's how it goes for people who finish high school in Spain. The main idea (you get in based solely on your ""access grade"") is, as far as I know, also true for you. I have no idea what kind of paperwork you actually have to fill out for that. Sorry, I can't help you with the critical part.

5) You'll also need to get some kind of student visa; again, no idea how that works.

6) Be prepared for a VERY different student culture. That could be a good or a bad thing for you, it depends. But you can be very sure: you'll have much less flexibility that you're used to in the US. As in, you only really study stuff in your major and you don't really get to pick any electives until your 3rd or 4th year.

7) Whether you trust university rankings or not, [you can look at this one](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/) to see where they put Spanish universities. 

8) Key words for looking up education programs: ""pedagogía"" and ""educación"". The latter usually accompanied by some kind of modifier: ""educación infantil"", ""educación especial"". I actually have no idea what you do in these.

It is absolutely not the responsibility of the outside world to feed the Iranian people, but it's immoral to create laws that will lead to the starvation of hundreds of thousands of people.  If you live in the US and your mother lives in Iran, you can't send money to your mother right now because of sanctions.  If she's starving, you can't feed your own mother.  How would you feel if that were your mother?

&gt;Blame Iran then, it appeared on an official Iranian site.

That's the first I've heard that, and I would love to see a citation.  The quote came from a speech which was translated into English and I'm quote sure the quote wasn't first translated by an official Iranian site.  If you can show me otherwise, I would appreciate it.  Nevertheless, he did not say that, so it doesn't matter who translated it incorrectly.  

&gt;Sure about that? How about the Iran-Iraq war:

Yes, I am certain Iraq started the war, despite previous tensions.  

&gt;Honestly, I don't want to find out.

So your answer is to kill hundreds of thousands of innocents.  I hope you can admit this to yourself.  

&gt;That makes as much sense as claiming you're murderer if you saw someone drowning and didn't save him.

It's more like seeing a person who can't swim and purposely creating conditions so that the person falls into the water.  

&gt;Again, is it the West's responsability to feed the Iranians?

No, we should not feed them, but sanctions will force them to starve.  What would you say if you lived in Tehran, couldn't leave, hated your government and the world was doing this to you?

Wikipedia is your friend:

Many news sources repeated the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting statement by Ahmadinejad that ""Israel must be wiped off the map"",[80][81] an English idiom which means to ""cause a place to stop existing"",[82] or to ""obliterate totally"",[83] or ""destroy completely"".[84]

The Iranian presidential website stated that ""the Zionist Regime of Israel faces a deadend and will under God's grace be wiped off the map,"" and ""the Zionist Regime that is a usurper and illegitimate regime and a cancerous tumor should be wiped off the map.

&gt; Yes, I am certain Iraq started the war, despite previous tensions.

I used to work in study abroad in Spain and have looked at the process of Americans enrolling - so I know some (from 2008-2009). You must take the entrance exam in order to attend uni there. This is similar to our SATs. However, depending on what you get in that exam, that is what you can study. Top scores can get into better degree programs. It's not like the states where you get to choose which school and study whatever. (They have some choice - but not as much as US).

Since it seems you are not fluent this is my advice. Look for a private Spanish uni that is in English (I think Madrid has some). Go there, if you really want to study all of your undergrad in Spain. If not, go to any uni in the states with exchange programs to Spain. They have year long programs that you can do. 

As for career prospects in order to work at a public school and teach English there you need to go through ""oposiciones"". These are more exams that are extremely hard and even if you pass you are not guaranteed placement. So - I would recommended working for private schools and the like.

Also, after graduating or your last year at a US uni, you can qualify to be an English Assistant. This is a government program that last for one school year. It can be repeated for up to 3 times. It is a paid position. I have had several of my former study abroad students do this since they wanted to come back to Spain. They all loved it.

Where you can read:
&gt; In January, prodded in part by outrage over a series of articles in the New York Review of Books, the Justice Department finally released an estimate of the prevalence of sexual abuse in penitentiaries. The reliance on filed complaints appeared to understate the problem. For 2008, for example, the government had previously tallied 935 confirmed instances of sexual abuse. After asking around, and performing some calculations, the Justice Department came up with a new number: 216,000. That’s 216,000 victims, not instances. These victims are often assaulted multiple times over the course of the year. The Justice Department now seems to be saying that prison rape accounted for the majority of all rapes committed in the US in 2008, likely making the United States the first country in the history of the world to count more rapes for men than for women.

&gt; On top of that, energy efficiency should always be a goal. Not only will this generate less heat (meaning it needs less cooling -&gt; more durability and quieter fans), but your energy bill will also be lower.

Yes, but my bills are my bills. If I want to have a supercomputer then it's up to me. I could use a 1000W PSU and run several 200W graphics cards in parallel if I want to. It's up to me because I pay my own bills.

&gt; at the rate that the global power usage is growing, we seriously need more energy efficiency if we don't want wars started over electricity.

&gt;It took me quite a bit of study to get an informed (as much as a layman can have) opinion on nuclear, study I'm willing to bet most of the popular masses did not do, and even I do not feel qualified to be voting for this, as there are factors in this decision I do not yet know how to evaluate such as population density near the plant (more is better), electricity you will lose in transport, effects of the extra heat on the river you use for cooling, etc. 

You're saying that people can't decide for themselves in these complicated issues and you're implying that our representatives will somehow know best than the rest of us. That's utter nonsense.

&gt;In short, technical and scientific decisions should definitely not go to a referendum. They should be made by experts in the field or representatives advised by teams of experts. 

Yeah, I'm not against experts deciding what should be the best course of action, what I'm against is they deciding over and against the popular vote, as if the average voter didn't know what's best of him and can't take responsibility for their poor choices.

That can be a slippery slope, if the people don't know what's best for them with regards to energy, what do they know? I mean, why not abolish all democratic institutions and let experts and technocrats rule over everything?

Democracy must be used to make decisions, not to justify decisions. You can't force anything (not even nuclear power) on people and if the people agree everything is fine but if the people disagree you do it either way and continue to do referendums till they accept and you justify your decision with the public vote. That's not being supportive of democracy, that's justifying your own goals by saying they're what the people want.

Here, let me restore your faith with democracy:

&gt;[Nuclear Power in Switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Switzerland#Politics)

&gt;In Switzerland there have been many referenda on the topic of nuclear energy, beginning in 1979 with a citizens' initiative for nuclear safety, which was rejected. In 1984, there was a vote on an initiative ""for a future without further nuclear power stations"" with the result being a 55 to 45% vote against. On September 23, 1990 Switzerland had two more referenda about nuclear power. The initiative ""stop the construction of nuclear power stations,"" which proposed a ten-year moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants, was passed with 54.5% to 45.5%. The initiative for a phase-out was rejected with by 53% to 47.1%. In 2000 there was a vote on a Green Tax for support of solar energy. It was rejected by 67% to 31%.
&gt;
&gt;On May 18, 2003, there were two referenda: ""Electricity without Nuclear,"" asking for a decision on a nuclear power phase-out, and ""Moratorium Plus,"" for an extension of the earlier decided moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants. Both were turned down. The results were: Moratorium Plus: 41.6% Yes, 58.4% No; Electricity without Nuclear: 33.7% Yes, 66.3% No.",0,1350381483,null,0,false,0,c6n79t0,t3_11ihrp,t1_c6n79t0,t1_c6n70nq,null,1435677850,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

First of all, Spanish University.system is much much different than in the US. There isn't such a ""Harvard"" equivalent, Spanish universities are pretty much the same and people in Spain usually study in the nearest one. When looking for a job is not so important in which university you graduated.
Also, programs are more closed and defined than in the US. Each degree has 80% of mandatory subjects, and the ones you can choose must be related to your degree, so differences between universities fade more.
You can study Primary Education degree (Magisterio en Educacion Primaria) in almost every university in Spain, so that wouldn't be a problem. In fact, is a little bit underrated and everyone with a grade of 5/10 can get into).
As has been said, take good care of the local language, because Magisterio is teached in Catalan, Gallego and Euskera in those regions. Be prepared for the paperwork, that's very important. I have no idea of what is, but prepare yourself to a lobg fight against Spanish burocracy.

true,Quazz,BELG,Belgium,"&gt;What a substanceless argument. If population rises, which it does, and if electricity supply stays the same, which is what you're proposing, then the supply of electricity per person becomes restricted and prices rise. This is called supply and demand - it's a very basic concept.

Except that isn't what is happening. Nor what I'm proposing.

Trying to save what energy we can, doesn't mean HOLD ALL YOUR HORSES. It simply means you use what you use in a more EFFICIENT way. I'm going to start writing all that in caps since you seem to keep on missing that part.

Increasing the efficiency, means we won't need to use as much electricity and therefore resources. I don't see how you could possibly oppose this as it requires 0 effort from your end and it benefits the entire planet.

&gt;Oil is not usually used for electricity supply. No one here is talking about about oil. I'm not sure why you're bringing it up.

It is for heating, which is what you were suddenly harping on about.

&gt;Uranium is not the sole source for fission. As I said above, new techniques and technologies are in development all the time.

It's the only one worthwhile, currently. Whatever potential there may be in the future, it's irrelevant to our situation. What if we continue to use up like we are and then it turns out the new tech is delayed with another 10 years? Still think it's a good idea? It's too slippery a slope and it's not worth it.

&gt;That wasn't the point. The point is that I can run whatever I like on my own PC in my own house. You're not paying my bills, so you get no say in what I run.

And you get no say in what energy restrictions governments put up.

This argument is pointless.

&gt;I'm not sure you've managed to grasp the difference between electricity and resources.

You realize they use resources to generate electricity right? If not, then you're the one who doesn't know the difference, unfortunately. If you do, then please elaborate on how this is incorrect.

&gt;Besides, we're estimated to have at least 200 years worth of Uranium supply. At this time people are working on Thorium reactors, which is even more abundant than uranium and new techniques for extracting uranium increase the possible supply of that resource as well.

Yet we'd be stuck with all the radioactive waste, not exactly the most attractive  solution out there. Plus, building new nuclear plants is generally not approved by the general public and pretty expensive too. Naturally, new plants are necessary from time to time, but when it can be avoided, it should be attempted.

&gt;Given that there are all these technologies in development, I don't think that your utterly unfounded hypothesis of global war for electricity is going to happen. Sorry.

It's not my hypothesis at all, it's my hypothesis in the ridiculous situation you sketched.

&gt;This is entirely a subjective argument. What risks are you talking about? Do you even know? Do you have any evidence other than what you fail to see?


Running out of valuable resources used in a multitude of fields. OIl is used for so many applications that we can't afford to run out of it this soon. 

And also the possibility that we won't have the resources necessary to produce enough electricity before better ways arrive.

And pollution of course.

&gt;I strongly doubt it. In fact, I'm done listening to your ignorant and substanceless arguments. You have no evidence and your arguments are simply emotive rants. I'm finishing this before you post a reply all in caps.

Of course, if you go into the direction of electronic music you can find quite a lot of interesting instrumental stuff from Germany, for example:

true,TarantusaurusRex,null,null,"I'm an American that lived in Paris for one year, and I didn't learn any French.  I had some very basic knowledge, like ""bonjour"", ""au revoir"", and how to ask simple questions while shopping or visiting the bakery. It's a multicultural city and a lot of people speak English, even when you don't want to.  It is easy to scrape by with no French language skills, but it's also embarrassing, frustrating, and at times downright excruciating. I have now enrolled in language courses. 

If you decide to make the move, enroll in language courses and make friends with French-speakers, or you'll find yourself sitting in your apartment and not wanting to go out. If you are NOT passionate about learning French, then you WILL be miserable. 

Also, consider how much time you've spent in Paris in the past.  Was it a short vacation?  Did your stay last a few months?  Paris can be a cold, hard city to foreigners, and it is VERY common for people to move there with romantic ideas about Parisian life, only to have those ideas completely slaughtered. You are from a large city, so maybe you are interested in it for that reason, but Paris is different from LA.  I would say it's much closer to New York: fast, busy, grey. I repeat: GREY.  LA is a land of abundant sunshine. Paris gets grey.  More grey than you could ever imagine.  Come winter, you'll see shades of grey that you never knew existed.  The buildings are grey, the sky is grey, the people are all dressed in black, and it can feel really morose for someone who requires sunshine in order to be happy (like me). 

Also, LA is a vast city, it's so massive in terms of size.  Paris is not so expansive, yet it has a tremendous population.  LA's population density is only 8,092.30/sq mi , whereas Paris' population density is around 54,900/sq mi.  Go ahead, read that again.  You've got time.  Even New York City comes in at 27,243.06/sq mi.  If you don't mind climbing all over people to go anywhere at any time of day or night, then Paris is great for you.

If you can come to terms with what Paris is truly like, and that it's not only a magical kingdom of tasty pastries and romance, then you will enjoy it.  But do be careful not to arrive with any ideas about how it's going to be.  I love Paris, I'm going to *visit* again soon now that I live in Lyon, but I also hated Paris for a long time.

Also, might I recommend that you research Lyon?",0,1350388482,null,0,false,0,c6n7z0q,t3_11k255,t1_c6n7z0q,t3_11k255,null,1430161046,12,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,12

First of all: one cannot prove a negative - as nonexistence of something (try disproving [Russels Teapot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot)). Believing that something exists just because there is no proof of it's nonexistence is not rational. Instead the existence of something is provable by providing adequate evidence to support it.

With that in mind read Nordichardware's blogpost. Does it provide the evidence to support it's claims? Nope.

1. The blogpost claims ""exclusive information"" but their source is a preliminary study which has been freely available since 2007. That's hardly ""exclusive"".

2. The study in question concerns voluntary energy labels (such as Energy Star). A voluntary label does not ""cripple"" any hardware or in any way prevent manufacturers from improving their products.

3. The study in question is from 2007! It's over five years old. It's outdated. It's categories are not relevant any more.

4. There is no such directive or proposal that Nordichardware is claiming. And if there was then I would ask for the evidence of it's existence before believing it. The article does not provide any evidence or source for that, just an years ago outdated preliminary study which fails as evidence.

Mentioning Plaid Cymru, they indirectly have a say in Labour or Tory policy because these parties know that if they want that Welsh vote that they need they have to adopt some of Plaid Cymrus ideas or they will lose seats to them, if something is so important in those constituencies.

It is possible to complete your degree completely at their Madrid campus, but has the benefit of being run like a mostly American University (i.e., they know what SAT scores, most classes are offered in English, are and there is more flexibility in choosing your own major). I would recommend you look into this and other similar options.

When the people are saying you must be fluent in Spanish, they do not just mean that you need to be able to speak and read it. You must be academically fluent. If you could not read an academic journal article in Spanish and understand at the very least 95% of it, then you probably do not speak Spanish well enough to study full time at a Spanish University. To give you an idea, it usually takes about 8-10 years of diligent study to become academically fluent in a language, whereas conversational fluency can take as few as 1 year or as many as 5.

Additionally, as others have said, becoming a teacher for the public school system is quite difficult here, especially now that the Crisis has forced most regions to cut jobs and increase classroom sizes. Why have you picked Spain to teach in? Why did you decide you want to teach? These are all important questions you should ask yourself before committing to this course of action.

As one other poster has mentioned, there is a program run by the Spanish government that allows you to be an assistant English teacher for between 2-3 years. The salary is fairly good and the work schedule is rather light (18~ hours per week). However, this does not require a degree from a Spanish University and (I believe) they prefer individuals who have studied in an English Speaking university. The program is known as the auxiliaries de conversacion program if you would like more information about it.

Unstrittig ist ja eigentlich, daß Leute totprügeln ein krankhaftes Verhalten ist. Ähnlich wie zum Beispiel Psychosen. Der Unterschied ist, daß ich mit einer Psychose früher oder später automatisch im medizinischen Netz lande, ganz unabhängig von meinen Taten. Wenn ich dagegen Probleme hab, meine Aggressionen zu kontrollieren, lande ich früher oder später im Gefängnis. Dabei sind Verhaltensstörungen wahrscheinlich weitaus billiger und nachhaltiger therapierbar. Aber der Patient ist halt weniger offensichtlich krank und es ist so viel einfacher, seinen Rachegelüsten nachzugeben als sich in Andere reinzuversetzen.

If Belgium were to split up today, it is likely that Wallonia will give up any union with Brussels, simply because they can't afford it. In Flanders, the political parties will have to choose sides: One side will fight to keep Brussels, the other side will promote abandoning it all together for a new capital: Antwerp most likely. It will mostly be an emotional debate so it is impossible to predict which way it would go. If Flanders does decide to give up Brussels, it is likely the EU would have to step in and finance Brussels as a nation state.

Personally, if I had to vote on the matter, I would favor keeping Brussels for Flanders rather than giving it away to Europe.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; The influx of PASOK's drones into SYRIZA's realm destroyed any remnants of credibility for some media, and this is reflected in their over the top reporting, which unfortunately influences many people.

I like how you blame me for veiled insults but then you insult my intelligence by implying that a. I used to be a PASOK drone and b. that I am a Syriza supporter now, c. that I don't have the capacity to judge the biases of the media. 

I completely disagree with your assessment of the situation, that this era is completely different than the Civil War. Old grudges remain the same, people have not moved on yet. If you think that the scars have healed it is my opinion that you are mistaken. GD are fascists and they are trying to replicate what Hitler did and worst of all they have a non-zero chance of success. Greece has a history with totalitarianism and this is reflected in our history books, in the demeanour of people, in the underlying system behind the semblance of democracy. Your ""everything is okay"" attitude reminds me of those Jews who didn't run away after Hitler was elected and started making his ideas a reality.

&gt; This is irrelevant. You don't understand how a state functions. Data do not materialize out of thin air. The state's institutions have access to your personal data, but there are limits as to what the state can publish. That is the scope of the laws protecting them. A doctor has access to your medical records and can publish aggregate data about diseases. He gathers data locally but publishes nationally. There is nothing wrong with that, it is perfectly reasonable and perfectly legal.

I'm not sure if doctors are allowed to do this in the way you mention. Even if it is allowed, it probably [has to do with how the data is anonymised](http://elawyer.blogspot.com/2012/10/blog-post.html). The problem has to do with which points are able to deduce personal information. In the case of the kindergartens, the ministry would have a list of all kindergartens and for each kindergarten they would have the breakdown by nationality. 

&gt; Two can play the game of veiled insults.

Actually I was being serious. I feel that if we can discuss this we can resolve it.

&gt; In the case of Iran, we can, with a little empathy, understand that nuclear arms isn't Iran's goal, 

Obviously, when were nuclear weapons anything else but a tool?

&gt; it's method to the goal of having an equal position in negotiations with the USA/Israel 

I don't think that's desirable in the same way having North Korea on an equal footing with US is not something I would fancy.

Yes, but does Obama literally believes that Iran is the spawn of hell?

true,expendable_asset,null,null,"I'm sorry mate, but you are talking out the sour end of your nordic arse! Do you even have the first clue as to what caused the ""huge property bubbles"" that you seem so fond of? Hmmm? Do ya? Well let me tell you a little story, i'm not going to start at the beginning, because that goes back to 1939, and im sure that you, as a fin, are well aware of it already. How about we skip forward to german reunification? Germany needs low interest rates, cheap cash, and lots of it. At the same time, countries like Ireland, or even Spain, well they are doing quite well for themselves, and the *last thing* their economies need is low interest rates, and tonnes of cheap cash. Its got to do with overheating an economy, look it up, educate yourself by all means. Now lets look at the launch of the euro and the eurozone. How is Ireland looking, well its doing quite well, and its managing fairly well to keep things under control, primarily because it controls its own currency. Enter the euro, and like throwing liquid oxygen on an already well-stoked fire, the whole thing explodes, and because Ireland is no longer in control of it currency or interest rates (this is ceded to germany by the way in 2002, let me just say that again, Ireland cedes the most valuable tool for controlling over burn in its economy to germany in 2002) it cannot combat the ensuing ""bubble"" you like to refer to. What does germany do with this new and important responsibility? does it try and help ireland in some way? Fuck no, it not only lends, it actively shoves euros down Irish bank-ceo's throats, and tell them to lend lend lend (this is so people will also buy plenty of VWs BMW's, Nokia's, Merc's etc, thus also helping germany et al), at rates which actually are loss making for the banks. It starts off with one bad-apple, Anglo-Irish Bank, and when the other banks realise all their customers are leaving them for the Likes of anglo and the new British and european banks which have entered our market, they have to follow suit, or go out of business (its a gun to their head). By around 2004, banks are in a race to throw out as much cash as they can, in order to gain ""projected income"" forecasts (this is called speculation). This sends the property market into low earth orbit, and an average 2 bedroom semi-detached shithole of a house in a bad area, which 4 years previously wouldn't go for 50K is now being sold for 250K plus. 

Im gonna take a quick ""reality check"" break here for ya, and i want you to put yourself in the shoes of a young 20-something, with a wife/husband, expecting your first kid, and needs to get a house in Ireland in 2004. Do you want to take out a mortgage for 250K plus to buy a house worth 50K that you don't even want to live in for the rest of your lives? no, but if you don't, you, your wife and baby are going to be homeless very soon, and every day you wait, the price goes up about 1-2K. (Again, its like a gun to your head!)

Now back to our main story! Once the rest of europe sees how much property and everything in general is going up in price in Ireland, they decide this is a good way to make a quick buck. Hence we have an influx of european-wide cashflow into the country (for the sole purposes of speculation/gambling to get a quick return) which further drives the economy crazy. By now it has left the gravitational pull of the earth. Around 2005-early 2006 expect to pay 350-450k for that same 50k house. Let me remind you also, that this isnt a case where Irish people were building themselves mansions like you see on MTV cribs, if anything, the standard of housing is actually plummeting due to the increase of speculatory ""developers"" who couldn't put a leggo set together. However, the poor Irish citizen is actually paying more for less. And by the way, the price of average everyday items are all going through the roof also, and for all the pay increments, they just cant keep up with the cost of living. 

And what was germany, and all the rest of europe doing whilst all this was happening? They were speculating like crazy, lending money to Irish banks, hedge funds, pension funds, you name it, they were buying bonds, they were making huge returns, based on the rising cost of living in ireland. Its all good as long as the money we are lending the Irish is being spent on our exports, and being borrowed from banks in which we hold a stake.

Then it all goes bust.

What to do? what to do? The emperor has no clothes, what to do?

Well according to you, Ireland could have let its banks go under, i mean that's what you just said. We had no obligation to bail them out, thats what you said afterwards. Guess what, you are correct! But thats not what happened is it? 
Im going to let you in on a little secret now, thatyou obviously arent aware of yet....If you think, for one split second, that a single Irish Citizen wanted to bail out banks, if you think that we all sat down, and decided ""right lads, we've had a think about it, and even though we arent obligated to bail anyone out, or intervene in the banks going bust, but we are going to do it anyway!""............. if you think, for one second that so much as one Irish citizen said OK! ....... Then you, my sir.... are on crack-cocaine or crystal meth or both.

You want to know what happened? Irish people came home from work one evening, and there was a lot of talk on the news about some of the banks being in trouble, we woke up the next morning and heard a guy tell us in the past-tense, that we had all signed up to secure a shitload of *private* debt, in order to stop our banks from failing, in order to stop the ATM machines from running dry and the earth opening up and swallowing us all. (It was like a gun was put to our heads). No-one was consulted, no-one was asked, this shit was just foisted upon us. 

But according to you it was the ""Irish state"", that made the decision, i.e. they agreed to it (i assume you mean our elected representatives). Well you see, that's called making a decision under duress, and in general, any decision made under duress, isn't really a free choice. Thats why, even though they were under no-obligation, they went ahead and did it anyway, because, as you might say, even they had a gun to their heads. You see its strange the decisions human beings make when they have a gun to their head. Who was holding the gun? well there were many holders, and unfortunately, even though the Irish citizens are now repaying them, we are not entitled to know who they are.

Who has benefited from the bailouts? Well you remember those german banks, and those speculators from all over europe, those pension funds and the hedge funds, well, they certainly haven't done badly out of it. They gambled and lost, big time, but now the Irish people are paying for their irresponsibility.

The Irish people? Well, they aren't doing so good. You remember that guy who bought the 250K house. Well now he and his wife are out of work, expecting their next kid, and guess what, their house is worth 50K again, but their mortgage is still 250K and growing due to the rise in interest rates. There are some people that made truck-loads of cash, but the vast majority of Irish people didn't, and now they are paying for private debt, belonging to all of europe. So pardon me if i just correct your last point that ""now the Irish people need to be bailed out"". The Irish people have been bailing out the rest of europe since 2007/8.

The funny thing about it is, now there's no-one left to buy nokia's and BMW's, and guess whats coming down the road in Finland and Germany? Take a wild guess....",0,1350408024,null,0,1350415008,0,c6ncc1v,t3_113pzt,t1_c6ncc1v,t1_c6jinap,null,1430163157,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

It's more like ""keep calm and carry on"", because ""everything can be okay"". GD is what GD is, nobody can't change that. Banning GD will make things worse, they will reform under another name and another statute, and the groups associated with them will dive further underground. Making GD the scapegoat for the systemic inefficiencies of the Greek political system is convenient.

&gt; I'm not sure if doctors are allowed to do this in the way you mention.

Yes, they do. They collect data locally, then nationally, and finally internationally. This allows WHO to function and prepare for epidemics. But this is not only about doctors, but about all state institutions, everywhere.

&gt; Even if it is allowed, it probably has to do with how the data is anonymised. 

Here it is, you just joined the dark side, milk and cookies on your left. :)

That's exactly what happens. Knowing that X% of children in primary school are of Y origin, is legal. PASOK's government also provided such data for the City of Athens, and there were no legal objections. This was not challenged by the Ombudsman, or in courts.

Take a look at another example. Is this illegal and racist? No, it allows for proper planning.

Last week another Greek referenced the myth about officers' voting habits, and I explained to him in great detail why he is *mathematically* wrong. Vima's article remains as shitty as it was, earning a position in the Pantheon of Shoddy Journalism, right after Karamanlis' meeting with Erdogan (which didn't happen, although Vima managed to print what they discussed).

As for an increase in racist violence, there are no official data to support it. You just see more incidents being reported, because last year NGOs created a network recording them. Still, there are many problems with their procedure. [If an Iraqi, for example, is murdered, they label this incident ""racist"", although we don't know the perpetrators](http://www.unhcr.gr/nea/artikel/597cc04cf367c784687a3792d5b263d6/diktyo-katagrafis-p.html). In many cases, these incidents are the products of interethnic violence. Albanians attack Pakistanis, Bulgarians attack Albanians, Afghans attack Pakistanis, and so on. Greece can't take more immigrants, immigrants are desperate, immigrant groups fight for the control of drug trade, these things happen. ""Racist"" is not an umbrella term. I might agree about a small increase in bravado from imbeciles mimicking GD's action squads, *against Greeks and immigrants*, although we still don't have *official data* to support it.",0,1350408382,null,0,1350409113,0,c6ncfwo,t3_11gsg1,t1_c6ncfwo,t1_c6natyw,null,1430163208,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

I got some MicroSoft services and windows live doesn't force me to get an email address with them that must be shared over some services. It hasn't pressed me into linking my accounts, whereas Google forced me to link my YouTube account with my gmail account, which I both made before Google bought YouTube. I seriously had to take a sit back and think what the heck I all watched on youtube and thought it would be best if I just created another account for that.


That's because microsoft did it without asking you for any kind of permission.

By the way, you're not forced to share youtube with your google account.

And the main reason google wants to put it all under one roof is Android. 

&gt;If I sign up for a Live account now, I can probably still use any email address I like and make it a throw-away. Google's sessions make that a pain in the ass, as I would be constantly switching and it would be obvious two accounts are actually the same person.

Except that you can just add a new gmail to your existing account.

Hohlbein is pretty bad, but I've read almost all his books when I was a teenager. One series that's actually kinda good is his ""Enwor Saga"".

1) Internships.

They reply with a confused look followed by shrugging their shoulders.

2) Extracurricular activities at University. Ok, I guess this shows community interest and willing to go the proverbial extra mile. Though, how is this relevant work experience? It shows that I'm capable of administration and organizational skills beyond the capability of a retarded baboon.

I've spent most of my young adult life bouncing from city to city, and I've spent several years in each of LA, NYC, and Paris. I agree with most of what's been said in this thread. Personally, I would say if you're set on moving to Paris and lack of language is the only thing holding you back (assuming you can find work, which unfortunately is a big assumption these days), then you should absolutely go for it. The hardest part is getting set up - dealing with French landlords, opening a bank account, applying for your residency permit and dealing with Frency bureacracy, etc. But all of that doesn't last long, and it's extremely easy to get by once all that is done. 

I moved to Paris knowing basically no French and I felt quite comfortable getting around in the city within a couple months. You'll probably pick up ""survival French"" very quickly - i.e. the pleasantaries, knowing how to order food, how to ask for things without pissing people off, stuff like that. Beyond that, I didn't pick up much myself, but it really wasn't necessary. I enjoyed Paris all the same and have very fond memories of my time there. Would it have helped to be actively learning the language? Absolutely, but you can do that once you're there; it's not a hurdle to moving there in the first place. 

As another poster has mentioned, Paris is probably closer in feel to NYC than LA. They're both dense cities, you take the metro everywhere, there are crowds of people walking in the street, people have a general reputation of being a bit unfriendly, etc. I love such environments, so I loved Paris, even in the colder winter months (and it was never as cold as NYC). But that being said, I knew a fair number of Americans who moved to Paris who hated it. They were frustrated with the language barrier, with unfriendly people, with the bureacracy, and on and on. The one thing I would say helped me was the fact that I treated Paris like an adventure. The transition is much easier if you're easy-going and can laugh at things/yourself, because Paris is a place that can very easily frustrate you if you let it.

I just finished an internship with a small company. They are finding it difficult to get experienced workers. *However*, they have been recruiting graduates and interns - that's the difference. 

First of all, interns are cheap. In some cases, they can be two thirds to a half of the salary of even a graduate (well, if you are lousy enough with pay), but if you invest enough time and money in training them you can get at least graduate-quality work produced in some cases out of them. 

Interns and graduates are cheap. They will demand more pay later, but initially they offer great value and are truly valuable to your business. 

The company has a constant stream of talent coming from the local universities - and that is why they are succeeding. 

You should partner with good universities in your area and see what they can offer you in terms of interns and graduates. You might be surprised. 

So long as you put in place a proper training program, fresh talent like this could prove invaluable to your business. 

If you have trouble with staff turnover, you may want to offer more benefits to your staff too. It also helps to offer social opportunities to your staff.

There is no ultimately here. Under any form of EU membership, voters of Italy are unable to remove from office all of the people who are in charge of at least many aspects of many laws of high significance to their lives - say, most market-related laws. If its a directive, the local parliament they can vote out has some wiggle room, if its a regulation, none.

In other words, fairly loose form of federalism - but nonetheless, federalism.

Now its the same with budget - local parliament has actually pretty wide discretion on how to create its budget, but its final envelope, which is what matters for the economic stability of a currency, needs to be approved by the rest of the continent too. So what concerns all of us is decided by everyone, rather than just by Italians, while whatever doesn't really concern the rest of us, is left to the Italians. Subsidiarity in action I would say, given a context of belonging to a monetary union.

&gt; What do you think is going to happen if everything is passed up the chain to the European level? 

european-average quality laws, with european-average quality of democracy. I wouldn't mind average at all actually, but still I wouldn't accept concentrating all the power in Bruxelles. Rather, a diffusion of power, so neither local sovereigns nor the federal instance have too much of it. 

In other words, federalism.

Portugal and the others will have to leave the Euro and default or change the denomination on Euro denominated debt, Germany and it's satellites can do whatever they want with the ""Euro"" if they still want to call it that.  
  
Spain if it's smart will leave the Euro before crushing austerity completely destroys their economy like it happened in Greece and is happening in Portugal.  
  
Have no doubt, what we are currently doing is only widening the rift between southerners and the others, it is not fixing anything, quite the contrary.  
  
Portugal for instance has already committed to an impossible budget next year, approved by the commission of course. It will show to be impossible quite early and we will need a second bailout, more impossible austerity measures and crazy targets will be demanded to give it to us (when what was needed is a much longer timeframe to adjust) and the spiral of destruction will continue.  
    
It's going to suck anyway but anything is better than being stuck doing what we are doing now.  
  
The funny thing is, that both solutions Soros proposes would be better for everyone, as Germans and the others will have to (in some way, they could nationalize them too) bailout their banks when this happens and they wouldn't have to do so in either of Soros solutions and his solutions would mostly keep the EU project on the good track which I find good.",0,1350419738,null,0,false,0,c6nfvli,t3_11kq4f,t1_c6nfvli,t3_11kq4f,null,1430164829,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

If you haven't got a passport, I assume you have not been to Germany before. Which raises the question why you are ""really interested in moving"" to a place you don't know and have never been to.

The first step I can recommend is to travel to Germany as a tourist for no less than, say, 10 days and to check the place out. A return ticket to Germany from the West coast is about $800 (East coast: $600). You will need a passport, Department of State has information on that here: http://travel.state.gov/passport/get/first/first_830.html

I'm not implying being inside the Eurozone/economic decisions in other countries are not affecting our economy. Of course they are. Of course European leaders might be making wrong decisions as well. Denying there's no impact from the Eurozone to Spain's economy would be plain stupid on my part.

What the article (and I) are doing is focusing on the main reasons for the spanish financial problems, and rebutting another comment that plainly ignores THIS half of the problem (by stating our policies are being directed from Europe). Our problem so far is the only one we can do something about. Getting out of the Eurozone now would be disastrous for the spanish economy. It would be different if we had never joined it, but now it is too late. We need to do some house cleaning before we even think of how to solve the global economic issues.

The thing is the terms for our economic policies are not being dictated from Europe (yet). Our politicians have avoided accepting a rescue so far because it would mean accepting economic reforms (not cuts, which are already being applied by self-initiative) from Europe. 

This is what I was talking about. For months we've heard ""we're not going to request a rescue"", ""we don't need a rescue"", ""the cost of the rescue is too high"". Ask yourself, too high for who? We are already paying more and more taxes each year and it's not solving the problem. We still have a 25% unemployment rate and it's just gonna get higher. We got cuts in our social services and education and it's not solving the problem.

Fact is our economy is just not reliable for outsiders, people don't want to invest here, and the reason for this is simply that potential investors don't trust the people running the economy.

There seems to be a weird pattern in spanish mentality -companies, politicians- in which 'being more competitive' is equated with 'being cheaper'. As far as I know, this is not so in other countries of the Eurozone.

true,VomisaCaasi,ESTO,Estonia,"Compared to Latvia/Lithuania yes, compared to Finland/Sweden, well, not necessarily.

I guess Estonia's focus towards education in IT can be categorised into two stages. The first, which started around 95, had a goal of bringing computers and internet to every student. I think they/we achieved that somewhere around 99/00 when almost all of the schools had a broadband (read: ISDN) access and enough computers to actually teach computers to pupils. However, there were no real schoolbooks concerning the matter and the matter whether any of students actually gained from those classes anything other than using the web for social purposes/gaming is highly debatable. Back then, I think, there was no real programs for teachers either, so every teacher was supposed to learn IT on her own. That usually meant that if a pupil had a computer at home, there was a high probability that said kid was smarter than his computer teacher. Even nowadays they are still just teaching Excel/Word for 10th graders and nothing more. 

Though, I think that's about to change. There are few elite schools that have taken the initiative in ditching the schoolbooks altogether for tablets and I've heard the government wants to continue with that trend for all schools. Additionally, there are two separate programs with goals such as bringing programming and as well as robot building to elementary schools. Could that possibly mean that we would have an army of students highly skilled in the IT in high schools in 10 or 15 years? Probably not. There just isn't enough knowledgeable teachers around.

In higher education level, however, we have currently have 2-3 universities whose comp-sci programs can be almost be compared to those top ones the Americans have.

edit: Concerning the second question, yes, it definitely has. Though most of the Estonia's IT success could be considered a hype.

Your repeat shows even more arrogance. Your statement was patronising exactly because it was as if you had said ""Oh, it's not your fault; you can't help getting affected by all those news networks... unlike me"". On top of that, the very idea that the media favour Syriza in any way is so alien to me that I can't even begin to understand how you read the papers or watch TV and get that impression. 

&gt; It's more like ""keep calm and carry on"", because ""everything can be okay"". GD is what GD is, nobody can't change that.

We have to fix things okay by ourselves, not just stand back and watch. We must do something about GD and prevent them from killing people or staging a coup d' etat. You can't just say ""it is what it is"" and look away...

&gt;  Banning GD will make things worse [...]

I did not suggest that, you are fighting a strawman here.

&gt; That's exactly what happens. Knowing that X% of children in primary school are of Y origin, is legal.

I never said this is illegal. All I said was that the process the data is gathered is suspicious and possibly illegal because it does not guarantee proper anonymisation. 

&gt; Take a look at another example. Is this illegal and racist? No, it allows for proper planning.

We don't know how that data was gathered. You can't just claim it was gathered the same way that the Greek government is currently trying to gather the kindergarten data.

&gt; It's one thing to disagree with something, and another to claim that it is wrong. Last week another Greek referenced the myth about officers' voting habits, and I explained to him in great detail why he is mathematically wrong.

Your grasp of logic is not as good as you might think. You proved one article was wrong. That proves nothing about the voting habits of policemen. You should know that much. The police union representative has publicly admitted that a huge number of policemen vote and support Golden Dawn. But in your mind, finding a single shitty article and figuring out that they did it wrong ""mathematically"" proves there is no such thing as policemen-GD correlation. This is not how logic works and please don't pretend that it is.

The same can be said about your arguments regarding racist violence against immigrants. Even though the increase has been obvious to anyone paying the slightest of attention, you still choose to forget about the daily attacks conducted by GD and other ""frustrated citizen groups"". The attacks are captured on video, there are eye witnesses, people end up in hospitals or worse. GD has been recruiting and expanding its activities since the onset of the crisis. Even the Minister of Justice has admitted the problem. But you are still waiting for ""official data"".
