This might, maybe, result in slightly cheaper cars. But the big chunk of profits will go, as always, directly to shareholders.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; No we would have to compete directly with American workers on wages. Right now for example car companies like Ford and GM have factories in Europe and in America. Without any trade barriers they could instead produce everything in America where wages are lower. And as long as wages in Europe don't fall to the same level they have no reason to come back.

Most factory work is robotized and in coming decades automation will only increase. Already Toyota has a new highly robotized plant in Japan that can compete in production costs with plants in China. Competent engineers, designers and business people on the other hand cost the same in US if not actually even more than in Europe. So I don't really see that US could out compete European manufacturers.

Not to mention that European manufacturers should increasingly specialize and concentrate on producing high value products and service. In bulk and low value products and services the Chinese will beat European manufacturers sooner or later.

&gt; This might, maybe, result in slightly cheaper cars. But the big chunk of profits will go, as always, directly to shareholders.

Which also include pension funds and people who have saved and invested to stocks.

&gt; Even inside Europe free trade seems to be a problem. Spanish workers can not compete with German wages and as a result we have mass unemployment in Spain, whereas export companies in Germany make huge profits. If those profits would be used to increase German wages, higher domestic demand in Germany would allow more imports from Spain and everything would be fine again, however, wages in Germany are stagnating. All the profits seem to go somewhere else.

If German wages would go up, it wouldn't lead to Spanish industries having more orders and customers from Germany, but money flowing to mainly to US and China. This is because most consumers goods are usually manufactured in China and most services and content in the US. If my wage would jump up another 10% it wouldn't lead me to buy more apples and tomatoes from Spain, but to buy more clothes (China&amp;India), more electronics (China) and more services (US).",0,1353406581,null,0,false,0,c745keh,t3_13gx50,t1_c745keh,t1_c74583a,null,1430454549,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Everybody is equally the „EU's bitch”. 

If only this were true. But it isn't. France is not the EUs bitch. France can throw its toys out of the pram whenever the CAP or Strasbourg is mentioned, and no one bats an eyelid. Germany is not the EUs bitch. Greece *is* the EUs bitch. As is Spain. And the UK, though for different reasons. All is not equal in Europe, but I'm sure the view looks good from the top. 

A poster above noted that the UK did not have parity in its relationship with the US, but failed to make the next step in realising that this is also true of the EU. 

&gt; You feel that the rest of the EU is planning a budget without you? Well get back in the game and throw your weight around, like every other fucking member state

There is no 'weight' for us *to* throw around. The EU and the UK started going their separate ways when the UK refused to adopt the Euro. The subsequent track of the EU after that point has all been about 'fixing' the Euro, and nations not in the Euro are considered irrelevant to the decision making process. 

In hindsight, this was always going to happen. We're just along for the ride, now, until we get sick of it and finally decide to get off. 

&gt; You want other states to be outraged on the French CAP position. Go form aliances with other member states, like all the other states do. Negotiate. 

Impossible. No one is going to side with the UK against what France or Germany want. We've been trying to reform the CAP for THIRTY YEARS, for example - what makes you suddenly think that nations are going to side with the UK now? Especially given that we're not on your currency roller-coaster ride. 

When I came to this subreddit I was pro-EU. But now, I can see our involvement in the project is coming to an end. The nations currently embroiled in the Euro crisis do not share our non-Federal vision of the future EU.  I guess this is fair enough - Federalism is a possible solution to the crisis. But in order for us to truly be a part of the future EU the UK would have to embrace both a currency it sees as a failure, and a political model that few in the UK even want.

You know why that discrepancy exists? Because the UK is small compared to the US, but it's one of the top 3 economies in the EU. Therefore most people don't expect the UK to be on equal footing with the US, but people do expect it to be a heavywheight in the EU, and think that if it's not, it is mostly its own fault.

Au passage ni Aubry ni Royal n'en avait profité.

e lo stiamo facendo, volenti o nolenti. Le cause sono complesse, alcune dipendenti dall'Italia, altre da fattori esterni.

&gt; Stiamo parlando di un paese con un governo spuntato fuori senza un'elezione

La ragione è dovuta al fatto che il governo spuntato fuori da un'elezione per 20 anni è stato incapace di effettuare scelte di direzione importanti a garantire la viabilità economica della Nazione. Se questo dipende dalla loro inettitudine o dal fatto che il resto del mondo ci ha ""fregato"" mettendoci in una posizione di stallo, non so dirlo, ma a giudicare da quello che sappiamo della nostra classe politica, sono molto, molto, molto più propenso a pensare alla prima ipotesi. Certo ci possono essere anche fattori della seconda ipotesi, ma in alcuni casi dipendono da mancanza di forza politica e pressapochismo, quindi si ricade nuovamente nel primo caso.

Non mi piace Napolitano come presidente, è un debole, ma è l'arbitro del gioco. Ha fatto una scelta, forse non decisa dagli italiani, ma ha scelto per l'italia. Azzardato? forse, ma l'alternativa, andare al voto, avrebbe richiesto un tempo così lungo, e prodotto un teatrino politico così plateale, che ci avrebbe affossato (_affossato_) in un batter d'occhio. I mercati hanno deciso che il governo Berlusconi mentiva, e le prospettive e politiche attuate non avrebbero portato a un ritorno dell'investimento previsto. Puoi aver votato per un governo, ma questo governo è andato al potere vendendo ai cittadini e alle nazioni estere delle menzogne, o non avendo messo in pratica niente di ciò che era necessario a soddisfare il mercato.

&gt; e con interessi e obiettivi che non sono certo pensati per gli italiani.

Sono forse pensati per l'europa, e in un certo senso, per l'Italia e gli italiani. Che ti piaccia o no, siamo parte dell'europa, e la ragione per cui siamo parte dell'europa è perchè attraverso una politica simile, abbiamo evitato un crash economico completo. L'europa unita è un progetto in cantiere sin dalla fine della seconda guerra mondiale (se includi l'opzione militare, sin dall'asse roma-berlino). Il problema è che l'europa è troppo diversa, troppo frammentata e troppo sbilanciata, e uniformarla economicamente e nel mercato globale è sulla carta (e anche in pratica) una buona idea. Realizzare questo piano in modo ottimale e competitivo è tutto un altro discorso, e qualcuno deve rimetterci. Il problema è, ancora una volta, che a causa di questioni politiche certe nazioni o l'hanno preso nel di dietro, o non hanno fatto ciò che andava fatto, in termini di sviluppo economico, semplificazione burocratica, uniformità legislativa, sviluppo dell'infrastruttura, organizzazione dell'impresa.

&gt; Non so quanto abbiate letto di Trilaterale e Bilderberg, ma ci tengo a dire che questi temi non sono portati avanti da teorici del complotto, ma piuttosto alla luce del sole e preoccupanti per molti premi nobel, tra cui alcuni economisti che si discostano dalla mandria di finanzieri di un certo tipo.

Ci sono dei Ph.D. in biologia che non credono nell'evoluzione, o dei geologi che pensano che la terra abbia 6000 anni e i dinosauri siano andati estinti nell'alluvione di Noè. 

Ok, esempio sarcastico, ma quello che voglio dire è questo. Ci saranno economisti che preventivano diversamente, ma fare previsioni economiche è simile a fare previsioni del tempo, con l'unica differenza che nelle previsioni del tempo ci son due o tre leggi, Navier-Stokes e balle varie, e sai i dati in ogni cella con buona accuratezza, mentre in economia ci si basa su modelli spessissimo assunti come lineari (e.g. la dipendenza del PIL dallo sviluppo tecnologico, cerca alla voce moltiplicatori economico e modello IS-LM) che potrebbero (o direi certamente sono) non essere lineari per niente, su dati che possono essere sbagliati, nascosti, o manipolati, di un sistema complesso di cui non sai le connessioni e dipendenze (perchè sono nascoste anch'esse) e nelle quali hai imprevisti (guerre, uragani, terremoti) o previsti (esaurimento dei pozzi petroliferi, domanda di certi componenti) o semi-previsti (sviluppo tecnologico) che possono essere sovrastimati o sottostimati.

E' un casino, e mentre uno può dire a questo punto che una opinione è uguale a un'altra, in pratica uno può giocare d'ottimismo o di pessimismo, anche se ci sono vincoli matematici che ti possono dare un'idea. Se sei già nella merda, è meglio stare dalla parte del pessimismo.

Ho ascoltato cosa dice Monti, e certi commenti sono non-sequitur. 
""Cessioni della sovranità popolare all'europa dei banchieri""... Fammi decomporre il problema

1. Cedere la sovranità popolare dipende da cosa intendi per entità sovrana. In un'ottica europea, hai la sovranità popolare a livello europeo. Siamo ai primordi dell'europa. Idealmente, l'europa dovrebbe diventare uno Stato ""omogeneo"" (e la mobilità dei trattati di Schengen lo rende più semplice) dove le decisioni comunitarie avvengono a livello comunitario, e le decisioni pertinenti a livello locale vengono gestite a livello locale, similmente al modello americano. Ora, non dico che il modello americano sia giusto. Dico che c'è la tendenza a quel tipo di modello. Il problema di base è che l'europa ha implementato una via di mezzo che fa solo un casino.
2. l'europa dei banchieri. L'europa non è perfetta, ma le banche sono un'entità fondamentale nel sistema economico in cui siamo. Le banche _creano_ soldi (il sistema si chiama riserva frazionaria) così come la banca centrale. è un sistema strano, ma ""funziona"", e in particolare funziona perchè consente la creazione di lavoro e innovazione attraverso i prestiti (per ristrutturare una casa, creare un'azienda o un prodotto). Funziona e non funziona, perchè ha anche i suoi difetti, e grossi, ma non posso farti una lezione di economia. Resta il fatto che, allo stato attuale, è il meglio che siamo riusciti a inventare come umanità per controllare un sistema di transazioni in modo che il sistema più o meno si autoadatti e autosostenga, una forma di [comportamento emergente](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comportamento_emergente) che è altamente desiderabile, semplicemente perchè per come scala (scalabilità) un sistema complesso, non riesci a controllarlo, deve autoregolarsi. Questo per dire che i banchieri sono una parte importante del sistema, e per quanto possano essere dei pezzenti in molte circostanze, sono una parte del gioco. Compito del governo (europeo) è definire regole uniformi e produttive per il lungo termine. Qui entra in ballo il terzo punto
3. l'europa non rappresenta i cittadini europei. Vero, forse. Ancora una volta, il problema deriva dal fatto che tutti vogliono essere padroni a casa propria, e nessuno vuol farne a meno. Purtroppo, ""casa propria"" ha un affitto troppo alto per ciascuno degli abitanti, e l'unica soluzione è mettersi assieme e vivere in una grande casa assieme. Ci si litigherà per andare in bagno, ma almeno non siamo in mezzo a una strada (per adesso). C'è una tendenza da parte del cittadino non solo a pensare all'Italia (Spagna, Grecia...) più che all'europa, ma non è neanche incentivato il ""pensare europa"", ne' è incentivata la comprensione dell'importanza dell'europa. La persona europea più potente in termini decisionali è la Merkel, non il presidente del consiglio europeo (chiunque sia in questi sei mesi). 

non voglio annoiarti, ma alla fine capisco il problema della tua obiezione, ma soluzioni semplici sono populiste, perchè il problema è un dannato casino. 


&gt; Sul discorso schiavi e schiavisti ci siamo capiti male: io dico che abbiamo sbagliato giocando al capitalismo sulle spalle di paesi in cui c'era lo schiavismo e adesso ne raccogliamo i frutti: adesso i cinesi schiavisti, i russi schiavisti, etc, sono in italia e stanno comprando tutto, presto noi lavoreremo per loro con le loro regole e questo anche per le nostre omissioni.

Questo perchè abbiamo deciso per una economia globale. La globalizzazione ci ha portato alla migrazione di posti di lavoro, ma ci ha anche dato risorse e prodotti a basso prezzo, e aperto (potenzialmente) a nuovi mercati. Secondo un testo di economia di cui non ricordo (forse il Gartner) l'idea della globalizzazione economica è basata sull'assunto che attuando scambi tra due partner, si ottenga un miglioramento _complessivo_ di entrambi i partner nella media, potenzialmente a scapito di certi interessi locali che perderanno di potere. Il che vuol dire che qualcuno se lo prenderà in quel posto, ma in media, se ne avrà un beneficio, fosse anche l'incremento di scelta da parte del consumatore. Ieri compravi solo vino italiano, oggi puoi scegliere tra vino italiano, portoghese, francese, tedesco (e così anche gli altri). In più, aprire a un mercato uniforme (WTO) consente a certi paesi di vendere i propri prodotti all'estero con tasse d'importazione egalitarie nel sistema, a patto che soddisfino certi criteri e che aprano il proprio import come gli altri aprono il loro. Ti consiglio il libro di Re Abdullah II di Giordania per un'analisi importante della questione. Inoltre, lasciare le risorse economiche verso altri paesi può fornire 1) meno tensione militare, non è comodo avere un mare di gente che fa la fame ai tuoi confini, sia perchè non possono comprare i tuoi prodotti, sia perchè se si incazzano poi sono cazzi. La seconda guerra mondiale ci ha insegnato che affamare i tedeschi alla fine della prima non è stata una buona strategia, da cui i piani Marshall. 2) possono dare buone idee. L'innovazione è ispirazione. Domani un cinese ti inventa un algoritmo che ti trasforma la robotica o quel che è, creando un nuovo settore. Se la Cina non aveva i soldi, quel cinese coltivava riso, invece che cambiare il mondo.

Certo, tu dici i russi e i cinesi comprano tutto. Vero. Ma in cambio ti danno il gas a prezzo più basso e prodotti che non riusciresti a fare in Italia perchè troppo costosi o per mancanza di infrastruttura o tecnologia. In cambio i cinesi e i russi comprano il nostro vino, le nostre auto, e vengono in vacanza qui. Quanto ci vengano dipende dalla nostra abilità politica di convincerli a preferirci rispetto agli altri, e questo dipende dalla gente che ci comanda, dalla camera di commercio al ministro degli esteri, dalle ambasciate e sedi consolari alle università di scambio linguistico e commerciale.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; There is a difference between „no weight” and „not as big a weight as it should”. Yes, maybe the Euro has taken up a big part of the discussion, but that's understandable given how close to the brink it is.

I think you're underestimating the impact of the Euro crisis on EU politics. Federalisation was always on the table, but it's never been an inevitability until now. Federalisation has been pushed forward rapidly, as it has been sold as the sole solution to the crisis (a true cynic would site [The Power Of Nightmares](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGo1DqmfHjY) at this point). As such, anyone not on board with the Euro (and thus Federalisation) has no say in the process. They are *in the way*. You only have to read the comments in this subreddit to see that this is the overwhelming sentiment. 

&gt; Also you should keep in mind that the UK is not the only EU country outside the eurozone, yet it is the only one that feels marginalized.

Well, most of those states are eventually [obliged to join the Euro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone#Member_states). Only two nations that I know of have the opt-out, the UK and Denmark. Has anyone asked the Danes if they feel marginalised? 

&gt; You're also getting the impression that the UK has no weight, which is simply not true. It might be irrelevant in the Eurozone-discussions, but there are other non-Euro countries it could approach when discussing pan-EU issues (which are not the same as the Eurozone issues).

The main topics on the table have been, for years now, the Euro and the creation of a Federation. We have no say in either of those. The peripheral subjects up for discussion, such as the CAP and the use of Strasbourg, are issues that we've been attacking for up to 30 years without any success, so obviously we have no say in *those* either. 

So why exactly are we even in the EU, other than because of the fear of not being in it? 

&gt; Look, It just seems that the UK loves to play the victim (I really don't know why it has such a weird relationship with the EU). It looks like the emo kid that isolates himself then laments that he's an outcast.

I don't get it. 

I've explained the legitimate gripes the UK has with the EU, and our inability to resolve them, in the past, now or at any time in the future, and you just come back with this analogy which suggests none of the complaints are legitimate. 

As a side note - the reason we have a weird relationship with the EU is that we were kept out for ages by De Gaulle (and wasn't that a knife in the back, if ever there was one?), and by the time we finally joined, the EU had become what it is today - a Franco-German club, with every other state in orbit around their decision making. 

If you don't believe me, then think of this - can you think of a single piece of EU legislation that was passed despite objections from France or Germany? Can you think of a single direction that the EU has taken which was not wholly supported by both France and Germany?

However recently alot of French people in rural areas are taking to the ideas of the Front National. This is a recent development.

The most right areas in France are the SouthEast and here UMP is very strong and FN aswell.In general, French people of all sections from left to right are generally for the continuation of the social state. The centre and centre right are the most pro-market but not on the level of Englsih speaking countries.

So basically people in rural France are not all conservative. In SouthEast France however (incidently where I lived) it is a very right wing area in the city and in rural areas. They would not mainly campaign for less state, but instead for stronger laws on social issues (less immigration, harsh crimes to criminals, no homosexual marriages, less benefit to workers).

I know the SouthWest has historically been a left wing region. Alot of the WW2 resistance came from there, in the 70's there was the Larzac movement there http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_for_the_Larzac so they are a special case. I think in most other rural areas its pretty moderately conservative.

I wouldnt say that urban areas are right wing. The big cities Paris and Lyon have had Left wing mayors for a long time. The North of France near Belgium wich was historically a very working class area is also leftwing. Marseille in the SouthEast has a right wing one, but thats because the Southeast is very right wing. A large reason for this is that this is where most immigrants to France came in as Marseille is the entry port from North Africa and Orient into France. So in SouthEastern France you have alot more immigrants which is probably why the area is so right wing. So ya, most urban areas are not necessarliy right wing. Infact I would say they are most likely leftwing except for those in the SouthEast.

As for Alsace, I think they are rightwing as they are fiscal conservatives and social conservatives, and on average more religious than the rest of France. The French laws of Laicite dont apply to Alsace as the are was integrated in France after the law passed, so Alsace keeps quite a few of its ""German"" traditions. To be honest you dont really hear much of Alsatians, but the steortypical image of them is for them to be right wing. You wouldnt expect Alsacians protesting.

You do realise that the militant wing of Fatah is also recognised as a terrorist organisation in the EU too, don't you?

The rhetoric that ignores al-Aqsa as Fatah but makes al-Qassam synonymous with Hamas is engineered.  You're being played.

There's good reason why the UK opted out of designating Hamas a terrorist organisation but were happy to put the al-Qassam Brigades (their military wing) on the list.  Why Australia followed suit and why France and Germany wanted to but were outvoted. Incidentally it's another reason why there should never be a joint European foreign policy.  The EU policy is actually now enabling Israel to justify civilian deaths.  Rather than identify the militant wing as separate they are in effect supporting Israel attacking the administration in Gaza which also runs hospitals, roads, schools and energy. It's a shame the UK only had a vote and an opt out, and not a veto, because Europe's fucked it up again.  The UK has experience in this with dealing with Sinn Fein; they should have listened.



For the record, however bad they are (and they are), when Hamas declares a ceasefire its militant wing sticks to it.  Al-Aqsa of Fatah don't, not only that they actively tried to break the Hamas ceasefire by firing on Israel from Gaza, they still conduct operations when their political wing is saying other things, and Hamas ordered the end of suicide bombings before Fatah or their  al-Aqsa.

The whole narrative has been corrupted, and the angle of Fatah suitable to enter peacetalks but not Hamas is only there to serve one purpose: to hobble peace talks before they begin e.g. Annapolis.",0,1353434597,null,0,1353494200,0,c74aohr,t3_13ikzo,t1_c74aohr,t1_c74aauy,null,1430456929,26,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,26

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; In Germany pensions are (still) paid directly (via tax) and don't go the useless detour through financial market speculation which only makes the whole pension system unstable anyway.

The problem with that is that the ability of the society to afford pay pensions is directly connected on its ability to collect taxes. With pension funds, part of my pay goes to the fund that then invests it to different investments instruments and markets. It enables companies and countries to access capital that allows them to grow faster, and earning comfortable interest to the fund, allowing savers to invest less to the fund. It should also be noted that thanks to diversification of funds, funds ability to pay pensions wouldn't be shaken if the Finnish state would drift to economic trouble.

&gt; No if wages would go up the money would stay in Europe and would eventually reach Spain through higher demand. Right now the excess profit money is flowing out of Europe (or into Switzerland). Higher wages would prevent that.

Most highly developed economies keep around 80% of the GDP that they produce. Less developed and less wealthy economies keep much less. The money already stays here, but again, there is no coercive reason why they would go to Spain. Money goes to Spain if Spain produces something that the markets want.

&gt; Like Finland has more to offer than Nokia Phones, Spain has certainly much more to offer than apples and tomatoes. Also: you could just buy higher quality apples from Spain instead of importing low quality from Kasachtan. 

Spanish apples are the low quality option, enlightened customers buy Finnish apples that have lower amounts of pesticides than ones produces in central, south or east Europe. Another thing is that one can only buy so much better commodities, somewhere along the line you can't any more taste the difference. The thing is that consumers put most of their money to high value items or to services.

- C'est bien parce que les prédictions de la mécanique quantique donnent de très bons résultats qu'on continue à s'en servir. Le fait que la mesure modifie l''objet' mesuré n'a rien à voir là-dedans. Après, je ne suis pas physicien donc je n'irai pas plus loin. Je suis très ignorant de la physique quantique. (un jour!)  
- Le choix des gamètes, un phénomène non déterministe ? Pas entièrement déterministe, je suis d'accord (il y a une part de hasard, encore une fois aucun rapport avec les questions morales, m'enfin), mais il y a quand même un degré énorme de déterminisme, ne serait-ce qu'à travers la sélection naturelle.  
- J'ai dit ignorants (pas un crime, pas irrémédiable) ou débiles (pas un crime, parfois irrémédiable), ce qui n'est pas la même chose que méchant, point.  
- Hé bien tu vois, pour Kant, je me coucherais moins bête ce soir, je te sortais des souvenirs brumeux de terminale, au temps pour moi. Note tout de même que ce que défend Kant est une vision déiste et spiritualiste qui peut s'accorder du catholicisme mais ne lui est pas particulière.  
- Plutôt que d'utiliser Nietzche, je propose d'utiliser *Max et Lili ont volé des bonbons* comme base de réflexion. Sur le thème du vol, c'est un essai moral plus solide et mieux argumenté que la bible, qui présente 1/ des enseignements contradictoires, exemple avec le ""tu ne voleras point"" immédiatement suivi par un ordre direct de Moïse en faveur d'un massacre puis d'un pillage, 2/ une absence totale de réflexion sur le bien-fondé des règles que l'on observe, 3/ un grand manque de clarté, ce qui, je persiste et signe, n'est pas une bonne chose dans un travail philosophique sur le thème de la morale (ou autre). Le bouquin de Max&amp;Lili est au premier degré, clair, argumenté, édifiant et ludique. Et il ne souffre pas de tous les problèmes de traduction que l'on connaît.  
- C'est encore un cliché éculé, que la science s'intéresse au comment alors que la religion s'intéresse au pourquoi. Quand tu postules l'existence de créatures surnaturelles, c'est du comment. Quand tu avances l'hypothèse d'une après-vie et d'un arrière-monde immatériel, c'est du comment. Quand tu décris des mécanismes magiques tels que la prière, c'est du comment. C'est évaluable et discutable selon des moyens scientifiques. Le pourquoi n'est qu'un aspect très exigu et très limité des croyances religieuses. (et il n'y a pas besoin d'être croyant pour poser la question du pourquoi non plus) 
- Croire en dieu =/= être religieux, pour commencer. Le déisme est une position plus ou moins inoffensive contre laquelle je n'argumente jamais, parce que je pense qu'il est possible de la défendre solidement et que je n'ai pas vraiment de conflit avec. Les religions et tout ce qu'elles supposent, c'est autre chose.

Die Juristen unter uns können das sicher genauer erklären, aber ""Aussage gegen Aussage"" bedeutet nicht unbedingt Freispruch. Richter haben die Möglichkeit, die eine oder andere Aussage als glaubwürdiger zu betrachten, und nutzen es auch. 

In diesem Fall ist es z.B. ziemlich sicher, dass die Neonazis vor der Tür waren (die Polizisten haben es gesehen). Wenn die Bedrohten jetzt aussagen, sie wären bedroht worden, und die Neonazis behaupten, das wäre nicht der Fall gewesen, wie wird dann der Richter entscheiden? Wird er den Neonazis glauben, dass sie nur zum Spaß vor der Tür gestanden sind?

That a minimum wage is set, I also agree with that, what I don't agree with is the system under which it was implemented in my country or in Spain or Greece where the government decides an arbitrary value for everyone. A system like the one in Austria, Germany, Denmark or Sweden seems much more reasonable because it allows for people with lower skills or lower age to have a minimum wage lower than people with better skills and that have been employed for longer, it's decided not by bureaucrats for everyone but by the labour union, the employer and the employee itself, it's much more flexible, it still allows for a minimum level of welfare and it doesn't create inefficiencies or promote unemployment like the system which we have now.

Yes the SPD is talking about a minimum wage but keep in mind that we have a election next year.
Looking at the pools right now, there is a high possibility that we will get a grand coalition.  The last time we got one the SPD hasn't pushed for a minimum wage when it was part of a coalition with the CDU.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"If Israel ever annexed the West Bank and Gaza, it would be accompanied with the large-scale ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians. The Israelis could easily justify this by pointing out that many European countries are far more ethnically homogeneous than Israel, and most of those are because of large-scale ethnic cleansing campaigns. Poland and the Czech Republic aren't international pariahs, despite having summarily ejected millions of Germans, with hundreds of thousands of casualties in the process. Croatia is not an international pariah, despite having ejected hundreds of thousands of Serbs.

People who think that Israel could just annex the Palestinian territories and everyone would get along just fine are naive imbeciles who clearly have never spent more than twenty seconds thinking about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. If the annexation happened, then it would simply reignite the Palestinian civil war that preceded Britain's withdrawal from the Mandate. And this time, the Jews would win *overwhelmingly*, and they would do so with the lesson that no matter how they treated any occupied population, they would be endlessly and disproportionately criticized in international circles. The lesson from the EU is not to occupy people, but the lesson learned by Israel (and frankly, by everyone else) is that it is better to simply ethnically cleanse any occupied territory of any opposing side, so that way you're just holding on to land, not ""oppressing people."" So if Israel did feel that it had to annex the Palestinian territories, then it would probably also feel the need to ethnically cleanse them, because that is the lesson that Europe has taught. Israel is the target of endless European opprobrium for occupying Palestinians, but Croatia is becoming a full-fledged member of the EU and nobody really brings up that whole ""Operation Storm"" thing. The EU punishes Israel for occupying another people and ignores Croatia's past history of ethnic cleansing. The rational conclusion to this is that it is more beneficial to do something absolutely terrible just once and for only a little while, than to try and avoid that horrible thing by managing a hostile population in a ""more humane"" manner.

The Danes don't habitually veto proposals. Sweden has their own little loophole as well.

&gt;The main topics on the table have been, for years now, the Euro and the creation of a Federation. We have no say in either of those.

Because you don't want to be part of them. When you invite your neighbours for a barbecue, the one that doesn't want to come has no say in the choice of the menu.

&gt;The peripheral subjects up for discussion, such as the CAP and the use of Strasbourg, are issues that we've been attacking for up to 30 years without any success, so obviously we have no say in those either.

Not getting your way does not mean you have no influence. The EU is not the British Empire.

&gt;So why exactly are we even in the EU, other than because of the fear of not being in it?

Because of the traditional British policy of trying to keep the mainland divided.

&gt;Can you think of a single direction that the EU has taken which was not wholly supported by both France and Germany?

There have been plenty of times when France and Germany disagreed, but they negotiate, cede some points and win others, and in the end they can both stand behind the result of that process.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Because it works on the premise that people will let it happen. The minimum wage law is there, because if there wasn't one, employers would pay less. Ever heard of a saying: ""I'd pay you less, if I could""?

It's obvious that employers would pay less if they could because it would minimize their costs but it's also truth that employees also would be paid more if they could because it would maximize their benefits. There's no monopoly on employers, there's supply and demand of labour and even these can change as more people enter or leave the workforce or create or end their business, to imply that employers can pay less than what the employees agree to is false.

Seriously, it's nonsense to imply that the minimum wage is there keeping wages high, everyone who's not paid minimum wage is proof of it. If that was the case, that employers would pay less if the minimum wage was in place, everyone would be paid minimum wage because it would be minimum amount required, but that's not the case as the minimum wage only affects those under the threshold. What the current minimum wage does is to simply make people who'd want and should work for an amount less than the required, to be unemployed, and I'm absolutely sure that being unemployed is a much worse condition to be in than being in a job that pays less than x, x being the minimum wage decided by the government.

&gt;Also, Austrian economics have been debunked a long time ago, but somehow you Libertarians picked it up again with Ron Paul craze.

Austrian economics? Are you trolling me? First you shit on Milton Friedman, then you said you used to agree with him, then you said it's impossible, then you dodge the question and bash the Austrian school (which is Hayek's and Von Mises' school, not Friedman's, but this much you know because you're already mentioned the Chicago school).. are you for real?

Regardless, Austrian economics hasn't been ""debunked"" like you mentioned. Not that I agree with the Austrian school, though, while they do present several wise policies which are more focused on efficiency rather than on popularity, I honestly disagree with their monetary policy and, on some aspects, on their role of government. Their fiscal policy might be very well defined but I'm a Keynesian (not a neo-Keynesian, though, those are just stupid and don't know a thing about what Keynes said and in the context in which he said it), I believe there's a role for the government and that, for example, one of it is to control monetary policy and not leave it to the private sector, something that an Austrian would disagree with.

It was only part-time, they managed. The cost of living is lower here so yeah, while one can't live on that, it helps, it's better than nothing at all, which would be what they'd get if they had follow the minimum wage law.

&gt;The state will have to subsidize. What's the point?

Subsidies tend to promote inefficiency but in this case, if it's required, I'd support them, it's much better to promote employment at the cost of greater public expense than to promote unemployment at the cost of reduced public revenue.

Though you need to look at these aspects more closely as these have impacts of their own, in case of the subsidy on the wage, one of them could be companies actually paying less than what they should because it would be indifferent for the worker because of the state subsidy and we can't allow the private sector to, in essence, pass the bill to the taxpayer.

It's certainly a complicated issue, what I do can tell you is that a minimum wage where there's an arbitrary value under which people aren't allowed to be employed is inefficient and doesn't serve the purpose of increasing the wages and the welfare of the people it wants to help.

If you were to ask me what I'd do, I'd do what Austria, Germany, Denmark and Sweden already are doing, it seems to be working fine for them. They have a minimum wage which is much more flexible and that isn't decided like ""x for everyone, no exceptions"" by a lawmaker, it's something that's agreed by the union, the employer and the worker - meaning that it does serve the purpose of the minimum wage, to prevent workers of being paid less than a certain amount, and it also avoids the inefficiencies and the negative effects that a system like the Portuguese one presents, which is increasing unemployment as opposed to increasing wages.",0,1353457690,null,0,false,0,c74h6ae,t3_13isx5,t1_c74h6ae,t1_c74ft62,null,1430460098,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

&gt;Today’s world is a global village; nations are closer than ever before. In such a world, respect for values and figures — religious or otherwise — that nations hold dear is a necessary requirement to build sustainable, mutually beneficial relationships.

&gt;In a new democratic Egypt, Egyptians earned the right to voice their anger over such issues, and they expect their government to uphold and protect their right to do so. However, they should do so peacefully and within the bounds of the law.

&gt;The breach of the United States Embassy premises by Egyptian protesters is illegal under international law. The failure of the protecting police force has to be investigated.

&gt;We are relieved that no embassy staff in Cairo were harmed. Egypt is going through a state of revolutionary fluidity, and public anger needs to be dealt with responsibly and with caution. Our condolences to the American people for the loss of their ambassador and three members of the embassy staff in Libya.

&gt;Cairo, Sept. 13, 2012

President Morsi apparently tries to appease his own people, but he's mindful of trying to respect foreigners as well - from [AP](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/egyptian-pres-vows-not-allow-attacks-embassies-says-egyptians-reject-unlawful-acts):

&gt;Egypt's Islamist President Mohammed Morsi condemned the attack on Libya that killed the American ambassador and vowed Thursday to protect foreign embassies in Cairo, where police were using tear gas to disperse protesters at the U.S. mission....

&gt;Speaking during a visit to the European Union in Brussels, Morsi said he had spoken to President Barack Obama and condemned ""in the clearest terms"" the Tuesday attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that killed the ambassador and three other Americans.

&gt;He also harshly criticized the movie, which came to attention in Egypt after its trailer was dubbed into Arabic and posted on YouTube.

&gt;""We condemn strongly ... all those who launch such provocations and who stand behind that hatred,"" Morsi said, adding that he had asked Obama ""to put an end to such behavior.""

&gt;""But at the same time we say this cannot be taken as a justification for attacking embassies or consulates,"" he said. ""The Egyptian state is responsible for protecting embassies and consulates, and the Egyptian people will not engage in these ... unlawful acts.""

From [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444023704577651222704454332.html?mod=googlenews_wsj):

&gt;Egypt's powerful Muslim Brotherhood, which had called for vigils outside major mosques on Friday afternoon, canceled them just hours beforehand. It called instead for a ""symbolic"" demonstration in downtown Cairo's Tahrir Square, essentially communicating to its grassroots structure that the group would not be organizing protests....

&gt;Before Thursday, the rage appeared to be tolerated, or even stoked, by Egypt's President Mohammed Morsi. On Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama suggested to a Spanish-language television station that he questioned Egypt's bona fides as an ally. The White House later played down that statement, and by Thursday, after a phone conversation between the presidents, Mr. Morsi vowed to protect foreign missions.
 
&gt;In a Friday morning address on state television, Mr. Morsi took the appeal to the public.

&gt;""It is required by our religion to protect our guests and their homes and places of work,"" he said during a seven-minute talk. ""So I call on all to consider this, consider the law and not attack embassies, consulates, diplomatic missions or Egyptian property that is private or public.""

That sort of sounds like what my friend did.  She got her CELTA (which is a certificate to teach others English as a foreign language) through Cambridge.  She is American, so I believe this was done at a satellite location here in the US.  If you google CELTA a lot of courses come up.  I did not go through this.  I have not heard of TESOL, but that could just be my naivete (sp?).  

From the little research I did when searching for this, it seems like different programs have different minimum requirements.  As with any job market, any extra couldn't hurt.  And as always you have to measure the costs against the benefits.  Perhaps your college study abroad office has more official information of English teaching opportunities abroad.  The study abroad office at my university had info. not just on study opportunities but also of careers and volunteering.  

Again hope it helps, and I will answer any questions this brings up if I can.  I understand the confusion.  My head was swimming when I was looking into it (how official is the program, am I qualified, how secure is the position, etc.).  That's why I decided to go through the Spanish embassy: it's official, I fulfilled the minimum req., it is a paid position with benefits, etc.  If Spain is not the country you want to go to, maybe check out the websites for the countries you want to go to. :D",0,1353466645,null,0,false,0,c74jbng,t3_139oqp,t1_c74jbng,t1_c74bd0b,null,1430461129,1,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,1
true,ajehals,null,null,"&gt;Well an element which calls itself the IRA but is really made up of small paramilitaries still exists

Not really.  The Provisional IRA essentially ceased to exist at some point between 1992 and 2004, largely because of the political process that was initiated.  There are Irish republican splinter groups now, but they don't have the same capacity that the IRA did...  Of course that doesn't stop some groups (RIRA, OIRA, CIRA, INLA etc..) trying to continue the armed struggle, but hey its a hell of a lot better than it was not so long ago.

The focus has changed to the political process with an aim at devolution and independence (or unity with ROI) in a similar way that Scotland is approaching it.  Note that the Unionist paramilitary groups have also essentially disappeared...

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"No real positive information on my background, that's a strict Internet no-no for me, I'm afraid, and why I've never Facebooked, Tweeted or blogged either.  I will say that I'm originally from England and of a mainstream demographic - so no obvious Republican, Muslim, Palestinian, Irish, Israeli ties or anything like that.  If that's too vague and enigmatic then I'd point out that it's hardly restricted information that [Martin McGuinness](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/1303355.stm), former IRA commander with a seat on the Republican Council, is now deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland and an MP for Sinn Fein.  That Gerry Adams was a Chief of Staff, or how the Good Friday Agreement came about. That's about as far as I'm willing to go with regards to paranoid me.  It's an anonymous person on the Internet so either take it or leave it, but the actual narrative/argument isn't dependent on who I am, nor should it be.  Let the documented history stand for itself.

For a while there was a very strange situation where Sinn Fein leaders couldn't have their voices broadcast in the UK or Ulster (Northern Ireland), so whenever the BBC wanted to report on a [Gerry Adams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Adams#Voice_ban) speech they had to dub over his voice and have an actor read his words.  The IRA and Sinn Fein link is daubed indelibly in the British consciousness.  It is this that the [Downing Street Declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street_Declaration) looked to address by establishing that Sinn Fein and the IRA would be treated separately.  Five years later there was the Good Friday Agreement on the back of the Downing St Declaration, five years after that and Northern Ireland paramilitaries were disarming.  US intermediary [George Mitchell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_J._Mitchell#Northern_Ireland_peace_process) himself pushed that whilst the UK had recognised a need to allow Sinn Fein to the table that to allow the PIRA to continue attacks at the time of talks was unacceptable.  Pressing for a denunciation of the armed campaign a compromise was stuck with the Provisional IRA agreeing to a long term ceasefire whilst Sinn Fein represented the Republican cause in talks.  The two very much went  [hand in hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army#Peace_strategy).

An introductory and fair review of the troubles from the start of the Provisional IRA is found in Peter Taylor's documentary series *'Provos: The IRA and Sinn Fein'*, with several former IRA members and Republicans providing candid interviews.   You'll find them all on YouTube:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gua3WJKdoSg

It's not really a case of analysing Sinn Fein this way; Sinn Fein itself issued and continues to host IRA statements on its own political party website.  They're not being subtle, they even have an image of the Bobby Sands mural on their 'History' page who was a well known IRA member before being elected an MP whilst still in prison, their own history as described by themselves is one in hand with the IRA:

http://www.sinnfein.ie/ira-statements        
http://www.sinnfein.ie/history

[The documentary series I linked to really talks more about Sinn Fein starting in episode 2, but I've linked to episode 1 as a back story is crucial.  The other episodes can be found in the YouTube sidebar. Wiki links in the comment  obviously come with their own reference links and should be checked.]",0,1353484531,null,0,1353523179,0,c74n0xn,t3_13ikzo,t1_c74n0xn,t1_c74ici0,null,1430462938,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

&gt;The FTT is essentially a tax on London

No, the FTT is a tax on transactions. Just because coincidentally a lot of financial services are concentrated in London does not mean that this tax is designed to hit the UK. There's also a tax on alcohol, but you don't hear France or Italy whine that their wineries are being targeted.

&gt;has been tried out in Sweden before (failed massively) 

Sweden wasn't a center so the costs to relocate the transactions were practically nihil.

&gt;It's bad for business

All taxes are bad for business, it's time to distribute the burden rather than letting workers pay almost all taxes and financials almost nothing.

&gt; it's a tax which predominantly affects the UK

Qui, réellement, était dans la provocation ? Les chrétiens qui prônent l'ignorance et l'obscurantisme ou les gens qui militent pour leurs droits fondamentaux ?

D'ailleurs, historiquement, on voit bien qu'il y a peu de groupes plus haineux et violents que les Chrétiens, qui sont constamment dans la contradiction.

The Arab Peace Initiative asks only for international law to be observed and it was successful in bringing not only Palestine, but Hamas too, and the Lebanon, into agreement.  That would be first.  Accept roundtable talks where 22 Arab nations offer to sit shoulder to shoulder, not opposite, Israel.  That'd be first.


&gt;You cannot trust anyone. 

No, *you* cannot trust anyone and yet Martin McGuinness and Iain Paisley who were bitter enemies became known as the 'chuckle brothers' when they eventually came together after the Good Friday Agreement.  The point being at some time you have to level some trust at someone you might not want to.  That's where peace happens.

&gt; In the past, on many occasions, land has been given back to the neighbouring countries in exchange for peace, an agreement which would be broken again within years.

Throwing piecemeal and then taking more is no argument.  International law is clear.  You can't take two thirds and then offer an eighth and presume to be the good guy.  The Arab League doesn't claim the whole, or even expect the right to return to be recognised 100%, but it does expect international law to be a foundation stone.

Who else is left that is big enough to stand up to those? Poland is large but still relatively poor and gets a lot of handouts from the EU, the remaining countries and many of the UKs natural allies in the EU are small, Denmark, Netherlands, Czech  et al.

So, while the UK can find allies and has done so in the past they are frequently out-manoevered because the scale of their alliance is dwared by the combination of France, Spain and Italy. Even a cursory look at EU internal conflict shows this to be true, 

Germany will often bicker with France and use the Uk et al as bargaining chip but until very recently Germany would soften and agree with France for the sake of ""solidarity"" and in fairness they do have a largely agreeable shared goal of Federalism something the UK has never been keen on. 

The problem is not that there is a Big 3, but that there is a Massive 6 (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland) with half of them natural allies.

Là mon ami, tu te trompes d'interlocuteur. La violence est fasciste car elle force. C'est ça le fascisme. Loin de moi l'idée d'en venir à une référence Nazi. C'est pas trop mon genre de rhétorique. 

Un rassemblement homophobe qui milite pour garder une partie des citoyens dans une zone de seconde classe, est par définition fasciste car il bloque les droits à l'égalité. L'idéologie qui rassemble ces gens est fasciste en soit car elle tente d'assigner, par une adresse, une identité sur une partie de sa population en utilisant une stratégie basée sur des sophismes. Et qui plus est, on détourne l'attention du public en utilisant l'image de la petite enfance, sans aucune données, sans aucune preuves autres que des croyances obscurantistes. C'est la plus grande fumisterie jamais utilisée en matière de militantisme anti-mariage pour conjoints de même sexes.

Je comprends la logique derrière ton argument, que c'était de la provocation facile, mais cela n'excuse pas la violence qui en est découlée. Ça ne l'excuse pas et ne la justifie pas. La violence, elle vient d'abord et avant tout de l'oppresseur homophobe. Ce sont eux les fachos.

That is all this about. There is no real chance that the rebate will be reduced, it is just a simple negotiation tactic regarding the budget.

However, it is also a really really stupid one. If the UK is threatened so directly, it will dig its heels in and push back. That may be in the EU's interests, however it also might not given that it feeds into the stigma the EU already holds within the British press.

What I found interesting was that this news comes after Cameron had already signalled that he was considering agreeing to the rise. Given that this is the case, it pretty much forces Cameron to veto to save face at home - he will not wish to appear to be bullied by the EU. I also happen to have a nasty suspicion, that this may now be exactly the outcome that is being designed, thus using the UK as a scapegoat.

EDIT: Another way of seeing it, perhaps, is that the EU is sneakily giving Cameron a chance to appear good at home by 'saving the rebate', hoping that the press will ignore the relatively small increase in the budget for the better news that the rebate is safe.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"Although I consider myself an environmentalist, I'm always suspicious of organizations like Greenpeace, because I find that they are frequently quite scientifically illiterate, which is a great shame. This chart is at least somewhat misleading, because, from their technical report:

&gt; NPEs were the most commonly detected substances, identified in 89 of the 141 articles (63% of the total). **NPE
concentrations ranged from just above 1 mg/kg up to 45 000 mg/kg.** One fifth (20%) of the samples contained
NPEs at concentrations above 100 mg/kg. Of this 20%, 12 samples (9% of articles tested) showed
concentrations over 1 000 mg/kg (0.1% by mass),

So a 'positive NPE test' includes 1 mg/kg in the same category as 45 000 mg/kg. There are two ways to look at this. Firstly, as far as I can see they're not explicitly making any claims that NPEs are toxic to humans, but it is strongly implied. It is almost always the case that toxicity depends on concentration, so in terms of any toxic effect in humans, the distinction between 1 and 45,000 mg/kg is absolutely enormous.

Secondly, the actual point of the report (although it's barely mentioned in the press release) seems to be about aquatic toxicity in waste water, from washing clothes than contain NPEs. It seems that Nonylphenol ethoxylates will wash off, and degrade to Nonylphenol, which is persistent and bioaccumulative, and toxic for aquatic lifeforms. That means that low concentrations are still relevant, although of course higher concentrations are still far more important. To take a very simple approach, one kg of t-shirts that wash off 45 000 mg/kg would be equivalent to 45 tonnes of t-shirts that wash off 1 mg/kg. 

As far as I can see, they also do nothing to quantify what the other sources of NPEs are in the environment. It seems from a bit of googling that they're used as detergents in some countries, or even sprayed on forests as herbicides. If that's the case, this source is going to be completely trivial. All in all, the report strikes me as not a very serious attempt to solve the problem.

The Matrix is good, but it didn't push the genre forward in the way Metropolis did. It had great SFX, a pseudo-philosophical story, and average-at-best acting. It was a very good film, but, in my opinion, not a great one.

La conséquence pour le consommateur est la même, mais dans un cas on cherche volontairement à diminuer la durée de vie, dans l'autre ça n'est que la conséquence de choix industriels.",0,1353536029,null,0,false,0,c74x63n,t3_13f1he,t1_c74x63n,t1_c73p8n8,null,1430467922,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1
true,jjungsch,null,null,"I'm American, and yes Thanksgiving is huge here.  People get off from school and work and it is one of the biggest traveling periods with people visiting family.  The tradition is to come together with loved ones and have a huge feast which is supposed to represent the coming together of Native Americans and Pilgrims when America was first founded.  Its based on a very premodern, religious idea (which ignores the whole part of European settlers massacring the natives), but like all things people have taken their own view on Thanksgiving.    

Also people are huge here, and this holiday is literally about stuffing yourself.
