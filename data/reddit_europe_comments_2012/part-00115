true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;There definitely will be a treaty change, the problem is that...

No, not in this decade, and probably not in the next one, at least not in the EU, and I doubt very much in the Eurozone. Whether you are pro it or not, even a change where everyone is positive, would take a minumum of 3-4 years, since it would have to be voted through in several parlaments, and national constitutions have to be changed. 

Well, since hell hasn't frozen over, many of the non Eurozone states will emphathetically say no, with all their might, and that means that it is left to the Eurozone countries to form a tighter union. 

What does that mean? If we ignore all the EU problems that would follow and just concentrate on the Eurozone, it would mean, some sort of federal state where the ""superstate"" would rule over the current national state, in other words, sovereignit would be handed over to the ""superstate"". 

The reasone for this is of course (among others) financial. If the EZ are pooling debt, the EZ need to control the resources, to put it simple, or, as you put it, serious amounts of money. 

For this to happen there need to be a handing over of sovereignity. In the future, the Germans and the Dutch, might tell the French to cut down on their nuclear arms, because they are to expensive, or the Finns to raise their pension age to 70. That is not unreasonable, the budget will be overseen by a superstate. The debt, as well as the recources will be controlled by the superstate. It means for example, that every country (on average) in the Eurozone will have a debt of 91 %. That might be very good for the Greeks, but one doesn't have to be a True Finn to object to that raise of Finnish debt. 

All the states in the Eurozone will have to hand over that sovereignity, and no matter how fast, it will take a few years due to voting. When the Finns vote in 2014, I can hear my arguments echoing from the anti EU Finns. You don't have to like them, but the arguments will be there, pointing at Sweden who are doing better at the moment btw. Are you sure that the Finns are OK with giving up their independence, raising their debt a lot and start paying for others? Don't you think the anti- federalists will put up the fight of their life? I do, in every country. And, yes, in France and Germany too. When the French realise just how much they will have to give up, it will not be easy. And, in every country, it will be stalled and dragged through every court, and governments will fall. Does that mean that there will never be a federal superstate? No, perhaps it will happen. Will it solve any of the problems at the moment - no, even when everyone is OK with it (which will not be the case) it will still take a minimum of 4-5 years. 

So, my point is, solve the current problem now, the depression/recession/crises in the Eurozone, and perhaps, slowly start talking about a federal Europe, but don't put any energy in it, it will not happen for years, and probably not for decades.

Normally on an issue like this I'd weigh up media reports with other trustworthy sources and try to come to my own opinion, but it seems that there is often so much said about this conflict from so many perspectives and I end up just feeling sad. Nobody should be a second class citizen in their own hometown (or anywhere, ideally) but I find it hard to believe that your average Israeli is an oppressor. I suspect there's one hell of a lot of propaganda going around on every side, and I doubt many of the political leaders on all sides truly have the interests of their own people at heart...

Well, I suppose you are talking about the Maastrich treaty, and I don't see how that matters, no one is following it anyway. 

If she want to change how the ECB works, why don't you just call a meeting for the Eurozone, it is not like anyone is going to listen to Bulgaria and Sweden anyway. 

Also, still, to change a treaty it will take years, since the national parlaments will have to vote about it, even if it's just in the Eurozone (and if it is, why call a EU meeting). I can also assure you, that some countries will probably vote no (mine for example) if we are talking about the EU, not to mention the UK. 

Why don't they go ahead to do what they already do, ignore the treaties and the law, it is not like they are following it.  

&gt;Not to mention that there will be another Europe wide banking crisis in next ten years if ECB and the union doesn't get more power, hint SEPA is a really big thing in the future.

It depends on the banks of course, and how they are regulated. One doesn't need the Eurozone to regulate the banks, Sweden and Denmark are doing just fine. 

&gt;Pooling of debt on the other hand is not a solution and will not be suggested.

It has been suggested, that is what Eurobonds means among other things, and of course it will be suggested, but maybe not to the full extent.

&gt;What Europe needs is more market orientated policies and usually every treaty change has progressed them. 

I don't really see that? Wouldn't that suggest then, that the countries in the Eurozone are more market oriented than the countries outside? What I see is the effort of individual countries, like Estonia (in the EZ) and Poland (outside), but I don't see the Eurozone making a difference, albeit negative, for example comparing Finland/Sweden.

No, as Burma is a sovereign state. Next question? I can only assume you're deliberately pretending to not understand what im talking about as a way of avoiding the question.

&gt;The Palestinian territories are like a concentration camp in the same way the desert is like an ocean but with less water.

Palestine is like a concentration camp in that the population is forced to live in poor conditions (often shanty towns) having their homes, farms, and infrastructure regularly destroyed. Their arable land is seized by militant Zionist settlers (who the state of Israel claims not to endorse, but I see fuck all being done about it). To pass from district to district you have to pass through multiple checkpoints, any one of which can deny you access without any reason. You can be detained indefinitely. Israel holds all of the high ground in Gaza with hilltop ""Settlements"" from which Israeli Militants descend into Palestinian territory often killing civilians.

The only way it isn't a Giant concentration camp is that the Palestinians are given the option to leave their homes with nothing. They cannot sell their homes, they can't take their possessions or livelihood with them.  

If you STILL cannot find that comprehensible then I urge you to seek professional help. I have now repeated the same thing in THREE posts to you, and you haven't addressed the issues at hand once.

Firstly that is what is known as a ""Straw man argument"", as if I needed any further proof you were under the age of 16.

Secondly no I am not fucking saying that. I am saying what I said. Which was, if you recall (I know children find it hard to concentrate) That Burma is a sovereign state not repressing another states people to the benefit of its own.

* An organisation with more than 200 stakeholders to please is almost certain to be ineffective. 

* The UN itself has very little actual power, and mirrors exactly the divisions of the world that it represents.

* There is so much red tape, inefficiency, and layers of bureaucracy inside the organisation, you start to wonder if it is by design, and the design is to be ineffective

* Likewise rules often make no sense, are hard even for long-term staff to understand, and are changed or reversed frequently

* The UN is full of young people who are keen and eager to make a difference, and cynical world-weary elders who have given up and keep their heads down

* The upper echelons of the UN, i.e. the posts where there is any power, are all politically appointed. This is not a recipe for efficiency or people who have the best interests of the organisation at heart

* The middle to higher levels of the UN are spectacularly well paid. This may encourage a mind-set where people “sell-out” to protect and perpetuate their own privilege

* It is almost impossible to fire incompetent staff without proof of gross misconduct

* Although certainly not alone, the US is constantly meddling with the UN, and uses its large share of the organisation’s dues, and the withholding of such, as weapon to get what it wants

* Fox News and the Republican Party actively watch the UN for any semblance of scandal or misconduct to use in pushing their blatantly anti-UN agenda 

* The current Secretary-General is inept and powerless even by UN standards, and was presumably chosen for precisely this reason, as it is said that his predecessor showed a little too much spine and independence of thought over the war in Iraq

* There is persistent speculation that the most competent, progressive and independently minded Secretary-General to date, Dag Hammarskjöld, was assassinated

* I would take exception with the assertion that it is only UNESCO that does much good.

Why do Palestinians expect more from Israel than from their  Muslim ""brothers""? After all, don't Palestinians consider Israelis to be their enemies?

&gt; The borders are completely shut down by Israel. 

Are you geographically-challenged? There are land borders too. 

&gt; This is fucking textbook circular logic. The reason the Palestinians are launching Rockets 

I didn't ask you why Palestinians are launching Rockets, I asked you if Israel has the right to defend itself.

&gt; Firstly that is what is known as a ""Straw man argument""

No, you claimed Burma can't be considered a concentration camp because it's a sovereign state, like sovereignty is magical or something. 

&gt; That Burma is a sovereign state not repressing another states people to the benefit of its own.

By the same reasoning, as I previously stated, if Israel annexes the Palestinian territories they would magically stop to be a concentration camp.

&gt; Neither side is innocent and both sides are animated with a thoroughly unhealthy religious zeal that will ensure it will never end until one race of people is killed.

There is no parity, one side is clearly more religious.

&gt; Both sides use the excuse of the other's aggression to push an agenda of complete annihilation.

Can you provide evidence showing that Israeli officials want to exterminate the Palestinians?

Why? Is something wrong with being a Gypsy?


&gt; Romania has a population of 22 million, out of which less than 2% is of other origin, including gypsies.

Are you sure about that? This [map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Roma_in_Europe_2007_map-de.svg/2000px-Roma_in_Europe_2007_map-de.svg.png) disagrees, clearly 2.4 million Romas single-handedly make more than 2% of Romanian population.

&gt;  However, a group of gypsies which represents less than 2% of the population 

See above.

&gt; Not realizing doing this is the same as saying that France is a muslim country full of criminal Algerians and Moroccans, because the number of ethnical French people of African origin far outshines the number of gypsies in Romania, as a percentage of the population. 

I don't think so, more than 1 in 10 Romanians is Roma, I don't think that's the case with Muslims in France.

&gt;  The fact that Romania is and has always been a Francophone country, has always put great value in French culture, is the only country in Europe to adopt the French constitution and the French penal code as their own.

So Romania was for all intents and purposes a French colony in Europe, right? And you're proud of that?

&gt; Bucharest was called ""Little Paris"", the relations between the countries were really good, scholars travelled back and forth the two and many Romanians spoke a perfect French.


Wasn't the relation pretty one-sided and rather paternalistic in nature? How many Frenchmen spoke Romanian?

&gt; It's sad to see all that crumble, because a group of people are mistakenly considered Romanians.


Well, they're Romanian citizens.

&gt; The difference between Romanians and Rroma people can't be further away from any point of view.

How is that possible? Haven't Romanians and Romas coexisted for almost 1000 years?

&gt; Genetically

Well, Romanians probably have the largest [South Asian admixture](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Ish7688voT0/TNp5D246VkI/AAAAAAAAC3s/n7oKVNyBZbE/s1600/ADMIXTURE10.png) of all people in Europe.

&gt;Romania has a population of 22 million, out of which less than 2% is of other origin, including gypsies. 

That's bullshit. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania#Demographic_evolution

According to provisional data from 2011 census, Romania's population is 19,042,936.[...] In October 2011 Romanians made up 88.6% of the population. The largest ethnic minorities are the Hungarians, who make up 6.5% of the population and Gypsies, who make up 3.2% of the population.

Given that a lot of Roma do not identify as such, and some estimates put them at around 10%, the percentage of Romanians might actually be lower

&gt;It's sad to see all that crumble, because a group of people are mistakenly considered Romanians.

Somebody mentioned recently that the vast majority of French people do know the distinction between Roma and Romanian.

A really simple explanation: They probably also tested some Roma. Also, other countries with high percent of Roma ar missing from you chart (like Hungary, Bulgaria). Actually, Romania is the only eastern european/balkan country from the list.

- a shitty educational system (now as well as in the past)

- the fact that some people will not have any context to use Romanian, as their low mobility never takes them outside Szekler Land. As we know, a language not practiced tends to be forgotten

Wrong. Some call themselves Gypsies - mostly Romanian-speaking Roma - , some call themselves Roma.

Here in Central/Eastern Europe, an unsettling amount of people don't seem to have particularly stopped hating Jews at all ... never mind that there are relatively few of them actually left.

In Western Europe, the reduction of overt anti-semitism has little to do with the Jews' willingness to integrate - or anything to do with how the Jews themselves behave at all - but with one word only: Holocaust. There are only minimal Jewish populations left since WW2.

I used to work for a bookstore chain that has bookstores in both Oradea and Cluj (among other cities) and trust me, you will find books at ridiculous discounts even in the big-name bookstores. It’s because the publishers dictate the prices and, as of late, they change the price for the entire printing of a book. I believe Polirom started selling “1 Euro books” a few years back and other publishers followed suit, having dozens of titles for 5, 10 or 15 lei (usually for hardcover books). If I’m not mistaken, Polirom adds new titles for the 5/10 lei discount each week; other publishers don't have such a clockwork timing for discounts even though they have dozens of titles as well. Other publishers with entire printings on discount are [Nemira] (http://www.nemira.ro/carti-10,-15-si-20-lei/pe-stoc), [Humanitas] (http://www.libhumanitas.ro/promotii/humanitas-reduceri-5-si-10-lei.html), [Corint/Leda] (http://www.grupulcorint.ro/magazin/) (scrolll to the bottom of the page), Trei, Art…and pretty much every big publisher out there. (Except for RAO, last I checked they weren’t big on the discount train). You can find them pretty much all the time in bookstores so it's not a 'sale' kind of thing; they are available as long as the printing is in stock.

Even though libraries are still the best choice, cost-wise, I do suggest trying a bookstore nearby and asking for the discount section; it should be very well stocked. :)",0,1346238030,null,0,false,0,c60f0wy,t3_z0eou,t1_c60f0wy,t1_c60ek7l,null,1429764488,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

It is a historic fact that post revolution what would replace it, and whom, was far from decided.  If you want to ignore that, fine.  Rewrite history.  It doesn't even change the self evident point in Syria - it was just an example as to how nobody can know what will follow a revolution.

When you argue that the only legitimate outcome is the toppling of a government, then provide an alternative legitimate outcome of the Syrians choosing an Assad government, as well as being provided with several alternatives, and then back flip again to say they must be prosecuted - who's going to arrest him if he's an elected government?  Why is it a pre-requisite to elections that Assad be removed?  It wasn't in Palestine.  Egypt had referendums.  You're just making stuff up now:  'Only legitimate outcome'....'prerequisites'....suchabody may stand but not somebody else.

Who are you to say what can and cannot be done and what is and what isn't an acceptable outcome?

You're just providing a poor man's argument for yet another invasion without weighing up any consequences and based on a lot of self decree and assumption.

It's simple, if Syrians want to topple a government, Syrians must do it.  If the surrounding Arabic countries are concerned and want to bring it to an end or to contain it - they have plenty of capacity and the surrounding Arabic countries and the Arab League must do it.

In my opinion it's pretty clear that the Palestinians are in no position to make their acceptance of a solution conditional on that any more, but it seems like if they can't get the Temple Mount, they'd rather try to fight it out and hope to be helped/rescued by Arab states.",0,1346251196,null,0,1346251741,0,c60h9pm,t3_yzbl2,t1_c60h9pm,t1_c60gc1a,null,1429765553,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

This might work if there were no agressive oponents on the ""opressed"" side. But let's face it there are a lot of Palestinians preparing and fighting a war as well. Most of the dicussions about the middle east try to figure out who did what and when, to get an idea who the ""bad guys"" are and whos killings are thereby legit.

What they really need are groups on both sides who stand up against their respective warlords. Israelis should fight against apartheid and opression of palestinians and the palestinians should fight the extremists on their side. As long as either one side consider themselves victims there will never be peace, because you first have to consider yourselve a victim to become an offender (or you're just flat out mentally ill).

I'll grant you this one.

&gt; Reduced currency risks

My understanding is that it lowers some currency risks (businesses can plan more easily if they can source from more same-currency vendors, etc.) and *increases* others (you can end up with an inappropriate monetary policy and exchange rate, like what got Spain into the trouble they're in). 

Don't the recent experiences of Iceland, the UK, and Sweden (who are glad they're not in the Euro), and Spain, Ireland, and Greece (who should rue the day they joined the Euro) give you pause on the idea that joining the Euro ""lowers risk""?

&gt; Increased geopolitical security

You really think that's normal? If Muslims came to your country in the same manner, would you welcome them with open arms? Remember that Hitler offered the US and many other European countries to take the Jews, but all of them refused:

&gt;I can only hope and expect that the other world, which has such deep sympathy for these criminals [Jews], will at least be generous enough to convert this sympathy into practical aid. We, on our part, are ready to put all these criminals at the disposal of these countries, for all I care, even on luxury ships. --Hitler

Just imagine if every European country took a couple of thousand Jews, the world could have avoided such a horrendous act that will forever stain human history.

One Palestinian Nazi. That's it. With superficial research, I can name tens of Nazis from each European country that ever existed. Also, as I've said, natives of Palestine and Jews (who were also natives, aka Old Yishuv) lived in relative peace throughout history. It's only until the successive aliyahs that the situation deteriorated. Also, most scholars agree that anti semitism in the Arab and Muslim world was much less than severe than that in Europe. Sure many Palestinians and Arabs are anti semitic holocaust deniers (I'm neither), but please understand that this came after the declaration of Israel and the numerous wars that were fought with the Arab countries.

Whoever is in military control of a piece of land is the one who has the right to it. Palestinians need to realize how much is realistic to ask for given their current situation (probably nothing near Jerusalem at all) and then stick to that without further violence.

It should be noted that I think Israel is also acting in extremely bad faith by aggressively building settlements on occupied, contested ground. For what seems to be very little gain it completely ruins any chance of peace. It seems obvious that it cannot really be about space to build homes, but is rather a political statement and a way of gradually pushing Palestinians out of the areas. My personal opinion is that they are probably trying to make neighboring states finally assimilate the Palestinians.

I think there is a lot of diplomatic points to be gained for whoever seizes these ridiculous actions.

Yep it was a desert. That's why Ben-Gurion wanted to make use of the fellahin (farmers), because they were sitting on their asses not planting anything.
&gt;When purchasing land, Jewish migrants were concerned with the displacement of fellahin, agricultural laborers who cultivated the land. ""In 1920, Labor Zionist leader David Ben-Gurion expressed his concern about the Arab fellahin, whom he viewed as 'the most important asset of the native population'. Ben-Gurion said 'under no circumstances must we touch land belonging to the fellahs or worked by them'""

&gt;Yes, it's normal and I'd welcome Muslims here. Except for Salafist scum, of course.

You're probably the only one in Europe. Just remember that the population from 1890 to 1931 ranged from 500K to 1mill, so ten thousand every year can really make a difference. It's like a 100,000 Muslims coming to Sweden every year (population of Sweden is around 10mill).

Sehr gute Aktion und der Begründung ist nicht hinzuzufügen. Die Eiche gilt als deutscher Nationalbaum und wird häufig in der Heraldik (Wappenkunde) benutzt, ausgerechnet ein solches Zeichen zu setzen ist in der Tat ein Schlag ins Gesicht der Opfer.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Yes, I know about Germany and France in 2003-5. IMO, it was a mistake not to take on the fines and set a positive example.

Of course it was. I suppose you are referring to the convergence criteria. What Germany and France did was minor, very minor, in the grand scheme of things, although it was wrong. I assume you have read them, and among other things, they say that the debt shouldn't be more of 60 % of GDP, one should never have a budget deficit of more than 3 % and not an inflation more than 1,5 % more than the 3 best performing states. If you didn't fulfill these criteria, you would not be let in or fined. That means tht Italy, Greece and Belgium wouldn't be in the Euro from start. Looking at the other criterias, only 3 countries have fulfilled them every year, Luxemburg, Estonia and Finland. All other countries should be fined and/or thrown out. 

And, I haven't even started to discuss the fact that according to ECB standards, ECB shouldn't bail out indivudual countries, all countries are responsible for their own debt, and no country should bail out another. 

&gt;This treaty is currently the LAW. If people aren't following it now, maybe they should, like, start following it

Well, yes - are you? Then start with throwing out/fining all countries with a debt over 60 % and stop all aid - immediately......

No, of course not, that would be ridiculous, wouldn't it? A union consisting of Estonia, Finland and Luxemburg? 

My point is, that no one has followed the law, at all. Personally, I think it is wrong, but one has to be realistic. To claim that you will start follow odd parts of it, is very hypocritical, and ridiculous. Follow it to the letter, or, as I think I do, take a more realistic approach, and say, in time write a new one, but don't claim to follow any law or treaty, because you are not. To refer to the Maastrich treaty when exactly 3 countries are following it, and no one the ECB criterias, is ludicrouse , but that is what he (and Merkel) did.

&gt;Frankly, that's a pretty disgusting point of view and probably what got us into this mess in the first 

I am Swedish, we have always followed the Maastrich criteria and we have not caused this mess. Personally I think that the way the Euro countries are behaving is criminal. That is not however, a very constructive point, and that is why I am also suggesting to pick a few paragraphs out of the treaty is hopeless, stop pretending you are following it, because you are not.

Right - that's why you suggested deportation or jail as alternative to genocide.

&gt;I'm talking about a serious issue and you're being a retard. Good going. Perhaps one day you'll have a problem with gypsies so that you'll stop playing it off and joking about it as if it was a light matter.

Oh come off your frigging high horse. You're Portuguese! I'm in Hungary, I have Roma living in my building. There's Roma out on the streets all around here. In the evening they play music in the park in front of my house. I have a couple of half-Roma friends. I have a bunch of stuff in my back room from a friend's Roma friend who got homeless when the organization she worked for and whose offices she lived in went broke. (And no, it's not stolen stereos or whatever your fevered mind might come up with - it's books.) On top of that I've been proud to have been involved in a large study about Roma and education.

The tax policy has always been his main selling point but he's now much more dogmatic and so much less ambitious. The EU referendum, Roma, nuclear power and others cabinet disagreements are actually a trademark of socialists in power. While the French right tends to lend too much credit to a single authoritarian boss, the French left is a world champion of infighting (there are already signs of a renewal of the classic struggle between the ""true"" left and ""treacherous"" social democrats). These points are also a result of the fuzzy stance Hollande himself took on all those issues while campaigning and on his assumed style of government. It leaves space for personal interpretation by his ministers who can pander to their respective political clients.

The fact that he's already below 50% after not doing much while Sarkozy reached the same level 4 months later than Hollande after introducing some major (if disputed) reforms is actually a telling sign of two things:

The University of Iceland had to increase annual registration fee from 40.000 ISK to 65.000 ISK (164 Euros to 266 Euros), along with making some cuts in services like opening hours on some buildings, charging for mark-up exams (which used to be free) and even considering limiting the amount of students in fields like Engineering (which hasn't had any restrictions, half the students flunk out in the first year anyway.) Student loans have been increased, to reflect the heightened cost of living.

I worked for a hospital last summer, but I was officially payed directly by the government as the position I worked was created by a government project that funds various institutions/foundations to create jobs for students over the summer. I would've probably been unemployed this summer without it. The hospital was obviously under some restrictions, although they did renovate some parts while I was there. Most people didn't work full jobs, some departments where even closed for 3 days a week and some people rarely worked a full workday. The hospital isn't allowed to pay some employees for overtime, which was really bad for morale as some people have to work overtime to do their jobs. That all said I didn't notice any severe cuts that affected patients, just a series of inconveniences. 

A relative of mine works for one of the Major electrical companies in Iceland (A Semi-Public company). They've stopped hiring temp employees over the summer (trench-diggers and errand runners and such). Partly because they can't really afford them, but mostly because there isn't anything to do for them.

EU ministers dont want full political integration yet because there is a lack of support amongst certain states and I think they want to move forward together. If polls are anything to go by there is stronger support in the younger demographics, and so I imagine any political union post crisis would occur in maybe 10 or 20 years. The press in europe is far too free to consider a political union as a realistic opportunity in the current climate, and people really wouldn't be down with that right now.

What has to be done though is a centralisation of financial powers at an EU level with a necessary step in democratising the whole system. I think this will require a new treaty, but I think should the necessary voting powers and generally, power of decision, should it be given to the parliament people will be more for this new treaty. Most opinion polls are showing around 50% support in most countries for the EU, with the UK/Czech/Austria being the main opponents (although saying that support has increased).

Dadurch geht die eigentliche Aussage, die Botschaft, die vermittelt werden sollte, völlig unter. Eigentlich sollte ja darauf aufmerksam gemacht werden,

Dem kann man zustimmen oder auch nicht, je nachdem, welche Meinung man dazu vertritt, aber offensichtlich ist ja wohl, dass die Aktion nicht nur gescheitert ist, sondern sogar negative Auswirkungen hatte. Die Botschaft geht unter und die ""Aktionsgruppe"" wird als Außenseitervereinigung, bestehend aus Chaoten, dargestellt (was im Angesicht dieser unsinnigen Aktion wahrscheinlich sogar richtig ist).

Alternative Möglichkeiten um Aufmerksamkeit zu wecken und Veränderungen anzustoßen sind reichlich vorhanden. Besonders vernünftig finde ich hierbei vor allem den Post von [Pfeffersack](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/z0n51/antifaschisten_f%C3%A4llen_friedenseiche_in_rostock/c60pbv3) (auch wenn ich nicht mit allen seinen Meinungen übereinstimme), der uns daran erinnert, dass die effektivste Art für Wandel in der Gesellschaft die ""parlamentspolitische Beteiligung"" ist. Das System von Innen heraus zum Besseren zu verändern ist gesellschaftlich akzeptierter, erfolgsversprechender und zudem nachhaltiger, als mit Nacht-und-Nebel-Aktionen und Bekennerschreiben einzelne Ausrufezeichen zu setzen.

Zum Schluss sollte nochmal zu Bedenken gegeben werden, dass diejenigen, die die Eiche gepflanzt, haben durchaus gute Absichten hatten.

Das Argument, es handele sich bei der gepflanzten Eiche um ein ""Symbol für Deutschtümelei und Militarismus"", kann ich aus einer bestimmten Sichtweise nachvollziehen, aber nicht unterstützen. Zum einen hat die Eiche (wie oben erwähnt) schon seit viel längerer Zeit eine positive Bedeutung. Ihre Verbindung mit Deutschtum und Militarismus ist zwar vorhanden, aber bei langem nicht der einzige oder der ursprüngliche Aspekt. (Der Argumentationsweise der Aktionsgruppe folgend, wären alle Autobahnen ein Symbol für Nazionalsozialismus und das Dritte Reich, nur weil unter den Anweisungen Hitlers besonders viele davon gebaut und propagandistisch ausgenutzt wurden.) Zum anderen wurde die Eiche mit der expliziten Absicht gepflanzt, eine Botschaft des Friedens und der Versöhnung zu verbreiten.

Value chains cross borders, in case of Finland and Sweden our industrial value chains are highly linked with Germany and the rest of the central Europe. Even in case of Sweden transaction costs are lowered for example when Swedish company buys components/parts from Germany and then sells them back to the Eurozone, there is reduced transaction costs and lowered currency risk.

&gt; How? You have higher interest rates now than Sweden, Denmark, less control, have to borrow more and aid other countries more. Haven't your costs increased as well? 

The interest rates are a non-issue when they are this low. When we talk about currency risk we talk about a sudden fall or surge of the value of currency, for example due to speculative attack that took BoE out in the 90s.

&gt; I can understand being part of the EU, given Finland's history with Russia, but how is Finland more secure as a Euromember, as opposed to a EU member? 

Because with Euro you have something valuable that you share and that you could all loose. In case of the EU, what you share is a common market, something based on legislation and common will to work things out, in case of Euro you have something that is very tangible.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt;  My understanding is that it lowers some currency risks (businesses can plan more easily if they can source from more same-currency vendors, etc.) and increases others (you can end up with an inappropriate monetary policy and exchange rate, like what got Spain into the trouble they're in). 

Inappropriate monetary policy only does damage when you combine it with inappropriate government spending. For example in Spain and Ireland the public sector should have actively cooled the economy by cutting down public investment, by slowing new city planning, by increasing restrictions for banks to loan money, etc... In case of Euro because countries can't set their interest and inflation rates, it is very important public spending and wage increases are negotiated accordingly to the economic situation in hand.

&gt; Don't the recent experiences of Iceland, the UK, and Sweden (who are glad they're not in the Euro), and Spain, Ireland, and Greece (who should rue the day they joined the Euro) give you pause on the idea that joining the Euro ""lowers risk""?

Not really. In case of lowered risk we need to remember that it is the private sector that benefits from it. And in case of system risks, like what we are happening, it is the state that is carrying the burden. However there are always risks in any system, you just have to deal with them.

&gt; I have not thought about this one at all. Could you explain more what you mean by this? Does this mean that Finland is somehow less likely to be invaded by the Russian Army or something if it is in a currency union with France and Germany? (I admit ignorance of Finland's geopolitical security situation).

In short yes, and further integration with central Europe will drive this. You might ask shouldn't we have then a bigger army or ally with NATO, and to this I have to answer that security is balancing act. If Finland would arm itself to the teeth or ally with NATO, it would scare of the Russians, and that is something that we don't want to do.

I'd say 9,5 Million people is easily large enough to be a considerable sample, and thus breed plenty of variety in thought.

I agree that Sweden is far more homogeneous than the US, but you mustn't view it as some sort of entirely similar entity. Roughly 14-15% of Sweden's population is foreign born (Norway has a similar rate), and that's not counting those born to foreign parents. According to Mr. Wikipedia the foreign born % of the US population is roughly 13%.
Naturally this doesn't take into consideration that the US has, historically, a far larger immigrant base, and has, statistically, a larger number of ethnic diversity.
Nevertheless, this whole idea that Sweden is one mono-cultural and ethnic entity is a myth - it's not.

true,kennon42,null,null,"A better question would be if Germans are happy paying high taxes to the EU ... since that is a MUCH better comparison to the USA.

It has everything to do with scale. In Germany (I'm an american expat here) you definitely get somewhat more of a sense that you're getting something back for your taxes. The country is the size of a largish US state and is (compared to the US) dramatically more homogenous. You pay your tax and can take advantage of lots of social services, etc.

In the US, you pay a big chunk of your paycheck to the IRS (federal government) and you get: foreign wars, global ""peace"", maybe medicare or medicaid if you are poor or old (and probably aren't paying taxes anyway). Most of the ""benefits"" of the federal government are diffuse and hard to see directly in your life (if they are benefits at all, but I'm a little bitter here). About the only concrete thing I can think of off the top of my head is the interstate system.

Most things that you see and feel and touch on a daily basis are paid for by the city or state you live in, and these things are mostly paid for by property or sales taxes (I only ever lived in states with no state income tax, so I don't know how the feeling would be elsewhere). Correspondingly I never had a problem paying local or state taxes since I knew full well that they were really, in fact, being mostly put to good use.

It's especially frustrating to me since I still have to declare all of my taxes to the IRS even though I've lived in Germany for a decade. I don't see ANY concrete benefits to paying federal taxes, but I'm required to do so anyway.

I think if Germans were paying much tax directly to the EU (a huge, diffuse geographical body) they would have a dramatically different opinion, as the general frustration with the situation with Greece shows.

Also, a sidenote: for what it's worth, German income tax is pretty much in line with US (federal) income tax, +- a couple of percent. The national VAT of 19% is twice as much as most sales taxes in the US, but property tax is in most places far lower.

true,Nimbal,GERM,Germany,"It's been a long time since I learned about this, so it may be inaccurate, but I'll try:

First and second votes are not completely independent. Direct candidates that won will use up one seat their party gained through the second vote.

For the sake of example, let's say the Bundestag has 100 seats. Party A wins 8 direct candidates and 20% of second votes. Party B wins 19 direct candidates and 15% of second votes. 

Now, party A is eligible for 20 seats. But 8 of those are already used by direct candidates, so party A receives those 8 seats plus 12 from their list.

Party B only won 15 seats, but 19 of their direct candidates won. All those 19 will gain a seat, but their party won't receive any more for their list candidates. They have 4 overhang seats.

For your question about the 5% clause, see this [Wikipedia page](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BCnf-Prozent-H%C3%BCrde_in_Deutschland), particularly this part:

&gt; Vereinigt ein Direktkandidat in einem Wahlkreis die Mehrheit der gültigen Erststimmen auf sich, erhält er ein Mandat, auch wenn seine Partei an der Fünf-Prozent-Hürde scheitert. 

So yes, the candidate will get a seat, even if their party won't. That's also one of the possible sources for overhang seats.

How to put it... solidarity is big in Scandinavia. However they have on the cultural level stayed quite old-fashioned conservative in the sense of sticking to old values like being cautious, being reliable, being hard-working, doing one's duty, so basically there are rules and limitations. There is a sense of patriotism and patriotistic duty, and although most people are atheist there is still a sense of cultural Christanity alive that reminds people of their civic duties.

Culturally they did not buy into the new liberalism or New Left-ism of the 1968 generation that you should be totally free and society setting barriers before you is oppressive and evil. They did not buy into this whole all power to the imagination thing.

I mean the American or British (New) Left generally bought into this ideology after 1968 that everything is the fault of the rich everybody else is good, every limitation is oppression by the rich and every talk of virtue or duty is just lies by the rich, and given that the rich oppress you, you are entitled to everything for free.

Scandinavia is more cautious, more old-fashioned in a good way, still believing duty matters, virtue matters, everybody must pull their weight, people who try to game the welfare system are rejected by their friends and shamed, people must be cautious and save money, the government must spend responsibly etc. etc.

How can one explain it... the main culture of American, British, French Leftism-Liberalism is basically like being a teenager rebelling against parental authority, right? But being a Scandinavian or also being German is like becoming that kind of well-adjusted kid your parents wanted you to be, who never litters, does the homework, gets a haircut, obeys the rules, does as told.

Private organizations/companies are usually about profit, which needs a basic level of greed. That's fine actually, that's how a market economy works. 

But in certain areas of society I don't want an economy driven by greed behind it. For example I want well paid, well educated and passionate teachers for everyone, because someday the kids they teach will pay for my retirement pension, they will be the doctors I will need when I have an illness, they will be the drivers of the emergency car that takes me to the hospital in case of an accident.

My taxes fund these teaches, my taxes fund public school. They don't have to get worried about being paid or losing their jobs because of cuts, they can focus on doing their job right. They may not be as good as the best ones available in the US, but on average they are better and available to everyone.

true,Britzer,null,null,"Wow, so much hate here. About the bad standard of living in the US, greedy Americans, no health care, etc. 

First of all: Our taxes are better hidden. It's as simple as that. Prices always include sales tax. So you don't see the 20% (1/5th) the state adds. Also most people don't do their taxes. Wage earners don't have to. Their employer takes care of that. A lot of people also rent their homes. So they don't even see property taxes. 

Second: US health care is mostly shitty and expensive, because it's wasteful. Not because it's not free. In Germany health care is simply much more efficient in that we get more health for much less money. That's not to say our health care isn't wasteful as well. But as the Pentagon taught us, there is not limit to being wasteful, even if you are not openly corrupt.

Third: As [Draeth](http://www.reddit.com/user/Draeth) pointed out, the [effective tax rate isn't all that much different](http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/z14na/please_help_me_understand_why_do_germans_like_to/c60uu0c), depending on how much you earn and what you spend it on. Apart from the wasteful health care system in the US, they have pretty awsome infrastructure (which is more expensive, since the country is bigger). 

Bottom line: There is no huge difference. It's just more transparent in the US. I seriously doubt ordinary Germans would be so relaxed and praise our health care (which isn't paid through taxes, btw.) if our taxes were as transparent as the US taxes were. I certainly know a couple Germans that do their own taxes and can't stop complaining about them and government waste.

1. In Germany, parties are much more important than individual candidates, and, as a consequence, the 2nd vote is considered more relevant. The first vote is seen as a technicality.

2. There is an additional complication never mentioned in introductory texts: The 2nd votes are counted on a per-state basis. Thus, the overall nation-wide result is skewed depending on how the states voted (and how many people showed up to vote). Therefore, it's almost impossible to calculate the precise number of seats from the total number of votes a party received.

Your number 4 is correct: 299 directly elected candidates as a result of the first vote, 1 candidate per constituency. This is straighforward, but we hardly care. I couldn't the candidate who won my constituency.

You are also right about the 2nd vote: ""I understand that you vote for a party, and that the parties receive seats depending on what percentage of the second vote they won. For example, Party A received 15% of the second vote, they receive 15% of the seats."" (with the additional complication 2) This means 15% of all the 598 seats.

Now, the problem is that 299 of the seats are already taken. Therefore, it may be impossible for party A to get 15% of the total number of seats (598).

First the 598 seats are distributed among the parties according to the second vote, then those are distributed among the Länder according to the second vote.

So if a party recieves more seats by first vote (direct candidates) than by second *in one Bundesland*, there will be a Überhangsmandat, even if on the national level the party recieves more seats by second vote than it wins by first votes.

It's possible that additional votes for a party in Land A will change the distribution of the party's seats among the Länder without being enough votes to give the party a new seat (rounding effects). In effect one of the party's seats from Land B will go to Land A. Now, if the party had a Überhangsmandate in Land A, it's possible that more votes for the party result in less seats.

1) The vote cast on the individual: advantage: being directly elected makes the representative loyal to the people. Disadvantage: causes the system to slant towards a two-party, or two-blocks system: only the two must popular candidates have a chance, which will be typically candidates from the biggest parties, because people are interested in parties and not in individual skills, so people vote for big-party candidates in order not to cast a vote that will be most likely lost. This is America, Britain, France. So small parties with 10% popularity hardly get any votes.

2) The vote cast on the party list: advantage: helps small parties. Disadvantage: the rep is loyal to the party elite, not to the voter. 

Probably Americans, Brits, French cannot really imagine the disadvantage in the second part. It is huge. If your party is popular, then if the elites put you say 10th or 20th on the list basically you are guaranteed a seat no matter what. In the essence it is not very democratic. You basically owe nothing to the voter and everything to the party elite, hence you become a nice passive voting machine for your party. Such reps in older times we called ""mameluks"" in Hungary - reps who never did a thing, just obediently voted for every bill their party proposed.

I think this is pretty much it. Most countries doing well have this kind of culture. I'd say the Americans and Brits also have it by the way, they just need a little propaganda to remind them why they should do this once in a while.  
  
Of course that, as a Portuguese, this idea is abhorring to me; which is probably the problem we have here. Sadly, you need a nation of robots to be a successful society nowadays.  
  
For instance, one time I was in Brussels waiting for the pedestrian signal to turn green to cross the road, with something like 20 Belgians waiting for it too. There were absolutely no cars in the road for as far as the eye can see, so I just crossed it. The Belgians looked at me in disbelief, and then a few brave souls did the same - running quite fast and smiling - like if they were rebelling or something.  
  
Belgians aren't even the most strict rule followers in Europe, so this probably only happened by chance, but I think it illustrates the different mentalities. A Portuguese only follows a rule if his common sense tells him to, while lots of other people in Europe just blindly follow them.

The essence of rule-following is that a modern economy requires a huge amount of division of labor and cooperation, which means people use in their decisions a huge number of assumptions regarding what others do, and when we break rules, even when it looks innocent, or even helpful, we still break the expectations of others and that throws a monkey wrench in the system. 

(I mean for example the most astonishing thing my friend heard when we worked in Germany is don't work harder than expected. He was wow, I thought it is good to exceed such expectations? The answer was no, because then you can be tired or break down sometime later when we are counting on you, so it is more important to be always fit and ready to work when we are counting on you than to be overly productive for a while. This way of thinking is very new for me.)

true,yeropinionman,UNSA,United States,"&gt; in Spain and Ireland the public sector should have actively cooled the economy by cutting down public investment

I think your diagnosis is completely correct: the way the Euro currency area is currently set up, the only way to avoid the current crises would have been for the likes of Spain and Ireland to try to tamp down their economic boom by undertaking massively contractionary fiscal policy to offset the inflow of investment from Germany and others.

But is this prescription realistic? Spain was, in fact, running a fiscal surplus in the run-up to the crisis; everyone at the time thought they were being responsible. If there is a ""next time,"" they will likely learn from this and they will lean even harder against the boom. But will they know exactly how hard to push back? Can a parliament react swiftly and responsibly enough to actively manage the macroeconomy? I don't think so--this is, after all, why the politically independent central bank run by technocrats was invented!


&gt; in case of system risks, like what we are happening, it is the state that is carrying the burden.

Tell that to the 25% of Spaniards who are unemployed.

&gt; You might ask shouldn't we have then a bigger army or ally with NATO, and to this I have to answer that security is balancing act ... deeper integration with the EU is less frightening because they don't see it as an potential aggressor

Overall this makes sense: more integration with others in Europe is a counterweight to Russian aggression. I'm just wondering about the marginal security benefit of joining the Euro currency zone once you're already part of other EU institutions. Is Sweden taking a reckless security risk by keeping an independent currency?

Jedem sollte klar sein, dass eine solche Aktion nichts anderes bewirkt, als allen hier in Deutschland lebenden Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund riesige Angst einzujagen und Sorgen vor rassistischen Übergriffen zu verstärken. Aber anscheinend kümmern sich diese Vandalen auch nicht darum was sie anderen Menschen zufügen, wenn es nur darum geht die eigene Meinung durchzusetzen. 

Eine Eiche ist zuallererst ein Baum und wer bei Eiche zuerst an ""Deutschtümelei"" denkt hat vermutlich psychologische Probleme. Zum einen ist der Ursprung der ""Friedenseiche"" wesentlich älter als das 3. Reich (schon auf der Wartburg zu finden und nach dem Deutsch-Französischen Krieg als Hoffnungszeichen für lange anhaltenden Frieden) und zum anderen ist die Kritik an Joachiim Gauck aus dem Zusammenhang gerissen und absolut hahnebüchen. Übrigens scheint die eiche auch der einzige Baum zu sein der zu dieser Jahreszeit noch pflanzbar ist und nicht furchtbar oder wie ein Weihnachtsbaum aussieht.

Ja, dass der momentane Ansatz der Aufarbeitung nicht genug ist ist richtig, aber ich hab denoch die starke Vermutung, dass der Vorschlag der Antifa - sofern existent - besser ist.

Dass die beiden Herren vom Freundeskreis Daraja e.V. nicht reinkamen ist meiner Meinung nach unentschuldbar, aber: man weiß bisher nicht an wem oder was es lag. Eventuell war es nur ein bescheuerter Türsteher, der auf eigene Faust handelte? Wiso sollten die Veranstalter die beiden einladen, wenn sie sie dann doch nicht reinlassen? 

Was mich aber an der ganzen Verteidigung der Antifamitglieder am meisten stört ist, dass man sich nichtmal bei den Opfern, also denen, die man mit dieser Aktion verletzt hat, entschuldigt. Nichtmal ein ""wir entschuldigen uns bei denen, die wir mit dieser Aktion erschreckt oder beleidigt haben"". NICHTS.

There's a few problems with that statement.

&gt; So bottom line is in Germany people get better health care, better education, better social safety, better public infrastructure, etc than in the US but they pay roughly the same?

Basically, yes. The infrastructure is more expensive in America, because suburbs turned out to be a huge waste and the country is bigger, hence infrastructure would also be more expensive if people in the US lived in more efficient layouts. Then you have the military, which gets a lot less money in Germany. Health care doesn't even factor in that much, because it is outside the tax system both in the US and in Germany.

&gt; That's a joke, right?

Just three examples: Most Americans do their income tax themselves, most Germans dont. Most Americans own their property (and pay property taxes), most Germans rent (and don't pay property taxes). If you buy anything in Germany, prices always include taxes. Taxes don't even show up in a grocery store at any point. In the US, you always have to pay sales tax extra. 

&gt; Direct democracy was very much opposed by the framers of the United States Constitution and some signatories of the Declaration of Independence

So what? You still get a ton of stuff to decide on every ballot. Germany has nothing. No direct democracy at all. Nada. You will always only elect candidates. If you get 50.000 signatures for a political initiative, it can be put to vote, but not on any ballot. People have to come into their townhall to vote outside regular voting season. And when they do get a majority, it is only a suggestion to the elected officials. 

Just because there is little direct democracy in the US, you can have less, or none, in other countries. Just because Germany has a very inefficient health care sector, that's not to say the US can't have it much, much worse.

This system is highly disputed, though, and the constitutional court ruled that it needs an overhaul which our current government fraction failed to do.

That's wrong. ""Ausgleichsmandate"" do not exist on the federal level, I think they exists in some Länder (states). What's controversial are the Überhangsmandate, for two reasons: 

(1) Together with other effects they produce the so-called Negativesstimmgewicht (the effect that more votes can result in less seats). The constitutional court found this effect to be unacceptable. Citizens have to know that, no matter how complicated the system, voting for a party will not hurt it.

(2) Überhangsmandate distort the representation of the parties in the Bundestag (compared to how much they should have according to the second vote). This, the court found acceptable for the time being.
