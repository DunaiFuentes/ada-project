true,krattr,null,null,"So, 420,000 Greeks started worshipping Hitler in 3 years' time (Golden Dawn's votes in 2009 were 20,000)? Let's see what led to this result. 

According to the recent election results, 80% of the voters chose parties that one way or another want a European solution to this crisis, and accept paying the amount of legally accumulated debt (half of them ask for a panel of distinguished international experts to examine the agreements since the restoration of democracy in 1974). But they also reject extreme austerity and ask for better conditions. The current program led to chaos.

The IMF projected recession at -7.5% from 2009 to 2012, but the real number is more than double of that now. Incomes dropped by a massive 25% in 2011. Minimum wage dropped by 22%. To add insult to injury, IMF's officials say that Greece's minimum wage (€590) is 4 times Bulgaria's minimum wage (€140), therefore if Greece is going to be ""competitive"", the minimum wage should be comparable with the one across the border. Reality check: to be above the poverty line in Greece, you should earn at least 4 times Bulgaria's minimum wage! While a monthly card for transport costs €45, with a Bulgarian minimum wage in Greece you couldn't eat, find a place to stay and pay bills with the remaining €3 per day. You couldn't rent half a closet, three floors below the ground.

Of course, there's the usual mythology of the populist media, where Greeks drive Porsche Cayennes (in reality only 1 is sold every 2 days, where Greece's population is approximately 11,000,000). Not to mention the usual suspect about statistics. In 2004, after 2 years in the Eurozone, the new Conservative government started recording expenditure for defence equipment upon payment of the deposit, instead of recording it upon delivery. Retroactively, this change had the effect of increasing government deficits prior to 2004. The result? The revised deficit figure went 0.07% higher than the established limit (3%). But accusations about this are hypocritic, because this is still lower than the equivalent revised deficits of other member states that joined the Eurozone at the same time. Putting it differently: France was above the limit and couldn't join the Eurozone.

Coming up next, the useless Dublin II regulation. Greece has a huge coastline. EU's external borders are Greece's borders. Greece isn't Germany or Slovakia, having it easy with neighours and... geography. Illegal immigrants leave Asia and Middle East, travel for up to 2 months, mostly in vans, pay up to €10,000 euros ($13,000), then cross the border with Turkey (not an EU member). Successive Turkish governments did little to tackle the problem; they signed agreements but accept only a small percentage of these immigrants back, because if they honoured their signatures, they would have to spend a part of their budget for taking care of them. Central European governments point the finger, but they hide their racist views behind regulations made to measure for them

This is the reality. EU did not act like a union. The austerity program didn't work. Now there are hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, mostly in deprived areas. These poor people, victims of a modern slave trade, go to the extremes: they steal and attack Greeks, even raping old people. Golden Dawn started protecting, even feeding pensioners and families living below the poverty line.

There you have it. Instead of fixing a broken program, Germany's government insists to cut low salaries and pensions, again. Stupidity reached an all-time high. Keep that in mind when we talk about shame.

Il y a plein d'interprétations possibles ; en vrac et sans jugement sur leur valeur logique :

- peu de discipline de vote chez les électeurs du FN qui n'ont pas suivi la consigne de voter blanc
- matérialisation de la justesse de la vision électorale de F. Mitterrand selon laquelle la montée du FN sert à faire perdre le parti de centre-droit
- défense de l'importance démocratique de l'abstention et du vote blanc
- argumentation de l'illégitimité de F. Hollande, élu avec les votes d'une minorité d'électeurs
- déception de ne pas avoir vu les abstentionnistes ou ceux ayant voté blanc se reporter sur la candidature de N. Sarkozy
- soulagement de voir acquise la victoire de F. Hollande alors que ça aurait pu facilement être l'inverse
- incompréhension qu'il y ait eu tant d'abstentionnistes incapables de comprendre la nécessité impérieuse de mettre fin au mandat de N. Sarkozy
- incompréhension qu'il y ait eu tant d'abstentionnistes incapables de comprendre la nécessité impérieuse d'écarter F. Hollande du pouvoir

Who said I was for independence? Seriously, if your only information about PR is coming from a quick glance at Wikipedia, stop.

Understand that in Puerto Rico, American means rich, blonde, arrogant foreigner fucking us over. People are for statehood to escape the colonial status, not because they feel American. If you have a counter-argument because you studied this before today, by all means. Otherwise, I'm sorry, but you're saying very ignorant things.

true,Oda_Krell,EURO,"German, living in the Netherlands","Nice question, OP. One thing though: the words that are the most telling about a culture might not necessarily be the ones that are the hardest to translate. That said, German here, let me try.

The obvious choice would be ""gemütlich"". Actually quite similar to the Dutch ""gezellig"". Maybe with a bit less focus on the social aspect and a bit more emphasis on the comfort level. Still, both are used similarly, as I can attest having lived in both places. But that choice would be 1) too obvious and 2) not all that telling about Germany and the nature of its people. I mean, everyone likes comfort, not only Germans, right?

So how about ""Sorge"" (a noun). A wordbook will probably tell you it can mean sorrow, concern, but it's a bit more complex than that. When used in a phrase like ""sich Sorgen machen"", you're saying you're worried about someone or something. In a compound like ""Alltagssorgen"" (everyday worries) it becomes fuzzier: a low-level worry about everyday live. ""Sorgenkind"" is, either literally or metaphorically a child that you're worried about, usually because it doesn't confirm to certain expectations. Now, look at the related verb ""sorgen"". ""Sich um jemand sorgen"" still means being worried about someone, but ""für jemand sorgen"" means *taking care* of someone. I'm not a lexicographer or etymologist, but I'm pretty sure that's no coincidence -- being worried about something and having to take care of something are obviously related things in real life. But it's part of the reason why you'll hear some variant of ""Sorge"" so often in German.

true,OurHolyRue,ROMA,Romania,"When you make a claim that's based off of someone else, you have to pinpoint the exact location of that: Author, work, edition, time, page, etc. That makes it easy to verify. When you have a documentary making the all-encompassing summary presentation (this is to a certain degree due to time constraints and format) where you usually just have author and -maybe- work, then that's poor referencing (plus, you could argue it would be awkward to fill the documentaries with detailed citations, but that doesn't detract from the latter point of poor referencing). Yes, you can e-mail the makers of the docu, and they may or may not have the info you require, if they respond. That's not adequate, for the same reason you wouldn't accept that kind of info being withhold from a book or article.

As for what you see in a documentary, well, that's fine, you can analyze that, but the bigger and more important question is: what *don't* you see in the docu? And that's also a big problem with docus, because seeing an interview with some witness is all fine and dandy, seeing footage, likewise, but what about what's not shown (maybe what can't be shown?). Remember the quote that can be taken out of context. Just to take a random example, let's say we have a video of a cop beating a woman, and that's when the footage starts, but prior to this the woman threw something at the cop with the intent of injuring. Now, if you see this footage you'd be appalled at the brutality of the policeman, but that would be a mistake because you are missing important parts from the story. Now imagine you add video editing and music aimed at exaggerating the emotions of the footage. It's a fine line between entertainment and rational inquiry. Or more simply put, what you see isn't everything there is.

tl;dr it's poor referencing because it doesn't cite sources for claims properly in the actual documentary; whether or not you might salvage the needed info by contacting the docu maker is debatable and arguably inadequate.

With the exception of Belarus (Glorious Socialist relic from the Soviet Union) all the governments are economically right wing and ethically centre. It doesn't matter if a ruling party calls itself social, socialist or even communist ([1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_of_Working_People), [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_Communists_of_the_Republic_of_Moldova)), they will always be social liberal at most, pro-capital at worst. When you're lucky, you'll get something friendly like Norway's Arbeiderpartiet or Ireland's Sinn Fèin (The old one). When you're unlucky, you get new Labour fucking you over, or PASOK.

The Ethical perspective is a bit more interesting. You might have heard of parties like Jobbim (The Hungarian fascists), recently Golden Dawn in Greece or the good old German NPD. When the governing parties fail, the resurgence of the far right is inevitable. Some would call them fascist, but I'm reluctant to. The label 'fascist' is in my opinion too much honour for parties that are essentially vulgar xenophobes and ultra-nationalists.

But these parties are mostly ignored. A bit more to the centre is the most vile of the bunch, the right wing populists. They're not racists they say, but they still want the immigrants out. They say there's too much crime, which might have something to do with immigrants. Implying immigrants have to do something with everything that goes wrong, that's the key to success right there. Examples: France's FN, Belgian's Vlaams Belang, Dutch' PVV.

And then there's the true radical socialist overthrowers but they don't get votes. Except in Greece, but not enough.

The most successful countries in my opinion would be the social liberal success-stories like Norway. What they do right is not betraying completely what they once stood for, and just being rich (oil helps). Also successful, like shenpen pointed out before me, are small shit countries like Switzerland, Monaco or Belgium who manage to use their peculiar position to create a safe haven for capital and thus screwing over other European countries, but they do profit from this themselves.

It seems to me that you and the original poster are confusing altruism with a ""sense of european unity"", or being part of a deeply integrated community.

Altruism is a form of charity, helping others without expecting them to help you, nor being involved in some way. I don't think it will ever exist in something as large and diverse as Europe.

What might happen one day is a reduction in nationalism. Instead of being a citizen of a country, you might become a citizen of the ""united states of europe"", much like the U.S. exists as a country with federal taxes, military, police, laws, some health services, and so on, instead of an union of independent states.

That said, is it really what people asking for ""altruism"" want? Becoming an unified country would also mean centralised government and control. There would be no countries helping each other out, it would be Brussels taxing all European citizens, and coming up with a budget and social programs for all people living here. Unlike the current case where there EU asks Greek government for financial reforms to get cash, *there would be no greek government*, only EU running things.

I'm not sure if this option is preferred to the current way of having independent countries.

true,askur,ICEL,Iceland,"OH MY GOD I AM SO SORRY FOR THIS WALL OF TEXT! But not sorry enough to delete it &lt;.&lt;

Culpability is key here, in the end. But that fact wont help with fixing Europe.

Being Icelandic I have a microcosmic view on this. A whole lot of families here decided to buy property and mortgage it to levels they could never have hoped to pay off with or without this little economic windfall. They are now mighty screwed, to the point where they will hit the streets or welfare. I'm talking 15%-20% of all families here.

I am not one of them. If Iceland is the EU, those families are Greece, Spain and Ireland and I get to play Germany. I have the choice of seeing these families on welfare, on the streets or paying out of my own savings to help them. I don't really want to pay out of my own savings, be it through added income taxes, equity taxes or what have you.

This leaves me with throwing them out on the street, or putting them on the dole. If I go with the latter I will still be paying for them. Not only will I be paying for them but so will everyone else around me and there are people in my family who are getting by but could not have added taxation put on them, and added taxation is required to increase welfare spending (or we print money and cause inflation which now puts the problem on the welfare beneficiaries as well). That option sounds self-defeating as it will put more families at risk which will end up with me having to pay even more as they go on the dole.

Now putting them onto the streets? In any sane situation I wouldn't feel sorry for these people. They made their own bed and should lie in it. But we're talking a hefty percentile here. That's a huge increase in street class crime. That's a huge decrease in the education level of Icelands future. That's a huge step towards a class based society. I don't want that at all.

So I have the only option of paying up. My savings, the ones I intended to use to buy a house, will not accrue as I intended. My purchasing power will plummet, my income taxes will skyrocket. My hidden taxes will be less hidden as my money evaporates into the system so we can help those families to cut their losses. They'll probably keep any equity they may or may not have created.. at least they'll own their house. I wont own a house or an apartment. Because I saved money. In an economy where nobody else did for a long time. I thought I was being smart, and I was. Everyone else was just being stupid and I let them. Furthermore, I didn't get out of dodge.

See, this culpability reaches me in the end. I, as a civilian, have a duty that goes beyond voting every four years. This is a fact of democracies, a fact we really do not want to concern ourselves with. It's too much work to be dutiful. But I and everybody else shirked our duties and here we are. And who am I to blame the stupid people who just went with the flow for that? Sure they are guilty of stupidity but they didn't cause the environment in which such stupidity was considered the norm. They didn't cause this ""crash"". They just get to suffer for it.

Where does culpability stop? I can admit that I was simply too blue-eyed and innocent to know I should have cared a whole lot more. But I'm a person, not a union. I still find this diatribe of mine very helpful when I get angry at Greece for making it easy for anti-membership people over here to rage over the monster EU.

Understandable, after all, how to spend the money you earn via taxes is one of the most important things government do. So unless the EU would effectively unite all members to become one nation, complete fiscual union is, literally, impossible.

If fiscal union means greater fiscal coopertion between EU members, and yielding *some* fiscal autonomy to EU organs, then that's possible.

Not only that, but they see how the new (and old) politicians in power are privatizing everything for their friends/family and rising their own salary, while at the same time are cynical enough to pray that ""we all have to tighten our belts in these hard times"".

Aside from that little rant, what I think is that people would be OK with paying higher taxes if they were proportional to their income, and if they felt that it was indeed contributing to society as a whole.

There is a better term. It's ""Puerto Rican"". Puerto Ricans are not Americans; they're Puerto Ricans. The same way Palestinians don't call themselves Israelis; and Taiwanese (at least some of them) don't call themselves Chinese. Citizenship and sovereignty are legal terms, and had no bearing on how this discussion ever came about. Americans are foreign to us, just like the French and the Germans are.

&gt; I'm insulting a lot of people. I get it. I might not be familiar with the intricacies of PR politics (I could not be, I don't live there), but unlike yourself, I am not letting emotions get the better of me.

Here's a solution: *stop* being insulting. I don't know why you are so incredibly hung up on the fact that you want to call me ""American"", but it's quite easy to stop. PR is one of the last colonies of the world (and the one, to my memory, with the most amount of people), and calling 4 million Hispanics that lived through the persecution of all left-wing and secessionists movements, forced English education in public schools to eradicate Spanish (that ultimately failed), and the complete legal destruction of all local businesses because of sheer proximity and power *Americans* is a slap in the face.

Puerto Ricans are highly nationalistic as a defensive mechanism to resist the most powerful state on Earth having us as a colony.

You say independence is a minority movement and you're completely right, but it wasn't always so. It's a minority movement for plenty of reasons (among those, incompetence in the party), but another reason was that any seccessionist was accused of being a Communist and either jailed or forced out of their job. My grandma has a huge ass file (we called them ""libretas"", or notebooks) of her being tracked by the government because she was a seccesionist. The independence movement was ruthlessly crushed decades ago, so by the time we were granted a modicum of power, there was no movement of which to speak of.

The two main parties now are the status-quo/sovereignty party, which wants more power short of independence (a reason for this is that Puerto Ricans were taught to be terrified of independence), and the statehood party (who don't consider themselves Americans; it is notable that not one Puerto Rican Governor of either party has ever had an English name).

I don't mean to sound emotional, angry or anything of the sort, but you are intentionally over-simplifying an incredibly complex situation. You can say we are ""American citizens"", but this doesn't mean we are ""Americans"".

&gt; This is irrelevant. They are, by virtue of the fact that Scotland is part of Britain, whether they like it or not. Just like Greenlanders will continue to be Danish citizens untill they secede. Whether they consider themselves Danish in the „national” sense is irelevant.

It is *very* relevant. The Republic Party was brought up to *me* as if it meant anything, to better explain some insane notion that Republicans are like Nazis.

This band is extremely anti-christian and has openly stated they are fascinated by anti-christian sentiment. They have songs with lyrics such as the following:

**The churches may decide what will happen to man in the other world
In this world, we the Black Metal order shall decide for our people

Mentally deficient, full of bluntness say:
""Blessed are the poor in spirit...""

Wouldn’t it be nice,
If they all went to their paradise
The one proclaimed by the fucking Christian Church
Into their paradise we’ll find ugly and mentally flat women

For over half a million years God was sitting
Watching men plucking one another’s eye
And only then had the brilliant idea
Of sending his bastard son, fucking Jesus Christ

But now the Devil prevails
This thing is balderdash

We shall let the church to rot as a gangrened hand
And slay upon their altars the idiots and the old scandal mongers
The healthiest part of the
Youth shall be with us

The plower with his scythe shall ripe the new harvest rightly
Burned, mutilated, millions of our ancestors
Under Christian psalms of love
We shall avenge... we thirst for blood!**

Le PS désire une continuité avec les politiques actuelles, et ne remet en cause les réformes sarkozystes qu'à la marge. Hollande s'est construit, tout comme une majorité des têtes du PS, dans une acceptation du paradigme de développement économique actuel.

Qu'il s'agisse d'un vote de rejet de Sarkozy, oui. D'ailleurs, sans cela, Hollande n'aurait pas gagné. C'est d'ailleurs ce qui est effrayant : après des années catastrophiques, Sarkozy ne se fait dégager que par un petit million de votants, et la différence est maigre avec le vote Hollande.

Par contre, je ne vois pas en quoi il s'agit d'une ""révolte"". Les Français viennent de choisir une voie comparable à celle de Sarkozy, mais avec une autre esthétique, une conception différente des modes de gouvernance en jeu, et une redistribution des richesses légèrement changée...
...mais bon, on est très, très, très loin d'un vote révolté, appelant à un changement radical. 

La révolte, c'était plutôt un tiers des votants au premier tour : Le Pen et Mélenchon (qui n'ont rien à voir, mais qui cristallisent les votes ""révoltés"" et une volonté de changement de paradigme). D'ailleurs, le report de voix FN-Sarkozy s'est moins fait qu'en 2007. C'est ce qui a fait perdre, en partie, Sarkozy. Ça aussi, ça fait peur. Il s'agit d'une ""vraie"" volonté de changer, sans compromis, pour une grande partie de ces votants. A l'opposée, le report Mélenchon-Hollande a été plus fort ; donc avec un électorat d'extrême-gauche qui a voté en rejet de Sarkozy ou en adhésion à un modèle plus ""light"" à ce niveau.

&gt; Why is Greece in trouble?

Greece has been living beyond its means since even before it joined the euro. After it adopted the euro, public spending soared and public sector wages practically doubled.

However, while money has flowed out of the government's coffers, its income has been hit by widespread tax evasion.

When the global financial downturn hit, Greece was ill-prepared to cope.

It was given 110bn euros of bailout loans in May 2010 to help it get through the crisis - and then in July 2011 it was earmarked to receive another 109bn euros.

But that still was not considered enough.

And so, in October 2011, the eurozone asked banks to agree to a 50% ""haircut"" on their Greek holdings, alongside an enhanced 130bn-euro bailout.

Since then, the economic situation in Greece has deteriorated further and the new deal involves an even bigger debt write-off than previously consented to by the banks.

personally, i would not put stalin on the left. he's authoritarian just as much as hitler. he wasn't only definitely anti-democracy (progressive people should be ""for the people"" and so should naturally levitate towards an open system... or more open than ""the boss said so"", anyway), but he actively punished people who disagreed with him. the fact that he happened to be the head of a ""socialist"" country is one of the big disgraces of the XX century, because it put a blindfold on many people's eyes, both on the right and on the left on who the man really was: a big knob. that has little to do with politics and *much* more to do with who he was.",0,1336418970,null,0,false,0,c4l7jbj,t3_tauz6,t1_c4l7jbj,t1_c4l5wmn,null,1428876057,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

We also have a word which in some contexts can substitute any word. That's the word ""такова/takova"", which can be best translated as ""what’s-its-name"".

We label communists left all the time, yet that ideology has produced some of the worst authoritarians of all time. The reason we still call the commies leftist is because they want a centralised control economy. The whole association of the left with social liberalism is coincidental to the economic aspects that is the core of any such ideology. As an example coming from the opposite end of the spectra you'd never call libertrarianism a left-wing ideology, because of its ultimate goal of a complete laissez-faire economy, but it's very much against authoritarianism and for social liberalism (much more so than most left-wing schools that share that trait, I might add), traits that you seemed to imply are decidedly left-wing in nature.

I would like to hear your opinion on two aspects though:

1 . Do you think it would be a good idea to abolish national budgets, parliaments and elections - and have a single european government who collects all taxes, and decides on all social programs across europe? Because I strongly believe that without this, there can be no substantial financial unification, nothing more than the current ""development funds"".

Just like in a single country, a city that's has good economy does not transfer funds to a city that's doing badly. Instead, these things are managed via a central government and budget that has final say about how both cities are run.

2 . Where is the greek altruism towards less well off countries in the EU? I'm from a country whose purchasing power per capita is 33% less than greece even after the crisis, greek minimum wage is above our *average* wage, and unemployment is higher. Others in Eastern Europe are doing far worse, up to 2x poorer than greece right now.

4: Wenn du mehr lerntest*, würdest du bessere Noten bekommen.

Die Bildung des Konjunktiv 2 für Verben orientiert sich am Präteritum. Dazu kommen die Endungen:

ich	~e
du	~est
er/sie/es	~e
wir	~en
ihr	~et
sie	~en

Diese Form der Bildung wird allerdings kaum in der Sprache genutzt. Meist umschreibt man mit Infinitiv+ ""würden"":

4: Wenn du mehr lernen würdest, würdest du bessere Noten bekommen.

Im Alltag **würdest** du eher diese Form gesprochen hören. **Hörtest** du jemanden so sprechen, **käme** es dir oft merkwürdig vor.

Du hast bei 7 und 8 ""sie"" groß geschrieben. Dies tut man nur in persönlicher Anrede. Hier ist es jeweils ein einfaches Personalpronomen. In 7 steht ""sie"" für Frau Maler, in 8 für Doris. Als Personalpronomen wird ""sie"" klein geschrieben.

While I feel Dutch culture has generally been moving away from this, and the word itself isn't untranslateable to different languages I still want to make a case for ""goedkoop"" (cheap).

Why? Because its etymology is obvious (for Dutch people) and very telling of the Dutch culture of a few decades ago.

""Goedkoop"" is a conjunction (don't know if this is the right word, sue me) of ""Goed"" (Good/Well) and ""Koop"" (a buy). The obvious connection between the etymology and meaning of the word is then that cheap products are always a ""good buy"". I think it might have something to do with our trader past (where buying cheap means making more money when selling later on), but this is only speculation.

In general I feel that Dutch culture has been moving more towards ""better value for money"" in the past decades, but this is debatable since it's highly dependent on my own buying patterns and personal observations.

However this must not be confused with the purpose of your own individual life. That one's entirely up to yourself to fill with purpose. And even though it may sound cheesy and esoteric to some that's the only thing that will do the trick of living a happy life.

Some people may find it a disheartening thought that there is no other 'real' purpose to their lives other than living and passing on their genes and they may turn to imagined higher purposes like religion or ideologies. Or they may think that the society they live in does not give them the respect they think they deserve ... that's, for example, where alienated young muslims raised in western societies and people like Anders Breivik are on the exact same page. Both tend to believe that by subscribing to a supposed higher cause they can elevate themselves above other individuals and give their life more 'meaning'. That's what perceived Anomie does to certain individuals.

I give purpose to my own individual life by trying to be helpful to others, make their lives better, cheer them up, make them laugh, give them a good time and educate them on the things that might be of importance to them. That's what makes my life better and satisfies me personally.

You may going about this way too abstract. Constructing a purpose to your individual life from the purpose of life in general is not going to make you happy. It might seem easier than getting a feeling for yourself, for what you feel, for what you want but it isn't.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"I didn't say that it is only hard work, it is hard work combined with efficient usage of resources and ability to change throe time. 

For example during the 60s and 70s in both Finland and Sweden ship building was a major industry, however in the 80s South Korean builders started to flood the global market with cheaper freight ships. The Swedish shipyards didn't admit that they were unable to compete with price, and invested heavily to automatize their product, and thus keep in the mass market. The Finnish shipyards admitted straight away that they had snowballs change in hell to compete with Koreans. Thus they made the decision to concentrate into passenger and cruise ships, a much smaller market, but a market that needed much more know-how than building ships in bulk. Both the Finnish and Swedish had the know-how, but only Finnish shipyards admitted it and changed with time. Today there are no Swedish shipyards, but Finland there is still shipbuilding industry, of course the industry doesn't have the same scale that it used to have, but it is better to change with times than to fight out and die.

Another example from the national level is the transformation of the Finnish economy to a knowledge based economy that largely happened in the 90s. In the beginning of 90s Finland had major depression which was a combination of collapse of exports to USSR, decline of exports to western markets due to high labour costs, collapse of the local housing bubble, etc... During the depression official unemployment grew to nearly 20% and many traditional industries and companies went bust. In that situation the state saw that we couldn't compete with low cost countries, the only option to maintain the standard of living would be build competitiveness on know-how. This lead to doubling of intake of collages and universities, funnelling money not only to public research programs, but also investing into research partnerships with private industries and companies. Of course there were few mistakes like investing lots of money into biotech, and currently there is discussion of is investing into startups and venture capital firms bringing enough results. Then again thanks to these programs there are many domestic and foreign high tech companies here, and many traditional industrial sectors have added high tech elements to their products and services.

I also must point out that flexibility in our society has increased dramatically in the last 20 years. In the 70s and 80s it was very hard and costly for firms to restructure and axe jobs. Today there are still rules that companies must follow, but it is much easier to fire people. And this is good, this is very good. Firms can change when they need, and people keep themselves more competitive as they know that there are no jobs for life. I for example in the last 3 years, in two different companies have been in 4 to 5 co-operative negotiations, in my current firm they just shredded 20% of the workforce in Finland. But it is all good, we have to concentrate on things that make money, and when the good times come again there will be a hiring boom, and the people will find new jobs as many foreign companies have just lately landed here to take advance of the available workforce.

Now to your question about other reason. In case of historic circumstances, industrialization started later in Finland than in other parts of Europe. The first industrial firms were mainly started up by foreign investors that manufactured simple things here benefiting from low cost labour. Actually Finland was still after the second world war mainly an agrarian society, the country came an industrial society in the 50s and 60s. In case of geographic position, we are more or less in the periphery up her and the weather is seriously bad. Of course Russia is our next door neighbour and there is some transit business, and Helsinki airport is developing to become a hub to fly into Asia due to its location.

true,thelittlebig,EURO,European Union,"It is a little more complicated than that, but let me try to break it down. 

The previous great coalition (between SPD and CDU, social democrats and conservative Democrats) had passed a law that is supposed to provide a spot in Kindergarden for every kid between the ages of 3 and 6. Kindergarden is not part of the official school system in Germany, but a voluntary thing. This was done in an effort to a.) give women the ability to rejoin the labor force earlier after giving birth, b.) give children from complicated backgrounds a stable environment at least for part of the day, c.) better prepare young children for the entry into the schoolsystem at the age of 6, d.) and very importantly boost the way to low rate of births/ woman.  
The government provides the money a spot in a Kindergarden would cost for those that don't have enough money to ensure equality.  
The Herdprämie, or so argues the CDU, would only make the system fair by giving the money the government saves by not providing a Kindergarden spot, to the parents in question. Sounds good right?  
This program would only help with point d.) of the previous idea though and would have a negative impact on the points a.), b.), c.). That is because especially families that are already in need of extra cashflow would take this opportunity to appropriate the funds not for raising the kids, but other needs. So that in this case especially the kids most in need of a stable environment or extra preperation for school would be taken out of the system. It of course also discourages women from rejoining the already depleted labor force.  
Therefore this initiative marginalizes women as a whole, but especially children growing up in low income families and those with an immigration background. Kindergardens aren't especially effective at teaching kids German, but they do what they can for those kids were both parents only speak very basic German. For example kids of refugees, like the little girl Blessing I had in the Kindergarden group I once worked in. Her mother was a refugee from Togo (I think) and spoke three languages (Her native tongue, French, English; in decreasing order of fluency).  
In Germany Kindergardens/ daycarecenters have a multitude of usually well taught employees that offer a range of services like Ergotherapy, Physiotherapy, language training and assist in communication with the local employment offices and other parts of administration.  
If children from challeging backgrounds are not enrolled in a Kindergarden the parents will be much less likely to get into contact with these services or learn about their existance.  

As you see I don't actually have to get into the topic of this law being bad or good for women and their status in society at all. It certainly is a BIG point, but my concern in this matter is primarily for the children.  

As a last point you have to ask yourself where the money is supposed to be coming from, this shit is expensive.

I couldn't touch on every point I wanted to make here, otherwise this would have gotten huge. I think this might suffice to show you how controversial this initiative is though.

- Qualunquismo: a political view that promotes political apathy. It comes from a short-lived political party from the '40s ""the movement  for the common man"" (l'uomo qualunque) (eg: ""all politicians sucks, vote for me"")  
- Cerchiobottismo: When a speaker doesn't take a clear position on a topic, or embraces two contrasting positions in order to avoid the discontent of his audience. the word comes from the phrase ""dare un colpo al cerchio e uno alla botte"" which describes the barrel making process and I'm not even trying to translate

French living in Barcelona for 7 years here. A lot have been said already. I can add about those districts: (when I say center, I mean Gotico/Raval/Born):

- Gotico, Raval: If you want to live right into the action
- Born: Also very lively but somehow a bit more quiet. Still dead centric.
- Gracia: further from the center, but a great nightlife, charming streets, more authentic than the touristy center, great option to meet the locals
- Eixample: this huge district has broad streets and averagely, a better housing quality than the old center (where many of the buildings have no heating, no lift, etc)
- Poble Nou: village atmosphere for a very catalan experience

Also Loquo.com is great for renting a room, idealista.com for renting a whole flat (check if they have muebles, furnitures :-) )

Most would translate it as an oath that knows no master, king, or god. It is the most incredible oath/promise one can take. It is intensely intertwined with the Albanian concept of ""burrë"" which means ""man"" or ""being a man"", but it is actually not bound to the gender as there can be [""burrnesha""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_sworn_virgins). While it may seem weird (and from a non-Albanian point of view it is), gender roles and stigma are not bound to the physical gender in traditional Albanian culture.

I have discussed Besa with linguists, philosophers, and others. Philosophically it is precisely the dialectical opposite of [Bloom](http://zinelibrary.info/files/newer%20Bloom%20II.pdf). I am referring here to an opposite in order to explain Besa because otherwise it is practically impossible to grasp.

Besa is a state of mind/being. When I discussed Besa with psychologists they tell me that it sounds like the state of mind psychopaths or ""true leaders"" are in, as in ""totally and completely *meaning what you say*"". It generally has the effect on others of putting them into a kind of social limbo. I mean limbo as in they don't know whether they are inferior or superior in relation to you and the group anymore, these relations become meaningless (very similar to war buddies).

This limbo can go so far that individuality (or better, the ""being an individual among others"") vanishes in relation to somebody else who is in Besa with you/ you in Besa with them. In extremes you are practically the same person. I think it is best explained via bits of self-reference towards [experience](http://taulantr.posterous.com/27879670).

Some things which might help people triangulate the deeper concept more intuitively:
[Watchmen - Rorschach's death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeFZXNDz7uA&amp;feature=related)

You're making this so black and white. A large majority of people are not against multiculturalism per se, but they are against the current one which is in place. Like everything, it isnt perfect so it should be held to criticism like anything else.

For many people, the multiculturalism proposed by the ""soft"" left has just been a codeword for more free trade globalization which has resulted in loss of local cultures and more ""Americanization"". This opinion is shared by millions in France and Europe of all ideologies. Other people dont like that some immigrants do not have the same ideals of democracy. For example in France and most of Europe you are allowed to satirize, yet many Muslims become seriously pissed if you say anythign about their prophet. Same with homosexuality and this applies to Christians just as much.

I actually had a pleasant experience doing mine. I made an appointment on the consulate website and got an appointment for 8:30am on a Thursday (Thursday is an important detail). Since I had heard so many horror stories about the line outside the Frankfurt consulate, I actually showed up at 7am praying I would make my appointment. There was a line, but it was for foreigners applying for VISAs. They actually have a US citizen line right next to it and I was the first one there. On that particular day, they had 2 windows open. One serving US citizens and the other for the foriegners. I got in, sat down, and my number was called within 5 minutes. I got in and out and back on the road well before my scheduled appointment.

The reason Thursday is important is because their mail goes out on Friday back to the states for the passports to be made. I put my e-mail address on my renewal application and got an e-mail 8 days later saying that my new passport was in Frankfurt ready to be picked up.

My tips after my experience:

1) Make an appointment on a Thursday.
2) I opted to pick mine up in person, so I got to keep my old one while I waited. If you want them to mail it to you, you have to leave your old one with them. You can purchase postage paid envelopes there at the consulate and they will mail both your old ""voided"" passport and your shiny new one as soon as it arrives.
3) Show up early for your appointment.
4) I've been told that if you are in the Munich area, that it is actually quite empty and that you may have an even better experience there.

&gt; Je pense que c'est généralement très con, mais parfois ces expressions correspondent à des tendances non traduites réellement en Français ( Geek par exemple, pas une tendance je sais, mais intraduisible ) et sont la volonté d'une minorité de journalistes et publicitaires.

Je ne connais pas du tout le monde de la mode mais je peux causer pour le monde de la technologie informatique et des *start-ups*.

L'utilisation d'un mot d'origine étrangère correspond d'abord, effectivement, à la reprise d'un concept qui s'est forgé dans cette langue. Et là on tombe sur deux cas :

* ce mot n'a pas de bonne correspondance en Français, en particulier aucune qui n'ait été enrichi de tous les éléments de contexte qui se sont portés sur le mot étranger. Ce mot correspond en fait à un nouveau besoin et la langue Française s'enrichit autant de reprendre le mot étranger que l'Anglais (puisqu'il s'agit généralement de lui) s'appauvrit en alourdissant un mot courant d'une signification supplémentaire et donc des confusions possibles. C'est le cas par exemple pour moi du *mail*, qui correspond à un nouveau concept (""courrier éléctronique"" est pauvre et lourd). 

* Il existe un mot parfaitement adapté dans notre langue, parfois utilisé dans le même sens depuis longtemps. L'usage du mot étranger dénote alors en général, en même temps qu'une tentative d'appropriation des reflets perçus comme favorables d'un contexte exotique flatteur, une connaissance seulement superficielle du domaine, souvent technique, d'utilisation et une absence de réelle intégration intellectuelle du concept. J'ai beaucoup vu ça parmi les commerciaux des start-ups, ou bien les financiers draguant autour, ces gens là essayant de vendre des objets mal maitrisés à coups de mots servant de références culturelles mais rendant extrmêmement flou et ambigû le discours. Lorsqu'un concept devient important, il est nécessaire d'utiliser les bons mots, et si on a bien compris le concept et que l'on connait le domaine, alors en principe le doublon qu'introduit le mot Anglais lorsqu'un mot équivalent existe en Français apparaît évident. Et l'usage du mot Anglais est alors agaçant et dégrade le discours technique (on remplace un mot porteur d'un sens précis par une référence culturelle vague).",0,1336460022,null,0,false,0,c4lg5gn,t3_tc6bx,t1_c4lg5gn,t1_c4ld56l,null,1428880176,7,false,france,t5_2qhjz,7

Modernism has implanted the ideas of more freedom and more equality in the population, capitalism delivers the contradictions and crises wherein these ideas can flourish.

In recent years Europe made a shift from leftist to right wing governments [(link)](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/map-europes-shift-from-leftist-to-right-wing-governments/article2242058/). And the once social democratic parties turned liberal as well. The old Christian democratic parties either dropped their Third Way views in favour of liberalism our were dropped from the equation. What's left is a European Union ruled by neoliberalism, making a crisis more inevitable, more harsh, and unable to fix it, resorting to outdated tactics like austerity, privatization and lowering taxes.

The only alternative now exists at the extremes of the political spectrum. The right wing, especially the far right, has always been very critical and anti capitalist proposing radical third way policies rooted in corporatism. The Far left needs no introduction. But you have to realize that what was once considered radical is now the norm. Societies will always change when their current way of life has become unsupportable. 

Now, a small or somewhat large right wing opposition can influence policy, but almost never economic policy. The government might try to contain the immigration problem and crime problem because they don't want the Right Wing to take over. Economic change within liberal governments is mostly a result of pressure by unions and other labour pressure groups. They're a force to be reckoned with on their own.

I lifted this from IMF’s homepage.  
 
“In putting together the program for Iceland, we at the IMF had to reach for policy tools that were not part of our mainstream toolkit”.  

The program had four important elements.  

•	First, a team of lawyers was put to work to ensure that losses in the banks were not absorbed by the public sector. In the end, the public sector did of course have to step in and ensure the new banks had adequate capital, but it was insulated from vast private sector losses. This was a major achievement.  

•	Second, the initial focus of the program was exclusively on stabilizing the exchange rate. Here, we reached for unconventional measures, notably capital controls.  

•	Third, automatic stabilizers were allowed to operate in full during the first year of the program—effectively delaying fiscal adjustment. This helped support the economy at a time of severe strain.  

•	Fourth, conditionality was streamlined and focused on the key issue at hand—rebuilding the financial sector. While there are some issues in the broader economy where reforms will eventually be needed, these were not a part of the program.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"So, suppose the government of Greece says something to the effect of ""we can't take this austerity any more like this, things must change"". Okay, here's what can happen next:

1. Creditors give in: They give Greece a more relaxed schedule to implement reforms and pay back debt. Greece is now better off, however this sets a precedent and other countries soon want better terms for reforms and bailout repayments: Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, even some core countries may benefit from some looser conditions (Belgium, France, Netherlands). It is unknown how this lack of diligence or the smaller/late repayments will affect the economies of Europe and the markets. 

2. Creditors stand their ground: Now, Greece has two possible moves:

* Unilaterally deviate from the bailout conditions: Declares default, says it won't pay on schedule or won't pay at all. Possibly withdraws from the euro and unilaterally re-denominates its debt in the new local currency. This is unprecedented, in the sense that Greece owes most of its money to the EU countries and the IMF. No country that I know of has ever made such a strong move against so powerful creditors. Even in the case Argentina, they paid their debts to the IMF in full while mostly pushing the private sector around. It's the creditors' move. 

  * Let Greece go. This will set a precedent that will break the taboo that sovereign-to-sovereign debt is always paid back, one way or another. Other countries may try the same. Greece gets locked out of lending markets but can probably make it somehow.

  * Punish Greece and force them to pay. Three main options here, they are the threat or enactment of: a. economic war (embargos, trade fines etc), b. orchestrate a coup to install a government more willing to cooperate with their demands, and finally c. open warfare. Obviously all these options are considered icky in the current political climate of love and peace within the EU but who knows what will happen. 

* Stand down: Depending on how the Greek populace takes the ultimatum, the programme may continue more or less normally or Greece may go into a period of political turmoil. In the latter case, it is unknown what happens with the debt and the relationship with the creditors/EU, possibly we go back to step one.",0,1336470145,null,0,true,0,c4lh5az,t3_tbuwb,t1_c4lh5az,t3_tbuwb,null,1428880645,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Non è tanto un discorso di numeri (Fli e Api hanno i numeri da prefisso del telefono che ci si aspettava, l'Udc ha sostanzialmente tenuto la propria media), quanto di peso politico: Casini puntava tutto sul valore aggiunto che l'essere il Fede di Monti doveva portargli e contava di lucrare consenso sulla responsabilità e sul senso dello Stato.

In realtà il Pd ha vinto coi voti e i candidati degli altri. Ossia di quelli (Vendola e Di Pietro) che bestemmiano Monti a tutto volume.

The source of the problem isn't that men doesn't want women do be in charge, but that women that present themselves aren't better than other men (don't kick me now, let me finish this;) ). 
The fact is, that there isn't enough women studying politics (and it isn't men's fault. Women aren't as interested in politcs as men (My sister was really investigated for Nicolas Sarkozy for example, and she was really well know by the high up, not because she was good, but because she was one of the only women.))

So if Nicolas Sarkozy choosed more men in his minister throughout his mandate it's because he needed better minister with the crisis coming. And it's not because men are better in politics than women by definition, or because Nicolas Sarkozy is anti-feminism, it's just that if you have 10 women wich do politics, and 20 men who do politic, you have statistically more chance to have good men in politics than women!

What François Hollande is doing is stupid by definition, he will put less good minister in power, just for ...equality? He should maybe put more good ministers (men or women, just take the best!) in charge, so that they can work on to help women equality rights where it does really count: in the population.

But the idea of a minister of women I do approve, that's might be a good idea! There is still too much violence done to women nowaday.

true,MeteorPhoenix,PUER,Puerto Rico,"&gt; Maybe you should inform the one who brought up the Republican party.

I'm informing you, since you agreed with that train of thought.

&gt; What happened is that somebody mentioned the GOP, you asked why, and I gave a suggestion that it might be because you are Puertorican, and by extension, an American citizen (not realizing that ). That is when you started getting all offended and saying that you are not „culturally American” as if culture was the thing being discussed.

&gt; It's not my problem that you can't get passed your emotions and realize that American is a polysemic word, and that some meanings apply to Puertoricans, whether they like it or not. You are Americans geographycally, and (untill independence) Americans politically. You are not Americans culturally or nationally, and I have never argued this.

Equivocation again. What we are geographically is meaningless, and (in regards to the analogy to were explaining), what we are legally is meaningless.

*Politically*, we don't have a Republican Party, so *politically* using the Republican Party as an example is stupid. Do we both understand this?

&gt; And since you've discovered logic, I'm sorry to inform you that I have not been using equivocation, as I have been talking about „American” as citizenship (point b. from above) since day one. There is no equivocation here. On the other hand, you've been bringing up being offended as if that's an argument. It's an appeal to consequences, and that's why I've been ignoring it.

Bullshit. This is what you said:

&gt; He was making an analogy that is easily understandable for an American.

You are being incredibly disingenuous to change your point from ""American"" to ""American citizen"", because the only way your comment makes sense is if I was American in the sense that having something compared to the GOP would be easier to relate to for me, and the only way that would apply would be if I was a, as you call it, an ""ethnic American"".

You didn't mean someone ""of the Americas"", you didn't mean a Native American, and you didn't mean just an American citizen (meaning that the analogy would also be ridiculous to someone from the USVI). You meant what *everybody* understands when the word ""American"" is said without any sort of modifier to it. Next time, when you use a word that has a universal meaning and others rarely used ones (which I don't think is what happened; I simply think you were utterly ignorant about Puerto Rico before today and are now trying to save face), use the full term if you want to avoid misunderstandings. 

Say, if a Tibetan is talking, and you want to call him ""Chinese"" when you actually mean ""Chinese citizen"", I recommend you call him ""Chinese citizen"" if you don't want to be horribly offensive.

Oh, and as an fyi, I am not using the ""appeal to consequences"". I am not arguing that since I'm offended, I'm not an American citizen. I am arguing that you are an offensive, ethnocentric, ignorant person because, instead of quickly retracting your statement after I pointed out the cultural implications, you went to Wikipedia and pulled out referendum results without understanding *anything* of what those results mean, nor the background behind them.

It is ok to not know about some minor piece of land an ocean away from you. It is not ok to pretend you are not ignorant about it and attempt to make absolutely retarded statements and assumptions (such as we wanting to be part of the US based on them without understanding the 100+ year background behind those results) and thinking I'm pro-independence (I'm not).

This is a tip that will get you through life: being offensive is not about whether you think you're actually being offensive or not; it's about if the other person feels offended or not. All the power is in that person. If *I* say I'm offended, you stop the behaviour. You know why? Because you don't live here, and you have no idea why we would react in a certain manner to certain things. You are not that person, and therefore you can't determine whether something would offend that person or not.

Yes. Exactly. Authoritarianism is coincidental to right and left. ;)

The labelling of fascism and nazism as right-wing ideologies is one of the main exceptions to the whole economic thing.

I suppose we started calling them right simply because they were so staunchly against communism and socialism but willing to work with conservatives (but they also hated liberalism, so there's that).

I meant politically in the sense that PR is part or the US, not that it has the same political system.

&gt;after I pointed out the cultural implications

Which were offtopic since I asked a non-cultural question. Read the conversation again.

&gt;Oh, and as an fyi, I am not using the ""appeal to consequences"". I am not arguing that since I'm offended, I'm not an American citizen.

You are. You're arguing that since you and most puertoricans are offended, the word „American” does not apply to you guys, under any circumstance. Which is false.

&gt;you didn't mean just an American citizen

Says the omniscient redditor...

Also, I never said you yourself were for independence, btw. Please, read the thread again.

PS. Next time somebody says something you do not like, take the time to calmly explain what you don't like and take the effort to see where the other one is coming from before you put on your arrogant tone and start calling people ignorant. Calling the other person ethnocentric(?) just because you can't handle words is quite lame, and might work in real life, but nobody on the internet cares what you are offended about.

If anybody is interested in some real-world explanations for the things he said concerning the Greek elections (which even the foreign news correspondents got wrong).

1. The real far left (KKE, the Greek Communist Party) got only 8% of the vote. That's what they always get. They failed miserably to increase their percentage under *very* favorable circumstances. Perhaps because they still live in 1912. That's OK with them, because they don't actually want to put themselves in danger of ever having to govern.

2. SYRIZA, arguably the big winner of these elections is NOT the far left. They're merely... left. If that. The KKE won't even speak to them (the KKE won't speak to anybody). I can't tell how 'left' they would look to an American though. They look pretty 'center-left' from a Greek's perspective.

3. The Golden Dawn are really as bad as they look, or even worse. They are true Nazis, salutes, swastika and all. They're mostly violent thugs. Their true representation is less than 1%. They managed to take advantage of a very bad situation by misrepresenting themselves to the general populace (i.e. offering free food to the hungry, promising that they will get rid of illegal immigrants, etc). A large part of the votes that went to their favor were simply meant as a joke, or as a way to 'get some punches thrown inside the Parliament'. Such is the anger against our politicians. They have already shown their true colors by shouting 'ALL RISE' in their first press conference and then dragging journalists that refused to comply by their shirts and making them stand by force.

What you have to know is that Greece has three types of creditors: private creditors who already made debt swap/restructuring deal; public creditors who are the other EU states who have loaned money via IMF and EU institutions; and the ECB that has been buying Greek debt from the markets since the start of the crisis.

Negotiating a debt deal with private and public creditors is more or less impossible. With private creditors it will cause collateral damage around the world and will make sure that Greece won't be getting any new loans from the markets in the next several decades. With public creditors the situation is even harder as other member states have loaned money from the markets to loan it to Greece, if Greece would renege from this debt, there would be unprecedented anti-Greece sentiment in Europe.

The only creditor that can negotiate with the Greeks is the ECB.  ECB has bought Greek bonds in discount from the markets, some estimates put this to around 30% discount. What the ECB could do is to transfer this discount to Greeks via new debt swap deal. However the problem with this is that it is more or less the last leniency that the EU can afford to give, after that the Greek state has to be able to take care of the debt that is has accumulated, and that means continuation of austerity measures and restructuring of the state expenditures.

I myself strongly believe that in the coming months we will see a deal with the new Greek government and the ECB on transferring the discount of the Greek state.

This is exactly how many Greeks feel about the situation, and understandably so. If you listen to the rhetoric used in Germany, it sounds very much like the lazy and irresponsible Greeks must be punished. And the Greek economy is very close to breaking down.

&gt; The Austerity measures are designed to be something to help the Greek economy

It has been known for seventy years that austerity in a slump doesn't work. It is just unfortunate that the European leaders conveniently have chosen to forget it. The results is what anyone with the most basic knowledge of economy should have predicted: the more they try to save, the greater the depth becomes in relationship to the GDP. 

&gt; What we make the Greeks do at the moment is what we did to ourselves post-2000

You could do it because the economy in  peripheral Eurozone countries where expanding (granted with borrowed money), which meant that the real wages in those countries increased, and as a consequence the real wages in Germany decreased. And it created a huge market for German goods. 

So why not return the favor? Let European central bank allow for a higher inflation to make it easier for real wages in Greeks to go down. Let Germans increase their consumption so that someone can buy Greeks goods (ok, you just have to start to really like Feta cheese). Or should *everyone* run a trade surplus? You don't need basic economics to understand why that doesn't work.

The point is that the reason that the German strategy worked is that Germany existed in an environment where other states consumed and borrowed too much. It impossible to repeat that feat in the current economy, where everyone in Europe have decided that they need austerity and the central bank keeps the inflation low. The current plan would have a small chance for Greek if Greek where the only state that tried to save money. That isn't the case. In other words, your strategy doesn't work in the current climate.

true,Ferimoa,DENK,Denmark,"It's more that we have a lot of systems in place that work very well already, and a general consensus on many issues that are hot-button topics in other countries. 

For example, recently we've become relatively famous for two things: a very good stable housing market system that was implemented in the late 1700s and has never suffered a housing market crash like the US, Spain, Japan and so many others have - George Soros wants it implemented in the rest of Europe - and the 'flexicurity' labor model where strong unemployment insurance allows companies to be able to easily fire workers, without those workers having to endure a big loss in pay while they're searching for work. Those two systems may sometimes need a bit of tuning, but they work, both sides of the political spectrum agree they work, the rest of the world is jealous, and so it's not a political issue.

There isn't really a 'green' party either, because all parties agree that the environment is important. The nationalist Danish People's Party supported the right-leaning coalition government from 2001-2011 and got many very tight immigration controls implemented, but they also managed to change the opinions of most Danes too (they were extremely savvy politically and not a bunch of racist loons like so many other far-right European parties) so now, even though the left is in power, they won't revert the rules in place now, even though they opposed them when in opposition.

Another issue with the labor market is the very solid relationship between the employer and employee organisations that hammer out wage rises and worker conditions basically without government interference. Strikes aren't targeted the government, but are just bargaining tools in the yearly discussions, and so aren't nearly as political. DK has no lawgiven minimum wage, but the agreed upon minimum wage is much higher than most other places.

In the 70's, the government was left, and accumulated a massive debt that coupled with the oil shocks left DK on the ropes. Then a conservative led government in the 80's tightened up the finances, but there was massive unemployment problems. In the 90's, the left took over, but was more business friendly than they used to be (like Blair/Clinton) and got the economy going and employment down. Then the right took over in 2001 (liberal led, and now the conservatives are polling at under 4% btw) and got us tied firmly to the US with Afghanistan and Iraq and dealt with too lenient immigration policies. Over this time, the 'workers' have become middle class, the 'conservative elite' types are in retirement homes, people like tight immigration control but relations between Muslims and Danes in DK is actually pretty good because the issues that cause tensions (ghettos etc) are dealt with quite well, we went fully into the Afghanistan and Iraq wars in the toughest fighting and the population was generally pretty supportive (not enthusiastically, but our soldiers did a good job without too much controversy, and support for the war was over 50% even after US popular had begun to dip below that).

Ah, the old argument again, [Hayek vs. Keynes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nERTFo-Sk). I claim that Keynes does not work simply because we no longer live in nation-state economies, our system is too complex. On the other hand, you cannot keep spending when money runs out. Which one of the theories is correct never has been determined, both of them got the faux Nobel prize.

&gt; And it created a huge market for German goods.

Yeah, because it made every Greek buy a submarine from us, the richer ones two or three. Stop making things up, and stop repeating propaganda. We got our economy in order because we had innovated and because we tried to keep our money together instead of waging a quasi war against the Turkish.

&gt; So why not return the favor? Let European central bank allow for a higher inflation to make it easier for real wages in Greeks to go down.

May I point out that Germany has quite enough experience with unsubstainable inflation, thank you very much? Actually, we would rather get out of the Euro project than accept an inflation &gt;5%.

&gt; Let Germans increase their consumption so that someone can buy Greeks goods (ok, you just have to start to really like Feta cheese)

The Feta I got in my fridge is from the Netherlands.

&gt;  It impossible to repeat that feat in the current economy, where everyone in Europe have decided that they need austerity and the central bank keeps the inflation low.

We are not trying to save our economy - we are trying not to pay for other people's debts. Imagine you get to your pub every night, and every night you claim you will pay the day after.

&gt; Versailles was about humiliation and destroying our economy. The Austerity package is about enabling the greek economy. Two very different things.

Every single indicator shows the opposite. Even Merkel's advisors now think that the program was [wrong from the beginning](http://factdrop.blogspot.com/2012/02/peter-bofinger-imfsecbs-austerity.html):

&gt; Peter Bofinger, the prominent economic adviser to the German government, in a interview to the ""Frankfurter Rundschau"" newspaper sharply criticized the IMF-ECB austerity program that was implemented to debt ridden Greece, stating that ""The continuing plight of the Greek economy is a result of the austerity measures dictated by the troika"", adding: ""With the cuts, the economy has stalled, so the deficits rose, after which the troika demanded even harsher austerity measures."" In this vicious cycle the system collapses. ""The troika has violated basic laws of economic gravity.""

&gt; SPIEGEL ONLINE: The European Commission has prescribed a strict program of austerity measure for Greece. The government in Athens needs to cut its budget deficit by 75 percent by 2012, and EU aid is not planned. But it is unclear whether Greece will be able to steer its way out of trouble on its own. Is Brussels risking a state bankruptcy?

&gt; Peter Bofinger: To the contrary. The tough stance against Greece is the only correct approach.

The austerity program failed because it was harsh and ill-designed. The vast majority of the economists accept it, all indicators support it, it won't hurt to admit it.

Well, here in Europe many countries are already double-dipping into recession - notably including countries that have steered an austerity course in economic policy. The U.S., on the other hand, which opted for a proportionally larger stimulus than any EU country, is not double-dipping yet.

The time to save is not in the slump! Of course Greek should have saved money when their economy was good, but now is not the time to do it, because it is killing their economy.

It's just racist bullshit, and it is a big reason why it is very hard to find any productive agreements. (I hear unfortunately a lot of the same arguments in Sweden.)

For example, here in Hungary the state does approach the issue exactly as you suggest: both the red star and hammer and sickle and the swastika are prohibited as ""totalitarian"" symbols. Which is very understandable, when you look at the terror the communists sowed here under Rakosi and directly after '56.

In Holland, on the other hand, where I'm originally from, a communist party remained in parliament til the late 80s, and up til the late 70s it was unreformed Leninist - and nobody tried to ban it. For a long time it was ignored in parliament and vilified in the media,  sure - especially in the fifties. But eventually it became an accepted fixture of politics and now one of the rooms in parliament is even named after the communist party leader of the seventies. But then communism here has different connotations. We obviously never had a communist dictatorship or occupation. What we did have was German Nazi occupation, and the one group which most heroically resisted this occupation and fought in the underground was the communist party. They were heroes, then.

So that kind of thing makes it complicated. In many other European countries the communists were heroes in the anti-Nazi resistance. In many West-European countries the communists played a major role in labour movements and the legislation of basic worker rights. Some of these communist parties distanced themselves from the Soviet Union's totalitarianism long before the Soviet state's collapse: the Italian communist party shaped a ""Euro-communist"" ideology back in the 60s already, and were followed by other communist parties. 

So it's complicated. I personally wouldn't be caught dead wearing a red star here in Budapest, and I think that young clueless French or Spanish tourists who walk around here in red-star t-shirts are just rude. To some extent, I agree that there is a double-standard: Soviet paraphernalia are considered cute hipster accoutrements - can you imagine the same with swastikas? But what makes it complicated is that the swastika has, in the West, only ever been associated with ruthless terror, and nothing else. The red star or hammer and sickle have been tied to a broad swath of European history, from totalitarian mayhem to labour legislation within West-European democracies to anti-fascist resistance in the war.

Relevant to this point is that the Hungarian ban on the red star has actually ran into trouble in Strasburg at the European Court of Human Rights. The Court has now already twice or thrice ruled that the ban is in contravention with European law, and the court's reasoning used the exact above argument: the red star is a symbol of many things, not only totalitarianism. Unless you're Hindu, the swastika is pretty much only tied to totalitarian terror, and nothing good.",0,1336499280,null,0,true,0,c4llqtl,t3_tcpvx,t1_c4llqtl,t1_c4ll7wz,null,1428882877,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

So what happens when you combine desperate europian country's with a variety of cultures and languages, a made up curruncy, a global financial meltdown and a social safety net that offers workers 30 weeks paid vacation, full pension at age 26 and cradle to grave chocolate? ..... Go to the footage:

(video of riots. People throwing molotovs at the police etc.)

(shocked face Jon Stewart)  
Let's go Europe!

Either the fault line between Europe's ruling class and it's citizens just cracked open. Or Manchester United has drawn with Barcelona.

(background change to a picture of the globe titled International house of Pander-cakes)  
Yes austerity has proven to be quite unpopular to the newly 'austier'. It's effects now begin being felt electorally.

(Video of election footage: Voiceover:
In Greece the central parties, the center right and the socialist party, who backed the international bailout together only received a third of the votes in parliamentary elections. Voters rejected them both in favor of more extreme parties left and right.)

(john again, same background image)  
Aaah. Interesting choice.  
Rather than choosing a single path, Greece has gone with the bi-polar approach. 

(Video and voice of political journalist: 
The left-wing has a very radical program and probably holds the swing votes in the parliament now. Euh jeah, it's basically a old hard line communist party.)  
(Different journalist:  
In Greece, for the election over the weekend we actually saw 20 neo-nazi candidates that came into power. That's the first time that has happened since 1947. 

(Camera back at John. Background image of the map of Greece.)   
Greece... Elected... old line communist... and Neo-nazis.... to rule at the same time.

(italian accent)  
Hey, you know what might get us out of us chaotic political situation? ... What if we took 2 failed but opposing ideologies? You know, the ones that battled in WW2, And hired them?

(normal voice)  
It's like you're taking a peanut butter cup but instead of chocolate and peanut butter you use s*** and poison (background image changes to this). 

(Back to the globe/pander-cakes background)  
Still we know this are neo-nazis. They might be different from the nazi classic. Less hate, maybe a young, fresh play the kids can dance to? Let's hear there platform: 

(audio fragment of Golden Dawn political party spokesman)  
""we will seal our borders with mines...""

(John again)  
Alright!! **** that. Seal your borders with mines!!!! I guess that explains Greece new tourism motto:

(Picture of isolated house on a mountain:)  
GREECE: You'll be fine if you stay in the middle part

(back to John)  
But Greece was just one of 2 countries that was holding a election this weekend. The other France, where President Nicholas Sarkazy scored of against Francais Hollande. French voters given the choice of a denominative middle aged established bureaucrat with a implausible hot wife. Or a denominative middle aged socialist bureaucrat with a implausible hot girlfriend. 

Where's my list of things i don't understand of France?

Here it is: Why do al your elderly, middle aged bureaucrats have really hot spouse/girlfriends?

It's on my list along with: why are all your skunks so date rapey (picture of the cartoon skunk witch name i have forgotten).

Why when you buy baguettes you only get half a bag to put it in? I mean bag is in the name... (picture of 3 baguettes)

Why do you put your most hunchbacked people in charge of ringing your heaviest bells? (Picture of the huncheback of Notredamn)

Do you really think your kids should be drinking wine? (Picture of a child filling a wine glass)

Why do you have so much trouble walking against the wind? (picture of a mime artist and a umbrella) How windy does it get there?

Jerard Depardie (or something like it. Never heard of him)

Anyway the winner of the election Hollande, he promised to end the sharp cutbacks initiated by Sarkozy. So it's an exiting moment in Europian history. The very stuff of democracy. Both Greece and France sending a clear course correcting austerity measures that have been negotiated by the former Greek and French leaders in order of a EU stability act will not be acceptable to the people of these countries and will not stand!

(Video of German Chanselor Merkel. Voice over:  
German Chanselor Angela Merkel has already started firing off warning shots. We in Germany are of the opinion, and that includes myself personally, that the stability pact cannot be re-negotiated. 

(John again)  
Germany.

I forgot that Europe most powerful economy holds the most of the currency and in some ways there power can nullify the effect of other countries election. That's right: nearly 70 years after WW2 Germany controls all of Europe. 

The irony.

They don't have an army. Who would have thought that the key to German world domination would wind up being a international banking conspiracy? 

They need us.

En échange de quoi le PS cédera sans doute certaines circonscriptions aisèment gagnables car fortement de gauche à ses alliés en ne leurs présentant pas de concurrents.      

Bref, tout comme l'UMP l'a fait en 2007 avec son allié le Nouveau Centre, permettant à ce tout petit parti dépourvu de base d'obtenir suffisament de sièges pour former son propre groupe à l'assemblée, même si par ailleurs totalement inféodé à l'UMP.      
Donc, l'union. Ou à tout le moins, l'entraide à gauche. Tandis qu'a droite, le FN est dans une logique totalement opposée. Le but affiché est l'éclatement de l'UMP et le phagocytage de son aile droite afin, comme l'a annoncée MLP le soir du premier tour, de devenir la principale force d'opposition.       

Déjà, un mois avant les élections, on a pu voir le FN mettre en place une ""liste noire"" de tête de liste UMP - des personnalitées particulièrement importantes au sommet du parti - dont le but affiché est d'empecher l'élection, quitte à saborder le camp de la droite et donner la victoire à la gauche, la vision étant là à long terme. Et bien entendu MLP et ses partisans les plus connus se présenteront dans les fiefs du FN où les scores ont été particulièrements hauts (je me demande d'ailleurs qui ira dans le Gard).     
Donc, a mon avis, une victoire assez large du PS, deux petits groupes extrème gauche et verts, sans doute un seul député Modem, un groupe UMP pas mal réduit, et pour une fois - bonne ou mauvaise chose ? - quelques députés FN, voire un groupe.     


Le vrai suspense et les vrais enjeux, c'est plutôt de savoir de quelle ampleur sera la victoire de la gauche. Y aura t-il une majorité pouvant se passer au besoin du soutien du FDG et des verts ? Dans ce cas vu l'idée d'ouverture affichée par FH ils seront sans doute quand même au gouvernements dans quelques maroquins, mais FH aura les mains libres sur tout les sujets.       
Et puis bien sur se pose la question de savoir si MLP gagnera son pari : supplanter l'UMP ou a tout le moins se rendre suffisament incontournable pour le forcer à l'avenir à une alliance. Mais franchement ça je n'y crois pas.

As for the rest, it was for Portugal and Ireland, and we all saw what happened to them: they went to Brussels. Besides, as a follower of Keynesian economics, he contradicted himself on the appropriate fiscal policy. Two years later, [he wrote](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/feb/06/europe-cant-cut-and-grow):

&gt; But, as demonstrated by the experiences of Greece, Portugal and Spain, this course leads to biting, deep recessions and worsens public indebtedness. The IMF acknowledged as much last week. A focus on growth, not austerity, is the correct answer for Europe's ills.

Notice IMF's acknowledgement. Unless if you also claim that IMF is an evil leftist institution.

Now let's see what the head of the Institute of International Finance had to [say today](http://www.cnbc.com/id/47333047):

&gt; The focus has been too heavily placed in short-term budget cuts and this has created the feeling that the situation seems bottomless. ... I think Germany will have to, with other euro zone partners, re-evaluate the current economic strategy here and ... rebalance the growth-austerity equation ...

I don't see a budding Che Guevara here.

&gt; Common sense dictates that when you encounter a injured person bleeding massively, the first thing you do is to stop the bleeding.

Correct. And you don't stop the bleeding by strangling this person, which is what we're doing now.

As for the populist rhetoric, common sense asks for the use of facts. For example, I wrote this above:

&gt; Of course, there's the usual mythology of the populist media, where Greeks drive Porsche Cayennes (in reality only 1 is sold every 2 days, where Greece's population is approximately 11,000,000). Not to mention the usual suspect about statistics. In 2004, after 2 years in the Eurozone, the new Conservative government started recording expenditure for defence equipment upon payment of the deposit, instead of recording it upon delivery. Retroactively, this change had the effect of increasing government deficits prior to 2004. The result? The revised deficit figure went 0.07% higher than the established limit (3%). But accusations about this are hypocritic, because this is still lower than the equivalent revised deficits of other member states that joined the Eurozone at the same time. Putting it differently: France was above the limit and couldn't join the Eurozone.

So, you have gossip rags writing about Cayenne owners and Porsche's German spokesman denies it. You have Sarkozy talking about ""Greek statistics"", but France's deficit was even higher than Greece's. And of course, my favorite is about Germany demanding strict conformation to the Maastricht criteria, while Germany's debt to GDP ratio was much more that the specified limit, even before the start of the crisis.

If you have any hard data supporting that:

a) Greeks are paid ""hilarious wages"" and the cost of life is easily met,

b) populist media filled with nationalistic overtones, and politicians acting out of self-interest didn't distort any facts regarding Greece, and

c) the extreme austerity program works and is the best way towards a solution to the Eurozone crisis

EDIT: just some notes, though. Not sure where they filmed it, but if someone would come to my house, and wanted to read a book, they'd be invited to do so... No need to ask. Or if they want a cool beer... it's not like the fridge is locked. Go ahead and grab one! Must be a very prudent family they've been working with.

EDITEDIT: Some more notes, I just feel like writing right now:

+ Belching is bad? There are places on this planet where a good burp after a meal is a sign that you enjoyed the meal. Besides, how else are you supposed to pass gas? Would you rather like your guests to fart instead?

+ Eating manners are good and fine, but by no means a national requirement. Nobody's gonna watch your fingers while you eat...

+ Be punctual? This is a really stubborn stereotype, one I can't agree with, because nobody I know is serious about punctuality. Arrive when you've arrived, don't rush yourself. A good friend wouldn't care, and if it's about your job, you better know your priorities. But as far as I can tell, that goes for each and every country on this planet...

+ Bring a small gift everytime you visit someone? Only if you wish them to drown in flowers and cheap chocolate. It's not *necessary*, really, but is appreciated nevertheless.

+ Never leave the table while others are still eating? I don't know about you, but only my parents made me sit until everyone finished. If you've reached adult age, nobody is going to *make you* sit down until everyone's finished... 

+ Germans don't enjoy (unproductive) smalltalk? Man, amazing what things the germans apparently don't like... I do enjoy smalltalk, be it as unproductive as a snow blower in the hot summer. And I'm sure i'm not the only one... There's only one way to find out: Try it out! :P

+ Don't force the friendship? Germans aren't some sort of extraterrestrial lifeform, we *are* humans ...

+ Don't say hallo, but your family name on the phone? Jesus, but i've been saying ""hallo"" all my life on the phone... Am I going to be arrested now?

+ Never call a german after 10PM...? Er, now it's getting outright ridiculous.

+ Do not call elderly people between 1PM - 3PM in the afternoon? Yeah, I agree. But I'm sure that goes for other countries as well, no? What kind of inhumane person would not grant grandmama her beauty sleep?

A lie using an obmission is just that: A lie. You quoted out of context.

The IMF is a pet of the United States, which happens to start the printing presses every time they can to heighten the amount of dollars around. Eventually, this will lead to a crash far more catastrophic than either of us can imagine right now. It is not surprising the IMF is against austerity.

Getting 14 monthly wages per year is pretty hilarious, and having had wage increases of 12-15% in the 2000s is so, too.

Mr Lane further argues that it would have increased the fiscal room available during the crisis, too.

The Turks say they ""intervened"", you know what else they say? They call the Turkish invasion the ""Cyprus Peace operation"", ""Kıbrıs Barış Harekâtı"". These are lies constructed to protect themselves to their own people, to justify their invasion of Cyprus. 

Greeks were absolutely not a threat to the Turks on the island, in the way the turks pretended. Yes, the Greeks were politically motivated to join Greece, but absolutely NO WAY WAS THERE EVER A GENOCIDE. The Turks have bought this myth that Greeks were doing a genocide of Turks in cyprus. This is a lie. turkish terrorist group TMT even admitted this themselves, that they staged attacks on turkish villages and killed children, turkish cypriot families, to scare the turks and make them more nationalistic. The first ""terrorist attack"" by Greeks against turks, was actually staged by the TMT turkish nationalists and framed on the Greeks, it took place in 1957 in the Nicosia post office, you can search of you dont beleive me!!!!

Last time I checked, a PEACE OPERATION DOES NOT INVOLVE:


- 200,000 REFUGEES INCLUDING MY FAMILY
- 2,000 RAPED WOMEN
- 1619 MISSING PRISONERS OF WAR STILL UNKNOWN OF THEIR WHEREABOUTS
- 10,000 DEATHS
- 37% OF MY COUNTRY ILLEGAL INVADE AND OCCUPIED FOR 38 YEARS
- 50,000 TURKISH SOLDIERS ILLEGALLY MILITARISING THE OCCUPIED ZONE
- FORCED MIGRATION OF 150,000 ANATOLIAN SETTLERS TO INVADED CYPRUS IN A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO DISTORT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE ISLAND (IN CLEAR BREACH OF THE GENEVA CONVENTION)
- ILLEGAL SALE OF REFUGEE HOMES IN INVADED CYPRUS
-DEMOLITION AND DESECRATION OF RELIGIOUS ICONS, CHURCHES AND PRICELESS ANCIENT ARTEFACTS.

I bet you must be so proud of your PEACE OPERATION!!!!

It could be for various reasons really: perhaps some greeks understand that it wasn't the euro that destroyed their country, but the policians they voted in. A lot of euroskeptic media will immediately try to take the latest results and turn it into being anti-euro... do you honestly believe 7% of the population supports nazis? They did it to scare the international community into considering more growth plans and perhaps being a bit lighter on the austerity or getting them a better deal on their debt.

One of the realities of a eurozone exit for Greece is that it will have [VERY BAD consequences for the banking sector in Cyprus](http://www.cyprus-mail.com/panicos-demetriades/greek-result-could-spell-more-trouble-cyprus-economy/20120508). It will be the first country to be hit by it as it's one of the biggest creditors of Greece (especially when you account for the size of the economy compared to others). So if a few smartasses were kinda like ""lets stick it to the troika"", the ""troika"" would probably not be affected as much as arguably their best ally, Cyprus.

I believe a likely outcome is that a government won't be formed and they will go to elections again, this time with a ""pro-europe"" coalition forming, with the international community being slightly more eager to cut Greece a better deal now that the greek people have warned them that they may be willing to screw their plan up completely.

The uncertainty behind what would happen during a greek euro exit (having to lock down the borders/financial systems etc -- effectively suspending their EU membership), and the almost certain screwup that it would cause Cyprus in the near-term (and probably permanent damage in relations between the two countries) is more than enough reason for any sane politician of Greece to rule out a eurozone exit.",0,1336516106,null,0,false,0,c4lprn9,t3_tdha8,t1_c4lprn9,t1_c4lo1wh,null,1428884788,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Right right, but really, this is a non-issue.

It's a little bit more complicated than the author tries to put it. Consider the size of germany. Compared to the USA, the open, livable space in germany *will be* quickly exhausted if every newborn child would instantly become a german citizen. Apart from that, there are only very few who face this ""issue"" - and even if you do, you'd still have good chances to become a german citizen, for example, if you've gone to the kindergarten &amp; school, you've likely already passed the minimum 8 years of required stay in germany in order to become german.

More importantly, ""being born in germany"" would be an excellent reason to ask for citizenship, and it's usually at least considered.

Plan on riding the [Metro](http://www.metromadrid.es/en/index.html) (here is a [map](http://www.metromadrid.es/export/sites/metro/comun/documentos/planos/Planoesquematicoingles.pdf)), the subway system in Madrid is extensive and will get you very close to anywhere you want to go.

A note on eating out in Madrid - Restaurants can be expensive so pay attention before you walk into a sit down place with table service. Instead look for little places that say 'Bar' or 'Cafe' or places that serve bocadillos (small sandwiches) and you can find lots of dirt cheap food and drink. I particularly enjoyed eating tortilla (in Spain tortilla is an egg and potato concoction similar to a crustless quiche) for breakfast with coffee. 

If you're vegan/vegetarian you're going to have a bad time. There will probably be ham in everything you order. Fortunately there are a ton of markets selling food so it will be easy to buy and make your own dishes if need be.

**Main Plazas/Architecture:**

Its worth checking out the [Puerta del Sol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerta_del_Sol) and the [Plaza Mayor](http://www.aviewoncities.com/madrid/plazamayor.htm) at some point. Don't eat in the Plaza Mayor though, all the restaurants are tourist traps, simply walking out of the plaza itself will reveal block upon block of good, and more authentic, restaurants and cafe/bars. Getting off at the Sol metro stop and then walking to the Plaza Mayor is a great way to see the central heart of Madrid. 

There is also the Royal Palace and the Cathedral of Madrid right next to each other. If you take the metro to the Opera stop and then walk west through the park you can take tours of both if you're interested.

My personal favorite area is around the Tribunal metro stop which is a little north of Sol. There are a lot of great little shops, cafes and bars worth checking out.

**Museums:**

The Prado is the most famous and largest museum in Madrid and has a wide range of classical to modern art. Overall though I would say that going to the [Reina Sofia](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/index_en.html) is a better use of your time. The Reina Sofia has a  really good selection of contemporary and modern art and you will get to see Guernica which is one of the greatest paintings of the 20th century. There is also a very good impressionist museum across the street, more or less, from the Prado called [Thyssen Bornemisza](http://www.museothyssen.org) Museum which I also highly recommend.

**Other Ideas:**

There is a great open air street market, [El Rastro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Rastro), on *Sundays just south of the La Latina metro stop that is pretty awesome too.

Overall Spanish beer is all pretty light but their wines are great. Unless you're really picky about your wine whatever the house wine is will tend to be pretty good. If you want to be adventurous and sample some different types then look for wines from Rioja and Ribera del Duero as both regions produce consistently good vintages.

That being said there ~~is~~ was a neat little brewpub not too far from Sol, and just off the Plaza Santa Ana, called Magister. The address ~~is~~ was Calle Principe 18. Still a neat area worth checking out around the Plaza Santa Ana though. 

edit: El Rastro is on Sundays, not Saturdays.

I'm from the UK, but I'm British rather than English and not native (the only relative who fought in WW2 invaded Russia). When it comes to the EU the majority don't hate it. What we do have are concerns about the way it is being run, which I don't think we're alone in this. And I do think there is a slight issue with having been victorious in WW2 but have it all fall apart, going from running a huge amount of the world to being flat broke in 50 years will hurt any nation. However this is largely limited to the baby boomer generation (the ones who grew up with with tales of empire and beating the Germans). There is also a lack of involvement in Europe, where as for most Europeans other parts of Europe are a car drive away it takes some effort for us to get to the rest of Europe which is just a result of being on an island, so we're isolated from it in some ways. Which means that when it comes to European politics we don't tend to take notice until things have already happened.

Regarding Pakistani immigration, this isn't an EU issue, it's our own immigration policy which is at fault. Immigration isn't a bad thing but we've not really done a huge amount to integrate immigrants in the UK, and immigrant populations have tended to clump together. This means that in some parts of the UK whole areas of towns and cities have had a complete change of demographics and culture in under a generation. Which has reached the critical mass required to remove all need for immigrants to integrate or in some cases even learn English. If you happen to live in some of these areas if does mean that you now live in an area where native white English people are pretty scarce. And this doesn't work well at all, I don't think it would work well in any country with any immigrant group (the British population in Spain are an example of how this can be a problem). 

Lastly, like any country we have our own population of stupid people who like to moan about everything and are often louder than the people who aren't moaning, to the point where you don't realize there is anyone else. The problem is compounded by the fact that for some reason, you all seem to be able to read English which makes it much harder for us to hide. I don't doubt there are Germans who do just the same things, but since I can't read German I have no idea what they are saying.

and even if it turns out that Tito played as large a role in Guardiola's tactics as suspected, even if it turns out he's a brilliant motivator and man manager, the era will still be over; different coach, different style... it's impossible that he'll be able to keep the style Barça will play with under him equal to the style they played with under Guardiola. especially if Alves is sold this summer, as is rumored.

so, in that sense, this Golden Era is indeed over. but if Tito can work some magic and keep the trophies coming, in *that* sense, it might not be. they still have the same key pieces, the same basic philosophy. it could happen.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;Communism is a socioeconomic model for the redistribution of wealth. It has been co-opted by dictators, but there's nothing it that requires a dictatorship.

Not in the written theory, but the practise makes it virtually inevitable.

&gt;In fact, there's nothing in it that requires any abrogation of your rights at all, except the unfettered ability to own property (some would say the right to exploit other).

That's a pretty big right, there.

&gt;Unfortunately, in its incarnations up until now things have gone quite wrong.

I don't think we can blame its incarnations any more. Communism fails because it virtually entails dictators. It's happened almost every, single, time. The horrors that have followed are greater, if not outright worse, than those ever seen on earth before.

Nazism promotes militarism, violence, ubermencschynes, etc.

To say that they are different in theory and therefore should not be equivocated is fine, if we're talking in theory. But I'm talking in practise, and in practise communism has turned out to be bloody horrific in the 20th century, and there are no grand examples, with a few almost acceptable ones being the best straws one can grasp at.

Ultimately, both ideologies have lead to the death of millions in the 20th century, and for this reason I think it a massive double standard or ignorance that we are so offended by the flag of one, but not of the other.

I don't care if communists in West Europe never got the power they required to do horrible things (and I know they lacked the intentions to), they followed an ideology that has always lead that way, and for that reason, it seems just as abhorrent as the far rightists to me.",0,1336547122,null,0,false,0,c4lw3gn,t3_tcpvx,t1_c4lw3gn,t1_c4llfow,null,1428887821,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,___alt,ZZZZZZcoq,Coq,"&gt; La justice ce n'est pas de castrer ceux qui ont réussi. 

Triple sophisme dans ta phrase. Le premier est de sous-entendre que la fiscalité est forcément excessive car castratrice. Considérant que les inégalités de revenus se sont creusées ces dernières années en France, le constat me semble manifestement faux. 

Le second sophisme c'est de réduire les hauts revenus à ""ceux qui ont réussi"". N'oublions pas que ça inclut des gens dont la seule réussite est d'être né au bon endroit et au bon moment. Non pas que cela doive les vouer à la vindicte populaire, mais c'est une piqûre de rappel essentielle : l'impôt républicain est un outil primordial pour limiter les inégalités. Il ne les effacera jamais (auquel cas on taxerait tout le monde à 100% avant de redistribuer et ce n'est pas le genre de société dans laquelle on voudrait vivre) mais il permet d'éviter de creuser les écarts entre les plus aisés et les moins aisés.

Le troisième sophisme découle des deux premiers : c'est de penser que ceux qui réussissent l'ont fait ""malgré"" l’État, malgré l'impôt. Là aussi piqûre de rappel salutaire : l'impôt ce sont notre système de santé, notre système éducatif, nos routes, la force régalienne qui fait respecter l'état de droit. Qu'ils fonctionnent ou non de façon efficace ne doit pas faire oublier que ceux qui se sont faits ""tout seuls"" doivent en réalité beaucoup à la République.

&gt; Il faut arrêter de leur taper dessus pour des raisons idéologiques.

Il me semble que la justice fiscale est une bonne raison de critiquer une taxe, fût-elle ""idéologique"". Aujourd'hui, l'idéologie dirige de nombreuses évolutions de la société et pas nécessairement dans un sens qui profite au plus grand nombre. Le bien commun, c'est une notion idéologique. Ça n'est pas pourtant pas sale. Ce qui est important, ça n'est pas qu'un jugement soit idéologique ou pas, c'est l'idéologie sous-jacente.

Okay, so you're not actually trying to start a discussion, you just want to vent about something you think you've observed. Not a good start.

&gt; It pisses me off because they are not neutral at all: 

No one is ""neutral"", the countries within the Euro have a vested interest in it. In fact, the UK has a vested interest in seeing the Euro succeed. Collectively, most of us don't want to join the Euro for reasons that have frequently been discussed in /r/europe.

&gt; They fucking hate the euro, the EU and any kind of such Union.

No we don't. We don't ""hate"" the Euro, we just didn't want to join it because we thought it was a bad idea. The Euro is currently struggling for the reasons that we said it would struggle, so we've been vindicated in our decision not to join. Nor do we hate the EU, we collectively voted to join 30 years ago, and political parties that advocate *leaving* the EU get a [much smaller part of the vote](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/) than, say, the Neo-Nazis did in your recent election. So, calling us all ""anti-EU"", is kind of like assuming all Greeks are Neo Nazis. In other words, it's a stupid thing to say, and is based more on ignorance and prejudice than fact. 

&gt; They are attached to their Imperial past and they try to prove every chance they get that they are not because ""it's ages ago"". This is absurd. Greece has parts in its history that are ""ages ago"" and still hunt them. 

So, you think we are attached to our past as an Empire, but you can't actually demonstrate this in any meaningful way. Sounds like another one of the prejudices you're projecting. You might as well throw the same accusations at the French, or the Germans, both of whom had Empires within the same time frame. Oh, wait. Hang on, I forgot that a lot of the Greek press have basically spent the last year calling the Germans Nazis. Maybe you pull this crap all the time.  

&gt; I for one I'm bored and sick and tired of the condescending manner you assume everyone should hate the EU and the way it ""treats"" its nations. Just because you were born in the 80s or the 70s or later it doesn't mean your nation as a whole is ""free"". National traits such as a strong feeling towards another nation or nations or certain directions do not get erased just because a technical barrier was removed. They are entrenched in a nation and they last for decades, to not say more. And Britain is not detached from the ""glorious"" days of the Commonwealth/Empire/etc. You simply do not accept the least loss of sovereignty. You are nationalist to the extreme in that regard and the sooner you realize it the better for most of us.

I really have no idea what you're talking about here.

&gt; 2nd. You are a stronger country. Stop assuming a small country with Turkey next to it that on the first chance it got if it saw Greece unprotected by international allies would jump into North-Eastern Greece and Annex it to ""protect the minorities"" just as it did in Cyprus, 

This is Greek paranoia, and is frankly, one of the reasons you are in the financial mess that you're in. You're spending too much of your GDP on arms, preparing for a conflict that will never happen. It's insane. 

&gt; just as Russia did in Georgia, just as Albania did in Kosovo and so on; stop assuming such a country is like you that you can fuck off from any international agreement and just stay with your American friends judging small countries with a high nose.

Again, your English is failing you here. I don't know what you're talking about. 

&gt; Sincerely, fuck off.

Greece is considered a [First World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World) country by all international organizations, by all definitions. The cost of life is not dependent on ""guessing"" and making baseless assumptions, Economics are not Metaphysics.

Ad hominem attacks are not constructive. Nevertheless, I've linked to AMECO's database regarding the deficit and the revised figures. You could check it yourself, without any intervention from me. If the European Commission changed the database's format, I could link to a specific result. For now, you have to click in a few times, or download zip files and search in them. For your convenience, I already gave the figures above.

&gt; Ah, Hegel. Nice. And so quotable. And perfectly useless

There are countless similar quotes, by different philosophers, historians, and politicians. If Idealism is not your cup of tea, [Santayana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santayana) comes from the School of Pragmatism. 

&gt; Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

Extreme austerity is a recipe for disaster and leads us to a post-modern 1930s. And that's what the vast majority of the leading economists say, from Nobelists to researchers and investors (Krugman, Rubini, Soros and others). These people don't belong to the same School of economic thought, but they agree on that. Of course, you could disagree with them and ""guess"" you are right, because you think you are right. Some EU leaders thought the same. They failed. The US did not start an extreme austerity program, and now is on a better trail.

Conclusively: 

1) You did not present facts supporting your views.

2) You make assumptions based on ideological preoccupations.

3) You insult others.

DocTomoe, I understand that you've made it through rough times. But seeing that the people that helped you did not impose conditions that would be impossible for you to meet, I would expect that you'd be more considerate of the plight of others.
