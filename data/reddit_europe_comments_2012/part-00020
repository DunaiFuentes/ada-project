Is that because they have (up to now) retired really early? Do you know. That affects the productivity as well I imagine, skilled workers leaving early.

The reason your case got escalated to the Staatsanwalt (attorney of state) is simply that the cops HAD to do that. It happens automatically and doesn't necessarily mean that this will have any further consequences. 

It's not like you never had a drivers licence, your licence simply expired. This is something that couldn't have happened with a German licence since they are issued for life time. 

The Staatsanwalt will take that into account when he decides whether he will take your case to court or not. Usually they only do that when it is the countries interest to do so - for example when you did it on purpose, are a repeated offender, somebody got hurt etc. Since this doesn't seem to be the case I'd guess that your chances to get out of this without any more cost and trouble are pretty good. 

So now it is up to you to decide how to proceed. It is probably safest to get a lawyer who will do all the communication with the Staatsanwalt and who would represent you in court. That should cost about 500€. In this case you shouldn't respond to the letter you got, let your lawyer do that for you. Or you just risk it and respond with a short and polite letter, explaining that you hadn't noticed the licence was already expired, that you are very sorry, got no money and aren't even in Germany right now. Maybe even send a copy of your renewed licence along.

I think I would take the second route. The Staatsanwalt and the courts got enough to do with real offenders that they won't go through the trouble of dragging you into court. 

Edit: Now I realized this isn't even from the Staatsanwalt. So relax even more. Should you decide to go without a lawyer just send the letter I outlined, explain you were not aware that it had been expired. That should be it.

Je veux dire, bon, certes, la majorité des politiciens sont des pourris. Oui, d'accord. Soit, vous le dites et le répétez tout le temps, on commence à le savoir.

Je suis plutôt Mélenchon, par ce que c'est l'un des seuls dans lequel je me retrouve, qui est assez courageux pour être insolent et poser ses couilles).

- Suppression du regroupement familial.
- Réduction drastique du nombre de demandeurs d’asile admis à rester en France
- Remise en cause des accords de Schengen
- Renégociation de la Convention européenne des droits de l’homme, et notamment de son article 8 (Je cite l'article 8 : Il ne peut y avoir ingérence d’une autorité publique dans
l’exercice de ce droit (Toute personne a droit au respect de sa vie privée et familiale, de son domicile et de sa correspondance.) que pour autant que cette ingérence est
prévue par la loi et qu’elle constitue une mesure qui, dans une
société démocratique, est nécessaire à la sécurité nationale, à la
sûreté publique, au bien-être économique du pays, à la défense de
l’ordre et à la prévention des infractions pénales, à la protection de
la santé ou de la morale, ou à la protection des droits et libertés
d’autrui.)
- Les manifestations de clandestins ou de soutien aux clandestins seront interdites. (Pardon ?)
- Pour la création de lieux de cultes, fin des financements étatiques (lois de 1905) et INTERDICTION D'UTILISER DES FONDS VENUS DE L'ÉTRANGER. ( =&gt; Les Églises sont déjà construites, on sait très bien qui ça vise)

true,GuyWithLag,GREE,Greece,"As a Greek with close family still working as farmers, one reason why so many people (relative to the rest of Europe) work in agriculture is because it is still done by  small family units on relatively small plots of land. Not exactly subsistence farming, but the prices small farmers can get aren't exactly making them rich. 

Now, historically, we had a wave of urbanisation since the 50's which transferred a lot of people out from the rural areas into mainly Athens, with the agricultural production being kept level (and rising) by usage of tractors, pumps etc. However, mobility is the province of the young, and so the rural areas have been left with an ageing population, which cannot sell off their land because the pensions are so slim they need to work on their own farms to produce income for non-food items - such as heating.

On a different tangent: I am a public employee, however I worked outside the public sphere for 10 years before that. What most kills productivity in the public sector are two main things that are somewhat intertwined. First, the bureaucracy is extremely stifling, both for internal matters and for external. I work at an university (support personnel), and if I want a leave of absence, I need to collect signatures from 3 different organisational layers, submit the request for approval, and it will percolate up to the vice-rector for that. The procurement procedures for printer paper involve 12 signatures from 9 people, and one of them is the Vice-Rector in charge of the budget. And this is on pre-approved funds. Further, in most public institutions people aren't given really any flexibility on how to do their jobs. 

Second, the persons themselves will both reject any responsibility beyond what is thw absolutely minimum required to do their jobs, and take advantage of any and all possibilities and loopholes the institutions provide, which is partially the reason why so many people are required to do the most trivial of tasks - to keep everyone honest.

When the boiling point is reached and the social contract can't be kept with money or violence, then the establishment that made the deals with foreign countries gets swept away, things get nationalised under the new order, and all debt obligations are gone. That's when the creditors get itchy for a fight.  
As simonmasdotcom in this thread has said: there is violence of the rioters, and violence of the fraudulent monetary practice - if I were a Greek, my first priority would be putting the ex finance ministers on trial, trying to expose the fraud and roll back on the deals they've made. Over-exposed French and German banks can then suck up the losses and do some soul-searching on how to make better deals in this cruel world of international finance.  
But of course power doesn't work that way. The poor Greek establishment is now getting dragged through the halls of EU where every asshole who got burned on the deals with ex-finance frauds is cheering for austerity and ransacking of poor Hellas, just to cover his own incompetent ass. It would be funny, if not for ordinary Greek citizen getting shafted on shit they had no part of. Complete disgrace.

true,[deleted],null,null,"the people don't have much to do. the greek politicians (only the head of government of the previous, conservative government? highly unlikely) are/ might be guilty. how about the goldman sachs executives that proposed the credit swaps to the greek government? they say that the procedure was blessed by EU commission/ officials/ whatnot. Anyone that has anything to do with EU denies that and everyone is playing surprised and dumb.

this news piece is just an example: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17108367

as for greece stopping being a democracy, you must have missed quite a few indeed:

* the regularly elected government resigned.

* no ""free"" election allowed (how can elections be free when you're basically voting between two coalitions that are taking orders from EU and offer no alternative on the wild cutting is another matter).

* when the chance of letting the people have a referendum on the famous draconian measures came out (mostly as a speculation of the press? or some greek politician gone wild?) the various ""helping"" European governments made very clear that no such thing would have been allowed. The market also made their opinion very clear by going under just after the mention of the chance of the referendum. as a result, surprise surprise, the greek people is not allowed to have their democratic referendum. a referendum, by the way, that would have not presented the matter ""neutrally"" as it immediately was clear that if a referendum was going to take place was on whether or not Greece wanted out of the Euro, if not EU altogether: another way of saying ""take it or die"".

all of this while the emergency technical government is blatantly ignoring the will of the majority of the greek, as it has been coming out for about 2 years. they don't want to pay.

or, rather, they don't want to pay at these conditions (when none of the big heads at Goldman, or in Greek political and economical world, or in the EU is not going to suffer any drawback at all) AND then have quite a big chance to go bankrupt anyway. because (you must have missed this, too) the ""helping hand"" that some European governments are offering in terms of loans is not going to Greece at all. it's all going straight into the banks coffers.

finally: rioting in ""democratic"" countries is cool since the protest started in quiet disbelief, continued pacifically, started to go rough, went violent and there is still absolutely no dialogue.

in a democratic country when a consistent mass of people sends a message to the government, the government doesn't just say: ""tough shit, such it up.""

the protest in Greece didn't start yesterday. it's been going of for *years*. i guess you missed that, too?

also: I'm not saying that what is happening in Greece is the same as physical torture. On the other hand, you have to admit that there are shades of grey. When you are forced to abandon your kids because they *might* be better off without a family, or when you can't go to the hospital when you're sick because there's no medicines anymore... that's ok? that's not horrific, too, in a modern, democratic country?

My point is that Turkey has always been a 'bridge-country' for cultures and empires. It is as much European as it is Asian, which should not stop them from EU membership. What stops them from that are human rights violations, discrimination and internal conflict.  
Yet they will be admittet at some point. Europe needs them. For oil/ gas transfer and because the sources of Euphrat and Tigris would then be controlled by an EU country.

You have to admit that makes no sense.  
Your arguements on Turkey are weird to me, fossil fuels will stay very important for a long time and the importance of water as a resource is on the rise. Controlling most of Syria's and Iraq's water supplies would give tremendous power to the EU. I also never said, that we are supposed to handle their Baby-Boom. The fact is, there are a lot of Turks already in Germany.  
Also you exclude the entire autnomous region of the caucasus from Europe, like Georgia or Azerbaijan. Yet your version includes the Russian caucasus republics, which are mostly selfgoverned. What reason is there for this?  

I am just saying that the geographical version doesn't make much sense from a political, geographical and cultural point of view. I don't want to integrate North America or Australia into Europe, I give that much credit to geography, but I would include Greenland.

&gt; Israel is an exciting place to invest,&amp;quot; Michael Steinhardt, the former hedge fund manager who produced returns averaging 24% a year over almost three decades until he retired in 1995, said in a telephone interview from Fisher Island, Florida.

""“It is not only that our EU partners are angry about our lying to them (and to ourselves) about the state of our finances, nor is it only that they will have to help us politically or economically (or both), but there is also the rather damning fact that in many aspects the Greeks enjoy a more privileged life than their German partners in the EU. Through all this borrowing, Greek salaries and pensions rose far above (about 30 percent) Greek productivity. This means that even if salaries in many cases (though not all) were still lower than the German equivalent, pensions were higher, and usually paid at an earlier age. So there is no longer a feeling of the richer EU countries helping their poorer partners – Greece’s mess comes across as exploitation of the underprivileged by the pampered.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement#Retirement_in_specific_countries :just compare greece to germany, 64% of all germans aged 55-59 are still part of the workforce and have not retired, only 31% of all greeks aged 55-59 are still part of the workforce



http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2010/04/euro_crisis_0 :
""...that the ruling elite in Greece spent years buying social peace and electoral support from the Greek public with a torrent of unsustainable public spending. The whole package—civil servants with jobs for life, endemic corruption, generous pension schemes, weak enforcement of tax laws, special tax exemptions for hundreds of politically favoured groups, the abuse of EU funds to bankroll farmers—was a social contract, albeit not a very impressive one.

Germany, being a sovereign state and a democracy like Greece, has over the years developed its own social contract with voters. In comparison with the Greek version, it sets more store by thrift and budgetary rigour, paying taxes and monetary stability. Pensions have become less generous, but there is still lots of welfare spending on working age voters who fall through the cracks of the employment market. The German government worked over the years to secure voter consent for all sorts of things: for agreeing to work in a capitalist system, agreeing to wage moderation or sending money to the eastern half of the country after reunification.""


http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_1_08/03/2010_115465 :

""The late Andreas Papandreou’s strategy in the 1980s was to give the disenfranchised, who formed the bulk of PASOK’s voters, a shot at living like the middle class. If this meant throwing European assistance and subsidies around like political favors and giving pensions to people who had never contributed to social security (such as farmers), then so be it. At last, all those who had been shut out by the right-wing establishment which triumphed in the Civil War in 1946-49 – and which was thoroughly discredited by the dictatorship of 1967-74 – would get to share in the wealth of the nation. The fact that this new middle class was founded on wealth that the country was not producing meant that the economy broke free from all logic and went into its own orbit. PASOK established the National Health System and poured money into education but it also undermined the gains by destroying any semblance of hierarchy, accountability and recognition of merit in the public sector. This meant that no one really knew how much money was being spent nor whether those who deserved it most were getting it. Costs rose while productivity plummeted. A wasteful public sector, in turn, condemned the private sector to inefficiency and lack of competitiveness. New Democracy, especially in the 2004-09 period, made the situation worse by doing almost nothing to cut costs and increase revenues, allowing the economy to career out of control.""


http://thecitizens.blogspot.com/2011/06/how-did-greece-get-here.html

""Greece had a ridiculously generous welfare state for a relatively poor country. For example, Greeks were allowed to retire with generous benefits as early as 55 years old. That’s great for middle aged Greeks. But where is the money going to come from? The country was poor in comparison to the rest of Europe. The Greek per capita GDP is well below the EU average. Greece also has a particularly under staffed and poorly organized tax authority. Even when taxes are – on paper – sufficient to pay for government expenditures, the Greek government has extreme difficulty collecting those taxes. So the answer to the money question was BORROW IT!""

i can do this all night, but now its your turn to come up with some actual arguments instead of just questioning mine with your silly oneliner comments

in case you haven't noticed, there are real reasons why your country is in the shitter, and they have more to do with greek tax evasion, work attitude and corruption than they have to do with evil, evil germans ""forcing"" you to buy german submarines (my favourite bullshit argument coming from greek redditors all the time)

true,rpad,null,null,"The point here is that Hungary did reduce its deficit to 3.4% GDP, its true that in 2011 it was not under 3%, but even so, the objection of the EU commission is not that. The objection is that the deficit was reduced by nationalizing the private pension system. The commission says that that was a one-off measure, and not a long term reduction. What the EU does not consider, is that not just a big part of the country's debt was paid off from nationalizing the private pension funds, but every year the pension contributions are actually spent on paying out current pensions (instead of keeping the money privately managed in bonds and shares), and the pension funds are balanced now. So that means that the pension fund does not need to be funded from taxpayers money any more. And that means more money remains for bringing the deficit under 3%.

The EU does not believe that the deficit will be under 3% this year. Yet the objected amount, by which the deficit would go over 3% is about half the amount the EU wants to withhold. But the Big European Bureaucracy has to show example on someone, and Hungary is a popular target lately. The Hungarian government now aims for a deficit of 2.8%, just to be sure.

I wonder how is the other way to debt reduction better. Just look at all the huge riots lately in Romania, Spain, Belgium, everywhere. While there are austerity measures in Hungary too, these solutions tailored to Hungarian specifics made it possible that the population is not hurt that much in the measures.

You can, it might not be covered in the treaty and an disorderly default, but I think emergency laws would cover that. A country can *always* close it's borders in real dire emergencys, like a terror attack, and I can imagine the threat of a state actually disintegrating, looting, riots, vandalism, violence etc and everything that would happen is reason enough to call in emergency laws. 

I also think a lot of the voters/taxpayers in the countries that are constantly being asked to bail out other countries are getting tired enough not to care anymore if it's legal or not, they just don't want to pay more. Hell, half the politicians are going out saying that Greece has to quit, I'm sure they can find a loophole.

the city is ok, its pretty tame for a big city, for bigger holidays go to cologne (you will have an NRW pass, its not far by train).  most things besides bars close early, and grocery stores besides one in the hauptbahnhof are closed on sundays so make sure to hit up lidl on saturday.  also made sure to check out Real, Rewe, and Kaufland.  kaufland in particular, they are open a bit later and there is easy access from the U42 (which you can get to easily by walking or by bus, near emil-figge strasse). but there are some good bars in the innenstadt and some cool restaurants too.  make sure you know a few good recipes though because cooking there is good bonding and eating out can be expensive.  bring a few foods from home with you you can't live without (reese's, cornbread, gravey unless you can make it) and some foods that remind you of home you don't know if you can get there.

Just stop spending money on unnecessary things.


The current situation in Greece is great. They need to feel some hardships (such as, gasp, not having money to eat out in overpriced cafes on Sundays) to come back to reality and start living within their means. Maybe then they will start building a sensible economy.

In Germany, if you don't like the food, you don't go back to that restaurant.  If it's really fucked up, like it's cold or uncooked, then you send it back.

It's an archaic holdover from the times when religion played a bigger role and fewer women worked (and so could go shopping during the week).  Opening shops on Sundays doesn't automatically mean people will work longer hours.  It allows more people to go shopping, and creates more jobs - especially low-skilled ones like cashier or stockist.

Germany already has 300 Euro jobs that would be perfect for this.  It's a silly inconvenience, that's all.  It presumes that everyone absolutely wants Sundays off.  A more sensible approach would be forbidding shops from forcing employees to work on Sundays but letting them if they wanted to.  That way everyone would win.

Also Germany's public transit is amazing and nearly always to the minute. One minute late and the Germans start to wonder where the bus is.

From what I know the US is notable for being one of the last first world nations where you can use another persons credit card (I think they finally forbade that now, right?) - which is the most basic barrier against CC fraud. Better reasons for less credit card use: distrust against consumer tracking, extra fees (both on consumer and retailer side) and the fact that almost any daily purchase can instead be made with your [free bank debit card (EC-card)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cash).

I think it depends. Most shops and places seem to have some kind of policy where if it's less than $20, they won't check for ID. In fact, this might be encouraged by Visa/Mastercard. I would imagine that if I went to a store and tried to buy a $1000 TV with a card that I have no ID for they would not allow me.

On the other hand, I've only ever had *good* experiences with losing my credit card. I've done it once and I only realized it when my bank called me to report suspicious activity on my card, then I spoke with them for about 5-10 minutes giving him some information, all the while the guy was joking about how the thief just tried to buy a TV but of course was denied by the system.

I think stores may be charged a transaction fee, but not the customer. Some store, notably EDEKA and other supermarkets, demand a minimum purchase of usually 5 Euros before accepting EC cards with this reasoning. ALDI is a notable exception, I've bought milk for 66 cents at one memorable occasion.

Even for chains, this may be different in local stores.

Regarding credit cards, I have not had one yet (35 years old). There simply is no need, although internet transactions may demand it in the future. I therefore am illequipped to tell you how our system works in detail. I remember the fact that you could (apparently for the longest time) just use a stolen card for many purchases in the US as an outdated system that had been abandoned all over europe long ago, which prompted my original comment. I also understand this loophole may have been closed by legislation a few (!) years ago, at least for bigger transactions.

For example during a Greek national holiday celebrated with a military parade that the prime minister and the president of Greece attempts, Papandreou didn't even show up and the president of Greece had to leave after being booed and called a traitor.

Unfortunately for him, Papandreou didn't have good relations with the media. The media saw the referendum as a destabiliser and ran wild with it. It was scary to see the amount of media mobilization and the effect they can have on people. The greek population under the control of the media did a 180 degrees turn. You can find polls taken days before the referendum was proposed that show  that the majority of the people was asking for referendums. Days later everyone hated him for calling it.

The main reason? I am 100% not happy with the direction the US is moving, Democrat or Republican led. Basically, I was always told to get out if I didn't like it so much, so I did. I'm now getting a MS and PhD here in Germany. I absolutely do not plan on living in the US ever again.

true,[deleted],null,null,"no, i don't see a problem with Greece never having a balanced budget. or, rather, i see a greek problem that can be solved by deflating their currency and manage somehow. that's before the euro. now it's different, but their balance it's not just their problem anymore, hence, someone else should have checked it, shouldn't they?

i never said that what has happened was not greece's (or their people's or their politicians') fault. i'm saying that the greek people are not the only ones at fault (which i don't think anyone disputes?) and they are the only ones paying. they are an ""adult nation"".

their politicians are ""adult"", too, and if they broke international agreements and procedures *they* should pay, if not with jail, at least with a nice lifetime bar from public office. how about the managers of goldman sachs that advise europe today and created this mess yesterday? they're not adults? and the european technocrats that (according to who's speaking) either ignored this gigantic fuckup until the day it exploded in their face (because the former greek prime minster decided to share the news, not because of some investigation or sudden realization, mind you) OR knew and ok'd the whole process and are denying on all accounts today? they're babies? and how about the countless european head of states that thunder about the greeks today? they were asleep, too? and what about their battle against a central unified accountancy court that would double check every single nations budgets?

all of these people all have a share of the blame. all i'm seeing, though, is that the greeks have to pay, because they borrowed beyond their means, and the rest of the world just did a good job thank you very much. no surprise there are riots in the street.


Berlusconi: he was voted in by the same italians that have prospered thanks to his perculiar view of ""free"" market and ""common good"". if there were elections tomorrow, those same italians would vote for him again. and why shouldn't they? from their (faulty) perspective what's theirs is theirs and shouldn't be touched by the state. everything else can be acquired, no matter how.

""the adults"" as you are calling them are doing more or less exactly what berlusconi did. a demonstration of that is that berlusconi's party has stopped crying and is saying nice things about monti.


Berlusconi and what it meant to italy, europe and the world was well known by anyone who cared to do a half assed reasearch about the man. if i bought at your dinner table a guy who is rumored to have connection with mafia, would you shake hands with him? if you knew there were tapes of his female ministers discussion on how to best giving him head (something that your average minister doesn't do, i guess?), and speculations that people in his cabinets were there without having any merit, would you trust him when he speaks about the next economic problem or about human rights in pakistan? if you looked at the data and you saw what a horrible track record this guy had in his previous two governments, would you not tell to your banks to stop investing into that country economy?

and even if for some reason of realpolitik, you decided that, yes, you must respect the guy no matter what and allow him to sit at your table, shake your hands and talk about you two are the best pals and see eye to eye on almost everything, would it be ok for you, suddenly, one day, to throw a fit and say that he is fucking europe and is country should wise up NOW or else...?


these are all nice games that politicians play for us. it's a nice show, in a way, sometimes even entertaining. but when the times get rough, these ""sudden realizations"" can be read in one of two ways:

1. they are actually, real, sudden realization. berlusconi should be kicked out of politics because he's a joke. merkel and sarkoszy (and many others) should resign in shame for having less intelligence than a baby chimpanzee and reserve their ""moral"" talk for another occasion, preferably private.

2. they are not sudden, they knew for years. which begs to the question of why the blame is put on the entire italian population and ONLY on us. democracy? yeah... perhaps some italian would have voted differently if he knew the rest of europe (right, left, whatever) would have not considered berlusconi equal at the table. they probably knew... but it's different when there's official acts.

number 2 is a nice political manoeuvre, too: we accept that italians have put an asshole in power, allow him to the break the legs at this (competitor) country economy and then, just before it's too late for OUR economy, too, we force the country to pay what's due to us. all is fair in love and war, etc.

except we are supposed to be in a union. we might not be all brothers, but this kind of scheming is hardly friendly or neutral. it's a kind of a war with a smile on its face. and, if italians were intelligent, they would go to rome en masse, kick monti out of office and say: ""we are too poor. we can't afford to pay. bail us out or we're going bankrupt!"", which, by the way, is exactly what some greeks would like to do with their current government.

and you know what? they are right! not because they are stupid assholes that can't do maths, but because they understood perfectly what game is being played and they want to play it according to the rules, which demand for retaliations, ""laziness"", stealing, ""i-don't-give-a-shit"" attitudes... after all, if Greece goes bankrupt, it won't be the only one to fail. they are already in the shit. it would be ridiculous to expect that they're not ready to drag everyone else in it, when this is the situation.


as for me, yes. i am from italy and from the south. i can't say i'm always proud of both, but i can't imagine any place in the world that would make me proud all the time, so...

&gt;I don't see a problem with Greece never having a balanced budget. or, rather, i see a greek problem that can be solved by deflating their currency and manage somehow.

But that's what they've always done. Crash, rebuild, crash, rebuild. It's not sustainable in the long run, at some point they'd have to learn the lesson and change their behaviour. Why not now? Yes, EU should never have let Greece in the eurozone, but it's not some conspiracy that led them to ignore their better judgement, but a misplaced bout of idealism that decreed that, for rather silly nostalgic/historical reasons,  Greece should always be included in the European project. They hoped the Greeks would change their behaviour towards a more responsible one – after all, responsible adults don't use, much less max, the credit cards randomly mailed to them. They were wrong, Greece didn't behave as a responsible adult and is thus, sadly, classified as a teenager in need of tough love. Because when left to it's own devices, it'd never grow up, never break the destructive patterns of behaviour.

Yes, there are people in Greece who are starving (or better said, malnourished). But when they weren't starving it was because their Potemkin village of a state lived off borrowed money. What would be a better indicator of Greece's needing massive changes in how it's economy is run than that something as simple as (collectively) affording food meant (collectively) living beyond one's means?

&gt;perhaps some italian would have voted differently if he knew the rest of europe (right, left, whatever) would have not considered berlusconi equal at the table.

He deserved a seat at the table simply due to the Italian citizens having elected him as their representative. I doubt anyone had any illusions about the man, but he _was_ democratically elected. As the Austrian debacle way back when showed, you don't poke your nose in another country's internal matters w/o a good reason, so if Italians choose to elect a man who'd run their country into the ground, who are the other leaders – not elected by Italians – to tell the fucking bastard of a clown off?

Common currency changed that approach, eventually. It is still in it's infancy, yet it has already changed the rules to an extent we're not fully cognizant of. This is a realization that took a while to manifest – that you can't maintain wildly disparate patterns of behaviour if you're sharing a purse. The sooner a political union follows the fiscal one the better, because as it's become painfully obvious, it's sorely needed. But it's a very delicate process. If the ""debtor"" nations misinterpret the others' offers that are designed in the interests of them not losing face in the process (due to European solidarity and the still-lingering idealism) as somehow a weak hand and therefore negotiable to the extent that they really aren't, it may well become easier for the ""creditors"" to smash those selfsame faces in and accept their losses by kicking them to the curb.

You know, destroying national production in those pesky Southern countries like Portugal.

I could have agreed with most of your comment (if not the style), up to this passage. It's bullshit, and you know it. Germany, *nearly all of Germany*, including the German politicians that decided to go with the Euro were incredibly reluctant to do so. We had what we felt was the perfect currency, and enough European integration to go with it as well. (Note: I'm not saying our currency *was* in fact perfect, or we *had* enough European integration, just that a vast majority of Germans felt that way.)

So, to claim that Germany had this all planned out, ""re-shaping Europe"" to allow it to export more cheaply is a grotesque twist of reality. Fact is, once we had a situation we didn't really like that much (the Euro, in exchange for being allowed to re-unify with East-Germany), we (or rather: our industry, and, with a bit of a delay, German economic politics) *adapted* to the new situation. We nearly froze wages, (moderately) reduced social benefits as well as red tape, and invested into education (not enough, for my taste, but at least it was a step in the right direction.)

Conclusion: I'm **not** putting all the blame on the EU countries that are in deep financial shit now, like Portugal or Greece, that would be too simplistic.

It depends. The merchant pays a really small fee, I think, and a little more when they use the variant were they check in real time if your account has enough money.

yes, but then they would have done so at their own pace, and with the consequences they chose.

i'm ready to admit that what happened is not due to some conspiracy (until someone puts the proof of that on the table), but someone else other than the greek population has benefited by the magical disappearance of large sums of money. i think the protestors in greece would be less in number if they saw that those people are paying a commensurate price, too.

having goldman sachs as the mastermind of this swap disaster and one of the main economic adviser to the EU to get out of the crisis is criminal, for example.

&gt; after all, responsible adults don't use, much less max, the credit cards randomly mailed to them.

i've been in u.s.a. for a while and you'd be surprised to see what otherwise reasonable adults do when the marketing ploy is right and when the publicity obscures the facts.

it's reprehensible to let one's guard down. but it's understandable. after all, in the case of greece: i elected someone. he is saying that the swap deal will work. he and goldman say the eu ok'd it. why should i worry? i'll keep on spending.

stupid, perhaps. but understandable.

basically, i believe that the majority of people in greece (as in italy or other places) are extremely angry at themselves for having put their trust in thieves and liars. they would accept the draconian measures more easily if they saw they apply to everyone. since this is not the case, then they rightly (according to me) protest. it's not because they don't want things to change. it's because they don't want to pay for the change when other culprits are feasting at home with the money that disappeared.

&gt;He deserved a seat at the table simply due to the Italian citizens having elected him as their representative. I doubt anyone had any illusions about the man, but he was democratically elected.

very true. on the other hand, then, what's the need of a sudden, complete u turn on him? i hate him, but when i saw that he was more or less the clown of the situation, i didn't think: ""FINALLY!"", but ""how the fuck dare they treat an official figure of MY country like that?! after years of playing best friends with him?""

it would have been well different if he had been treated with cold detachment. such was not the case... and so the sudden change of treatment is inexcusable for me. not that they needed to be ""BFF"", but come on! to say that he needs to go NOW?! what's the point? he was already following their orders anyway.

Also natürlich hält Google nicht sämltiche Rechte an der Musik und soll das auch nicht, aber Google hat auch nicht die Nutzungsrechte für die jeweiligen Stücke in Deutschland erworben und kann ergo auch gar nicht davon reden, dass die GEMA ihnen die nicht eingeräumt hätte.

Google hat nie versucht sie zu erwerben.

Und genau das müssten diese Plattformen, wenn die selben Maßstäbe angesetzt werden wie bei Bürgern und Unternehmen dieses Landes.
Also wenn ein Radiosender oder eine Partyveranstalter die selben Songs spielen möchte muss er dafür Gebühren bezahlen die dann mehr oder minder an die Künstler gehen. 
Sony heult hier also völlig zu unrecht rum. Gerne kann diese japanisch-amerikanische Terrororganisation die Vergütung in Deutschland so weit senken, bis Google bereit ist den Künstlern den Betrag zu zahlen. Ich bezweifle aber das das passieren wird.
Es geht überhaupt nicht mehr um Kunst, sondern um Ausbeutung durch Verlage. Sony leistet nichts um Musik digital zuverwerten, sondern wandelt das in Geld. Wie zum Tode Witney Houstons.

Damit will ich nicht, dass es hier nicht genauso so kranke Firmen gibt oder die deutschen Verlage und Konzerne besser wären.
Jeder Besuch in einer Thalia Buchhandlung setzt das Karma eines Kunden auf null. Jede Platte von Kontor Records ist Geldverdienen mit einer als Remix getarnten Raubkopie.

Wenn Künstler ihre Musik selber hochladen ist es auch was anderes.
Und mit selber meine ich wirlklich selber und nicht nachdem man ein Vertragswerk unterschrieben hat, dass einem über Jahre eine Rechtekorsett aufzwängt.
Die angeblichen eigenen Uploads von Künstler sind doch nicht ernst zu nehmen.
Die selben Künstler nehmen ja auch dankend das Geld an, wenn sie einen Song in einer Talkshow ansingen und dafür die GEMA Gebühren bekommen. Es ist genauso Werbung, aber da solls was kosten?
Das ist doch genau der Knackpunkt.
Entweder ist Musik Werbung oder ich kaufe ein besonderes physisches Produkt wie eine CD/Platte.
Der Song der Band ist in meinem MP3-Raubkopierordner genauso Werbung für die Band wie auf Youtube.

Since it is only 2mins on foot from where I live, my flatmate and I went to take a look. When we reached the end of our street we could see barricades and police in riot gear standing behind them. We approached them (it was pretty dark btw, 8pm in the fall or winter I think), and one of the officers held up their hand when we came closer saying 'sorry...'

I grinned at him and said 'we just wanted to do a little riot tourism'. He grinned back, laughed and said (something like) 'nope, not here', and we went 3 streets up and to the left where it turned out we could see the assembled demonstrants without getting closer.

I'll grant you that I don't particularly look shady, but these were after all Berlin's riot police (which really don't have a good reputation at all), it was dark *and* there was a left wing rally underway to break into a fenced off area.

There is so much talent in Spain when you look at the rosters of some of the teams, they just need the financial backing to keep their current squads for extended periods of time and of course make some stellar purchases with the increased in budget if they choose to.

Please name an example, I still don't even understand what kind of store you are talking about and what the owners ethnicity or religion have to do with it. I wonder if we are miscommunicating somewhere, because if not your point seems almost absurd, sorry. (edited to being less blunt)

&gt; The issue is that individual businesses should be able to decide for themselves. 

Since employers always have the upper hand and will decide for more profit and against the interest of employees, our society has decided to keep the (almost thousands of years old) tradition of a work-free Sunday (edit: so far). I for one agree. Germany is a [soziale Marktwirtschaft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market_economy), which is fundamentally different from the laissez-faire capitalism that the US prides itself on.

It's just a complicated thing, so yeah, tell them before hand, so they can actually open separate bills.

If they denied splitting the bill then it's either cause it was too complicated for them, or most likely because you had 8 people and places have some kind of policy about not splitting bills for larger groups.

&gt; Also tipping - who tips how much, how do we split it? Who pays by credit card and takes the collected cash and so on.

OK, so you go with 4 people and tell them you want split checks. The waiter will bring each person a check with a price, and each person just tips X% of their own bill. I might choose to pay with card and give them my card, you might choose to pay with cash, whatever, we're treated separately.

You go with 4 people and pay together: one person is probably gonna pay it all with his card and give a flat X% based on the total tip. It's up to you guys to decide how you're going to split the money. Maybe you guys split it 4 way evenly, maybe you count up who ordered what later, who cares, their your friends and you're adult enough to decide.

&gt;but someone else other than the greek population has benefited by the magical disappearance of large sums of money.

In most cases, someone benefits. There's a difference in tone, however, between ""magical disappearance of large sums of money"" and ""loss of funds due to the inefficiency in the system"". First would be the easy way out, blaming intentional action on a relatively small group of individuals. The second would be accepting the fact that the money lost spread more evenly among the population, with more levels of the social pyramid participating in the systematic graft than is comfortable for Greeks to admit. The fear of being caught out is a powerful incentive towards finding someone, _anyone_, preferably external, to blame.

Fair point about the US, though we're talking about responsible adults here, aren't we? ;) Democracy relies on the citizenry being well-informed, thus ""understandable"" doesn't translate into ""excusable"".

The draconian measures _do_ apply to everyone (them being felt is a different matter); what you're asking, however, is for them to be applied disproportionally tougher on a badly defined group of individuals to even out the perceived suffering. Didn't the fight against kulaks teach us anything? Uncritical quest for revenge rights no wrongs and provides no absolution. The only way is to remake the system in a way that doesn't let whoever they were do whatever they did again. Can't do it? Outsource it to Germans.

&gt;after years of playing best friends with him?

But they didn't, did they? They merely afforded him the respect due to a head of a nation, irrespective of their personal views of him. Cold detachment isn't an option between colleagues in a diplomatic setting, but there's a limit to even the most stoic diplomat's capacity of suffering a fool. I doubt anyone in wider EU respected him who wasn't paid to do so by himself, and his continued presence at the head of Italian government badly affected others' view on the political judgement of Italians, but until he overplayed his hand and his hijinks endangered the eurozone he was considered Italians' own problem.

true,thelittlebig,NISA,Niedersachsen,"Ok, how long is this report supposed to be and for what academic level are you writing.  
Your answer will depend on this a lot.  
You need to differentiate between material/ economic classes and perceived cultural classes next. You should also think about dropping the word class, that is kind of 80s style. Mileu would be better if you are attempting a more complex analysis.  
Now in economic terms Germany certainly has its classes, but they are weirdly structured and don't correspond directly with the cultural class you will be perceived to be in. A farmer for example could be in in the low, middle or upper class depending on the size of his farm. Yet many farmers that would fit into the upper class in terms of material wealth will certainly not be included in it in terms of cultural class since they don't live in the environment as other member of the upper class.  
The same is true for many immigrant families. In my hometown one of the immigrant families came to Germany as supposed kurdish fugitives, later it turned out they were lebanese and illegaly in Germany. Yet nobody will kick them out, one because they have had children here and second because the family owns six stores. Yet despite their material they also want be counted among any upper class, in fact most people look on them as kinda lower class.  
Italian immigrants often suffer from the opposite. For Germans Italians are the people owning Icecream shops and Pizza shops, they are supposed to be well integrated. Yet their children have a very low rate of achieving the Abitur (highest of three types of German Highschool diplomas), almost as low as the children of Turkish families. So despite their low level of education and often material wealth they are usually not included in the really low class.  
The actual low class would probably be that of those that get Hartz IV (roughly: unemployment benefits) or those close to getting Hartz IV. In terms of material wealth they are seperated from the rest of the country and they are looked down upon. So they fullfill both criteria of being in the lower classes; Culturally as well as economically.  
Among these there are several subgroups, the most prominent being single mothers and immigrants from high unemployment areas.  
In short: Membership of the lower classes depends on multiple factors, such as immigration background, education background, material wealth, profession and others such as age (children are poorer than adults and many old people suffer from poverty, too, although there are rich old people).  
The same applies to the upper class. It is complex as fuck and by far not as simple as the usual rhetoric would have you believe. For a report you will of course have to include sources. For this I recommend the data provided by the statistisches Bundesamt. For books that disect this data I suggest looking inside a library.  

I would not expect a reddit post to explain the German social system to you. Other factors to consider for example: Nobility (has no power anymore, but a certain social standing), Religion (specifically catholic, Protestant, Islam, Buddhist, Hindi, etc.), City vs. Country (different definitions of upper and lower class exist in both and in the relations between both), south vs. north/ east vs. north (the standing of certain groups is better/ worse in the respective areas).

As for what OP was asking about : shopping depends on how much you are willing to pay for clothes/others. Well-known brands such Gucci or Chanel are located around Avenue Montaigne and Avenue George V. Lesser known but still expensive brands such as Chloé or the Colette shop are Rue du Faubourg Saint Honoré. Expensive jewellery is Place Vendome. 

Middle price (around a few hundred euros) are mainly Rue du Four or Rue des Saints Pères.

The hype place for shopping is Le Marais, there are a lot of second hand shops (also, Rue Etienne Marcel), design shops etc.


As for interesting places to see, the Louvre Museum, the Ile de la Cité and the Tour Eiffel are musts I guess ? However, take at least a day for the Louvre, and there is not really a point in going up the Tour Eiffel, it is not the most interesting place to go up and have a good view of Paris.
If you are fine with stairs, I'd recommend going to Montmartre and up the Sacré-Coeur. The view is breathtaking (and there is a very nice museum dedicated to Dali right next to the church). If you'd rather be cosy, go to the Ciel de Paris (the restaurant on the 54th floor of the Montparnasse tower). You can either dine there (make a reservation) or if you don't want to pay a lot of money for a dinner, just go there around 4pm or 5pm to the Bar Américain of the restaurant for a very nice view around a drink.

If you go to the Louvre, your best move is to go there on a Thursday because you can, after visiting it, go to the Musée des Arts Décoratifs (Museum of decorative arts), which is right next to it and opens until 9pm (only on thursdays).

The Jardin du Luxembourg and Parc des Buttes-Chaumont are nice parks for a stroll, and the canal and the small streets near Rebulique are quite a nice place too. There is a really good restaurant called ""Chez Prune"" there.


If you like a bit creepy or unusal places, there are the Catacombes and you can visit Paris' sewer system. The Pere Lachaise cemetary is actually a really nice place too. You can also tour the ""[passages](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passages_couverts_de_Paris)"", often overseen by tourists.


For a cosy bar/concert hall, there is a place called La Flèche d'Or, which was a small train station years and years ago.

1. All the TUs (Technische Universität) and RWTH Aachen. It really doesn't matter. Choose your University according to what your what you want to specialize in. Not the other way around.

2. Depending on the course. 1 1/2 to 2 years.

3. 2.5 GPA is minimum. But it won't guarantee a place. 3.0 GPA is recommended.

4. There is a shortage of engineers in Germany. As long as you speak German, it shouldn't be a problem. But that's theoretical. I have been looking for a job for the past 7 months. Due to unforeseen and unbelievable circumstances I haven't been able to find a job. So, fuck it, I'm starting my masters in a few weeks. Having English as your mother tongue is quite an asset.

true,thelittlebig,NISA,Niedersachsen,"Excuse my harsh tone, I am just really tired and have to get up in six hours. Anyway, I fear the German public might be misrepresented on reddit. All Germans on here speak some sort of English at least that means that they have some basic level of education. They also choose to eschew German speaking sides, which speaks for a more international mindset. I would guess mostly students and mostly left of center.  
Nonetheless I feel that the question is just to complex for an academic report. Just explaining the basic factors of it all would probably take a few pages and then you could get into the presentation of the classes in the media. That is, how the media construes the social question on what levels. How does the Bild Zeitung approach the subject compared to the TAZ? This would be important because the way the media represents and categorizes the mileus is very important for how the people perceive this issue. And perception is one of the biggest factors in determening someones class status after all. So someone of lower education, but with a stable income might read the Bild. He would then have a lower opinion of the poor and immigrants. Therefore the lower middle class and middle class often have a worse opinion of the actual (material) lower class than those of the upper class reading stuff like the TAZ.  
Yeah, it is frustrating. I suggest either narrowing the topic at hand down to something a normal person can handle or to just half ass the shit and write down something about the widening gap in material wealth, the increase in part-time and employment-at-will jobs, the bad integration of immigrants from 67 till today and some quotes from the government report on economical inequality in Germany from last year.  

Your choice, I am going to bed.

For books you might want to look at topics that aren't obvious to an outsider. You could look at books about the Bild concern and the Deutsche Herbst as well as the German 1968 movement for example. They should cover the conflict between the classes. For the more racist/ right wing view of the immigrant question I suggest Sarrazin's Deutschland schafft sich ab (or something like that, just type Tilo Sarrazin book into google). You might also want to look at sources about Willy Brandt and immigrants, some of them almost identify with him and are very fond of the dude. There should also be books about immigration in the post 90 (fall of the wall) area as well as books about the economic depression that some areas in eastern Germany face.  
All of these aren't directly related to the topic, but if you cannot find any other sources in your local library you have to take what you can get I guess and those books should give some insight into the whole clusterfuck.",0,1330038014,null,0,true,0,c3uc3vu,t3_q2ueh,t1_c3uc3vu,t1_c3ubvbb,null,1428408767,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

As an example: My mum works as a cashier at a supermarket and has the middle high school degree (We have 3 types of high school degrees). My father has the lowest high school degree and I go to a university this year. I noticed that this is more common as it was a few years ago because of very low fees for universities. 

My step brother is going to fail the middle high school degree at the moment. Since my parents are divorced, my father doesn't live here. That would put me and my mother financially in the lowest social category.

My father has 5 businesses, a house, and a nice BMW. He is obviously in the middle or higher categories. Not the top category but he hasn't financial problems.

So it is possible to be in another category than the stereotype says and it is quite common. As I was in college, I had a lot of foreigns in my class. I think we had 2 other people who are ""Germans"" (that means they, and their parents and grandparents, were born here). This is the biggest stereotype ever. The lowest social category is going to make the lowest high school degree. But, as you can see, it was totally different on my college. 

By the way: I referencing here to the British school system because it is the closest one. High school degrees are ""Hauptschule"", ""Realschule"", and ""Gymnasium"" until the 10th grade. College degree is ""Abitur"" and a college is a school that allows you to make any kind of ""Abitur"".

The reason for all this stuff is properly, that you can easily live with a not working young adult you have to support. You don't have to work with 16 and make a professional training and earn money because your parents can't afford you. Also, the working situation has changed. You have to have a high school degree to get a professional training. The lowest degree is not enough in most cases to get these trainings. So you can't just say ""fuck school I do the same profession my dad did and do the same degree"". So the social categories had to mix up in schools because the expectations the parents have for the carrier of their children (to at least do the same they did or better) don't fit with the school education the parents had anymore.

true,[deleted],null,null,"we're starting disagreeing on details, which means that we're more or less saying the same thing, but we have different approaches. for example:

&gt; There's a difference in tone, however, between ""magical disappearance of large sums of money"" and ""loss of funds due to the inefficiency in the system"". First would be the easy way out, blaming intentional action on a relatively small group of individuals. The second would be accepting the fact that the money lost spread more evenly among the population, with more levels of the social pyramid participating in the systematic graft than is comfortable for Greeks to admit.

I think it's the first. You think it's the second. without any formal inquiry on the matter (which is never been even mentioned) we will never know, and all the discussion on the matter is purely philosophical.

Personally, I tend to think people benefited for two reasons:

1. like it's happening in Italy, the average greek citizen is giving money and rights in exchange for nothing. there's no new system on the horizon. what you said about the balanced budget will happen again. trust me, it has happened countless times in italy, despite many ""tear and blood"" periods in which the governments of left, centre and right robbed the population blind. the politicians are all making big proclaims about fiscal integrity now. the moment the spotlight is turned somewhere else, they'll start doing what they have done forever. the general population will get some crumb, everyone will be happy, the system will be on the verge of bankruptcy again, and the whole cycle will begin again.

2. the investigation i'm talking about is not going to happen. why should they investigate? at this point, taking such a step would mean that the greeks might be right. in addition, it would show that a violent protest can achieve something. nobody wants that. hence, even if there's someone guilty, rest assure he will never pay for his guilt. (and there are guilty people... if nowhere else, there's someone at goldman).

&gt; The draconian measures do apply to everyone (them being felt is a different matter)

exactly. this comment reminds me of when prime minister Andreotti decided to raise the VAT on books. protests (not in the street, naturally and sadly...) followed. the reply: ""the increase in price will hit me as well as you!"" Andreotti was and still is extremely well read and i have no reason to suspect that he doesn't buy his books. on the other hand, he had the salary of a MP (including a *vast* amount of concessions on everything from food to cinema, from travel to phone bills). something your average person doesn't have.

the fact that a measure applies flatly to everyone doesn't make it fair. it's the apocryphal ""why don't they eat cake?"" that Marie Antoniette supposedly said when people were protesting there was no bread.

what i think would be fair would not just punish those that were instrumental to create this mess, but a fairer distribution of the payments. i don't have the specifics about greece (if a greek is reading this, i would like to know from him/ her. i don't really trust the international news on the matter), so i'll make examples about italy, where the situation is only marginally better (a demonstration of this is the insistence with which, for *months* all the politicians from all the spectrum have chanted that ""we're not like greece""...). not here, though, but in private.

Quelle est votre opinion SUR LE tricot? [C'est une question rhétorique, ne répondez pas.]

Est-ce seulement pour les grands-mères? La bonne réponse est non.

LE VOCABULAIRE DU TRICOT EST RICHE, donc malheureusement, je peuX juste VOUS DONNER QUELQUES MOTS.[finish giving out papers, next image]
 
Quand j'étais jeune, ma mère m'avait appris à tricoter, mais J'AI arrêté d'en faire à l'adolescence. J'ai commencé à tricoter à nouveau l'an dernier. J’aime bien tricoter maintenant, parce que je peut faire une oeuvre unique.  Aujourd'hui, je vais vous le prouver.
 
Nous allons en discuter un peu d'histoire. Nous savons que la pratique du tricot existe depuis longtemps. [show pic] On en retrouve des traces dans la Haute Egypte QUI datent du 3ème ou 4ème siècle. CELA FAIT mille sept cents ans. Ici vous pouvez voir d'anciennes chaussettes tricotées. [point at pic, then next pic]
 
Ensuite, SUR cette image CE SONT DES gants datant du Moyen-âge. [point at pic] Le présence du tricot en France et en Europe médiévale est très évidente. [next pic]
 
Pendant la Deuxième Guerre mondiale, les femmes américaines ont aidé les forces armées par le tricotage des chapeaux et des chandails. [point at pic]
 
Dans l'histoire, la transmission de ce savoir faire était familiale, comme le crochet et la dentelle. [show items - lace and crochet, next pic]] Autrement, a-t-on appris DANS UN livre. Aujourd'hui, on peut apprendre à tricoter en ligne.
 
Maintenant, je vais vous montrer ce qu'il ya dans cette boîte. [hold up each item] J'ai des fils, des aiguilles, et certaines de mes oeuvres. Il Y'A DES FILS DE toutes les couleurs, et il y a des aiguilles de toutes tailles, mais je n'en ai pas beaucoup.

“Que pouvez-vous faire avec le tricot?” Bonne question! Ensuite, je vais vous montrer quelques choses que certainEs PERSONNES font avec le tricot.

&gt; In the US a different tax rate can apply to the same product depending on the buyer. An item could be exempt from tax if it is bought by a business for resale. Food bought with food stamps is exempt from sales tax. In South Carolina, if you are 85 (or over) a lower sales tax rate applies.
On top of this is the problem with local sales tax. Some of the beach communities have local sales tax (to shift tax burden to nonvoting tourists and off the local property owners) on top of the state tax.


&gt; Sales tax is actually pretty variable. It changes over time; much easier to just adjust it in the register. Sales tax is local. There are also different city taxes that can be applied and if the store is a chain, different taxes can be applied at different locations. Some things, like food, get taxed differently depending on their ingredients.
Also, the person purchasing the item may be exempt from paying certain taxes.

Doesn't explain why restaurants don't do it, but this is why stores don't do it. It's very true though that taxes can change even just by doing down the street (and entering a different Stadtkreis (if that's the proper word)).",0,1330078540,null,0,true,0,c3ui894,t3_q1lo9,t1_c3ui894,t1_c3uhra2,null,1428411716,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1
