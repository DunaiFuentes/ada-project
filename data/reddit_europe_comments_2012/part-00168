I don't and that's why a lot of pro-EU people are very worried about eurosceptics because some people, like yourself have the opinion that reform is needed, a perfectly reasonable one which many pro-EU people can agree with. Some have the opinion that no reform is enough and we must get out at all cost. That latter is UKIP's position but they are bundled in with the former as 'eurosceptics' meaning the idea that we leave at any cost is over represented. It also has an effect on how people will vote. If people are unconvinced by the EU they gravitate towards the sceptic side and are presented the word 'eurosceptic' and shown Nigel Farage as its quintessence. When they hear &gt;50% of people are euroscpetics they see a united front of those in favour of exit when in reality many if not most have more nuanced views like yours. As they associate with euroscpetics they are being forced into associating with the OUT vote possibly unwittingly and often by the paper they read. That is why a referendum is scary. People are not voting based on the facts but because of the polarisation of the debate they are being pushed into an IN/OUT option where any sceptic is told by their chosen media to vote OUT even if when pushed or better informed they would say reform is preferable as you do. Its therefore important that as Blair says people are informed and there is an argument made for the EU and IMO an attempt to de-polarise the debate possibly by having a referendum with a REFORM option which would mean the voter is IN temporarily unless reform cannot be achieved.

true,canteloupy,ZBSuisse,Suisse,"Mais la culture nécessite une application, des aptitudes, et un intérêt qu'il faut bien reconnaître est absent chez une bonne partie de mes congénères (c'est à dire les humains). Et on n'empêche pas d'enseigner des branches de culture générale dans les écoles des apprentis, cependant aux côtés de branches qui permettent d'avoir une application directe dans le monde du travail (ce qui est aussi une motivation puissante à l'apprentissage chez certains). Je trouve aussi ça normal que certains aient besoin de comprendre à quoi ce qu'ils apprennent va leur servir, c'est assez humain, on n'est pas tous motivés par la philosophie pour la beauté de la chose non plus sans que certains soient forcément plus intelligents ou éclairés que les autres.

Pour avoir suivi l'enseignement secondaire en France, je dois dire qu'ayant été une des meilleures élèves que mon lycée ait connu et ayant suivi un cursus scientifique plus des options bilingues, je suis très admirative du programme que j'ai suivi et j'estime que j'ai pu en tirer la quintessence de ses enseignements. Mais pour la majorité de mes camarades qui n'avaient pas forcément envie ou peut-être pas la capacité de suivre 100% du programme, je dois dire que le niveau du 10/20 (ou du 8/20, limite pour avoir le rattrapage) est tellement médiocre que je doute qu'ils aient retenu quoi que ce soit qui leur reste. Peut-être que je me trompe et qu'en fait ils en sont sortir grandis mais je ne suis pas convaincue qu'enseigner le Père Goriot (d'ailleurs c'était au collège) aura beaucoup illuminé leurs vies.

Si ça se trouve en plus en voulant un enseignement généraliste très ambitieux pour tous on achève d'en dégoûter certains de la culture et la science. J'aime pas tellement l'idée d'une société à deux vitesses et j'aimerais beaucoup que le ""pareil pour tout le monde"" marche, mais quand j'étais en cours de physique en première S et que la prof devait faire des groupes de niveaux pour 1. les élèves à 5 qui espèrent atteindre le 10 un jour (le plus gros groupe), 2. les élèves entre 10 et 14 qui espèrent atteindre le 15 peut-être avec un peu de chance et 3. les trois restant qui peuvent espérer au dessus de 15, je me demande si vraimetn ça sert à grand chose de vouloir faire passer tout le monde par ça. Je suis bien contente d'apprendre dans ce thread que les bacs pro et techno ont gagné en popularité, même si je n'en connais pas le cursus. Le bac général n'est manifestement pas adapté à tous.

En fait ce que je me dis c'est que bien qu'ambitieux et très adapté à certains élèves qui du coup sont très contents de le suivre, le cursus que j'ai eu était probablement malgré la compétence de mes profs majoritairement hors de portée de certains. De plus l'impression dominante pour ceux qui s'en foutaient était que de toutes façons ils finiraient bien par avoir le Bac... ce qui n'était pas amélioré par le fait que j'étais dans une école privée et donc les parents allaient assurer l'avenir de leurs rejetons d'une manière ou d'une autre.

Le système que ma soeur a intégré en Suisse était totalement différent, avec des branches à option où les profs rappelaient sans cesse aux lycéens qu'ils avaient choisi d'étudier et que c'était donc leur responsabilité. Certes, cette organisation a ses défauts mais bon l'approche ne me semble pas plus mal. J'ai aussi aidé une apprentie à apprendre l'anglais pour ses cours et il me semblait qu'elle était clairement plus à même de suivre cette formation là qu'une formation généraliste ambitieuse, ce qui ne l'empêchait pas de s'intéresser à beaucoup d'autres activités comme la danse, avec le bonus qu'elle a trouvé du travail sans problème après son apprentissage. Et je connais d'autres apprentis qui se sont découvert des passions pour des domaines plus théoriques durant leur apprentissage et one poursuivi des écoles après avoir terminé. Il y a des passerelles partout.

Celà dit il paraît obligatoire que n'importe quelle formation qui destine un jeune citoyen à la vie en société ne soit pas uniquement tourné vers son utilité pour une entreprise. L'apprentissage de l'esprit critique et une bonne dose de culture sont indispensables.

Also keep in mind that I just disagree with the notion that ""I consider it more important to reach the less talented kids than the really bright ones"". Ideally, everyone gets what he needs of course.

&gt;How would you identify these children, then?

We'll use the same criterium you use to identify the challenged ones, just the opposite end of the Bell curve.

&gt;a) [citation needed] (as I said, IQ is not a predictor of future contribution to society)

However you want to define top potential, if someone out of that group doesn't realize his potential it's a bigger loss than when someone of low potential doesn't.

&gt;b) you were advocating for special education programs, not psychiatric prophylactic ones.

Depression, demotivation and lack of proper study habits are certainly not exclusively caused by psychiatric illness.

&gt;there isn't a lot of evidence that investing in special education for the top percentiles of IQ results in any kind of measurable benefits for society (and perhaps not even to the individuals).

Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. This could just as well signal a lack of interest in the matter.

&gt;No, less gifted ones are definitely, and statistically measurably worse off without special help.

Compared with their potential? See, that's the crux of the matter: you want to bring everyone up to a certain minimum: a laudable goal which I support. However, you ignore that the same effort would do just as much to improve the achievement of someone else, and that the return on investment will be higher because these people can do more than an average person.

We have limited means to spend on these issues, and instead of focusing everything to try to bring the lower end of the Bell curve up to average, I think it's more beneficial to society as a whole to invest some of this support in the higher end of the Bell curve.",0,1354186933,null,0,false,0,c78ivfv,t3_13v9qu,t1_c78ivfv,t1_c788s6p,null,1430530797,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Following that complete economic meltdown the assumption seems to be that inflation will save the day because, you know, everybody loves to invest in a country where a 10% profit evaporates instantly.
Economic meltdown will speed up the current brain drain, making it even less attractive to investors.
Moreover, another currency will do nothing to battle corruption and inefficiency.

**Legend**

(?) = not 100% sure.

\* = xyz is the name of the university, not the place, right?

\*\* = name of the subject you made your master in, right?

*** = **""another random course""**. Note: What course? Do you want to insert a name there or what? Seems kinda strange to say ""I completed some random course which I do not want to name here, so it could actually be a course that has absolutely nothing to do with this as it was about watching birds during noon.""

My opinion is that there is a small (but not extremely small) part of them who do not intend to assimilate and reject french identity and values. They often live in really bad neighborhood and tend to stick to it, with some kind of anti-french racism. For them, Islam is more of a way to reject french values even more, by interpretating islam this way (you can make any religion not stick to western values, depends how you read it), and they go around yelling that they want France to be turned into an islamic state. So, yeah, these people are a problem, are dangerous, and they tend to be more and louder than before, probably due to the economic and social crisis.

Apparently if you crunch the numbers you'll find that with the current debt values, interest rates and assuming an unrealistic optimistic outlook on a healthy Greek economic surplus, Greece will not be able to get its debt back under controllable levels within 2-3 decades.  Using realistic figures instead, a picture of an impoverished nation forever in a debt trap emerges.

It's basically the situation in sub-sahara Africa for the past five decades. Any monetary aid going to that continent is dwarfed by the outflow of money in the form of interest on debt and harboring tax shelters. 

The report then speaks of haircutting all debt (not just privately held ones), then throwing them out of the eurozone so they have some control over their own depreciated currency. Greece would still not be 'saved' after all this, but at least salvageable. Remaining in the EU itself would still guarantee EU subsidies coming their way to help with that.

So, no to the corroboration, then.

&gt; So there is an open door policy then? Europeans have no right to live here so there's no reason to open the door to them. UKIP want to put an end to this open door policy as do most people.

I disagree, they do indeed have a right to be here, just as we do to go there. One of the best thing about Europe, tbh.

&gt; I'm aware of the policy it's just awfully unspecific and poorly thought out.

Agreed, though I suspect for completely different reasons.

&gt; They're in England so they should submit to English culture. Immigrants can't come here and expect to live like they're still in wherever they came from.

Sure they can. As long as they conform to UK law and some basics of our cultural norms, they do nothing but enrich our own culture.

&gt; Not being far left is bad now?

Nothing to do with being ""far left"". Finding the idea that the guy down the road might celebrate kwanza, or whatever, instead of Christmas offensive and ""wrong"", is simply bigotry. It's so clearly and aggressively bigoted that I am left to wonder if it isn't being used as code for something else entirely.

Other countries however get poorer and poorer, since no one wants to invest in the ""poor"" or ""unsuccessful"".

I think there may be an argument that entrenched values in old people still exist, but I don't think they will ever change their values, they'll simply die. However I think to look at the HoC and automatically say that there only being 148 females out of 650 is down to sexism is a huge jump towards a faulty conclusion.

This is not really correct. While I agree the urban planning was not totally thought ahead and those buildings are ugly as shit, they were not built to park immigrants.

They were originally built in the 50's to replace the squalid housing and other shanty town ( bidon ville ). 
It was considered great by people living there at the time, heating and water available directly in your place was a huge improvement.
So people who leaved there at first where factory worker and people from the surrounding countryside.

I'm not saying it is now a great place, where you do not find any shops or activity around. But at the time it was pragmatism thinking about housing and not ""rabbit cages"" for immigrants.

Em... you do know this is pretty standard procedure when applying for a visa, right?

I've had to do it for Iran (took 5 weeks), Pakistan (only 2 days), India (2 weeks), China (3 days), Vietnam (2 days), Laos (2 days), Thailand (2 days), and Myanmar (3 days.)

These were all straightforward, with the exception of Iran and India which were far from straightforward (I got one Indian visa quite straightforwardly, but my second, in Tehran, was a clusterfuck.) Maybe a typical Russian application is more complicated than these two but I doubt it.

Visa forms often ask for a lot of information. This doesn't necessarily mean you have to provide it. They almost never check beyond the obvious (e.g. if it asks what countries you have been to, you list those with stamps in your current passport- they are not going to have any way of checking anything beyond that.) I've been somewhat liberal with the truth on many occasions.

Some countries have visa free entry for Westerners and others sell you at the border... but if they don't, you have to go to the embassy/consulate, fill out a form, provide whatever documentation they ask for, pay a fee and give them your passport- for whatever period the processing takes.

I can guarantee it is a hell of a lot more difficult for a citizen from a developing country to go to the West, (generally, the answer is just: no) and many developing countries 'retaliate' by making it not so easy for Westerners... although arguably those with sense swallow their pride for the sake of the tourist dollars.",0,1354200540,null,0,1354200868,0,c78kw86,t3_13x6pp,t1_c78kw86,t1_c781cl0,null,1430531747,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Note: this is only an issue if you both share a currency, or are guaranteeing convertibility.

If you have your own fiat currency, it's just some country working hard to acquire more of your paper dollars. You keep on running a perfectly sustainable government deficit to keep money in circulation within your economy whilst funds are withdrawn - just some paper (or numbers on a computer rather) is withdrawn. Meanwhile your nation's had the advantage of consuming those imports for less exports than went offshore.

Someday later, the exporting country will decide to stop storing wealth in this fashion, and may start spending their savings they've made in your currency. At this point the whole process reverses, the funds come back, the government suddenly finds surpluses straightforward to run (and desirable, to keep interest rates down in the face of the inflationary pressure of funds coming back onshore), and the spending country acquires the exports they earnt all those years ago when they first sent you imports.

No crisis at any stage along the way. A foreign country just stored a bit of wealth in your currency by selling you imports, then later, buying exports. Nothing much to write home about. Prices and importantly wages remained stable throughout, there was no crisis of unemployment, the government debt was perfectly sustainable, all perfectly fine.

Of course, if you share a currency trade surpluses are a whole lot more sinister.

Similarly, if you have problems with Social Democracy then you are surely an American.

Why can't just everybody accept that people have a brain on their own and can have different opinions than their national average?

And even more importantly, why don't people organize amongst international ""ideological"" or worldview lines instead of just national lines?

Even you are not being helpful, even though I like your common-sense conservatism.

I don't even believe a deficit to fully employ even need have such a large impact on the currency. Say the government ran a [job guarantee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_guarantee) program - the only real impact on the exchange rate is the marginal propensity to import of those workers, as balanced by the elasticity of the export sector. There's got to be a stable equilibrium point in there well above ""currency tanked"".

true,SuperLoutre,loutre,Loutre,"C'est certain que ce type de reportage peut faire sourire ou choquer de nos jours. Mais comme il est expliqué les grands ensembles ont été une réponse à un lourd déficit en logement après guerre. Il y a eu les destructions d'habitat, la croissance démographique mais aussi l'arrivé massive de pied noirs d'Algérie, à Marseille notamment. Mais pas que. Avant guerre les classes populaires ne vivait pas non plus dans des conditions très alléchantes. 

C'est avec l'essor économique de la France que les politiques ont commencé à intéresser au logement de la population. A l'époque ce sont les architectes modernes (fonctionnalisme) qui ont montré la voie. En effet, jusqu'au année 40 l'architecture ne s'intéressait pas au logement collectif non bourgeois. Hormis quelques exceptions (HBM, familistère), il n'y avait pas vraiment de réflexion sur l'habitat du peuple, des ouvriers, on les laissés plus ou moins croupir dans des bidons villes. 

Le tant décrié Le Corbusier a pourtant était un précurseur avec ces [Unités d'habitation](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cité_radieuse_de_Marseille). Le bâtiment est une machine à habiter. On construit sur pilotis afin de laisser le plus d'espace vert possible. On orient l'édifice en fonction de la course du soleil, une rue intérieur au coeur de l'immeuble offre tous les services nécessaires, le toit est un espace public dimensionné comme une piste de course pour le footing matinal. Il y a même pour chaque appartement un réceptacle pour que le livreur de lait laisse sa marchandise sans vous dérangeait, les premiers vide ordure, ect... Bref un trésor d'inventivité qui font mouiller toutes les étudiantes en architecture du monde.

Alors certes quand il faut bâtir en masse en France à partir des années 50, les architectes de l'époque reprennent plus ou moins les idées du maîtres. Sauf qu'on enlève toute la richesse de l'habitat pensé par Corbusier. Les immeubles des grands ensemble ne sont pas multifonctionnel, pour faire ces courses ils devront acheter une bagnole, ne sont pas sur pilotis, les espaces verts sont trop chers à entretenir ; ne sont pas correctement orientés, on préfère la logique du chemin de grus ; ... Mais ces grands ensembles reste tout de même une sacrée avancé pour les nouveaux occupants qui découvre l'eau courante, les WC intérieurs, un grand salon,...

Le problème c'est que ces ensembles ne sont pas fait pour durer. ils se dégradent, on ne les entretiens pas. Et surtout l'urbanisme (au sens contemporain, cad comme discipline) n'existe pas. On n'a pas connecté ces gens avec un centre de vie. On n a pas réfléchi aux équipement public qui devaient accompagner ces nouvelles densités. Peu voir aucun transport en commun. Très vite les gens s'ennuient et souhaite partir. Ils partent et sont remplacé par les nouveaux pauvres du pays, les immigrants. Le manque de service publique (dont la police, les pompiers, centre culturel) et d'emploi ghetoise ces zones, vous connaissez la suite.

Pourtant aujourd'hui, demandez à n'importe quel urbaniste, architecte, géographe, il vous répondra que la plus grande catastrophe urbanistique du siècle dernier n'est pas là. En effet les grands ensembles sont facilement rénovable. Certain sont d'une réelle qualité architecturale ( de plus en plus sont classés en tant que patrimoine du XXieme siècle), beaucoup d'ailleurs ne sont pas du tout des ghettos ou même des HLM mais des résidences plutôt huppées très courues [comme la Rouvière à Marseille](http://www.culture.gouv.fr/paca/dossiers/xxeme_marseille/monographies/0937_38_rouviere/rouviere.htm). Bref il y a un certain optimisme envers ces constructions. 

Par contre, rappelez vous les gens qui ayant accéder à une classe social supérieur ont quitté les grands ensembles. On leur a vendu le rêve du pavillon individuel avec jardin. L'accession à la propriété, l'individualisme, l'étalement urbain à outrance, la disparition progressive des terres agricoles ne sont que des conséquences de ce qu'est réellement la problématique du territoire au XXIieme siècle.

What happens... when people decide that actually they'd rather be employed by the jobs guarantee program than anywhere else? If a sufficient enough number of people do decide that isn't that likely to dangerously unbalance the economy and cause stagnation?

This idea sounds nice in theory, in the same way that Keynesianism sounds nice in theory, but never works in practice because it relies on politicians to play by the rules. And they never do, they change the rules to suit themselves and bribe the electorates to be re-elected.

true,TheMania,null,null,"Politics is quite capable of making anything go wrong, yes. But you ultimately have to trust the government with control over the money supply. All the issues you foresee apply just as much to control over interest rates, so we usually elect a government that delegates control of them to a slightly less political ""independent"" (although only to a degree) central bank.

The issues are much the same, and we could do the same here - grant the ability to set the guaranteed wage to an ""independent"" third party. Basically, if the guaranteed wage is too high for a given level of taxation and spending, you get inflation, just the same as if interest rates are set too low. The correction for the JG is to either reduce the deficit, or lower the guaranteed wage.

The thing is though, if you simply wait it corrects itself. The JG wage is in theory **fixed**, apart from very occasional adjustments. As wage inflation sets in on the private and public sectors trying to attract people away from the ""too cosy"" JG, these stagnant workers ultimately leave the JG for the higher pay elsewhere. The rate of money injection slows, stability is restored and the JG sector size is back at the [NAIBER](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_guarantee#Inflation_control), non-accelerating-inflation buffer employment ratio. This is one of its many advantages, that it's a largely self-balancing system.

Yes, if a bad government comes in and keeps on adjusting the guaranteed wage upwards you'll run into problems. Same as if they handout a bunch of money to the electorate - this would be inflationary and ultimately a very unpopular move. *At least* with your own currency, the damage a government can do is largely limited to their one term. They screw up inflation for a bit, they get kicked out of parliament for the next few decades and the next mob in can correct it quite quickly by pulling money out as quickly as they can via high surpluses (assuming they are themselves competent).

Rape does have a lot to do with inequality, because the potential victim, who usualy (although not always) is a woman, is being held responsible for doing all sorts of things, which are supposed to prevent someone from raping her, like dress and behave in a ""non-provocative"" way, and thus often either feels guilty for ""causing"" someone to rape her with her improper behaviour, or faces such accusations when reporting this crime. There are still a lot of people, who belive women should remain in their houses and focus on the family and household duties, ""act naturaly"", and find excuses for rapists- such as the growing number of succesfull, working women, who seem not modest enough and threaten men with an aggresive approach towards life, claiming the earlier male-dominated life-spheres as theirs. A lot of rapists have a contemptuous approach towards women, sometimes caused by a general, media-generated image of women as sex-objects (this is more visible in e.G. Italy, but I did say- sometimes).	

Although rape is a problem of crime of course- it also is rooted in a general approach towards women and men and where they belong.

I knew which particular scene from ""Yes, Minister"" this would be and my reply is simply that, on the contrary, the other nations of Europe are perfectly able to fuck everything up without any assistance from us. A cursory perusal of news reports pertaining to the introduction of the Euro from the late 90s to the early 2000s demonstrates, for instance, a marked leniency towards economic conditions in certain countries (Greece, for example). The further back we go, we see almost every country's entry into the various European aggregate systems is marked by each and every country being counted as an 'exception' to some rule or other. The simple fact is that the EEC / EU was a political proposition, for political ends, by politicians who didn't give a fig about economic sustainability or the very rules they drew up for that supposed purpose. 

The philosophy of the rapid growth of both the EEC / EU and the Euro seems to have been ""it'll all work out ok in the end, if everyone's linked in we'll be too big to fail.""

My standard disclaimer applies: I have no problem with the idea of a European Union or European Federal State, but *this* union is fundamentally flawed, poorly implemented and based on outdated, obsolete political ideals, philosophies and a fundamentally incorrect approach to democratic processes and economic processes that has not been designed to survive the potentially disruptive influence of modern technology as it is currently manifesting in finance, manufacturing, resource allocation and information.

Traditions and cultures change. It is not long ago that racism was widespread (and it still is in some parts of the world) and also widely accepted in society. For example one defence of slaveowners was that it is ""part of our culture/tradition"". Parts of the animal rights movement are using the term ""speciesism"" because of the parralels between treatment of animals and minorities. (I can certainly see that this may make some people angry that misunderstand this. They are not saying that minorities are like animals obviously.)

Je connais quelques anciens étudiants de Science Po qui seraient heureux d'avoir le même parcours à son âge. Surtout que Science Po seul, sans passage par l'ENA, HEC, une autre spécialisation, etc. fournit principalement les troupiers ordinaires des classes dominantes et petites-bourgeoises. C'est-à-dire, en général, comme Papa-Maman. Pas de quoi plastronner... une immense majorité des anciens de Science Po font des boulots ordinaires, au sein de classes moyennes sup, petits ou grands cadres au fil du temps.

Cela me fait penser aux réponses bourgeoises lorsqu'on critique les inégalités de classe, d'accès à la culture ou à l'enseignement supérieur, etc. ""Ah, vous êtes jaloux !""

Mouais, bof.

Science Po reste, selon moi, la cristallisation de tout ce qu'on peut critiquer dans l'éducation française.

C'est une machine à conformisme et à petite-bourgeoisie (la haute bourgeoisie y passe parfois, remarque). Pas mal d'anciens le reconnaissent, d'ailleurs, lorsqu'ils prennent un peu de recul sur ce qu'était leur lieu de formation.

Quant à la remarque sur Monti, elle me semble aussi déplacée que sa mention dans l'article, sinon plus. Qui peut se vanter, ou croire qu'on peut être jaloux d'assister à une conférence de Monti ? Pour un chercheur en socio ou en économie, on pourrait citer de grands chercheurs ou des Nobel. Mais Monti, quoi.

I'm still in the process with my future wife and boy you're in for a treat!
I'd begin by going to the Spanish embassy where you live and seeing if you can
do it there.  If you can't, I would get all the paperwork done in the US on
your part (birth certificate and ""marital status document, or whatever it's
called both with Apostille), you also need any non-spanish document to be
""legalized"" in Spain by a ""traductor jurado"".

In Spain you'll have to present ""Certificado de Empadronamiento"" stating that
one of you has been ""empadronado"" in Madrid for more than two years.  And some
proof that you've been living together for at least year.  When you get to
Spain, you physically have to go to the ""Registro Civil Único"" to get an
appointment (you can't reserve one on the phone or by any other means, don't
bother) by presenting your birth certificates and photocopy of passport, DNI,
etc.  In our case the gave us an appointment for a month later (that's why I'd
see if your suegra can do it for you).

At your appointment, you need to present the pile of papers and they'll give
you another date to pick up the ""expediente"" (authorization to get married), a
little over a month later.  Then you can choose to get married in the ""Registro
Civil"" or any other place within the Madrid Community.  We wanted to get married
as soon as possible, so we went outside the capital and had to pay a fee
because we weren't registered in that municipality (not all of them charge
though, e.g. Getafe).  Usually the waiting list in the city is over three
months.  Because each place only has one day a week when they perform
ceremonies.  You have to be very patient, it's a long and bureaucratic process.
Honestly if I were you, I'd just get married in the states and have the party
in Spain.  In the states the whole process takes about three days and a passport.  

We still have to do the green-card thing so we can't help there (let us know if
you find out ;)

I hope this helped,
Good luck and congratulations.

Disregarding the fact that Germany isn't attractive enough to gain 1 million immigrants in a day, Germany *is* doing its best to promote - together with local and national governments - skilled worker immigration. 

If you are interested, just look up recent immigration statistics or, barring that, stories in the english speaking parts of weekly German national newspapers that tell you about how immigration is increasing.

My point wasn't that there isn't a problem. In fact, I think what you mentioned is one of the most pressing problems the Eurozone economy faces. What I take issue with is that the general view of the US treasury, as depicted in the article, isn't concerned with such structural problems, rather than stating that Germany has a trade surplus, and must therefore increase consumer spending.

Such reasoning doesn't make any sense to me. You can't just increase consumer spending. People on a macro scale don't work like in your orthodox economic models. If they did, we wouldn't be in this mess. And Germans aren't saving because taxes are low or high, or because there is not enough incentive for consumer spending. Germans save because *Germans save*.

Was mich erschreckt und ehrlich gesagt auch etwas verärgert hat, ist dein Vergleich von Zoophilie und Nutztierhaltung bzw. -verarbeitung. Haltung und Tötung von Tieren sind sehr genau durch das Tierschutzgesetz und dessen Verordnungen geregelt, Praktiken welche dem Tier unnötige Leiden zufügen oder dessen Tod fahrlässig herbeiführen sind dort grundsätzlich verboten; auch ist für den Umgang und die Haltung von Tieren eine Sachkunde erforderlich.
Demnach ist (und war) auch Sodomie ab einem gewissen Grade strafbar (ich bin mir sehr sicher, das Sodomisten keinen Sachkundenachweis für ihre Handlungen besitzen) und zwar unabhänig von der Anzahl der betroffenen Tiere.

Ob ein Verhalten normal ist, ist ein sehr komplexes Thema, sollen sich damit ruhig Psychologen, Mediziner, Sozialwissenschaftler, Juristen und wer sich auch sonst berufen fühlt rumärgern.

Prague:

- Old Town Square

- Wenceslas Square

and many more. I can't really remember the names now, but there are plenty of things to see in Prague. These four are big enough as it is, for example there are churches and museums on the squares that you would probably like to visit.

Another advice I've been given about Prague is to be careful where you exchange your money, because some places have horrible rates.

Vienna:

- Schönbrunn Palace

- the Riesenrad

- Belvedere

- the Hundertwasserhaus

- St. Stephen's Cathedral

Again, these are just some particularly intersting places on top of my head. There are many museums as well, especially music-related. I wasn't particularly interested in seeing them, but you might be.

They might not sound very offensive but they do make a victim of rape feel, like she did something wrong and got raped because she's stupid, not because someone is - let's say- evil. Don't wear provocative clothing, Don't walk home alone at night, Don't drink too much, Don't talk to strangers and Don't accept drinks from them! It's the womans duty to behave well, so she won't get raped. It might sound logical, but if you're a victim of rape you don't want to listen about that.

This is an assertion, not an argument. I don't buy it. There's plenty of countries that are and/or have been in trouble (e.g. no ""full"" employment by long shot) despite having control over their currency. I believe the US would be an example. BTW there are plenty of people saying that even the US' current lending and quantitative easing are unsustainable.

Yes I have heard of such countries. More importantly, that is beside the point. Small countries like Greece cannot construct an economy on only internal trade. They need to buy goods in other currencies. Oil being one prominent reason, but there's plenty more things Greece will need to buy from other places.

To what end? The currency is quite stable as it is so that shouldn't be the problem. As I understand, the primary argument for currencial independance is inflation, i.e., instability. Even if there was a way to introduce inflation under the umbrella of the euro, meaning Greece not quitting, how is it supposed to solve the current problems?

In Paris I didn't think it made much of a difference. I speak French as a second language, and although I'm not (and will never be) 100% fluent, I attend university in Suisse-Romand and therefore use French lot more than English so I feel very comfortable in it. I also am lucky in that I learnt as a child and therefore don't have the 'foreigner' accent as much. Which sucks actually, because chicks dig it.

When I was in Paris I was meeting a lot of people who were nice to me at first when I spoke to them in French and then a couple of minutes into the conversation I would stumble over a word or something and I immediately got the 'tourist treatment'...it was like I was one of their own until I showed I wasn't French. Very strange. Didn't receive the same treatment in the rest of France, nor really in Switzerland. There's just a very strange Parisien mentality towards non-Parisiens.

And there are plenty that said/continue to say the same about Japan. For the last couple of *decades*. They've been wrong every time. Japan's not going to fall over ""any day now"" - they never will, and neither will the US.

&gt; I believe the US would be an example.

I would argue they're running an insufficient deficit for full employment. If you at all times run a deficit that meets the non-government's desire to save in your currency at full output, there need not be unemployment. [This](http://heteconomist.com/parable-of-a-monetary-economy/) parable explains it best.

&gt; Yes I have heard of such countries.

Can you name one? How can a free-floating currency-issuer be unable to make a payment in the currency it issues?

&gt;Small countries like Greece cannot construct an economy on only internal trade.

They can buy in imports the value of their exports. If they have *nothing* to offer the world, they are not able to sustainably import no matter what model you use. Obviously this is far from the case - even under the Euro, with an exchange rate propped up by Germany, they've been averaging some $60bn worth of exports every year. Under their own exchange rate, they'd export more. That's at least $60bn worth of imports due their way, enough for $5500 of imports for every man woman and child in the country. That ought to buy the essentials, no?

&gt;  They will not be fooled by a government that prints money not worth the paper.

Ah, you're one of those (many) people that sees bond printing as substantially different to money printing. *This is fine.* Under a Greece with its own currency, there's no need for money printing. As long its bonds are assumed to be as safe as the cash Greece issues, Greece would find no shortage of willing ""lenders"" at not much about the interest rate set by the central bank. So bond printing would be absolutely fine and sustainable, like Japan/Singapore/USA/UK/Canada/Iceland/etc today.

Second, you want to work for an organization that you do not understand? How much have you thought this through?

Anyway, hear are the important organs of the EU:

[The Council of the European Union](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/homepage?lang=es\)), meets in different constellations (e. g. Foreign Affairs Council) on minister/government level. All defence ministers, all finance ministers, etc. Legislative institution, has right to initiate new laws. 

[European Parliament](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/es), 'second chamber' of the legislative branch. Highest democratic legitimacy, is voted directly by the citizens in elections, does not have the right to initiate legislation. Does not vote on all potential legislative proposals, but most. 

[European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/index_es.htm), comprised of one Commissioner from every Member State (until 2014). Commissioners do not represent their country but are independent to serve for the Union as a whole. Has right to initiate legislation. Makes sure Member States adhere to European law. 

[European Council](http://www.european-council.europa.eu/home-page?lang=es), not be be confused with the Council of the EU or the Council of Europe. Heads of state and governments, sets general guidelines for the EU.

[European Court of Justice](http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/), as per the name the primary court of the EU. The Commission can sue Member States before the ECJ for violations of European law. 

[European External Action Service](http://www.eeas.europa.eu/index_es.htm), the 'foreign ministry' of the EU. Is headed by the High Representative of the Union For Foreign Affairs and Security Policy who also directs the [European Union Institute for Security Studies](http://www.iss.europa.eu/) and the [European Defence Agency](http://www.eda.europa.eu/). The EEAS has some intelligence capabilities ([Joint Situation Centre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Situation_Centre)).

There are basically two kinds of EU legislation. One is a [directive](http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/introduction/what_directive_en.htm) which has to be transferred into national law, and second [regulations](http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/introduction/what_regulation_en.htm) that have binding effect as soon as they are passed by the EU and do not need transfer into national law.

I would not call my experience Racism but rather stupidity. And there is lots of it in the world. 

Ive experienced a shit load of racism back home in India and in Malaysia (where I was born and worked for a few years). I personally feel Asian folks are a lot more discriminatory in general.

It is very wrong to confuse and mix racism with stupidity and unfortunately these days many journalists mix them both to sensationalize their news. Down side is that real racism is simplified. And  they end up placing importance to an idiots intellect.

Watched a programs on TV last night where some kids were playing in this village where they let bulls run though the street. There was an Arab kid and some other kids tells this boy : ""Bulls does not like arabs"" or something along the line... This was given as a example of the village's intolerance. For me I laughed at it and found that statement STUPID, definitely not racist at all. I worried so much for the kids who actually said that because they obviously lack intellectual stimulation.

People, working class folks, we get along. We all want the same things. Pay them bills, educate our kids, and get by peacefully.

&gt; Also keep in mind that I just disagree with the notion that ""I consider it more important to reach the less talented kids than the really bright ones"". Ideally, everyone gets what he needs of course.

No; you quite clearly said ""it's a waste of effort"", when quite clearly, it objectively is not.

&gt; We'll use the same criterium you use to identify the challenged ones, just the opposite end of the Bell curve.

Fine. IQ it is. But while for the lower percentiles the risk is clear, and the special programs' help evident, for the upper percentiles this is not the case at all.

&gt; However you want to define top potential, if someone out of that group doesn't realize his potential it's a bigger loss than when someone of low potential doesn't.

So now you're to switch it to ""potential""? As I said numerous times before (and you haven't bothered to address): Even if I agreed with this notion (and I certainly don't; I think it's a far bigger tragedy to have people preventably live worse-off lives than it is to have people live good-enough lives but that ""could have been better""), special programs for the gifted **haven't shown** (to my knowledge) that they can truly help these children ""reach their full potential"", whatever the hell that might mean. Put it another way: unless you show me otherwise, why should we invest money on something we're not even sure that works?

&gt; Depression, demotivation and lack of proper study habits are certainly not exclusively caused by psychiatric illness.

Depression **is** a psychiatric illness, motivation is only within the reach of the person involved (if you don't believe me, ask any psychiatrist working with drug addiction), and discipline isn't something one majoritarily gets from school anyways.

&gt; Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. This could just as well signal a lack of interest in the matter.

This better be a joke: if you want to justify investing public money in it, you damn well should **show** that it works beforehand. Otherwise, I have this perfectly nice bridge for sale over here... Besides: the matter has very much been studied. ""Evidence of absence"", scientifically speaking, is not attainable. Much like we can't prove god does not exist. But when you look for something and don't find it, well...

&gt; However, you ignore that the same effort would do just as much to improve the achievement of someone else, and that the return on investment will be higher because these people can do more than an average person.

Prove this, and I'll be completely in agreement with you. It's not that I despise gifted children or anything, mind you (what with me having been one and all that..). I just think it ridiculous that people would demand programs that haven't shown to be good for much other than give the parents of said kids topics to try and make their friends envious about.

&gt; We have limited means to spend on these issues, and instead of focusing everything to try to bring the lower end of the Bell curve up to average, I think it's more beneficial to society as a whole to invest some of this support in the higher end of the Bell curve.

Well, that's your opinion. One I disagree with, but respectable nonetheless. But I'll tell you why I disagree: Think of it in terms of money: would you think it more valuable to society to invest in letting some people achieve ""millionaire"" status, or to get absolutely everyone out of poverty? As you yourself said, resources are definitely limited. I'm nowhere near against investing in gifted children (provided it's a program that's proven not only to work, but also that it won't have any unintended consequences), as long as we've already achieved the goal of helping every and all children with special needs. The smart kids will do OK without the help.",0,1354269865,null,0,false,0,c7929uz,t3_13v9qu,t1_c7929uz,t1_c78ivfv,null,1430540401,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Er wird nicht vollendet, trotz allem Geschrei  
Der Raben und der Eulen,  
Die, altertümlich gesinnt, so gern  
In hohen Kirchtürmen weilen.  

Ja, kommen wird die Zeit sogar,  
Wo man, statt ihn zu vollenden,  
Die inneren Räume zu einem Stall  
Für Pferde wird verwenden.  

»Und wird der Dom ein Pferdestall,  
Was sollen wir dann beginnen  
Mit den Heil’gen Drei Kön’gen, die da ruhn  
Im Tabernakel da drinnen?«  

So höre ich fragen. Doch brauchen wir uns  
In unserer Zeit zu genieren?  
Die Heil’gen Drei Kön’ge aus Morgenland,  
Sie können woanders logieren.

true,nobb,null,null,"&gt;Dire qu'il n'y a pas de pluralité dans l'enseignement des IEP me paraît étrange. 

Rétrospectivement, ce que j'ai dit n’était peut être pas clair. je répondais précisément a ton :

&gt;Sentirais-je poindre un peu de jalousie dans l'article ? Le propos aurait été plus sérieux si l'auteur avait laissé de côté ses jugements gauchisants sur l'enseignement de l'économie

ce qui je suppose répondait dans l'article a : 

&gt;Soyons transparent : j'ai étudié à l'IEP de Paris. J'en garde le souvenir de quelques enseignements stimulants, plombés par un tronc commun où prévalait une science économique recroquevillée sur le pilotage libéral des crises du capitalisme.

Et ce que je disais, c'est en substance que dans un cours d'économie normale, tu n'avais pas seulement du libre échange mais aussi de keynésianisme et, oui, souvent l’étude de Marx parce que ces critiques reste d'actualité (et je suppose aussi plein d'autre courant économique que je ne connais pas).  la pluralité dans un enseignement, ce n'est pas seulement une question a la con de ""représentativité"" ou autre chose du même acabit, mais de façon beaucoup plus pratique c'est l'outil pédagogique pour faire réfléchir au différent aspect d'une matière et développer chez l’élève un sens critique sur son sujet qui soit utile (dans le sens d'argumenté, nourri et dans le cadre de sa matière). Du coup je pense que c'est une condition nécessaire a un enseignement de qualité.

Au fond le commentaire de l'auteur est une plainte du manque de pluralité, ce a quoi tu réponds par ""il est jaloux le gros gauchiste"", ce qui me semblait un peu court. est ce que l'enseignement est moins pluriel a science po que dans d'autre établissement (ou dans l'absolu)? je ne sais pas, j'ai pas vraiment les moyens de vérifier. je dit juste que la remarque de l'auteur n'est pas a jeter.

&gt;c'est injuste de vouloir casser une formation de qualité simplement parce qu'elle ne se conforme pas à l'idéologie mitterandienne du diplôme pour tous.

L'accès des classes populaires, ce n'est pas une question de diplôme pour tous, mais une question d’accès possible par toutes les strates de la société à l’éducation sésame pour jouer un rôle politique dans la nation. encore une fois au passage, c'est une question de pluralité.

Quand a tes réflexions sur la fac, je ne peux pas dire que je sois d'accord. d'abord la fac a une selection a l'entrée, ca s'apelle le bac. le bac en 2012, c'est [77,5 % d'une generation](http://www.lemonde.fr/ecole-primaire-et-secondaire/article/2012/07/12/le-taux-de-reussite-au-baccalaureat-2012-en-legere-baisse_1733202_1473688.html) ce qui veut quand même dire qu'un petit quart de la population n'aura pas accès à la fac. de toutes façon si les fac rajoutait une autre couche de sélections à l'entré, certes ça ferait diminuer le taux d’échec en première années, mais de façon finalement complétement artificiel, parce que cet échec serait reporté sur les gens qui ne feront pas d’étude du tout, la fac tenant le bas du pavé (c'est a dire qu'il n'y a pas de formation supérieure qui sois en dessous de la fac en terme de sélection)  

honnêtement, je nais jamais compris le mérite de la sélections, pour moi c'est l'inverse d'une éducation de qualité. La partie la plus difficile de l'enseignement ce n'est pas de d’apprendre des choses au plus doué et bosseur, ça c'est la partie facile et sans grand mérite. la partie la plus difficile c'est d'essayer de prendre les moins bon et de les intéressée, les motivé et les faire progressé, non seulement dans leur savoir mais dans leur méthode d’apprentissage. Je ne dit pas que l'université y arrive particulièrement bien, juste que science po n'essaye même pas.

Quand à la fameuse efficacité de la sélection à l'entrée, ont peut tous aussi bien expliqué le succès des grandes école et école d'ingé par les effets de réseaux. je peux parlé d'experience sur ce sujet, je fait un doctorat avec un parcours a la fac et j'ai put comparer la différence de traitement entre la france et d'autre pays, notamment l’Allemagne (j'y ais passé une partie de ma thèse). On est dans une situation complétement absurde ou un doctorat en France ne t'ouvre pratiquement pas de lien dans l'industrie (les réseaux entre industrie et université étant inexistant, car monopolisé par les école d'ingé) mais des que tu bouge à l’étranger, tu devient extrêmement demandé (les doctorants Français ayant d’ailleurs une bonne réputation). si tu regarde l’Allemagne, tu n'as ni grandes école ou école d'ingé, seulement l'université. du coup ben les labo ont des lien avec l'industrie, et pratiquement tous les membres du gouvernement ont fait une thèse (c'est pour ça que les histoires de plagiat de thèse sont si important la bas, c'est le plus haut diplôme supérieur). Tu regarde Merkel, elle est docteur en physique-chimie. 

Pour conclure, avoir de petite formations qui sélectionnent plus qu'elles n’éduque s'accaparer tout les réseaux en France, c'est loin d’être super.

Là où on n'est peut-être plus d'accord, c'est que pour moi les grands ensembles c'est la naissance du mauvais urbanisme, celui où l'Etat ou la collectivité débarque sur un terrain et entend décider de A à Z. Il est intéressant de constater dans le documentaire le ton employé par le narrateur qui écarte vite les critiques (il faut savoir mettre ses critiques de côté et accepter en bloc la nouvelle architecture, accepter le nouveau mode de vie imposé par les quartiers denses, se soumettre aux règles d'une nouvelle socialité qui s'exprime par exemple dans les maisons de jeunes...). Derrière les grands ensembles il y a une certaine volonté d'ingénierie sociale, on voudrait transformer un peuple campagnard en peuple urbain.

Pour une partie de la population ces quartiers ont été vus comme une étape dans un parcours résidentiel, dès qu'ils ont pu le faire ils ont quitté les tours pour les pavillons. Soixante ans plus tard c'est toujours la même chose, le rêve français c'est toujours la même villa. Et je ne leur en veux pas.

En opposition à l'urbanisme des grands ensembles on peut penser à plusieurs phénomènes. 

* Il y a d'abord la puissance de l'initiative privée, dans les zones industrielles. Les maisons des mines par exemple sont des quartiers vivables, vecteurs de progrès et nés de l'initiative des industriels. Idem pour les Cités Jardins londonniennes.

* Il y a aussi les bienfaits de l'urbanisme selon Haussmann ou Cerda, qui finalement ont créé des plans directeurs pour développer harmonieusement des villes plutôt que de créer en partant de zero.

Et c'est exactement ce qui a manqué en 60 ans de développement de banlieues pavillonaires: des schémas, des concepts directeurs à même de recréer des circulations (comme moi tu dois vomir sur les impasses) tout en limitant les couts d'infrastructure et en permettant une éventuelle densification.

Will they? That's quite a leap. You view it just as a quantitive difference, but is it? Less gifted children don't only suffer from a lesser ability, they also suffer from the difference in perception with the main body of society. The latter disadvantage applies just as well to the more gifted children.

In addition, it's not uncommon either to have a combination of talents and disadvantages, take for example Asperger's syndrome: cognitively strong but socially inept. They would score above average on the usual performance tests, and therefore be ignored by programs for the challenged. But it happens often enough that these people fail to realize their potential when more is asked of their social skills in their later education or career.

Hey, I'm all for that. Different countries have instituted very different such programs, and to my knowledge none have gotten impressive results at all. But I think you are having trouble understanding the reasoning behind needing evidence. When you're in charge of spending money to make the most out of it, you don't just give it to the guy promising his system will make kids smarter. You ask him for proof. It's as simple as that. Research is not banned from this perspective (and it isn't in reality); plenty of pilot programs have and continue to be made to research on the matter. 

I myself find the premise a little idealistic (that special programs would make gifted kids into adult geniuses and hyperachievers, when the evidence from developmental psychology points to most gifted children being simply cognitively mature for their age, rather than true geniuses that'll continue to be so into adulthood), but I'm not one to argue against evidence if shown to me.

true,Carnelov,null,null,"Lorsqu'on parle de jalousie ou de vengeance pour expliquer les propos de quelqu'un sans rien savoir de lui, juste pour expliquer le fond de son propos, on se terre dans l'ad hominem.

Sinon, il y a d'autres façons de voir que le plan quinquennal d'un côté, et les théories économiques ""libérales"" (je ne sais pas ce qu'il met derrière). D'ailleurs, ce monsieur est docteur en sociologie à Paris VIII, mais a été formé à Paris VII. Sociologie. Pas économie. J'ignore même s'il a été formé plus de quelques heures aux sciences économiques.

A noter également que Paris VIII ne se vante pas de former la future élite française. On peut donc raisonnablement penser que votre remarque est plutôt à côté de la plaque. Pourquoi toujours se fonder sur ce genre de comparaisons ?

D'ailleurs, l'enseignement n'est généralement ni meilleur ni moins bien ; il est par contre plus ou moins valorisé, et structurellement différent. La présence de Monti dans un amphi doit avoir une valeur pédagogique approchant le néant. Et une bonne partie des intervenants de Science Po n'ont même pas besoin d'être docteur. C'est d'ailleurs ce que dénonce l'auteur de cet article sans trop l'expliquer ou aller dans le détail : la cooptation et les bonnes relations permettent d'obtenir un poste d'enseignant. Dans une faculté ""ordinaire"", cet effet est largement amoindri même si beaucoup se plaignent des ""effets de réseaux"". Oui : techniquement, le recrutement d'un maître de conf' à la fac est bien plus élitiste et écrème bien plus que Science Po (qui, inversement, écrème plus ses étudiants potentiels qu'à la fac).

Mais voilà, tout cela pour dire que la qualité des interventions ou de l'enseignement, c'est très très très relatif. Si je veux être formé avec un bon encadrement, par des professeurs motivés et tous hautement diplômés, je pense qu'il faut clairement éviter Paris (ses facs, ses écoles). Je connais de petites facultés de province où le taux d'encadrement ferait pâlir d'envie n'importe quelle école, et où une bonne partie des professeurs est terriblement motivée. 

Nous nous situons encore sur la ligne de rupture entre le rôle ""d'écrémage"" d'une institution comme Science Po, très représentative du système éducatif français, dont le but est de trier puis de faire de l'or avec de l'or (socialement parlant, hein) et celui d'élévation réel des élèves à travers l'éducation reçue (où on est déjà plus dans le défi d'apporter une véritable valeur ajoutée à l'enseignement).

Autre point rigolo : là où l'élite anglo-saxonne, par exemple, sort de facultés dispensant des cours gratuitement sur Internet (l'excellence se fait par le produit, le rendu, pas nécessairement le paraître et les collaborations), plus on monte dans la hiérarchie des écoles/facultés françaises, plus l'enseignement y est fermé et protégé dans une tour d'ivoire. Et c'est bien normal : au final, à l'exception de l'ENS (qui s'ouvre peu à peu à la société civile, malgré leur réputation d'autistes), une grande majorité des écoles ""d'élite"" françaises partent du principe de la sur-sélection, plutôt que de dispenser une formation de très très haut niveau. Voilà pourquoi les universités américaines ""bradent"" leurs diplômes ou des qualifications, y compris gratuitement, sur Internet (voir Coursera par exemple). Leur objectif est l'éducation et le business.

But that's not the point... even if you would successfully argue that it's essentialy the same, the problem for your position is that the ""Palestinian radicals use civilians/civilian property as human shields"" argument comes up when people refer to the rather drastic differences in casualties.

In other words, in the end, that argument is probably not going to help the position you seem to hold much... assuming both sides don't really separate between military targets and civilian targets (for the argument sake, let's say that's the case), it then becomes simply a matter of a better military that Palestinian casualties are much higher.

Which I am, ultimately, okay with as an explanation. I know Israel claims they take utmost care only to hit militants, but that's possibly mainly a spin. But if we take that for granted, then I also fail to be impressed when another one of those ""Look at the much higher casualties the poor Palestinians suffer"" posts come up (just a week or two ago a ""Israel/Palestine scoreboard"" was big on r/worldpolitics), since I will then blame any difference in casualty numbers on military tactics, equipment and training.
