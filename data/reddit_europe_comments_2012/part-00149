&gt; This multi-award-winning film has been financed by contributions from a number of European governments and the European Economic Community. Shot in fifteen countries in western and eastern Europe, it touches upon all aspects of conservation, including lost treasures, restoration, new uses for old buildings and new construction, both harmonious and incongruous, traffic (congestion, parking and pedestrian areas), the pressures of tourism, unsightly advertising and other 'eyesores,' technical and financial problems, and the activities of local authorities and conservation societies.

&gt; '...a beautiful film, directed and edited with great flair and skill. From its opening montage of glories that have survived the assaults of war, decades of neglect and the depredations of developers, to its end above the water of threatened Venice, the changes of pace and the violence of contrasts keep your eyes very wide open. Teachers of history, social studies, liberal studies and current affairs will find obvious uses for the film. Europa Nostra is a powerful indictment of those whose judgment of our architectural inheritance is determined by whether they will make money faster by knocking it down rather than allowing it to stand for our pleasure. The quality of our lives is our responsibility - and that is a political and moral lesson every school should teach. Europa Nostra is as good an aid as you will get for putting it across.' *Times Educational Supplement, London*

In fact, I'm not in favour of independence for Catalonia. I would be happier to go on living in Spain. But I think the points you make don't make a lot of sense.

&gt; 
Catalonia was never an independent country. It first belonged to the Kingdom of Aragon and then to Spain.    
 the area was unified with Spain via an ancient marriage between a Spanish king and queen.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau made an excellent point on this subject when he said that the dead should not govern the living. You're absolutely right that Catalonia was a part of Aragon before the union of Ferdinand and Isabella made it a part of Spain. But it is ridiculous to say that the will of a 15th-century king should dictate the destiny of a 21st-century person. If the people of Catalonia want to rule themselves, the government of Spain has no legitimacy in denying them that right.

&gt; They (Barcelona) has fought to defend Spanish freedom in the past.

Yes, during the Civil War. And after they lost that war, they were forced to live for 36 years under a fascist government which hated Catalan culture and made speaking the Catalan language a crime. Surely it's fairly easy to understand why Catalans might mistrust rule from outside after an experience like that?

[Edit: KabkaCaana points out that speaking Catalan wasn't treated as a crime, only writing Catalan in official documents and giving children Catalan names.]

&gt; Spanish was the primary language in Catalonia till the late 14th century.

This is simply not true. Spanish has been used in Catalonia, in one way or another, through most of its history, but Catalan has always had a presence ever since Spanish and Catalan first diverged as different dialects of Latin.

&gt; Catalonia has the largest GDP debt of Spain due to their regional government's overspending. Yet they demand 5 billion euros from Spain instead of balancing their budget. That is their own problem.

This is a fair point, but it doesn't show the whole picture. Catalonia doesn't always get as much public spending going in as tax going out. I don't think it would improve Catalonia's economy to separate from Spain. At the same time, there are economic arguments which suggest that it would be a good idea. It's hard to tell.

&gt; A low turnout for a referendum is not credible at all.

The referendum hasn't been held yet, so you have no way of knowing what the turnout will be, if indeed the referendum is ever held.

&gt; The Spanish constitution states that Spain is inseparable. So any referendum or attempt to break away is invalid and a violation of the Spanish Consitution Article 155. All traitors will taken to court and prosecuted as criminals. Read Articles 544 to 589 of the Spanish Criminal Code.

The Spanish constitution was written by human beings. It's not an inviolable holy text. If the people of today decide that they want to do things differently from what the Spanish Constitution dictates, then it is not within the power of the people of 1978 to deny them that right.

&gt; All Catalans are Spanish.

According to your opinion - and I see no good reason why Catalan people should use your opinion, instead of their own, to define their feelings about their national identity.

&gt; There can be no such ""independence"" from a region that has always been a part of Spain.

I expect that something similar has been said about every modern independent nation right before it became independent for the first time.

&gt;Problems:
The Local Government in Cataluña they deliberately barely teach Spanish in schools.

As it happens, I work in the Catalan education system, and so I can tell you first-hand that this is not even partially true. Spanish is very well-taught in Catalan schools, and Catalan students do as well as students from the rest of Spain on Spanish language exams. 

&gt; The Local Government in Cataluña uses ultra ""nationalism"" such as in football clubs to blame the rest of Spain for their own problems.

There is at least one football club that is ultra-nationalist, and I agree with you that it's as annoying as hell - I wish FC Barça would stay out of politics and concentrate on football. But the local government has no control over what FC Barça do. If Barça decide to be very independentist, they have the option (as a private organisation) to do that, if they want to.

&gt; The Cataluñan government continues to overspend and increase their debt.

I don't like the Catalan government either, so I won't argue with you about how stupid their economic policies are.

&gt; Currently there is a lack of integration of Catalunia with the rest of Spain.

Is integration really the best thing possible? Yes, there should of course be acceptance between different cultures, but surely there's something good about having different cultures in different places. Surely we don't want culture to be the same everywhere?

En plus il y a beaucoup d'étrangers qui apporte pas mal de différence, et ils ne viennent pas forcément d'écoles prestigieuses (il est plus facile de venir à SCPO de l'étranger).  Aujourd'hui quand je vais à des réunions d'anciens, soit 1-2 fois pas an, je trouve certes une majorité d'avocats ou de consultants mais aussi pas mal de profils atypiques. On n'a pas l'impression d'être entre cousins consanguins. 

Un prof de SCPO m'a dit un jour que l'école est plus ouverte que beaucoup de ses élèves, ça me semble assez vrai.

Ceci dit, je suis passé par l'admission parallèle, concours après bac+3, et c'est un approche assez différente que l'entrée après le bac. Les post-bacheliers étaient souvent de grosses brutes de travail avec une optique concours et un déficit (variable) de maturité. Les deux populations se mélangeaient d'ailleurs assez peu. 

De mon expérience, ceux qui allaient à l'ENA étaient souvent des étudiant entré juste après le avec un coté geek à grosse lunettes et des tics de partout. Je caricature, mais il m'a souvent semblé qu'ils étaient irréprochables sur le plan technique mais à coté de la plaque pour comprendre la vie des gens du commun des mortels. Un peu inquiétant quand on parle de politique publique. 

Encore une fois, ce n'est que mon point de vue, et je ne suis pas forcément représentatif mais à mes yeux, SCPO est une école assez ouverte avec une démographie moins biaisée qu'on ne l'imagine.

Beaucoup de gestes, un ton résolument humoristique... Sylvain explique au passage comment il fait sa publicité et comprend qu'il fait peur aux gens. Un peu d'hésitation... On apprend que même le chat n'est pas venu.

03:15 : Comme un blocage... Pendant 30 secondes, Sylvain se demande s'il doit bien continuer sa soirée, si sa copine a inventé son histoire de mal de tête pour ne pas avoir à venir, si le gaz est bien fermé.

03:55 : ""Moins de personnes, plus de liberté !"" Suivi d'un rire sardonique exprimant bien la folie douce de Sylvain.

07:56 : Sylvain coupe le son pour dire ""J'espère que vous avez passé une bonne semaine"", puis le remet et jette le micro comme un vulgaire bout de papier...

8:25 : Sylvain décide de raconter une blague. Sa pire de tous les temps.

11:09 : Pendant que la musique joue, Sylvain décide de dessiner une bite sur son ordinateur. Après, il s'amuse avec sa bite... Enfin, celle qu'il a dessinée.

13:12 : Nouveau rire sardonique.

14:28 : Sylvain a un petit message à faire passer. De la part d'une Rançaise à un Rançais qui se reconnaitra... Amorce sur le générique des Snorkies, avec petite danse puis fond sifflé de Sylvain. Enchaînement sur une vidéo des Beatles. Sylvain affiche des cœurs à la fin et ponctue d'un ""Oh, c'est pas mignon, ça ? Et oui, c'est la vie, c'est comme ça."" Il est clair qu'Orvandil et MonsieurYaourt se font passer des messages par l'intermédiaire de Sylvain. Ah ben bravo.

22:55 : À ta santé, Sylvain.

25:10 : ""C'est clairement du foutage de gueule ! C'est du foutage de gueule !""

29:18 : ""Merci d'être venus !""

33:34 : ""Je pense que j'ai perdu une partie de mon auditoire."" Ben oui, hein, vu qu'il n'y avait déjà personne dans la salle...

35:32 : Sylvain investit le danse-plancher. Enfin... Il tourne en rond devant l'écran en dodelinant, quoi.

35:48 : Sylvain décide de faire du lèvresynchro sur la  chanson en cours. Magnifique. Un ""malfreur"" dans l'âme. Ou alors il parle à la caméra mais sans avoir mis le micro dans le mix, c'est pas facile à dire...

38:22 : Sylvain profite de sa solitude pour se lancer dans un karaoké sur la Ballade des Gens Heureux. Hum. Mauvaise idée. Ne pas louper le moment où la main de Sylvain pointe les syllabes à chanter. Commentaire en cours de chanson ""C'est pathétique ! Ha ha ha !"" En effet.

43:50 : Sylvain passe à nouveau [la danse de David Brent extraite de The Office](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQXy72PByQU)...

44:52 : Sylvain s'énerve tout seul.

47:06 : Conclusion d'une soirée magistrale, cette fois ce sont bien les bananes qui ont deux fins et plus les saucisses. Sylvain met en garde contre les gens comme lui et demande à nouveau la libération de Carthage. ""AU R'VOIR !""

First, ""North"" and ""south"" cover very diverse cultural regions.

The most widespread and simplistic way to identify North ou South of France is to look at regions that in ancient times spoke ""langue d'Oc"" (souh) or ""Langue d'Oil"" (north).

Most people will tell you that norherners are sterner, work-oriented, whereas people of the south are easygoing, laid back...

This is oversimplistic if not plain wrong. North of France has been historically Catholic, and the South more Protestant. So long for the work culture...

For example when the Sarkozy government kicked out Romanian gypsies, the EU human rights court sent France a warning. 

Also when France threatened to close its borders with Italy after the Arab Revolutions (all the Tunisians took boats to Italy, but prefered living in France than Italy), the EU sent them a warning aswell. So member countries cant just do whatever they want.

- The Franc is currently pegged to the Euro at [1.20](http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=EUR&amp;to=CHF). So the Swiss Central Bank is buying Euro to keep the change stable.

&gt;**2000, Dezember: SEK Köln**

&gt;Nachdem ihn sein Nachbar wegen 
Waffenbesitzes  angezeigt  hatte, 
wird  ein  48-jähriger  Fliesenleger 
von  einem  SEK  überwältigt  und 
schwer verletzt. Die anschließende 
Durchsuchung  endet  ergebnislos. Im Nachhinein wird bekannt, 
dass der Nachbar, der ihn anzeigte 
(ein  Polizist)  dies  nur  auf  Basis 
von  Gerüchten  tat.  Die  Staatsanwaltschaft  hinterfragte  nichts 
davon,  sie  ordnete  stattdessen 
eine  Durchsuchung  durch  das 
SEK an. Damit nicht genug: Der 
Fliesenleger ist in Folge des brutalen SEK-Einsatzes zu 80% schwergeschädigt und damit berufsunfähig. Er erstattet Anzeige, doch 
wie  zu  erwarten  will  keiner  der 
beteiligten SEK-Angehörigen eine 
überzogene  Gewaltanwendung 
gesehen  haben.  Die  Staatsanwaltschaft stellt das Verfahren 
gegen die Beamt_innen ein.

&gt;**2004, Juni: SEK Köln**

&gt;Nachdem  es  über  Jahre  in 
einem Kölner SEK-Zug zu „einer 
Häufung  von  Merkwürdigkeiten“ 
gekommen  war,  ermittelt  die 
Staatsanwaltschaft gegen 7 SEK-
Angehörige und ihren Vorgesetzten. Diebstahl und Verstoß gegen 
das  Betäubungsmittelgesetz  lauten nur zwei der Vorwürfe, Details 
wollen die Behörden nicht nennen.
Trotzdem  wird  bekannt,  dass  in 
der  Einheit  Ausrüstungsgegenstände gestohlen wurden, mehrere
Beamt_innen sollen sich durch den 
Schmuggel von Rauschgift einen 
Nebenerwerb  geschaffen 
haben,  außerdem  wurden  auf 
einer  internen  Feier  offenkundig
THC-Plätzchen  konsumiert.  Die 
restlichen  Vorwürfe  wiegen  weit 
schwerer:  Fahrlässige  Tötung,
Körperverletzung  im  Amt  und 
Strafvereitelung. Untersucht wird 
u.a.  ein  SEK-Einsatz  aus  dem 
Jahr  2001,  bei  dem  ein  Sportschütze  unter  ungeklärten 
Umständen zu Tode kam. Das SEK 
gab damals einen Suizid an, drei 
Jahre  später  ist  es  fraglich,  ob 
der tödliche Schuss nicht aus der 
Dienstwaffe eines SEK-Bullen abgegeben wurde. Außerdem kam im 
Jahr 2004 ein Mitglied der Einheit 
während einer Übung ums Leben: 
Von den Kolleg_innen „aus Versehen“ erschossen. Der Kommandoführer der Einheit soll bei diesen und  anderen  Einsätzen  in  der 
Nachbereitung  dafür  gesorgt 
haben,  dass  die  Beamt_innen 
ihre  Aussagen  untereinander 
absprechen  und  damit  zur 
Vertuschung  beigetragen  haben.
Offenbar  mit  Erfolg,  denn  die 
Staatsanwaltschaft  stellt  die 
Ermittlungen im August 2005 ein.


&gt;**2004, Dezember: SEK Leipzig**

&gt;Eine  SEK-Einheit  dringt 
schießend in die Wohnung eines 
Verdächtigen ein, durchlöchert die 
Einrichtung, fesselt ihn und seine 
Lebensgefährtin,  durchsucht  die 
Wohnung  und  erschießt  dabei 
vorsorglich die beiden Hunde des 
Paares.  Erst  nach  einer  halben 
Stunde  stellen  sie  fest,  dass 
der  „Verdächtige“  ein  Kollege 
ist  und  sie  sich  in  der  falschen 
Wohnung  beinden.  Der  Innenminister  räumt  den  Irrtum  ein, 
sieht jedoch keinen Anlass, an der 
Verhältnismäßigkeit zu zweifeln.

&gt;**2005, April: SEK Berlin**

&gt;Mitten  in  der  Nacht  dringt  ein 
SEK  in  die  elterliche  Wohnung
eines  17-jährigen  ein.  Er 
wird  des  bewaffneten  Raubes 
verdächtigt.  Als  das  SEK  sein 
Zimmer  erreicht,  liegt  der 
Verdächtige  schlafend  im 
Bett.  Im  Halbdunklen  verliert
er  einen  Zahn,  erleidet 
zahlreiche  Hämatome,  ein  kilo-
schweres  Schutzschild  touchiert 
sein Schlüsselbein und hinterlässt 
eine wuchtige Einkerbung in der 
Wand hinter dem Bett. Dann liegt 
er  mit  angelegten  Handfesseln 
auf dem Boden, blutet und wird 
mehrmals ohnmächtig. Die Eltern 
werden derweil mit vorgehaltener 
Waffe in Schach gehalten. Auf die 
Frage  nach  dem  Grund  für  den 
Einsatz antworten die Polizist_innen sinngemäß: „Erst die Schläge, 
dann die Antwort.“ Auf der Wache 
folgt eine Gegenüberstellung, die 
den  17-jährigen  entlastet.  Noch 
immer blutend, begibt er sich ins 
Krankenhaus, die Ärzte befürchten 
einen  Schädelbasisbruch.  Er 
erstattet Anzeige wegen Schwerer
Körperverletzung.  2006  wird 
das  Verfahren  eingestellt,  eine 
Revision  abgelehnt.  Aussage 
gegen  Aussage,  laut  Staats-
anwaltschaft. Daran ändert auch 
nichts,  dass  die  Beamt_innen 
offensichtlich  lügen.  Zwei  sagen 
aus,  der  Verdächtige  sei  ihnen 
im Flur entgegen gekommen und 
gegen das Schutzschild gelaufen, 
wobei  er  sich  die  Verletzungen 
zugezogen  hätte.  Der  Rest  gibt 
an, er habe im Bett gelegen, sei 
jedoch nicht misshandelt worden. 
Blutspuren im Bett und die Kerbe 
an der Wand sprechen für sich.

&gt;**2005,  April:  SEK  aus  Berlin**
 
&gt;Brandenburg, Niedersachsen
Da sich unter den rund 580 Gästen 
einer Großraumdisko „hochgradig 
gewaltbereite Personen“ aus dem 
Hooliganspektrum befinden sollen, 
die  Straftaten  planten,  stürmen 
rund 100 SEK-Bullen aus Berlin, 
Brandenburg  und  Niedersachsen 
zur „Gefahrenabwehr“ das Lokal: 
„Alles auf den Boden ihr Fotzen!“ 
Wer nicht augenblicklich liegt, wird 
mit Schlagstock- und Fausthieben 
nieder gestreckt. In Folge des Zugriffs  liegen  die  Discobesucher_innen  noch  stundenlang  mit 
Kabelbindern  gefesselt  auf  dem 
Bauch zwischen Glassplittern und 
Blutlachen. Viele der z.T. schwer 
verletzten  Menschen  berichten 
außerdem,  dass  es  derweil  immer  wieder  zu  Beleidigungen, 
Misshandlungen und Demütigungen  gekommen  sei.  So  wurden 
Gefangene am Boden liegend getreten, andere mussten ihre Not-
durft in einem Eimer hinter dem 
Tresen  verrichten.  Die  Berliner 
Polizei  beschlagnahmt  sämtliche 
Aufnahmen  der  Disko-Überwachungskameras und veröffentlicht 
anschließend  Pressemitteilungen, 
in denen sie behauptet, es habe 
in der Disko massive Widerstandshandlungen  gegeben,  außerdem 
habe man es mit einem „kampfsporterfahrenen“  Gegenüber  zu 
tun  gehabt.  Mit  Bierkrügen  und 
Barhockern  seien  die  Elitepolizist_innen attackiert worden und 
generell gelte nach Aussage des 
eingesetzten SEK-Führers: „Wenn 
ein Kampfsportler mit einem Bier-
glas da steht, schlagen wir es ihm 
aus der Hand, bevor er wirft.“ In-
teressante Aussage, die ebenfalls 
verprügelten Journalist_innen sahen das anders. Nach einer Woche 
rudert die Polizei zurück und „korrigiert“ ihre Darstellung. Es habe 
nun  doch  keine  Widerstände 
gegeben. Dass Einsatzleiter, SEK-Führer und Pressestelle zuvor andere „Sachverhalte“ kommuniziert 
hatten, sei Produkt von „Fehlinterpretationen“  und  „Missverständnissen“ gewesen. Ein Eingeständnis  eines  Fehlverhaltens  der eingesetzten SEK-Bullen wird mit 
Hinweis auf die laufenden Ermittlungen, die erst abzuwarten seien, 
umgangen. Ende 2006 Stellt die Staatsanwaltschaft  die  Ermittlungen schließlich ein, da kein_e einzige_r der vermummten SEK-
Beamt_innen identiiziert werden konnte.

&gt;**2006, Dezember: SEK Köln**

&gt;Ein  eingetragener  Sportschütze 
soll seinen Nachbarn im Streit gedroht haben. Weil er über Zugang 
zu Schusswaffen verfügt, wird das SEK alarmiert. Gewaltsam dringen 
die SEK-Bullen in die Wohnung des vermeintlichen  „Waffennarren“
ein.  Dumm  nur,  dass  sich  die „Elitepolizsten“  in  der  Wohnung
geirrt  und  die  falsche  Tür  eingetreten haben. 

&gt;**2008, April: div. SEK und GSG9**

&gt;Aufgeflogen! SEK goes Schurkenstaat: Sieben SEK-Bullen aus NRW 
(Bielefeld,  Essen,  Köln)  werden intern  versetzt,  nachdem  nicht 
genehmigte  Nebentätigkeiten bekannt  wurden.  In  den  Jahren
2005  bis  2007  waren  sie zusammen  mit  Angehörigen weiterer  bundesdeutscher  SEKs, der GSG9 und Bundeswehr nach Tripolis  gereist,  um  libysche „Sicherheitskräfte“  zu  trainieren.
Ein  SEK-Bulle  bekam  dafür  von seiner  Dienststelle  6  Monate 
Urlaub,  ein  anderer  ließ  sich für  die  Zeit  krank  schreiben. 
Bei  den  mit  bis  zu  50000  Euro dotierten  Lehrgängen,  wurden 
zudem  Dienstgeheimnisse  weiter gegeben.  Weil  dies  aber  keinem 
konkreten  Bullen  mehr  nachzuweisen  war,  stellt  die  Staats-
anwaltschaft die Ermittlungen im Februar 2009 ein.

&gt;**2008, Juni: SEK Potsdam**

&gt;Während  eines  Staatsbesuchs des scheidenden US-Präsidenten,
schießt  sich  ein  brandenburgischer  SEK-Bulle  mit  seiner Dienstwaffe  in  die  Hand  und versetzt den Secret Service damit

What do you mean with that? One couldn't observe the Russian middle class, or the inhabitants of the Roman empire? 

&gt;That comparison is made all the time with Greece, even by the author of this article I believe.

Yes, and that is much more valid than the comparison to Weimar.

&gt;This article does not imply this, and neither do I argue that at all.

So, if there are such striking similarities to Weimar, could you please tell me where these phenomenons are:

* Article 48

* Recently lost World War

* Versaille treaty

* Forbidden to have an army of a certain limit and de-militarized zones

* One year old democracy

* Russian revolution and the read threat

* Proportional representation without limits

* Stab in the back legend

* Different sorts of attemt to seize power

and so on, etc...

&gt;What a strange thing to say. Of course you don't have to make the comparison, but maybe there is something to be learned from doing so? 

Well, of course one doesn't *have* too, one doesn't have to do anything, but there should be something to compare at least. The author has cherry picked one single thing, that the author thinks is comparable to the Weimar republic. This, does not however in any way make the comparison relevant or interesting. I can take one thing from the US of today and compare it to the Spanish Civil War, doesn't mean that my comparison is relevant or interesting. Or, why not compare the situation in Europe today to the 30 - year war, I can find a lot of liknesses there too.......

I admit that with some menial work you can earn substantially more in Germany than you ever could in Romania but things aren't THAT bad around here.  




&gt;""wretched conditions and bleak prospects""  



Their in that situation because they skip school and don't work. I personally wouldn't care about Gypsies if I knew they would become or at least try to become productive members of society. The hate isn't about race or ethnicity. The hate is more similar to what Westerners feel about homeless bums or free loaders. It's about their position in society in the negative effects on it.  

Education is free (yes we even have scholarship specifically for Gypsies at universities) and they get some money/food thanks to social aids (which of course is paid by those who pay taxes). Even if you live in squalor you can send your children to school so they become educated which will give them the ability to find a job. I'm not saying that they will become rich, but in a generation it would be possible to break out of the ""wretched conditions"". (a job is enough for you to rent an apartment and pay bills/food, except you have to keep that apartment clean if you don't want it to turn into the crap from where you escaped from)  

If learning isn't your thing, then ok, don't, but then get off your ass and earn your bread through physical labour if that's what it will take. (i.e. what the family in the article are trying to do) As a current example I'd just like to point out [Oláh Gergő](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDqjG2pz0Mw) who is currently competing in the Hungarian X-Factor. He didn't have a high paying job, he was a public worker, maximum they can earn is [47k Forints, maybe something more because if you children you have to pay marginally lower taxes](http://nol.hu/belfold/egy_kozmunkas_havi_122_ezerbe_kerul) and he is smart enough to realise that he needs to provide for his family will work his ass off doing what he can.

But for most it's easier to make 3+ kids, take up the aid and send them out the entrances of a hypermarkets to beg or take the change out of the push baskets (to be fair at least this isn't as annoying as outright begging, but hey **kids** are out there doing it) while they sit at home watching TV because they will sure as fuck pay for [satellite TV](http://www.poze-haioase.ro/pozehaioase.php?id=72]. (I can even take a picture out of my own home town if you want)

true,customs,null,null,"Hi! what do you want to learn more about? the format, or individual teams, or what?

the format is quite simple, and i imagine comparable to most other leagues. 

there's 20 teams. top 3 at the end of the regular season go to champions league, fourth goes to europa. the bottom three go to ligue 2. (and the top three from ligue 2 come to L1)

each team plays all the others twice (home and away). 

during the year, there's two playoffs, for the Coupe de France (more than 7000 clubs participate, amateurs welcome) and the Coupe de la Ligue (professional clubs -mostly L1 and L2-).

the winners of the coupe de france and coupe de la ligue go to the europa cup. 

before the beginning of the season, the winners of last year's regular season and coupe de france play a game called the trophée des champions, and the winner gets a nice little trophy that no one cares about.

as someone who has been a PSG fan their whole life, obviously i would recommend becoming a PSG fan. the PSG has a relatively short history, but it's been quite a ride. it has also been a troubled history in many ways, but i think the good certainly outweighs the bad. 

i don't know all that much about other clubs, but if you'd like to learn more about the PSG, i'd be happy to try to answer questions.

what i will say about montpellier is that i have been extremely impressed with their fans. the montpellier fans i've met have been the nicest, most open fans i've dealt with. generally, being a PSG fan is a non-starter, but the montpellier fans i talked to were eager to hear my thoughts and share theirs. they were level headed, and knowledgeable, and i had a fantastic time! i even got a free beer! :)

so that's definitely a good team to follow. someone here posted this video that gives a pretty cool impression of what it's like in montpellier pre-game

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDK9Oq5ONQE&amp;feature=relmfu

the only beef i have with montpellier is their extremely annoying/dickish president, Louis Nicollin. he just doesn't know how to shut his trap, and likes to trash talk a lot. he also whines every time montpellier loses a big game. basically, his behavior is unbecoming of a club such a montpellier, but otherwise, the club is a great one. only other issue is relatively low attendance reccord, but that's on the upswing now that they're back in L1 and doing well. montpellier is a fantastic town too. 

anyway, that was totally unhelpful, but i wanted to say that it's great that you are going to start following L1. it's a great league, with lots of great players. some people complain that it's too defensive, but i kind of prefer that style. it's also quite physical compared to other leagues. i may be wrong, but i've always had the impression that ligue 1 was more even that most other leagues. there's no madrid or barca to roll over the rest league. (this may have changed with psg's new additions). 

either way, i hope you enjoy, and don't hesitate to ask more questions.",0,1351443197,null,0,false,0,c6sxog6,t3_127pa2,t1_c6sxog6,t3_127pa2,null,1430259748,6,false,Ligue1,t5_2sc3j,6

- *""We would have to conform to a lot EU regulations if we want to trade with them""*...  that applies to every single country the UK wants to trade with.  Trade within the US and you have to meet US regulations, China China's,  Russia Russia's, India India's.  Yes, if someone wanted to sell their product or service in Europe they'd have to meet their regulations.  The obvious retort is, 'So?'

- *""Our farmers have to compete with farmers from the rest of the EU.  If they subside their farmers, we have to subsidise their farmers or let them go broke.""*... If the UK is a net contributor to the CAP but it is geared for continental sized small holdings and not the typical UK farm, the UK could not only tailor its subsidies to make them *more* efficient, they could scale them *up* and still spend a lot *less* than what they do now.  It's not UK farmers that would hurt, they'd be considerably better off all things considered, it'd be EU farms that would have to look on.   

-  *""If the EU decided they were not interested in free trade any more that would have a huge effect on our exports""*...first of all, why would they, and second of all, Switzerland made individual trade agreements with individual EU members; even if the EU decided to shoo UK contributions and trade through the EEA, which it's in no real position to do, by the time it came to pass the UK would simply have individual trade agreements in place.  It's not like a referendum will be held on a Monday and the UK will leave on the Tuesday.

- *""At the moment we have influence within the EU. If would be idiotic to give that up""*...saying something is idiotic doesn't make it so without backing it up.  Wait until Lisbon Treaty voting reform kicks in in 2013 and the European elections in 2014 and that representation is winnowed, and then explain how that influence effectively represents UK interests.  Even UK voting as it exists and as it is represented gives more strength to the Lib Dem vote first, then Labour, and only then the Conservatives which is by far the most popular UK opinion on Europe.

He claims that there is an organised plan by the government to silence him. Then, he makes parallels with the ""[Ohi day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochi_Day)"" (national celebration/holiday thing), implying that the methods employed by the government are fascist. 

He goes on to deny the allegations that him releasing the list goes against the protection of private information. His argument is that only the names were published and not the bank account details. He also mentions that banking is a public matter and not private information (note: [Here's an analysis by a Greek lawyer on the matter](http://elawyer.blogspot.nl/2012/10/h.html); Too Greek Didn't Read: it's debatable).

He then reviews the basics of the issue: The Greek government has had a list of possible tax-evaders for the past three years. He mentions that lists like this one have seen use in other countries, France and Germany among them. The list is then somehow supposed to be lost between the ministries. He says that this is a ridiculous and unbelievable excuse and sets a dangerous precedent which culminates with his persecution. He mentions that two political parties (Syriza and Independent Greeks) have characterised this incident as political persecution. 

He argues that he had to publish the list, not only because it is his responsibility as a journalist to reveal the truth, but because there is also a conspiracy that has been holding Greece hostage. He says that there are people who have been making a mockery out of Greek politics by keeping the list hidden and publishing other fake lists filled with politicians. The worst thing, he says, is that the ministers who are supposed to be public servants managed this list as if it was their private property.

He says that it is tragic that free press is persecuted in this day and age, it's also tragic that the government and justice system collaborate to attack free press. He mentions a few foreign news outlets (Le Monde, Liberations, Reuters) that frequently criticise Greece's record on respecting the freedom of press. 

He pleads that any person should understand that the list should have been made public, especially because the poor people of Greece suffer while the government does not even try to investigate the tax evasion allegations contained in the list. 

Finally, he mentions that he will go to the public prosecutor's office in the next morning to ask for an explanation for this arguably illegal action taken by the authorities against him. He mentions again that it is ""Ohi day"" and that he has nothing to add except that he must stand his ground and say ""No"" to these practices against the freedom of the press.

true,dearyleary,OL,Olympique Lyonnais,"Montpellier are really struggling this year (they're starting to round into form, but they have to make up 7 points just to make it to a Europa League spot), so if you want a team that will be playing in the Champions League on a semi-regular basis I'd be looking at the other Olympique (Lyon), Lille, Bordeaux, St. Etienne, or Toulouse (if you want to stay away from PSG and Marseille).  Last year I would have included Rennes, but their dynamic has become extremely dysfunctional and it doesn't look like they will be competing any time soon.

Really, Ligue1.com is one of the best league sites out there.  Lots of easily accessible stats, quick news updates, easily navigable site, I love it.  FFW is a great English site that's linked in the sidebar too they do a good weekly podcast that gives you the storylines of the league and Cup games, as well as some Ligue 2 news from time to time (Yay Monaco is looking like they'll be back in L1!).

One thing that separates France from other top leagues is that it's a very fluid league because they tend to sell players off to bigger clubs.  Lyon made their incredible run of seven L1 titles in a row by buying low and selling high.  So teams like Montpellier and Lille are having a tough time finding their feet this season by having to replace the goals from Giroud and Hazard respectively.

You're going to see a lot of young talent that's going to eventually move on to Spanish, German, and English teams and as a fan that can be difficult (as an OL fan it was hard to see Lloris go to Tottenham, *especially when they won't even play him!!!*).  But Paris' money might be the start of a reversal of that trend.  It's going to be hard to compete with Paris year in and year out if teams don't hold onto their prodigies for at least a year or two longer than they have in the past.

It's an exciting league to watch.  The table is normally really tight, lots of fun young players to watch, and because of the turnover of players it gives promoted teams a real shot at staying up and it forces teams to improve every year (Monaco dropping down to Ligue 2 is a perfect example of having to be a smart manager every year, and Auxerre a team with real history in L1 was relegated last year).  You can see real fluctuations from year to year (Montpellier was promoted for the 09-10 season and won a title within two years!).  

Games to look out for are any combination of the teams I labelled as contenders, but Marseille/Paris is always a great fixture, as is Lyon/Marseille and as a fan of OL I love the Rhone derby between Lyon and St. Etienne.  Since there are fewer teams that share cities they tend to have regional derbies: Rennes/Lorient tend to have some good matches, for instance.

The comparison is one of political culture. Shrinking political mainstream, hopelessness and antipathy to the rest of Europe over perceived imposition of hardship. Added to this is the economic contraction and unemployment, much more than just one factor.

You seem to assume that any historical comparison must be all or nothing, which is rubbish. You further assume that making historical comparisons means you are predicting the same outcome, which plainly is not the case.

Just because the comparison is not made on the parameters you choose to prescribe does not make it invalid. That said, Greek democracy is still fairly young, the parliament is run on PR (although I entirely reject that PR was a major factor in the troubles of Weimar).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;People write stuff down. I can't see any useful comparisons with either.

Exactly, they did that both in Rome and Russia.

&gt;Greek democracy is still fairly young, the parliament is run on PR 

German democracy was just a few years old, not nearly 40! 

I find it much more suitable to compare Estonia in the crises of 99 (8 year of democracy) to Weimar, or the crises of 2004-2007. 

&gt;Just because the comparison is not made on the parameters you choose to prescribe does not make it invalid.

Well, with that attitude, one can compare anything, since you seem to think that one can take just one thing. Tell me, is there anything you *can't compare*? That makes every comparison valid, or actually, unvalid.

If you read about the Weimar Republic, there is always a few things one comes back to, that were very significant, just like there are always a few key points when one talk about the French Revolution, Vietnam war etc. 

Hyperinflation is one. Greece do not have that - at all.  Another one is that it was a *very* young democracy, in a country that hadn't have that before (certainly not 40 years, think when the Germans had 40 years of that, you had West Germany in 1986, very, very stable ). Another thing is that one very, very recently lost a World War. That lead to a complete change in -well everything. No more Kaiser, a humiliating Versaille treaty with absurd payment demands, and of course, the ""stab- in the back"" legend, that was so damaging for the Weimar Republic. Have that recently happened to Greece, a humiliating war and treaty that I have missed? 

Another thing they had, which made the shaky democracy (one year old, not 38)even more unstable was the unlimied parlamentarism and article 48. Greece do not have that, do they? 

All this was *key* features of the Weimar Republic. Without them, the ""mood"", which seems so important to you, would have been *completely* different. Yet, you choose to ignore the key features, deaming them not important, saying that not all of the parameters have to be the same. Well, if you ignore all the key features, why not compare Greece to - is there anything we can't compare Greece to? You obviously do not care about key features, but ""perceived hardship"". Well, talking about that, why not make a parallell to 30- year war? Not that the key features are alike, but we have perceive hardship there? Or, Rome at the end, the dwindling middle class and their (not perceived I'd say) hardship. After all, we do not care about key feature do we?

If one ignores the key features, anything can be compared with anything, and it renders all comparisons useless. But, you are just ignoring that, I guess the key features from history are just to be ignored. 
Well, I can't force you to learn history and not ignore key features of course, but every historical  comparison you make will be useless if you just take one bit here, one bit there, ignoring the mostcruicial pieces.

&gt;Nothing until you introduced it in your last thread as a comparison.

I was illustrating that such schemes already exist. So are you saying that the current system is unacceptable as well? If so, what do you propose? Get rid of all social programs?

&gt;I can use the roads with my bike and car.

You use **all** the roads?  I doubt that. What about people who don't own a car? I don't have children. Does that mean that I can throw a fit because some people do get tax-funded child benefits? Your entire argument seems to be nothing more than the good old libertarian ""fuck you I got mine"" complaint. 

&gt;You are purposefully avoiding the point now.

Avoiding? I feel like I have addressed the same points several times now. We are arguing in a circle because you never seem to appriciate that citizens do, in fact, have privileges a foreigner doesn't. 

&gt;If I am funding said welfare program but not being able to benefit from it,yes I am saying it's not OK.

So you're not only opposed to the basic income guarantee but against **all** social programs. Why didn't you say so in the beginning? Germany is a welfare state and as long as a majority of people here want it to remain a welfare state, it's not gonna change. Deal with it. 

&gt;I have paid tens of thousand of Euros into the German system dear boy.

You paid *taxes*. That's money you weren't entitled to in the first place. You have a right only to your net income. So stop pretending that the state is somehow obliged to pander to your wishes just because you paid taxes. 

&gt;Can you tell me how I am not playing by the rules?

You want entitlements without meeting the requirements for said entitlements. 

&gt;I am guessing you are a student who has never worked and this topic is your token line at parties? 

It's obvious that you're trying to attack me personally now because you have no real arguments left. Your tone has become more and more aggressive and insulting throughout this conversation. Seriously, go back and look at your posts. A child could show better manners.

If you did have children would you expect to get it?

&gt;Avoiding? I feel like I have addressed the same points several times now. We are arguing in a circle because you never seem to appreciate that citizens do, in fact, have privileges a foreigner doesn't.

Can you tell me one  benefit a citizen can get that a normal resident cannot?

&gt;You want entitlements without meeting the requirements for said entitlements.

You want my taxes without giving me entitlement.

&gt;It's obvious that you're trying to attack me personally now because you have no real arguments left. Your tone has become more and more aggressive and insulting throughout this conversation. Seriously, go back and look at your posts. A child could show better manners. I have been very patient with you so far, but I'm not interested in a ""who can one-up the other in insults"" competition. So, unless you start acting like an adults again, I will probably ignore you from now on.

When you start earning money and paying taxes come back and we can have an ADULT debate. I asked if you were a student because I feel like people who haven't yet contributed tax into a system could hold such fundamentally naive views.

Good luck with the qualification.

&gt;that applies to every single country the UK wants to trade with. 

Yes and of course it would convenient for us if we could influece the regulations of all the other markets as well but of course we can't. I don't see why that's an argument for throwing away our influence in the EU.

Apart from that it's obviouly more important because the EU also represents a larger proportion of our trade.

&gt; Our farmers have to compete with farmers from the rest of the EU. If they subside their farmers, we have to subsidise their farmers or let them go broke....

I agree although with that. However, that wasn't the point I was trying to make. The UK generally favours free trade which would mean scrapping subsides or at least substantially reducing them. However by leaving the EU we give up any influence we have to do that. Inside the EU we can influence the CAP. Outside, in practice, we have to follow the general direction set by the rest of EU.

&gt; If the EU decided they were not interested in free trade any more that would have a huge effect on our exports

Switzerland makes bi-lateral trade agreements with the EU, but they are a bit of a joke. After the other 27 countries have furiously haggled over the regulations and coming to an agreement, they are not going to make substantial concessions for tiny little Switzerland. The EU have set up their regulations to disadvantage Swiss Cheeses producers and Swiss Banks, etc. and favour the interests of the current members.

I'm not really sure what you mean by getting by trade agreements in place. My point was a broader one. At the moment the UK is a counterweight to France which generally fundamentally distrusts free trade. If we leave the EU, France is likely to get far more of it's way. It may well put an end to the EEA which it tends to regards as leeching off the EU single marketing without fully contributing to the social costs.  We would be giving up the power to influence decisions which affect us profoundly.

&gt; Even UK voting as it exists and as it is represented gives more strength to the Lib Dem vote first, then Labour, and only then the Conservatives

The Conservatives only have themselves to blame for their lack of influence within the EU. They followed the same sort of faulty reasoning that Euroskeptics are using now to leave the EU.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt; I don't see why that's an argument for throwing away our influence in the EU.
 
Because the 'influence-weighing-scales' on being in-or-out heavily favour 'out'; and the pro-EU crowd must come up with another argument, when one tries to tally how Britain's influence tallies up in a bloc-voting 27 country union compared to getting back its right to not go through an EU trade commissioner, control of its fishing and agriculture, its seat back on the WTO,combined with the fact that the UK economy is by no means indicative of not only the North-South Europe divided but significantly different from Europe whole, the influence argument isn't a strong one for the pro-EU crowd.

&gt;he UK generally favours free trade which would mean scrapping subsides or at least substantially reducing them.

That's completely wrong, even with matters outside the EU the UK has a long history of providing subsidies.  So strong in fact that one of the more vocal grievances people have with Europe is that other European countries and companies even come to the UK to capitalise on the heavy subsidies they can't find elsewhere.  Windfarms for example.  Other recent UK subsidies on the UKs own initiative?  Nuclear fuel, a Green Investment Bank, and the newly named UK Space Agency.  The UK has a long history of providing subsidies, and in addition willingly funding organisations independent of the government.

That doesn't change that the UK could pay far less when it comes to subsidy, pay what they do more efficiently and still save money whereas the CAP would be a significant net contributor which it currently pays relatively little out to.

The UK wouldn't have to *""follow the general direction set by the rest of EU""* it would actually be setting the pace, and UK agriculture is far more efficient and industrialised than their EU counterparts - that's part of the problem why they receive such a raw deal at the moment.

&gt;After the other 27 countries have furiously haggled over the regulations and coming to an agreement, they are not going to make substantial concessions for tiny little Switzerland.

I don't get why this is used as an argument so much as it is.  If 26 countries come out with an agreement on the single market that applies to all, for the benefit of all, there's a solid chance it makes sense for number 27.  Now if I were a billionaire I would no longer stand in Tescoes wondering if I need sugar or how many teabags I have left or indeed if I should have gone to Sainsbury's - I'd have a butler, a chef and a housekeeper to worry about that.  I'd willingly defer a responsibility and spend my time on more pressing matters.

If the EU wants to spend time setting the park for the single market have at it, I'd gladly swap that chore for being able to have control of the judiciary, control of fishing, farming, trade agreements outside the EU which the UK has far better footing than anyone else within (whilst still being able to maintain EU trade), and to reclaim their seat at the WTO.

When all things are balanced there is an influence *deficit* being part of the EU for the UK, also for some other countries, but none more so than the UK, and they just happen to be amongst those that give the most.

&gt;I'm not really sure what you mean by getting by trade agreements in place. 

Even UKIP advocates negotiating trade agreements before actually leaving the EU.  There would be continuation of trade.  UK-EU trade would continue.  It's a given.  It's a given because it is everybody's interests.

&gt; If we leave the EU, France is likely to get far more of it's way.

Good luck to 'em.  If they are then other Europeans are backing them.  If the UK leaves that's the European Union's concern, wouldn't you say?

&gt; It may well put an end to the EEA which it tends to regards as leeching off the EU single marketing without fully contributing to the social costs. 

EEA members do fully contribute to the costs of a single market.  Norway's just had its contributions increased considerably from what they were but still a tiny fraction of the UK's expense, even when they're scaled up to account for the UK's larger GDP.

&gt;The Conservatives only have themselves to blame for their lack of influence within the EU. 

Woah.

Woah.

Woah.

The Conservatives happen to represent by far the main public sentiment.  This is the Conservative MEP elect mandate.  They're the only UK party that beats UKIP.  Don't get this the wrong way around.  It's not the Conservatives that have themselves to blame for actually representing the people on this.

Ever wondered why the accusation of anti-democracy is so often levelled at the pro-EU crowd?  It's commentary like THAT.

&gt;Instead of staying within the European People's Party and trying to influence it from within, against the wishes of most of their own MEPs they thought they would be better off to form their own group for some reason.

One of the few times they show some principles and you criticise them for holding themselves to them.  The EPP supported a federalised Europe.  The Conservative's position in there was untenable.  If the Conservatives had stayed in pro-Federal voting bloc, it already being decided that it was, there would have been pitchforks at dawn and it would have fuelled the otherwise ostracised marginal nationalist groups.

The majority of your argument has been about influence in the EU and yet you are now advocating that the Conservatives should have stayed in a voting bloc that supported a federal Europe.  You are not arguing for more UK influence any longer.

""(1) All Germans shall have the right to move freely throughout the

""(1) All Germans shall have the right freely to choose their occupation or profession, their place of work, and their place of training. The practice of an occupation or profession may be regulated by or pursuant to a law.""

And me too!

""(1) Men who have attained the age of eighteen may be required to serve in the Armed Forces, in the Federal Border Police, or in a civil defense organization.""

Not me PML!


""(2) Any person who, on grounds of conscience, refuses to render military service involving the use of arms may be required to perform alternative service. The duration of alternative service shall not exceed that of military service. Details shall be regulated by a law, which shall not interfere with the freedom to make a decision in accordance with the dictates of conscience, and which shall also provide for the possibility of alternative service not connected with units of the Armed Forces or of the Federal Border Police.""



Not me!

Wow these are really great benefits of being a German citizen!

This next one is particularly obscene, ""(4) If, during a state of defense, the need for civilian services in the civilian health system or in stationary military hospitals cannot be met on a voluntary basis, women between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five may be called upon to render such services by or pursuant to a law. Under no circumstances may they render service involving the use of arms.""

Not me! What a shame I don't have this BENEFIT.

""(1) No German may be deprived of his citizenship. Citizenship may be lost only pursuant to a law, and against the will of the person affected only if he does not become stateless as a result.

(2) No German may be extradited to a foreign country.""

Oh wow, what do I have to do to become a citizen, tell me, tell me, tell meeeeeeee.

















I can do all of that. I was speaking about welfare benefits. I am eligible for all the benefits that you are, and that is protected by European law.

First of all, it takes 5 years of a temporary residence in order to apply for a permanent residence (via work visa). With the change in govt, the laws have become extremely strict in allowing new immigrant workers. I am not sure off every detail, but you have to have a skill that doesn't exist in the EU.

If you come via marriage / family, this will be the easiest option. You have to first get your temporary residence. Then you live in Spain or at least one year. After that year you can apply for your permanent residence. 

For investments, I am not too sure. I know there are visas for opening a business - but there are many strict rules when it comes to owning your own business in Spain. I read an article from /r/es stating that it is easier to open a business in Zambia than Spain. I think the initial investment must be around 700,000€. 

I'm not sure of your age / education. If you have recently finished uni, you can go on a language exchange program. You must have an advanced level of Spanish to be considered for the program.

true,reductios,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;Because the influence scales on being in and out heavily favour out and the pro-EU crowd must come up with another argument 

A countries influence is related to the size of it's economy. It's wishful thinking on the part to think that UK would have more power on it's own would have more influence on it's own.


&gt;&gt;The UK generally favours free trade which would mean scrapping subsides or at least substantially reducing them.
&gt;That's completely wrong,  even with matters outside the EU the UK has a long history of providing subsidies.

This is a bizarre argument. You are saying that the UK is no more in favour of free trade than other countries in the EU like France so we can happily have there own way because they and not going to take the UK in a substantially way than we would have wanted them to go anyway?

Okay, I suppose we better have a look at the Index of Economic Freedom and see if you are right then ...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_Economic_Freedom


Nope, it looks like you were wrong. There are a few other countries in the EU that come with the UK in the top 30, but most of them don't. So there does seem to be a difference of attitude.


&gt;The UK wouldn't have to ""follow the general direction set by the rest of EU"" it would actually be setting the pace, and UK agriculture is far more efficient and industrialised than their EU counterparts - that's part of the problem why they receive such a raw deal at the moment.

Simply asserting that doesn't make it true. 

I've given you an argument that if the rest of the EU decides to subsidise it's farmers and we don't, our farmers will not be able to compete and will go bust. So we would have no option but to follow the general direction they as the much larger economy set. We've established that there is a difference in attitude to free trade but even there wasn't, we would still be giving our freedom to influence over the level of subsidies.


&gt;After the other 27 countries have furiously haggled over the regulations and coming to an agreement, they are not going to make substantial concessions for tiny little Switzerland.
I don't get why this is used as an argument so much as it is. If 26 countries come out with an agreement on the single market that applies to all, for the benefit of all, there's a solid chance it makes sense for number 27. Now if I were a billionaire I would no longer stand in Tescoes wondering if I need sugar or how many teabags I have left or indeed if I should have gone to Sainsbury's - I'd have a butler, a chef and a housekeeper to worry about that. I'd willingly defer a responsibility and spend my time on more pressing matters.
If the EU wants to spend time setting the park for the single market have at it, I'd gladly swap that chore for being able to have control of the judiciary, control of fishing, farming, trade agreements outside the EU which the UK has far better footing than anyone else within (whilst still being able to maintain EU trade), and to reclaim their seat at the WTO.

You were accusing pro-Europeans of being anti-democratic a second ago and now you're happy to let the other countries to decide these rules for us without any input for us for the sake of having control over CAP and our fisheries policy, which as I've argued in practice we wouldn't actually have full control over anyway.

&gt;Even UKIP advocates negotiating trade agreements before actually leaving the EU. There would be continuation of trade. UK-EU trade would continue. It's a given. It's a given because it is everybody's interests.

I'm not sure why you think negotiating before we left the EU would mean we come away with a favourable deal. I'm sure we could reach some sort of agreement but we would be like Switzerland with nominally bi-lateral negotiations but in practice an imbalance of power.

&gt; EEA members do fully contribute to the costs of a single market. Norway's just had its contributions increased considerably from what they were but still a tiny fraction of the UK's expense, even when they're scaled up to account for the UK's larger GDP.

There is more to France's objections than contributions. There is a cost to providing workers with rights laid out in the Social Chapter which the EFTA countries and the UK don't have to pay which means corporations can set up inside the single market without incurring the costs of workers rights.

&gt;The Conservatives happen to represent by far the main public sentiment. They're the only UK party that beats UKIP. Don't get this the wrong way around. It's not the Conservatives that have themselves to blame for actually representing the people on this!!!
&gt;Ever wondered why the accusation of anti-democracy is so often levelled at the pro-EU crowd? It's commentary like THAT.

When the Conservatives left the EPP they had more MEPs than any of the other parties in the group. There were also other right wing parties in the group, particularly the Eastern European countries that had just joined, that were also sceptical of federalism. They were in a position to take the EPP in far less federalist direction. The fact they chose not to in order to appease the Eurosceptic fringe of their party isn't the fault of the EU or proof the EU is anti-democratic.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;A countries influence is related to the size of it's economy. It's wishful thinking on the part to think that UK would have more power on it's own would have more influence on it's own.

Again, you've just stated something without backing it up.  Why is it wishful thinking?  To back up why it would have more power it would be free to interpret EU regulations as the other EEA countries have, it were to go down that path.  It would have its own seat on the WTO, something which China backs.  It would have control and more money to put into the CAP and CFP.  It would have more control of its judiciary, hence international diplomatic power.  It would still be the military power and influence in this regard with the EU, as a member of NATO and on the Security Council and major player in Europe itself.  It would have more scope with the Commonwealth and the emerging economies, non best placed than the UK, which really, really is saying something.

&gt;This is a bizarre argument. You are saying that the UK is no more in favour of free trade than other countries in the EU like France so we can happily have there own way because they and not going to take the UK in a substantially way than we would have wanted them to go anyway?

Not even UKIP argues that it wants EU trade to go away.  They're all for, even advocate, a free trade agreement with the rest of the rump EU.  The decisions that France will argue will only affect the UK with regards to the free market, and in that sense it only reflects the situation that two thirds of the situation that already exists with two thirds of the current UK trade.  Let Europe establish its trade requirements.  Let the UK industrialists meet it or not.  Laissez-faire.

&gt;Okay, I suppose we better have a look at the Index of Economic Freedom and see if you are right then ...

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_Economic_Freedom

&gt;Nope, it looks like you were wrong. There are a few other countries in the EU that come with the UK in the top 30, but most of them don't.

Did you seriously just link an index dominated by the Commonwealth states, and if not at least with UK heritage, and argue it as a case as to why the UK on its own couldn't make it?

Or did you just try to make a pro-EU argument that other EU states don't register significantly in the top 30  Economic Freedom Index and so the UK is obligated to stay lest the EU has their way and the UK held to a lesser standard, like they're some abused housewife?

You just tried to make a pro-EU argument for the UK by speciously portraying the other EU states as negatively as you could!

&gt;Simply asserting that doesn't make it true. [Re: CAP]

That's projection on your part and doesn't work when I haven't just asserted it but backed it up with numerous substantiated arguments.  The UK is a major net CAP contributor.  FACT.  The UK's farms are set up entirely differently to the European model, we tend to have larger farm holdings, more industrialised, more efficient, than the more numerous but smaller EU tendency.  FACT.  It's not even in dispute.  If the UK is a net contributer it follows that it can pay at least the same to its own farmers, adjust the system to be more specific to UK farms, and still pay less.

&gt;You were accusing pro-Europeans of being anti-democratic a second ago and now you're happy to let the other countries to decide these rules for us without any input for us for the sake of having control over CAP and our fisheries policy, which as I've argued in practice we wouldn't actually have full control over anyway.

a)  The UK would have ultimate control.

b)  I argued if you took everything in the balance, using even a balancing scale metaphor, that the UK would have far more control.

These are the issues the pro-EU lobbyists must address, rather than deflect.

&gt;I'm not sure why you think negotiating before we left the EU would mean we come away with a favourable deal. 

I'm sure because the UK has far more to give.  Equally I'm unsure as to why you think the UK wouldn't.  At least I'm giving examples not platitudes.

&gt;There is more to France's objections than contributions. There is a cost to providing workers with rights laid out in the Social Chapter which the EFTA countries and the UK don't have to pay which means corporations can set up inside the single market without incurring the costs of workers rights.

That's cool.  We've already introduced a sovereignty clause.  Maybe from your perspective we shouldn't have had that power, but we did, and the Conservatives legislated on it.

&gt;When the Conservatives left the EPP they had more MEPs than any of the other parties in the group. There were also other right wing parties in the group, particularly the Eastern European countries that had just joined, that were also sceptical of federalism. They were in a position to take the EPP in far less federalist direction. 

They were in a position too but it didn't happen.  The event already happened.  Has happened.  The EPP decided it was going down the federalist route.  The Conservatives reflected their democratically elected mandate and said no.


They didn't leave the EPP before they went down this route, they tried to work within it.  The position became impossible.

There is no UK mandate to go down the Federalist Europe route so they left.

No CAP, no common fisheries policy, a more restrained approach towards over-legislation. In other matters, just a pragmatic movement of things that most make sense on a European level, on a case by case basis. That means a Europe which follows existing conditions, sometimes tries to create them, but never creates a law which only functions upon meeting conditions which are as yet unmet. I think that means a broadly intergovernmental process for new movement of powers, with European institutions which manage the treaties within formal guidelines, because parliaments always tend to want more powers for themselves. Although the intergovernmental process could operate through some sort of qualified majority. I don't think this all necessarily rules out a future movement towards a federal state, but that would be a long process, and contingent upon the emergence of a distinct interconnected, intercommunicative European demos, or public.

jokes aside some arguments for Cologne:

- you are pretty central. The Ruhrgebiet, Brussels or Paris (Thalys) are just a train hop away. 

- Kölner are more easy going than Berliner

- Going out in Cologne can be relative cheap if you know the right places. Rents however are quite pricy

- If you are already there in February you will witness Karneval (which you will either love or hate, there is no inbetween)

Pro Berlin:

- rents are still cheaper I think

Only the first part was pertinent to the conversation. All members of the European infrastructure are similarly accountable to the people that employed them in a similar manner to how the UK's political infrastructure is accountable while not being directly elected.

&gt; This is not the way it works in the EU. MEPs have only so much power.

That is exactly how it works in the EU, except that as well as directly elected MEPs in the European parliament, we have ministers appointed by the governments they serve and accountable to those governments and people in the European Commission and Council of the EU, and a European Council made up of the Heads of State/Government of each member state as elected by the people of those member states.

No, of course it should be discussed, I just don't think what is happening in Hungary, France, Italy, Greece is not similar to the Weimar Republic.

&gt;How about the ones that we know were important circumstances for the fall of the Weimar Republic?

Exactly. There are a few circumstances that always get mentioned when you talk about the Weimar Republic. If you pick up any book about it, you will see a few things mentioned, just like if you pick up any book about the 30-year war, you will read about Protestants and Catholic.

So, a few of those things that *always* get mentioned, and thus, should be important if one makes a comparison to Greece is:

* Hyperinflation - hasn't happened in Greece

* Just lost a World War - no, again

* Just changed the way the were governed, completely, from Kaiser, to a democry. The Weimar Republic was a very, very young democracy, one year old in fact - Not the case in Greece. 38 years, on par with Spain/Portugal and certainly older than the Eastern European democracies.

* The Versaille treaty and its demands - No, no, Greece do not have to suffer a Versaille treaty

* Dolchstosslegende - stab in the back legend - No, since they haven't really lost a war, it is hard to have that legend.

* Several violent revolution attempts- No

So, if we have to look at the similarities, there should at least be some similarities between the Weimar Republic and Greece, but if one (as you said) look at the important features of it, nothing is similar.

Or, are you saying that I have the wrong features of the Weimar republic? Could you then please explain why my list is wrong, and what you want to remove from it ? For example, if you do not consider hyperinflation a prominent feature of the Weimar Republic, why not, and what are you putting there instead. What do you consider the prominent features of the Weimar Republic to be then?


Or, do you think I do have the right ""key points"" down of the Weimar Republic, but that Greece somehow fit in, where I can't see it? For example, they have not lost a World War, but XX is similar to loosing a World War(I honestly can't even come up with something there).

&gt;There are similarities, and we should be aware of those and the potential consequences for the sake of everyone.

There are always similarities, always. I can draw similarities between Greece now and the Spanish civil war/Vietnam war and the French Revolution. Not to the *key* features though, which is what is important really. One can always compare anything to anything, if one want to.

Pretty much every single bar, cafeteria, cerveceria or tapa restaurant has it on the menu, every Spanish home will cook it probably once or twice a week. A staple food that is great hot or cold; as breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner and 5-in-the-morning after-drinks grub. And since it's so incredibly easy to do and the ingredients you need are available everywhere, you owe it to yourself to try it.

The quantities here are highly variable, but these are a decent rule of thumb. Using onion is optional, but highly recommended. Every spaniard has a different recipe. Try these quantities and experiment from there on.

INGREDIENTS

- 4-5 eggs.

- 0.5 kg / 1 lb potatoes.

- 1 onion.

- Olive oil (around 0.25 l / 8 fl oz or a bit more). Not a very fancy, extra-virgin olive oil, you can do with a cheaper one.

PREPARATION

1. Peel the potatoes and dice 'em up. Garnish them with salt. Finely chop the onion.

2. Put a big pan in your fire of choice with a lot of olive oil. You are going to be deep frying the potatoes on it, so don't be stingy. Don't worry about using a lot of oil: After you are done, you can pick it up and still use it for any cooking (maybe not for salad dressing, but stir frying, deep frying, etc are ok).

3. Set the fire to medium and sloooowly fry the potatoes. You don't want them crispy on the outside: You want them mellow all over. Halfway through add the onion and slowly fry it too. You want to cook it all together until both the potatoes and the onion are mellow.

4. While that's cooking, stir up 4-5 eggs. Add a bit of salt and pepper.

5. When the potatoes and onion are done, mix them with the eggs. Save the oil in the pan, except for a couple spoonfuls.

6. Pour the mix in the pan and cook it on medium-hot fire. You will want to shake the pan (but not stir the mixture!) so the tortilla doesn't stick to the pan.

7. When the tortilla is cooked on one side, it's time for the most crucial step, and the most fun too. Go on, call your guests, show off. It's time to flip the tortilla. Pick up a dish that is as wide or preferibly wider than your pan is. [Stick it on top of the pan and flip the whole thing over](http://www.blogcocina.es/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/como-darle-la-vuelta-a-la-tortilla.png). Be safe: You are dealing with hot oil here. Watch the space around you, mind the kitchen cabinets on top.

8. Put another couple spoonfuls of oil in the pan. Slide the tortilla back in the pan and cook the other side, same as the first one. Marvel at the side that now faces up, the golden colour, the bubbling deliciousness.

9. When it's all cooked, put in on a plate. Serve it hot, or leave it sitting in the counter and serve it cold. Cut a couple slices of french bread, toast them and serve a slice of tortilla on top (which we call pincho de tortilla). Cut it in squares and serve it in your BBQ or tapa dinner. Cut it in two halves as if it was a bagel and stuff it with lettuce, tomato, cheese, jamón serrano and mayonnaise. There's a million ways to serve it, and it goes well with almost everything.

10. Additionally, you can add stuff to the potatoes while frying, to do tortilla de ___: diced chorizo, bell peppers, garlic, diced ham or jamón...",0,1351500913,null,0,false,0,c6ta8ze,t3_129lq8,t1_c6ta8ze,t3_129lq8,null,1430265801,6,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,6

Supply drops of food and medicine, organized by the British, can no longer keep pace with demand.  Initial British attempts to restore a beachhead for civilisation to flourish on the Continent, in Northern France, have failed spectacularly.  Britain stands alone.

Greece, now renamed Deutsch Colony Delta-4 and rented to the UK for nuclear weapons tests, by the weakened and impoverished German state for much needed hard cash, has been ousted from the EU in favour of Turkish accession.

It was easy to get everything sorted out for me because I am married to a German. I recommend that if all else fails and you have to rough it for a while, you might consider looking towards a large city for places in customer service/ communications. This could be considered your fall-back. The jobs market is crying out for English speakers without strong ""non-native"" accents. 

I live outside Berlin in Brandenburg and have Canadian friends at my old job. Their position on arrival was that of tourists but after finding job offers (contract offers) they had no problem getting residency.

Get a good circle of friends early on and take advantage of the networking they will provide for you. I would say to live happily in Berlin and be able to party twice a week, you would want to be earning about 1400 euros before tax as a minimum. An entry level job in customer service will provide about that ( avoid employment agencies at all costs). If you see jobs advertised through them, poach the name of the employer and approach them directly. 

Good luck! Also, contrary to the grumblers in this reddit, Germany is actually a very positive, forward looking place to be. Especially Berlin.

The answer is in the inverted commas around ""family"".

The crucial feature of indirect democracy is the perception of representation, the collective trust in shared aims and expectations that allows the people to put their destiny in the hands of another, safe in the knowledge that even if ‘their’ man doesn’t get the job then the other guy will still be looking after their best interests.

The manner in which this trust is built is the knowledge that you and ‘he’ have a history of cooperation, and that your respective families likewise have a shared social and cultural history of cooperation, all of which allows you to trust that when adversity strikes ‘he’ will act in a predictable and acceptable way.

I simply do not recognise a sufficiently congruent set of aims and expectations to assent to being governed by the common will of the EU.**

**    This should not need saying, but; this does not mean that we should not strive towards harmonious cooperation and collaboration wherever a common viewpoint will bring a more effective outcome.

I would apply ""the mess"" to the whole decision making process and citizen-state-union relations as well. The EU was clearly designed as a partnership between governments, but as it grows and claws deeper into everyday live, it ought to become a more democratic institution that's directly approachable by the people.

A parliament with two chambers, the lower house voted for directly with almost proportional representation (somewhat like the european parliament but more proportional) and the upper house voted for indirectly with skewed representation (not like the US senate, more like the german [Bundesrat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesrat_of_Germany) or a mixture of both), would do us much more justice. Obviously the lower house would deal with more day to day business and determine government, while the upper house keeps the balance between states and the union.

Also the states need to undergo some change. I don't think that different sizes are a problem in and of themselves, but if we choose to live in an united europe we may as well let go of some petty squabbles and give autonomy to those who want it. States with 400k inhabitants have very different interests than those with 83m and if the small states want any representation the quotas have to be horribly skewed. Instead set a upper and lower limit for population and/or economic power (e.g. 10m to 30m) and a timeframe (2030?). Then let the people sort out where they want to belong. States and regions should separate, merge and exchange territories to make new borders that better fit today's world and for territories large enough for sustained independence and small enough to actually adress the people's needs.

Also I think we need a (at least) two tiered system of membership. The UK surely wouldn't want to join in all this, but that doesn't mean they should have to leave the union. Instead have ""full members"" and ""associated members"". Associated members don't take part in certain institutions or treaties (or need to opt-in), so their representatives don't get to vote on these matters, much like the british parliament is also the english parliament, where MP's don't vote in matters of england alone.

Perhaps we could have a two-tier Europe, with a federalizing core, and a wider organization that could play this role for Russia and the Mediterranean region, and for more reluctant countries to join (Britain, and perhaps some others, like Czech Republic, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland should they wish).

true,Oda_Krell,EURO,"German, living in the Netherlands","I made the same observation, and would like to add, it's not just about the service industry, but also large parts of retail. I sometimes get annoyed about it, but I think I know *why* in large parts of Europe this tradition exists, and I understand (to some degree) why people might think it's a good idea. Let me explain:

I think the underlying idea is that we like to keep some kind of community spirit intact by ""enforcing"" parallel periods of rest. My claim applies to the few European countries I know a bit about, Germany, France, the Netherlands. There are exceptions to this rule even in those countries, but by and large, Sunday is supposed to be a day of rest for everybody, and opening hours are supposed to be such that service/retail worker can spend a substantial part of their evening at home, ideally with their family (which is also at home at this time).

Contrast this to, say, Israel, where I was amazed to see shops being open until late in the evening and people going on relaxed trips to the mall at 10 or 11pm (this was Tel Aviv, not sure about the rest of the country).

Anyway, that's my theory. Summarizing: opening hours in parts of Europe are somewhat restrictive and not very customer friendly because of political and cultural ideas (Judeo-Christian tradition plays a role here, even in now secular countries like France or the Netherlands) about a) worker protection, and b) a sense of ""communality"" by sharing the same resting period.

Please note, I'm not saying that's a *good* idea these restrictions exist, in fact, I quite dislike it, but I can see how other people might think it's the right thing to do.

Another thing is that I'm not arguing what Britain should do, I'm just putting out reasons on why there hasn't been a referendum and why there won't be referendum in any time short.

The only way Britexit will be realistically made possible is that Eurozone development needs to have so fundamental treaty changes that EU will split into two entities. At that time it is possible that Britain would elect to go back into simple form of economic co-operation in Europe, but again, British leaders may not want to drive things into a point where EU split will happen, nor are there guarantees that UK would decide leave outside the F.E.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;For the last 5 years I've always seen Merkel and Sarkozy together on TV leading the EU and taking responsibility. I've rarely seen Gordon Brown or David Cameron together with other EU leaders trying to resolve the problems with the union.

Then you've not been paying any attention.

When the economic crisis first hit Gordon Brown was prominent.

Any country that needs an IMF bailout and DC has been prominent.  You're welcome, x30billion.

Last December when the EU was in crisis talks it was DC that made it clear that this wouldn't be used as an excuse to slide other powers in through the side door, like the Tobin Tax Sweden is so dead against.  You're welcome, Sweden.  

When there was conflict on the European doorstep in Libya it was Britain that flew two thirds of all combat-strike missions.  

ISAF?  You Europeans suck and the UK entirely carried your ass. If you don't want to be there or can't justify it, fine, you have a strong argument.  If you say you're going to be there but then pull your soldiers from working nights because it's scary, you suck.   A European army - you're having a laugh.  The UK picked up the European slack.

When Ireland needed a bailout it was the UK that stood in before even the Euro nations and said 'we got your back, put our name down as guarantor in case you default'.  You're talking about a country that already gives more than any other and receives least, per capita.   So you're welcome Sweden, the UK's the one paying the restaurant bill.

Sweden, you seem to think that leadership means coming out with warm happy-clappy positive stories and somehow not doing the shit jobs, or even showing EU scepticism and that putting on the brakes isn't signs of leadership.  Restraint is equally valid when it comes to leadership.

How's this for leadership?  The UK warned the Euro states what it was getting mixed up in and they didn't listen, it's the leading voice again with regards to federalism.

Can't eat the cake and keep it?                 
If you had any decency about you you'd be baking extra cake.

Edit:  In England we have a saying: 'You can suck my balls, I'm going home.'  If you translate it into Swedish it would be....ha, who am I trying to kid?  It's English, we don't translate shit.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; but having Malta veto the entire eu doesn't seem fair either.

they generally can't. votes in the council (weighted by population of each country) and parliament are both taken by a majority vote, generally. The areas where each state has a veto are dwindling treaty by treaty.

&gt; Decisions should be made by the majority of people, not the majority of states.

In most federal structures, and particularly in one that's fairly loose, decisions are made by majority of BOTH. 

&gt; If germany splits into 4 different states (21m people each, only 6 eu states have a higher population right now) that would give us about 30% more voting power.

A fairer parliament is easily done w/o any complication of changing borders - just determine each country's representation in it by Huntington-Hill method. Its designed to minimise differences in number of voters per seat, within rounding.

But, then the upper house, the council shouldn't privilege the large countries as much as it does now, and be closer to one country-one vote. Like US senate. Currently (or actually after the changes made in Lisbon treaty enter into force, by 2014 by default but with an option to revert, and only after 2017 i think obligatory) a (super)majority of states in the council - 55%, needs also represent 65% of the population. The difference of the percentages clearly favours the large states. Esp in their ability to block a decision. So much so that a special clause says that the number of blocking countries need be larger than 4 ! Quite a contrast in comparison to soon 14 were it pure one state one vote.

So I'd accept a huntington-hill parliament, but under the condition the qualified majority in the council was a simple double majority - 50% of the states with 50% of the population (the latter being my concession since some countries are really too tiny). Would simplify decision-making too, since a majority in the council would be easier to find.

Obviously the UK wanted to bail Ireland out ASAP. Isn't the UK Ireland's largest trading partner? If Ireland would have collapsed even more wouldn't the crisis have spread to the UK? Maybe, maybe not. Look at how much % of your GDP in indebted.

Sweden doesn't need a large military anymore. The red threat is gone and we have no interesting in leading and declaring wars. We don't need to have the fourth largest air force in the world anymore. We unlike other European countries were also in Libya. Why? Because we were asked by NATO. There was no reason for us to go to Libya and it was an unpopular decision. It was none of our business.

If you look at the EU budget spending per capita then you will see that Denmark is spending more than three times as much as the UK. Finland is spending almost twice as much the UK per capita. Sweden is not very far behind the UK. However I agree that the EU budget should be more fair than what it is now.

The only reason our government is showing EU skepticism is because many Swedish people are EU skeptic. If any type of government would make us enter the Euro then that government will lose the next election and possibly not be elected again for a very long time. If the population would have been indifferent we would have joined the Euro a long time ago (for the better or the worse).

The financial crisis started in the US. Southern European countries were a lot more economically unstable than what was thought. If there was no Euro then all the southern countries would devalue their currency like crazy and print money. How much better would that have been?

Which it was written in as an autonomous region in 1974. So if it can be written in, why cant it be written out later?

It is not that Albanians do not have a nation state. They have, it is called Albania and it borders on Serbia. If Albanians do not like it in Serbia, they can just move to their nation state.

Also, the two main reasons for joining the EU are to expand the area of ​​peace and of prosperity. For some, the entry of Turkey could contribute to expand the area of ​​peace: it breaks the logic of the clash of civilizations. Having a country where the population is mostly Muslim could be a calming measure. On the other hand, you could see having Turkey in the EU as the contrary of the expansion of the area of peace: to let them being in the EU means to give to the EU borders with countries that are not in peace like Syria or Iran.

I think Turkey in the EU is mainly a question of political expediency. Turkey is a big country, populous, and if it joins the EU, it will be the most populous country in the EU. This country has always had a geostrategic importance, its history makes it would have an important role in the EU. The countries hostile to its entry are mainly the large ones like France or Germany for fear of being competed. Turkey will weight in decisions and its non-adhesion could be mainly due to the fact that other countries are scared of the weight of Turkey in the EU.

Why? Numbers game. There are some extremely populous countries that can even be surrounded by other populous countries, and if you want to overwhelm a local culture you need to do it properly. Turkey and Egypt are far too big to easily overwhelm, especially when comparing the numbers of youth.

Muslim countries of a reasonable size would be:      
**Tunisia** (10.7 million). VERY close to Europe and isolated quite nicely from its neighbours by desert (and both its immediate neighbours are pretty small).       
**Libya** (6.4 million). Also rather close and it has lovely, lovely oil as a bonus. However, there are some radical elements (though with such a low population, suppressing them need not be too difficult if a proper media blitz is aimed and sustained) and the extremely populous Egypt is a neighbour and its population might interfere or force its politicians to interfere.

Lebanon and Azerbaijan are the only others that really fit the criteria, but they're geographically way the hell out there so not really viable.

And we totally shouldn't do this until we have, for example, the EU equivalent of FBI ready to crack down on corruption.

You're right that there are many large but silent interests that would still want to be in the EU, most business lobbies and the City I would guess, but they also would be very wary of Federalisation (Euro and FTT aren't really in their interests).

Like I said earlier, if there would be referendum in UK, it would be in a situation where the EU would be splitting, keeping status quo wouldn't be an option then, options would either be to go back in integration, or join the core. In that situation, any pro-side would have to be support joining the Euro and everything that comes with it.

&gt; You're got that totally the wrong way round. There are several examples of countries freely trading with the EU while not being a member. As the Euro crisis has shown the Federalists don't really know what they're doing. I'm not saying they're operating in bad faith though, they just rush in to things.

Norway and Iceland are EEA members and Switzerland has treaty that is EEA in all but name. They are part of the single market, but don't have opportunity to impact single market legislation. I don't think that UK could go with that. Britain is too big country to just settle down on things.

&gt; If the Eurozone continues to try and get the Euro-outs to try and sign treaties designed to solve the Eurozone's problems then the sceptics win by default because there will no vision of the EU that can be sold to the UK populace.

Actually Eurozone has had to do this, because EU treaty changes are not possible without unanimity. Another thing to note is that all other EU-members than UK and Denmark have treaty obligation to join the Eurozone and that is the reason why the whole EU has had to step in lock with the Eurozone.

However as this has been more or less hard to do, I think that many more people are willing to accept that Eurozone needs to start following its own independent trajectory. The logical consequence of this is that current EU will cease to exist and it will split into Eurozone, countries wanting to join it, and countries secluding from it.

The addition of Romania and Bulgaria helped the Economy of the new and old EU Countries, but it also caused several problems. 
If I remember some EU Reports correctly, after joining the EU, fighting organized crime and corruption plus the developing of an independent judiciary came to an hold (more or less). 
Not only is this causing problems for the citizens of Romania (AFAIK some of the EU help you should get to develop your country further is wasted because of corruption) , it also means that the EU is supporting yet another corrupted government.

It don't think German politicians are demanding anything from the citizens of Romania, they are demanding changes from your politicians. 
But sadly the only way to demand such things is the threat of stopping EU Aids, which will not hurt corrupt politicians but the citizens. 

So it is not really a viable way to force a change. 
Demanding certain Reforms before a joining is probably the right way.

What has happened, in a nutshell, is that, because of the crisis, the disillusioned vote rose in Greece. As a result, some right-wing thugs called ""Golden Dawn gained in the polls (still under 10%, though more than they normally should). 
They had addressed the problem of immigration, something the others avoided. And this went a long way towards getting them enough votes to be lifted from complete obscurity.

But so what? Nobody **seriously** believes that a political party mimicking the slogans, imagery and symbolism of the 1930's(!!!) could **actually** take over. For all their pompous role-playing, all such groups are simply too ridiculous to be much more than almost a Halloween thing.

Right now, in the USA, for example, there are over [**100 Active Neo-Nazi Groups**](http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/neo-nazi/active_hate_groups).

Golden Dawn's chances of gaining a majority in Greece is actually **zero**. And, here is the thing, **everybody** (with an IQ over two digits) knows it!

How do you do it? I think it's just cumulation of little opportunities. Many people can come into work after 9am. So you can squeeze something before that. Many leave before 5pm. Then there's Saturday. There's comparatively longer opening hours on Thursday for banks and the like (whopping 18.00 closing time! Woohoo!). You might work part time. You might work irregular hours. You might not work at all. If all of this doesn't apply to you, you might know someone to whom it does, and ask him for a favor.

Thankfully though there were thousands of Poles coming in and going back. There were plenty of jobs for everyone except for the really lazy British workers.

The poles who stayed have got better jobs now and have intergrated. I hope they keep on staying in the UK. 

For the Bulgarians and the Romanians? They don't have the same chance. The economy is a wreck and ordinary people are struggling to get jobs.

Doesn't concern Britain as it will get opt-out, thus cast-iron guarantee Cameron can say that there is no need for referendum. And if you would have read more carefully, you would have noted that I talked about future governments, not this cabinet.

&gt; To find one sane British person that thinks what you just said is remotely true and to clone them 20 million times by the 2014 European election because that's what you'll need for any pretense of a mandate to change the constitution. There's also the very real chance that UKIP will be competing with the Conservatives for the number one spot.

European elections don't mean anything for the UK European politics. What only counts are the parliamentary elections.

&gt;  Hear that, Ireland? You did not have two referendums because that would be subversive. Denmark, you can shut up too. Ze Europeans have spoken. Nobody mention Maastricht. Nobody mention Nice. Ireland that treaty you signed after the second referendum wasn't EXACTLY the same as the one you rejected in the first referendum.

Don't care, I'm not Irish, nor citizen of Ireland.

&gt; I got the result I wanted actually. On reflection I was right. Bringing republics into it doesn't make any sense. It was a referendum on voting.

You have republics and you have democracies. Two different things. 

&gt; Keep talking because it's people like you that fuel UK scepticism of EU intentions and you're clearly not interested in addressing UK public opinion but how best to circumvent it. Scepticism is healthy, it's why the UK is now the one in the best position for negotiation.

I don't care what Britain or British do, don't care if they are in or out. The whole conversation started from me noting that UK referendum on exiting the EU is not very likely and that the referendum won't be simply a choice between keeping status quo or exiting, if and when the choices arises, it will either going back in integration or going forward with it. 

And in case of negotiations, the fact of the matter is that Eurozone is a behemoth of over 300 million inhabitants with the second largest economy in the world, while Britain isn't a small country, size does matter when it is negotiation time.

&gt; To their credit the UK did try to warn the rest of Europe.

Der Ober reisst überrascht die Augen auf angesichts des plötzlich aufgetauchten Gastes zu später Stunde, sagt aber nichts, als er sieht, dass der Mann sein Mobiltelefon direkt in einer Lache Spülwasser platziert hat.

Gast: Herr Ober! Kann ich die Karte haben? 

Er sieht abwechselnd den Ober und seine Armbanduhr an.
	
Ober: *verdreht die Augen, überlegt es sich anders um erwiedert kackfreundlich* Aber natürlich! Bitte sehr!

Der Ober reicht ihm die Karte und stellt auch die Streuer auf den Tisch.

Gast: Danke danke! *er blätter wild zwischen den drei Seiten hin und her* Haben Sie auch Wein?

Ober: ... klar! Was hätten Sie denn gerne? Roten oder Weißen?

Gast: Rotwein, bitte. *er holt Luft* Ich trinke nämlich keinen Weißwein.

Ober: *unterdrückt ein Lachen* ... möchten Sie vielleicht auch eine Beilage zu Ihrem Wein?

Gast: Ein Käsebrötchen, falls es Ihnen keine Umstände macht..? *er sieht den Ober fragend an*

Der Ober kämpft mit seiner Selbstbeherrschung angesichts dieser skurilen Situation.

Ober: *triefend vor Sarkasmus* Kommt sofort.

Oh, yes, Israel, who gave its Arab inhabitants citizenship and has always maintained Arabic as an official language of Israel, and which has been in negotiations for 20 years to give the Palestinians as much autonomy as they can while maintaining Israel's security, is so much worse than the Turks, who refused to acknowledge the Kurds' existence as a separate people for half a century and who have no intention of ever giving the Kurds even autonomy within the Turkish republic, let alone independence.

Frankly, it's a ridiculous comparison. Israel is in a shitty situation, mostly of its own making, but it's trying to do the best it can. Turkey is pretty much an unapologetic imperialist whose position on the Kurds is not measurably different from 1950s France's position on *Algérie française*, and their relationship to North Cyprus involves just as much occupation and settlement (of Anatolian Turks onto Cyprus) as Israel's relationship with the West Bank. Moreover, more people were killed and displaced during Turkey's anti-insurgency war against the Kurds than have been killed or displaced in 60 years of Jewish-Palestinian fighting.

I don't think Israel should join the EU, but saying it's worse than Turkey is just not true. It's unfair to Israelis, who do try very hard to examine their mistakes and learn from them; the Turks are pretty unrepentant, both about former actions (the genocide of Anatolian Christians) and current ones (the Kurdish problem, the Cyprus occupation).

Also,  I think the comparison between the Palestinian situation and apartheid is inaccurate. The Bantustans were never recognized by any foreign country; Palestine enjoys the recognition of over 100 countries. The Palestinian National Authority may be an undemocratic dictatorship (or two, if you count both the Fatah and the Hamas PAs), but it is demonstrably more independent of Israel than the Bantustans were of SA, and its lack of democracy is not Israel's doing, but the result of infighting between Palestinian factions.",0,1351541845,null,0,false,0,c6tif2w,t3_129o75,t1_c6tif2w,t1_c6tbl2s,null,1430269706,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

If it wasn't for the Soviets funding the militias and, after the revolution of 1974, Mário Soares giving the territories away, Cape Verde would still be Portuguese and, by consequence, now in the EU like the Azores or Madeira.

Obviously that didn't happen like that and despite Cape Verde being uninhabited before the Portuguese colonization, all [the Portuguese moved back to Portugal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retornados#The_retornados) after its independence and the islands became abandoned to the militias. And even so, IIRC, more than 50% of all Cape Verdeans live in Portugal rather than in Cape Verde.

So Germany won't be pushing for budget reform in the upwards direction then?  That that doesn't concern UK, that the UK hasn't said it would veto it, so they'd have to go for a power grab

So Lisbon suddenly doesn't have a ratchet clause in it?  That not only does it not exist, they definitely didn't put it in there for any reason like intention to use it, and Britain most definitely has not passed an anti-ratchet clause which means referendum.

Wow.  Glad we cleared that one up.

&gt;And if you would have read more carefully, you would have noted that I talked about future governments, not this cabinet.

        ""So Europe's not going to try and claim an extra powers 
         to sort the crisis before 2015 then."" 

2015 being when the next General Election will most likely be.

You have permission to feel stupid.

&gt;European elections don't mean anything for the UK European politics. What only counts are the parliamentary elections.

They most certainly do, it's a clear indication of the mandate the public is willing to give on one single topic; Europe.  If a new government comes into power supporting a federal Europe (an electable party which simply does not currently exist) and UKIP and Conservatives are 1 and 2 there'll be an insurrection before Britain goes down the Federal route by writing the need for referendum out of the UK constitution.

You're trying to tell me about UK politics and you don't have the first clue about the current landscape.  As in you have no idea whatsoever.

There is not a single electable party in existence that can change the UK constitution to *rule out* an EU referendum, which is exactly what you're talking about.  It simply doesn't exist.

&gt;Don't care, I'm not Irish, nor citizen of Ireland.

That's another reason why EU scepticism has become so rife.  You've just said you don't care about a country's democratic choice as long as the power grab that you want goes through, even if its against their will.

If I could frame that and hang it on the wall I would, and I'd point at it anytime somebody asked why the EU was dangerous.  I'd say these are the people that you're going into union with and they neither respect or care because they do not consider themselves the same, or identify with a common European heritage.  They don't care because ""they are not a citizen of xxxxxxx""

&gt;You have republics and you have democracies. Two different things.

Your tangents just get stranger.  As a reminder you're saying this in reference to the UK referendum vote and how you argue the UK can't make the right decisions for the UK, but you over in Finland can identify what is right for the UK.

&gt;And in case of negotiations, the fact of the matter is that Eurozone is a behemoth of over 300 million inhabitants with the second largest economy in the world, while Britain isn't a small country, size does matter when it is negotiation time.

I don't know if you've noticed but Germany is pretty much all tapped out thanks to Greece and Spain.  Forget about Italy, and they so very, very much need massive reform...and Britain has the veto.  Shit eating grin time again because we know the cards that are in our hand.

&gt;the Eurozone is already a different place than it was when it was created and before the crisis started, and the change has been for the better.

The recent Eurozone developments has been a change for the better?

E' vero anche che come esempio non sono proprio il migliore: circa due anni fa, quando ho lasciato la mia bici saldamente incatenata in cortile per poche ore, di sera (tipo 3 ore)  e mi è stata rubata, nonostante io sia sempre un tipo pacifico, incline alla mediazione, con la pazienza dei ciula (come si dice dalle mie parti), ho deciso che invece a sto giro mi giravano i coglioni. Dato che vivo in fondo ad una breve via chiusa e l'affluenza di persone esterne al condominio è ridotta ai minimi storici ho affisso dei bei volantini sulle porte di ingresso dei due palazzi che formano il complesso condominiale recitanti che la persona che ""per sbaglio"" aveva confuso la mia bici con la sua, me l'avrebbe potuta tranquillamente riportare indicando appartamento nome e cognome. Una settimana dopo (e dopo due volte che il volantino veniva strappato e ri-affisso) ho bucato la ruota anteriore di tutte le macchine presenti nella via chiusa dove vivo. Questo gesto mi ha fatto osservare 3 cose: Ora se viene lasciata una bici in cortile per un tempo accettabile (nel rispetto delle regole condominiali e lontana dalle finestre del piano terra, dato che le sciure hanno sempre paura che un ladro usi la bici per entrargli in casa) questa non viene toccata nemmeno per essere lucidata, a nessuno è fregato un cazzo di avere la gomma bucata dato che nessuno ne ha parlato con nessuno (nonostante il mio sia un condominio dove tra di noi si parla molto), tutti hanno immaginato che il colpevole dei fori fossi io ma nessuno mi ha tolto il saluto anzi raccolgo più sorrisi di prima quindi mi sono fatto l'idea che, almeno nel mio palazzo, se fai il mafioso\ras del quartiere la gente ti rispetta.

In conclusione, non ti consiglio di prendere ad esempio la mia incivilità mossa dalla rabbia, ma di essere un po' più deciso, perché la mancata osservanza di un regolamento non giustifica il danneggiamento di una proprietà, al massimo potevano citofonarti sbraitando come facevano nel mio vecchio condominio (non a me che di solito sono un rigido osservante delle regole condominiali).",0,1351544131,null,0,false,0,c6tj16g,t3_129vn0,t1_c6tj16g,t3_129vn0,null,1430269994,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

If Britain uses veto, then the EU budget will still go up automatically, but it is based on the last budget period plus inflation. That is actually something that the UK doesn't want either, because it will mean that there is no change on where the EU spends its money.

&gt; That's another reason why EU scepticism has become so rife. You've just said you don't care about a country's democratic choice as long as the power grab that you want goes through, even if its against their will.

Why should I? The Irish or any other country can always exit the union if they don't want to be in it any more, but it seems that people don't have problem on being in the union, because no country hasn't made an exit.

&gt; Your tangents just get stranger. As a reminder you're saying this in reference to the UK referendum vote and how you argue the UK can't make the right decisions for the UK, but you over in Finland can identify what is right for the UK.

Essentially yes. If you are smart and educated and have the brain capacity, then you will much better informed and can make a better judgement. The fact is that 98% of people have an IQ of less than 130. Again a fact. Most people can't handle lots of information and certainly not on how complex systems work.

&gt;  I don't know if you've noticed but Germany is pretty much all tapped out thanks to Greece and Spain. Forget about Italy, and they so very, very much need massive reform...and Britain has the veto. Shit eating grin time again because we know the cards that are in our hand.

Germany hasn't been tapped out, what they have understood is that what is needed in the Euzone is active monetary policy lead by the ECB that can use all the tools it needs to do the job. In the next years, probably after crisis has gone, people will go into the drawing board and make a new EU treaty that will gather all lessons learned into a new design.

Now Britain does have power to veto, but that doesn't necessarily work. Already with the European Fiscal Compact what the Eurozone and other countries was to negotiated intergovernmental treaty that side stepped EU mechanisms and thus the British veto. If there would be any serious issue with the British veto concerning a crucial Eurozone reform, there is real possibility of zone just sidestepping the whole EU, organizing their own union and moving into it.

&gt;  The recent Eurozone developments has been a change for the better?

Yes. There is now the ESM together with new banking regulator. Together they allow the Eurozone to better handle local or regional fiscal crisis and keep the banking sector stable.

This means most EU-countries, minus UK, plus Switzerland and Norway. The result of Schengen, and including  eastern Europe, was a flood of criminals and beggars to all included countries. The dream of travel without a passport inside EU was soon shattered, as airlines and hotels still require you to bring a passport. This politic with open borders have resulted in situations like this; a person coming to Norway to commit crime, is captured and convicted. After finishing his sentence, he's to leave the country, and gets ban on coming back. So he's escorted to the border. Then he waits, maybe a day or two, and just goes back to Norway to continue his crime-spree. Because there's no border control.

Same with illegal immigrants to eu; once they get inside the eu-zone, usually through Greece, Spain or Italy, they're impossible to get rid of. Most of the refugees who come to Norway, is sent from another eu-country. If their request for stay is denied, then the rule say they have to go back to the eu-country where they first were registered. But, as there are no border control inside EU, besides UK, they can easily go where they want, despite rejected request or not! And it gets really nice when it comes to people ""impossible to determine identity""!

*They were being forcibly sterilized about a decade ago*. That's a big deal, not even counting the horseshit that goes on today.

First off I would also say that no - there has never been another ethnicity that has been abused the way the gypsies have been for as long as they have been. It's been centuries with only small changes in the degree of persecution that exists.


Secondly: Many other ethnicities have a homeland and government to support them. Gypsies/Romani don't. They've got little in the way of representation, almost never gotten any form of apology, and certainly never got assistance the way the Jewish people did after World War 2.

Europe pretty much picked up after their genocide in WWII and continued making the same mistakes of the past(minus the genocide).

The paper concludes that austerity policy hardly played any role for debt reduction, that there is no success without strong economic growth, that inflation helped as well as political repression to keep interest rates down. Vittori also cites other papers concluding that austerity policy can never bring down public debt levels sufficiently when there is neither economic growth nor inflation.
