I don't believe this is possible if EU is to be as minimally integrated as it is. Bulk of the current text is spelling out competency by competecy what the EU can decide about, and by what method.

They could fork off a more basic clear fundamental text, though there already is the 
Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , which is like any other human rights text, and pretty readable. And maybe pull into something separate the basic parts of the TEU spelling out EU's 'constitutional' order and institutions, and principles, from the more specific stuff about defence and foreign policy.

But making TFEU clearer is possible only by giving EU sweeping powers over whole areas where it currently had only point-by-point competencies. And I wouldn't like that.

With continued non-compliance the deposit is converted into a fine. In addition, automatic sanctions are triggered, based on a different voting mechanism in the Council of the European Union. At the same time the national accounts statistics and forecast practices of Member States are adjusted to comply with EU standards. If it is determined that a country has reported false data, an additional fine may be imposed.[4]

From Wiki. Has that happened though. From what I understand then, all the states in the Eurozone should be fined, maybe apart from Finland, Estonia and Luxemburg. Has that happened?  Have most of the states done interest bearing deposits?

read the links ffs, there was no interest-bearing deposits in the old SGP. Introduced last year. Made the establishment of a breach easier too, with the commission rather than the member states doing most of the deciding. Before a large country could easily get away with it since no super-majority could form to introduce a fine. Now a super-majority is needed to block a penalty if commission deems it necessary. Added extra types of breaches, including excessive debt and macroeconomic imbalances, that weren't even regulated before, yet are most of what went wrong in the post-2008 crash we're living through.

Ofc goals haven't changed - fiscal prudence of member states.

&gt; From what I understand then, all the states in the Eurozone should be fined, maybe apart from Finland, Estonia and Luxemburg.

You don't understand it correctly then: 

&gt;F or example, when a country, **against which an excessive deficit procedure was opened**,** fails to take necessary measures** to eliminate its deficit, an interest-bearing deposit in the amount of 0.2% of GDP is due.

So, commission opens the excessive deficit procedure, and the countries need to justify their actions to curtail the deficits. If the commission is unhappy, they get progressively tougher fines.

It would be beyond ridiculous if a country in financial troubles was simply automatically fined, to worsen its troubles, even if it is tackling its deficit reasonably.

active proceedings do cover most states ofc:

http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/deficit/index_en.htm

When the Council decides that a deficit is excessive, it makes recommendations to the Member State concerned and **establishes deadlines for effective corrective action** to be taken.

So, if the Portuguese indicators are pointing downwards, it is the fault of higher taxes? I can think of a lot of other reasons, corruption, borrowing to much in the early Euro years, building up a system one can't afford, etc (don't know if all this apply to Portugal), or are these indicators in perfect correlation with taxes?

I honestly don't know how sound our economies are,

I certainly agree with that.

The adjustment path towards the correction of the
excessive deficit shall aim to achieve a general government
primary deficit (deficit excluding interest expenditure) not
exceeding EUR 2 037 million (1,0 % of GDP) in 2012,
and primary surpluses of at least EUR 3 652 million (1,8 %
of GDP) in 2013 and EUR 9 352 million (4,5 % of GDP) in
2014. Following the debt exchange, these targets for the
primary deficit/surplus are consistent with an overall
deficit of EUR 14 811 million (7,3 % of GDP) in 2012,
EUR 9 462 million (4,7 % of GDP) in 2013 and EUR
4 499 million (2,2 % of GDP) in 2014. To this aim, an
improvement in the structural balance of at least 10 % of
GDP will have been achieved over the period 2009-2014.
Proceeds from the privatisation of assets (financial and non-
financial assets), as well as all transfers related to the
Eurogroup decision of 21 February 2012 with regard to
the income of euro zone national central banks, including
the Bank of Greece, stemming from their investment
portfolio holdings of Greek government bonds shall not
reduce the required fiscal consolidation effort and shall
not be counted in the assessment of these targets.

&gt; Greece shall adopt the following measures without
delay:

... (bunch of stuff they need to do)

&gt; Greece shall adopt the following measures by the
end of September 2012:

... (more stuff)  

etc

with a bunch of other countries, no further proceedings were taken (and this is by the old procedure) as far as I can find, and they're just expected to get back under the mark by 2013.

The Council examined a communication from the Commission assessing the action taken by
Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria,
Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and the United Kingdom to bring their government deficits below the
3 % reference value set by the Treaty for the ratio of deficit to gross domestic product (GDP).
The Council shared the Commission's view that, according to the information currently available:
− those thirteen Member States had up to now acted in accordance with its recommendations;
− no additional step in the excessive deficit procedure is therefore necessary at this stage.
Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and
Slovakia have been subject to an excessive deficit procedure since December 2009, as have Ireland,
Spain and France since April 2009 and the United Kingdom since July 2008.
In the recommendations addressed to them on corrective action to be taken, the Council required
Belgium and Italy to bring their deficits below the 3 % of GDP threshold in 2012 at the latest and
the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia to do so
in 2013.
In the case of Ireland, Spain and France, the Council revised its recommendations in
December 2009 following a deterioration in the economic situation in those countries, which had
taken appropriate action to comply. It then required Spain and France to bring their deficits below
the 3 % of GDP threshold in 2013 at the latest and Ireland to so in 2014.
In the case of the United Kingdom, the Council adopted a decision in April 2009 deeming
insufficient the action taken pursuant to its first recommendation and made a new recommendation.
In December 2009 it revised the new recommendation in the light of a deterioration in the economic
situation in the United Kingdom, which had taken appropriate action to comply. The Council then
required that the deficit be brought below the 3 % of GDP threshold in the 2014-15 financial year at
the latest.


with Spain though, its much worse, but they're happy with the measures taken:

no, the excessive deficit procedure fines countries that fail to implement fiscal measures demanded by them from the Commission in order to correct their deficit. That deserves a fine. Not merely having a struggling economy and inherited past fuckups.

Transitory deficits beyond the mark are not forbidded by the SGP, nor could they be since the revenue side of the calculation depends on the economic situation in the country, only not doing much about them is, or creating them yet not having any objective economic problems  - like did Finland in 2010.

OK, maybe I expressed myself badly. What I mean is that the stability pact states (among other things) that you should not have a budget deficit that is more than 3 %, an inflation that is more than 2 % higher than the lowest 3 countries and a debt/GDP ratio that is higher than 60 % of the GDP.

What you said about the budget deficit, is correct (in your other message), the countries are working at getting it down. However, almost every country is having an *increase* in debt/GDP. The stability pact is not just about budget deficit it is about a lot of other measurements as well. What does it matter if they have a low budget deficit, if their debt goes up all the time. 

[For example, Belgium](http://www.debtagency.be/en_data_public_finances.htm). They *should* be working at getting their debt levels down, but apparently, they are not. 

Italy's debt has increased as well, they have one of the highest in the EU, and let us not forget Spain or Germany. 

If you keep on increasing your debt ratio, you either have to be the US (and we all wonder for how long they will be the reseve currency of the world), or - don't. 

Why aren't they focusing on lowering the debt? I am not aware that the stability pact said one could ignore that? And, unlike budget deficits, the debts are growing. 


&gt;you think countries currently in trouble are misbehaving? Not a single country in trouble has not implemented what the EU,ECB,IMF demanded - they're all aggressively slashing expenditures. For what are they supposed to get punished?

Greece haven't even implemented the conditions from the *first* bailout, nevermind the second (they were among other things, supposed to fire something like 150 000 civil servant workers, since they have a bloated and very, very unproductive public sector. I think they might have fired a few thousands). And, there are other things Greece hasn't done as well, so at least Greece should be punished.

I can't speak for Greece but while Neo Nazis in Germany make your life hard with racism and violence the Antifa is trying to make you feel as guilty as possible about not hating your country. When the European Football Championship was running, they went through the streets and broke off little flags you can put between the window and the door frame of your car just to place a little tag there that you're not better than the nazis for showing that flag. That's by the way the only reason we ever show flags. Football. 

Yesterday was the day of German unity (that's the day when west and east Germany where one country again) and, of course, somebody made a nazi reference because we don't hate that this day is a holiday (we don't even celebrate it). 

Extremism is never good. Neither left nor right. Neither political nor religious. 

Edit: I didn't used stuff like ""making you feel guilty for loving your country"" because most people actually don't love Germany but like to show flag when football is on or something harmless like that.

&gt;...
&gt;Why aren't they focusing on lowering the debt? I am not aware that the stability pact said one could ignore that? And, unlike budget deficits, the debts are growing. 

yeah, one of the ridiculousness of the old SGP was that you really coudn't punish the country for exceeding the debt criteria. Only excessive deficit procedure existed, such as it was. One of the things changed last year (and entered into force in december I think) was that:

http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/12/7

&gt; It is now possible to open an EDP on the basis of the debt criterion. A Member State can be put in EDP **if the gap between its debt level and the 60% of GDP reference is not reduced by 1/20th annually (on average over three years)** – even if the deficit of the country concerned is below 3% of GDP. 

but:
&gt; Member States in EDP before the six-pack was adopted are granted a **three-year period** for meeting the ""1/20th-debt-rule"", **following the correction of the excessive deficit.** Nevertheless, they must show sufficient progress towards compliance.

So, as long as they're showing *progress towards compliance*, I guess they still have time. Otherwise, fines may hit them.

&gt;Greece haven't even implemented the conditions from the first bailout,

Correspondence about Greece there is fairly voluminous, I didn't read it now. But one thing that comes to mind is that bailout conditions needn't be the same as the stability pact conditions. And the last correspondence had a large list of measures and deadlines, so I guess they still have some time to meet them.

report on Belgium is mixed - try skimming it. They had to get out of excessive deficit in this year's budget

&gt;Taking into account the 2012 draft budget and the additional measures subsequently decided,
it is now likely that the deficit would decline to about 23⁄4% of GDP, as a result of the lasting
impact of the measures entered into force in 2011, of the effect of additional measures
scheduled to enter into force in 2012 and of the recovery in growth after the slowdown in
2012 as foreseen in the Commission Services' 2011Autumn Forecast.


&gt; the latest forecast from the National Bank of Belgium indicates that the
government deficit might have turned out at 4.2% of GDP in 2011, substantially higher than
the 3.6% of GDP on which the 2012 budget was built. About half of this upward revision
would be explained by recurrent factors, the rest being due to additional, presumably non-
recurrent spending related to the support of Dexia. 

last section is on debt, and apparently this isn't expected to give results in the near future, nor are they saying what level they need to target:

&gt;an additional annual tructural fiscal consolidation of 0.5 p.p. of GDP from 2014 onwards in order to reach the
MTO would almost stabilise the debt ratio, reaching 101 % of GDP in 2020. A more
ambitious consolidation effort (of 1 p.p. per annum) would set the debt ratio on a declining
path from 2015 onwards in Belgium.

In any case, I guess recommendation to this effect (ie more tightening) will come after the end of the evaluation of the deficit situation and targets.

First, have you installed it already? If not, I would suggest doing that, as it's more reliable than using the online demo (no chance of material being lost). You can go [here](http://lwt.sourceforge.net/#installmac) if you have a Mac or [here](http://lwt.sourceforge.net/#installwin) if you have a PC.
(Side note: Not sure about you, but the instructions looked really daunting to me at first. It's honestly not as bad as it looks, haha.)

Anyway.

Short reply: Basically, create new texts from any kind of material you want. Define words by clicking on them, color-code the words based on how well you know them. As you better learn the word, you can change the color by clicking the word, then choosing one of the numbers in brackets. You can add accompanying MP3s to documents if you want.


Long reply: Once you have it installed, open LWT in your web browser, go to ""My Texts,"" and hit ""New Text."" You can use articles from sites like Deutsche Welle (which I adore), ZDF, or LingQ; you can use poems or song lyrics; or even create your own vocabulary list. I like using articles that have an accompanying MP3, because you can add the MP3 to a document and listen as you read.

When you're done, hit ""Save and Open."" At first, all of the words will be highlighted in blue, which means they haven't been defined yet. You can change this by clicking the word, where there will be 2 fields that pop up to the right. One will be a dictionary (you can edit which dictionary is the default - my favorite is [Leo](http://dict.leo.org) - by going into ""My Languages -&gt; Edit Language."" Further detail on that [here](http://lwt.sourceforge.net/#howto) ). 

The other will be a field where you type in the definition, so that LWT can store it. You can add tags, which I like to use for noting gender and whether the word is formal/slang/dialect/etc., but of course it's optional. The ""Status"" determines what color the word will be highlighted in, which is based on how well you know the word. When you initially define it, the word will be highlighted in red, which of course means it's a new word that you're unfamiliar with. You can change the color of the word by clicking [2] [3], etc, or [WKn] which means that you know the word well.

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkcVJ6SpK2Q) is a good (brief) video demonstrating some of these things. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSLPOATWAU4&amp;feature=related) is a (long) video that goes more in-depth. For this one I'd start at about 6 minutes in, because that's when he gets to the real meat &amp; potatoes of how to use LWT.

So having this in mind we first need to evaluate the purchasing power parity of an average individual in a given country. So what is one easy way to achieve this? The ""Big Mac Index"". What does it tell us? It tell us among other things how much does a Mac cost in your country. =) Check it out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index

After this we need to find the ""Average disposable wage"". This is a number that tell us roughly how much money is left in average out of your salary after tax is collected.

With this data we can make very simple math. How many Bic Macs can a average individual buy in his country with his average wage (Average disposable wage/Big Mac price):

PT - 3876  


So as you can see, in order for Sweden to have same purchasing power as Portugal, taxes need to actually be increased in Sweden. Note that this is rough calculation but its deviation is not far from truth, obviously playing with tax rates can directly influence the Big Mac value.

The liberal guide to reduce the deficit is to heavily cut spending whilst avoiding raising taxes, clearly the current government does not follow this recipe as they've focusing too much on trying to increase revenue.

And anyway Antifa should be a broader term encompassing many parts of the society. Not only the anarchists do Antifa. All the left does, from Antarsya to Syriza.

Je comprends que ça puisse vous intéresser de savoir si ce sont des gentils créateurs de richesse et d'emploi ou des méchants égoïstes avides et manipulateurs. Mais on reste dans une logique de conservation des privilèges,  qui n'est ni de droite ni de gauche. Les vraies propositions pour réformer sérieusement l'état, réduire l'emmerdement d'une création d'entreprise et favoriser la création d'emploi se font toujours attendre. Le changement, ce sera pour plus tard.

Les deux principes simples qui s'opposent dans le débat, c'est d'une part que les revenus du travail soient taxés autant que ceux du capital, d'autre part que le risque soit pris en compte dans la taxation. Le raisonnement est que la rémunération est liée au risque : entre deux projets/postes avec même gain, je prends le moins risqué ; entre deux projets/postes de même risque, je prends celui qui rapporte le plus.

Or, dans le travail, le risque (maladie, licenciement) est couvert pour les salariés (chômage, assurance maladie) mais pas pour les entrepreneurs et investisseurs, tandis que le gain (rémunération) des entrepreneurs est faible au début (pas de salaire etc.) tandis qu'il est assuré pour les salariés. Du coup, comme il est peu probable que le gouvernement baisse le risque à être entrepreneur/investisseur ou augmente les aides, ils veulent continuer à bénéficier d'une taxation favorable/privilégiée en cas de réussite.",0,1349375056,null,0,1349441624,0,c6hmpxf,t3_10u203,t1_c6hmpxf,t1_c6gx8jp,null,1435680571,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

Greece saw a fierce civil war after the occupation of the Nazis, five years of left and right slaughtering each other. This event has left its imprints on the Greek society and its effects are until today seen. Ultra-left/anarchists and ultra-rights hate each other guts in Greece that's why the whole rhetoric of ""we have to smash them"" by both sides.

GD is the descendant of the Security Battalions that were collaborating with the Germans. This part of society never disappeared but continued to function either outside or inside the official political life. They are fierce enemies of everything communistic and ""un-patriotic"", hard-core Orthodox Christians (although I guess the phrase of Jesus Christ  ""help your fellow men"" doesn't apply to people seeking a better life in Europe), love the military (party members of GD when their leader appear stand in attention position and shout like in the army), love discipline and a ultra-conservative way of life, hate homosexuals and regard disabled and mentally ill people not worthy of living. Their best time was in the latest military junta (1967-74) where they were able to exile, torture, imprison and execute many leftists and people who opposed them in general. 

After the end of the junta these people either formed small political parties or went ahead to become part of the New Democracy party and later LAOS party.

What does that even mean? 

&gt;a three-year period for meeting the ""1/20th-debt-rule"", following the correction of the excessive deficit. 

So, basically, no country have to start to reduce their debt before 2014? 

&gt; But one thing that comes to mind is that bailout conditions needn't be the same as the stability pact conditions.

True, I didn't think about that. But still, Greece haven't really complied with anything, and their debt is rising, as well. If it rises in 2014, will they go in and punish them? 

Honestly, I'll believe the punishing and the fines when I see it, which will not be (they made sure of that) before 2014. 

I would also consider it ridicoulous if the Netherlands (just as an example)were punished for increasing their debt, while Italy might get away with it, just because their debt is not rising anymore. Perhaps one of the reasons it is not rising is that the ECB is pumping in billions of the taxpayers money into Italy. Shouldn't the Netherlands get the same preferential treatment then?  

The problem is, countries are not treated the same and they are still not following the rules (in this case, do not aid individual countries, no country have to help another etc, but these rules are ECB rules, not the stability pact).

There a couple of fairly obvious answers to what you have just said, Portugal has been ruled by inept, corrupt and self-interested groups for decades. Not only that, but there's a significant gap in the level of education between Portugal and Sweden (with several implications). The upcoming generation would most likely ameliorate this caveat, but, as luck would have it, most graduates and skilled laborers are jumping ship at an alarming pace. This might lead to a very dangerous situation, unless these new emigrants are fond of sending remittances back home (family ties are relatively different nowadays). You see, it's possible that Portugal, a relatively poor country in Western European terms, will end up subsidizing the human capital of other countries, while being saddled with debt and with very little to show for it.

It's not that the level of taxation will have achieved a magical and unsustainable point, but rather that the country has a very small margin to work with to begin, as has been pointed out. It's absolutely true that either public expenditure needs to be restructured or revenues must increase, but the latter has kick-started this dangerous brain drain effect.

The troika's job is indeed to get public expenses back to a sustainable level, while the government should aim for the same while simultaneously maintaining national interest at heart. Traditionally, the various governments have postponed all kinds of reforms until the bitter end. The structure of the state is mired by powerful interest groups that will not allow anything to change unless absolutely necessary (see the failure to deal with public-private partnerships, a broken electoral system, a cumbersome and expensive municipal make-up, private workers with access to unexplainable and ridiculously high public subsidies, etc). Apparently, this point is yet to be reached, but keep in mind that only the bare minimum will ever be acceptable. The biggest opposition party, for example, wanted to scale back on tax increases and spending cuts for the previous year as they considered that ""there was room for maneuver"".

That said, you'll be hard pressed to find popular support for the Troika, despite my previous statement. So, let's not mix things up. The Troika and the bailout were born out of aligning self-interests and are not a reflection of solidarity or altruism. The Troika's obsessive concern with the bottom-line lines-up perfectly with the status quo of those in power.
This is, unfortunately, part of the problem. 

Not to forget that Portugal's public expenditure binge in the past decade was fueled, partially, by EU funds (declining projects would mean that funding would have to be returned) and a mandate for infrastructure build-up (unfortunately, this resulted in little more than a myriad of useless and, most importantly, unproductive motorways) that very easily leads to corrupt deals (as it did). 

Even disregarding the obviously untrue campaign platform, the current prime minister is an opportunist and lacks any kind of credibility. The guy managed to reject an austerity package that led to the previous (terrible) government's fall. This resulted in months of paralysis while debt accumulated as interest rates soared and expenditure remained constant. But, hey, at least he won the elections. That was worth it, right? To sum it up, Portuguese politics can be resumed in one sentence: a binary seat of power, for cosmetic reasons, that serves as a figurehead for monolithic interest groups.

Now, you tell me, is the government going to bite the hand that feeds?

Why did I bother going on a rant about the power distribution in Portugal? Because it pertains to just how broken the electoral system actually is and due to the fact that the alternating seat of power is an extremely powerful tool of smoke and mirrors. People rage about the current government and vote en masse for the analogous party with a slightly different rhetoric but same government plan, despite the recurring feeling of deja vu.

No, it does not, and this is not a generalization but a prejudice.

- Where I'm from, anyone east of Germany is considered mentally challenged and emotionally unstable.

Really? I doubt that this is really true, where are you from?

- Generalisations are, when applied to ethnicities and nationalities, worthless and harmful.

That's not true. They are definitely not worthless, for example when a girl travels to countries like Saudi Arabia or Oman she's not advised to wear shorts or skirts there. Why? Because people there tend to be really religious and she might get into trouble. Does it mean they are all really religious? No. Was it a generalization? Yes.

Go to ""consumidores domésticos"". As you can see, the graphic says 36% is ""energia"". 

Let's assume ""energia"" is simply the cost of consumed electricity. That's already 1/3 of the bill. 

Well, the graphic doesn't factor in the VAT, so let's take away the VAT (23%) out of the 36%. That leaves us with 27,72%. We're getting near that 1/5 ratio I mentioned above. That's 1/4 of the bill.

But hold on now, the graphic doesn't factor in the audiovisual tax, the operator's tax, the regulator's tax and the VAT, and it also doesn't elaborate on what ""energia"" actually is. 

On page 1, the document just says ""energia"" includes the ""costs of comercialization"". What this actually means is that ""energia"" is the price of electricity as defined by the Iberian gross market plus added costs of distribution and operating (operator's tax, which is shared with the ""redes"" slice of the graphic). The audiovisual tax and the regulator's tax aren't included in that document/graphic, because those are deemed as taxes outside of the electricity market and dependent on the state (like VAT).

And no one was attacking the protesters because they weren't French. It all has to do with religious zeal which has no place in a secular country like France. I would also point out to desullen that racism isn't the issue here either, as Muslims are not a race.

**Arranged marriage is principially legitimate**

Cultural minister Hadia Tajik is of the opinion that arranged marriages are principially just as legitimate as falling in love. But points out that there are great challenges.

By Helene Kleppe, 29.9.2012 10:49

— Principially I think that arranging marriages is just as legitimate as falling in love and getting married that way. However, it involves greater challenges than many Norwegian-Pakistanis will accept, and it's quite problematic to arrange a marriage between someone who grew up in Norway and one from, say, Pakistan. The tradition is closely related to traditional gender role patterns. As a 29-year-old, I don't imagine this happening for myself, says cultural minister Hadia Tajik to DN.

Tajik denies that she is an immigrant hero. She grew up in Bjørnheimsbygt in Rogaland. The Tajik family, who ran ""Ali groceries"" were the only immigrants.

— Growing up in such a small place gave me some Norwegian social cultural codes for free. You realise quite quickly that you eat Kvikklunsj on a hiking trip, not After Eight. But of course, you are different, I felt that, says Tajik in the interview.

We do not protect those who make threats. We arrest them.

Since I'm getting quite tired of this debate, I will say one thing: it all comes down to this. In accordance with Serbian law and Constitution, all public gatherings in public places must be previously approved with police. Police will approve of these gatherings only if there is no threat to the security. Police has, in past, banned many, MANY gatherings precisely for these reasons - because it will threaten the overall security, whether directly or indirectly.

The police must follow the law. When the LGBT organization in Serbia submitted their request, the police has deemed the event to risky as it would cause violence. Therefore, it has been banned. No, the pride parade has not been banned - all public gatherings for that day have been banned, everywhere in Belgrade. 

The LGBT members are more than welcome to organize an awareness walk in downtown Belgrade, as long as they don't obstruct the laws (i.e. they don't walk on the streets, but only on sidewalk/pedestrian zones).

I was hyperbolizing the part where I said ""oh look, here's 5 billion"". Since I was being extremely sarcastic, I wanted to say that we don't have a single cent left. A month ago it was even a problem to pay all the salaries. The government has to borrow billions.

They donated 1 billion euros in 5 years, which is 200 million per year, but that does not go to our budget. We don't receive ANY money from the EU directly into our budget. Instead, they invest that money. And asking the EU for help, I cringed at that statement. The EU is not exactly in great shape economically by itself now, they have more pressing issues themselves, and we'd ask them to build prisons in Serbia? Are you serious?

Selling Telekom: first that would be a horrible idea in itself; second, even if we did sell it, we have far more pressing issues to spend that money on than to build prisons. I'd MUCH rather have that money spent on some investments that will yield a return over time. 

The new Belgrade bridge did not cost 400 million, funny that you say that. Its cost was 120 million euros - the 400 million figure is an estimate of the entire inner traffic ring in Belgrade, which includes trains, part of subway, new tram lines, a 6 lane highway and much more. We can't even begin to fathom that because we can't find the money.

No, there's no money to be found if we really wanted it. And even if we did find some money, there are far more pressing issues to address - I would argue that, for example, basic hospital equipment has a much higher priority than prisons. Pensions are guaranteed by law and we cannot choose not to pay them off.

true,[deleted],null,null,"**John has it very good** - why the heck is a minimum wage person supposed to have an apartment on his own?! It is completely crazy!

Here in Vienna which is considered a good place, he would earn €1000 for a minimum-wage-ish job like call center or cleaning rooms, and fork over €450-€500 for an apartment if he would be stupid enough to do so - but instead, either he has a GF who makes the same money or he lives in a houseshare, renting only a room for €250-300. 

Wait... you just said it is 160% of the minimum wage. Not minimum wage. OK. Weird. In my mind call center is a very low job. OK it is a bit different - but I am not sure someone taking home €1600 (which would never be a call center employee, more like a programmer with 6-8 years of experience) here would still want to spend €500 on an apartment. People living alone don't need an apartment, period, they need a room.

Let John live with a GF making minimum wage in that apartment or let him live in a €200 room and it looks much better.

John doesn't really need vacations abroad because he is already living in a country that is a vacation destination, has it all, sun, beach, sea (ocean). He just needs to have grandma who happens to have a cottage near the beach and he can vacation for free. Right? 

Essetially speaking I think the normal life begins when John is promoted to a manager and marries a girl working in a call center. This is where things like a car, vacations abroad etc. become realistic.

I think your expectations are a bit too high. The lifestyle you decribed is worse but not radically worse than the no-crisis countries like Austria. 

And the real crisis ones? In Hungary John would not even find a job or would make €500 at the call center and an apartment would be €300 and he would never think moving away from his parents unless he really gets lucky and starts a succesful business. Or works abroad to  save money. And it was before the crisis so. People without a good job like lawyer were never expected to be make a living without living with parents or something in the last 20 years. My in-laws in Hungary live 3 generations under one roof, each adding his tiny €300 salary to the common budget. And this is not a crisis, this was the normal since forever.

yeah, I don't think the SGP mechanisms can do much in the middle of the crisis. Its even dubious how much continent-wide fiscal tightening is even effective - because it might dampen the growth so much that one ends up with a hole in the budget anyhow.

What I do hope is that it might be useful in the future, so that one avoids ending up in this situation in the first place, and/or so that if someone does end up in trouble in the future, it will be an exception, and not half the continent.

And at times the police are turning a blind eye or even helping the Golden Dawn. Recognize the difference, and know that these anti fascists are the heroes protecting the innocent. 

[here is a study] (http://www.hrw.org/node/108554/section/2/) showing that Golden Dawn is racist and violent, which is way different than being
&gt;""intolerant to those who don't share their views"". 

in fact, everyone should be intolerant of racists.

Schweigen auf ein kaufmännisches Bestätigungsschreiben:
Im Rahmen von Handelsgeschäften zwischen Kaufleuten kommt dem Schweigen eine stärkere Bedeutung zu. Dem im HGB nicht ausdrücklich geregelten kaufmännischen Bestätigungsschreiben muss ein Kaufmann unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen unverzüglich widersprechen, wenn er den Inhalt dieses Schreibens nicht gegen sich gelten lassen will. Reagiert er nicht auf ein kaufmännisches Bestätigungsschreiben und schweigt, so darf dies als Annahme gewertet werden.[15]
Schweigen des Kaufmanns auf ein Angebot:
Die Regelung des § 362 HGB gilt nur gegenüber Kaufleuten. Hiernach gilt Schweigen auf das Angebot als Annahme, auch im Rahmen von Handelsbräuchen ist Schweigen als Annahme zu werten. Innerhalb einer kaufmännischen Geschäftsbeziehung oder bei einer Aufforderung des Kaufmanns zur Abgabe eines Angebots werden dem Kaufmann besondere Pflichten auferlegt. Er muss auf das Angebot reagieren, sonst gilt sein Schweigen als Annahme. Die Vorschrift kennt zwei Varianten:
1) § 362 Satz 1 HGB (Angebot innerhalb ständiger Geschäftsbeziehung):
Das vom Kaufmann betriebene Handelsgewerbe muss die Besorgung von Geschäften für andere mit sich bringen. Erfasst hiervon werden die Handelsgeschäfte Kommission, Spedition, Lager- und Frachtgeschäft, Makler- und Treuhandverträge sowie insbesondere Bank- und Börsengeschäfte.[16] Zudem muss der dem Kaufmann gemachte Antrag eine solche Geschäftsbesorgung zum Inhalt haben. Ferner ist eine ständige Geschäftsbeziehung zwischen dem Kaufmann und dem Antragenden erforderlich. Diese liegt vor, wenn unter Kaufleuten eine Reihe von rechtsgeschäftlichen Kontakten erfolgt ist und eine Übereinstimmung besteht, fortgesetzt Geschäfte miteinander abzuschließen.[17]
2) § 362 Satz 2 HGB (Aufforderung zur Abgabe eines Angebots; „invitatio ad offerendum”):
Der erforderliche Antrag auf Besorgung eines Geschäftes entspricht dem des § 362 Satz 1 HGB. Statt dem besonderen Gegenstand es Handelsgewerbes und der ständigen Geschäftsbeziehung ist ein Anbieten der Geschäftsbesorgung gegenüber dem Antragenden erforderlich. Darunter ist eine invitatio ad offerendum zu verstehen, die allerdings individuell und nicht an einen unbestimmten Personenkreis („ad incertas personas“) gerichtet sein muss. Ansonsten wäre nämlich jedes Angebot auf eine Werbung ein Fall des § 362 HGB.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  I mean what are the ""old Berliner"" used to

Berlin used to have ridiculously low rents, not just compared to other major European cities, but even relative to smaller ones within Germany.  
Now several things are happening in parallel. Real estate prices in Germany go up across the board -- German capital is coming ""home"" and other European capital flows to Germany on top of it. Real estate is considered ""inflation proof"", and housing prices here haven't kept up with the boom elsewhere. Instead, they had [remained stable](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/11/global-house-prices) for the past two decades. Now, they're slowly catching up, because all that money has to go somewhere, and in Berlin this is happening faster than elsewhere. None the less, people from Munich or Frankfurt would have a hard time understanding what those Berliners are complaining about.

But that's not all. Some parts of Berlin experience gentrification. It's the normal cycle -- parts of the city where rent is cheap attract students, small galleries, bars and cafés, and they become trendy. They become ""in"", and go from alternative to hip and attractive. More people move there to be ""a part of it"", and rents go up. Then creative types who ""love the atmosphere"" and have cash to spend buy into it, and apartments get renovated to accommodate them, which drives up rent further. In some parts of Berlin, both effects are happening at the same time, gentrification on top of the overall price increases.  
The problem with this is that this means that housing is priced out of the range of the original crowd that had originally given the quarter its character and made it attractive in the first place. Understandably, they complain.  

What makes Berlin stand out is that, in a way, this gentrification cycle applies both to parts of the city especially, and to the city as a whole. That is, if Germany was a city, Berlin used to be the cool hip -- and cheap -- part of it that is now getting gentrified.

Meanwhile, people from Munich don't understand what all the fuzz is about.

They're not really rich, they just have a higher income than the students and so on that live there. Remember, the scene had moved to those parts of the city because rent was cheap. At least early on in the cycle, those parts have still cheaper rent than elsewhere, then the normal level, eventually maybe a bit more but still affordable if you have a steady job with an average salary.  
So, it's not that those parts of the city suddenly become exceptionally expensive. But if you work the occasional odd job or are a student, it makes a huge difference when rooms cost €100/month more than they used to just three or four years before.

true,___alt,ZZZZZZcoq,Coq,"&gt; Why is it that France never takes those who wish to harm her seriously?

This crappy paper is not even serious in the first place. You don't take nutjobs seriously unless they can do real harm. Toilet-paper journalism is not a threat.

&gt; Imagine similar words aimed at Israel instead of France. Israeli lobbies would loose their minds!

So because some people are not able to act cool-headed on some issues, we should do the same ? This is nonsense.

&gt; But when you see too many new religious buildings popping up in a fairly secular country, especially those of some newly imported foreign religion, it should ring some bells. 

The problem is not really islam itself, since France is a secular country and this is not going to change anytime soon. This is more like an integration issue.  And this is a real, important issue with a lot of ramifications, one of them being the religious issue.

&gt; There are many indications that Muslims are utilising laws that are meant to safeguard secular freedoms, in order (in some bizarre ironical twist) to try and slowly-but-surely transform the country into some Islamic theocracy.

This is not what's happening right now in France, as far as I know. This has been a major thesis from the Front National for the last decade, that french society was getting invaded by islam and it was dangerous. A transformation is probably happening in all the sordid ghettos that exist in this country, but french society as a whole hasn't changed.

&gt; The foreign press, in the meantime, accuses France of being both Islamophobically fascistic (against Muslims and right-wing) AND Islamofascistically phobic (pro-Muslim and afraid) often within the same publications (and even the same article). To be anti-French without rhyme or reason is considered OK, even humorous, in the USA. As for Israel, we can see here that to foam at the mouth with vitriolic hatred of France (in between articles on anti-Semitism, of course) is considered perfectly all right for their press.

We the fuck should we care about those people ? Are they at war with us ? Bombing us ? Are they threatening ? Do they have any moral authority over anything ? Why bother ? If you start to take offense at what every nutjob in this world is going to write or say, you may as well kill yourself on the spot because it's not going to be a pleasant experience.

&gt; But we should all ... just laugh. There's no need to be offended by anything!

Yes. Only stupid people get offended for any kind of reason. Being offended is not a right, it's not clever, it doesn't do you any favor.

You gotta decide what you want to say before you say it. This differs from being ""mentally chalenged"" eh? Lazy?

A lady from my hometown was married as a result of one of these arranged meetings, a married couple she knew invited her and the man they thought might suit her for dinner along with some other people. The married couple didn't tell either him or her beforehand of their intentions though, but as it turned out these two got along really well, started dating and were eventually married. Without the married couple that got them together they would have never met so they were thankful towards them.

It's not massively common, but sometimes if someone has a good single friend they might want for them to meet someone and enjoy that type of happiness, so they might arrange for them to meet a number of their other single friends of the appropriate gender. These pairing attempts may sometimes result in awkwardness though and may or may not be welcomed.

Arranged marriages are sort of a more overt form of the usually more subtle western style pairing attempts.

Connaître nos institutions me paraît absolument nécessaire quand on vient critiquer ses représentants (de tous les bords). 
La critique d'un représentant de l'état, quelque soit le degré de connerie dont il fait preuve, n'est pas légitime si vous ne savez même pas comment et par qui il est élu. 
Alors voici comment se passe les élections municipales en France :

""Les membres des conseils municipaux sont élus au suffrage universel direct pour un mandat de 6 ans renouvelable dans le cadre de la commune. Le mode de scrutin utilisé pour cette consultation n'est pas uniforme sur l'ensemble du territoire. Il diffère selon la population des communes considérées. Il y a lieu, à cet égard, de distinguer les communes de moins de 3 500 habitants, les communes de 3 500 habitants et plus, et les villes de Paris, Lyon, et Marseille soumises à des dispositions spécifiques.

- Les communes de moins de 3 500 habitants :

Les membres des conseils municipaux sont élus au scrutin majoritaire. Au premier tour, la majorité absolue est requise ainsi que le quart des électeurs inscrits. Pour être élu au second la majorité relative suffit.

Les candidats se présentent en listes complètes (sauf pour les communes de moins de 2 500 habitants où les candidatures isolées et les listes incomplètes sont autorisées) et les suffrages sont comptabilisés individuellement. En outre le panachage est autorisé.

- Les communes de 3 500 habitants et plus :

Le mode de scrutin applicable est le scrutin de liste à deux tours, avec dépôt de listes complètes, sans aucune modification possible de la liste par l'électeur.

Si une liste obtient la majorité absolue au premier tour, il lui est attribuée un nombre de sièges égal à la moitié des sièges à pourvoir. Les autres sièges sont répartis entre toutes les listes à la représentation proportionnelle à la plus forte moyenne. Dans le cas contraire, il est procédé à un second tour.

Au second tour, seules peuvent se présenter les listes ayant obtenu 10% des suffrages exprimés. Un candidat peut figurer sur une autre liste à condition qu 'elle ait obtenu au moins 5% des suffrages exprimés, et qu'elle ne se présente pas. En ce cas l'ordre de présentation des candidats peut être modifié.

Il est attribué à la liste qui obtient le plus de voix, un nombre de sièges égal à la moitié des sièges à pourvoir. Les autres sièges sont répartis entre toutes les listes à la représentation proportionnelle à la plus forte moyenne.

- Les régimes particuliers de Paris, Marseille et Lyon :

Les règles sont les mêmes que pour les communes de 3 500 habitants et plus mais l'élection se fait par secteur. A Paris et à Lyon, chaque arrondissement forme un secteur. A Marseille, il existe 8 secteurs de 2 arrondissements chacun. Les sièges de membres du conseil de Paris ou du conseil municipal de Marseille ou de Lyon sont donc attribués au regard des résultats obtenus par secteur et selon les mêmes règles que pour les communes de 3 500 habitants et plus. Des conseillers d'arrondissement sont, en outre, élus en même temps que les membres du Conseil de Paris et des conseils municipaux de Marseille et de Lyon. Les sièges sont répartis dans les mêmes conditions entre les listes.

- L'élection du maire et des adjoints (MAJ février 2008):

L'élection du maire est faite par le conseil municipal qui se réunit au plus tôt le vendredi et au plus tard le dimanche qui suit l'élection du conseil au complet.

Pour être élu maire, il faut obtenir la majorité absolue des suffrages exprimés au deux premiers tours. Si après deux tours, aucun candidat n'a obtenu la majorité, on procède à un troisième tour et l'élection a lieu à la majorité relative.

Après l'élection du maire, le conseil municipal fixe par délibération, le nombre des adjoints (au maximum 30% de l'effectif légal du conseil municipal) puis procède à leur élection.""

Could you please give some examples ? I know that delusional thinking has done a lot of harm in France in the past (WW2 being full of stories about this, from the invasion of Poland to the Ligne Maginot), but it's not akin to ignoring hateful people writing in foreign newspapers.

&gt; When someone attacks you (verbally or physically) you must immediately reply in kind, hard and fast.  You must do so regardless of whether he represents a serious enough danger.

No, you don't. Sometimes you should, sometimes not. Reaction should be proportionate to the threat in all circumstances. Reacting strongly to any form of attacks is something that a terrorist would want you to do.

&gt;  Very often, by the time it is absolutely clear that those who act against you represent a serious danger, it's basically too late to do anything about it.

This is a very broad statement, that also may be true sometimes. Or not. On the ""angry newspaper"" articles front, there's no urge nor hurry to react. There may not even be a need to react.

&gt; Also, you cannot assume the same 'highness in spirit' (so to speak) in others that you may find in yourself. 

True.

&gt; Others (almost all others) use 'being offended"" as a kind of weapon to silence (even legitimate) criticism. Are they all being lowly and stupid and we so noble and intelligent? I don't know. 

You're right about one thing for the ""being offended"" state of mind. It has two faces. One is ignorance, the other is manipulation. The murderer of an ambassador or carefully planed protests in Iran against the infamous ""Innocence of Muslims"" video is clearly a good case of manipulation. Other protests took place under the sign of ignorance.

How about you take my life as a example as well I and also portugues on paper, although I don't think their is any noble blood or lands.
As for no right to goverment help ...well I certainly hope you are getting nothing if you have your own place and are earning 1000 or 800€.

As for many ""poor"" people that have lost thier homes taken by the banks. You serious , that is your definition of poor? consediring that the portuguese family was indebted in over 100% due to loans for everything from house, car, furniture to vacation trips.

As for John's sucide well at least the entitled jerk is letting others have treatment earlier.

The problem with Portuguese people and politics is that no one whats to face facts and the truth. When a quater of the parlament (the left, PCP and BE) thinks that getting out of the EU and the Euro is the solution to every problem. By problem I mean everything from this crisis to global warming to the stubed toe one of them got in the year of 1967.

The facts are simple really and the expanation is even simpler.
The Civil service has a department called...SUPERNUMERARY Dept. which existe with the sole purpose of collecting civil service employees that do NOTHING and can't be fired by law. They do nothing because they can't or refuse to be retrained or what ever reason under the sun you care to name.

Yes that is the mentallity that existe in Portugal that the portuguese accept this as normal!!

So honestly as a Portuguese I'm very sorry for those that are having dificulties but..... Fuck John and his entitled whining, he has it good.

I did not say ignore them I said they have no power or even a snowballs chance in hell of having a effect.
I do listen to their opinion and do agree with them that life is hard that the taxs are high and etc. However I do also notice that none of the oposition parties have stepped foward with valid alternatives.
Proof of that was this weeks ""Show"" by PCP and BE. They presented a motion of censure in the parlament with full knowlegde that even PS (the main oposition party) would not support it.

You point was that poor John was getting the shaft by the goverment and we should pity him and try to understand and help poor John. 
As for home ownership...Try this..http://www.housingeurope.eu/www.housingeurope.eu/uploads/file_/HER%202012%20EN%20web2_1.pdf

&gt;What would you then describe as the ""reality with must face""?

How about the fact that we have been running a deficit for years. 
How about the fact that money just doesn't show up, that the goverment borrows money to pay for salaries and services, for all that entitlement culture.

How about the simple and recent fact that the recent bailout by IMF, the EU and the BCE never promise to save our economy. The help was only the promise to finance the Portuguese goverment at a reduce interest rate for a while before we had to return to the market place for our loans.

Would you loan money to a homeless person that reaked of alcohol who promised to be sober and use the money for food? No you would I hope pay for his food your self if you had any sense at all.

So yes facing facts is recognizing the reallity that we will have to pay back what we own if we are smart. 

If however we listen to PCP or BE that just irresponsably say denounce the treaty and leave the EU and the Euro. Convince that if that happens others will keep on lending us money or that we will just be able to print money again.

Or we can listen to PS the oposition party which signed the treaty. They want to renegociate the treaty they created in the first place now. Yes now thing are different from before they claim. 
But interestingly enough they did not vote in favor of the motion of censure but will vote against the Goverment budget. 
Cowards they want to be able to say tsk tsk but will not step fopward and offer a alternative.

As for perspective how about this. 
Once upon a time I went to the Social Security office to get a filing for work. When I was waiting for said file I over hear this.
A man on the next counter asked the social sercurity worker how he could get his employer to fire him without cause so that he could still collect unemployment and his compensation. This after getting the day off from work from his boss.

This is the Portugal we live in and that is finally starting to change. 
So yes poor John he is suffering for the sins of the past but in the real world the son does pay for the sins of the father.

Un des commentaires marrant que j'ai lu: ""supprimons le thermomètre, la fièvre disparaitra !""

Je trouve l'analogie très adaptée: supprimer la note ne supprime pas le ""problème"", mais supprime la visibilité que l'on a dessus, et si on veut garder cette visibilité, il faut alors prendre la température avec autre chose qu'un thermomètre en degrés Celsius.

En allant encore plus loin: ""En cours d'acquisition"", ""acquis"", ou ""expert"" ça revient à avoir un thermomètre avec ""froid"", ""tiède"", ou ""chaud"", c'est moins précis, mais personne n'est dupe: le froid se sentira plus à la ramasse que le chaud ou le tiède quand même.

Mais le fond du problème selon moi, et ça se ressent de plus en plus rien qu'en écoutant/lisant ce qui se fait comme proposition, c'est qu'on considère que c'est un jeu à deux acteurs: les élèves et les enseignants... et les parents dans le lot ?

Pour autant que je me souvienne, quand j'avais une sale note les miens étaient pas trop contents, et j’étais déçu qu'ils soient déçus, c'est con mais simple comme système, et même si l'objectif de satisfaire papa ou maman ça a pas l'air légitime ou réellement important à long terme (et effectivement c'est pas ça qui compte), peu importe: pour un enfant/adolescent c'est plus perceptible et compréhensible que le concept d’échec scolaire (et professionnel par extension).

Well, yes and no.  Montenegro, Kosovo, San Marino and others use the Euro informally, but they cannot create euros, so their banks can only lend out to within the limit of their central bank's euro reserves (if I understand correctly how the setup works), something which might be adequate for small economies but not one as dynamic as Catalonia's (as for Andorra and Monaco, they don't even have a central bank).  Other countries peg their currency to the euro, something Catalonia could always do, of course, but that's not the same thing (and if the breakup with Spain is really unfriendly, the new central bank of Catalonia might have initially no external reserves whatsoever with which to defend its currency).

wpierdolić: to eat sth, to beat sb up, to put sth in another thing  
napierdolić: to get wasted, to put a lot of things on sth
