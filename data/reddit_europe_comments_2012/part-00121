true,yourslice,null,null,"&gt;Then why did he champion a reform that requires insurance companies to apply 80-85% of your premium payments to actual health care instead of profit or advertising?

If something seems too good to be true it usually is.  The healthcare corporations were guaranteed millions of new customers under the new law, which will more than make up for any profits lost.  Meanwhile, the smaller healthcare companies will not be able to compete due to this very part of the law.  The bigger corporations know this, and will enjoy having less competition.  

By the way, single-payer would result in 100% payout and administrative costs, and 0% profit and advertising.  But that wasn't even discussed.  

&gt;Why has he made it easier for students to get loans?

Higher education is an industry in our country.  Students get an education, but they also gets saddled with debt.  Meanwhile, the schools are making killer profits.  The more government involves itself with student loans, the more the schools make.  It would be much better to have publicly funded schools, or completely free-market schools.  This government private mix has led to our schools being some of the most expensive in the world.  

&gt;Let me ask you this: do you think any president could govern while ignoring the needs of large banks and corporations?

The real problem is how our elections are financed.  If we didn't have ""citizens united"" and if we didn't have politicians that were bought and paid for, they would represent the needs of the people first.  But under current conditions politicians are for sale to the highest bidder.  

&gt;Do you think people like you and I would do well if banks weren't loaning money and jobs weren't kept and created in America?

Well that's funny because the banks haven't been lending all that much money in the last 5 years, even after the trillion dollar bank bailout not to mention all of the easy money the fed has been feeding them.  

I think bad corporations should go out of business.  I think our car companies made shitty cars in the past few decades and it made sense that nobody was buying them.  The market is supposed to award companies when they give people a product that they want, and it's supposed to punish companies that do the opposite.  If GM had gone under, that would have been the end to GM but not a permanent end to car manufacturing in this country.  It makes sense to build cars in the US.  The factories and equipment would have been here, and could have been sold to another company and they probably would have done a better job.  With success, that would open the door to even more jobs.  That's how the market works.  

&gt;Policies can benefit both business and ordinary people; the two are not mutually exclusive. 

I agree completely.  But it shouldn't be the government's role to pick winners and losers, especially in the business world.  Government's role should be to give us all an even playing field.  

&gt;There is also nothing wrong with running a business and trying to make a profit.

Of course not!  But there is something very wrong when you are depending on the government to give you unearned profits.  

&gt;The cash came with restructuring requirements. It wasn't free

It was a handout.  Corporate welfare.  Yes, it had some small print attached to it, but it was still welfare for a giant sucky corporation.  

&gt;and if those jobs had been lost, they wouldn't have been replaced by new American companies. They would have been gone for good.

You can't prove that.  American car corporations have been outsourcing jobs for many years now (see Roger &amp; Me) while in the last decade foreign car companies have been building plants in this country.  If GM had died, who knows who would have stepped in to take their place?

&gt;Which rights and how?

Which rights has Obama violated?  Off of the top of my head: He voted to renew the Patriot Act before coming President and then as President he renewed it (twice I believe).  He has continued the practice of government agents listening to our phone calls and reading our e-mails without a warrant.  He is closing down marijuana distributorships which are legal under state law, thereby violating the 10th amendment.  He has kept gitmo open, breaking a campaign promise, and preventing the universal right to a trial for some who are imprisoned there (indefinite detention).  He suspended Habeas Corpus.  Not a pretty record.  

&gt;By ending the Iraq War and trying to prevent war with Iran?

The war has NOT ended in Iraq.  If it were over, all of our troops would be home.  Also, Obama has said repeatedly that he will not allow Iran to possess nuclear weapons, which means he will attack them if they continue to pursue them.  He also refuses to take a nuclear first strike off of the table, which is ridiculous.  

At any rate, Obama has bombed 7 countries since taking office: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia and Libya.  He has also deployed US troops to Uganda.  That is a record of massive foreign intervention.  ",0,1347090943,null,0,1347129719,0,c6572i5,t3_zhzl4,t1_c6572i5,t1_c655p48,null,1429847402,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The members of the Greek police force, following the fall of the (proven to have been CIA-backed) dictatorship in 73, were not replaced with a new, fresh force staffed with democratically-minded policemen. Instead much of the same people carried on with the jobs, as they saw them.

Even 40 years on, particularly because of the nepotism in Greece (the son takes the job of his father, etc), the force is still largely extremely faschist, much more so than I have experienced in any other of the several big european cities that I have lived.

For example, a common sight in the center of Athens, is a riot police van, with a neo-nazi newspaper on display by the dashboard beind the drivers window, advertising the political beliefs of the force.

I am not against the police force per se, as an instrument serving society.

true,cpt_lulz,null,null,"Basically, as u/nicasucio pointed out, Greece is Europe's doorstep for many immigrants, just like Italy or Spain.

It gets a bit more complex from there. All the EU states have signed the [Dublin Convention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Convention), which basically states that every refugee must be taken care of at his point of entry to the EU... and by taken care they originally mean ""be treated according to international law, especially the Geneva Convention granting you some basic rights "". 

Not that anybody wearing an uniform in Greece actually seems to remember that... so the refugees coming from the Middle East as well as Northern Africa way too often imagine the EU as a coherent state (like the USA). They turn to the police and try to get an asylum status as described under the Geneva rules - and they get treated in a manner I can ony describe as inhumane. They get beaten, imprisoned, detained in concentration camps, unaccompanied children do not recieve adequate help and ill people as well as pregnant women are more or less left to survive on their own. 

I am not exaggerating. I was on the ground in 2008, doing research about the asylum crisis in and around Athens. Refugees described their situation more than once along the lines of ""In Afghanistan, the Taliban would at least have killed me with a quick gunshot, bot over here we die slowly..."" - in a slum near the port of Patras, where around 4000 young male refugees (according to the Doctors Without Borders psychologist, the majority suffering from PTSD/depression/suicidal thoughts) try to jump over the port fence and hide in a cargo vessel departing to Italy every day, sometimes for years without success, even if they make it out of Greek territory. Why?

Well, here's the Dublin II twist and the problem Greece faces: those immigrants left their fingerprints with the Greek police when they applied for asylum. Little did they know that the central police office in Athens has two versions of the only official document covering asylum: denied without reason and denied with [insert reason]. In any case, Greece is their point of entry and probably exit from the European Union. You get you asylum case denied in Greece, then you have your case denied anywhere in Europe.

So if they apply for Asylum again in, say, Sweden (with much better chances for asylum seekers to be treated according to their human rights), the local officer will match their fingerprints with the database and will find out that Greece as the 'Point of Entry' has to deal with the refugees, not Sweden/Germany/Austria. So... they mostly get sent back to Greece. They land in Athens with the official verdict of having to leve the country in a few weeks. Case closed.

Nobody wants to go back, as you can imagine. Most of them even can't go back. 

And so they try to escape Greece once more northwestbound. Or they try to stay and earn a living without being able to get a job, since most of them are not accepted under Geneva terms (which would grant them the right to work). Prostitution, theft, black labor, organised crime, you name it. 

The ones I've spoken with were often fluent in English and even had learned a craft or earned a degree in their home country. Teachers, engineers, translators, craftsmen - after all, they had the approx. 6000$ you need to flee to Europe. Some of my contacts the collaborated with ISAF troops in Afghanistan as translators, until their family got killed as a warning. They wanted to work, to show gratitude to their host country...  

Instead, millions of immigrants (amongst them lots of refugees covered by the Geneva convention) get their basic rights denied by the whole of Europe.  

**tl;dr: This is not only a Greek problem but rather a systematical denial of human rights by the EU, and Greece's own problems - geographically, financially, socially - make things even more inhumane and deadly for refugees.**

After operations of FRONTEX in the Mediterranean the passage has been blocked in a big extend. So the waves turned to Turkey and then to Greece through Evros river or to Greece through islands of the Aegean. 

Also, EU law has made Greece into a buffer zone for immigration. With the Dublin II treaty every immigrant that manages to leave for the interior of Europe if he is arrested he must be sent back to the country where he first entered to be dealt with - that is Greece in most cases.

Most immigrants don't want to stay to Greece, they see it a transit country, but they cannot leave easily also, some are exploited by the networks who brought them here in the first place, they try to take permits of stay but in Greek public offices that takes months or even years while at the same time they can be arrested at any time, they apply for asylum but that can also take months and at that time can be also imprisoned to centers of the worst conditions in the borders or elsewhere.

Now think that Greece is now a country deeply in crisis and that it also has to manages the immigration phenomenon as well and you can understand why the neonazis have gained such a following. Most people blame the immigrants for the bad shape of the country, they are the easy scapegoats in a desperate situation. Violence has been accepted by many citizens as a way to deal with these issues and it's an everyday phenomenon especially in the streets of Athens.

In this video, this is the most light of the situation, there are also a lot of beatings and torturing that takes place and, unfortunately, murders - and they are not few in number. Many times the police will turn a blind eye and let these things happen since a lot of policemen support the practices of and/or vote for the Golden Dawn.

The fact they have to deal with violent people is part of every policeman's job anywhere in the world, and does in no way justify the way the Greek police force acts. Advertising neonazi ideals (AND ACTING UPON THEM) just because someone threw a rock at you is the most illogical trail of thought I could ever come up with. Just leave the force and do all of society a favor if you cannot do the job the way it is supposed to be done.

The southern states, while being republican strongholds, are the biggest recievers of federal money paid by the ""blue"" states.
The jobgrowth you are witnessing is because of the increase of minimum wage labor (texas for example) using federal funds from the stimulus pakage of 2010. You can see a lot of european companies investing in the south (cars; siemens etc.), again with the help of huge subsidies.

You do create jobs by investing in education, cultivating a business environment that meets the needs of the owners/investors but also keeps in track with the common good(s) etc.

When it comes to being alone at night in the metro, it all depends on two factors:
1) Your sex. Right when I arrived, I was heading back to my place from a night of sight-seeing, and there was a man harassing a young lady in front me. I intervened and walked the young lady home. She kept on asking me what is the best way to avoid those types of behaviors. Unfortunately, I didn't really have an answer. I suggested maybe taking a bike, or getting off a more distant but safer metro station where there are more people and more lights. My question is, are you a female? If so, when travelling inside the metro, don't sit in an empty cart. If anything, enter to the cart at the very front, closest to the conductor himself. Odds are there might be more people there and if not, the conductor is right next to you.
2) How you conduct yourself. One thing I learned is how you present yourself, your confidence. If you seem nervous, wary, suspicious, or any other type of vulnerable attitude, it's quite an easy thing to pick up and people may be tempted to pursue you. What I do is I plan where I need to go and act casual. I act as if I have lived here my whole entire life and walk with the flow of the crowd. Late at night, I do the same. There may not be a lot of people, but if you keep a fast-pace, confident stride, and have your eyes not wander and seem lost, then your appearance may deter future harassers.

Now, these are not fool-proof. You may most confident person in the whole, regardless of sex. My advice is carry anything on you that you can afford to lose. Simple as that. I am not knowledgeable when it comes to the laws regarding self-defense, but in my book, when you have to defend yourself, you have to defend yourself. If it's a guy harassing you, kick in the groin.

&gt; Another thing, because the metro closes so early, what does everyone do here if they have to get home? Walk, bike, cab?

As you say, walk, bike, cab.  Bike is quite popular since Vélib appeared, and you should consider getting a Vélib subscription; and now there's this car rental service known as Autolib (assuming you don't drink, of course ;-).  There's also an all-night bus service known as ""Noctilien"", though it's a bit seedy.  And there's the cab, which is easier to catch during the night than in the daytime.

But I think many people just either leave in time for the last metro (which is around 1:30AM on Friday and Saturday night, I don't think it's ""so early""), or go to a nightclub and take the *first* metro.

It's very hard, and I'm not necessarily advocating direct intervention. 

The best option: Follow the money!

Who profits from the conditions in those countries? Where do their funds go?

In the way our current financial system is built, there's many layers of abstraction built that effectively disguise what could previously be traced as a direct line of one entity oppressing another.

Now, there's buying stock in an entity that partially owns another entity that likes selling guns to dictatorships. Hard to blame all involved indeed.

Reforming the financial system so that there are fewer such layers of abstraction, so that direct influence can better be traced, is a good direction to follow.

For example, one good way would be boycotting and shutting down tax paradises. There were trillions of dollars hidden away in those according to one calculation i saw a few days ago in an article on reddit...

We could make sure that money flowing in to our countries did not come from tax paradises. And if it did, penalize with the assumption it is dirty money.

In short, those railways were not built for kids to get to school. They were the means through which vast amounts of resources were very rapidly extracted from those countries, without payment. And what is more, may I add that many of the people building those railways left their bones next to the tracks. And they were not westerners.

Once the Central Bank loads up further on Spanish and Italian bonds — it has already bought more than 200 billion euros ($256 billion) of European bonds, including 50 billion euros ($64 billion) from Greece — it will find it very difficult to stop its bond buying even if countries do not keep to their promises of reform. To do so would be a form of suicide, because it could set off market panic and force countries to exit the euro, beginning a process with no clear end. 

So, once the ECB start buying bonds, they can't stop. That means permanent bond buying, also known as permanent transfers. ",0,1347118398,null,0,false,0,c659xc1,t3_zjp9s,t1_c659xc1,t3_zjp9s,null,1429848751,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland," &gt; We did this already and it led us to the mess we are in (wall street pushed for it and than they let their private equity loose). 

Europe is in another mess that is caused by too rigid and restricted market. Starting business is itself hard, and operating one even harder. Who in their right mind wants to start a business in a country were you can't fire employees or firing costs so much money that it can easily take business into bankruptcy.

&gt; The southern states, while being republican strongholds, are the biggest recievers of federal money paid by the ""blue"" states. The jobgrowth you are witnessing is because of the increase of minimum wage labor (texas for example) using federal funds from the stimulus pakage of 2010. You can see a lot of european companies investing in the south (cars; siemens etc.), again with the help of huge subsidies. And no, I don't want to have to work 2-3 jobs to pay my bills.

Would it be better that new industries wouldn't have located into south, but somewhere else, maybe outside the states? And isn't better to work 2-3 jobs than have no job at all?

&gt; You do create jobs by investing in education, cultivating a business environment that meets the needs of the owners/investors but also keeps in track with the common good(s) etc.

Investing into education only brings fruits if it allow industries to grow. Education system must be geared to serve needs of industries. However if there aren't many industries then there is not really much were educated people can go to work. 

Cultivating business environment is of course good, but like I said before, south suffers from legislation and bureaucracy that suffocates entrepreneurship.

&gt; In the end you create jobs by increasing demand... the demand comes from the people (middle class)...to pay for it they need money they no longer have...

In southern Europe there was demand, but this demand was satisfied with imports. That is the reason why balance of payments in many southern countries is in negative. The only way to turn that other way is to export more and you can only export more when you either get foreign direct investments into production, or that you allow entrepreneurs so succeed in your society.",0,1347118676,null,0,false,0,c659z6n,t3_zjp8a,t1_c659z6n,t1_c6580o4,null,1429848774,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

You had a strong state that I bet would have been one of the most (if not THE most) well off ex-communist country after 1990. Instead you have small states like Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia etc. that essentially have no more differences that a person from Miami and a person from California. Nationalism ruined yugoslavia. That being said, I think nationalism in the Macedonian Republic rose after the split, not before, seeing as the split from Serbia was peaceful.

The naming issue is just bullcrap. It should have been named Slavomacedonia from the start. Both sides are fucking ignorant and stupid. Let's be honest, you look like slavs, speak the language, have the same customs. Not that the Greeks have much relation to ancient macedonia either. Sure, 1/2% of the population of Greece/Rep.Macedonia MAY have some ancient macedonian roots waaaaaaay back in the past but if you think that the bloodline goes uninterrupted for 2000+ years... well you're delusional. Same goes for the Greeks and ancient Greece, but that percentage might be like 30% (not direct bloodline, but some relation). Many here are really dark coloured, they are probably left over from the Ottoman times. Some are not pale but not dark either; they are probably the most ""Greek"" of all when it comes to resemblance. There are also many people who have Slav roots seeing as they settled here in the 7th century. That being said, I look German (tall, blonde-blue eyes combo), with the exception of super dense and thick hair which.. holy FUCK I have a lot of hair.. EVERYWHERE. Go figure. 

If I was from your state, I'm not sure I'd ""celebrate"". Heck, I don't even celebrate our independence day, it's a nationalism fest with army and school parades.

We've been able to ""super-charge"" our export industry because we've done pretty much the same thing we now describe the southern states - admittedly over 10 years and not over 3.

We've kept not increasing wages over the last 10 years while basically everybody else had packed at least 30% on top.

This led to less than the 3 % inflation that was allowed in the Maastricht treaty and severely increased our competitiveness, while everyone else was going on a binge of cheap credit.

That we look better now is the *result* of these policies, not the cause.

We *could* argue that we used our influence to keep interest rates at a level that was too low for the southern states to properly handle.

But in no way we ""profited from our currency not increasing in value"". In fact, it's super-easy to counter that: just buy loads of crap and employ people in government jobs you don't really need and see how your currency's value decreases.

The EU is currently the largest market on the planet. It has more people that the US and more money than China.

That in itself is incentive to start and do business here.

And depending on what you actually do, chances are good that all your competitors have the same ""problems"": not being able to fire is most likely just as hard for them as it is for you.

So the playing field is level, at least in that market. If not, simply incorporate where they are.

This may not be true for enterprises that are virtual or non-local, but again, you could simply get your people where you get them the ""cheapest"".

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; The EU is currently the largest market on the planet. It has more people that the US and more money than China. That in itself is incentive to start and do business here.

There is lots of potential in the EU, that is not the problem. The problem is that companies have finite capital. When a business goes into downturn, has to downsize its activities, has to change its business focus, then you need to get rid of employees that you don't any more need, and the cheaper you get rid of them, the more money you have to reinvent and carry yourself over the bad times. 

&gt; And depending on what you actually do, chances are good that all your competitors have the same ""problems"": not being able to fire is most likely just as hard for them as it is for you. So the playing field is level, at least in that market. If not, simply incorporate where they are.

The playing field is not level, we live in global world. When European legislation shoots down entrepreneurs and starts-up straight from the start, it makes sure that we don't have fast growing SMEs, we don't have fast growing new industries. This is exactly the reason why most new technology companies have come from the US, it is because their legislation supports enterprises and entrepreneurs. Even worrying is that countries like China have more new companies and startups that are moving fast to grow and take over the world.

If we don't change legislation in Europe, then we will get behind both the US and China. We don't create new companies and industries, we rely on old, and as those old industries come under pressure of commoditization, either jobs are lost or living standards take a hit.

You lived in peace after WW2 until nationalism rose in the late 80's, where you killed each other for absolutely fucking stupid reasons. Of course Milosevic was what lighted the fire but it wasn't only Serbian nationalism that rose, it was also Croat and Muslims in Bosnia. 

I'm hoping the people will put this all behind them and start realising they have no major differences. Sure, when you compare Slovenia to Macedonia there are some pretty big gaps, but the republics within modern yugoslavia would have parlaments themselves, because the state was federalised. I'm saying this because I actually love the balkans and especially Yugoslavia. It's beautiful and diverse. The only part of it that I haven't visited is Kosovo, and I wouldn't want to either. 

Blaming Milosevic for everything is not the solution either. Correct me if I'm wrong but Milosevic had the support of most serbs, even after the first war. The thing with Yugoslavia is that it wasn't ONLY the leaders, but it was also the people themselves. We are offtopic by the way, since Milosevic didn't care about Macedonia so he let it go without a fight. 

To contribute though, here's a fun fact: Milosevic had actually proposed to the Greek president to split Yugoslavian Macedonia in two, the northern part going to serbia and the lower one to Greece. Thankfully the government wasn't THAT crazy, even though if you ask about it here, a serious amount (if not the majority) of Greeks will probably tell you ""We should have bombed them when we haved the chance. We'd sent 2 fighter jets and it would be ours in no time."" Nationalism is the no.1 factor of destruction in our nice region.

Actually no. It would be if you had a competition on price. But if that were the case, China would have 90% market share (which if might even have, but only in markets that are not quality- or knowledge-based).

And to argue that we benefit when everyone else has been behaving like morons... well, duh.

You can start a company in Europe from any country in the EU. A lot of which have non-existant labor protection. You may not be able to have - say - french employees as they would be subject to french law, but you can certainly have a Romanian, Irish, British company operate in the whole of the EU.

Have you actually looked at California's labor code?

The reason the Bay Area is awash with new enterprises is that these things tend to cluster. You get some people, cash comes along, that attracts people etc.

&gt; For crying out loud, there are only 6 EU countries with higher GDP nominal per capita than the US, the rest are behind, and the gap won't close without strong economic growth.

And the main/only reason for that is that the US can print dollars like they are made of gold. No one else can do that. So *of course* the GDP is higher.

You see Macedonian see themselves as Slavic people as they are, genetically closer to any other Eastern European Slavic people then to ancient Greeks, not descendants of Alexander but proud of him that once had an empire named Macedonia which all started on the territory that is now Greece, Macedonia and Bulgaria. I am thought in school that  'slavomacedonians' accepted the name Macedonians centuries after Alexander during Byzantine Rule. Nothing to do with ancient Macedonians, just territorial identification. And from what I see history thought here does not differ from what you can find on wikipedia regarding Greek history.

 Le cancer : une maladie professionnelle ?
Le mensuel Ça M’intéresse consacre une enquête au lien entre travail et cancer. Les données de l’Institut national de veille sanitaire (InVs) soulignent que chaque année entre 10 000 et 23 000 personnes contractent un cancer d’origine professionnelle. Le Centre international de recherche sur le cancer indique, lui, que 13% des salariés sont exposés à des agents cancérogènes dans leur environnement de travail, un chiffre qui atteint 70% chez les ouvriers. Moins d’un cancer professionnel sur 10 est reconnu comme tel par la Sécurité sociale et indemnisé. Le lien entre cancer et travail est souvent difficile à établir, sauf pour le cancer de l’ethmoïde (nez, sinus) qui est causé par une exposition aux poussières de bois. Par conséquent, des associations de malades se constituent pour prouver le lien existant entre la maladie et la profession exercée par les patients. Toutefois, précise Annie Thébaud-Mony, sociologue spécialiste de la santé au travail et directrice de recherche honoraire à l’Inserm, « les organisations syndicales ne disposent pas de l’expertise nécessaire pour contrer les arguments des industriels qui ont les moyens de financer des programmes de recherche sous leur contrôle. Une stratégie qui leur a permis, pendant des décennies, d’entretenir le déni des maladies associées à une exposition à l’amiante ». (Ça M’intéresse, 01/09)

Et :
Une étude réalisée par le sociologue britannique, David Stuckler de l’université de Cambridge, et publiée dans la revue médicale The British Medical Journal, établit un lien entre la crise et l’augmentation de 8 à 15% du nombre de suicides. La Croix remarque que de tels travaux n’existent pas en France, dans la mesure où ""aucun organisme scientifique centralisant des données sur le suicide"" n’existe. Un appel des médecins et spécialistes des risques psychosociaux a pourtant été lancé pour la mise en place d’un « Observatoire des suicides et des conduites suicidaires ».

In 2009, Germany was home to around 50.000 confirmed asylum cases. Another 35.000 were pending cases with a temporary right to stay. 68.000 persons were living under the so-called 'exceptional leave to remain' - they should be deported back but they have no passport or won't say where they came from. And another 25.000 could not be deported due to circumstances in their country of origin. 

Under 180.000 persons in a well-developed country of 82 million people, with only 50.000 being ""real"" refugees and the rest more or less held in a waiting state... that's not much. 

Very strict laws have 90% of applicants turned down and subsequently deported. The comparatively high number of total refugees that you cite may have its roots in the Balkan Wars, where refugees fled to the West: Austria, Germany etc. - developed andstable countries which should be capable of dealing with refugees... in theory, that is. History has proven the other way, with hate crimes and organised attacks on refugees. 

The post-Balkan Wars refugee situation is different, and Germany, under Dublin II, tries to steer clear of refugees reaching Europe. The main points of entry (airports) are monitored throughly. And the (in)official policy is 'take as few as possible'. Which leads to Human Rights abuses, too - but Greece is far worse.

If you're looking for just a big black (American style?) coffee with a lot of caffeine, a good quality alternative is to go to an Italian style café (with Italians working there) dotted all around Dublin and order a large Americano with an extra shot of espresso in it. 

The Irish franchises like [Cafe Sol](http://www.cafesol.ie) and [Insomnia](http://insomnia.ie/) will give you stronger coffee (super strength latté has 6 shots of espresso in it...) but IMHO they don't taste quite as good.

I have had people volunteer the craziest comments about jews - as if we were responsible for the banks, weapons - and all of the war in the middle east. When I was out and naively discussed my family background - the topic switched to how difficult things are for  palestinians (and I agree!).  I then suddenly became responsible for the actions of the israel gov't..  all of this was delivered with a polished with excessive try-hard phoney politeness.  

Now I grew up in the southern USA - I would always feel a bit disgusted when I would see a white-boy who thought of himself as ""educated"" try to talk to a black guy with this kind of patronizing phoney excessive friendliness.. and this is what it most reminds me of!  My feeling is that, underneath the polite coating, lies a burning hatred.  When one is in school here - one learns (implicitly, of course) that one must be ashamed to be german because two generations ago, *some* germans committed the greatest and most heinous crime in recorded history.

also the police protection thing is REAL and I find it very disturbing.  Also there are legal restrictions in germany on display of nazi symbolism. Why is it necessary to make nazi symbols illegal?  Presumably because lots of people would otherwise be wearing swastika t-shirts!

true,[deleted],null,null,"Good question. First of all let me say that it's not only anarchists in Greece that oppose the fascists and racism in general, the whole left space of Greece (which is a big part of society albeit they are divided in many parties and small groups which can also hold strong grudges against each other) oppose the fascists. But they do so in a passive or not offensive way (i.e. fighting them in the streets). 

There is an antifascist movement and an anti-racist one that voices its rhetoric quite strongly but also practically supports and helps immigrants in various ways (festivals, squats, places of solidarity, food, health, education, help with legal issues, etc). For the most part however they won't attack the fascists (until now anyway). 

Now the anarchists, which are the ones that you would except them to be more militant about it, haven't done a lot yet. Although some attacks have taken place (like the one in offices of Golden Dawn in Patra recently) there aren't many things going on. My interpretation is this: Golden Dawn has now a great advantage in numbers. While the anarchist movement (in Athens mostly, Thessaloniki also and in a lesser extend in other smaller cities) is famous and strong it doesn't really comprises of that many people as you would think. 

There was a time when Golden Dawn wouldn't crawl out of their holes (when they got something like 0,x%), they were afraid of showing their face on the streets, anarchists would crush them. But now, apart from the 500.000 votes they gained (actually latest polls show them up to 10% from 7% where they were in the last elections), their core members have risen a lot, as a lot young people (men and women) are recruited in their ranks and actively roam the streets. Now a significant part of Greek society (of all ages) supports them and think they do good. I don't know how or what they say to themselves when they hear about tortures, beatings and murders, how they find excuses, how they turn a blind eye, but they do. Mind you there was always a significant part of Greek society that was extreme-right - a part that thought the latest military junta was a good thing, a part that wants the king to return, etc. 

So there are clashes with anarchists but I think the reality is that now Golden Dawn far surpasses the anarchists in numbers and also, maybe more importantly, Golden Dawn is active in a lot of places in Greece, especially the countryside (where they get a big part of their percentage anyway). The anarchist movement is traditionally strong in certain areas of Athens and Thessaloniki (also, almost only among young people) but that's about it. They can be very strong and active in certain places and GD wouldn't dare to cross them there (yet anyway) but in other places GD has now far a greater reach. 

Also don't forget the fact that GD is supported in many cases by state authority. Police can be on their side in many cases. I won't get in details on how many policemen voted for them cause there are disagreements there and an article that said that the majority of them voted for them proved to be false, but some policemen certainly help them or turn a blind eye. When you also have the state helping you in some cases you are even stronger. And anyway let's don't forget the fact that the state policy is not in essence different from their policy - they both want the immigrants out. Officially, of course, the state is against violence but.... let's not be naive, the line is thin and blurry there, and we all know (at least if you read the researchers and news and don't turn a blind eye) how many immigrants suffer from state violence every day in various ways.",0,1347141714,null,0,false,0,c65evby,t3_zj8hk,t1_c65evby,t1_c65anyd,null,1429851158,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Also, I was told that no interpreters were at hand and that the treatment was very standardised and percieved as hastened and unfair by immigrants. 

I have been shown documents with blanks to fill in names and reasons for the denial of asylum, but I have not managed to take pictures or photocopies. I was not there as part of a NGO team, just as an individual. 

And I hope that this was a measure out of sheer desperation by the police officers in Petrou Ralli, which were overwhelmed by a block-long queue of refugees waiting there for hours.

Theoretically, if we had been at the top of the table something like twelve years in a row we could have been in the Bundesliga - it's all in the same system.

Anyway our level was pretty bad but we took the training very seriously and most of the games were pretty competitive, if not particularly skilled. If you looking for more competitive football, look for a team in a real league, it doesn't necessarily have to be high level.

Most clubs will have several teams; ours had three, so we were the ""dritte Männer"". The ""erste Mannschaft"" will be the club's team highest in the league structure.

Some clubs will also have a ""Volkssport"" team, which is probably more what you're looking for. These are in a league with regular games, etc, but is an explicitly hobby league.

In any case to play you'll need a ""Spielerpass"", which you either get from your home country or apply for a new one. Depending on where you come from, this might be quick or slow but the club can help you out.

""Coffee"" is one of those tricky terms, like ""breakfast"" or ""soon"", that sort of mean the same everywhere, but on a closer inspection turn out to refer to wildly different things around the world. It may well be that if you are used to Starbucks and McDonald's type of coffee, you won't (subjectively speaking) find anything better anywhere in Europe.

I would, however, strongly suggest that you stick to trying out local coffee everywhere you go. And while sitting there with your cup, rather than thinking how disgusting the black liquid that you just purchased is, sip it down slowly and ponder what the character of the coffee actually tells you about local culture.

Not only is sampling different coffees a good way to experience an often extremely central part of local culture, but your taste buds may sooner or later start to accept that the concept of ""coffee"" doesn't necessarily need to refer to what you think is coffee.

It's not easy to 'get' when you need the definite article. There are probably rules, but I guess you just need some practice. Here there should not be one.

 * e devo qualcuno per parlare a.

If you wanted to translate ""I need someone to talk to"" then it's ""ho bisogno di qualcuno ***con cui*** parlare"" or ""mi serve qualcuno ***con cui*** parlare"". What you said is ""I must someone"".  

 * Aiutami, per favore?

Here you are addressing many people, so you should say ""aiutatemi, per favore"" (second person plural). This sounds a tiny bit too direct/pleading however (like you're a bit desperate), so a better way would be ""Potete aiutarmi, per favore?""

I kept my answer short.

I'm one of those that believe that the people behind the euro were federalists that KNEW this day was coming (I certainly expected it). The crisis would be a great way to push for integration that would otherwise be nearly impossible to achieve quickly.

Still, that is just the eurozone propagating and being vulnerable to the crisis. It does not change the fact that the crisis DID originate somewhere, and the weakness of others allowed it to spread. The fact that these were to be expected does not change the issues that there is a source-of-crisis and weak countries.

&gt; I don't see why Spain should be part of system where it can't prevent bubbles from forming, but must tighten the belt when shit hits the fan.

Well, that's a question for the Spanish.

Still, there are ways such bubbles can be prevented from forming. I suggested to jrohila that there should be EU level deposit insurance that would be tied to specific EU level banking regulation.

That banking regulation could have a few caveats tied to exposure to countries that would be related to the banks size, target economy size, target economy indebtedness.

Of course, a glut of investment still couldn't be stopped, but one wonders if we would really want to. Yes, over-investment creates some huge hiccups for the economy, but fundamentally **things are being built** (typically anyway). Housing booms almost always end up in busts, but they also tend to result in very nice and (post-boom) reasonably priced housing for tons of people.

This sort of booming can be moderated a little, but at the very end of the day one wonders if it really would have been better for Spain to not have had the boom (for example). Especially if a skilled historian looks at it from, say, 2050.

true,racergr,GREE,Greece,"Given the fact that all help is in form of interest-bearing loans, you're not exactly giving away money for free, you are investing. You are investing and betting that Greece will come out of the recession, will repay the loan and will continue to consume Germany's products (biggest importer in Greece is Germany). 

In the long-term, it is the right thing to do and makes absolute sense, in the same manner that you would help a family member through some hardship. 

In the sort term, and in order to ensure that the loan is paid back, the lenders, and primarily the Germans, have pushed for a very hard austerity which has been proven to not be working in the last 2-3 years.

Further proof that austerity is not working is also evident in the UK, despite that they engaged in quantitative easing (printing money). 

Therefore everybody is crying to switch to a growth plan and provide big stimulus packages (as the US did). This is what Soros is saying.

It is in the interest of everybody to think of the long term but somehow the German media and politicians have managed to turn every conventional wisdom around. It is like saying that you don't want to pay for your children's education.

And just for some facts:
The loan to Greece comes with a 4.5% interest, Germany can borrow their share of the loan at a 1.2% interest. If Greece pays back, you will be making a metric shittone of money, without spending a penny.

If Spain would have had sound fiscal policies, what the public sector would have done would been to cut back public infrastructure projects that themselves fuelled the construction boom even further.

Another thing is that even if Spain would have had its own currency or independent monetary policy, there still would have been real estate boom due to external matters such as loose low interest rates in the US, Japan, Europe and baby boomers coming into age to use their surplus to buy properties. Actually if Spain would have had its own currency the situation would have been even worse, because if the Spanish central bank would have hiked interest rates, then people and companies would have gotten foreign currency denominated loans, which would have become toxic post 2008, and leading the state either knock IMF or engage into immediate reforms.

Not to mention that during the real estate boom of 00s import duties to many different sectors were dropped, allowing the Chinese manufacturers to out compete their European counterparts.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Perhaps we would insure the bank deposits on a EU level, with that being fully an opt-in sort of thing. It isn't mandated on anyone, but if you don't follow the regulations, your deposits won't be insured. Then lets see whether the market decides that it wants to trust non-insured deposits, Greek govt insured deposits or EU insured deposits.

The problem with insuring bank deposits is that if we going to cover them 100%, then the only way to do it is print money in an hour of need. However if we don't cover them fully, then having a bank go down will take lots of companies with it. I really think that we need to have more relax rules for ECB to act with banks if and when needed.

Another thing is that any insurance seem should be mandatory, because we already have a common banking market thanks to SEPA, so allowing member states to toil away with something would sooner or later cause another crisis.

&gt;  Considering you criticized transfers of fiscal power... this is the ultimate transfer of fiscal power, and EU would have to have mechanisms for dealing with the huge transfer of power.

true,Delheru,FINL,Finland,"&gt; The problem with insuring bank deposits is that if we going to cover them 100%

I think the typical approach is something like ""up to 250k"". That doesn't cover quite everything, but it does cover enough that a run on the bank becomes incredibly unlikely.

&gt; Another thing is that any insurance seem should be mandatory, because we already have a common banking market thanks to SEPA, so allowing member states to toil away with something would sooner or later cause another crisis.

Given this crisis, I suspect the end users that use the banks would pay a great deal of attention to which banks have the backing of the party that can print money. Still, if the regulations are stifling, I can see the end user benefits being such that a free rider problem might evolve (trusting that implicitly EVERYONE is insured).

true,racergr,GREE,Greece,"I like how you started from my last point. Yes, in theory we're making money but the real winner is our lenders and partners, who are having their debts paid back and who are avoiding the consequences of a Greek default in respect. 

We don't only need more money, we need policies to help us get unstuck from traditional Greek thinking. A good example is exporting education; we could be making a couple of billions p.a. if we exported education to the global audience that cannot afford going to expensive countries like the UK. We already have lots of private colleges that do this, and they have students from the Arabic countries and China. It is therefore a proven market and we also have the historical backing to market it appropriately (we're in the EU and, of course, we're known for Science and Philosophy contribution). We're not doing it because a small minority of 5% does not want ANY change is the business model of the Universities in Greece because they are afraid that Greeks will end up having to pay fees. We need a push in situations like this but it also needs a relatively small investment (i.e. marketing). Greece should take this seriously, at government level, in the same way we take tourism. 

Speaking of tourism, I live in the UK and I barely see any advertisement for holidays in Greece. There used to be some in the good years but now they are all gone. Worse, the situation in Greece has left a feeling that the country is dangerous and we're loosing a lot of revenue from our most important export. This can only be corrected with marketing and, yes, that requires money.

I am saying that we need more money, but most of all we need to be more competent. We need someone with authority (i.e. a lender) come with a big stick and beat us until we do things right. It also has to come with appropriate communication from the politicians to the people, in all involved countries. Right now, the notion in the EU is that ""we gave money to Greece"" and the notion in Greece is ""fucking Germans want to control us"". This is not going to end nicely.

That is not just true. It was caused by free flow of capital within eurozone that created bubbles.

And irresponsible spending is different from a bubble how?

It doesn't really matter to me if the state fucked up by being a incompetent and corrupt spendthrift mess like in Greece or a incompetent corrupt mess due to the inability of creating proper banking oversight like in Spain (and they probably didn't complain about the tax revenue they got from all these concrete monsters they littered the landscape with).

Matter of fact is that they fucked up things badly and should be placed under supervision until they fix it. This does *not* nescecarily  that ""poor people need to suffer"" or the like. It's just that this seems to be the easiest way out to them.

* When a state runs into bankruptcy, it has essentially demonstrated its inability to solve its problems. Usually this means that there is a political deadlock that makes it impossible to enact measures that actually are beneficial to everybody, currently one could say that Italy is in this situation as they have expert lead cabinet.
* Having the possibility of EU agency to step in would create a deterrent for political class that would obligate them to work together and try to solve their problems.

* Oil and gas would cost much more with devalued currency. This would hit people and companies very hard in Greece, Portugal and Italy who largely rely on imported fossil fuels. The impact would be smaller in Spain that has nuclear power, but it definitely would cause disruption and lower living standards in countries in question.
* Southern industries largely don't compete with German companies, they compete companies from China and other developing world. Of course having devalued currency would ease exports to Germany and others countries, but then again a good question to ask it do you really want to compete on price with Chinese. The thing is that Chinese not only have lower cost structure, they also have scale of economy, so any benefit coming out of devaluation would be soon over.

In case of Finland...

* The reason why BoF had strong currency policy was because large amounts of individuals and companies had taken foreign denominated debt. When the Mark had to devalued, what it caused was lots of individuals and otherwise healthy businesses going bankrupt, and this caused a whole set of cards to collide with each other, deepening recession into a full blown depression.
* There were other options to deal with the crisis. What was suggested at the time was internal devaluation that would have seen lowering of wages approx 3-6% if my memory deserves me right. This would have allowed export industries to regain competitiveness without causing massive bankruptcy wave that was caused by the devaluation and successive hiking of interest rates to the roof.
* I would argue that Estonia serves a good example of what should have been done at the time in Finland, but what wasn't done. Yes, the recession has hit hard Estonia, but due to internal devaluation, they haven't had massive bankruptcy wave that we saw in Finland, and what we would have seen in Estonia if they would have devalued during the crisis.",0,1347198252,null,0,false,0,c65npti,t3_zlf3i,t1_c65npti,t1_c65nj33,null,1429855387,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Of course everyone thinks that ""his"" brand is the best but you could say, that there is a rivalry between north and south.
In most parts of Germany Pils is the most popular beer but in the southern states (Bayern and Baden-Württemberg) people tend to drink more Weizen or Helles (which is a little sweeter (süffiger?) than Pils), while people in the ""Rheinland"" drink more Kölsch or Alt, depending on where they live.

If you come to Germany I'd simply recommend to go to a store, buy different kinds of beer (except the very cheap ones) and just find out what you like best.

In my opinion its not very helpful to recommend a certain brand as everyone has a different taste.

true,auseuro,null,null,"Fellow Australian here. I'll likely be downvoted for this but I presume you will look at all the comments regardless of their score. There have been many proposals for a dual euro system. They would have the same problems but on a far lesser level but it would likely be managable. The transition to such a system would be the difficult part though as people in the south would transfer their money to northern banks before the change-over (they are even doing so as we speak). If you are going to do that kind of change, people will rightfully wonder why not just go back to national currencies.  

It has to be asked why the proposed currency zone between New Zealand and Australia - which have far more similar economies, the same language, legal system and freedom of movement/employment like Shengen - was laughed at by New Zealand and Australian economists and politicians. Because it isn't needed, floating currencies do work and they are intimately tied to democracy. It's simply not practically needed either, with digital banking and exchange the whole tourism argument is bogus next to the benefits of having your own currency. The AUD has gone from 50 USD cents to being worth more than the USD in a very short period so the argument that you need it for ""stability"" is false.

So why did the EU launch the euro then? Well it was launched as a prelude to further integration into a European federation, and even beyond that as a way to bind the countries closer together to make that federation happen. But the problem is every currency zone, even in coherent groupings like the USA, Australia or the parts of the UK, requires large transfers of money between the different parts of the economy. That requires political consent *first* before the transfers happen. Only two countries were asked if they wanted the euro in referendums and they both said no. The Germans, if they'd been given a vote, would also have said no. That's why Merkel's hands are so tied at the moment, the Germans were falsely told that this scenario would not happen because of debt and deficit limits in the treaties. Now it has happened and Merkel has an election around the corner so she has to make a mighty big show of being reluctant. That's why they are doing all these transfers arguably against the text of the treaties (under natural disaster clauses and buying bonds in secondary markets rather than directly and via abuse of the IMF). That's also why the very odd ESM treaty has been proposed, which more or less would give technocrats vast powers over these kinds of transfers without any democratic oversight.  

What you have to remember when examining the Euro crisis is that most of the countries of the EU have hardly any democratic track record as we would think of it. There are lots of cultural achievements - music, science, architecture and art - but they don't have the same history of progressively better democracy that we have going back, via Britain, to Magna Carta Libertatum, with the first votes for women in the world occuring in New Zealand and Australia, the first secret ballot and the rest. We have a clearly defined constitution and have had a large number of referendums over the years (most defeated) to modify it democratically according to our needs. Most of the key EU treaties have hardly any democratic legitimacy and have just been put together much like ACTA or other global treaties that are written behind closed doors. Some, like Lisbon, are re-writes of things they couldn't get through and were pushed through with multiple votes in Ireland and loads of propaganda money. So only a handful of European countries have similar standards to us or anything like our democratic history. Indeed, a large number of these countries were fascist or communist dictatorships only a handful of decades ago. They are now even expanding into Balkan states which were slaughtering each other in the 1990s and still have crowds waving posters of wanted war criminals. There are baying fascist mobs in Greece attacking immigrants and in Romania and Hungary attacking Roma people. There is a significant neo-nazi or far-right movement in almost every one of these countries that can't even be conceptualised in Australian terms. There are also significant violent neo-communist movements in quite a few places. People in this subreddit like to sneer at the ""unsophisticated"" USA, but there have been far more political assasinations by right and left extremists across the EU and candidate countries in recent decades.  

The European project, when we break this false Europe=sophistication narrative, isn't a happy-go-lucky thing where we might imagine all the Europeans are just like the Scandanavians. Not to say that factor isn't present, the Scandanavians and a few others fight very hard to keep it on track, but their voices are small. A large part of it is the power plays of elites who have more or less no democratic history or training with very naive, young and often corrupt institutions. Imagine Australia if every government, state and federal, were as bad as the recent NSW Labor government and every conservative was as corrupt and incompetent as Joh Bjelke-Petersen was, that gets you closer to how things run in Europe.

What will happen? Well it's either huge transfers or breakup of the eurozone, but the eurozone is intimately tied with the EU project so the elites will make every attempt to stop the breakup. This means we can expect democracy to be significantly lessened (ESM treaty, dubious ECB actions, other forms of transfers) for these purposes. To stabilise without a breakup will take titanic effort as there is no real reason why Greeks should be so much richer than Eastern Europeans or someone from Brasil, their boom in living standards was almost entirely false based on the euro and lending. This means outside forces dictating budgets, it means massive transfers not just from Germany but also from places that are poorer per capita than the SIC PIGS. While it's highly unlikely to revert to ""type""/into another massive bloodbath that requires Australians and New Zealanders to have to set sail for the third time to (help) sort them out again and make sure democratic forces prevail, it will likely become more autocratic and more like some of the authoritarian Asian states.",0,1347198578,null,0,false,0,c65nrdt,t3_zljm0,t1_c65nrdt,t3_zljm0,null,1429855408,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

&gt; Lower productivity countries need their own currency so that their wages can stay competitive (alternatively, fiscal transfers). If Spain stays in eurozone it must solve the problem with relative deflation via high unemployment. That's not good idea. 

True, are you saying southern Europe should leave? I can agree with you there, from an economical standpoint.

&gt; Before euro, Greece devalued it's currency every time it got into trouble. It paid price for that in the form of high interest rates. When Greece joined eurozone, private bankers made major fuckup and reduced the interest rates. Did Greece turn into Germany overnight? No it did not. 

You've also forget to mention the massive debts they even had before, the massive corruption and the low productivety.

&gt;You can't turn South European countries into Germany with discipline or regulations. Their economies are different even if you take corruption out from the picture. Monetary and fiscal policies should reflect the realities and not the political ideals. 

I agree with you there, but then it must also be a stupid idea to give them unlimited transfers, which they are doing at the moment. The transfers should stop then

true,PredictionBoom,null,null,"Hey! German beer connoisseur here.

You'll have a lot to discover, and i'll try to make a few suggestions. Germany has a fantastic brewing tradition, even though the influence of large beverage corporations is growing and many big breweries now belong to AnheuserBusch-InBev (i'm sure you heard of those guys ;) and the german Radeberger AG. Some of us germans can be a bit arrogant about their beer, even though the quality of the main brands in the supermarket is average at best.

Thankfully many independent breweries are alive and kicking, especially in Bavaria and Franconia. Here are some beers and varieties i really like:

**Helles**

""Helles"" is your go-to everyday Lager. It's clear and light. It's a bit more watery compared to other, heavier sorts, making it mild and refreshing. It's also an excellent choice to get completely wasted with, since you can chuck down Helles after Helles without getting tired of it. I'd suggest:

* Augustiner Helles - *The* brewery when it comes to Helles. Available everywhere, cult following.
* Tegernseer
* Riegele Commerzienrat - Rare and a bit more spicy

**Weissbier / Weizenbier  / Hefeweizen**

Weissbier is unfiltered beer brewed with wheat malt. It's an outstanding german specialty and very common in Bavaria. It's cloudy and a bit heavier than Helles. It's very fruity and refreshing, with notes of banana, citrus and clove. Some are more spicy, some are lighter and more fruity, almost like lemonade. Great summer beer and really, really delicious. My favourites:

* Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier - It's pretty much perfect. It's also the oldest working brewery in the world, and it's not far from Ingolstadt! You should really go there and take a tour. Someone else mentioned on reddit that they have been brewing beer since before the English language existed, which is a crazy thought.
* Schneider Weisse - look for the sorts ""TAP5"" and ""TAP7 Original""
* Ayinger Bräu-Weisse
* Riegele Sebastian Riegele's Hefeweisse - Very fruity and with a nice hoppy aftertaste
* Flötzinger 1543 Hefeweisse
* Franziskaner Weissbier
* One of the hundreds of regional Weissbiere, just try as many as you can!

**Pilsener / Pils**

Clear, pale lager with more hops, resulting in a more dry, bitter taste, comparable to American pale ales or a light IPA. These are more common and traditional in north germany, but they're also popular in the South. I enjoy these the most:

* Waldhaus Diplom-Pils - Can be hard to get, but it's a fantastic pils. If i had to drink a single beer for the rest of my life, it would be this one. Complex taste, not to mild, not to bitter, not to boring, not to malty. Refreshing but not watery.
* Karmeliten Pils
* Rothaus Tannenzäpfle - More common, and very good.
* Flensburger Pils - Classic north german pils, well made
* Jever - Available in supermarkets, quite alright, but a bit acidic and metallic

**Other things you should try**

* The reddish Kellerbiere (cellar beers) common in Franconia - less carbon and more malt than a Helles, nice on a sunny day from a stone mug
* The strong, dark Bockbiere (bock beers). Try a Schneider Aventinus or a Scheider Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock. It's like drinking a chocolate cake (with 12% alcohol...). Awesome beers.
* Rauchbier (smoke beer) - A Franconian specialty. The ingridients are smoked over wood fires. The result is a beer that tastes like bacon. You'll either completely love it, or you'll be fighting to keep it down. I fall into the latter category, but some friends treat it like a religion.

Just try whatever you can get your hands on! Word of advice: Don't order Beck's when you're in Bavaria. You will be murdered with pitchforks and i won't defend you. Also, never, never ever drink Oettinger, the german equivalent to Pabst Blue Ribbon. You'll be going to house parties with other students, and there will be a point where Oettinger is the only thing left. Leave the party. ""Oettinger - Not even once.""

true,Delheru,FINL,Finland,"&gt; If we want to solve this problem with structural reform, we must make eurozone into more optimal currency area.

There's one huge problem that could be addressed that is way bigger than the ""fiscal transfer mechanism"", and that's the FIRST thing about an optimal currency area:    
Labor Mobility

We're going to have to wing this to one degree or another until the Labor Mobility problem is sorted. Sure, on paper labor mobility is good, but this is in SPITE of the EU (which thinks that French is as important a language as English, in a tireless crusade against the windmills) rather than because of it. Lots of people know English fortunately, but if I take 100 small businesses from Germany/France and 100 would-be employees from Greece and Spain, the language fit won't be anywhere near 100% - it might be more like 20-25%, most of which will be english spoken on both sides.

So one of the very first things we need to do if we want the euro area to work is to admit on a very high level that English is the lingua franca, and EU will provide extraordinary support for people in that language (and won't replicate it to a million other languages).


The way the fiscal transfer mechanism would have to be done would almost certainly be via some sort of taxation ability of the EU. As that would in general be wildly unpopular with anything local, I suspect that the financial industry would be a good first target for the taxes. Perhaps 10% capital gains tax on the EU level would also be popular enough, as it would discourage wealthy people from playing around with their money inside the EU.",0,1347205638,null,0,false,0,c65ozsx,t3_zlf3i,t1_c65ozsx,t1_c65mtu7,null,1429855991,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

**Israel wants a say in German weapon sales**

**The Israeli government is planing a fixed meeting with Berlin to co-decide future weapon exports. Every time Germany plans to export to the Arabic world Jerusalem should be asked first.**

Tel Aviv - Isreal is obviously pushing towards securing their military superiority	through a co-deciding privilege of German weapon exports. The director for political and military affairs withing the Israeli defense ministry, Amos Gilad, had talks in in regards of that matter last week with the German government in Berlin, prints the newspaper ""Haaretz"" last Sunday while quoting high ranking government officials.

Goal of this Israel effort is the establishing of a speaking basis with Germany, to prevent the loss of the Israeli military superiority due to German weapon sales (slightly paraphrased)

As an example of German military exports within the region, the unnamed government members stated planed sales of ""Leopard"" tanks to Saudi-Arabia and alleged shipments of frigates to Algeria.

The planned export of submarines to Egypt also created some fuss recently. The Israel government is, according to newspaper reports, quite angry about that. There's no official statement yet. According to the Bild, Germany promised Israel to stop the deal with Egypt within the Bundessicherheitsrat (state security council) if Egypt will show any aggression against Isreal.

From official sides the government is keeping quiet despite the reports. Although, on quite we hear that such a deal about submarines would be discussed with Israel in any case, nobody knows anything about any annoyance.

The report from ""Haaretz"" about the demand of a permanent say was published a few hours before Germany's foreign minister Guido Westerwelle (FDP) was expected for a short meeting with president Benjamin Netanjahu and defense minister Ehud Barak in Isreal.

At the talks in Jerusalem the atomic controversial with Iran is probably the center of discussion. Afterwards new initiatives in the deadlocked Near East peace process will be discussed. There are also plans for a meeting with the palasitinian president Salam Fajad.

Bref, de petites tactiques plus que des remèdes de cheval. Et, plus que tout, je crois que c'est la joie qui nus libère. Ce ne sont pas la privation et le renoncement qui mènent à la joie, mais c'est la joie qui conduit au détachement et qui aide à demeurer libre sans se laisser happer par les passions tristes.*

true,racergr,GREE,Greece,"&gt; And exactly new policies and ideas is what the EU has been waiting for for years. But so far not much seems to have happened in that regard.

That is why we should all, as Europeans be demanding more positive things from the politicians. For example, more efficiency, less bureaucracy, more transparency, less influence from the rich etc. 

&gt; Do you think it's a good idea for Greece to rely on tourism in the long run?

Well, tourism is the biggest part of our economy but it is only 12%, i.e. not *that* big. We have lots of resources, primarily our highly-educated young people but natural resources as well. I'm sure we can find our way round, given enough shaking of the status quo. I hope is crisis provides the shaking.

&gt; Indeed, probably not. What Greeks often seem to not take into account is that Germany (or the EU) can't force them to do anything or impose any measures on them

Indeed but on the other hand we cannot force anyone to give us help. The help is given to Greece not to save Greece, but to save the Eurozone. The other countries are not a charity, there is incentive to keep a healthy Eurozone economy and a healthy Greek economy, that is why we were given help.

&gt; Well to be fair the cartoon in indeed true (as the Greeks cooked their books and therefore scammed everyone)

Well, that is precisely what is not fair, you see. First of all, the ""book cooking"" is realy questionable (see the relevant [wikipedia article and section](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Greece#Eurozone_entry) , it is well sourced). However, even if it was entirely true, how come the whole  EU be cheated by a bunch of canny Greeks? The only answer is because they *wanted* to be cheated. Moreover, other countries have shown to be doing similar book-cooking, including France and Germany (I don't have sources but I remember reading about these on some reddit posts). And finally, even if book cooking happened, it was the mistake of certain people in power at the time, not the mistake of all the Greeks who are receiving the wrath of the German media. We have contributed to Europe and the western civilisation for more than 3,000 years, even the name ""Europe"" is Greek. How can a pitiful German tabloid magazine dare ridicule Greece this way?

The Greeks don't hate the Germans. We love Germany and we have always regarded the country very highly. It is just that this crisis hilights all extremism and everybody is looking for someone to blame. Some people are mad against the German media, others are mad against Merkel, others cite the wars, others city the Greek immigrants who helped on the German economic miracle etc. This is a total panic situation, where nobody can become someone overnight by saying something smart against the Germans or lagarde or whatever.

You think things like this happen simply because they suddenly felt like genociding someone? Nope, it's the long conflict history where anti-multiculturalistic kurds are more to blame than the other civilizations on the area. Kurdi is not a official language in Turkey, and neither is Turkish in Germany despite Germany having more Turks by percentage of population than Turkey has Kurdis. I don't see a problem there.

&gt;host society? are you trolling? kurds have been living on the territory of today's Kurdistan since at least the 10th century (that's before the turks even came to anatolia)

Host society is the one which currently happens to own the clay and is the majority. Kurds are a minority but sadly never have embraced the multiculturalistic ideals, but instead resorted to violence.

* Is it about beliefs on how society should work?

Besides - coal power plants produce radioactive waste, too. And it's whole hills of waste, that is slightly radioactive instead of very small amount of highly radioactive waste that nuclear power plants produce. The highly radioactive waste that you get from nuclear power plants you can burn to be less radioactive (and it will only take a few centuries for that less radioactive waste to stop being dangerous. We have the technology tu build containment for a few tons of radioactive waste to last a few centuries). And it's orders of magnitude less waste (by mass or by volume) than from coal power plants.

Also - coal power plants release radioactive dust into air during regular operation. You don't want to live near correctly operating coal power plant. Safely operating nuclear power plant is green. Safely operating coal power plant is ecological dissaster, even not taking CO2 into account.

For example in Greece they don't have free school lunches, if I understood correctly no lunches at all. Families take care that kids have something to eat. Now due to crisis many families don't have money to have food for kids. Well, that is huge problem because you really can't learn or be happy in school if you are hungry.

Now what Greek charitable organizations have tried to do is to supply food items to those families who don't have enough money... This simply to say is very stupid and inefficient because buying and handing over food is much more expensive than actually preparing food and cooking food from raw materials. A much better way would be to simply get a soup kitchen, raw food items, and somebody to cook. With this way you would lower the cost of lunch to under few euros easily.

You know these same kind of things were discovered here 100 years ago and they started out from charitable organizations and school organizing school lunches. So why isn't this happening in Greece? Can't the public schools launch these kind of initiatives? Where is the problem? The money is already there, it just needs to be used more efficiently.

ADDITION: Lets say you have school of 300 children. You ask parents to contribute 2 euros per day, so a month of school lunch would cost 40 euros. Lets say that some pay more, they want to help out, and some don't pay at all. So that would mean that there is 12000 euros to spend in one month on hiring one or two people and basic ingredients potatoes, vegetables, wheat, some meat, etc...

I do not deny the tensions on the northern border, but to generalize the whole nation as akin to the trouble in that area is similar to generalizing the entirety of New York State as NYC. It's just inaccurate. The Kosovars I have talked to about the issue all just want to move on. They coexist peacefully with the Serb population here in Pristina and just wish for the same in return. 

I'll say similar for the mafia statement - yes the element exists, but you have to try pretty hard to get wrapped up in it. Ordinary people here just live their lives day to day as they do anywhre else. Also like the political tensions, crime is concentrated in pockets in various towns and cities; the whole country is not overrun with gangsters as the media would have you believe.

Because it isn't needed, floating currencies do work and they are intimately tied to democracy.

Well, I don't think you can compare the two that well.

First of all, a two-state currency bloc is quite a bit different from a 17-state currency bloc.

Secondly, and this is tied to point #1, there's a disparity between the size of the two states. NZ has a GDP of $161.9 billion, Australia has a GDP of $914.5 billion. In Europe, any disparity between individual states is offset by the fact that there are 15 other states involved.

Far from it.

Let me remind you that the first Greek ""bailout"" was decided in Q2 2010. Let's see the real data from 2010.

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-05/german-banks-top-french-with-23-billion-in-greek-debt-bis-says.html

&gt; **German** lenders were the biggest foreign owners of Greek government bonds with **$22.7 billion** in holdings last year, making them a likely negotiation partner in burden-sharing deals for the country, data from the Bank for International Settlements showed. **French** banks, which led the group of Greek creditors with overall claims amounting to $56.7 billion, trailed their German peers on sovereign debt with **$15 billion**, according to the June report from the Basel, Switzerland-based BIS. 

See also the graph from WSJ.

http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304906004576371590191453136.html

German banks were 50% more exposed than French banks in 2010, the year of the first ""bailout"".  After that, they started offloading Greek holdings faster than anyone else, in order to limit large cuts during the PSI (second ""bailout"").

&gt; your nonsense articles ... a nutcase ... editorial

Well, everyone must be an ignoramus nutcase if you don't agree with him/her, respected university professors or not. Maybe this one from FTD is a nutcase too, talking about Germany's profits from the Greek crisis.

I can google as well as you, so there is nothing to gain here. Either post reliable numbers or drop the subject. Eg (second hit on ""french banks selling greek bonds to ecb 2009""):

http://www.infiniteunknown.net/2010/05/31/ecb-buying-up-greek-bonds-german-central-bankers-suspect-french-intrigue/

""German banks, on the other hand, are not potential sellers, because they have made a voluntary commitment to Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble to hold their Greek bonds until May 2013.""

&gt; Let me remind you that the first Greek ""bailout"" was decided in Q2 2010. Let's see the real data from 2010.

And I said: ""In fact, german banks, at the beginning of the Greek tragedy, promised not to sell their bonds when french banks were shoveling that shit to the ECB by the truckload.""

Which is exactly what happened. 

&gt; Well, everyone must be an ignoramus nutcase if you don't agree with him/her, respected university professors or not. Maybe this one from FTD is a nutcase too, talking about Germany's profits from the Greek crisis.

No, not really, but I read the article matching to this:

http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/zc1cg/yanis_varoufakis_while_awaiting_mr_draghis_6th/

And as I said, I'm still waiting for info why that guy isn't a nutcase.

And the Reuter thing *is* an editorial, i.e. an opinion piece.

&gt; Not at all. The first domestic myth is that Germany pays for everyone else (""we"").

The ""we"" in this case meant ""all of us"". If France goes under, it's game over. And when you look at the FT chart, you see why it's likely it *will* go under unless something happens (""we"" as in Germany is paying the fucking bill).

&gt; German banks were 50% more exposed than French banks in 2010, the year of the first ""bailout"". 

As I told you: German banks agreed to hold on to Greek debt as to not bring their values even lower *in advance* of the bailout. *French* banks did nothing of the sort. The fact that the mainly exposed banks were Commerzbank, HypoRealEstate and Postbank probably helped as they were all basically insolvent and under state control. And: these banks were directly affected by the haircut, so we actually layed down ""real"" money for Greece (~16 bln IIRC?).

And your ARD piece, well. By now you must have realized that the German populace is *far* from enthusiastic about the greek bailout. This is basically government propaganda repeating the same crap that Merkel has been spewing since day one: ""It's only a loan"", ""Germany profits immensely from the Euro"", ""We'll get our money back"".

Sure we will get our money back, when hell freezes over. And yes, we do profit from having an interest rate less than zero, but whose fault is that exactly?

&gt; France is exposed, but it's not the raison d'être (""only"") for the ""bailouts"".

It's the reason *we* agree to the bailouts (At least that is my assumption).

Edit: 

&gt;In practice, 75-80% of the loans (which are not gifts and they come with a little present called interest) don't come from Germany.

true,DaphneDK,FARO,Faroe Islands,"So apparently there is a mutual agreement in that the USA gives Israel a say in what they export to the nations in the region to ensure a qualitative edge to Israel; and Israel allows the USA to decide what military equipment it can sell and to whom – to a great loss of Israel exports. Such an agreement is beneficial for both sides; Israel and the USA, and by extension Germany. But if Germany starts to sell high-tech weapons to the nations the USA abstain from, this agreement is undermined.

But anyway, there’s no reason for Israel to get its knickers in a twist. Leopard tanks and other sophisticated weapons to Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Egypt, etc. isn’t going to be a serious treat to Israel, nor will it undermine the Israeli qualitative edge, for the simple reason that Saudi Arabia et. al. have piss poor and substandard trained military personal, and they’ll never be able to use the weapons effectively even if they tried. The Leopard will just sit in some desert warehouse doing nothing. Also Saudi money spent on bombs is Saudi money not spent on spreading fundamentalist Wahhabis Islam across the globe. So selling weapons to Saudi Arabia will ultimately lead to a more peaceful world.

Also clearly Israel picking out Germany, rather than e.g., the UK or France, reveals a calculated move on the Israeli part, that they believe they can manipulate German history to their advantage.

See what our feeling is, that they are like a kind of invader coming to our country ruining it. But this sort of understanding is wrong. Most of the people coming to Europe are in hope of a better life, many of them come from poor places. After WWII especially we in Germany had waves of immigrants so called ""lend-workers"" we thought they would go back to their countries, after Germany was rebuilt, but they stayed because they liked it here. We have to accept them as equal, they are like we are: people in hope for a good life for their families to prosper far away from war and crisis.

Depends how you see it, Australia has many states with different economies. But in any case fewer would be better and more likely to have higher coherence. The argument that more partners makes it a different creature is false. There are 50 states in the USA, but their coherence on all measures of similarity is higher than the EU and they have way way higher labour mobility.  

&gt;Secondly, and this is tied to point #1, there's a disparity between the size of the two states. NZ has a GDP of $161.9 billion, Australia has a GDP of $914.5 billion. In Europe, any disparity between individual states is offset by the fact that there are 15 other states involved.  

How is the disparity ""offset""? This is just nonsense quoting raw GDP figures and not GDP per capita or the industrial make-up of an economy, to say nothing of the USA example exploding this point. I think you need to read up on what an optimal currency zone actually is.

true,kafros,GREE,Greece,"Technically everyone is  'exempt' for something, there is always something that can lower your tax. Lets talk practically now: is the tax deduction unreasonable? No. Why? Two reasons:

1. This income is not produced in Greece: These are foreign owned vessels (i.e. the owner is an off-shore company), with non-Greek crews, operating outside Greek borders, carrying non Greek cargo.

2. They are taxed on a similar level to what they would be taxed elsewhere. From my 1st point, it is evident that you can base such a company anywhere in the world, there is nothing special about having a Greek base of operations other than the owner being Greek. If the tax is to be increased, the base of operations is going to change. UK proposed a tax increase to shipping companies in London, and cancelled it after most companies started planning their relocation.
