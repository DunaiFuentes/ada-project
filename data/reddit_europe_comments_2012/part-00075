Es dient seinem Zweck zu sportlichen Ereignissen. Danach ist es vollkommen überflüssig. Wie es sich im Artikel liest: ""Nationalstolz"" kommt hoch wenn sich irgendeine Art von Verzweiflung gebildet hat. Er ist auch wunderbar um wichtige Themen zu überdecken oder die gerechtfertigten Gefühle der Masse umzulenken. Auf sinnlosen Blödsinn. So wie im Thema oben mit HarzIV und der WM. 

Wo trifft man den im Alltag auf ""Nationalstolze"" Bürger? Also abgesehen von den offensichtlichen Faschos. Hauptsächlich in der Polemik. Am Stammtisch z.B. oder in Schützenvereinen oder der Politik. Da erwartet man das auch von den Menschen. Es zeugt in dem Kontext den sie damit schaffen auch von ihrem niedrigen Niveau bzw. von fehlenden Argumenten. Ich wüsste jetzt nicht ein mal wie ich in meiner ausländischen Firma Tag täglich meinen Nationalstolz äußern könnte. Die Ausländer dort tun es auch nicht.

Ich sehe das so: wenn jemand seinen Lokal/Nationalstolz ausspielen will, kann er das das ganze Jahr über beim Sport tun. Ansonsten kann er das genauso gut stecken lassen. 




&gt;Die wohlfeilste Art des Stolzes hingegen ist der Nationalstolz. Denn er verrät in dem damit Behafteten den Mangel an individuellen Eigenschaften, auf die er stolz sein könnte, indem er sonst nicht zu dem greifen würde, was er mit so vielen Millionen teilt. Wer bedeutende persönliche Vorzüge besitzt, wird vielmehr die Fehler seiner eigenen Nation, da er sie beständig vor Augen hat, am deutlichsten erkennen. Aber jeder erbärmliche Tropf, der nichts in der Welt hat, darauf er stolz sein könnte, ergreift das letzte Mittel, auf die Nation, der er gerade angehört, stolz zu sein. Hieran erholt er sich und ist nun dankbarlich bereit, alle Fehler und Torheiten, die ihr eigen sind, mit Händen und Füßen zu verteidigen.

If you mean that Europeans residing on the Italian Peninsula about 2000 years ago were better at building a wealthy and stable society than the majority of Africans today, then you would probably also be right. It's still not racism. The moment it becomes racism is when someone says ""they suck at building societies *because they are African*"". That would also be a blatantly false statement, since many of the first civilizations were African (Egypt is a good example, but also Ethiopians). But there is no implication of causality.

Now, we can discuss the reasons why the African continent is in such a bad shape, but I'm pretty sure we all agree that the fact that Africans are generally black have nothing to do with it.

Depending on your budget, you could get an apartment in the Center, for a fair price per month. Even better, depending on your age/occupation, is you could qualify for the [CAF](http://www3.caf.fr/). I've had friends live a block from Place D'Erlon for €600 per month, I payed €350 for a place on Rue Gambetta. (You'll know these street names once you get to know the town.) I lived in the south of Reims, and I can really only tell you about that area. 

Assuming you won't have a car, grocery stores in Reims are on the small side (im comparing them to the US). You'll have a few Carrefour Market and Monoprix/Monop scattered around. For myself, groceries per week ran me €40. 

Visit [Citura's](http://www.citura.fr/) website for bus/tram fare details. Fare is €1,60 as of now. 

I trust you speak French, English speakers in Reims are not too common. 

Reims isn't a very lively city, but it is close to Paris which is great. I'd be happy to tell you more about student life in Reims, so feel free to PM me with questions about that or anything else.

Granted, every office in a public institution has someone that is 3-4 times as productive as the mean, but that just means the rest don't feel they have to work as hard.

Consider also the fact that excessive bureaucracy is ridiculously rampant: If I need to buy f.e. toner for the copy machine, I will need to obtain 4 signatures (a tenured professor, sector head, department head, department accountant) then the vice-rector has to sign off on this expense, I get to buy the item on credit, then for the actual payment I need another 5 signatures (tenured professor, sector head, 3 witnesses that I've received the item in good condition); after this point I don't know what happens, but I think it needs another 2-3 signatures by the Uni's accounting department.

Basically these are a means of exchanging labour - a bartering system . There are many of them in existence at the moment . A discount scheme is a similar system . It is like a loyalty card but expanded . 

Yes taxes would be avoided but they wouldn't be paid anyway - the economy is bust and until the bad money is retired and replaced with the good money that will continue to be the situation .

Labour and hence money has varying value . If one is on the job site one is paid a full wage . However if one is doing work around the garden , including helping in a friends garden the rating for one's work is zero - zero income and zero taxes . However one can still barter that labour .

There is a lot in an economy that can be seen as being purely in a local economy . There are farmers in Greece , there is certainly plenty of local labour - a baby sitter can exchange her labour for a sack of potatoes .

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; Even leaving aside the cause, I think it's pretty clearly true that nobody has proposed a workable solution. I'm not sure exactly why, but I would guess lack of political strength and consensus.

It depends on your definition of ""workable"", I guess, but there are a couple.

What Germany is pushing for is just that central government that Krugman says is the reason why it works in the US. That's obviously something that can't be done over night, but it's the long term solution that is needed.  
That's what we should have had from the start, and what we failed to create in the ~~decade~~ now almost 15 years since. The reason we have failed to get this done is that states don't like to give up sovereignty, and obviously you can't have a central government while at the same time remaining fully independent.

Other proposals include internal transfers, be it through direct stimulus packages or through Eurobonds. You can't have a single currency without internal transfers. This is well understood. There are internal transfers within federations that use a single currency, like Germany or the US. Some are direct, like the *Länderfinanzausgleich* in Germany, some are indirect, like a central system for pensions, welfare payments or unemployment benefits. Eurobonds would in a sense be internal transfers as well -- the core countries would pay higher interest rates than they do now, and the periphery would pay less. On average, though, it would be less, at least if there was a central government so investors could trust the system not blowing up.  
Of course, internal transfers have to come from somewhere, and that makes them just as unpopular in those countries as surrendering some sovereignty to a central government would be in others, or even those same ones. Just look at how much people bitched about the relatively tiny internal transfers we've had in the EU all the time, like through the common agricultural policy or the structural and cohesion funds.

So, two effective solutions, and we need both. But neither is popular, so the ""workable"" part is the question here.

&gt; I don't think the idea of restructuring Greece's public sector is a bad one overall, though I think it's not so much its size/pensions/etc. that's the underlying problem, but corruption and general inefficiency.

Apart from the general issue that tax payer don't like to part with their money, there are two main problems with internal transfers. The first one are those inefficiencies in (especially) Greece that both you and Krugman mentioned. I *like* the EU. I'm very much pro European integration, and I recognize the necessity for internal transfers. But even I particularly enjoy paying more than necessary just because my government can effectively collect taxes from me and the Greek government fails to collect those from people there that make much more than I ever will, and then goes on to spend that money inefficiently. This needs to get fixed ~~if~~ when a system for permanent internal transfers gets implemented, or we set ourselves up for a political crisis that would be just as potentially damaging as the economic one.  
The other problem with internal transfers is precisely that they would work so well. In the short term, they are the easy solution, political issues in the core countries aside. However, many of the structural reforms that are indeed needed in countries like Greece are politically difficult. There simply is no reason to believe that politicians there will do the opposite of what they had done in the past when we effectively recreate pre-crisis conditions. Samaras will have to hurt some of the people he used to cater to in the past, and politicians everywhere like to leave unpopular decisions to their successors whenever they can. They're the ultimate procrastinators.  
This is just as true for the Eurozone as a whole. If we only manage a temporary fix, it will be just that -- temporary. And since it worked so well this time, and will work next time, it will become periodic, the new status quo.

So, this makes the first solution something like a precondition for the second one. What we need to do now is to at least outline a path towards the level of integration that is necessary for a stable common currency, including a system for automatic internal transfers. Otherwise we'll slip back into permanent procrastination mode, on the European level just as on the national ones, and will be in the same spot we're in right now a few years down the road -- probably sooner rather than later, because now we have demonstrated to markets what kind of weaknesses exist in the way the Eurozone has been set up.

&gt; As far as I can tell, there weren't any real credible transition plans, though, proposed by anyone on any side. Significant restructuring of a government could maybe be done on a really accelerated pace over, say, a few years, if you want something that's going to work and stick. And if you want to transition more things to the private sector, there needs to be a private sector, not a recession-death-spiral that sends all the businesses into bankruptcy.

Yeah, since integration and setting up a system for permanent transfers take time, we need to find a solution for the meantime. Structural reforms, that is, to make the economy more efficient and the bureaucracy if not efficient then at the very least effective, can accelerate growth and independently from the transfer issue would be good for those countries in the long run. But this won't help if there's no more basis to accelerate from, so that recession-debt-spiral you mentioned needs to be interrupted to save the businesses that are already there. It's much cheaper to preserve them now than to rebuild them later on.

There's a proposal for this as well though, by Barroso et al., to issue commonly backed bonds for a stimulus program. That's at least something to built upon, and I think it would be politically possible because it somewhat mitigates the transfer issue by being limited in scope to specifically help businesses and because it would be a centralized program by the EU and not go through the national governments (I believe).  
If we set up a system to help the struggling economies without losing the leverage (there, I said it) to get those governments to implement necessary reforms, this would have positive effects, apart from helping those businesses. It would be a sign to the people in those countries that the EU really wants to help them, that they actually do get something in return for the policies their governments have to implement, and that the recession won't just go on forever.",0,1340092301,null,0,false,0,c52j2li,t3_v8z6g,t1_c52j2li,t1_c52dg43,null,1429176625,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

Borrowing money from US, EU or IMF will not fix real problems either. The thing is that you need money to fix real problem. And getting them as cheap as possible is the best way to start.

&gt;I do hope that some Russian official would get some sense into things and would just point out that their own country and citizens need the money more than Cyprus. 

Russia has rather large monetary reserves. And it doesn't give the money to Cyprus. It invests it into Cyprus' debt. And as a side benefit it also protects it's previous investments in Cyprus. Could they find better investment opportunity? perhaps they could. But this one is not that bad, plus it gives support to their closest ally in EU.

&gt;I also hope that Russians consider that in the future ECB and European tax payers aren't necessarily eager to save bond holders from a default or debt restructuring

They might not be eager but they would have to. There is no way around it. And in case they won't, Russia will loose much less then EU countries.

&gt;if they don't start austerity measures now.

Austerity measures is not a one pill fits all kind of thing. You have to look in the root of the problem of each individual country. Cyprus is in troubles not because it has a massive dept or unsustainable budget. Cyprus' banking sector is in troubles because it was tightly integrated with Greece's banks. There is absolutely no reason to implement any austerity measures.

I think this is key going forward:
&gt; It would be a sign to the people in those countries that the EU really wants to help them, that they actually do get something in return for the policies their governments have to implement, and that the recession won't just go on forever.

Greeks currently have vaguely two choices floating around in their heads:

1. Something vaguely in line with the current EU memorandum

2. Some kind of withdrawal from the Euro and devaluation

A lot of Greeks, especially compared to 3-4 years ago, now agree that significant internal reform is necessary, and are willing to grudgingly go along with #1... *if they think it will work*. The big problem for getting support is that it's not actually clear it will: people are scared that #2 will be a mess, but are *also* scared that #1 might turn out no better. If it produces never-ending recession and an eventual Euro exit anyway, why not go for #2, devalue, and try to rebuild, instead of dragging things along for years? It seems risky, so a lot of Greeks would opt for #1, but it has to look like there is some endgame where Greece's economy actually recovers.

With a more credible plan, I don't think it would be hard at all to get Greek voter support. ND won a plurality now *even with* this huge uncertainty and many voters frankly not believing that the EU memorandum plan will work.

Tell it to US. They had massive dept but no one cares. Their credit rating is still strong. Borrowing money is just a part of how every economy works. Russia is borrowing money even thou they have their own massive reserves for ""rainy day"". And Cyprus borrowing money from EU, US or IMF wouldn't event make it into an article. The only reason this article exists is that there are rusophobic fear mongers who think that evil Russia is up to something.

That doesn't fly. Russia is an authoritarian state nearing the border of dictatorship, you can and should be critical of what Kremlin is up to. In case of the UK, if UK would come up and say that it is an close ally of US inside the EU, that too would be treasonous talk. However UK isn't an ally of the US inside the EU, US doesn't dictate to UK how to behave and impact the EU decision making.

&gt; You kidding me? Right? If EU would stop support for eurozone countries the currency will take quite a bit of damage. European banks will get a huge blow after loosing all their investments in Greece. Uncertainty about future of Italy and Spain will deliver even bigger one. And I hope I don't have to tell you what happens when baking sector takes a big hit. Cuz that's what started it all.

European banks have already made big marks down in their investments to Greece, and I wasn't talking about stopping propping up Greece. I was talking that European tax payers shouldn't be responsible for irresponsible decisions made by the Cypriot state, for example loaning money from Russia: if Cypriot state goes bust, Russians should take the loss and not have the European tax payer pay them.

&gt; That's just crazy talk.

It is not. European Union has a unified banking sector, if commercial banks in Cyprus would go bust, they could be easily replaced by European banks that could take over the banking sector.

&gt; Tell it to US. They had massive dept but no one cares. Their credit rating is still strong. Borrowing money is just a part of how every economy works. Russia is borrowing money even thou they have their own massive reserves for ""rainy day"".

US and Russia are not part of the Eurozone, how they handle their matters are their problem. What I will say is that both US and Russia will have to make structural reforms and enact their own austerity measures sooner or later, both of the state are inefficient and waste resources.

&gt; And Cyprus borrowing money from EU, US or IMF wouldn't event make it into an article. The only reason this article exists is that there are rusophobic fear mongers who think that evil Russia is up to something.

The problem is that Cyprus is not enacting sufficient austerity measures to handle the crisis, but instead borrows more money that comes with questionable ties. If and when things go more wrong, it will be the EU and IMF that will be at the other end, and they have to sort the crisis out that could have been thwarted by enacting sufficient austerity measures to bring the budget deficit down.",0,1340105311,null,0,false,0,c52kagr,t3_v9g7m,t1_c52kagr,t1_c52jy1u,null,1429177199,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

They're going to end up spending double on expenses and most of their time on traveling.

The problem then with promoting the Cardiff Assembly to a Parliament is 'are they going to have similar tax raising powers?', because with Scotland there is some sort of parity with money in and money out, and even then it gets complicated quickly.  With Wales however there is no such confusion; they're massively net beneficiaries of the Union with real geo-economic divisions.  Cardiff is having a renaissance, but Wales as whole is down against the UK on most other things.

They are chosen and answerable to Council and Parliament.

You should start switching you TV channels more often. FoxNews is not the only news channel around.

&gt;In case of the UK, if UK would come up and say that it is an close ally of US inside the EU, that too would be treasonous talk. However UK isn't an ally of the US inside the EU, US doesn't dictate to UK how to behave and impact the EU decision making.

That's doesn't make any sense at all. I said that Cyprus is the closest Russia's ally in the EU, meaning among the EU countries.* BTW you would have to be quite naive if you think that US have no influence on UK's foreign policies.*

&gt;European banks have already made big marks down in their investments to Greece, and I wasn't talking about stopping propping up Greece. I was talking that European tax payers shouldn't be responsible for irresponsible decisions made by the Cypriot state

That's right they shouldn't but the world is not a fair place. So they will.


&gt;for example loaning money from Russia: if Cypriot state goes bust, Russians should take the loss and not have the European tax payer pay them.

WTF with rusophobia again? Money is money. In fact Russian loan had much less conditions then EU's or IMF's alternative. And yes if Cyprus goes bust then no one will be able to force EU to repay Cyprus' debt to Russia. That's just not how the stuff works.

&gt;What I will say is that both US and Russia will have to make structural reforms and enact their own austerity measures sooner or later, both of the state are inefficient and waste resources.

US indeed likely will need to curb their spending. Russia on the other hand will likely increase their's.  Austerity is not the cure for everything. Different countries have different problems and solving all of them with austerity is like curing everything with aspirin. Again it's just not how things work.

&gt;The problem is that Cyprus is not enacting sufficient austerity measures to handle the crisis, but instead borrows more money that comes with questionable ties. If and when things go more wrong, it will be the EU and IMF that will be at the other end, and they have to sort the crisis out that could have been thwarted by enacting sufficient austerity measures to bring the budget deficit down.

Cyprus didn't had any problems with budget deficit. All they need is a bit of time to help their banks to diversify their portfolios away from Greece. And for that why they need a loan. ",0,1340107599,null,0,false,0,c52kjmy,t3_v9g7m,t1_c52kjmy,t1_c52kagr,null,1429177319,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Basically 1789 was not as much a Revolution as a transition from a Monarchy to a system similar to the one found in the UK now. You can't really start explaining it without going back to the roots of why the ""Tiers-Etat"" (basically everybody who was not royalty/aristocrat/clergy) started voicing its discontentment. More people attracted to the cities (easier for ideas to go around), too much taxes (especially on the farmers, who had already been throught drought and other disasters for some years), the aristocrats successfully disabling the access to nobless by recognition of one's work, a King no so much doing nothing as unable to do anything (and it was too late when he woke up and could have done something interesting). Mix everything and you have 1789, when philosophers and cultured individuals from both the Tiers-Etat, the Aristocrats and the Clergy got together and (I won't talk here about all that happened when everybody met at the Versailles castle but it is full of twists and turns) turned what was the political system of France in a system with the Constituant Assembly and a King. French were happy with this except for the Tiers-Etat who didn't get all they wanted (as usual, half-assed laws, it didn't change since then) and the French People decided that it was time to wipe all those well-off people from the face of Earth. And that's just what they did in 1792. The Assembly, however, was not even able to agree with itself as all kind of political ideals were represented in it, and that's pretty much how the Terror started.

I live in Quebec right now where the [recent student protest](http://www.forgetthebox.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/may-22-montreal-protest.jpg) turned into a protest into a [much larger general protest](http://vimeo.com/42848523) by the general population because the 2 electable parties, from what I understand, are both not perceived as electable.

Again, from what I understand, while they do have a green party here and a pirate party, voting for them is much more perceived as a waste for a vote.

I just took that as an example because I am witnessing it right now.

In this graphic you can see that the last 10-15 years has been relatively kind to people with the exceptions of Spain and Greece.

While this does not delve in to the details of youth unemployment it does show that the problem faced by each group is not as unique as it is assumed. 

Debt may be easier to get these days, but if well managed (on a personal and national level) it need not be a bad thing. Going back even to my parents day the number of people who went to university was a hell of a lot lower than it is today (about 10% I think, compared to nearly 40% now). The consequence is that someone has to pay for it, the state provides some support but if it is deisrable for more people to go then the recipients of the education can/should bear more of the cost.

Now imagine if the governments were to say they were cutting the number of university places to 10% and that the funding would be paid for. How do you think people would respond?

On a wider note of politicians and the economic wreck being created in Greece and the EZ well yeah, there's not much to say other than peopel tend to vote for their short-term benefit and to hell with the consequences. :(

&gt; No one foresaw the financial crash

Don't kid yourself, this crash was as obvious as it was preventable but those who said such things got ignored by those in power as nay-sayers and eurosceptics. It has always been a case of ""when"" rather than ""if"". 

The entire crisis would have been averted had the EU set out a decent fiscal stance and laid down laws/rules which would have been obeyed but even Germany and France made a mockery of it all with the Maastricht Criteria.

 Allowing cities to control their tax rates and income would be good, as it means they can invest to attract businesses they need, and spend the money to benefit these areas. It means the people in charge know the area and what it needs. But you could get areas with poor planners and people in charge, which in turn decline due to bad decisions.

It comes from Congrès de Tours in 1920 when SFIO split into two parties about the issue of obeying Comintern directives. Years later the two parties would be known as Parti Communiste Français (those who followed Moscow's tutelage and directives) and Parti Socialiste (moderate branch who refused direct allegiance to the Soviets). Parti Socialiste has abandoned many iconic ideas of revolutionary communism, like the final revolution (le Grand Soir), collectivization of every means of production or even annihilation of capitalism. 

Parti Socialiste is often perceived as a counter force to the profit obsessed elements of society. The idea behind it has been around for a long time, since starving Sans-Culottes have protested that they can't afford to buy bread indeed.

&gt;If the problems that you're expecting with a devolved English Parliament were likely to happen, or would happen in a significant manner, then you would expect them to of also occurred during the Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish devolutions. But they didn't.

Wait.  Scottish and Welsh MPs still sit in the House of Commons, but if what you're saying is that they now sit in a British Parliament and a national parliament it makes sense as to what you're saying in that they operate in both an English (geographically) and their own geographic parliaments but it most definitely does create problems.  Alex Salmond himself after coming First Minister struggled to keep up his attendance in both.  It makes sense for a Scottish minister under devolution to go to a different place even if it costs in terms of travel and output traveling between England and Scotland, but why accept that when talking about an English representative traveling between an English parliament and a British parliament both in England?

That, respectfully, doesn't address the need to move out of London, or how devolution max wouldn't be embracing some of the problems the EU faces with not enough central power.  The UK hasn't undergone devolution max, effectively EZ states have (although in reverse - they never evolved to a greater central power), and the UK doesn't have the problems the Euro Zone countries are now facing and trying to address.

There's a relevant argument that the UK as a whole investing in London leads to a greater good for the whole of the UK, which is probably true across the whole, but it will also lead to some areas becoming less competitive and a greater social divide.  IMO nothing wrong with giving more remote areas a margin of autonomy, nothing disproportionate, where one area might cater more to capitalise on its unrealised potential.  The major areas of commerce will still compete internationally and nationally, but whereas Leeds has capitalised on being a Northern alternative to London in certain financial regards I don't see the problem with doing the same for some of the smaller regional cities.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Most people I know don't think it would be a good idea. But to be honest most people don't care, just now at least - when the vote happens in 2 years time there'll be much more of a public discourse on it. 

Personally I would just be really interested to see what would happen so am marginally in favour for that reason if nothing else. While there are still questions to be answered on matters such as currency and the EU, from what I have seen we wouldn't suffer financially from it, and we would gain the ability to decide on all matters ourselves politically, which I don't think you can argue against. 

Scotland generally votes left just now while the UK as a whole often ends up with a Conservative government. As someone who wants to see more of a social-democratic line taken here it would suit me to have an independent Scotland pursuing that, but equally I think we'd see a resurgence of a conservative (small c) party after independence because the associations of the Conservatives (big c) would be gone, and a more even political spectrum as a result.

On the rare occasion I *have* talked to people about why they aren't in favour, their responses always tend to go along the ""we're too small, we're too poor"" argument which is increasingly being shown to not be the case as the debate unfolds - people aren't generally aware of the finances of Scotland and so the media shapes the discourse; in the past that has been very negative, but it has become more even and prone to showing that Scotland pays its way. 

In the end I think the majority will vote no, because they'll ask ""why do we actually need to do this?"", but I think the result will be a more far-reaching devolution settlement - David Cameron has already vaguely promised as such if a no vote is forthcoming but that has [proved a red herring in the past](http://www.newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-politics/4322-moore-echoes-douglas-homes-infamous-1979-promise-of-qsomething-betterq) (Newsnetscotland is a terribly biased site generally but that's the first link I could find on the story and it's ok).",0,1340124251,null,0,false,0,c52ny6s,t3_v9orj,t1_c52ny6s,t1_c52nldg,null,1429179022,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

No, it isn't, and Christmas is celebrated in every Christian country - which European countries are on the whole (yes debatable with levels of atheism but even an atheist like me and others celebrate christmas minus the hokey pokey jesus drivel - also former Yugoslavia etc). 

Also your definition of cultures seems to be based on race. In terms of culture you can travel within one European country and encounter 'different cultures'. And race-wise a Spaniard is very different to someone from Finland.

For example: What Americans believe to be German culture is actually southern Bavaria (Munich) - It is entirely different from say northern, eastern or west German 'culture'. And even those definitions would be too broad to form an all encompassing 'one culture' for that Geographic direction. 

You will not ever find a Northern German in Lederhosen with a giant mug of beer unless he's attending a summer fest in Southern Germany and is doing it as a gag.

Having said all that one of my favourite things is when Americans first come to Europe and notice the lack of advertising we have. 'How do people make money? How can things like UEFA make money if there aren't adverts plastered all over the screen and the game stopped to show commercials every 2 minutes?' 

Also them ordering a large coke at say McDonalds (omg it tastes like in America!) and complaining it's the size of a small one in the US. 

Last time I was in the states someone seriously asked me what it was like to be in a free country and whether I could smell freedom in the air. He wasn't kidding and was at least a fairly educated 40 something. The same guy was amazed to hear that we have a space agency and would not believe me when I mentioned a fair few 'transplanted' Germans worked on the US space program.

Ich zahle freiwillig in eine BuZ, ich sehe das nicht als Abzocke,sondern ein Mindestmass an Absicherung, da es für die Situation gar keine gesetzliche Leistung, auch nicht für Angestellte gibt. 

Und ich habe mich inbesondere selbständig gemacht und strebe nicht in eine Anstellung, um eben gerade nicht in die allgemeine Rentenkasse einzahlen zu müssen, aus der alle möglichen Sonderlasten beglichen werden, die aber ohnehin für nichts ausreicht, jeder kennt ja seine Statusmeldungen/Kontostände aus Berlin. Ausserdem strebe ich eine deutlich höhere Sparquote an, als dass mir das als Angestellter möglich gewesen wäre, um einen späten Berufseinstieg zu kompensieren. 

Übel wird der Gesetzesvorschlag im Herbst, wenn er nicht in Rechnung stellt, dass Selbständige stetig aus eigenen Einnahmen heraus ""in sich selbst"" investieren, in meinem Fall also durch entsprechende Zertis - die für Leistungsbezieher vom Arbeitsamt oder gelegentlich vom Arbeitgeber finanziert werden. Hier zahlen also wir Selbständige für etwas, dass an anderer Stellen mit Staatsknete und (früher mit Giesskanne) für die Bezieher vollkommen risikofrei verteilt wurde - daher finde ich es zynisch, wie jetzt vorgegangen wird. 

Ich als ehemaliger CDU-Stammwähler finde die sozialdemokratische Politik von der Leyens unerträglich. 

Meine Lieblingsforderung: Macht es so wie zB in Belgien: Da zahlen *alle* in die gesetzliche Rentenkasse ein, keine Ausnahmen. Also auch öffentliche Angestellte &amp; Beamte. Wenn sich die Gegner der Beitragspflicht diese Forderung aneignen, die auf die grobe Ungerechtigkeit, nämlich der geringen Abgabenlast der deutschen Beamten bei gleichzeitiger 120%iger Absicherung im Alter, hinweisen würde, wäre Ruckzuck Ruhe im Karton und die Planspiele wieder in der Schublade, da würde der Beamtenbund schon für sorgen.

To be fair I'm trying to address all the points irrespective of the poster, where there seems to be congruency.  If it's not directly relevant to the point you made, then I apologise, but please feel free to omit and to address the points that are.

&gt;I was just pointing out that, should there be an English Parliament, it would most likely the case that there would be different representatives in it than in Westminster.

Why?

The representatives we have deal with the quasi devolved states aside, vote on England and Wales, then the Union, and still run their constituencies.  All from Westminster.  I get why Scottish MPs need to return to Holyrood but why should English MPs already doing their job for England move, or have English MP secondaries?

&gt; It's not doing ""half the job"", it's doing a different job, with different issues to be considered.

Not really from the status quo.  British MPs elected in England still vote as is on policies that only effect England and Wales.

&gt;The argument that would likely be made about why to have it outside London would be symbolic, in that London is often seen to be the centre of everything, to the detriment of everywhere else, and having a Parliament elsewhere would help address that.

Well, to be fair, that somewhat addresses the 'why' although beyond symbolic, for what would be a considerable cost, the location is largely irrelevant.  It's still going to have south east MPs represented in similar numbers with similar interests.  I don't see how location makes much of a difference.

&gt;(And by the way - talking about ""Scottish MPs"" when you mean MSPs really confuses things - you should call MSPs MSPs and MPs MPs or else it's hard to tell who you are talking about.)

Calling it a myth is really pushing it. There isn't that many events of significance in history that have been more thoroughly documented. Much of what happened was done in the open and chronicled. (Even much recent events still have mysteries; for instance many WWII events are still not declassified and fully open. In particular national archives pertaining to the events leading to the defeat in 1940 are still, infuriatingly, not open to the public in France.)

&gt; In the case of french revolution, this story contribute to makes us think that we can always remove the power in place if they're doing a bad work. I think it is why we have so many strikes. If we're not happy with the current situation, we do a micro-revolution.

That's really not the most significant legacy. More important are the values that emerged and have been raised as ""sacred,"" if you will, not just in France but throughout Europe. Just to pick one example, it's sometimes forgotten but our healthcare system and the welfare state as we understand it in general are a legacy of the Revolution — it didn't appear _ex nihilo_ with the _sécu_ in 1945.

When you read those figures from the article, keep in mind that this is a 500kWp installation that has cost him about two million for the modules alone. (Going by his location, his annual returns, and feed in tariffs (€0.5130/kWh) as well as module prices (€3,85/Wp) from 2005. Not counting converters, connection to the grid, insurance, installation, maintenance etc. -- the total was probably closer to three million, and he has to pay interests on this loan.) That's still a good return, but the main beneficiary here was the then very young photovoltaic industry, and most of the current capacity has been installed much more recently and at lower feed-in-tariffs. Had he made the same installation today, he'd only get €0.1617/kWh, so about €70k/year. Then again, modules cost [much less](http://www.solarserver.com/service/pvx-spot-market-price-index-solar-pv-modules.html) nowadays.  
The plan was to grow an industry. Wacker is one of the largest producers of polysilicon, that factory they now built in Alabama probably wouldn't have been built in the first place without those feed-in-tariffs.

I learned a lot about that stuff in developmental and general psychology. Basically, a newborn baby has the ability to pronounce every phoneme that exists in the world. During the first year (and already in utero) the fetus/baby learns his/her mother tongue. 

If the baby is raised bilingual, it can learn 2 languages perfectly, this also works with 3 or more languages. 

However, the baby's brain simply drops the ability to pronounce phonemes that don't exist in it's environment. For example, children of Vietnamese families in German speak Vietnamese and German without any accent.  The have absolute no problem pronouncing R and L ;-)

No matter how hard you try, you will never lose your accent. And there is absolutely no problem with having an accent, be proud of it ;-)

[Denmark and the Euro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_and_the_euro)
&gt;Denmark uses the krone as its currency and does not currently use the euro, having negotiated an opt-out from participation under the Edinburgh Agreement in 1992. In 2000, the government held a referendum on introducing the euro, which was defeated with 46.8% voting yes and 53.2% voting no. The Danish krone is part of the ERM-II mechanism, so its exchange rate is tied to within 2.25% of the euro.

&gt;According to a history published by the central bank, ""Firstly, it was important to create a solid framework for price stability in the euro area, making it an appropriate anchor for the Danish fixed-exchange-rate policy. Secondly, Denmark had an interest in developing an expedient framework for exchange rate cooperation between the euro area and the non-euro area member states. Thirdly, Denmark had a general interest in the formulation of the ground rules for Stage 3 of EMU to ensure that Denmark would be able to adopt the single currency at a later stage on the same terms as those applying to the initial euro area member states.""",0,1340145791,null,0,false,0,c52tcvv,t3_van7d,t1_c52tcvv,t1_c52t7yv,null,1429181570,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;From Reuters:

Germany says did not discuss EU bond buying plan at G20 summit

There was no discussion at a G20 summit in Mexico this week about using Europe's rescue funds to buy up the bonds of stricken members of the euro zone, a German government official said.

British media reports on Tuesday said German Chancellor Angela Merkel was poised to use Europe's dual bailout funds, known as the EFSF and ESM, to buy up the debt of countries like Italy and Spain and had discussed the plans at the summit.

""Secondary market bond purchases are one of many instruments available to the EFSF and ESM,"" a German government official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

But he added: ""There was no discussion here in Los Cabos about any concrete intitiatives"" related to such purchases.

EDIT:

According to officials briefed on the discussions, Mario Monti, Italy’s prime minister, raised the possibility of using the eurozone’s €440bn rescue fund to buy peripheral bonds on the open market. But Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, was non-committal about the idea during a formal session on Monday night.
However, officials said Ms Merkel had subsequent conversations on the sidelines of the summit which led her interlocutors to believe “she may be willing to do more,” said one European official. The official cautioned, however, that Ms Merkel was not yet ready to commit to any definite course of action.

At the end of the school year, his English VASTLY improved but still cant speak fluent yet.

When it first started, it was hippies. Not even a derogatory meaning there, these were literally people the believed we should, on a national level, just stop using money and other ""capitalist tools"" and just help each other and live for each other and sing campy songs etc etc. It wasn't so much a protest as it was camping in downtown Manhattan (which actually sounds like fun). I don't think they should be given any realistic say in government, but they were harmless enough.(also I saw tits. yay!)

Then the damned cops got involved. The protest was down to 200 hard core not-willing-to-leave ideologues, and instead of letting it die, the cops beat them and pepper sprayed them. This is where the original protest actually died. Now it was a news event. Suddenly people cared. The thing is, the news sucks. Everything was vague enough that you could see in the protest anything you wanted to see. Every asshole with any slightly left wing grievance could show up and be accepted. For lack of more in-depth journalism, the occupy movement became the ""liberal mans tea party."" Personally I was never really in favor of the content of the protest, but it seemed to give the police a hard time. So fuck the police. In a sense the protest worked in that it bought notions of equality into the national discussion (which had been previously dominated by firebrand republicans). 

Of course, like all media events occupy eventually died down. The movement isn't quite dead, you can still find them in Union Square and Washington Square parks.

Whether the idiom spoken by the Macedonians is ""a separate language"" or ""a dialect of Serbian or Bulgarian"" is more of a political discussion than a linguistic one.

No, investors have to place their money *somewhere*. They can't simply get it in cash and sew into their mattresses. :) Or actually they could, but that would still be more risky for many, given exchange rate fluctuations, so all the same.

&gt; ##Lettre ouverte à Valérie Trierweiler : texte de Bernard Debré
&gt; 
&gt; *Publié le 16 juin 2012 99*
&gt; 
&gt; ###TRIBUNE LIBRE DU PR. BERNARD DEBRÉ 
&gt; 
&gt; Madame,
&gt; 
&gt; Lorsque vous êtes apparue aux côtés de François Hollande, après qu’il eut quitté Ségolène Royal, les citoyens français ont accepté votre présence, certains avec interrogation, d’autres avec un petit sourire, mais la plupart avec gentillesse. En France, l’amour est roi et les nouveaux couples qui se forment, surtout en politique, attirent plutôt la bienveillance.
&gt; 
&gt; Nicolas Sarkozy avait bénéficié de cette même « grâce » lorsque Cécilia était partie. Il s’en était expliqué, peut-être un peu trop, en conférence de presse et s’était marié avec Carla Bruni. Autre temps, autre mœurs, diriez-vous. Effectivement, qu’il s’agisse du général de Gaulle avec « tante Yvonne », de Giscard d’Estaing et d’Anne-Aymone, de François Mitterrand et de Danielle ou même de Jacques Chirac et de Bernadette, ces femmes versaient plutôt dans le caritatif discret que vers l’émergence people tapageuse.
&gt; 
&gt; Il est vrai cependant que la presse, pour François Mitterrand, a laissé tomber un manteau de discrétion sur sa double vie qu’il n’a révélée qu’à ses dernières heures. Déjà, il paraissait (mais qui a osé en parler ?) tout à fait anormal que sa deuxième « épouse » et sa fille soient prises en charge par l’État : appartement officiel sur le Quai Branly, voitures, chauffeurs, gardes du corps, cuisines et cuisiniers.
&gt; 
&gt; Bref ! Les frasques de François Mitterrand, gardées secrètes par des journalistes complices, ont coûté quelques 8 à 10 millions d’euros au budget de l’État
&gt; 
&gt; Carla Bruni n’a pas agi dans ce sens ni Bernadette Chirac. Mais vous voilà arrivée et avec vous, comme le dit la gauche, la modernité, ringardisant tout ce qui s’est passé avant.
&gt; 
&gt; Après tout, François Hollande a le droit d’avoir comme amie qui il veut et le temps qu’il le désire. Quant au titre de « première dame », il est usurpé. Ce statut n’existe pas et a été monté de toutes pièces par des journalistes avides de sensationnel. Vous n’avez, Madame, aucune existence légale d’autant plus que vous n’êtes ni mariée, ni pacsée. Que dirait-on d’un président de la République qui accumulerait les « premières dames » comme on accumule des amies ou des flirts ?
&gt; 
&gt; Vous avez néanmoins exigé d’avoir autour de vous une équipe composée d’hommes et de femmes qui vous suivent, qui vous aident, qui travaillent avec vous et qui sont payés par l’État. Au nom de quoi l’État doit-il s’occuper de votre secrétariat pléthorique ? Ce n’est pas, je pense, pour vous aider à écrire des articles dans votre journal « Paris Match ».
&gt; 
&gt; Voici un autre problème. Vous vous réclamez, à juste titre, du statut de journaliste et vous désirez continuer à écrire. Au début de la campagne présidentielle et même, si je ne me trompe, dès l’élection de François Hollande, vous avez clamé haut et fort que vous ne renonceriez pas à écrire dans l’hebdomadaire « Paris Match » et vous avez même annoncé que vous alliez interroger les grands de ce monde pour faire des papiers de politique étrangère ! Journaliste oui, mais journaliste politique non !
&gt; 
&gt; Il me semble que ce métier est incompatible avec la fonction que vous aimeriez avoir, même si elle n’est pas officielle. Vous avez donc décidé de faire du journalisme de bavardages pour bien montrer votre autonomie par rapport à votre ami François Hollande. Vous avez néanmoins accepté, demandé, peut-être même exigé de l’accompagner dans ses voyages officiels. A quel titre ? Simplement d’amie !
&gt; 
&gt; Il y avait et il y a toujours un obstacle : Ségolène Royal ! Vous ne la supportez pas, elle qui est pourtant mère des 4 enfants de François Hollande. Il semblerait qu’à la Bastille, lorsque François Hollande a « claqué une bise » sur les deux joues de Ségolène Royal, vous ayez exigé qu’il vous embrasse sur la bouche pour montrer la différence de statut ! Cet acte était sinon puéril du moins cruel.
&gt; 
&gt; Voici maintenant qu’en femme moderne, vous tweetez. Vous avez réussi, par vos bavardages, à ébranler la campagne électorale et à ridiculiser la France.
&gt; 
&gt; Ségolène Royal est candidate, certes parachutée, en Poitou-Charentes. Elle affronte Monsieur Falorni, implanté localement depuis de nombreuses années et ami de François Hollande. Il était naturel que les caciques du Parti socialiste viennent à son secours, elle qui avait été la femme candidate à l’élection présidentielle de 2007.
&gt; 
&gt; Il était peut-être moins évident que le président de la République se mêle de ces élections. En Président « normal », il avait annoncé qu’il n’y participerait pas. Les Français avaient d’ailleurs compris que le petit mot de soutien à Ségolène Royal était plus affectif que politique. Elle avait été sa compagne pendant si longtemps.
&gt; 
&gt; Mais vous ne la supportez pas, taraudée par la jalousie. Après le ridicule de « embrasse moi sur la bouche » que, semblait-il, vous aviez prononcé, voici maintenant la trahison ! En effet, de quoi vous mêlez-vous en soutenant Monsieur Falorni qui, au demeurant, reste très sympathique ? Est-ce en tant que journaliste politique que vous prenez position pour un candidat ?
&gt; 
&gt; Il s’agirait là d’une déviation intolérable de la neutralité politique d’un journaliste. Voyez-vous Monsieur Jean-Michel Apathie, Madame Ruth Elkrief, Monsieur Alain Duhamel prendre position pour qui que ce soit ? Ils devraient rendre immédiatement leur carte de presse, s’inscrire à un parti politique et ne plus parler. Certes, beaucoup de journalistes, beaucoup de journaux, sont à gauche et l’ont montré lors de ces dernières élections. Mais vous, Madame, journaliste à « Paris Match », vous n’auriez jamais dû prendre position. Ce n’est donc pas comme journaliste que vous avez envoyé ce tweet, vous êtes trop intelligente pour tomber dans un tel piège.
&gt; 
&gt; Est-ce pour affirmer votre indépendance vis-à-vis de votre compagnon ? Peut-être aussi pensiez-vous affirmer l’importance de la liberté de la femme ? Je ne le crois pas non plus car je ne suis pas sûr que la liberté consiste à faire des gaffes. Peut-être ce mot est-il trop faible ? Il s’agit d’une faute grave. En réalité, vous ne pouviez pas imaginer une seconde que Ségolène Royal, élue, puisse un jour arriver au fauteuil de présidente de l’Assemblée nationale. « Comment cette femme, qui était avec mon ami auparavant, qui a vécu si longtemps avec lui, peut-elle revenir en pleine lumière ? ».
&gt; 
&gt; Mais, pire encore, vous imaginiez, dans vos rêves les plus épouvantables, dans les cauchemars les plus terribles, les cérémonies officielles présidées par François Hollande obligatoirement accompagné par Ségolène Royal, en tant que quatrième personnage de l’État. Vous cauchemardiez à l’idée de voir ces grands dîners à l’Elysée, ces dîners officiels où votre place était équivoque, alors que Ségolène, rayonnante, aurait été proche de votre ami par la grâce du protocole. D’ailleurs, c’est pour cette raison déjà qu’à La Rochelle, vous aviez exigé, semble-t-il, que François Hollande parle de vous comme de « son unique amour ». Petite flèche empoisonnée dans le dos de Ségolène Royal.
&gt; 
&gt; La France, par ce tweet, a été ridiculisée dans le monde entier. Une si petite phrase ayant de telles conséquences ! Vous avez non seulement desservi la France où vous n’avez aucun rôle à jouer même si vous avez accompagné François Hollande dans ses voyages officiels à l’étranger (ce qui, déontologiquement, diplomatiquement, était déjà une extravagance), mais vous avez desservi le président de la République élu par une attitude grotesque de femme jalouse qui se mêle de politique pour entraver la carrière de son ami ou compagnon.
&gt; 
&gt; Vous avez ridiculisé et humilié les femmes des autres présidents français qui, elles, faisaient de l’humanitaire. Vous avez, semble-t-il, balayé d’un revers de la main ces actions remarquables qu’elles avaient menées et, par conséquent, vous avez méprisé tous ceux qui, en France ou ailleurs, ont consacré leur vie aux enfants, aux handicapés, à ceux qui étaient atteints du SIDA, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Bref, ce petit tweet de rien du tout a été le révélateur, Madame, d’un malaise que les Français n’osaient pas admettre, qui mélange la faiblesse du président de la République et la méchanceté de sa compagne.
&gt; 
&gt; Acceptez, Madame, mes sentiments mêlés de tristesse, de rage et de surprise.

I call it a myth not to refer to the way it's documented, but because of how this is a romanticized story for a lot of people. For sure historians know exactly what happened, how and why, but that's not the point here. We're talking about a popular story, something like Snow White or the big bad wolf. A story that is told to children and which will help shaping their ideology and way of thinking.

That's what I call national myths. The story peoples from a country like to refer to when they think about their history. I find it's really illustrating the ""average"" way of thinking of a population.

&gt; That's really not the most significant legacy

I don't agree. Ask random people in France about french history. I think that you will mostly hear about :

 * Jeanne d'Arc
 * Louis XIV
 * French revolution
 * Napoléon
 * Charles de Gaulle and WWII.

From this, you can shape the global history timeline for most peoples :

""It was middle-ages, we had a lot of war. It went all the way to the apogee of kings with Louis XIV, and because they went to far, the Revolution occured. Hopefully, Napoléon arrived, went to war against all Europe to spread democracy. And then there was the WWII and we were saved by De Gaulle.""

This is I think what a middle schooler know more or less of history. It's also what people who don't care about history know. That's a majority I think.
From this you can understand some of the ""French"" keypoints :

 * We wait for providential men to resolve our problems. (Jeanne d'Arc, Napoléon, De Gaulle)
 * If the situation isn't like we want, we will put the governement down. (French Revolution)
 * Our ideas have been spread around the world, everybody takes us as model. (Napoléon)

Je me suis souvent demandé pourquoi on ne mettait pas ce type de système en place sur une autoroute complète : grâce à l'horodatage, on connait l'heure d'entrée et l'heure de sortie, on connait la distance parcourue, on est donc capable d'établir la vitesse moyenne du véhicule, et donc d'estimer, en laissant une marge d'erreur suffisante bien sûr, la vitesse moyenne du véhicule. Reste le problème des temps de pause : le type qui roule à 150km/h mais s'arrête toute les 120 minutes (même si ce genre de personne généralement ne s'arrête pas), ça va fausser le calcul. Solution simple : il faut mettre des barrières à l'entrée des aires de repos, pour décompter ce temps du temps de trajet.

When you bump into tourists in London you can often tell which ones are American because you can hear them well before you can see them. I've also been astonished at the level of ignorance of some Americans about the world outside the US. This includes otherwise bright people I have met from the US saying really incredibly silly things. However, this is not true for *every single American*, just enough of them for it to be a *thing*.

I think a lot of people have had those experiences, which results in the very lazy stereotype ""Americans are fat, loud and stupid"". I would add, that anyone with their head screwed on *knows* that it's just a stupid stereotype, and doesn't really believe that all Americans are actually ""FLS"".

I wouldn't blame the high electricity prizes in Germany on the renewables. Prizes have risen before that too, because we have an oligopol of producers that wanted to maintain their excessive gains. In fact, the renewables help to reduce the electricity prizes at the exchange market.

What has to be done now is to do more research in energy storages. and grids need to be built.

true,Y2JisRAW,null,null,"So, ich werde den Inhalt des Textes erzählen. Der Text handelt von Thomas. Thomas erinnert *sich*, dass seine Eltern und *er* Ferien in CSSR machten. Als plötzlich die Möglichkeit bestand, dass sie in den Westen kommen konnten. Die Eltern diskutierten die Möglichkeit wie die anderen aus dem Campingplatz(?). Thomas verfolgte das Gespräch. Er erinnert nicht *an* das ganze Gespräch, aber er erinnert *sich an* das kribbelige Gefühl in seinem Bauch, weil er gern die schönen Sachen im *Westen* haben wollte. Der Vater wollte *gerne* die Chance nutzen, aber Thomas’ Mutter war skeptisch. Auf Seite 8, Zeile 27 bis 29 steht es: Ich will diese Stücke vorlesen. Trotzdem beschlossen sie nach Prag zu fahren. Sie konnte nicht ihre Sachen mitnehmen. Sie gingen mit zwei *Taschen* und warteten vor dem Zaun. Plötzlich kletterten zwei Männer über den Zaun. Der Vater rief, dass sie über den Zaun klettern sollten. Aber die Mutter sagte, dass sie nicht wollte. Sie ging mit Thomas und wartete eine Stunde auf Thomas’ Vater. Thomas erinnert *sich*, dass er *seine Mutter sehr feige fand*. Danach wurden Thomas und seine Mutter von der Staatsicherheit vernommen. Thomas’ Mutter hatte nicht mehr die Arbeit als Textilingenieur. Endlich kam die Wende – Thomas fieberte dem Tag *entgegen*, *and dem* er seinen Vater wieder sehen würde. Aber erst nach drei Jahren meldete er sich *am* Telefon. Thomas’ Mutter wollte ihn nicht sehen. Thomas verstand warum, aber jetzt wollte der Vater gern Thomas sehen. Thomas beschloss ihn zu treffen. Nach dem Treffen fragte Thomas den Vater, warum er *sich* nicht nach der Wende gemeldet hatte. Der Vater erzählte, dass er wütend war, und in den ersten *Monaten* ging es *ihm* nicht gut. Lager, arbeitslos, allein.(?) Der Vater erzählte unter anderem, dass es immer schwerer *sei* mit der Mutter und Thomas zu reden und er *viel* von der Welt gesehen hatte. Zum Schluss steht es auf Seite 12, Zeile 24 bis 26. Ich will diese Stücke vorlesen. 

Ich möchte jetzt eine Analyse machen. Wir befinden uns in Deutschland vor und nach der Wende. Die *Zeit* des Texts variiert. Am Anfang befinden wir uns nach der Wende, danach haben wir einen Flash und wir befinden uns vor der Wende. Zum Schluss sind wir zurück nach der Wende. Am Anfang wohnen Thomas und seine Eltern in *der* DDR. Die Erzählung ist in dritter Person (**sounds better**). Das Problem der *Geschichte* ist die Mauer. Die Mauer zwischen West und Ost und die psychische Mauer zwischen Thomas’ Mutter und Thomas’ Vater.

Jetzt will ich *gerne* eine Personencharakteristik machen. Die *Geschichte* hat drei Personen: Thomas und seine Eltern. Thomas ist ein junger Junge(?). In der Schule ist er ein Held unter seinen Freunden, weil sein Vater geflohen *ist*.

Thomas’ Mutter heißt Katja. Katja ist ein bisschen unsicher, weil sie nach Prag fährt und *sich* anders besinnt. Aber sie ist doch immer noch eine *entschiedene* Frau, weil sie nicht ihren Mann sehen will.

Thomas’ Vater ist auch entschieden. Er ist, wie die Mutter, ein bisschen egoistisch, weil er Thomas und Katja im Stich gelassen hat.

Der Text hat viele Botschaften. Eine Botschaft ist, dass es verschiedene *Mauern* gibt: Die physischen und die psychischen Mauern. Obwohl die Mauer zwischen Ost- und West-Deutschland weg ist, gibt es trotzdem eine Mauer - die unsichtbare Mauer zwischen Thomas’ Eltern.

Der Text ist relevant, weil wir alle die unsichtbare Mauer haben. Ich persönlich meine, dass wir eine *Mauer* zwischen *den* Einwanderer und *den* Dänen haben. Wir haben *Angst* und darum haben wir eine Mauer. Das kann man in vielen *Debatten* sehen. Zum Beispiel die Tuch Debatte.

Sooooo this is the first version of this guide... let's call it “When in Rome 0.0” hope you'll enjoy doing what romans do when in Roma! 

Apart from the landmarks (Colosseo/Imperial Forums/Palatine hill, St.Peter, Piazza di Spagna, Fontana di Trevi, etc...) I can suggest the following things off the most beaten path: 

**-Caelium hill**, just on the back of Colosseo, it's a peaceful spot not so tourist crowded. There are some good churches ""Santa Maria in Domnica"", [""Santo Stefano Rotondo""](http://www.santo-stefano-rotondo.it/), ""Santi Giovanni e Paolo"", there's a nice little park called ""Villa Celimontana"", a good complex of roman houses to visit called [""Case romane del Celio""](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_romane_del_Celio)  and the [""Clivus Scauri""](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clivus_Scauri) a piece of old roman road that links togheter most of the churches/places I mentioned before. Ah! Don't miss ""San Clemente Church"" just 5 mins from the Colosseo, ia three layered church close to the Colosseum. Great experience to understand the layering of different ages in the city. Basically it's a church built on a older church, built on a roman mythraeum. Ah for extra nerdiness points, the middle church has a fresco with the first comic ever depicted, it's about the miracles of san Clemente and the characters speak as in comics. First ever! (It even has some bad words, ""traite fili de le pute!"" (pull you sons of bitches!) yes, there's sons of bitches written on a church wall!).

**-Aventine hill**, green and peaceful, just on the other side of ""Circus Maximum"", one of the most wanted areas for rich romans to buy an house within the walls. Here you can visit the old and well preserved paleochristian church of ""Santa Sabina"" and next to it there's a nice little park called ""Parco degli Aranci"" (his official name is parco Sabelli) that has a good panorama on Trastevere. Other good churches here are ""Sant'Alessio"" and ""Sant'Anselmo"". Just between these two churches, in ""Piazza Cavalieri di Malta"", there's the [famous keyhole](http://i.imgur.com/2YIte.jpg), can't miss a peek from it! It's easy to spot since there's always a police van just next to it. 

-Not far from Aventino there's **Testaccio**, there are no particular landmarks here, except from ""Monte dei Cocci"" a hill made entirely from pieces of broken amphorae from the nearby roman port (that is no more). This area is great for its nightlife and fabulous restaurants, and because it has a very popular feeling. There's even a traditional farmer's market there good to grab something to eat on the go! 

-Going east at the end of ""Via Marmorata"" (the road used to transport marble) that runs between Aventino and Testaccio, you can spot the **Piramide**, a true pyramid built by a rich roman merchant who wanted a fancy tomb. The pyramid shares space with the acattolic cemetery, or as we call it [""Cimitero degli Inglesi”](http://www.cemeteryrome.it/about/about.html). Despite its dark function it's indeed a great place, here there are the tombs of Keats, Shelley and loads of other famous artists/writers who died in Rome, it's even the house of many stray cats, some lovely ladies own a famous cat shelter there, I got one of my cats there too!  

**Garbatella** just next to Testaccio and Piramide, is my neighborhood, I was born and raised here, even Ghandi visited it, you can find great places to eat and it's absolutely tourist-free, http://www.romeartlover.it/Garbatel.html It's like a village in the heart of Rome, expecially Piazza Benedetto Brin!

**-Going south there is E.U.R.**, easy to reach with ""Metro B"" don't know how much you are into modern architecture, but this zone is great for rationalist architecture, it has a ""square coliseum"" called ""Quadrato della Concordia"" and many buildings made according to renew the greatness of ancient roman empire (at least that's what Mussolini wanted to do) here's where you'll find the ""museo della Civiltà Romana"" with its famous [scale model of ancient Rome](http://www.flickr.com/photos/italianjob17/3547703463/) last but not least, “Viale Europa” and “Euroma2 mall” are great places for shopping. 

-Not really unknown but really worth a visit for its WTF value... the **Crypt of Cappuccini** at the beginning of Via Veneto/Piazza Barberini. Think about decorating with bones of dead monks a crypt... More [infos here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capuchin_Crypt).

Find me a period in time when they weren't.

&gt; they are largely responsible for getting us in this mess in the first place

They really aren't. They're a very convenient scape goat for politicians though also they are incredibly easy targets. Like any complexs narative there is much more devil in the detail than the headline ""evil bankers"".

&gt; there are treaties in place. Well let's change the fucking treaties. If there was the will to do it, it would be done.

Eh, heard of this little thing called ""democracy""? Between the European Conssitution and the Treaty of Lisbon there has been a dwindling support for further European integration even amongst the core countries like Frace. Good luck on getting a popular mandate to effectively force through federalism. 

&gt; But so many politicians are cosied up to lobbyists and senior bankers that they pretend their hands are tied.

True, but we - yes *we* the people have only ourselves to blame for disengaging in politics and not holding out politicians to account for their failings. We let robber-barons run countries - Chirac, Berlesconi to name but two.

Be careful some of these places don't accept credit cards!): 

**RESTAURANTS**


**""Perilli"" in Testaccio** area, precisely in via Marmorata, 39, great at lunch, for dinner it gets crowded, true roman cuisine, not cheap, I'd say normal prices. 

**""Gigetto al Portico d'Ottavia""** in the Ghetto zone, just behind the synagogue there's a fabulous little neighborhood that used to be (and still is) the jewish zone. The area is great for a walk and is where the true roman culinary masterpieces were born, the ""carciofi alla giudia"" (jew-style artichokes) are a must of our kitchen, Giggetto makes the best roman ""supplì"", great baccalà fritto (fried cod), ""vignarola"" (salad of artichokes, peas and fava beans) and all the best of our tradition, made as time had stopped. http://www.giggetto.it/index.html price/quality is balanced here. 

**""Augustarello"" in Trastevere** (trastevere is literally FULL of places to eat/drink, some of them are tourist traps, and you could pay 60€ for a basic meal! Augusto is said to be the King of Trastevere and has really normal prices, apart from being historical!) http://www.tripadvisor.it/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d1717793-Reviews-Da_Augusto-Rome_Lazio.html 

**""Ar Grottino der Traslocatore""** Garbatella, largo delle Sette Chiese, you have to look behind the kiosk and you'll see some stairs going down, that's the entrance, the place is small but the food is really GREAT, the portions of pasta are unbelievable (ever seen a mountain of spaghetti? http://www.youtube.com/user/cavolett#p/u/24/heyInkAaeu8 ), the ""Cacio e Pepe"" is wonderful, so are the ""Saltimbocca alla romana"" and many other dishes"" the prices are very reasonable. 

**""Da Benito""** in via dei falegnami 14, just between the archeological area of ""Largo Argentina"" and the central ""Piazza Venezia/Campidoglio"" what can I say... a MUST for LUNCH (it closes in the late afternoon) this is the LAST TRUE Roman Hosteria! The prices are unbelievably CHEAP, the atmosphere is like you step into a time-travel machine! The house wine is very good and the food too (don't miss ""bucatini all'amatriciana"")!! Some pictures here: http://imagoromae.blogosfere.it/2006/03/da-benito.html 

**PIZZERIE:** 

**""Pizzeria Panattoni/ Ai Marmi""** but romans call it ""L'obbitorio"" (the morgue!) in Trastevere, Viale Trastevere 53, is a tradition, is called morgue because it has marble tables like those used once in morgues... Supplì (oily but great!), bruschette, fiori di zucca, filetti di baccalà, olive ascolane. Pizzas are thin and very good (Roman style! Thick pizzas are Naples style). The place gets quite crowded for dinner. 

**""Remo"" in Testaccio**, piazza S. Maria Liberatrice 44, great authentic roman style pizza and more, great prices, it gets very crowded for dinner too... http://www.tripadvisor.it/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d781235-Reviews-Pizzeria_da_Remo-Rome_Lazio.html 

**""Da Baffetto""** near ""Piazza Navona"" Via del governo vecchio, 114 always crowded, most of times you can find it because you spot the queue outside... used to be really great, now it's more touristy but still good and with good prices, the worst is the waiting... to get a seat and to get served! 

**FOOD TO GO/QUICK LUNCH:** 

**""Frontoni, since 1921""** on Viale Trastevere 52, next to the Oviesse department store, their “pizza bianca” can raise the deads! A MUST!!! Really, you'll thank me! More infos and a good review in english is available here: http://reallyrome.com/blog/2007/07/12/quick-lunch-at-frontoni/ 

**""Er Filettaro""** a true Roman institution... just behind the famous “Piazza Campo de' Fiori”, in Largo de' Librari 88. It's mostly famous (and takes its name) from the “filetti di baccalà” (fried cod stripes) still done like those that ate my grandad there, for 5€ you can get the biggest, better and tasties filetto di baccalà in Rome, absolutely WONDERFUL! At “er filettaro they also do some other dishes (not so much stuff indeed but everything is top-notch for quality and tradition) as “Da Benito” the atmosphere is very very “as it used to be 50 years ago”, and with good weather there are some wooden tables outside to enjoy your meal seated in the little piazza. 

**”Pizzeria 00100” in Testaccio**, Via G. Branca 88, just on the right of S. Maria Ausiliatrice church (the only church of Testaccio, in the main square, can't miss it there), this is where tradition meets half-way with modernity. In this place they took the famous dishes of roman culinary tradition and adapted them to a “to go” concept. Basically they prepare some pizza bianca triangles, cut them and fill them up with roman dishes! The Trapizzino (the name is half “tramezzino” half pizza) with Meatballs and sauce is UNBELIEVABLE!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_ANiY4zFAo 

**""200GRADI bread and condiments""** it's a GREAT sandwich maker in ""Piazza Risorgimento"" just between St.Peter and the Vatican Museums, http://www.duecentogradi.it/?lingua=en the bread and the fillings are incredibly fresh and top quality! And just round the corner from it there's a truly good gelateria. The sandwiches prices range from 4€ to 6€, and they prepare great salads too. 

**”POMPI il Regno del tiramisu”** the VERY best Tiramisu you could ever have in your life! Really, this is unmissable! Tiramisu comes in 3 flavors, traditional with chocolate chips, banana and Nutella, cream and Strawberries. They are sold in little boxes to go or can be eaten there if you're so lucky to find a table since every evening (except Monday when it's closed) it gets very crowded! They even have aperitivi, desserts and delicious gelato. Everything is top quality and very very fresh. Pompi is in Via Albalonga, 7 the nearest Metro station is RE DI ROMA, “A Line” (the red one).

[""Villa D'Este""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_d%27Este) 

[""Villa Adriana""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Villa) 

[""Villa Gregoriana""](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Gregoriana) 

These are all fabulous places to visit! Villa d'Este is a wonderful renaissance fountain park, and is the easiest to reach/see, Villa Adriana is quite big, but you can just go and see the best of it, Villa Gregoriana is truly amazing but is quite uphill and tiresome to visit. The main issue is that a day is not enough to visit them all (unless you plan to visit Tivoli japanese style, aka just a bite of the best and run to the next thing to see...) not even if you go to Tivoli renting a car. The best you can do without a car is to get the METRO B until “Ponte Mammolo” station, and there you get the blue regional bus (aka Corriera) N°6 to Tivoli (it leaves every 15 minutes) and see Villa D'Este (just few minutes away from the bust stop!) and eventually if you're a good walker, Villa Gregoriana too in the same day. If you're more into ancient roma instead go to Adrian's Villa which is not in Tivoli but on the plain below, just a bus ride away, you can ask the tourist office when in Tivoli, it is located in Piazza Garibaldi, just close to the main bus stop and Villa d'Este entrance. 

-Another great spot for a trip out of city is [**Ariccia**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariccia) 

This small village had the pleasure to have its center build from Bernini, (palazzo Chigi is truly beautiful!) but the hidden greatness of this village are the Fraschette, a wonderful way to enjoy a great dinner for a really cheap price! this area is famous for its wine and for the [Porchetta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porchetta). The Fraschette are small grottoes with wooden tables and a VERY popular atmosphere, you can have a full and incredibly fullfilling dinner with wine (red sparkling ""romanella"" is a must here!) for even less than 15€. All young (but even older) romans go here on Friday/Saturday evenings to eat drink and chant in a great atmosphere, often guitar/fisarmonica players will pass by the tables singing traditional roman songs, and all the people [sing along](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4BjOUjpCXI) [mostly drunk...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDBYIn2w7Ac&amp;feature=related) About other infos and getting there I found this nice website that deals with this matter in a great way, so being lazy I'll just give you the link: http://thetravelbelles.com/2010/07/a-favorite-day-trip-from-rome-ariccia/ 

**EXTRA:**

-In Italy Bus Tickets MUST be bought before getting on the bus. Tickets can be bought at news stands, tobacconists and some bars. 

-NEVER EVER buy water bottles (overpriced in the center and tourist areas), Rome water is great to drink! And you can always find a [“nasone” (big nose)](http://blog.libero.it/ROMANI/6472304.html) to drink and fill up your bottle with fresh water! [Map of nasoni](http://zef.homelinux.org/youpoi/) but there are MUCH more, even with other shapes! You can drink safely at all of them, if the water is not drinkable there'll be a sign saying “NON POTABILE” but this is a really rare case.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I know this is a narrative that Americans like to tell themselves, but it's not the whole story.

The first time I travelled to the states as something like an adult was 1990, when I was 15. I stayed there for a month, and the two most striking things about my stay were:

1) Not having a car is not an option

2) The total lack of any reported news outside of the United States in either print, or televised form. 

The latter was the bigger shock because I had no way of knowing what was going on anywhere else in the world. Not just the UK or Europe, but *anywhere else in the world*. It was like being trapped in an information bubble, and I found it really disturbing. When I did find ""foreign news"" it was usually in written form. It was cursory, and occupied a page or two rather than half the newspaper. Despite hours of searching, I couldn't find anything on the TV about what was going on outside the country. When I got back to the UK, it was like blinders had been lifted and I was finally able to see again. 

Nowadays, this is not as much of an issue for me when visiting the US because of the availability of news on the internet, but whatever odd psychological phenomenon allows Americans to walk through life without the slightest bit of curiousity about whats going on elsewhere on the planet, is still there.

Normally, banks lend to each other at a descent rate determined by offer and demand. The liquidity provided by this system is a way for banks to fund themselves. With this funding, the banks can lend money to businesses. And this is what keeps (should keep) our current economy going.

But what happened? Banks stopped trusting each other. They don't want to lend money to other banks because they are afraid that their loans won't be paid back (because the bank could go bankrupt).

This is the reason why the ECB has lent this large amount of money to banks at a very low rate. If not, banks would have problems with their funding and they couldn't lend anymore to businesses. This would stall the economy even more than what's now the case.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; if its so different from country to country please say and say what your personal countries usually do.

There are so many aspects of it, I don't even know how to start. There just are too many aspects, so I'll focus on Germany and France.

Say, two friends meet. How they greet each other depends on where you are, among other things (how close you are, how long you haven't seen each other, and so on). Here in Germany, it ranges from a simple ""hey"" to hugs, depending on circumstances. For two male close friends or relatives that haven't seen each other for a while, a short, well measured hug with the two pats to the back of the other's shoulder blade can be appropriate. Girls can do whatever they like. Compare that to France, where you kiss practically everybody you've met before (exaggerated for effect).

Or take restaurant culture. You won't have free water on the table in Germany, and if you order water it will be sparkling and you're expected to pay, unless you ask for tab water specifically. There might be bread, but that's rare. Btw., ""rare"", how you describe how you like your steak depends on where you are as well. When it's time to pay, the waiter will ask ""together?"" but won't mind at all if you pay separately, in which case she will strike off the items on the bill and add them up while everybody list what s/he had, then you round up for the tip and pay an even amount.  
In France, you'll have free water and bread on the table. When it's time to pay, the waiter will bring you the bill in a little bowl and go away. Then you (together, always) put the money into the bowl, which the waiter will then pick up and return with your change. You leave the tip in the bowl.

Now, where do you buy bread? You probably pick it up in the supermarket. It's white, soft, rectangular, and comes sliced, which you falsely believe to be a valid measure of greatness. We have that, too, only we call it ""toast"", in English, because it's an English thing and there's nothing else you could possibly want to use it for but to toast it. There are some pre-sliced factory breads on the shelves, and some fresh ones you can pick up and bag yourself, but usually you will buy it at the bakery stand that a local chain operates on the supermarket premises outside the normal check-out. There also are ""stand-alone"" bakery businesses, either independent or as part of a chain. There are two kinds, one for bread and one for cakes, often they're combinations. A bakery will have a range of different breads, with all kinds of different combinations of flour (wheat, rye, full grain, potato, with onion pieces, etc.), most of them sour-dough and relatively dense. Most bakeries will slice it for you if you want, but usually you buy it whole because it will stay fresh for days this way. They'll also have a variety of bread rolls, some of them small versions of bread, others of the more fluffy wheat kind, with or without stuff on them (sesame, puppy seeds, cheese, with pieces of ham inside, and so on), lye rolls (like soft pretzels, which you obviously can buy as well).

In France, they use different categories to differentiate between types of bakeries, and there are more of them. They're specialized on large or small cakes, bread and puff-pastry (many more kinds than just croissants, with chocolate, cheese…), or combinations thereof. Despite their admirable variety, most of the bread tends to be relatively soft and wheat flour based, and you'll have a hard time finding a decent dense rye bread that will sustain you for days. Instead, you pick up a fresh one on your way home. You know baguette, but that's far from the only long wheat bread.

Each year on New Year's Eve in Paris, German tourists meet on Montmartre, because they expect to have the best view on the fireworks from there. Only, the French don't have fireworks on New Year's Eve, they do that on their national holiday instead, whereas in Germany ours is basically just another day off from work.

Those were just a few random examples of cultural differences between only two countries that are right next to each other. Some differences are more subtle, like [how people communicate](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13545386), but I don't even have to go beyond national borders. There's plenty of cultural variety within individual countries.

Take those special times of the year and the traditions that go with them. We all have our presents under the Christmas tree on Christmas *Eve* (the 24th) in Germany, but during Easter, some regions decorate a tree in their village with painted eggshells. You might point to Mardi Gras in New Orleans as an example of regional cultural diversity in the US. In some parts of Germany, that festivity is hardly worth mentioning. In others it's the ""fifth time of the year"" and a very big deal. In [what way](http://blogs.transparent.com/german/files/2011/03/karneval50.jpg) depends on where you are, in some regions parades can are [political](http://www.weser-kurier.de/media/4217/16320628181113/show_0aft7wnb_1.jpg) and silly/embarrassing, in others they are [very traditional](http://www.bimberstube.de/spgm/gal/2008/2008_01_20_Fasnachtsumzug_in_Musberg/2008_01_20_fasnachtsumzug_in_musberg_09.jpg) (and an entirely different tradition than in the others).  
Of course, they're all occasions to drink. Traditions for special drinking occasions vary by region as well, and can be tied to practically anything. In parts of the North, [grünkohlessen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnkohlessen) is an occasion to load a handcarriage with beer and schnapps, tie a glass around your neck and go for a walk. This kind of drinking is popular for [other occasions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatertag#Germany) as well. In some areas, visiting friends and neighbors to very expressively admire their Christmas tree decoration in exchange for schnapps is the excuse they have come up with, other drinking traditions are so extremely localized that they are only occur in one village.  
What happens on the night to Labor Day (May 1st), if you haven't guessed already, depends on where you are. There might be a bonfire, or you could be out playing tricks on your neighbors. Or maybe you're in an area where they erect a maibaum (May Tree, a pole with a wrath with colored bands hanging off it at the top) to dance around, in which case you will try to steal the one from the neighboring village to blackmail them. And you get drunk, obviously.

I'm not even going to get into local food and dialects that may or may not me mutually intelligible, let me just say that its a myth that JFK could have been misunderstood to be a jelly doughnut. In Berlin, those are called *pfannkuchen*, which they of course got entirely wrong because this term actually is reserved for pan cakes. Jelly doughnuts are supposed to be called berliner, krapfen, kreppel, or something else, depending on where you are.

&gt; Do europeans have the same stereotypes that americans do of certain countries (ie. Britain thinking the French are snobs or something)

There are some that are widely accepted as fact, others depend on the region.

&gt; how many europeans actually back that americans are fat stupid loud etc?

We all do, out of principle, we just don't necessarily believe that it's true.

* United Kingdom	1.72%	
* United States	1.62%	
* Germany	        1.53%	
* Sweden	        1.51%

The countries with the higher yields carry a greater risk of default (hence the higher rate). Countries with a higher rate include:

* Greece	        26.43%
* Spain	                7.04%
* Italy	                5.91%

Sure you can get a nice rate of return on those bonds but would you invest your money in Spain right now?

The thing is that banks lack the confidence in the markets to do so. Not enough money goes to government bonds! They should buy more! Instead they search save havens for their money: German governments bond (at a real interest rate of almost -0.5%!) or the ECB deposit facility (at a nominal interest rate of 0.25%!).

Right now about 800bn euros is parked in the ECB deposit facility at a rate of 0.25%, money they lent from the ECB at a rate of 1%. This clearly shows the banks distrust the markets.

I'd say you won't have any problems because of this.

I got caught in June 2011, and the fine notification arrived last month, so don't worry about that.

The second reason why I think you won't get in trouble for this is that neither of you were properly ID'd. If they DID want to confirm your identity, neither a uni ID or a driver's license from other country are valid documents: Only Spanish DNI's and officially issued passports would do.

I'd be willing to bet the cop that busted you is now just smoking your hash, since it's certainly not worth the hassle and the mountain of paperwork it would take him to make you pay a fine like that from the other side of the ocean.

Once again: This is my opinion on the issue, I'm no lawyer or cop so I can't know for sure. Anyway, and you can believe me on this: petty drug possession like that is just a fine here, not a crime.

I'm not disputing the fact that the Macedonian nationality is a recent creation, or that the Macedonian language is closest to Bulgarian. But given the fact that all national identities are a thing of self-perception more than anything else, you cannot argue that a Macedonian identity exists, separate from that of the Bulgarians.

Nations are „[imagined communities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_communities)” after all.

&gt;It [Macedonian language] has not created by natural means, as all other languages in the world, but was created by political circumstances. It is an absurd, that it was created on a certain date – namely August 2nd, 1944, and at certain place – the monastery “Prohor Pchinski”, with a decree. Such an event has not happened to any other language in the world.

No, but to say there was some nirvana period where the average person was living the dream is false. the ""average"" person is always hard up.

&gt; fact the dangerously unregulated market is more to blame.

Have you seen the amount of legislation that banks have to adhere to in the EU? It's far from ""dangerously unregulated"". It'd more accurate to say it is poorly over-regulated.

&gt; But remember that banks lobby very strongly for such conditions, even though both the banks and the politicians were aware of the risks

And this is why in a better capitalist system we would ensure that the banks would fail and that the shareholders and bondholders took the hit rather than the taxpayer. Along side existing assurance policies for depositors there is little reason for socialising the losses of banks like the EU did.

&gt; So to say that ""they really aren't"" to blame, is at least as inaccurate as my statement.

Are you blaming them for the current mess in the Eurozone? In which case the banks have little to be blamed for. If you mean the earlier crisis in 2008 then yes there is some scope for assigning blame but in the context of what happened there are mroe important factors namely poor regulation, lousy ratings agencies and deluded economic policies by governments.

&gt; However, with our one vote every four years, there is not a lot we can do directly, short of revolution? What would you suggest?

Honestly, I think politicians should be legally accountable for their actions. The concept of ""presidential"" immunity which appears to still exist in some countries should be scrapped and in cases of corruption / incompetence then politicians should be in court.

Seriously though, if you really believe r/europe is predominantly anti-South, you're very much off target. I noticed that there seem to be certain times during the day and certain days in a week when public opinion swings one way or the other, but my own perception is that the subreddit as a whole is somewhat divided evenly. Also, your proposed log analysis doesn't help, unless you would assume every redditor from country X would always vote/argue in favor of country X's official policies, which would be ridiculous. The only way to really determine with some scientific plausibility the *political leaning* of r/europe would be by some kind of semantic/statistical analysis of the comments and upvote/downvote numbers on articles and in the discussions -- an incredibly complex task. I'd say, well within the scope of  a CompLing PhD. Good luck with that :P

And that's, in my opinion, simply because he's smart enough to know that it is one thing to debunk the idea that the EU rescue funds are equal in scope to the Marshall Plan (which is easy to do), but a completely different matter to argue in favor of, say, unconditional permanent Eurobonds (much harder to do).",0,1340195650,null,0,1340195905,0,c5322od,t3_v87hi,t1_c5322od,t1_c52jvnp,null,1429185769,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The wider production capacity is distributed, the better, and we need to get energy from those areas where the sun is shining to those where it doesn't, and we need to do the same for wind energy.

Da quando l'ho scoperto non frequento altro, se devo fare delle ricerche prima le faccio su google e poi per sicurezza le rifaccio su reddit.

Ho provato più volte a pubblicizzarlo agli amici, ma la risposta che ho sempre ricevuto è stata *Ma è tutto in Inglese non ci capisco niente!* – compresa la mia ragazza, che sa bene l'Inglese ma non ha voglia di leggerlo. 
Oltretutto reddit è menzionato poco e niente nei principali siti Italiani, c'è poco da fare, magari può capitare di vedere l'icona dell'alieno ( mai capitato al di fuori di siti stranieri ) ma non lo si soppesa neanche più di tanto. 
E poi ridendo e scherzando siamo in più di duemila, magari alcuni sono europei / americani / Italoqualcosa che si sono semplicemente iscritti al subreddit perché gli piace l'Italia oppure perché sono originari dell'Italia, ma non esclude che almeno l'80% di quei duemila sia composto da Italiani. Il numero cresce lentamente.. ma cresce! 

Ad ogni modo per me l'importante è che questo subreddit sia sempre abitato da persone che sappiano scrivere e che sappiano pensare.

But I want to ask sth. ok, it's obvious and pretty logical that I support the greek side of the argument. what do you believe it would be the right thing to do? you do see logic in those claims? would it be right to back off and accept the term Macedonia which defines a big period of our history and cultural heritage used as a part of an insane campaign against our territory?

Take Bulgarian for example. As somebody speaking the Standard Macedonian Language, I find Bulgarian barely intelligeble.

Starting with the last point, I would have no issue with EU officials overseeing economic policies in EU states. But they have to have a good professional record (meaning that they shouldn't be bankster sharks), be non-native (I just violated a few EU principles!), be randomly selected, and be installed in all EU states, not only in states violating Maastricht criteria. That means Greek EU officials in Germany, and German EU officials in Greece. Also, high-level EU positions should not be the result of political bargain between larger states (meaning that if France and Germany disagree, we'll not end up with another person from Belgium or Luxembourg), but the European Parliament should vote for them, and the votes should be weighted accordingly, for equal representation from all the EU states.

Regarding the practical solution, I'm partial to [Varoufakis-Holland's Modest Proposal](http://varoufakis.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/modest-proposal-3-0-may-2012.pdf) (pdf, you can start with page 3, point 3), with some adjustments.

So, do you think that Greece should also abstain from the name? I mean you guys even have a functioning army. At this point I have difficulty seriously considering this issue, especially after everything Macedonia has done to renounce its claims to territory held by Greece or Bulgaria. I don't think the Greek side really cares either, except for purposes of demagougery. Hell, one of the names that was seriously considered during the negotiations was North Macedonia, which always seemed like an irredentist's wet dream.

&gt;I can understand that FYROM is not a great name but you really have to find another since we live near and not in the other side of the planet.

Sorry, but it's about 100 years too late for that. Nobody who was born a Macedonian would vote to be called something else. National identities are even less malleable than politics and religion. I think at this point we (Macedonians) are certain Greece will lose the dispute within 20 years, and are just hoping to slip past into NATO and EU before that. Nobody is seriously considering a name change, and short of a Greek invasion or embargo are unlikely to start considering it.

If it had been a free-floating currency then it would have appreciated, not depreciated. Your central bank intervened heavily. Negative interest-rates to hinder the appreciation. It served the interest of your country which is not surprising. That it was not the government who explicitly made them do this, doesn't change the fact. That's probably why inflation was so high in the 2008-2010 period compared with the EZ.

There are always different interests that have to be balanced out, independent or not. I'm sure people on fixed pension didn't enjoy the inflation of 2008-2010.

Well, people who obey the letter of the law but not its spirit is what got us into this mess with regard to treaties. It sort of spiraled out from there. Trade and capital imbalances pushed it until it fell apart. The money that flowed in to the periphery from the rest of the EU increased asset prices, which lead to weaker borrowers being able to get collateralized loans. This somewhat like the adventure of the Swedish banks in the baltic. Money flowed out, asset prices fell and a banking crisis was at hand.

If more people would admit to this, maybe we could give EU a positive roll in fixing it.

I'm just going to correct you in few places. Tito came to power after WWII, and he didn't really care about Macedonia, he cared about keeping all nationalities in the federation somewhat happy. He probably also liked the fact that the Greek communists at the time were discussing giving back the rights to Macedonians in the newly occupied territory. Aegean Macedonia, came to be under Greek rule only after 1913 (Bucharest Peace Treaty - this is also when Bulgaria and Serbia got a land grab). As you know, the size of Aegean Macedonia is the same as the current Republic of Macedonia, so you can imagine our dismay at the time (well.. even today, but let bygones be bygones). The forced immigrations you speak of were mostly done by Greece (they moved settlers from far south to homogenize the new territory). Why would the Germans, Ottomans, or Bulgarians force people to move out? So the can bring people from their countries to settle the land instead? Occupiers need the domestic people to work for them... Lastly, Alexander did speak Greek (as well as ancient Macedonian - Rosseta Stone?, and as well as any other educated person at time, and as any other educated person spoke Latin after, etc.) and he did spread it to the rest of the world. He, (like me and most people), recognized the value of what your ancestors did, and thought it would be a good idea to spread that as far as possible. But, he never trusted Greeks, that's why he always appointed Macedonians to be his highest commanders (most of the Greeks in his court were not mainland Greeks either, the only high ranked Greek Eumenes got tragically punished for supporting Alexander in the wars of succession). Not only that, Macedonians were always considered barbarians by the Greeks (that's why they were never allowed to compete in the Olympics for example). The famous orator Demosthenes even wrote how it was unbearable to see Greeks suffering under the hand of a barbarian (talking about Philip), and urged the city states to rebell. Alexander first conquered the weakened city states of Greece before continuing his conquest east. This is why right after his death, the Greeks did rebell and took back their cities (Lamian War, Wars of Succession).

Lastly, Macedonian is not a race by the way.

I was really hoping you would come up with a good argument cause I love discussing about this, and it's difficult to find a reasonable person with whom to have this type of conversation. ""Fuck off sir, with all the respect, i , at least, speak the language of Alexander""? was the best you can come up? The fact that you find consolation in that is alarming, I would reconsider my priorities if I were you. Unless you're a great study of history, the Greek language is irrelevant today probably as much as Macedonian.

true,roflburger,UNSA,United States,"you are shortsighted then.  The civil war wasn't a mistake.  It was punctuation.  Punctuation at the end of an era where we found out the hard way that a system of rival and robust states in Union didn't work.  The civil war wasn't planned or desired by leaders or the people at the time.  It was a forgone conclusion because people thought the way you did.

Let me break it down further because you do not seem to have been educated in political systems.  Such a large system needs a dominant federal side?  the reason for this is mainly electoral in nature.  Elections for local officials are mainly won on what you can bring to the state, not the country as a whole.  For that reason the legislature is run by people who's sole motivation is to bring funds and favorable condition to their district and their district alone.  They will refuse to make bills unless their pork project is included.  This means that for every law for the good of the EU, it will come with 50 public works projects or tax breaks riding along.  

the people as a whole will complain when the budget spirals but it will never change?  Why is that?  because the congressman is only accountable to the voters from the small area that benefited from the pork spending.  So they will do it again and again until the state goes broke.  Declare the government insolvent, and eventually secede from the union as an enriched area being ""dragged down"" by the financially irresponsible federal system.  This happens without fail in loose federal situations.  You wouldn't be any different, even if you think such behavior is impossible for European politicians.

So how do you solve this?  Rules and institutions. The SEC, Budget Accountability Office, EPA, Department of Natural Resources etc.  Run by educated people with the scope of the whole nation in mind.  That is how you become efficient.  That is how you grow your government to regulate for the good of the greatest amount of people.  But these institutions are worth fuck all if they can not overrule state decisions.

In the US model:  State wants to dump waste in the river to boost industry while screwing over the states down river?  EPA:  Fuck you cant do it.

State wants to tax out of state businesses more to protect in state companies?  SEC:  Fuck you, can't do it.  

In the end of the day, the states are still in competition and the only thing to keep them unified is a strong federal government.  They won't play fair on goodwill.  And you are seeing this now.  Greece wants bailouts.  Germany wants a weak dollar.  The rich countries (switzerland and Norway) refuse to join at all.  France wants to protect its farmers and Turkey just wants in.

true,roflburger,UNSA,United States,"i just made a long reply of why federalization is the only logical end, so i would suggest you read that.  More specifically to the mistakes though:

First mistake, was US allowed states to have separate currencies.  This led to barriers to trade and inflation and general confusion.  It was bad.  SO we learned that currency union was necessary.

Another mistake was in wealth distribution.  During the great depression many states were hit harder than others.  With the New Deal and Tennessee Valley Authority we learned that wealth distribution, while despised for the richer states will help the economy immensely and prevent poverty from spilling over everywhere else.  

Lack of wealth distribution also held the US back a lot because of infrastructure.  The federal mandate to have post offices roads and electricity in rural areas was a huge boon to the US economy.  The richer states hated it and the poor ones couldn't afford it, but the infrastructure proved to be a vital part of US growth and would never have happened under a loose confederation of states.

The Nullification Crisis of 1832 where southern states refused to pay new taxes that benefited other states at the expense of their own.  Sometimes laws are not good for part of the union but help the rest of it so much that a part of it will be necessarily be against it.  You can either assert federal power at this point as we did or allow states to pick and choose which laws to follow.  When push comes to shove, a state who is equally as powerful as the Union will obviously not follow the laws that don't benefit it and lead to a crisis.

And of course the civil war, where states assumed the power to exit the Union.  A final trump card to be played when the will of the nation does not match their own.  I believe this is the most relevant to Europe as the cultures and languages are even more diverse.  In terms of government efficiency and economic growth, this diversity is a hindrance to overcome and not an asset.  In the long run diversity is good, but in the short run, it means that so many resources will be wasted trying to please varying contingents in Europe.  The only way to stop that nonsense and form  something real is to have a preeminent federal government to dictate terms to them and drag everyone kicking and screaming into a powerful and rich EU.

Catalonia is a good example of something that *might* be able to split out to be its own thing - significant independent thought and a suitable population at 7m make it a meaningful option.

The problem is just that everyone would constantly feel a little shafted by the arrangement - in some ways Catalonia would wield as much power as the rest of Spain (assuming both got the equivalent of national representation or 2 senators, whichever way you think of it). Of course it should be the weaker house that is seldom used, but still, I can see endless debate about such things.

true,SPRM,SCOT,German studying in Scotland,"I don't know exactly the reasons why Denmark chose to opt-out of the CSDP, but they did. They are part of NATO though, so a possible reason might be that they saw CSDP as not being complementary to NATO, but a rival and thus did not want to weaken the Atlantic alliance. A similar position is for example hold by the United Kingdom which sees NATO as the primary security organization in Europe and the CSDP only as a complementary addition; France, on the other hand, sees CSDP as a means to conduct security and defence operations independently from NATO, and thus the US. Other countries are somewhere in-between.

Now, I am unfortunately not familiar with Irish foreign policy, but as I said, they are taking part in various CSDP operations, see e.g. here:

&gt; Ireland contributes Defence Forces personnel to two of the three current EU missions. Ireland contributes seven personnel to the Operation ALTHEA mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ireland contributes seven personnel including the mission commander, Colonel Michael Beary, to EUTM Somalia, the EU’s mission to train Somali security forces in Uganda. The Government has this week approved the participation of a further three personnel to this mission.

Source: http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2012/03/14/00021.asp

Edit: To talk a little more about the required unanimity: a military operation of the EU is launched through a Council Joint Action, which means that basically all the foreign (and defence) ministers of all Member States have to agree to such an operation. This means that if Ireland, for example, had any stomach pains about a certain mission, it would be necessary to take into consideration their position and try to work out a solution that is agreeable for all of them. No country can be legally overruled here as would for example be the case in environmental policies or any other Council constellations that use a voting method with qualified majority. 

Such an agreement is usually not negotiated in the Foreign Affairs Council itself, but in the [Political and Security Committee (PSC)](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/foreign_and_security_policy/cfsp_and_esdp_implementation/r00005_en.htm) that consists of national delegates and the [Permanent Representatives Committee (Coreper)](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/coreper_en.htm) which is comprised of ambassadors of Member States to the EU.

&gt;Personally I think we shouldn't elect a president but a presdidential action plan or something like that. That way a president could be deposed if s/he doesn't follow his/her election promises.

This means such president should almost be undisturbed in the execution of such plan without influence of the European parliament and the like. Otherwise you get situations like in America where Obama wins with an action plan focused at more social healthcare and such but the opposition says lolnope. What should we do then? Depose him and vote a new one because he isn't able to fulfill his promises. Hell no.

The technology is there; many of the transactions already happen with plastic money. 

It does not even have to happen in one day, you can do it progressively. I.e. set something like a ""monthly cash withdrawal limit"" to a relatively low but adequate figure for small transactions, for example 20% of your salary. The rest will have to go through your digital wallet.

For that reason the legislature is run by people who's sole motivation is to bring funds and favorable condition to their district and their district alone. 

well, already the EU Parliament is in a better situation then - the electoral districts are larger, often the entire country. And ppl vote for parties for the most part, rather than individuals. Also, the election cycle is much longer.

Would be even better if transnational districts were introduced, so the fates of the ppl on those lists were not really tied to any particular area, and the mix on a list would need to have ppl from a decent % of the states.

&gt;So how do you solve this? Rules and institutions. The SEC, Budget Accountability Office, EPA, Department of Natural Resources etc. Run by educated people with the scope of the whole nation in mind. That is how you become efficient. That is how you grow your government to regulate for the good of the greatest amount of people. But these institutions are worth fuck all if they can not overrule state decisions.

Right, and states cannot overrule EU institutions either (though unanimity voting to even get many decisions is still too prevalent, but diminishing in scope w each new treaty). 

They don't have competencies to decide on various issues, but EU agencies reign in those, they cannot legislate on anything decided by EU laws (so called regulations) or they have some space in wording of an implementation of a directive (a fairly special system of decentralized lawmaking of the EU), subject to the verification by the constitutional court-equivalent on the EU level. And if they fail to implement these at all, the court implements the directive as worded in the EU parliament etc.

&gt; This means that for every law for the good of the EU, it will come with 50 public works projects or tax breaks riding along. 

... a prediction I see no basis in actuality for - EU budget is just around 1% of the total GDP, and this is mostly reserved for 'territorial cohesion' - ie development aid to the east and other poor regions, and agricultural subsidies system. 

And the budget is a balanced one, so no debt accumulation on the federal level is possible to allow for this. 

Indeed, the trajectory of the EU budget is more constrained than even the virtuous EU member states had.

Such a president could be the symbol of the direction that the people wants the union to take. The president should be able to submit parliamentary bills to referendums and to the national parliaments and other means of controll and ways of ""slowing down"" the political process whenever it runs contrary to popular will (checks and balance). The parliament could elect a prime minister that's forced to cooperate with the president, forcing a consensus-based political climate that I think is needed on a large-scale European level.

As for expenses and campaigning. I think it could be done like the Eurovision Song Contest.

Text: Wiedersehen mit Vater

Im Folgenden werde ich den Inhalt des Textes beschreiben. Der Text handelt von Thomas, welcher sich erinnert, dass er und seine Eltern ihre Ferien in CSSR verbrachten. Es ergab sich allerdings kurz darauf die Möglichkeit, dass sie in den Westen kommen konnten. Thomas Eltern unterhielten sich über diese Möglichkeit mit den anderen auf dem Campingplatz. Thomas verfolgte das Gespräch aufmerksam. Er erinnert sich nicht an das ganze Gespräch, aber er erinnert sich an das kribbelige Gefühl in seinem Bauch, weil er gern die schönen Sachen im Westen haben wollte. Der Vater wollte gern die Chance nutzen, aber Thomas Mutter war skeptisch. Auf Seite 8 Zeile 27 bis 29 steht es: Trotzdem beschlossen sie nach Prag zu fahren. Sie konnte nicht ihre Sachen mitnehmen. Sie gingen mit zwei Tasche und warteten vor dem Zaun. Plötzlich kletterten zwei Männer über den Zaun. Der Vater rief, dass sie über den Zaun klettern sollten. Aber die Mutter sagte, dass sie nicht wollte. Sie ging mit Thomas und wartete eine Stunde auf Thomas Vater. Thomas erinnert sich, dass er seine Mutter für sehr feige hielt. Danach wurden er und seine Mutter von der Staatsicherheit vernommen. Thomas Mutter hatte nicht mehr die Arbeit als Textilingenieur. Endlich kam die Wende – Thomas fieberte dem Tag, an dem er seinen Vater wiedersehen würde, entgegen. Aber erst nach drei Jahren meldete er sich per Telefon. Thomas Mutter wollte ihn nicht sehen. Thomas verstand warum. Aber jetzt wollte der Vater gern Thomas sehen. Thomas beschloss ihn zu treffen. Nach dem Treffen fragte Thomas seinen Vater, warum er sich nicht nach der Wende gemeldet hatte. Sein Vater erzählte ihm, dass er wütend war, und im ersten Monat es ihm nicht gut ging. Er war im Lager, arbeitslos und allein. Der Vater erzählte unter anderem, dass es immer schwerer wurde mit der Mutter und Thomas zu reden. Und er viele von der Welt gesehen hatte. Zum Schluss steht es: Auf Seite 12 Zeile 24 bis 26. Ich will diesen Abschnitt vorlesen.

Ich möchte jetzt den Text analysieren. Wir befinden uns in Deutschland vor und nach der Wende. Die zeit des Texts variiert. Der Anfang findet nach der Wende statt, danach erfahren wir was vor der Wende geschah und zum Schluss wird wieder von Ereignissen nach der Wende berichtet. Am Anfang wohnen Thomas und seine Eltern in der DDR. Die Ereignisse werden von einem personalen Erzähler wiedergegeben. Das Problem der Geschichte ist sowohl die Mauer zwischen West und Ost, als auch die psychische Mauer zwischen Thomas Mutter und Thomas Vater.

Nun werde ich die einzelnen Personen charakterisieren. In der Geschichte kommen drei Personen vor: Thomas und seine beiden Eltern. Thomas ist ein heranwachsender Junge. In der Schule halten ihn seine Freunde für einen Helden, weil sein Vater geflohen ist.

Thomas Mutter heißt Katja. Katja ist ein bisschen unsicher. Dies zeigt sich darin, dass sie erst nach Prag fährt, sich dann aber doch anders besinnt. Dennoch ist sie eine selbstbewusste Frau, weil sie sich entschieden weigert ihren Mann zu sehen.

Thomas Vater ist auch beharrlich. Er ist, wie seine Frau, ein bisschen egoistisch, weil er Thomas und Katja im Stich gelassen hat.

Der Text enthält viele Botschaften. Eine Botschaft ist, dass es verschiedene Mauer gibt. Die physischen und die psychischen Mauern. Obwohl die Mauer zwischen Ost und West weg ist – gibt es trotzdem eine Mauer. Die unsichtbare Mauer zwischen Thomas Eltern.

Der Text ist wichtig, weil wir alle diese unsichtbaren Mauern in unserem Leben haben. Ich persönlich denke, dass eine solche Mauer zwischen den Einwanderern und den Dänen besteht. Es handelt sich um eine Mauer aus Angst. Dies zeigt sich in den vielen Debatten über Einwanderer, wie zum Beispiel die Tuch Debatte.",0,1340211482,null,0,1340211792,0,c535puq,t3_vbl6e,t1_c535puq,t3_vbl6e,null,1429187551,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

If you want to stay in the center, i can speak for Hostal Josefina, in Gran Via street (http://www.hostal-josefina.com/es/estaticas/index.asp?wm=780&amp;id=250). I have used it several times for foreign students coming to events.

Another one we have tried is Hostal Centro in La Palma street, also in the center area but a bit more in the north. Their website sucks very bad (http://www.hostalcentromadridtribunal.es/hostal.swf), but it is also ok and cheap.

Which hotel to pick depends on whether you will want to sightsee around the center or not, and from where will you be taking the train/bus. The center has good metro connections to the airport and train/bus stations, that is why i suggest it.

Hope it helps, ask if you need anything else!

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; Everything else not listed 

Well, there's not much of importance left, is it?

There's the principle of *Rechtseinheit*, ""unity of law"", which says that laws should be the same in the whole of the federation. We don't have that 100% in Germany, because there *are* things that are up to the states, but I don't think that when you move to a new state here in Germany, you feel the need to inform yourself about the local laws. Even in areas where the states have the competence, there are *Rahmengesetze*, ""frame laws"", which are roughly comparable to EU directives. States are supposed to work together and agree on how to do things, and they can gang up on other states and transfer more powers to the federation if two thirds of them agree (plus two thirds of the parliament).

As boq already said, US states can levy their own taxes. In Germany, municipalities have the *Hebesatz*, i.e., they can set a local factor by which e.g., business taxes are multiplied, but they can't decide to levy their own taxes on top of federal ones like in the US, where states can have their own sales tax, gas tax, or even income tax.  
Just look at that shooting incident in Florida recently. It's up to the state to decide when it's OK to kill somebody. That goes a bit beyond of the competences states have in Germany.

&gt; Compared to the American president the German chancellor is very weak.

Yes, the chancellor is weak by design. Head of state and head of government are two separate offices, and can't be held in personal union. This has to be stated explicitly since you-know-who had the brilliant idea of taking the other job on the side. That the chancellor (or even the president) isn't elected directly, but by the parliament (respectively that weid construct that is the Federal Convention), has some pretty good reasons, and I think it's good that another can be elected at any time through a contructive vote of non-confidence.

Anyway, we have an entirely different situation in Europe, and a system similar to that in Germany is neither realistic not would it necessarily work that well. For example, electing a president directly might be a good idea. The focus of the European Parliament is on pretty technical matters, I don't think Europeans will follow it closely for quite some time, and mostly let their voting behavior be guided by whether or not they like the idea of a federal Europe at all, or just vote for the parties they would vote for on a national level even though the reasons for doing so wouldn't be issues that are even relevant on the Eu level. We'll probably see relatively dynamic majorities, where social democrats from one country vote with conservatives from another on one issue, but not on another, and that's not ideal if the parliament would have to find majorities to form a government. It should have to confirm it, though, and have the power to recall it.

There is an element of truth in this.

How will be get each and every country to agree on one common law about transparency?

The process is a farce.

The European Union already is a federative supranational union of states in many areas. The way in which the national governments and the European government work together has all the characteristics of a federation. The Union is competent to harmonize legislation in a great number of legal areas in a supranational way (by majority voting in Council and Parliament) and in a number of sensitive areas it can still take certain measures by way of consensus. These sensitive areas include common foreign and security policy, and something else which I forget right now. Matters which are considered taboo are those traditionally considered to form the core of state sovereignty, such as immigration, fiscal policy and defense policy.

The thing is that currently a lot of subjects that can now be harmonized by majority voting were at some point or another in the past considered to be taboo, matters concerning which only a sovereign state could pass legislation on. Slowly, but surely the Union has appropriated many of those areas of legislation, such as national health, environmental protection and for Eurozone countries even monetary policy. 

The point I wanted to get across in this post is that the Union already has a full tool kit to deal with the current contingency. Through the EFSF and ESM, or perhaps through some other form of enhanced cooperation - which is already provided for in the treaties. The creation of a nation state would be a powerful symbolic act with deep implications for the national consciousnesses of the constituent states. 

The power of the European Union that we live in today is already unsettling to many, and its current incarnation is one that has evolved, grown organically from its humble beginnings as a European Community for Coals and Steel - even if its growth has been hurried along every now and again with the injection of some hard-core political steroids. 

Considering that the Lisbon treaty was originally meant to be called 'Constitution for Europe', and that it failed *because* of the implication of statehood that it carried, I'd say that this intended federalization of our continent may just be a bit brash.",0,1340220696,null,0,false,0,c538bkb,t3_vbrkg,t1_c538bkb,t3_vbrkg,null,1429188783,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

&gt;So the way it is at the moment (or, rather, from 2014 onwards) is that the European Parliament will elect somebody to be the Commission President. The Commission President then appoints his or her Commissioners who then have to be approved en-bloc by the European Parliament.
What I'm suggesting is that the European Parliament would have to elect an MEP to be Commission President, and the rest would be the same.

It is not in the interest of European politicians and the bureaucracy. Sad but true.
