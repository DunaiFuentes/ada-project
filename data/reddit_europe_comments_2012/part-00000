Also, Northern dialects are quite fragmented and also the farthest from Italian than in the centre and south of Italy, and somewhat closer to French or Spanish.

But for example in Venice it's common to speak the regional language, or a heavily regionalized version of Italian.  In Rome or Florence people often use a dialect of standard Italian (completely intelligible in Florence, requiring some practice for a foreigner in Rome).  Cross the border from Como to Switzerland, and you'll hear a bit more dialect but not much; 30 kms more and you'll suddenly hear the same dialect spoken by young people.

Both claims are true, but

2) The yield-base rate difference is smaller, but a 7% base rate is a burden on economic growth as credit becomes too expensive.

First of all, Tenerife has el Teide, which is the largest mountain peak in Spain and also a volcano and on UNESCO's World Heritage List. This huge mountain splits the island in two, so to speak, with the northern half wetter and greener than the southern half. If you just want sunshine and beaches you should go to the southern half and stay in [Playa del Duque](http://www.google.es/search?q=tenerife+Playa+del+Duque&amp;hl=es&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2rMAT4zFEsTOhAeF1PGuAQ&amp;ved=0CFkQsAQ&amp;biw=1333&amp;bih=740) or Playa Fañabé (avoid nearby Las Americas as it is a pretty tacky area filled with fat, drunk English hooligans). 

Rent a car and go up the mountain to do some hiking in the woods or go all the way to the top to see the volcanic moonscape near the peak. You can even spend the night in the Hotel Parador. 

If you stay on the Northern side of the islands, the towns and the landscape is much prettier, but not as sunny. Puerto de La Cruz is the big city in that area and dominated by older German pensioners who keep the town quite tidy and attractive. The beaches in the north are wilder (rocky and black sand as opposed to the grayish or yellow sand you'll find in the south) with stronger currents. There are two medium sized cities (150,000-250,000 pop) La Laguna and Santa Cruz which are both worth checking out, but depending on where you stay, maybe not worth the drive.

On the mainland, stay in Madrid to maximize your time and maybe visit Toledo. Madrid has a ton of great food and some of the best nightlife in Europe, so it should keep you busy for a couple of days.

[Iranian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution#Causes)
&gt;During World War II the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union invaded Iran to gain access to the nation's infrastructure and restrict ties to Germany. The Shah, Iran's monarch, was forced to abdicate in favor of his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. During this time Iran was a constitutional monarchy with a strong prime minister. **In the early 1950s the new prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, nationalized the country's petroleum industry. The move angered the British and U.S. governments which, in 1953, engineered a coup d'état that deposed Mosaddegh and established the Shah, 
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, as a de facto autocrat, sympathetic to the U.S. and U.K.**[20]

&gt;**Iran Air Flight 655 was a civilian jet airliner shot down by U.S. missiles** on July 3, 1988, over the Strait of Hormuz, toward the end of the Iran–Iraq War. The aircraft, an Airbus A300B2-203 operated by Iran Air, was flying from Bandar Abbas, Iran, to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, over Iran's territorial waters in the Persian Gulf on its usual flight path when it was destroyed by the United States Navy guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes (CG-49), killing all 290 passengers and crew aboard,[1] ranking it twelfth among the deadliest disasters in aviation history. **It was the highest death toll of any aviation incident in the Indian Ocean** and the highest death toll of any incident involving an Airbus A300 anywhere in the world. Vincennes entered into Iranian territorial waters after sending one of its helicopters to buzz Iranian speedboats located inside Iranian waters, and the helicopter drew warning fire from the speedboats. **IR655 was within Iranian airspace at the time it was shot down**.

&gt;NEW YORK, Dec. 23, 2011 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- A federal district court in Manhattan yesterday entered a historic ruling that reveals new facts about Iran's support of al Qaeda in the 9/11 attacks.  U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels ruled yesterday that Iran and Hezbollah materially and directly supported al Qaeda in the September 11, 2001 attacks and are legally responsible for damages to hundreds of family members of 9/11 victims who are plaintiffs in the case.

Southern Europe would have just devalued a bit, or a lot, like always.

The Germans would have had a bit more inflation, then the Germans would have raised their own interest rates, to avoid more inflation, which would have given Southern Europe a breathing space rather than the garrote they have now.

Ten years post the inception of the euro we face this European götterdämmerung, which we did not face ten years pre the euro.

true,belgianguy,BELG,Belgium," War is not in our best interest, attacking Iran would cancel out all the pro-Western support that lives in many layers of its society. Anyone remember the [protests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009%E2%80%932010_Iranian_election_protests) that took place there? If a single bullet is fired on an Iranian citizen by the US or other coalition troops, those that were looking up to us will gladly burn every US/coalition flag and embassy (if Bachmann is to be believed) they can find and we instantly become enemy #1.


Iran doesn't want a war either, as they know they'll always lose more than what they could ever win. With other opponents like a US-backed Israel and long time enemy Saudi Arabia, they'd be reduced to smouldering bits and pieces in a moment if they want to pick a fight with the US. As a wealthy nation with a decent standard of living, it has far more to lose entering a war than a country that already is in shambles. So while they have been posturing lately as being willing to fight a war, they really aren't. It's theater to show they are defiant w.r.t. the newly imposed sanctions, but my bet is they'll simmer down and come sit at the negotiations table pretty soon.

One of the main fault lines that can be seen lately is that Russia and China seem to band together far more often and state so publicly. While one should not forget about its own identity, I believe it's in Europe's and the US's best interest to find a common ground on which they can band together. I for one, don't think that highly of Russia's and China's obstructionist behavior when it comes to Syria for example. Plus democracy isn't exactly something both countries shine in. Therefor it would also be foolish of the US to start a war singlehandedly, because ""We don't need to ask what or who we want to bomb!"" doesn't exactly garner a lot of support, which could then force Europe's hand to denounce a US rambo-like approach.",0,1325457602,null,0,true,0,c3d1wna,t3_nyanc,t1_c3d1wna,t3_nyanc,null,1428108405,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I use congstar for its €20 plan, which has unlimited sms, a data plan and some voice and it uses the Telekom network.


2. Why can't you sign up for internet? Surely you could get something? [Edit: I suppose 4 months is a bit short, you could try paying a neighbor for wifi access.] I think most companies are ok with tethering, but you could also look into one of the ubiquitous ""Surf-Sticks"" that everyone offers.


3. My guess is that you're going to find it difficult to formally learn dialectical German. (""Alemannic German"" also isn't one dialect.) It would probably be best to just continuing to learn Hochdeutsch as it is universally taught and you can pick up the regional differences as you go along.


4. You'll be fine. The biggest issue you'll find is that some people will be reluctant to use their English even though its really fine. Of course Lörrach will not be a hot bed of English like other larger centers, but in a pinch I'd bet that most people will know enough to answer simple questions in English. And almost anyone under 35 is conversant I find.


5. Everyone is going to have a different response to that, but I find starting in German is best. A good way is to start and appologize for your poor German, the usual response is ""no, your German is good!"" even though it's a load of bollocks. Most conventions transfer over, but obviously use the Sie form if you're attempting German. Shaking hand is definitely the norm in Germany. Others can answer about workplace norms as I've never worked in Germany.


6. There's isn't an equivalent in Germany to Tim Hortons, unless you want to consider McCafe an attempt that that. People generally get their coffee from their local cafe. Ordering a double double will get you no where. Here's a [discussion](http://www.toytowngermany.com/lofi/index.php/t194755.html) of ordering coffee in German.


7. Opening a bank account requires two things: your passport and your completed Anmeldung form from the local Bürgeramt. You can probably find a bank that will explain it in English. For transfers I would recommend [XE Trade](http://www.xe.com/fx/). It's what most expats use to move money around. I use it to tranfer money from my Canadian bank to my German.


8. Bahn.de is by far the best rail site in Europe. Though you can't buy tickets for foreign trips it has an amazing time table Europe wide. There are other websites but it would depend on what you want to do. 
Yes, transfers are easy. You won't be showing your ticket to anyone as you get on board (unless it's a sleeper car). The conductor will come through the train to check tickets after you've left.
Most tickets are valid from your location to location within a time period (I think a month from purchase), rather than a specific timed train. So if you missed your train you can simply get on the next one. The exception here would be if you had seat reservations.
You can always check the Bahn website, they list specials there. Normally I'd recommend looking into a BahnCard but if you're only there for 4 months it probably wouldn't pay for itself.",0,1325499965,null,0,true,0,c3d7ia0,t3_nzk9i,t1_c3d7ia0,t3_nzk9i,null,1428111120,10,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,10

1+2: No idea really, not tech-savvy

3: The best way to learn the dialect (which most people will be speaking) is by actively imitating it from your coworkers. It may sound mocking to them, just explain quickly that it's the best way to learn a language. As far as I know there is no programme to learn the dialect, as most people want to improve their speech to high german, not the other way around.

4: Younger people and middle-class older people are likely to speak English. You can easily ask people on the street, young adults are your best bet for getting people who can give good directions in English. 

5: Idk how good your German is, but I'd suggest asking: ""Entschuldigen Sie bitte"" for questions, ""Guten Tag"" for formal greetings/boss/first time meeting coworkers, ""Hallo"" or ""Hi"" for coworkers the following times. They will quickly pick up your accent and falsely assume you for being from the USA ;) Many Germans will be eager to try their horrible English on you. (No, the irony does not escape me. My English sucks.)

Unlike most English-speaking countries, Germans do not have an 'empty phrase' at the beginning of conversations, like: ""How do you do/How are you/How are you doing"" to which there is no answer expected. If someone asks you ""Wie geht's?/Na, wie geht's?"", a short answer of ""Gut, und dir (informal)/Ihnen (formal)?"" is likely expected. With friends/friendly colleagues, you are expected to answer truthfully if you are in fact feeling bad. 
""Und, wie geht's?"" during work-hours is likely to mean: 'How are you doing workwise, any problems?'

Use formal 'Sie' whenever you are talking to higher-ups like your boss, and colleagues when you meet them. They will offer you to use ""Du"" soon enough. 
If you are in a situation in which you aren't sure, use ""Sie,"" coming from an English-speaker it's never taken to be bad.

6: After googling what you were talking about: there might be a regional coffee-chain there, idk, but universally there are loads of bakeries in Germany and 95% of them sell you a cup of coffee, sugar and milk are mostly self-service. Best tactic would be to ask one or all of your coworkers to accompany you for a coffee.

7: If you want to pay mostly in cash, look for the most ideal cashpoint and choose that bank.  Generally, I'd recommend going to a larger bank like Sparkasse, all bank-tellers will help you in English. As long as you have a residence and a passport there shouldn't be a problem. Credit card are rarely used in Germany, EC-cards are commonly used for big purchases.

8: Bahn.de will give you the best infos. Transfers are easy, look for signs or ask personnel if you're confused. Tickets are checked during the train-ride if its a costly ride, otherwise seldom. There won't be last minute offers, it's more the other way round: If you know a long time in advance when you want to ride the train, there are special offers. http://www.bahn.de/p/view/angebot/berater.shtml?dbkanal_020=1&amp;dbkanal_007=L01_S01_D001_KIN0014_top-navi-berater_LZ01

Here in the Netherlands we've seen a small hit in prices but a strong consumer response. For instance a beer used to cost ~2,50 guilders (exchange rate ƒ2,20371 = €1) and suddenly cost €2,50 so people just stayed at home and got drunk there in stead (a fact that hotel- and bar owner quickly and falsely attributed to the smoking ban). Eventually prices in cafe's lowered (though still higher than before, a greater increase than inflation can account for).

The consensus here is that rather than the 2.20371 to 1 conversion rate we should have gotten 2 : 1, the blame in on the Germans who got a great deal at 2DM per euro while our Guilder was coupled to the Mark, effectively Dutch people lost ~10% of their money. On the other hand the price for a beer hasn't gone up since years now so slowly but surely things are returning to normal. I think what we're seeing now is the first evidence of re-equilibration after the markets were perturbed by the introduction of the euro a decade ago.

2) Tethering is not really an option. Consider a 'surf stick'.

3) Alemannic German is spoken by some ten thousand people in this area. As posted before, it is neither easy to learn nor useful to know. I don't think there are any textbooks or Alemannic/English dictionaries. Everyone you will meet will be able to communicate in Standard High German.

4) Everybody below the age of 60 knows at least basic English, so no problem here. Nobody will point you to the wrong direction if they don't know the place you're asking for; they will just tell you to ask someone else.

5) In Germany, it's hard to start a conversation in an insulting way. The best way to break the ice is 'Ihre Papiere, bitte!' or 'Wo waren Sie zwischen 1939 und 1945?'

6) Good donuts and bagels are hard to find in Germany. Coffee and sandwiches are normally offered in bakeries.

7) To set up a bank account, you need a residential address, your passport and - most importantly - and appointment. The type of bank account you're looking for is called 'Girokonto' and comes with a debit card. Make sure you check the option for online banking on the form.

8) I don't know about Switzerland, but virtually every train connection in Germany is best booked via bahn.de. Cheap tickets ('Sparpreis') are available if you buy your tickets several weeks ahead. The conductor will ask for your ticket and stamp it, then return it to you. If you miss a train because of a delay, just take the next one. Tickets for local trains are often valid for two days so you're not required to take a certain train.

That creates a shortage of euros in that country. So the local central bank prints the extra money. But in the surplus countries, the net exporters, there is an excess of euros, so the central bank there reduce the flow of money they create. There is no overall change in amount of euros in circulation and hence no inflationary impact. The transfers do not show up on the accounts of the ECB.

Are you serious?  The euro used to be ~1.5 times stronger. That's the only reason why the UK and US prices went down.

_EDIT_: when/what, as pointed out correctly. 

* usd vs. eur was 0.9 on Jan 1 2002, 1.4 on Jan 1 2012.

* gbp vs. eur was 0.6 on Jan 1 2002, 0.83 on Jan 1 2012.

That the euro is no longer overvalued, and the usd/gbp are no longer undervalued is the reason why the euro's purchasing power went down, and the usd/gbp purchasing power went up.  Notice how the US/UK price oscillations are very consistent with the currency ratios (e.g. usd vs. eur was 1.25 on Jan 1 1997, plummeted up to 2002, and then went up again).  The same effect can be observed on Switzerland (huge increase in the last two years, when the franc went from 1.5-1.6 CHF for a euro up to 1.2 CHF for a euro).

Everything else stayed within government-reported inflation, in my experience.  One interesting observation, and one of the few things that Berlusconi ever said and I agree with, is the following.  In the first few years after the introduction of the euro, people tended to compare euro prices with lira prices, but they did so with a ratio of 1 Euro = 2000 lire.  This introduces an extra ""perceived"" inflation of 3%, and (together with the few cases in which business owners acted dishonestly and ""rounded"" prices up) gave a bad name to the euro.

Another observation is that previously prices were ""rounded"" to 50 lire, 100 lire, 500 lire, or 1000 lire (depending on the kind of good and kind of business); now they are usually rounded to 5 cents, 10 cents, 50 cents, 1 euro respectively.

What I would say is that according to the euro stat data, ""price levels of final consumption by private households"" in the UK have decreased from 114 in 2007, to 100 in 2010.

During that time the euro appreciated against the pound c. 30%

Over the next 3 - 4 years one would expect the euro to give up those 30% gains.  It's already given up c. 13%  of the 30%  contra the pound  since the turn point at the beginning of 2009.

So one would expect UK price levels to move towards the US number, in the Euro stat table of c. 90 and then some, while the rest of the eurozone chases after the Spanish numbers as the value of the euro declines against the dollar and commodity prices, over which the euro is likely to have a declining influence.

true,PredictionBoom,null,null,"There are many good answers here already, but here are some things i'd like to add:

2) Tethering will work, but most carriers will charge extra for it. Be careful though: Right now, mobile data speeds aren't anywhere near Canadian/Northamerican 4G speeds. Many carriers also cap your maximum speed to EDGE after 1 or 2 gigs per month, so make sure you read the small print. The main carriers are slowly rolling out experimental LTE networks at the moment, but only in the biggest german cities.

So tethering can be a bit of a pain in the ass. Someone else mentioned ""Alice DSL"", they offer a contract-free line, but the paperwork can be a bit annoying, and their support is atrocious. If i were you, i'd simply ask around the neighbours if someone is willing to share their home wifi with you in exchange for a few bucks. If you don't want to go from door to door, maybe you can put a note in the staircase? Just explain your situation, there's a good chance someone is willing to help you. I know a lot of exchange students who have or had some kind of deal with their neighbours.

3) Just stick to high german! Alemannic will be hard to understand at first, let alone to learn. I'm swabian myself, and i mostly speak high german now since i moved away. But every now and then i fall back into my dialect and i'm immediatly made fun of. I worked at a few big companies, and high german always was the norm. German dialects simply are a local quirk and not necessary at all.

4) Most young people speak English just fine, don't worry. English is taught in all german schools, and it has been compulsory for a few decades now. A friend of mine is a Californian who moved to Berlin, and his biggest problem when learning German was that every German he met wanted to practice English. He actually had to force his friends to speak German with him, maybe you have to do the same. Of course you can always ask for directions, and to be honest, i don't think you are going to get lost and starve to death in Lörrach. It's not *that* big...

5) Start in german, and if you get stuck, most people will switch to english automatically. At work, make sure you use the ""Sie"" form first, especially among superiors. Using the ""Du"" when talking to your boss is often seen as an insult and as a lack of respect. Most colleagues on your level will offer you the less formal ""Du"" very quickly, however. The company i work at has a ""Du""-only policy, only the CEO is referred to as ""Sie"".

But don't agonize about that too much - Germans know that their grammar is difficult and hard to learn. People will pick up your accent and i doubt anyone will give you a hard time if you mess up.

6) Yes, we love beer, but most people at my office don't start their day with a gallon of lager (there have been exceptions). Germans are obsessed with bread (they really are) and german towns are full of bakeries, from small family-owned shops to huge chains. That's where people get their breakfast. When Starbucks started to invade Europe about a decade ago, the bakeries adapted. Decent coffee to go is pretty much standard now. You won't have problems getting your fix ""mit Milch und Zucker"", just pick a bakery you like. 

8.) Stick to Bahn.de, it's the site of the (formerly state-owned) German Railways company (DB). They offer tickets for all connections, including privately operated third-party trains. There are also multi-language DB ticket machines in all railway stations. To transfer, just hop into your next train. Tickets are valid for the whole day, if you miss a train, just use the next one.

Superior Maritime Services was contracted in January to transport 10 containers of munitions, including 195 smart Blu-110 bombs and 192 huge 2,000 pound Blu-117 bombs, which are designed for use against hardened or underground structures.

[Strait of Hormuz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Hormuz#Iranian_threats)
&gt;On June 29, 2008, the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, Ali Mohammed Jafari, said that if Iran were attacked by Israel or the United States, it would seal off the Strait of Hormuz, to wreak havoc in oil markets. This statement followed other more ambiguous threats from Iran's oil minister and other government officials that a Western attack on Iran would result in turmoil in oil supply.

Lanzarote is perhaps the most beautiful island, with a nice variety of beaches, but you'd have to fly there and it has zero night life (the island just goes to bed around sunset, it's eerie) and no mountains.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"Actually I do believe it, and let me open up for you on why I believe so. Even if we wouldn't have had Euro there would have been number of things that would stayed the same even if there would have been no Euro. For example lets look at the situation in GIPS countries, do note that not everything applies to everywhere...

**Extra-European circumstances.** 

* Both Japan and the USA would have flooded global markets with cheap money offered by their respective central banks.
* Rise of the Chinese manufacturing would have eroded competitiveness of traditional southern European industries.
* Increasing oil, gas and commodity prices would have hurt southern economies more than northern, which are more energy efficient.

**Cultures, values and beliefs of societies.**

* Countries would still have had divisional politics, largely thanks to the haunting memories of their not so distant dictatorships.
* There would exist strong mistrust against state leading to the same kind of corruption and mishandling of public money as we have seen so far.
* Markets wouldn't be anymore free as they are now, simply because A) public sector is too large and powerful; and B) there is no trust or understanding in the general populations / political class that free market economy is the best way to manage the functioning of the economy.

So what would have happened...

GIPS countries would have experienced strong real estate boom fueled by having both local banks and companies cheap USd or Yen denominated loans from the markets, and by having flood of foreign direct investments to their real estate markets. This would have largely masked eroding of traditional industries and allowed states with their added surplus increase their expenditure. Financial trickery would also have been used to further increase growth. No structural changes would have been made as there simply wouldn't have been any need for it, the only thing that would have been different that in the EU there would have been more lobbying to protect local industries, but it is questionable it that would have helped.

When the collapse of financial bubble would have began in 2008, GIPS countries would have very quickly been exposed to the turmoils of financial markets. Cheap money that flooded their economies would ceased quickly to exist, causing collapse of construction and other industries tied to the boom. If GIPS countries would try to fix the situation by allowing their currencies to devalue, they would cause massive wave of bankruptcies of individuals, companies and banks due to foreign loans. Other way to fix the situation would be to make an internal devaluation and increase interest rates to keep foreign reserves up, but that would cause huge political protests and again would lead to some individuals, companies and banks going bankrupt. Not to mention that there would be huge amounts of speculation in currency markets, forcing states to make decisions quick or face a possibility of a bank run and collapse of their economy.

The current crisis without the Euro would the same as in the beginning of 90s.

1.  Regarding educational inflation - a degree nowadays is considered useless on its own - that I am comfortable to say is pretty much accepted across the developed world.  The trouble with that is that this is a new concept, born and brought about in the last 2 decades.  

Does this mean now everyone has to chase down a Masters or PhD?  If that's the case then we will have gotten nowhere - once everyone get's their PhD we will be stuck at the same level as now when everyone gets their Bachelor's.  

I do agree with you that access to education has become very easy - but not sure what you mean by everyone nowadays can get a diploma.  

I don't think the right solution is to get everyone to be digging ditches or working at flipping burgers - but I agree with the spirit of your comment.

What is lacking in the western world is a lack of entrepreneurial spirit.  People are unemployed because no one wants to hire them.  In my grandparents day (1930s-50s Denmark) - they had to make due by being their own boss.  

Start your own business - go through the effort of baking that bread yourself, writing that book, create that investment company.  Big companies don't want to give you anything with just education.  They want experience as well.  

People are afraid of the risk with starting your own business - afraid of being squashed by giant corporations or losing money.  What more do you need to lose if you haven't found income in years?

The number of students failing to achieve the minimum credits to receive student benefit has risen 40% following the implementation of the Process.

This indicates that it has become *more difficult* for students to finish their education on time than it was before.

En fait, le souci n'est pas tant que les Etats payent cher, mais plutôt qu'en situation de crise extrême, la Fed a pris des libertés assez étonnantes. 

En particulier, le fameux taux de 0,01% est suite à une opération de financement de 20 milliards, dans le cadre d'une opération un peu plus grosse de 80 milliards connue sous le doux nom de _ST OMO_ (single-tranche open market operation), qui a servi surtout à donner une bouée de sauvetage à 3 grosses banques européennes pour éviter une crise systémique.

Et le montant de 1000 milliards est effectivement surprenant, mais il fait référence là encore à des facilités de crédit très largement au-delà de ce qui était attendu de la Fed (et qu'elle s'est bien gardée de communiquer publiquement sur le coup, d'ailleurs si toutes les banques avaient été au max de leurs emprunts possibles, ça serait monté à 6800 milliards de dollars.). 

Bref, ce qui est choquant, ce n'est pas tant que les Etats ne puissent pas s'auto-financer, puisque c'est un choix politique qui date de Maastricht et qui est un point non négociable avec Merkel.

He's just being direct, dishing out the cold, hard truth. Incidentally, [cultural differences](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13545386) are among the things languages teachers in particular should be aware of.

To expand on GP's comment, and sticking with the frank style to aid your cultural adjustment explicitly without the intend to offend: There are English teachers, who may or may not have grown up speaking English natively, and there are native speakers ""teaching English"" as tutors. I'm sorry to say the latter most certainly does not qualify as a ""solid plan"".

You have to be aware that teaching languages is not something you just pick up as you go, or a skill that you can train for by taking one of the many short courses that will give you some kind of certification they made up. I'm not saying the training they provide is entirely worthless, but keep in mind that especially Irish youth unemployment is, as you would say in English, ""elevated"", and that their problems would be solved if you could make a decent living based on your native language skills and a short course.  
Professional English teachers, on the other hand, typically study English with a focus on teaching, and specialize on things like ""professional English"", (e.g., ""business English"", ""English for medical professionals"", etc.) or the two distinct specializations of ""English as a second language"" (teaching immigrant kids that grow up in an English speaking country but don't speak it at home) or ""English as a foreign language"" (which is what you want to do). As it turns out, there is a huge body of research on how people acquire a new language, how this differs for kids and adults, how to assess their abilities, correct their mistakes, and how to teach them most effectively either one-on-one or in a classroom environment. At least in Germany, ""English as a foreign language"" is broken down further into *separate* university programs, depending on what kind of school you intend to teach in. There is much more to teaching languages than merely knowing all the grammar rules. Those quick courses are to a proper English teaching degree as reading ""Sophie's World"" is to your philosophy course. Institutions such as public schools would reject your application because you simply don't meet the requirements.

That said, you *can* work as an English tutor on the side, to make ends meet while you attend university in one of the countries you mentioned, and you can even find programs that teach ""English as a foreign language"" at (zero tuition fee) public universities in several of the countries you mentioned.

Catch an S-Bahn to the Hauptwache (costs about €3.xx and probably from platform 1 of the Regional Bahnhof. It will take about 10-15mins mins to the centre of town. When you exit, you check for times back to the airport (other side of platform where you get off). If you are traveling long-haul aim to be back at the airport at least 90 mins before departure (security queues are light at that time) if you depart from Terminal 1, and add about 20 mins from terminal 2. For short-haul an hour is fine for T1.

If you are running late, Frankfurt implements a ""Fast Lane"" at security. If your flight is on the list shown at security then you get to bypass even the business queue.

As for what to do, well it is a Sunday which means shopping is out. However the museums are open. I would suggest hitting the museums and then grabbing dinner and that should fill your time until 20:00 or so when you want to be heading back.

Secondo la mia personalissima opinione ricalca una delle immagini che sembrano tanto piacere a certi elettori italiani, ossia quella del giovane imprenditore in gamba ma che può benissimo essere l'amico che trovi al bar e di cui parli di un pò di tutto (calcio, donne, macchine, ...). Da questo punto di vista, piuttosto simile al Berlusca (tranne la giovane età :-). Gli piace fare il politico piacione/simpatico/poco serioso/cool: anche se in certi casi meno seriosità può non fare male, io da un politico mi aspetto un certo contegno. Sarò all'antica, ma il degrado recente nella classe politica mi fa davvero schifo. Inoltre, ha un'aria da furbetto abbastanza odiosa: per intenderci, non so se sarei mai amico di una persona così...

Però in certe occasioni non mi sono trovato in disaccordo con lui e, comunque, una scossa sta provando a darla: secondo me ce n'è bisogno, a 360 gradi. Siamo un paese davvero statico, basato su una caterva di privilegi che ognuno si tiene bene stretti, fregandosene abbondantemente degli altri. Io sono stufo di questa situazione. Se vogliamo davvero risollevarci, bisogna cambiare. Cosa centra Renzi in tutto ciò? Per me è una voce critica/dissonante, che se non altro porta pareri diversi e offre opportunità di riflessione e crescita. Dal punto di vista della persona, mi ripeto, non lo adoro, ma sto davvero aspettando qualcuno che porti dei cambiamenti....

La différence vient dans le contrôle que l'on peut avoir sur les dites institutions qui est impossible et inexistant sur les banques privées

C'est une fraude de laisser croire que l'on ne fait marcher la planche à billets alors que les banques prêtent de l'argent qu'elles n'ont pas (pour les occidentales en tt cas), tout les prêts sont des paris actuellement. Donc que la banque centrale finance directement ou qu'elle passe par la banque privée, si les conditions de ""prêt/destruction"" sont réunies l'inflation reste(ra) maîtrisée (?). 

Le problème est que l'intermédiaire est transnational, use des fonds à discrétion, n'est presque pas contrôlé par le bailleur (la BCE) et se sert principalement de cette ressources non pour effectivement financer l'économie ou les Etats mais pour alimenter les jeux boursiers les plus vils (je ne fais ici pas référence au mécanisme d'investissement que consiste l'achat d'actions, simplement aux produits ""dérivés"" et spéculatifs et les matières premières) et éponger leurs propres pertes.

&gt;Fidesz politicians are pretty well forbidden to say anything. By now the slip-ups of Mihály Varga and László Mádi have resulted in a total blackout of news about Fidesz's plans for the future.   

It's a bit surprising that voters weren't alarmed enough by this that they would flock to the polling stations to prevent them from getting men elected to parliament.  Let alone win 2/3 of the votes.

true,yannickmahe,FRAN,France,"My country having been in the EU since before I was born, I can't really say how it would be without it.

Here are a few benefits I have seen though.

* I'm French, but a part of my family is Italian. Before Italy implemented the Schengen treaty, crossing the border would be something of a hassle. We were once prevented from going into Italy because my brother, an infant then, had not been added to my parent's passports. Today, we just go there, no one is ever at the border post.

* Being in the EU help tremendously for studying abroad. At my university third of my class spent at least 1 year abroad. And this help is not just for going to EU countries. Friends of mine, on EU programs, went to American universities, internships in Japan, and I myself studied for a year in China.

* Regarding human rights, the European court of Justice and the European Court for human rights have been a godsend IMO. France had very shoddy rights for the defense in criminal investigations, which the ECHR condemned as going against the European Declaration for Human Rights (this may already apply to Croatia as it is a member of the council of Europe).

* Regarding the economy, I feel the EU and the Euro have helped, as my country makes a lot of money on tourism, and the loss of borders and the common currency have made it easier for tourists to come. Given the attractiveness of Croatia to tourists, it would certainly help.

* If you want to travel outside of the EU: if the country you go to doesn't have a Croatian embassy or consulate, if Croatia joins the EU you could go to the embassy of any EU country and receive the same help you would get from your embassy: financial help, judicial assistance etc.

* Finally, the biggest benefit IMO, is that if I ever want to live and work in an other EU country, I can just find a job and go there. I love living abroad, but the hassle of getting visas in China was unbearable.

My biggest gripe is that the very slow political process of the EU is quite annoying, especially when decisions need to be made fast

Upsides:

- You can just get your ID card and move anywhere through Europe without hassle.

- You can study abroad and enjoy the same rights as national students. I'm not 
talking about erasmus, I'm talking about doing the entire college abroad. I for instance studied medicine in Barcelona.

- You can work abroad, and enjoy the same rights as national workers and it is stupidly easy to manage.

- You can ""enjoy"" the Euro if you had a weak currency.

- Much of the lawmaking process gets shifted to brussels, this as some advantages as: Less local lobbing; the elected f* have to answer to someone; some goddam economic responsibility embodied even if it means harsh policies.

- New countries generally enjoy a period of great development after entering the EU, especially regarding infrastructure.


Downsides:

- You can ""enjoy"" the Euro. (Meaning you don't have the means to devalue currency thus easily paying debt + inflaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaation)

- Much of the lawmaking process gets shifted to brussels - So much that at a given moment you start to realise that the elections that really matter are the ones with washed out politicians and that you don't care about. Besides Brussels is so far away that it kind of becomes an abstraction.
