&gt;His marriage (29 June 1960 - 18 March 1987) to Pierrette Lalanne resulted in three daughters; these daughters have given him nine granddaughters. The break-up of the marriage was somewhat dramatic, with his ex-wife posing nude in the French edition of Playboy to ridicule him.[4] Marie-Caroline, another of his daughters, would also break with Le Pen, following her husband to join Bruno Mégret, who split from the FN to found MNR, the rival Mouvement National Républicain (National Republican Movement).[4] The youngest of Le Pen's daughters, Marine Le Pen, is leader of the Front National.

La plus jeune de ses filles, Marine Le Pen, lui a succedé à la présidence du Front national en 2011.

With due respect, before we go any further, I'm glad you seem to be acknowledging that the very ""supposed requirement"" for the media to provide balanced information, whose existence you angrily denied in your previous post, does indeed exist. So I'm glad we cleared that up.

&gt;the media authority cannot start an investigation into some balanced reporting by its own. There has to be someone, who has to request, and on whose behalf the investigation is done.

True. In fact, ""any viewer or listener"" can tell the Media Authority that she/he believes media coverage was not ""balanced"". The Media Authority can take on any such complaint and make its own assessment whether the coverage was balanced - and if they find it is not, they can order the media outlet to broadcast its decision in the manner it wants. All of this can be done without any judicial intervention.

&gt;Before this law, anyone with objection on media reporting could go to the court directly (as it happened multiple times) and request that a correction be published, that anyone can do even now. [..] So why is this new procedure worse than the one before?

You are talking about the possibility to sue for a correction of false or slanderous information, I'm guessing? But the Media Authority now has the ability to act against media outlets for any content deemed not to be ""objective"" or ""balanced"". That goes a lot further than what the usual judicial options provide for.

&gt;Then, a bit further in the law, there is a provision, that any party can request from a court that the decision of the media authority be overruled.

The judicial review process envisaged in the Media Act is in fact one of the points of criticism that have been leveled at the law. As [this recent study](https://cmcs.ceu.hu/sites/default/files/field_attachment/news/node-27293/Hungarian_Media_Laws_in_Europe_0.pdf) summarizes:

&gt;[T]he process of appeals regarding the Media Authority’s decisions appears to be inconsistent with the legal framework for appeals in [other European countries]. In Hungary, media outlets may appeal the Media Authority’s sanctioning decisions in an administrative court. Appeals do not automatically suspend the Authority’s decisions. In addition, the administrative court may only review whether the Authority’s decision complies with the provisions in the media laws but the court cannot consider the Authority’s decisions on the basis of any other laws or legal precedents. Decisions of the administrative court cannot be further appealed.

All of this, the study concluded, is in variance even with the very practices in other European countries which the Hungarian government has pointed to as precedents. And remember: this doesn't just hold for the relatively minor sanction for unbalanced coverage. It also holds for the massive fines the Authority can impose for infringements of such hazy provisions as bans on content that ""offends or excludes persons, nations, communities, national, ethnic, linguistic and other minorities or any majority as well as any church or religious groups."" 

The initial Media Act at least still provided the media outlet with the possibility of *asking* the judge to suspend the fine pending proceedings. But even this provision was undermined when Parliament passed further amendments last summer which, the above-mentioned study notes, deem ""fines imposed by the Media Authority .. 'public debt' and collectible by the tax authorities regardless of whether the sanction has been challenged in court"".

For balance's sake, I have to add: some of the content provisions which the ""Media Constitution"" established (such as protections of the constitutional order) may already sound dubious to some Western readers but actually occur in other European countries too. But the wording of other ones (such as the one about offending ""any majority"") go further than any European precedent. The fines that are to enforce such provisions are unusually high. And those controversial content provisions and accompanying threats of fines don't just apply to broadcast media, but to print media and ""online press"" as well. All of that is restrictive on a rare to unique degree in Europe (let alone the US).",0,1327099358,null,0,true,0,c3izwnf,t3_onj6d,t1_c3izwnf,t1_c3ivpfl,null,1428211325,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

After the state TV last year first ventured into outright lying, editing an item about Daniel Cohn-Bendit so as to make it look like he fled in a rush from a question about pedophilia when in reality he answered the question robustly and at length, were the perpetrators fired? No. The responsible editor, who used to work for the far-right Jobbik party, was promoted.

It took the new case of the mysteriously airbrushed judge - and lengthy protests about it - to force action. Meanwhile, the state TV has still turned into a reliable mouthpiece of Orban and Fidesz, critical journalists however prominent were among the first to be fired in the mass layoffs, and self-censorship reigns.

&gt;There was a frequency-tender and Klubradio lost. As i read, they didn't want to pay any money for the frequency, demanding a positive bias for themselves. 

You seem to skip a few facts in your narrative. For the other readers here, this is the story: the frequency of a popular and stridently oppositional talk radio station - the only one in the country - was due to run out. So the Media Authority launched a call for applicants for the frequency. But what did it do? It explicitly determined the frequency to be available only for a radio station that would broadcast music. In the end, Klubradio applied anyway, but instead the license was given to a business that was only founded right before, that nobody'd heard of and that had never run a radio station before.

true,Kim147,UKGB,United Kingdom Thanks,"A healthy economy is dependent on 2 factors :-

1) people having money to spend - particularly money that they have earned . Money is hours worked so they need to be working and to be exchanging those hours worked .

2) there being goods and services available that people want to buy . This requires the business sector to be sufficiently creative and adaptive to be able to progressively evolve into many new and different business directions - new products and services . The top down monolithic nature of the EU works against this . The EU is much more pro big business rather than enabling and facilitating small business operation . It needs to remove a lot of it's legislation and regulation and it needs to be completely redesigned .

For example - freedom of trade across borders in the EU only applies to the larger companies - companies operating from a fixed place . Small companies , particularly one person operations such as consultants and contractors , are discriminated against . Redesigning the system such that the single business owner operator could nominate his \ her home country and pay all taxes to that country and derive all benefits from that country would be a good start .

The redesign needs a lot of creative and radical thinking . It is a big challenge to the powers that be and my big fear is that they are just not up to it - they are just not able to look at new ideas and to discuss them and to look at the different ways to do things and to evolve to good solutions .

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; David Cameron’s government imposed a first round of harsh spending cuts in 2010, it utterly failed to revive the British economy as promised. To the contrary, it probably cut a budding recovery short. 

Is that not because the Labour government spent all it could to hide the mess (and buy votes)?

e.g. things like locking the country into expensive PFI deals to build new schools or hospitals. PFI often doesn't work because the government fails to negotiate the best deal (something Labour are crap at), and so we'll be spending (over 25 or 50 or whatever years) far more for a building we don't own and have to pay a company to do anything with (even simple maintenance is likely to be outsourced to them, at whatever price they want, because it's all in the contract some incompetent overpaid civil servant signed under the orders of the politicians).

We also have a load of fire control centres we can't use because they aren't fit for purpose but we will be paying huge amounts to rent for a long time to come (and that's another problem with that government, always trying to ""centralise"" and ""fix"" things that aren't broken). It wouldn't surprise me if the contracts are so well written that the government wouldn't be allowed to find other uses for them, not least without paying even more money.

But that's okay, because some construction company is making a mint from that - and it is ""growth"". Things like this were what the ""budding recovery"" was and not really any attempt to spur the private sector into action. This is especially obvious that just after the government cancelled future PFI plans, the construction industry was screaming tales of woe and some companies collapsed.

I'm not being partisan - I think the current government hasn't done all it could to help spur growth either.

Besides that, from what I heard so far the antipathy between the Cantons is bigger than most people realize: the ethnicities live in good neighbourship.

Not everyone in Switzerland owns a bank. Even though the average Swiss is pretty well off, there remain different languages that they overcome in their political process.

&gt; Belgium just had a government crisis that lasted ~18 months because the two major ethnicities are so divided that it would almost have resulted in the country splitting in two.

A special trait of a system with two major groups is the possibility of deadlock. 

&gt; China

From one kind of dictatorship to the other. Claiming China would be the most similar country to the EU is preposterous.

&gt; That a growing number of English speakers live in Europe may be true, but until the amount reaches 100% and everyone becomes fluently enough to follow a political speech, lingual exclusion exists and this would be unacceptable.

First, both government institutions and the media translate between different languages. Second, there are always hurdles excluding some of the people, even if it's simple illiteracy. 100% are unreachable.

&gt; How are your representatives appointed in your country?

Parties put up lists, either national or state lists. After the election, the first x% (depending on the result) are sent to the parliament. Standard [party-list proportional representation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation), really.

&gt; In any proper democracy, a representative ought to elected from an electoral district, i.e. the place where he lives. That way people know that the representative will actually fight for their benefit, and not for something else. And if he fails to do so, he gets punished by not being reelected next time (or even recalled).

I can already imagine what country that is. Not everyone sees it like that, so calling your way the only ""proper"" way is incredibly arrogant. Geographical proximity doesn't necessarily mean shared values.

&gt; And if you look at how many representatives there are for each country, you'll see immediately that it was consciously designed to be defective: Germany has 96 seats in the parliament. Can you explain to me how 96 people are supposed to handle the political input from 81 million citizens? That's one person for 850 000 citizens, which is ludicrous.

What's ludicrous about that? The EP doesn't micro-manage. According to the principle of subsidiarity, it handles only issues that are best served at the European level. Not social services, not local police, not education.

&gt; A party system is a system that allows people who share a common interest to organize themselves in a way to pursue their political goals. In most countries, parties have chapters for each level of the subsidiary tree (federal, state, regional, communal levels). On EU level this is done via very loose alliances, i.e. there is no concept of coalitions or anything like that.

There are ad-hoc coalitions in the EP based on single issues. I'm not sure what exactly your problem is, here. You can get together with other people who share a common interest and pursue your political goals, what's stopping you?

&gt; My guess is that this is to make it more difficult to realize that the European President is not elected by direct majority vote of the people, but by the governments of the EU countries. If the political leader in my country were elected the same undemocratic way, a coup d'etat or a civil war would be the result.

I'd hope you'd first check and see that there isn't any position called ""European President"" and that a civil war would be kind of an overreaction. There is a president of the European Parliament, recently elected by MEPs. The president of the European Council is more of a ceremonial position, he organises council meetings and so on.

HOWEVER... it's clear that many countries have seen the benefits of tighter integration, and are pursuing that integration, absent the federal institutions that create the strong and secure foundation of integration. See also the current euro crisis.

This leaves the European people in a bit of a bind. You get (or are subject to) certain benefits, like labor mobility, common currency, free movement across interior borders, funding for public works. But you don't get much individual say in how those are developed or distributed. Your participation in EU institutions is at the level of your country.

Of course, if you think about it, you don't get much individual say even in your own country. You elect representatives, and your representation is at the level of your district. And your representative most likely belongs to some political party (association),  and that party may have national objectives that are at odds with yours as an individual. It's the nature of the beast.

Your best chance for more individual say in how things go in the EU is more federalism. The downside is that you lose quite a bit of national sovereignty (given the way the world works now, you probably have way less than you think anyway) (yes, even, or perhaps especially, Britain - and if you're blaming the EU, you're looking in the wrong direction).

true,diespinnendoch,null,null,"&gt;Am 1. Oktober 2011 haben einige Verhandlungspartner das sogenannte Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) unterzeichnet. Dieses plurilaterale Abkomment soll einen neuen “goldenen Standard” für den weltweiten Kampf gegen Produktpiraterie und Urheberrechtsverletzungen im Netz schaffen. Der Text wurde von insgesamt 39 Ländern geheim verhandelt. Nationale Parlamente, internationale Organisationen und die Zivilgesellschaft wurden vollkommen von den Verhandlungen ausgeschlossen. Die einzelnen Bestimmungen des Texts sind so vage gehalten, dass sie Grundrechte einschränken und zu einer privatisierten Zensur im Internet führen werden. Das Abkommen schafft zudem neue strafrechtliche Sanktionen, die nicht nur erhebliche Auswirkungen auf die Meinungsfreiheit, den Zugang zu Kultur und Datenschutz haben werden, sondern auch dem internationalen Handel schaden und Innovation lähmen werden.
&gt;
&gt;Das ACTA-Abkommen wird nun bald auch von der EU und den einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten ratifiziert. Hierfür muss das Europäische Parlament das Abkommen absegnen oder ablehnen. Daher haben wir jetzt die Chance, alle Europaparlamentarier an ihre Verantwortung zu erinnern, sich für unsere Bürgerrechte und den europäischen Binnenmarkt einzusetzen und “Nein” zu stimmen.

I can guarantee you that if the process of European integration is continued in its current fashion, nationalist and separatist sentiments will rise sharply - not tomorrow, but in ten to twenty years, and then civil liberties will be curtailed to contain the terrorism, rioting, and violence that will grow out of this - just like in today's China.

Fair enough.

&gt; (...) multilingualism (...)

It appears to me that the level of translations and the quality of the media are enough for an interested citizen to be able to make informed decisions. Having all documents, all speeches, everything available in every language is not necessary for that, as not even the usual process of opinion making within monolingual groups doesn't go that deep. If there is a heightened necessity for translations, for example here for ACTA, it happens through participative democracy. Pirates, for example, have set up such a group: https://int.piratenpartei.de/Translation_task_force

European democracy will look different from other kinds, as long as no language becomes a standard language. I'm rather confident English will eventually make it.

&gt; How representative is that really? Not much at all, if you ask me. If you disagree, please offer reasons for why you consider it sufficiently representative.

&gt; There are proper ways to choose representatives, and there are improper ones. Please explain why you consider the European way proper.

Easy. My area, for instance, is primarily conservative. Not a majority, just a plurality, enough to make sure that in a constituency there would always be a conservative winner. That would effectively mean no representation for me or the rest of the actual majority.

&gt; It's not about shared values, but loyalty to one's constituents. If people don't have the feeling that the person sitting in parliament for them is one of them, the support for that political system will always be less than weak.

Not really. I want loyalty in values. I elect a party that shares values with me and promises to do something so they become a reality. If they do that, great, if not, I'll vote for someone else. Living in my vicinity isn't particularly helpful.

&gt; Your Reddit flair shows me that you are from Bavaria. Tell me, how would the average Bavarian react if Germany's political system were to be changed in such a way that a person from Berlin would represent him in parliament? I guess ""pissed"" would be the correct answer.

Hard to say. Germany uses ""Mixed Member Proportional System"" for national and state elections. As pointed out before, my area is primarily conservative or sometimes, maybe, social democratic. I have never voted for either party. Instead, my voice only counts through my secondary vote, where I can cast a vote for a list. For national elections, that list is filled with people from all over Bavaria (including Franconia). We can live with that, even though Franconians have a rough relationship with the rest of Bavaria.

For Europe, the list is filled with people from all over Germany, or, if the participating party decides otherwise, there are 16 lists for each state. Just like national elections. Although, truth be told, only one party does that: the conservatives are split into two parties, one for Bavaria, one for the rest, and they want to be able to do that for European elections as well.

&gt; The parliament ought to represent the will of the people, and for that to happen, communication must occur between the representatives and their respective constituents. It doesn't really matter what and how many competences the specific level of subsidiarity has in particular. 96 people are simply not enough to communicate in any meaningful way with the electorate of a country with 81 million citizens, and if that is not possible it defeats the purpose of a parliament.

Yes, and obviously, the amount of communication is proportional to the number and gravity of the issues. I feel it's easier for me to get something from the EP than from the Bundestag, especially because they are not quasi-slaves to a government they elected. A refreshing change from the parliamentary system in place almost everywhere in Europe.

&gt; byzantine complexity of the political system (the number of people who are able to explain how the political system of the EU is supposed to work without looking it up fit into a soccer stadium, and that means it's too complicated for the average citizen; complexity here serves as a means of exclusion which is almost devilish perfidy)

The system is not that complex. In a nutshell, commission drafts legislation, council and parliament amend and approve/reject it. I don't like it, but anyone who doesn't at least know *that* has only himself to blame.

&gt; to much volume (I tried to follow EU legislation and activities closely for a week through OEIL, PRE-LEX, the EP Document Register etc., and the amount of text that goes through there on a daily basis is just mind-boggling)

I elect politicians and donate to relevant interest groups to do that for me. Our society is based on division of labour, I don't see why this principle shouldn't apply to politics at all.

&gt; division along lingual borders

See above.

&gt; the only way into the EU parliament is through national parties, i.e. no option for direct candidates AFAIK

I don't think there is a law against someone running on a one-person-list.

&gt; insufficient funds (the political system of the EU is susceptible to corruption and lobbyism, and unless you are wealthy it is impossible to compete against that)

Who has insufficient funds? MEPs get up to €30 per month. That's about the same as  German federal MPs.

&gt; The EU was never intended to be a democracy in the actual sense, and this is obvious to everyone with a basic understanding of democracy theory. That there are so many people out there who pretend that it is an adequate form of democracy is something that disturbs me deeply because it shows that people don't really know what constitutes good democracy and what doesn't.

I'm not even going to bother responding to that bunch of conspiracy theories. Seriously, sometimes I wonder where all the crazy comes from and how it always ends up on major anglophone websites, never somewhere else.

And which democracy theory are we talking? I just opened my textbook ""introduction to democracy theories"" and the comparison table has 25 different theories, from Aristotle to something called ""transition theory"", all with different criteria for judging a democracy... 

&gt; Civil war would hardly be an overreaction if the political leader (and a significant portion of the people) decided to cripple a democracy so strongly that it would be tantamount to its complete abolition.

Das ist im EU-Ministerrat ein übliches Verfahren. Da sitzen mal die Fischereiminister, mal die Inneminister, mal die Finanzminister etc. und diskutieren die jeweils aktuellen Fragen ihres Themengebietes.

*schnipp*

So ein Gesetzgebungsverfahren, und dazu gehört auch der Beitritt zu einem internationalen Abkommen, ist von den fachlich zuständig Experten schon rauf- und runterdiskutiert worden. Das war dann in diesem Fall sicher auch schon bei den Justizministern Thema. Wenn bei denen die Entscheidung de facto gefallen ist (EU-Jargon: “politische Einigung”), müssen aber nochmal die Beamten drüber, um den abschließenden Text in allen EU-Amtssprachen (23, glaube ich) zu erstellen. Und diese Fassung muss dann aus formalen Gründen nochmal vom Ministerrat beschlossen werden. Ist ne reine Formsache (die inhaltliche Entscheidung ist wie gesagt schon längst gefallen), aber aus rechtlichen Gründen müssen dafür Minister aus den Mitgliedstaaten die Hand heben. Egal welche, man nimmt die, die gerade da sind, und sie bekommen von ihren Leuten aufgeschrieben, wie sie abzustimmen haben.

Damit will ich nichts zur Sache, ob ACTA gut oder schlecht ist, gesagt haben. Aber auch wenn es auf den ersten Blick so aussieht, war das keine Nacht-und-Nebel-Aktion, sondern das ganz normale Verfahren. Und wie im Artikel erwähnt: die Sache muss ja auch noch durchs EU-Parlament.

This is the definition of Islamism according to wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism  

Islamism has been defined as:
	
▪""the belief that Islam should guide social and political as well as personal life"",
	
▪""the [Islamic] ideology that guides society as a whole and that [teaches] law must be in conformity with the Islamic sharia"",

▪an unsustainably flexible movement of ... everything to everyone: an alternative social provider to the poor masses; an angry platform for the disillusioned young; a loud trumpet-call announcing `a return to the pure religion` to those seeking an identity; a ""progressive, moderate religious platform` for the affluent and liberal; ... and at the extremes, a violent vehicle for rejectionists and radicals.
	
▪an Islamic ""movement that seeks cultural differentiation from the West and reconnection with the pre-colonial symbolic universe"",
	
▪""the organized political trend, owing its modern origin to the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in 1928, that seeks to solve modern political problems by reference to Muslim texts"",
	
▪""the whole body of thought which seeks to invest society with Islam which may be integrationist, but may also be traditionalist, reform-minded or even revolutionary"",
	
▪""the active assertion and promotion of beliefs, prescriptions, laws or policies that are held to be Islamic in character,""
	
▪a movement of ""Muslims who draw upon the belief, symbols, and language of Islam to inspire, shape, and animate political activity;"" which may contain moderate, tolerant, peaceful activists, and/or those who ""preach intolerance and espouse violence.""

▪a term ""used by outsiders to denote a strand of activity which they think justifies their misconception of Islam as something rigid and immobile, a mere tribal affiliation.""

Then translate everything. A common language leads to a loss of culture.

&gt; Businessmen and entrepreneurs will most likely disagree with you on that.

Only businesses selling physical goods. Luckily, politics isn't a physical good.

&gt; Guess why. Because hardly anyone communicates with their country's MEPs at all. At least that's my interpretation.

Could be. After all, most issues are already handled at lower levels.

&gt; I don't think you realize it, but with that statement you've just disqualified everything you've written so far. The core question of democracy is: How do we prevent that someone installs a tyranny? The most common method is to install checks and balances in the form of separation of powers. The intention is that everyone controls everyone else so that no one can take over the system. That's why the principle of division of labor does not work here: how are you supposed to assess whether the politicians you elect and the interest groups you donate to do their job properly? You have to replicate their work to a certain degree to make that assessment, and this cannot be outsourced. When people neglect that for whatever reasons, the end result will be Italy under Berlusconi: post-democracy in which the members of a political caste do what they want while the people bask in frustration over their powerlessness.

""To a certain degree"", that's the point.

&gt; I like your cynicism.

I'm don't think of myself as cynical, but thanks.

&gt; Usually when someone pulls the conspiracy theory card on me, I immediately end the discussion. What makes you think that this is a conspiracy theory? Parliamentarism was not unanimously popular back then, and if you look at the EU today you see that it is largely shaped by EU officials you have never heard off. My guess is that over the years the EU became much more powerful than it was originally intended, so the democracy deficits are making themselves felt more painfully than envisioned back then. This is also why I think the UK will withdraw completely from EU: they simply fear a too powerful European Union because they fear a too powerful Germany.

Because there is no coherent plan for technocracy going from the League of Nations to the Treaty of Lisbon. The comparison to the League Of Nations is superficial at best. And, despite what columnists on that page repeat every now and then, neither Italy's nor Greece's new prime minister got their new job in an unconstitutional way.

&gt; How about that on which your own country's system is built? Germany's political system is one of the most robust of the world because it was shaped by the winners of WWII to ensure that something like Hitler would not happen again. They not only included many lessons learned from the Weimar Republic, but also their own democracies. It wouldn't have been the worst approach to simply take the German constitution and model the EU from it. Instead they based their approach on the League of Nations. All I'm saying is that the EU is just not democratic enough to wield the power it currently wields. Now Merkel and Sarkozy want to unify economic and social policies on the EU level. In the current system this is a frightening thought.

The EU is not so different. Germany's legislative system has two chambers. A federal council (Bundesrat) and a federal parliament (Bundestag). The latter is elected up to 50% FPTP, at least 50% proportional. The council is not elected at all, the state governments send 3-6 representatives. Notice the similarity?

I, too, believe the EU needs to be more democratic. But I reject your doomsday visions. I'd like to elect a European President directly and perhaps have him appoint a prime minister with the consent of the parliament -- an empowered parliament with all rights a parliament should have. Or go full American and separate parliament and president completely. Either way, today's EU setup cannot be the final answer.",0,1327177885,null,0,false,0,c3j8pi1,t3_oq5vx,t1_c3j8pi1,t1_c3j8h4k,null,1428215606,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Regarding your first claim, that's a little stretch. According to a number of polls, the Irish rejected Lisbon for things that weren't in the treaty. After they were re-assured ""yes, we really won't touch your tax rate or force you to abort all your babies"", they voted again and *overwhelmingly* (like almost 2:1) agreed to it.

The last two ones are true, however :-( Unfortunately I still believe it's easier to stop such things in the European parliament, where there is no government coalition obeying every command from a chancellor or prime minister, than back home.",0,1327178085,null,0,false,0,c3j8qkr,t3_oq5vx,t1_c3j8qkr,t1_c3j6ugo,null,1428215627,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

But I would still disagree, we don't need less EU but more democracy.  ",0,1327190060,null,0,false,0,c3jai54,t3_oq5vx,t1_c3jai54,t1_c3j7h7w,null,1428216459,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"You probably didn't understood me. I didn't suggest anything. I merely pointed out a huge fact. The rising debt along with lack of sufficient growth, or negative growths (recession!) brings about ratings downgrades and that means more risk and scared off investors. 
I see the problem not just only in the fiduciary/ever growing debt system that is bound to hit non-negotiable natural limits (peak everything!).  The problem is that the market operates on predatory speeds and is highly volatile. Capital is capable of moving at great speeds with little effort. Countries are not as flexible, hence the needed regulation. Right now, both are incompatible and only few will remain standing unless action (regulation) is taken. 

You ask of the debtors and rightly so but the creditors are not suicidal. They know when enough is enough and when to back off over risk of losing 100% of investments. It's a country's or EU negotiation power and skills that can make the difference here. Haircuts can be negotiated as can time-frames and even rules. Ofcourse it isn't being negotiated because banksters own the world's legislative process and make sure 100% debt is paid in full. But as you've witness with Greece, they took a haircut when facing higher losses, which means they bleed as well. It isn't a conspiracy. It is a natural expectation in the final days of a predatory capitalist society - ever increasing power and wealth to those who already have it.
 
As an example of how bad things are just look at Portugal. We have a IMF loan of  5.5% and a negative growth. We need to grow more than 5% a year to cope with those rates. Even on a 15 year time-frame, it is impossible.  There are no predictions that in the coming decade we'll be controlling the deficit and growing enough as the BRICS! It's insane!

Why then, did they loan in the first place? Because of the many measures that the IMF imposes. Privatization of Social Security, Health services, water, land and power companies.  That and making sure the money flows towards the banks and 12bn have already flowed in their way from an 80bn loan.

The future is corporatization. Financial clusters owning entire countries and their citizens, dictating policies and exerting total-control over everything. Why? I don't know... For eons that conquering has been a human trait and power corrupts everything. Could also be a natural thing to occur in a capitalist society. All past civilizations fell. 

But we still have a chance to balance things out and that is within our current and rapidly closing time-frame. If we do nothing we'll deserve whats coming.",0,1327191551,null,0,true,0,c3japym,t3_oogy6,t1_c3japym,t1_c3jahe1,null,1428216557,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

They were created when cheap money flowed to Spain inflating prices.  Normally these problems would be solved with monetary policy. Either exchange rate of currency drops and/or there is inflation. But now Spain is stuck with same currency as Germany.

This is not about standard of living. This austerity is about destroying economic activity and deepening downturn. If create bankruptcies and increase unemployment, it wrecks the economy for decades. 

If these countries hand their own currencies, the exchange rate of peseta and lira would drop, making foreign products more expensive and exports cheaper for outside world. There would be  decrease standard of living, but people would still have jobs and companies could sell stuff. Now everything just halts.

But most Germans are probably very understanding in cultural differences and a lot of the classical manners are very relaxed by now. If you are from a western culture then you probably won't have much trouble. Try to be observant.

Very important is that the German language and culture makes a distinction on how to address someone you are familiar with or superiors, people you don't know. The first one is ""Du"" and the second ""Sie"". Traditionally you'd address anybody you don't know or your superiors with ""Sie"" and surname. The ""Du"" is offered if persons are more familiar. It's always the older person or person of hire rank offering the ""Du"". But this has been relaxed and it is common that students call each other ""Du"". However you should always address professors with title and surname.

There already was a discussion about tipping. In Germany all prices are including taxes and service. So tipping is more to reward good service. It should be no more than 10% except for really great service.

Of course your should hold the door open for other people.

Hand shaking is common as a greeting and as farewell. Especially for males a strong grip is expected. If you are a male and being introduced to a woman you should wait if she extents her arms for a hand shaking.

Middle finger (German ""Stinkefinger"") is the same as in most western country and considered an insult. You can even get sued for showing it as an insult.

Be on time!

Germans are very direct. They don't try to cover up criticism and they don't hand out praise so easily. Try not to be insulted too quickly.

Don't wear a hat inside. Especially not at the dinner table.

If you enter an office remain standing until the host invites you to sit down.

At a dinner don't start eating before everybody has a plate and the host said ""Guten Appetit"" (good appetite). You should also try to eat everything on your plate. Left overs are considered a sign that you didn't like the food.

When drinking it's common to toast before taking the first sip. Especially with beer you should knock glasses together and look into each other's eye. A typical toast is ""Prost"" or ""Zum Wohl"" (good health).

Don't talk about history, unless it is with someone you know well, or if someone brings it up. The Germans who are alive today are no more responsible for what happened than I am for what my government has done, and I think that they are frankly tired of being held accountable. Well, this is at least what my German friend has told me. I know if I had to constantly answer for what my president has done/is doing, I would get tired of it. 

Don't expect eye contact when walking down the street. I live in the Southern US, so this was a real shock to me. After a month or two, you get used to it. 

Being punctual is very important. If you will be late for some reason, let the people expecting you know. Better yet, just don't be late. 

As for tipping, the first time I went out to eat with a German friend, I tried to leave a traditional 20% US tip, and was told that it wasn't necessary. I frankly didn't believe her, so she called the waitress over and had her explain to me that is isn't like the US, and they are paid a fair wage and don't really expect tips. She suggested that if I felt like I needed to tip, I should just round up to the next Euro, or I could leave a Euro per person at the table, but she said that would be a high tip. 

Germans are very concerned with the environment, so it is a good idea to learn the rules of recycling fast. My apartment had 4 dumpsters in the back -  2 for trash, 1 for paper and 1 for compostable kitchen scraps. At the end of the block was big containers for glass recycling by color.

When walking, don't cross the street when the signal tells you not to. We got quite a few dirty looks when we got tired of standing at the light on a deserted street. If a German friend was with us, he would wait and not cross with us, and then tell us we were setting a bad example for the children (who weren't there.) 

Germans are very direct and at first it can come across as a little harsh, but after a while you will begin to appreciate it. Now that I am back in the US, I wish more Americans would just say what they mean.

Your cell phone is a Handy, and don't use it while driving. It is against the law.

The grass isn't always greener in Europe.  There is a high unemployment rate there, and if you were to find a job, salaries are way lower than in the USA.

The only countries that might be doing well are Germany, Holland and Scandinavian countries.  And obviously Switzerland.

However, the rest of the countries, have nothing to offer in terms of jobs.  Then again, I don't know what your profession is, but if you are in IT, that might be the only profession that offers you a job in good places.  Otherwise, good luck finding a high paying job.

Living in Europe is extremely expensive if you want to live in a nice area or a decent apartment.  Of course, that's the same in California because things are extremely expensive there, but my friend who lives in south florida pays about 1000 dollars for a 600 something square foot apt.   It is a gated community and fairly modern apt probably built in early 2000.  In Europe, something like that might run you way more than 1000 euros.  Problem is, salaries in Europe are very low.  Also, an apt like that in Texas, might run you 800 dollars, and salaries there are fairly good so 800 dollars is actually not bad.But again, don't know your profession...

My point is, Europe is a nice place to live in if you can get a decent paying job. Problem is, decent paying jobs are hard to come by; and if you do find a job, then most likely it won't pay you so high, so then you're limited to living with flatmates, or living on your own in a ghetto community.  Of course, Europeans call that living with exotic neighbors. Fuck that shit.

If i were in your shoes, i would select a 2-3 countries where you want to move, then look to see what jobs they have, and then find out the cost of an apartment, cost of living, etc.

Now, to answer your questions, if your country is part of the EU, then legal hurdles aren't bad at all; let's say you're from Italy and you move to Belgium because of a job, all you have to do is go register that you live in Belgium and I guess you pay taxes to the city you live in and not sure what else.  But legally, is like moving from Cali to Florida.  You just take care of stuff like driving license change, tax filing is different, etc.
If you're not from the EU, then things get a bit more complicated, but not well versed on that; i Just have a lot of friends who are from EU countries and they move all over the place because of their jobs and the biggest hassle they have is moving their shit and registering their name in the new country or something like that.  In other words, not a big deal.

Countries worth moving to....well, wherever you can find a high paying job to suit your lifestyle.  Rome might be a beautiful city, but good luck finding a job that's going to pay you more than 1000 euros a month; and then good luck finding an apt that is going to be less than 1000 euros a month. Unless of course, you're a female and you meet up Berlusconi.

Germany seems to be a place that has a lot of jobs and they seem to pay well there too; that's one of the few places where a lot of my european friends have moved to and they seem to be doing well; Holland might another one, and Scandinavian countries.  Belgium isn't bad either, specially if you get a job in the govt, but good luck with that.  Switzerland always has great salaries, and even though cost of living is high, at least the good salaries make up for that.

Spain, Portugal, Greece---good to visit, once you have that good paying job! :D  Although I do have a couple of friends living in Spain, and they are  doing well in their IT jobs, but they are the entrepreneurial type of people.
Then a lot of other Spaniards I know have moved to the UK or any other country where they can find a job. Hell, just google indignados and see what comes up. I bet those people are dying to move to the USA.

But as far as moving to europe because you think you'll improve your quality of life by getting a high paying job or getting a job, good luck.

I would move to Texas or maybe the East coast because California is a nasty state period.  Taxes are high, and they are still thinking of increasing more taxes.  I remember once I was offered a job for 75k in South Cali, and i thought, damn, that's pretty good; then i looked at rent, taxes, and apt rent, and the 75k was a shit of a salary, unless I got a few roommates to live with.   Same salary in Texas or Florida, takes you a long way.

But do your research and compare.  You might be surprised.  Then again, if you're fairly young, move and treat it like an adventure and learning experience.

And by the way...if you base your choice because of health insurance, I've worked in the usa, and i've had health insurance every time.  I think things get rough once you work for places like taco bell, mcdonalds, or any part time job. Somehow, Europeans believe that health insurance in the usa does not exist, which is totally BS.  Yes, it is a bad situation, but if you get a good job, not bad at all.

Addition:  I was just reading the news, and this is something that is in fashion in europe: austerity measures salary cuts.  Even though the article below is in spanish, use google chrome to translate. But basically people are protesting because they are getting salary cuts and guess what? everythign else stays the same or the prices go up.

true,teelanovela,null,null,"here's some more:

* Greeting People: „Du“ vs. „Sie“
When meeting people in Germany for the first time, address them by using the formal  
pronoun “Sie“. Children are always addressed as “Du”, even if they are strangers.
Sometimes during the development of a professional relationship you will be offered 
the “Du” at a certain point. It is up to you to accept or decline but you should know 
that being “per Du” with someone implies a stronger connection, trust and confidence.
German people are said to be very loyal, so if you reach the “Du” with someone, in 
many cases you can expect this person to be even more dependable than usual.
The Rule: Among friends say „Du“ - among strangers say “Sie“!
As always there are exceptions to the rule and so you will find people who will some-
times say ”Du“ to strangers in shops, on the street, etc. 
But: If you are dependent on the benevolence of the person you are talking to, e.g. you 
need that person to give you a visa or agree to a business proposition – in all cases be 
polite! – use “Sie“. Saying “Du” to a superior can be seen as an affront!

* In a restaurant, don't wait at the entrance!
When you go to a restaurant in Germany and wait for someone to show you to a table 
you will stand there and wait in vain.
The Rule: Look around, select a table and sit down. But make sure there is no sign 
saying „Reserviert“ (reserved).
There are exceptions to this rule in two cases: Either the restaurant you're going to is a 
certain branch of non-native franchise, e.g. Pizza Hut or the restaurant is severely up-
per class. In both cases there will be someone waiting for you at the entrance.

* In a packed restaurant be prepared to share your table!
If the table you're sitting has two seats left and those are the only ones left in the res-
taurant people might ask you nicely if they can sit down next to you.
If you are in a situation where you enter a crowded restaurant and spot an empty seat,  
you can do the same. 
Don't be afraid! Although you might sit together with strangers around a table, people 
generally ignore each other's conversations as if they're not even hearing what the oth-
er party is saying. But if you want to discuss something highly confidential, this might 
not be the best place!
The Rule: If seats are rare, people share.

* Paying the Bill
In Germany it is very common that each person pays only for what he or she has eaten 
and drunk. It is very rare that one person pays for everything and then the others con-
tribute after the bill has been paid.
Usually you call the waiter over and he will put the bill on the table. Together with the 
others you calculate who has to pay what amount. In many cases the waiter will even 
ask „Getrennt oder zusammen?“ (together or separate) and calculate individual 
amounts for you. It's not considered penny-pinching but is very common.
The Rule: Every person pays for what he or she has consumed.
There are exceptions when being invited in a business context, by family members or – 
of course if you are on a date. In those cases the bill will often be paid by one person. 
Also be careful if paying a meal for an acquaintance of the opposite sex. It might send a 
signal you are not intending to send!

**""How are you"" (""Wie geht's?"")** is a typical opener, too, but rare it is met with *""I'm ecstatic like a pink flying unicorn during cocaine-driven sex! And you?""* *""Me too! What a great conincidence! ""*

As someone described a typical German reaction: grunt, shrug, move on. A ""geht so"" (so-so) is not an euphemized ""it sucks"", but rather a ""nothing important to talk about"".

**Service people** compared to the US attitude of ""Even if my day sucks, why should this affect you?"", it is often more like *""My day sucks - why should I put on a fake smile and  lie to you?""*

**Restaurants** - very much unlike the US, it is not common to be rushed away from your table after finishing your last dish. you can sit, stay, talk, maybe have a drink or a coffee. If they ask ""anything else"" you can reply  ""Erstmal nicht"" (""not right now""). You leave after you pay. -- I wouldn't press that in a very busy place, though, and while sitting for half an hour or longer without any orders is OK it deserves a good tip.

**For tipping:**  No tip if the service sucked. No problem if you don't tip at fast food and snack carts, ""student clubs"" and the like . Rounding up to the next euro is polite. In a typical restaurant, 10% is a good tip, ~5% is expected - but not in the New York way of ""just 15%? I keeel YOU!"". At a posh place more is apparently common, though this doesn't make much sense to me. 

**First contact** with passing strangers (say, asking for the way) is usually more reserved than in the US, in some regions, people may appear an inch short of hostile. Don't take that personally - in my home place it often takes quite a while for people to warm up. After that happens, they won't let you go anymore, though. 

**Shake hands** very frequent as a regular greeting, supposedly even more common in east germany. Usually accompanied by a slight nod or more formally with a slight bow. Sticking out your hand in the wrong situation can be a faux pas, so accept but don't be to eager yourself.

That's how economy works everywhere. If country has boom and central bank fuels it with cheap money, it will create bubble that is not sustainable. Prices increase creating inflation. Normally central banks increase their rates to cut down inflation and slow down the economy. 

This is not how eurozone works for smaller countries. Eurozone is unoptiomal currency area. ECB sets its rates mostly to follow what Germany does as it's the biggest economy by far. When Germany had hard times and was recovering overall inflation in eurozone was low, but southern regions had economic boom. Without their own monetary policy, Spain and Italy had no way to cool down their economies. They could only take care of public spending and that they had under control.   

Economic cycles in EU countries can be out of sync. Spain especially is in situation where monetary policy works against it. When it has boom, ECB fuels it. When it has recession, ECB makes it deeper.

Drinking is not very formal anyway, unless you're attending a wine tasting or something like it. It's very relaxed and foreigners often toast like they are used to.

As a German I find the lack of tolerance of criticism, esp. when communicating with English speakers, very disturbing. But this seems to also the case with other nationalities and it is also creeping into the German society (Rate a deal ""neutral"" on Ebay and people get mad at you). The problem this that calling something bad or criticizing it is deemed impolite. Especially in the case of US Americans which hold the right of free speech so high, it confuses me that criticism is marked with this kind of social stigmata. But coming back to the topic, this might be more of a problem of Germans going abroad. If you're visiting Germany be prepared that they seem to criticize everything.

true,starbuckzero,BAVA,Bayern,"I'll add a few thoughts on the many excellent things people have written here, already:

Punctuality is important and being late is generally considered rude in any official context (class, office appointments, etc.) but not necessarily in private interactions. When invited to a party (and there'll be many in student circles) no one expects you to show up at 8 when the host says ""Saturday 8pm at my place, bring beer"". Show up at 9. However, when meeting someone for dinner or coffee or if someone invites you to their house to cook / watch a movie at a certain time - be punctual. 

One thing I never particularly noticed (I am German after all) but which was pointed out by ALL my American and British friends I met here - apparently Germans stare. A lot. At you. And apparently it is weird. YMMV. 

The directness that can come off as rude certainly is true - most people say what they think or say nothing at all - there is a lot less sugar coating criticism, especially in work environments (and to a certain degree also at uni during discussions at classes, etc.). You'll get used to it, just don't take it personally. 

Most Germans will flat out deny that but let's be real - most of us LOVE if things go by the book. Train on time, trash neatly sorted into our 5 different garbage cans, staircase being swept once a week, mail being delivered the next day, etc. If stuff is accurate and in order we are happy, even if we are not aware of it and pretend to be all relaxed and easy about things. A nation under OCD if you want.

Regarding dating - it's true, dating is a lot less formal and a lot more fluid than in the US - usually you will hang out with a circle of people for a few times before you ask someone out for a 1 on 1, usually for coffee in the afternoon or a movie. Don't be discouraged if you ask someone out and he / she will ask if he / she can bring his / her friend, it's normal. 

You asked about dining and your friend's meal being late - usually he / she will stay ""go ahead, start without me"", if he / she doesn't say anything - just ask if it's ok if you start. 

Most people aren't really big on smalltalk unless they know each other to a certain degree, which can make things awkward in some situations as you'll have little to talk about. Many people are not as open and outgoing, especially not about their personal lives. As you'll go to university there should be enough topics to cover with fellow students though. 

Topics that should generally be avoided in conversations as little good will come out of it: religion (widely considered a private thing), income (unless it's student jobs like waiting tables at the cafe or the helping out at the library etc, then it's ok to ask) and politics (though you should be prepared to be confronted about the US foreign policy and the stance on gun control as these are 2 popular things people like to bash the US about). Other than that - people are more reserved here until they know you and many keep different social circles for work and free time - but that doesn't necessarily apply to students so you should be fine. 

Germans also have a different definition of ""personal space"" in public, so people might stand closer to you in a line, on the bus, etc than you are used to. There's just a lot more people living here in a much smaller space so your personal zone will be smaller as well, this might feel uncomfortable at first.

If you want to learn German and practice speaking German to people - be persistent. Most people will automatically switch to English once they realize you are American, to practice their own language skills and to make things easier for you. Just keep replying in German or politely ask them to speak German so you can learn.

true,jmact1,null,null,"We've been in Germany going on 18 months, half in Bavaria, half near Frankfurt.  We went through ""learning"" all the German customs, like the OP, including books and much internet content specific to the subject.  It is important to note that almost none of these are universal rules, there are always exceptions.  For example, I can't imagine a server objecting to a 20% ""tip"", and we've seen servers become demanding and hostile when no tip was given.  Most stores, the salesclerks will wait for you to ask for help, some stores (eg clothing) the sales people will accost you upon entering, ala USA.  For every hard-n-fast driving rule I had drummed into my head, I've seen countless German drivers ignore it.  Note that I have yet to see police pull someone over here- almost all traffic enforcement is done with cameras.  You break rules constantly, especially at first, and if you are unlucky to get ""flashed"", you will get a ticket in the mail in the distant future.  Also note there are significant regional differences in language and customs (think about North and South in the US).

The biggest issue for us, the longer we live here, is the language barrier.  I devoted time to trying to learn some German when I first arrived, only to be told several times by Germans, when I tried to use my German, that they did not speak English (they apparently thought my German attempts were actually English).  Many Germans speak some English, many don't.  It is always interesting to find out which German can speak English or not.  Often the manager of the store can't, but the kid selling hot dogs at the snack bar will speak perfect teen-age American (Ikea being the example I think of).  Almost always there is someone in the store or business who speaks some English, and when they find out you only speak English, they will go find the person.  Most, of not all German websites are only in German with no option for English, even though some of them actually have a few English pages which you can only find if you Google for them.  Expect to frequently use Google Translate, and don't expect it to be a perfect translation each time.   We realized after awhile that if you ask for the Englisch menu at most restaurants, you will get a truncated version, so either get both to compare or learn to decipher the German menu.  If you buy a gizmo, the instructions will be in 40 different languages, none in English.

Make ABSOLUTELY SURE all your electric/electronic devices will auto-switch from 110 to 220v. Forget those stupid little brick-like travel adapters with all the buttons and slides, they don't switch voltage, just the plug configuration.  For stuff that auto-switches, like your iPod, you'll need a simple flat adapter from the US two blade to the Euro two prong, flat so your US ground prong will sit off to the side.  You should find one for under a dollar or you can pay $10 for one at Radio Shack.  If you do bring something 110v, be fully proficient in figuring out wattage and how big a transformer brick you will need and mark the cord to show it will blow if you plug into 220v.  A 110v. hair curler will require a brick that weighs a couple of kilos.  Forget your Keurig- that will be one the size and weight of a cinder block.

Not sure if use of money has been discussed, but most places do not accept credit cards, and Germans do not do bank checks like the US.  Be prepared to pay cash (get a German wallet with a change purse) and pay it quickly (lots of stress getting through checkouts at groceries.  Oh, you have to bring your own bags and pack them yourself, and you'll need a €- or US quarter- for the carts).  Instead of cash or checks, Germans do bank transfers (German bank-to-bank).  If you are going to be in Germany for any length of time, set up a German bank account with some cash for transfers and an ATM card.  Deutsche Bank and BOA have an exchange agreement where you don't pay fees for ATM withdrawals, so use a BOA debit card for German DB ATMS.

Germans love rules and expect everyone to know and abide by them.  There are rules for everything.  But they will push the limits of rules (if the speed limit is 60kph, they will drive 65 regardless of traffic or conditions, and if you are holding them up, they will blast their horn at you).  However, Germans also love other cultures, especially US, for their freedom from many of the German rules and reduced stress.  US is a popular destination for German tourists, as is UK, and they love foreign food and goods (plenty of Germans would rather eat Thai than German and recognize Toyotas are a better buy than VW's).",0,1327226832,null,0,true,0,c3jexla,t3_oqpen,t1_c3jexla,t3_oqpen,null,1428218539,8,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,8

true,flyingorange,VOJV,Vojvodina,"Actually most world travelers I've met were working in IT so I think there's something in the mentality that makes these people travel. Perhaps it's the stress, or the thought that there must be life outside the cubicle?

The prices in Europe vary dramatically. What costs 5 euros in France may cost 8 euros in Denmark, and 50 cents in Hungary. Most people say that in Western Europe you need 50 eur/day for a reasonably comfortable travel. In Eastern Europe this goes down to 30 eur/day. 

Myself I've been using Couchsurfing, haven't been going to restaurants, tried to hitchhike as much as possible, and spent around 20 eur/day in Western Europe and about the same in the east. But this is not what most people would call comfortable travel. I just want you to know that this is possible.

The Schengen Area covers most of Europe and you can travel within this area on the same visa. The visa is valid for 90 days, after it expires you must leave the area and not come back for another 90 days. This is a simple explanation, it becomes more complicated if you enter and exit the area frequently, then you should actually calculate your days, but I'm not going to go into that. The UK, Ireland, Romania, Balkan countries are not part of the Schengen treaty, but I don't think you need visas to enter these countries. You should check your State Department website just to be sure.

Many countries use the Euro for currency, but not all of them. The UK, Denmark, Sweden and most of Eastern Europe don't. There are ATMs everywhere so getting the local currency shouldn't be a problem, unless you end up in some village of 500 people that doesn't have an ATM. Note that if you travel by train, it can actually happen that you must change trains in a small village.

Try to avoid using taxis as much as possible. In Western Europe they're outrageously expensive, in Eastern Europe they're cheap, but they might try to scam you if they see you're a tourist.

If you have an ICS card then use it! Most museums, churches and exhibitions can be entered for very cheap if you have an ICS card.

Regarding scams, Europe is not exactly India, but you should still keep your guard up. At train stations never lose sight of your luggage. Whenever someone comes to you wanting to help, without you asking for help, assume that he's trying to scam you. Whenever you see some people playing some game on the street that involves money, assume that it's a scam. When exchanging money always use an ATM, and if there really isn't one to be found then ask the bank clerk to write down on a piece of paper how much money you will get, *before* you give them your money. If they refuse to do this then get out of there fast! If you get stopped on the street by a man asking if you want to have sex with beautiful girls assume that it's a scam. When someone offers to clean your shoes assume it's a scam. Oh and look out for pickpocketers on every large square with lots of tourists, such as the Vatican, the Louvre etc.

Regarding languages, most of the ""Germanic speaking"" countries will know English, and most of the ""Romance speaking"" countries won't. So it would be useful to learn the basics of, for example, Spanish, and it will help you out in France, Italy etc. In Eastern Europe more people speak English but it's not 100%.

Also texting is called ""SMS schreiben"" e.g. ""ich schreib dir eine SMS"" = ""I'll text you"".
Some people already said that you should be punctual. When you invite people to your home or you host a party, expect some people to be over punctual, meaning they turn up 10 to 15 minutes before . This is very common and the people that do this usually want to help you prepare the party or whatever.  

Also drinking beer is completely different than in the US. It is very normal to see people drinking beer in public and in restaurants for lunch.  In Germany, beer is not considered a mere beverage.  It is part of our culture and you should avoid saying anything negative about it. If you don't like it (what I highly doubt but anyway) don't say it out loud. Keep it to yourself and say you're not a beer drinker.  I've seen people getting beat up because they dared to say it's shit (I'm not kidding here). 

Oh and don't expect to see sausages everywhere. They are not our main dish and even a lot of Germans hate them.

The problem is that the higher education needed for a job the less important knowledge of the local language will be.

That's because muslims are a large immigration group (this makes them hard to ignore), they have a strong culture and they often refuse to give that up in exchange for the culture of the country they're living in.

Eg, i should have the right to marry of my child because i could do that **there**, i should have the right to beat my wife because i could do that **there**, i should have halal because it's part of my tradition it doesn't matter if it's animal cruelty. *I exaggerate a bit but things like these.*

What im saying is, a large part of the muslim group is pretty stubborn in keeping the backward parts of their culture and want us to change and not them, and it's hard for any political movement to adress that without being called an ignorant racist.

Yet it is a problem, and instead of adressing it my government has resorted to ignoring it. We now have an immigration we cannot handle. There's too many pouring in while the first batch is still not used to living here. This is creating slumms of ethnicities, most of which are muslim, because, muslims are one of the largest group of a different culture that immigrates here, and sadly a lot do not have a higher education and the job market around here kinda requires that.

We also have to deal with their racism and intolerance (we're bad enough on our own), and jews now have to avoid one of our biggest cities.

Thing like this are furthering the idea in many people that muslims are bad, without any context, which is sad, of course it is, there are many in the muslim group who works hard, are friendly and respects western culture.

But like i said, instead trying to fix it our major parties are pretending there are no problems, which leaves the masses with little option but to vote for the more extreme parties. Which only really have to have one agenda to gain popularity: **get ridd of the muslims**. They can add some crap after that and people stops listening because they've heard what they wanted to hear.

Had the bigger parties had some decent suggestions on what to do here they would've gained much of the votes for the extremist parties, things like:

* Limit immigration of these groups (atleast temporarily)
* Encourage them to get adult education
* Don't put them alltogether in a cheap apartment complex (yeah they do that here)

So when i say im for it, i don't mean i want these people to get elected someday. I just like that they're putting exposure on the issue.

I don't see why. Scots are members of the UK, and are members of the UK. Going independent from the UK doesn't necessitate going independent from the EU in anything other than a technical manner, and I doubt that from a legal perspective the Scottish people can be denied EU membership for their country, given that it goes against internal rules of the EU to remove EU citizenship from Scots.

Yes, they are members of the EU *now*, due to the fact that they are British citizens.  But the SNP are arguing something stronger.  They argue that Scots are members of the EU irrespective of their British citizenship status, that should they stop being British citizens that they will continue being EU citizens as if EU citizenship can be conferred independently of citizenship of a host nation, and that once EU citizenship is conferred it is inviolate.

Noticeably, the SNP never indicate a point of law that actually supports their contention.  Their argument essentially boils down to ""who would think such a thing?""  Not good enough, I'm afraid.

Still bigger than it was supposed to be (but so is Germany's), but calling the corrupt southern half ""irresponsible"" is being nice, it is a huge problem, and it's not going to be solved by giving them more money?

&gt;Why should money from Finland support corruption in Naples?

Why should the rich Northern Italy  support the south? If we want to belong to the same currency area, then we have to do that. The thing is, we Europeans started Eurozone for political reasons while many economists warned that eurozone is not optimal currency region. Some economists warned about this early on, but it was big political project. Now we have the same currency and free movement of money, but other aspects of currency zone are not there. 

To ease the imbalances there should either have:

1. Automatic money transfers between regions, but we lack the solidarity and trust to each other. 
2. Labor mobility across the region. Spaniards could move to France and Germany, but  we have cultural and language barriers that prevent that. 

I think it's unfair for everyone that people have to suffer for no reason because European elites had vision of united future. Greece and Italy would be going along with their own currencies. Greece would devalue its' currency every second decade or so, and markets would demand higher interest rates from them. 

If you want to spread blame, Private banks are good targets. The Banks are in risk management business. How in the hell they could give loans to Greece at the same rate as Germany, same currency or not? One of the biggest moral mistakes made was the fact that Germans and France wanted to rescue their private banks from mistakes they made. They should have nationalised their failed banks.

Nobody was even talking about a new constitution before the 2010 elections, i think it wasn't at that time even in Orbán's mind either. There was a provision in the old constitution, that a ""new constitution shall be made"", as the old was considered a ""temporary"" since 1989.

The elections had two rounds. Fidesz had win the first round, although the super-majority was not yet decided. 
In between the two rounds the Socialist party started to campaign on the slogan that Fidesz will make a new constitution if they get a super-majority, and that people should vote for the Socialists instead to prevent Fidesz from getting the 2/3 majority. So it was actually the Socialists who opened the question of a new constitution.
Fidesz did not deny it, nor did they confirm it. As typical for the election rhetoric Orbán promised ""the bigger the win, the faster the changes"".

After the second round, Fidesz increased its advantage even more, and gained the 2/3 super-majority. 
Later, that was interpreted by Fidesz, that the Socialists have put the question of a new constitution to the elections as a stake, and have lost. And since Fidesz increased its majority even more, that means that more voters actually voted for Fidesz to make a new constitution, and not for opposition, which if it got more votes could have prevented it.

So, tho its a bit harsh to look at elections as on a poker game, to have bets placed to be won or lost, but there is some logic in this. The Socialists have put the constitution as bet on the elections, and have probably lost more than if they didn't have done it.

From what i think, after the elections, Fidesz recapped what the Socialists had said during the elections, and started to consider making the new constitution, since it was brought into public debate already. But i think the majority would have accepted it even without this poker game in the elections. Just the provision in the ""temporary"" constitution would have been a sufficient justification.",0,1327253484,null,0,false,0,c3jh5uf,t3_orht5,t1_c3jh5uf,t1_c3jg763,null,1428219657,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Gymnasium in Germany: A school.

Gymnasium is meant to prepare you for entrance into a University. These days most states don't have a Hauptschule anymore and Reforms are passed in some state every year. Also there are many ways and secondary routes to switch between schools and to get an Abitur. (A-Level counterpart, awarded at the end of 12th grade and made up out of your grades in 11th, 12th grade as well as your grades on final exams)

The reason why they are little vague about who they are is maybe because it isn't that clear for them too. For example the last maybe 8 years they have declared to be a working peoples party, that they progress and advance society where people can and do work. In the past they were more associated on being party of the well-to-do and entrepreneurs, but since the disappearance of the USSR and Finland becoming more or less classless society, they have become more liberal, more representing people who think that people should take more personal responsibility about their lives. Of course there are differing opinions.

Außerdem sehe ich ein, das ""Quatsch"" keine gute Diskussionsgrundlage ist.

Wären wir in den USA, wo mehr auf Bürgerbeteiligung gesetzt wird, fände ich Tafeln sehr notwendig. In Europa mit seinen Sozialstaatssystemen betrachte ich Tafeln als falsch. Und die Leute im Müll anderer Leute nach Verwertbarem suchen zu lassen auch. Ich gebe dir recht, es ist tatsächlich besser Dumpstern zu dekriminalisieren. Eine Petition sollte mEn. aber eher für dafür sorgen, dass das keiner tun muss. Ich weiss, das ist eine theoretische Position die ich da vertrete. Deshalb habe ich auch dafür plädiert eher die Tafeln gesetzlich zu unterstützen, als Bedürftige zwischen Verschimmeltem und Schmodder das Verwertbare raus suchen zu lassen.

Ich bin in meiner Ambivalenz ja nicht allein. Sogar die Betreiber der Tafeln selbst sind ihrem Tun nicht unkritisch gegenüber. 

[Linderung statt Bekämpfung der Armut](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafel_%28Organisation%29#Kritik_an_der_Tafel)

&gt;Mit der Ausgabe von Lebensmitteln kann Armut gelindert, aber nicht die Armut und deren Ursachen beseitigt werden. Horst Krank, Vorsitzender der LudwigsTafel, weist deswegen auf die Verantwortung der Politik hin unabhängig von den Tafeln Armut zu bekämpfen und sieht die Tafeln als „Mahner“. Anlass zu kritischen Beurteilungen von Wissenschaftlern und anderen Wohlfahrtsorganisationen zur Außenwirkung der deutschen Tafeln bietet jedoch unter anderem, dass die Tafelarbeit trotzdem in der Medienberichterstattung und Öffentlichkeit teils als genügende Absicherung gegen Armut erscheint und die eigentliche Armutsbekämpfung laut einigen Kritikern dadurch in den Hintergrund trete.
&gt;
&gt;Kritische Fragen zu Tafeln, verbunden mit einer verbandlichen Positionierung, enthält vor allem das Eckpunktepapier des Deutschen Caritasverbandes. Die Arbeit der Tafeln wird als notwendige und gute Akuthilfe gelobt, dabei aber betont, dass sie keine Dauerlösung sein könnten. Die Ausgabe von Lebensmitteln und Waren sei allein noch nicht geeignet, die individuellen oder auch strukturellen Ursachen von Armut zu bekämpfen. Deshalb solle auch für Bedingungen eingetreten werden, die den „Befähigungsgedanken“' in den Mittelpunkt stellen und den Anspruch des Sozialgesetzbuches auf „selbstbestimmte Teilhabe“ unterstützen. In dem Papier wird gewarnt:
&gt;
&gt;    „Es wäre fatal, wenn die politischerseits gern gesehene Tafelbewegung dazu beiträgt, dass sich der Staat mit Hinweis auf die Bürgergesellschaft aus der Daseinsvorsorge seiner Bürger sukzessive zurückzieht.“
&gt;
&gt;    – Deutscher Caritas-Verband
&gt;
&gt;Grundlage für die Sorge, dass der Staat als Reaktion auf die Hilfe durch Dritte die Mittel kürzen könnte, die er im Rahmen seiner Fürsorgepflicht für Bedürftige aufbringen müsste, ist § 9 SGB I. Dort heißt es: „Wer nicht in der Lage ist, aus eigenen Kräften seinen Lebensunterhalt zu bestreiten oder in besonderen Lebenslagen sich selbst zu helfen, und auch von anderer Seite keine ausreichende Hilfe erhält [sic!], hat ein Recht auf persönliche und wirtschaftliche Hilfe, die seinem besonderen Bedarf entspricht, ihn zur Selbsthilfe befähigt, die Teilnahme am Leben in der Gemeinschaft ermöglicht und die Führung eines menschenwürdigen Lebens sichert. Hierbei müssen Leistungsberechtigte nach ihren Kräften mitwirken.“

Ich bin nicht antisozial. Und will auch nicht wegen prinzipieller Überlegungen Menschen verhungern lassen. Das für mich menschenunwürdige Mülldurchsuchen zuzulassen ergibt für mich aber keinen Sinn und ich sähe das Engagement lieber bei der Bekämpfung der Grundlagen von Armut.

Restrictions for US citizens in the Schengen Area are 90 out of the last 180 days.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; As an EU citizen, what, if any, are the legal hurdles I might face living and working in a country other than the one of my birth?

For everything economic, like employment, starting a business or owning property, you are equal to nationals. Differences come into play as soon as you have to rely on the social net, at least during the first few years. In principle, you have to be able to make your own living outside of your home country. If you decided to attend university, you'd pay the same tuition fees, if any, as nationals, but wouldn't have access to the same student aid programs. If your community college degree isn't equivalent to a Bachelor's, then your high school diploma would have to meet some relatively high standards for admission.

The grass-is-greener effect is always a factor, it wouldn't be easy to adjust, not just socially and culturally. There are plenty of things that do work quite well over here, though. But Europe isn't monolithic, there are some quite substantial social, economic and especially cultural differences between the various countries.  
What they have in common, though, is that it would be very hard to find a low-qualified job without being fluent in the local language. You'd either have to talk to local customers or with colleagues as part of your job, who might not be able to speak English all that well. A simple misunderstanding can cost a business a lot of money.

Depending on what your profession is and where you went, potential employers might also not recognize your current qualifications.

So, take your time. Look into the various countries that interest you, start learning the language, and try to get some kind of professional certification that will transfer easily.  
Alternatively, research what kind of help you could expect from social programs in the country you're a national of, especially language and professional training.",0,1327271254,null,0,false,0,c3jk81f,t3_oqvut,t1_c3jk81f,t3_oqvut,null,1428221111,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; I would move to Texas or maybe the East coast because California is a nasty state period.

Truth. The stupidity of the California state government only serves to amplify the stupidity of the federal government. I've played with the idea of moving to Texas or North Carolina for a few years, and I regret not pulling the trigger when I had the means to do so.

At this point, I won't be able to afford the move nor the cost of the fallout from the move (new deposits, new registrations, etc). What makes Europe different in that regard is that I have a lot of family over there and I can bum around until I get things settled.

&gt; And by the way...if you base your choice because of health insurance...

Oh, that's not part of it at all. I've always recognized that the cost of private insurance is comparable to paying higher taxes for nationalized healthcare in European countries.

You have to be considerably ""left-wing"" and alternative to make friends or not be shunned by younger Germans (up to about age 45-50 when most of them suddenly turn very conservative, yet still not as conservative as US conservatives)

Unless you want to be considered a ""fascist US asshole"", pretend the following:

- You are against any kind of nuclear energy, and think wind energy is the way to go for every country of the globe
- You have read all of Charlotte Roche's books and think she's the both the greatest writer of contemporary Germany *and* the best looking, most interesting person in the whole country.
- Religiously read SPIEGEL ONLINE (they have an English version). It's basically a glorified yellow press product, but Germans think of it as quality journalism and get all their (very skewed) news and opinions from it.
- Never read or cite from BILD-Zeitung, which is about the same quality journalism as SPIEGEL, but gets shunned by Germans who think they're intelligent or modern.
- If you don't smoke, start to. Germans still consider smokers to be ""easy going rebels"" who will make great friends, while non-smokers are seen as stuck-up proto-fascists.
- Same goes for tattoos. Make sure to get a few, but not tribal bands or anything ""guido"". Rather go for something ironic. Germans *love* irony.
- Don't admit to ever owning a car, if you want to be accepted by younger Germans.
- Be completely crazy about cars and judge everybody solely by what car he drives, if you want to be accepted by better-off, or older Germans.
- If possible, find a room or apartment in a really old building (turn of the century, art-noveau for extra bonus). This will get you laid. Move to a ""soulless"" modern building, and be shunned or patronized.
- Don't talk about food too much. Germans see the intake of food not as fun or a treat, but as a necessity that takes up time and should be done as casually as possible. Think ""pick up a Kebab on the way home which you'll wolf down standing outside of the Turkish fast food shop"" as the most gourmet thing you'll do in Germany. The usual fare is ready-made pasta with tomato sauce (Miracoli brand) for 6 of 7 days of the week.

Bottom line, as an immigrant with imperfect language and with skills which are not closely aligned with local business, I believe it is going to be hard to find a well-paying job outside of certain industries and positions (like marketing in the semiconductor industry).  

So those are the reasons why I think that most folks who are under educated and not not fluent in a few European languages need to prepare themselves to return to university for some time to get the skills that are needed in their new place of residence.  If you have recent college experience in the U.S. it will probably transfer to most Universities in Europe... so I don't think you are looking at 6-8 years of work as I am.

Additionally the new fascination with austerity means that everyone who does not make political contributions is going to see a decrease in government services.

The signup is a simple pdf form on their website, where you fill in the usual nonsense like name address etc. The only thing extra they ask you is to write a few lines of motivation for going in French, or as close to French as you can manage.

First time you go, they make you take a kind of introductory exam, which determines the class they're going to put you into. (A1,A2,B1,B2,etc..) (I'm doing B1 atm, and I started with A2)

There are several different types of courses. I'm doing the 3 times a week course with a total of 90h (3x2h per week), and that costs 122,- EU. So that comes down to about 1,30 EU per hour. The course lasts half a year and it goes kind of by school semesters. So a February to June type thing, and a September to January course.

Additionally there are shorter 60h classes which are only half a level (A1.1, A1.2, A2.1, etc) and longer 4times a week 3h, 120h classes.

If your really interested in official certifications like DELF or DALF, which are needed if you want to study here in France, you can still do the course with the Mairie in Paris, and just take the exam at the Sorbonne,
which still ends up being way cheaper than doing the whole course there.

The signup itself doesn't cost anything, if you're accepted you bring the money the first day of class together with a passport foto for your card, and that's it.

One thing I should mention though is, that you need to be pretty quick when the signup starts, since it's a fairly popular course, and depending on the location/school where you want to go to there are only so many places and it works on a first come, first served basis.

Shame about just missing the inscription, however, they do also give an intensive summer course you could take before starting in September if that's still interesting for you.

Hope it works out for you!

&gt; The European Union ""will never block the internet"" in the name of enforcing copyright laws, said the European Commissioner of Justice, Viviane Reding. ""The protection of copyright holders should never be used as a pretext to reduce freedom on the internet,"" said Reding. She emphasized that the current question of freedom on the internet is one of ""lively debate.""

&gt; In the US, political power took one step forward and two steps back with its controversial proposed PIPA and SOPA anti-piracy laws. An unprecedented number of websites, including internet giants such as Google, Wikipedia and dozens of others shut down or otherwise openly protested the proposed laws. Around the same time, American authorities closed down Megaupload.com – an emblematic and controversial file-hosting website – citing copyright law violations. ""You will never see Europe restricting the internet, it's just not an option we'll take,"" said Reding at the Digital Life Design conference in Munich. 

&gt; ""Freedom of information is a fundamental right closely intertwined with freedom of the internet,"" said the European Commissioner. She added that ""European politics is designed to reach an equilibrium in respecting rights,"" both of content creators and internet users. A number of countries, including France, have passed legislation that permits the shutdown of certain websites. Gambling websites that do not conform to government standards on online gambling, for example, can be blocked under such laws.


&gt; **EUROPEAN LAWS ON PRIVATE INFORMATION**


&gt; Reding detailed her ideas for protecting Europeans' personal information on the internet. Her ideas, which should be published in the following several days, ""replace the patchwork of current laws with one unified European law, applying to all online enterprises – based both inside and outside of Europe – that offer their services to the public."" She also said that laws should prevent giants like Facebook or Google, for example, from collecting personal information and evading laws by storing information abroad.  European internet law reform will require users' consent in ""clear"" terms before personal data can be collected. This will include information about how data is stored and for how long. The law will ensure Europeans have the ""right to be forgotten,"" that is to say, ""the right to revoke consent they have already given.""

&gt; ""Citizens should have the right to more power, and the power to control what is put online,"" said Reding. Finally, in the case ""of loss, theft, or piracy of personal information, individuals should be quickly informed,"" and companies should be obligated to keep authorities informed of such events within 24 hours of their taking place.

In many other countries you may also have few problems, but it would be wise to take it into consideration. Regardless of country, you can always hang out with other expats should language become a barrier. Try to find work (at least initially) in a multinational company that has its official language as English.

If you also speak Canadian-French, that obviously opens up a few more countries.

Where I live in Belgium, there are an awful lot of Canadians that move here to study philosophy. Don't know if that's a particular endorsement or not. :)

Most Europeans will recognize archetypes such as the princess who falls in love with a simple commoner, or songs like ""Father Jacob"" in various languages.

I think the most striking attribute that sets Europe apart from other parts of the world is how people think, which is reflected in the structure and politics of society. A kind of ""responsible individualism"" with an inherent inclination towards democracy and fairness. While in other parts of the world you can find an apathetic tolerance of discrimination, abuse and other (in European terms) undesirable human traits, you don't get away with that as easily in Europe.

&gt; To raise your concerns on this issue, under the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure (Rule 117, 1,) I have also tabled a parliamentary question on your behalf to The European Commission regarding ACTA.

That's pretty poor. Parliamentary questions are questions from an MEP to another institution to get information or justification, not to get a policy change. That means: he's not trying.

If he wanted to do something he would (a) inform himself (b) send emails around to fellow MEPs and (c) invite civic groups to voice their concerns in a public workshop or other form of event. The main work he can do anyway is to inform his party group (not the British conservatives, but the ECR group in the parliament) or get their secretariat to prepare a report. As a shadow he is also in a position to table amendments and cooperate closely with the one writing the main report.

Also, in a way, the most useful thing to do is to check out who is writing the ACTA report for responsible committee and spam him/her with phonecalls and emails until they REALLY look into it.

Ich verwende dieses Wort aus Ermangelung eines besseren. Falls du eine gute Alternative vorschlagen kannst, dann würde ich mich freuen.

Islamisten finde ich als Wort wenig anschaulich beschreibend. Es klingt zu sehr nach ""Anhänger des Islam"". Auch sind nicht alle Islamisten oder moslemische Fundamentalisten gleich in ihrer Weltanschauung. Der Hass, die Gewalttätigkeit, Menschenverachtung, Intoleranz, Hitlerverehrung, Theokratie, Todesverehrung, Misogynie, der Antimodernismus, Antisemitismus und Antisäkularismus der gefährlichen Ausprägungen des Islamismus sind dem Faschismus nicht unähnlich. 

Ich verstehe allerdings auch die Kritik an diesem Begriff. Er kann als Islam=Faschismus falsch interpretiert werden.

Mit der christlichen Variante dieses Begriffs, [Klerikalfaschismus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klerikalfaschismus), haben die Leute komischerweise weniger Probleme.

Dear [ikkake]
 
SOPA, and PIPA that are currently being debated in the United States would effectively close down the free internet entirely, using the excuse of protecting Copyright. Nikki Sinclaire MEP does not support the American Government  making this more and more questionable move and is completely against any similar legislation in Europe.

The EU soon will be debating the ACTA Treaty which like the SOPA and PIPA threatens the exchange of knowledge and information on the Internet; in any and all circles where the information could be deemed to be someone else's 'property'. We believe itself should not exist in any form. It is a catastrophic violation of individual private property, and so we will oppose ACTA when the final bill comes up for vote in the European Parliament. These proposals only adds to the growing already very BIG list of reasons why'd we'd be better off out the EU !!
 
No-one would disagree with the need to oppose and control infringement of IP/Copyright, but ACTA is not the way to go about this.  ACTA like SOPA and PIPA criminalises the general population and strangles innovation and freedom of speech and expression.
 
Kindest Regards

Es gibt einen [Selbsttest zum Thema Antisemitismus](http://www.herrmeyer.ch/archives/239), der auf jeden Fall mal zum Nachdenken anregen sollte.

Der sogenannte [3-D Test von Natan Sharansky](http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-sharansky-s05.htm) ist relativ gut geeignet um Antisemitismus von Israelkritik anhand konkreter Kriterien zu unterscheiden. 

&gt;**Das erste „D“ ist der Dämonisierungs-Test**. Wenn der jüdische Staat dämonisiert wird, Israels Handeln ohne jedes Maß dargestellt wird, Vergleiche zwischen Israelis und Nazis und palästinensischen Flüchtlingslagern und Auschwitz gezogen werden – dann ist das Antisemitismus, keine legitime Kritik an Israel.

&gt;**Das zweite “D” ist der Test auf doppelte Standards**. Wenn Kritik selektiv auf Israel angewendet wird; wenn allein Israel von der UNO wegen Menschenrechtsverletzungen herausgestellt wird, während das Verhalten bekannter und wichtiger Verletzer wie China, Iran, Kuba und Syrien ignoriert wird; wenn Israels Magen David Adom als einziger der Ambulanzdienste der Welt die Aufnahme ins Internationale Rote Kreuz verweigert wird – dann ist das Antisemitismus.

&gt;**Das dritte „D“ ist der Delegitimierungs-Test**: Wenn Israel das fundamentale Recht auf Existenz in Abrede gestellt wird, als einzigem Volk auf der Welt, dann ist auch das Antisemitismus.

true,diespinnendoch,null,null,"Wie wäre es einfach mit 'islamische Fundamentalisten'? Es muss ja nicht immer nur ein Wort sein. Und die über einen Kamm zu scheren, finde ich jetzt nicht so schlimm, zumindest weit weniger als als eine falsche Analogie aufzumachen, denn der Islam ist nicht faschistisch.
Faschismus ist nicht theokratisch geprägt, sondern eine Staatsideologie - auch wenn viele Christen mit dem Faschismus  kooperiert haben (deshalb Klerikalfaschismus). Ich käme jetzt nicht auf die Idee die christlichen Fundamentalisten 'Christofaschisten' zu nennen, auch wenn auf die deine o.g. Aufzählung genauso zutrifft. Und auf Hindus, Sikhs, usw.

Ich zitiere für die Klickfaulen, welche Kritik an dem Wort ich teile:
&gt;Der Historiker Moshe Zuckermann kritisiert die aktuelle Verwendung. Der Islamofaschismus „ist ein hanebüchener Ausdruck.  Der islamistische Fundamentalismus hat mit Faschismus, betrachtet man die Analysen des Faschismus, die in den 60er Jahren geleistet wurden, gar nichts zu tun. Wenn wir unter Faschismus verstehen, was sich in einer bestimmten Epoche in Italien, Ungarn, Spanien, später dann als Nationalsozialismus in Deutschland in einer radikalisierten Sonderform formierte, so stellt dies etwas ganz anderes dar als die Bewegungen des radikalisierten Islam. Der Islam ist von ganz anderen Momenten angetrieben und hat ganz andere Zielsetzungen. Das hat nichts miteinander zu tun. Man muss schon den Begriff des Faschismus inhaltlich entleeren, um oberflächliche Ähnlichkeiten ausmachen zu können.“
&gt;
&gt;Er weist darauf hin, dass der Faschismus „tendenziell nicht- oder auch antireligiös“ war, während der islamische Fundamentalismus theokratisch ausgerichtet sei. Ein weiterer Widerspruch beider Ideologien sei, dass der Faschismus auf dem Primat des Staates basiere, während dies beim islamischen Fundamentalismus eine „eher untergeordnete Rolle“ spiele und weist weiter auf das Fehlen eines im Nationalsozialismus vorhandenen „monolithischen Volksgenossen“ hin und auf die mangelnde Deckungsgleichheit zwischen den Begriffen der Ummah (= Gemeinschaft) und der Volksgemeinschaft, die in faschistischen Systemen anzutreffen ist. Zuckermann ist infolge dieser Überlegungen der Meinung, dass der Begriff „Islamofaschismus“ eher polemisch als analytisch verwendet wird.
