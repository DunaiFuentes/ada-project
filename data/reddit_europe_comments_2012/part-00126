Schlink is an author, a writer, and like most writers, he just loves to generalize a bit. That's not a bad trait, though. Goethe and Schiller weren't much different in that regard, they also wrote little poems about ""we germans"", although they actually meant ""the central-european spirit"". One has to figure out for themselves which version they prefer.

Obviously, Schlink is perfectly aware that he's hugely generalizing. Or are we talking about ""creepy nationalistic language"" when american television shows talk about ""the american people""?

My major issue however is that it's another example of attempting instantaneous change to a problem that needs a long term balanced solution. 

As with education when these kind of knee jerk policies are put in place there is no thought to any final stable equality. Thanks to female orientated changes in the past 25 years the number of females leaving university is now greater than males. There are entire professions dominated by females or set to be dominated by females once the previous generation retire (e.g. practising veterinarians are expected to reach 90% female in the UK in the coming decades). This is not necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that this situation has been arranged by implementing a female dominated education system which is now biassed against young males (e.g. lack of male teachers, modular courses with no final examination, extra bursaries and sponsorship for specifically female students, setting quotas on university entrances). 

The policies that have caused females to outnumber males at university haven't stopped, they haven't been amended, and very shortly I imagine we'll be seeing people asking why young males are under-performing so badly in education.

I don't like the sound of that and neither does /r/europe from the looks of things.  In a situation where both candidates are equally qualified or in your other scenario where the woman is better qualified surely the final decision should be based on factors other than the candidates sex.

If the man is picked because he's a man then of course that's wrong but all this law would do is force a decision in favour of a female candidate based on nothing but her gender and I cannot see how that is any less unfair.  Just because women are under represented in such roles doesn't mean that the solution is to force their appointment at the expense of possibly better suited candidates.

This is just an effort at achieving a result, which it almost certainly would but would do nothing to assuage the idea that is presumably prevalent that women are less suited to directorial roles.  Changing that belief is the real solution here but obviously one that isn't as easy as casting a wand and enacting a law so as is often the case the short term 'fix' is proposed which ultimately benefits no one.

I doubt anyone in the thread disagrees that direct sexism is still real - but it is not the primary cause of pay inequality or a lack of women at the very top of business any more. A larger problem is the 'club' syndrome in the elite of businesses, people scratching each others back with contracts and board positions, a high end position will likely be filled by someone known to the company before it is made open for applications - but that is a problem  for anyone excluded from the club; whether you're male or female. A business that hires on the basis on gender is only damaging it's own competitiveness.

The reason people aren't putting forward case studies as evidence is because not everyone is a politics student; or they just can't be arsed. People come on reddit for a bit of fun when they get a few minutes, not to write essays complete with citations. 

Positive discrimination is still discrimination and it is against current equality laws except for when politicians write in exceptions for their own political gain. The best example I can think of for this is Labour's Young NEC. The East Midlands and Anglia accepted female only candidates; this excluded me for running for one reason only - I had the audacity to be born with a penis.

yup, pretty much that.

&gt; As time goes by and the current people retire and younger people take their places there will eventually be gender equality as the new generations had the same education for both men and women.

Exactly, this type of law will become unnecessary with time. Only perhaps this time could be significantly shorter if women were just forced upon even such places to leadership positions. Because chances are, not many of them are misogynist.

&gt;Only 13.7% of board members of large firms in the EU are women, up from 8.5% in 2003. Female presidents and chairwomen are even rarer: just 3.2% of the total now, compared with 1.6% in 2003. Women account for 60% of new graduates in the EU, and enter many occupations in roughly equal numbers with men. But with every step up the ladder more of them drop out, and near the top they almost disappear.

http://www.economist.com/node/21549953

Notice the article is not for them at all, for obvious economic costs of pushing currently less qualified women suddenly into leadership positions.

But like you, admits that pure and simple sexism is the cause of the current situation, and that there is otherwise a good economic case for more women in leadership. 

Well, since sexual discrimination is actually illegal in all EU countries, I really don't see why women should have to wait for changes of generation, being discriminated all that time, rather than just pushed into a fairer balance by simple legal action, albeit at an initial economic cost. And at least as a credible threat if the firms don't commit and act on the matter themselves.

&gt; Oh, and ""positive"" discrimination is still discrimination and only serves to further the stereotypes.

Perhaps. But it also puts them in certain power, installs by decree a less biased committee and gives them more hope for a high position in their career which might be motivating to push towards the top themselves.

In any case, I don't agree with such an ambitious target as 40%, not over an overly short period, and probably not because I'd expect simply more deviations on both sides on a small commitee just by a gaussian distribution. 

And surely any action a firm willingly takes on the matter is worth more than what a government might achieve . But threat of the latter unless ..., might make the former happen.

&gt; What's next, you want to increase the price of condoms 10 times for whites and make them free for blacks so that you make the AIDS rate similar regardless of ethnicity?

You mean, across continents, or within a country? I don't see anything wrong in giving out free condoms (payed by the taxpayers) in poor neighborhoods where the incident rate of sexual diseases is higher. 

But I couldn't imagine intercontinental legislation including a significant monetary transfer across continents is anywhere near 'next'.

In any case, unless you consider poverty a form of discrimination itself (arguable position, I wouldn't agree with it fully), and if merely the price of condoms is the obstacle making the incident rate higher in some black communities, then AIDS rate is dissimilar across ethnicities not due to discrimination, but due to poverty.

DNRW: The old women want to control every part of your life and you are constantly told what do do, what to wear, heavy social control and rules on every level.  People are somewhat reserved and have trouble dealing with freedom.

STM: People will pretty much leave you alone but they want to know your ideology so they can type you.  Some people are really bizarre and strange.  No, most people are really bizarre and strange.

STM: Many men are into the outdoors thing, fishing, hunting, motorcycling

DNRW: Common activities are sitting at the bar, watching tv, arguing (discussing), maybe some people have hobbies which they are totally obsessed with

STM: Laws are meant for the big city, nobody follows them or thinks they apply to people in a small town.

DNRW: Rules rule, order must rule! Rules are rigidly applied, no matter how stupid they are.

STM: There are many opportunities for people to get into self destructive lifestyles (drugs, crime, gangs) and many people do get caught in them.

Some stats from the [European Parliament](http://www.theparliament.com/latest-news/article/newsarticle/eu-commission-told-to-propose-binding-gender-quota-laws/#.UFe1ws3oxNw):
  

Women currently represent 60 per cent of the holders of academic degrees in the EU, but they constitute only 13.7 per cent   
of board members at Europe's top firms. It is estimated that at current rates, it would take more than 40 years to reach a ""significant"" gender balance, that is, at least 40 per cent of both sexes on company boards.  
  
The proposed legislative action by EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding, came about because her calls to take voluntary steps to increase the number of women on boards to 40% by 2020 failed to deliver tangible results.

&gt;Applying quotas only to women is very short sighted.  

The draft directive states that, ""Progress in the share of women on company boards is very slow, with an average annual increase of just 0.6 percentage points over the past years,”  

Yes, they might have to rethink this in a few hundred years.

On est très, très, très loin d'une convergence fiscale avec l'Allemagne. Voire même au sein même des territoires français. 
Et cela implique bien entendu : une perte totale d'autonomie des États. Et des territoires internes à ces États. A quoi servirait l'élection d'un élu local ? A rien, quasiment. National ? A rien, quasiment. A la marge, les questions de mœurs, hein. Et les politiques économiques ne pourront être adaptées selon les territoires, les difficultés ou facilités locales, etc.

Pour les Fonds Européens, il s'agit uniquement de fonds permettant d'investir. C'est du ""bonus"", et de la redistribution à la marge. C'est très chouette, hein. Par contre, c'est clairement illisible et très loin d'être démocratique.

Disons que ton point de vue n'est pas qu'utopique. Soit il est aussi naïf, soit il prend parti d'un système ultra-technocratique, sans quasiment aucun regard pour le citoyen local. Et pas ""local"", j'entends l'ensemble de tous les échelons de l'Etat jusqu'à la petite commune de 200 habitants qui ne comprendra peut-être pas pourquoi elle ne pourrait pas fixer ses taxes locales, ou mener une politique comme elle le souhaite.

L'idée de l'UE, c'est justement de laisser une marge de manœuvre d'un pays à l'autre, tout en mettant en commun tout ce qui peut l'être sans trop de souci. C'est aussi le principe d'un Etat, hein, ou d'une nation plus grande (genre fédération). Par exemple : une armée commune, une seule langue donc un système éducatif commun, un ensemble de lois, et un système judiciaire, etc.

Là, tu proposes d'appliquer ça sans nuance de ""localité"" à l'échelle du monde. Ben non, on est même pas dans l'utopie, là. Parce que même un Etat n'y arrive pas, à ça, au-dessus d'une certaine taille. Si tu veux penser en termes d'utopie, demande-toi justement les implications (même utopiques, théoriques) d'un tel système.

Si tu mets tout cela en branle uniquement pour éviter l'évasion fiscale, d'ailleurs, ça ne serait pas trop pratique.

Take a look here:
http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=t2020_41

Now if we look at females achieving tertiary education we see a rise from 22.7 to 38.5 in the years 2000 - 2011 (I'm using the whole EU figure here). Male achievment in the same time goes from 22.2 to 30.8. It is clear that male tertiary education achievement is improving at a lower rate than females. The stats provided are for people in the 30-34 age group so the 2000 batch would be in the 42-46 range today. It is reasonable to assume that due to various factors depressing female education before that time that the percentage of females completing university prior to 2000 would have been lower. It is also reasonable to assume that the distribution of degree type being taken by those females would have been different as well. Changes in education have, quite rightly, increased the number of females going to university and broadened the range of degrees being taken by them. However before those changes were in place, and I wish the stats went back another 10 years to help my case, it was a very different story.

So we come to the question at hand. The jobs in contention (e.g. directors, judges, etc) are those occupied by people of late middle age (e.g. the youngest director for the company I work at was born in 1966). These EU policymakers are attempting to apply the distribution of current graduates to the jobs occupied by people who graduated under an entirely different distribution of achievement. I'm not suprised that the share of women on company boards hasn't shifted much in the past few years. When we look at company directors we are, in the main, looking 20 - 30 years in the past. Once we catch up to the point where female education achievement matched male educational achievement we will see a large swing in composition of the graduate labour force.

Based on the stats I'd expect to see that swing happening in the next 10 years. However, 10 years after that we're looking at another imbalance but with males being the minority and that future imbalance looks as though it is going to continue getting worse (female education results keep on improving more than males).

That's why I'm saying it is shortsighted to only legislate 40% females. If there is to be quota legislation in place then it needs to address the future imbalance as well.

EDIT: Managed to dig down a bit further (Eurostat is fun to play with).

I've almost never heard such an accusation being tossed around here, and here's why. 

First off, questionnaires to some of the respective companies, after the quota was established, reveals that the females they have hired are just as competent and qualified as the previous males. 

Second off, statistics in Norway has shown that the females which got hired after the quota has been both younger, and more educated than the established older males. This has balanced the composition in several ways, contributing both to the increased power of the younger demograpic, and their education has increased professionalism and made the work more formal in the respective companies. 

The quota was established in 2008, and naturally is difficult to measure increase/decrease in profits, so hard numbers lack. But then we have to listen to the respective companies, and they are now almost all in favor of it, so my guess is that they have increased their competetiveness and/or profits.

Quotas are simply a way of introducing different ingridients to create a better soup. But the female-male synergy is older than, and transcends ideas like racism and sexism. Therefore I'd argue sex-quotas differ from racial quotas and other quotas. And if this consistently improves the honor and judgement of companies and states, then why not. It'll give us more competetiveness *and* equality at the same time.",0,1347937639,null,0,false,0,c69qcdf,t3_100mj1,t1_c69qcdf,t1_c69e6tz,null,1429926027,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

We are paying way more than solidarity might ask for.

In fact, if Catalonia needs a bailout, it's because it loses a 10% of its GDP to Spain.

Imagine: Before taxes you earn 110 and your poor neighbour earns 90. After paying and redistributing taxes you get 99 and your neighbour 101. Why would ever in the world your neighbour want to work harder if this way he already gets more than you????

And now, on top of this, you get that the central state does not defend your culture. For example, Maltese is official in the EU but Catalan, spoken by millions more people, is not, because Spain doesn't want it to be.

**If this is your idea of a federal European state, of course there would be less than stellar results** It's too easy to speak without knowing the real facts.

&gt;Soulevant, balançant le feston et l'ourlet;



&gt;Agile et noble, avec sa jambe de statue.

&gt;Moi, je buvais, crispé comme un extravagant,

&gt;Dans son oeil, ciel livide où germe l'ouragan,

&gt;La douceur qui fascine et le plaisir qui tue.

Another from Verlaine:

&gt;Voici des fruits, des fleurs, des feuilles et des branches

&gt;Et puis voici mon coeur qui ne bat que pour vous.

&gt;Ne le déchirez pas avec vos deux mains blanches

&gt;Et qu'à vos yeux si beaux l'humble présent soit doux.



&gt;J'arrive tout couvert encore de rosée

&gt;Que le vent du matin vient glacer à mon front.

&gt;Souffrez que ma fatigue à vos pieds reposée

Personal favorite, el Desdichado by Gerard de Nerval:

&gt;Rends-moi le Pausilippe et la mer d’Italie,

Austria is full of people who just like having a little prestige. Titles, functions etc. . They have a ""function"" and are happy about it. This leads to people high up to do nothing.

They are just ""happy"" to be the chief of a certain club and really end up doing nothing while they are there. Problem is that they are just too many of them. The result is funding across the board for everyone, but no special treatment for our top athletes. This results in our top atheletes to slip behind everyone elses top athletes, thus resulting in no medals for us.

I agree with you that what you described is a problem in our media. I looked at the riots in China over these new Japanese islands, and at the inability of the police forces to do much when *one of their own* was attacked by the protestors. There were simply too many people. I had sympathy for the Chinese (or mostly 'East Asian') way of putting stability and economic growth first, freedom later, due to some of their bloody revolts in the past. But this really put it into a modern spotlight, and it makes the caution of the Chinese leadership very much understandable.

I am not only British, I am also German. If there is one people who doesn't like being in charge, it's us. Maybe our politicians aren't, but whenever I talk to somebody about this issue, they'd be happy if we weren't in the position we are right now. Everybody expects some kind of miracle-leadership from Germany, and it's just not going to happen. In my view, nobody has a clue what's going on right now and since just doing what you always do is no different from doing nothing, you just carry on. Personally, I agree that no one country should be too powerful in a hypothetical European state, for the exact same reasons you have given.

At last, feel free to treat the idiot Neonazis to your own thoughts about the issue. They're just losers without a future who can't get a job or get laid and try to make others responsible for that.

PRC is very diversed country, it has got a lot of minorities that aren't pleased with current domination of the Han culture.

My heritage is also quite diverse - my ancestors were not only Polish but also Czech, German and Hungarian.

I see that you are worried that this law might result in men in EU countries being discriminated against. Dont' worry. Even if the law's aim, at present, is to get more women on boards, the long term aim is gender equality. You see, the draft legislation speaks of “specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex”. *Underrepresented sex* not just women or men. See the difference?  Had you read the draft legislation, you would have known this.

Anyway, let me give you a link to   
[Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
on improving the gender balance among non-executive directors of companies listed on stock exchanges.   
](http://blogs.r.ftdata.co.uk/brusselsblog/files/2012/09/ISC-draft-Directive-2.pdf)
And here are some excerpts from it:  


“The core of the problem lies in [ ] The lacking readiness of companies to appoint female candidates to board  
 positions is rooted in gender stereotypes in recruitment and promotion, a male-dominated business culture and  
 the lack of transparency in board appointment processes. These elements, [ ] undermine the optimal  
 functioning of the labour market for top management positions throughout the EU.  

The purpose of the proposal is to [..] set[ting] a binding minimum objective of 40% presence of the under-  
represented sex among non-executive directors of companies listed on stock exchanges.  



The proposed objective of 40% for the minimum share of both sexes is in line with the targets currently under  
discussion and set in a number of EU Member States/EEA countries. It is situated between the minimum of the  
 'critical mass' of 30% found to be necessary to have a sustainable impact on board performance and full gender  
 parity (50%).  


The Charter in principle prohibits any discrimination based on sex in its Article 21(1), but also recognizes in Article 23 that the principle of equality does not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex.

The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has established the criteria that need to be met in order to   
reconcile the two concepts of formal equality of treatment and positive action aiming to bring about de facto  
 equality, both of which are recognized in the Charter as well as in Article 157 TFEU and in Article 3 of Directive  
 2006/54/EC.  

These requirements are that:  

(1)	The measures must concern a sector in which women are under-represented.  

(2)	They can only give priority to equally qualified female candidates over male candidates.  

(3)	They must not give automatic and unconditional priority to equally qualified candidates, but must include a  
 ""saving clause"" which includes the possibility of granting exceptions in justified cases which take into account  
 the individual situation, notably the personal situation of each candidate.

I see that this discussion is still ongoing, and still comments reflect ignorance of the proposed law.  
 
Some seem to think that this law, if enacted, would result in women, undeservedly, grabbing power in companies all over the EU.  

Perhaps you are are right, maybe women are on their way to taking over the world. I doubt that, though.  Not in our lifetime anyway.  Many of you are worried that the end result of this law would be that men in EU countries would be discriminated against.  
  
   
Then again, some of you are just plain old ignorant misogynists, talking out of your arses.   
   
Had you actually read the proposed draft, you would have known that, even if the laws aim, at present, is to get more women on boards, the long term aim is gender equality.  You see, the draft legislation speaks of “specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex”.   
  
""Underrepresented sex"" not just women, or men. See the difference?   

 

Anyway, let me provide you with a link to  
    

 [Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on improving the gender balance among non-executive directors of companies listed on stock exchanges.  
](http://blogs.r.ftdata.co.uk/brusselsblog/files/2012/09/ISC-draft-Directive-2.pdf)  


And, for the lazy, here are some excerpts from it:  


“The core of the problem lies in [ ] The lacking readiness of companies to appoint female candidates to board positions is rooted in gender stereotypes in recruitment and promotion, a male-dominated business culture and  
 the lack of transparency in board appointment processes.  These elements, [ ] undermine the optimal  
 functioning of the labour market for top management positions throughout the EU.  

  

The purpose of the proposal is to [..] set[ting] a binding minimum objective of 40% presence of the under-represented sex among non-executive directors of companies listed on stock exchanges.    
 
  


The proposed objective of 40% for the minimum share of both sexes is in line with the targets currently under  
 discussion and set in a number of EU Member States/EEA countries. It is situated between the minimum of the  
 'critical mass' of 30% found to be necessary to have a sustainable impact on board performance and full gender    parity (50%).  
  



The Charter in principle prohibits any discrimination based on sex in its Article 21(1), but also recognizes in   
Article 23 that the principle of equality does not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for  
 specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex.  
  
 

The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has established the criteria that need to be met in order to  
 reconcile the two concepts of formal equality of treatment and positive action aiming to bring about de facto  
 equality, both of which are recognized in the Charter as well as in Article 157 TFEU   
and in Article 3 of Directive 2006/54/EC.   
 


**These requirements are** that:  

**(1)**	The measures must concern a sector in which women are under-represented.   
 

**(2)**	They can only give priority to equally qualified female candidates over male candidates.   
 

**(3)**	They must not give automatic and unconditional priority to equally qualified candidates, but must include a ""saving clause"" which includes the possibility of granting exceptions in justified cases which take into account   
the individual situation, notably the personal situation of each candidate.

Your response is incredibly telling.    
You do realize that tech startups are typically **founded** not joined. The culture is exactly what you make of it. Hell, start it up in the right jurisdiction and you can fire anyone who mentions sex or doesn't wear hijab.

The reason start-up culture is dominated by alpha males (with the side-effects thereof) is because *they found companies*. The problem isn't with their behavior, which obviously results in some amazing progress for humanity, but in the fact that for some reason women (and ""beta"" male) don't found companies.

I would personally suspect the dislike of rejection that women tend to have (men get trained in accepting rejection during their teenage years quite thoroughly by women), the significant dislike of uncertainty (startups are nothing if not uncertain) and the conscious and quite sensible concern that there might be a need at some point to jump out of the company for 4-6 months or more (kids).

First of all you are mixing up different entities such as the County of Barcelona and the Crown of Aragon before and after the dinastical union with Castille.

The County of Catalonia has a very short story, being born as a Caroligian protectorate to stop the muslim advance, The County was established in the 9th Century and gained certain autonomy in the 10th Century. It thrived and gained power through the integration with other catalan counties during the 11th Century. The Counts of Barcelona acquired other entities through marriage but also through force, subjecting rebellious counts (those oppressive fascists!). However, in the 12th Century, the County was absorbed by the Kingdom of Aragon, giving birth to the Crown of Aragon. From then on, the Count of Barcelona was simply one more among the collection of titles of the King of Aragon.

Many modern nations were formed by the asimilation of smaller political entities into bigger ones, sometimes through force. Very often, it was simply the different nobles and aristocrats playing their game and marrying off their children to become bigger and more important than other growing European nations. The Count of Barcelona married the daughter of the King of Aragon to become more powerful, he didn't give a shit about culture and language. Ferdinand of Aragon married Isabella of Castille so both would become more powerful. Yes, Castille and Aragon were different kingdoms until 1714, but the unification process started with Charles I and they were ruled by the same king. The supression of the Crown of Aragon by Philip V was yet another move in the European power chess game after the death of Charles II and has nothing to do with the Castilian boogeyman that wants to destroy the irreductible Catalonians and their culture. Heck, the Kingdom of Leon officially existed until 1833. That happened all the time in those years, territory X rebels against the King or supports another candidate and they lose: as a consequence they are stripped of special privilege Y.

Yes, it is a fact that the Bourbon Dinasty pushed an absolutist and centralist ideal of the nation, and there have been cultural and linguistical assimilation politics of different strength and importance in Spain. However, I think that the glorious legend of Catalonia as an independent Kingdom conquered by the Castillian tyrants is a partially fabricated myth or, at least, a certainly biased interpretation of history. Medieval History of Spain is a madhouse, *una casa de putas*,  where all the political entities were fighting and joining all the time. Selectively picking some bits that adjust to your romantic contemporary vision of nation makes no sense. The integration of Catalonia and later Aragon into what today is Spain was part of the power game of aristocrats, a game in which all parts were equal and willing and didn't care about culture, identity or the common people.",0,1347964388,null,0,1347964689,0,c69ux69,t3_101frj,t1_c69ux69,t1_c69trnn,null,1429928246,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

&gt;Care to point out this bigotry you're so obsessed with? Apart from your comment that distinguished between European Muslims and bigots as if it were the case that European Muslims could not be bigots...which is simply bigotry. 

I linked to it in the very first line of the self-post which began the thread, and it's really rather clear. [Here it is again for you](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/zcm4u/islam_in_europe_a_real_problem_the_debate_about/c63ixlz), but I'm astonished that anyone with as little initiative as you have isn't classified as clinically brain-dead.

Do you contest any of these things? Let's assume you don't. So you're left to argue against the claim that it has no place in Western society.

Your comment described perfectly the Egyptian new government, as they called for war and Jihad as of creation and they are also right wing.

And you agreed with the first comment that it will not use that in war, so that is the base of the question.

&gt;Let's look at the facts. The lack of a federation in the European Union did not contribute to the crisis in Greece: it was easy money. Interest rates declined in countries that have little [financial] credibility.”


This is a very astute point. The EU gave Greece the oppurtunity to increase it's growth by giving it increased financial credibility. What did it do with this oppurtunity? It greedily gobbled itself into the ground by using its ""sovereign right"" to make its own decision to spend far more than it possibly should have. (Of course, I refer to corrupt Greek businessmand and to some degree the Greek government. I truly feel for the Greek populace)

&gt;The introduction of the euro [single currency] was accompanied by the introduction of the Growth and Stability Pact, which required that deficits in the eurozone should not exceed 3 percent. But [the breaking of this treaty] was tolerated


Excellent point. It's not the rules themselves that are the problem, but the fact that member states break those rules. Sounds like something a stricter fiscal union might solve...

&gt;Some European economies are doing quite well, because of they are enacting better economic policy


That is exactly correct. Wouldn't it be smart if, via a stricter fiscal union, some of those ""better economic policies"" were applied to member-states which currently had/have shitty economic policies (i.e. Greece)?

Good article though. My question to the Poles out there. I see that Poland is pretty anti-federalism. Is this because of the feeling that Poland has fought long and hard to have it's own state and culture and it'll be damned if it will just hand over it's hard-earned sovereignty to some supranational orginization?

    Me revint une phrase oubliée et banale,
    Et je restai cloué, me répétant trés-pâle :
    « Chaque jour qui s'écoule est un pas vers la Mort! »

    Chaque jour est un pas! C'est vrai, pourtant! Folie!
    Et nous allons sans voir, gaspillant notre vie,
    Nous rapprochant toujours cependant du grand trou!

    Et nous « tuons le temps! » et si dans cette foule
    J'avais alors hurlé : chaque jour qui s'écoule
    Est un pas vers la Mort! on m'eût pris pour un fou.

No it doesn't. As I already said this works both ways. One of my male friends got into nursing school because of the quotas. 

Women *and* men (mostly women because of traditional work patterns) get a one-time trade-off to equalize power between the two sexes. As I already said it wasn't because women were not qualified or competent enough that they didn't get the jobs pre-quota. It also doesn't matter which sex that get's the most out of the quotas, they are supposed to equalize power.

&gt;Also this isnt a viewpoint that's statistically surveyed 

Exactly. Know that the burden of proof lay on you then, not me. 

&gt;maybe you don't hear this in lala-land norway but, then again, you probably aren't norwegian

I just painstakingly explained *why* I don't hear about this in Norway anymore, because I did in fact hear the exact same prejudices before the quota was established in Norway. 

&gt;but people often grumble about those who get promoted based on identity alone.

Everybody gets both hired and promoted mostly because of their identity. Did you mean their sex?

Islam is not the ""sole"" reason why stuff is bad and backwards in the Mideast. Yea, they are totally wrong about so much stuff. And I hate it. But Islam is just an excuse for being wrong. Just like any religion can be an excuse for being right.

&gt; We still have parents in the east who refuse to send their kids to school, forced marriages, honor killings. Those are ironically problems that only occur in the conservative provinces of the country. 

If you look at the example of India, you will find that most Hindu and Muslim families living in backwater places are equally conservative. It's about the culture, environment and historical backgroud. And Islam is surely part of that background. But not the sole ""reason"". Just like Christianity is not solely to blame for the crusades or the Holocaust, even though Christians were involved in both events. Or because Christianity provided the backdrop for those. We don't need religion to be idiots.

Since Islam is the cultural background, immigrants tend to double down on it, because they try to hold on to ""their"" old culture, when coming to a new country. It's an identity thing.

**German Muslim associations divided over potential ban**

**The planned presentation of the Islam-hostile movie ""Innocence of the Muslims"" is still a controversial topic - within politics as well as within the Islamic groups. The resistance against demagoguery stands against the fear of tabooing.**

Muslim-associations are divided in the question about a presentation ban of the Islam abusive video from the US. The coordination counselor of the Muslims in Germany (Koordinationsrat, KRM) and the central Muslim council are for a ban, the Liberal-Islamic association rejects such measures.

""It's a profound insult"", says KRM speaker Ali Kizilkaya to the Berlin based newspaper ""taz"" on Tuesday. This can't be covered under free speech. Aiman Mazyek from the central Muslim council also speaks out for a ban: ""I thank that all legal measures should be maxed out to reach a ban of any presentation"", he told the newspaper. The criminal act of demagoguery should be considered.

**Liberal Muslims against tabooing**

The chairman of the Liberal-Islamic association, Lamya Kaddor, spoke out against a presentation ban: ""The more you talk about a ban and push for the tabooing of such content, the more harm is done"", she warns. Discussions about bans or special laws for Muslims would further increase the Islam hostility within Germany.

The US made video caused outrage and bloody quarrels within the Arabic world. Policitians also fear about unrest in Germany and want to prevent a public showing in Berlin, which is planned by the right-wing populist splinter party Pro Deutschland. 

**Friedrich wants to prevent the showing**

Germany's interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich (CSU) pleads to stop the showing of that movie with all possible legal measures. ""The video itself shouldn't be banned because of the freedom of speech and art"", he says in Bonn.  But it would be different to show that video in a cinema in Berlin ""This can't be in our interest"". Speaking of the current security situation the minister said that there are no specific clues pointing to a threat. 

Also Leutheusser-Scharrenberger (FDP) spoke out to examine the possibility of a ban on Tuesday. She demands that Pro Deutschland should put the video on their website and drop any further plans for a public presentation.

There have been some calls against this from within the opposition. ""A foreign political consideration isn't enough to cut down the civil rights"", says SPD interior export Dieter Wiefelspütz to taz. Bans should always be the last measure. Green Party CEO Volker Becks also says no grounds for a band. The movie is a ""trashy video"", but the presentation is covered by the freedom of speech and freedom of assembly""

Iran and Syria are in counteraction supporting the PKK again, with huge causalities among civilians and the military.

I personally support a Kurdish state whether its North-Iraq or Syria, but not Turkey. 

North-Iraq is de facto the first Kurdish country and heavily depended from Turkey, because its Sunni and Kurdish (the central government in Iraq is shia and so is Iran) and also because it wants to separate from Iraq, it has not many friends and Turkey is ironically the only player in the region supporting them. The economy is dominated by Turkish corporations, there is a huge demand for Turkish schools, they sell oil directly to us, they want to build a pipeline through our soil because if the central government one day decides to cut the pipelines the KRG will have nothing.

true,Snoron,EURO,"Sandy Lane, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, UK, EU, Earth","I believe you can actually pinpoint what is specifically non-progressive about some of Islamic practise quite easily, as it's similar to what holy_maccaroni said. This is my best attempt at an objective view of the situation:

Due to the mainstream of Christianity basically not being Bible literalists, it's extremely easy for most people to ignore parts of the Bible.

With Islam, even non-fundamentalists hold that everything in the Koran is *literally* true. There's no imperfection, no doubt, nothing *too* open for interpretation (beyond the literal variances), and most of all it is all 100% true and 100% directly the word of God. The *majority* of Muslims hold this view, even the progressive ones who would never condone extremism in a million years! I assert that this is a problem in itself.

Now some issues you get from this: When someone carries out an act in the name of Islam due to some terrible shit (by modern standards) that it says in a millenia old book, they feel they have a billion people behind them. They don't. They're deluded in thinking they have such widespread support. The *problem* is that they think they have much wider support than they do, because no muslim will stand up and say ""Actually, that part of the Koran is wrong.. we shouldn't do that.. that isn't islamic, that isn't what a muslim should do"". Even if they don't agree with it, even if they don't really believe it's the right thing to do, it is *extremely difficult* to get any muslim to utter a single word like this... nowhere even close. The majority will not even give the slightest bit beyond saying the action was bad - but saying the text that was the source of the action was bad - near impossible!

Now back to Christianity... except for a few such at Jehova's Witnesses and other backwards idiots, most Christians these days don't take the Bible literally. It's hard anyway with the incongruity between the Old and New Testaments (but those Jehova's sure give it their best shot!!), but the thing is that most church-going Christians will happily say ""you know what, that part that says I should stone my daughter to death is wrong.. we shouldn't follow it"", and maybe use the old 'out' where you say ""well it was inspired by God, and at the time, in that culture, etc. but isn't all the direct word of God, so it's not infallible, etc.

The issue is that most of Islam believes Mohammed was the final prophet and that the Koran is the ultimate final word that can never be changed. There *are* sects of Islam (and Baha'i) who allow progressive prophecies and evolution of the Koran, but neither Shia or Sunni allow this.

So what does this situation with Christianity mean in every day practise? It means that if someone commits an atrocious act in the name of Christianity, they don't even mistakenly feel any support from Christians for it. There is simply not a social construct in place that allows someone to become radicalised by the Bible while surrounded by the typical western practising Christians.

If you don't believe me, go ask some Muslims and Christians. Pick some at random. Islam has the misfortune that there is no mainstream speaking-out against the source and justification of a lot of the extremism based on their holy book. Just speaking out against the atrocious acts isn't good enough because the construct that allows support is still *alive* today.

The parts of the Bible that would allow such radicalism are in mainstream Christianity as dead as the old Egyptian scrolls, they are just a piece of history. Folklore, even. Islamic culture has kept those parts alive.

*That*, in my opinion, is what is holding Islam back from better/faster/successful progress into the modern world. Not that it isn't moving at all - though sometimes you might get the feeling that everyone else is progressing away faster than that can catch up anyway, and it's not surprising.

So to address what you said too: Yes, Christians and Christianity was responsible for a lot of shit too. But see in the Crusades you could just pull the old ""it is written - it is the will of God - you can't speak out against the Bible"" shit and next thing you know you're crusading off killing millions of people. You can't do that with Christianity any more. Well guess what, with Islam you can still pull that shit off today - it's not that people will agree and say ""yes, to war!"" - it's that no one will say ""hey, fuck that part of the text"". And *that* is what needs to change. Keep the religion, that's fine, but that ultimate 100%-final-ultimate-truth-from-God respect for a book with some fucked up shit in it needs to change.

And now this might be a little stretch beyond what most people are comfortable with (if I didn't get that far already :P). But while I have no specific issue with Islam or even religion in general, I do have an issue with the actions of individuals on a person by person basis. And I would assert that everyone who isn't willing to speak out and even just ever so slightly (as it takes baby steps for this stuff) to soften the rhetoric around their regard for the infallibility of every letter in the Koran is slightly responsible for the culture that surrounds it. Things done in the name of the religion and the religious texts, just as was true with Christianity for so long is only possible while people keep up the surrounding culture that makes progress so difficult.

Okay, that's enough wall of text :D And Please be constructive if you reply, this isn't a message of hate but just what I've basically witnessed in attitudes. And I don't claim the above to be absolute truth but my take on the situation from what I've learned.

Once this 40% has been achieved and penalties avoided candidates are drawn equally. The candidate pool at present is heavily weighted in favour of males because of the education/career opportunities available to females 30 years ago. If you look even 10 or 15 years ago the female graduate population is the same size as the males and had appropriate legislation in place to pursue the same careers as their male counterparts unhindered (not perfectly so, but certainly far more than the past). That means that in 10 years or so the candidate pool will have a nearly equal male:female composition and I would expect the board composition to change accordingly.

The stats we need, the ones that will show the real state of discrimination is the male:female ratio of business people with equivalent years of experience and age range as the current boards.

No, that's not it either. As I already pointed out the widespread use of the ""phobia"" ending dates back to the early 1800s. So unless you were born and lived in the 18th century but then something happened and you woke up a few days ago don't use ""now"" like that.

&gt;Five of the six biggest countries in the EU, excluding Britain, have called for a radical overhaul of European foreign and defence policies to create a powerful new pan-**European foreign ministry**, majority voting on common foreign policies to bypass a British veto, a **possible European army**, and a single market for EU defence industries.

&gt;The German-led push, supported by 11 of 27 EU countries, embraces recent calls in Berlin and Brussels for a directly elected European president, sweeping new powers for the European parliament, and further splitting of the EU by creating a new **parliamentary sub-chamber for the 17 countries of the eurozone**.

-

&gt;""Aim for a European defence policy with joint efforts regarding the defence industry (eg the creation of a single market for armament projects); for some members of the group this could eventually involve a European army.""

&gt;The backers include Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Poland, five of the six biggest EU countries omitting Britain. The Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Austria, Portugal and Luxembourg also signed up.

&gt;The recommendations include more incendiary steps, including **a proposal to re-open and change European treaties by majority voting** because getting consensus in a union of 27 or 28 has become too slow, acrimonious and unwieldy.

&gt; Personnellement cette baisse est loin de m'alarmer, au contraire.
J'ai toujours été contre la scolarisation des enfants de 2 ans et n'ai pas changé d'avis, je suis pour qu'on les laisse vivre une vie de bébé, dans un endroit adapté à leurs besoins ; ah mais bien sûr le taux d'adultes pour encadrer ces petits de 2 à 3 ans est plus élevé dans les structures de type crèche et ça coûte cher.
Quatre ans d'école maternelle c'est énorme !
En l'an 2000 on a bien poussé les parents à scolariser leurs enfants, et c'est bien passé à l'époque, mais peut-être  les parents se sont-ils rendus compte de ce que c'est que le ryhtme et l'encadrement à l'école...
Non vraiment ça ne m'inquiète pas.
Le titre me paraît sans commune mesure avec le propos, ce n'est quand même pas sur ce seul taux qu'on peut juger l'école maternelle ""à la dérive"". Et l'on ne peut pas comparer avec les années 1960, pas le même monde ni les mêmes besoins.

Turkey's accession is an interesting, unfortunate case, because both sides have done what you'd expect them to do. I don't think it is racism or xenophobia, so much as a reasonable recognition that there are differences in culture, and economic disparities, which are made more important by the big and growing Turkish population (by 2050 you guys are projected to top 100 million, and Germany shrunk to 70 million). The countries who are keen on a looser, more heterogenous Europe are pro-Turkish accession, and the countries that want to maintain a smaller, core group, which can become a centralized federal state, are against. You've been a victim of internal politics. I'm in favour myself, but I can understand why Germany and France oppose. On the other hand, it's perfectly reasonable that Turkish people aren't willing to hang around in this way. Although I still think that things can swing both ways, depending on whether Europe becomes federal, or steps back, and what happens in the Arab world.

I have never, ever said that, I don't even think that. I just think is wrong to go forward when a lot of the countries have demonstrated their disdain for treaties, laws, rules and regulation. And, nothing has come of it. Why haven't the European Comission dealt with this? The European Parlament? Why is nobody responsible? I think going forward, when the most of the countries, and frankly everyone in charge in the EU (EP, EC etc) simply ignores things that are very, very important, is wrong. And yes, laws, treateis, regulation etc might be boring, but the current state of the Eurozone demonstrates why is it so important to follow them. I think it is enormously scary that no one reacts, and it saddens me that nobody cares or deems it important. That also confirms my belief that one can't work closer as long as people/countries behave this way.

Catalonia was not just one title of the King, the Crown was effectively run by three separate kingdoms with their three respective Estates-General and their three Generalitats. A clear example of such behavior is the meeting of nine negotiators (3 Aragonese, 3 Catalan and 3 Valencian) to choose a new king in the Compromise of Caspe. After the union with Castile, the king still needed the support of the Catalan institutions to govern Catalonia this is what viktorbir is mentioning and I think that justifies the notion that Catalonia was independent until 1714.

true,NihilCredo,EURO,European Union,"That's basically the issue we've had with monetary policy - the whole Union being forced into policies that benefited German-type industrial economies - but I don't think the same concern applies to foreign relations as it does to internal affairs.

Why? Because external negotiations will have all the EU countries, great and small, on the same side of the table, as opposed to internal decisions where they're splitting the cake amongst themselves. So the concern becomes 'the big powers won't do *enough* for the small ones' rather than 'the big powers will eat the small ones'. A Dutch or German EU foreign ministry may not fight for Portuguese olive oil as hard as the Portuguese government would have - but one word of pressure from the EU is worth *fifty* words from Portugal. As long as the new FM's attitude towards smaller member countries isn't an outright ""let's actively screw them over"", even a ""eh, they're a low priority"" would probably be an upgrade for them.

(Also consider the increased resilience to divide-and-conquer tactics. Brazil or China have some juicy products to sell, they can't get the various EU countries to try and outbid each other, they have to strike a deal with the whole EU or they lose 25% of the global market. Or for a more dramatic example, imagine Bush in 2003 having to convince a single EU ministry to get on the Iraq War, instead of being able to ignore the majority of the Union and individually picking up England, Spain, Italy and Poland.)",0,1347995907,null,0,false,0,c6a1cf5,t3_1035iu,t1_c6a1cf5,t1_c6a0p6j,null,1429931350,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

In case of Finland we are politically and economically deeply linked and allied with the European Union - our fortunes go together. While we aren't formally militarily allied with the union, in practise Finnish interests would be to defend and help out other union countries in need.

Now the reason why Finland isn't in the NATO is not because Russia doesn't want it, but because NATO is largely US lead organization that is currently searching for a new task. If we would join the NATO, then we would more or less be obliged to join up US lead projects like the Iraq war, and as we are rich and prosperous country with Russia as our neighbour, I don't think that we could just send a token of a force, but would really need to contribute. 

Another reason why Finland hasn't joined NATO is because common European defence arrangement is around the corner, maybe a decade or two away, maybe less. We already have made the big step to have a common money in the union, and to that it is much smaller step to have a common defence. While this might sound little bit backwards, the thing is that money is the most important thing in the world, and when nations make an arrangement and share a common currency, everything else is just matter of arrangement.

But if we go back to Russia. The problem with Russia is that they are a paranoid empire, holding tightly to few last possessions that they have, and seeing enemies everywhere. In this context joining the NATO would aggregate Russia as they are still largely in the cold war mindset where US is their adversary. However Europe to Russians is not seen as similarly as a threat, quite contrary having united Europe not tightly allied with the US would advance Russian cause of building a multi-polar world that they would much fancy. In multi-polar world Russia can be one of the polars and play other power centres against each other and thus keep up their security.

24;45 : L'adresse de Sylvain est floutée. Pro-pourboire : elle est disponible dans les pages blanches.

25:35 : Fin de la dédicace, qui a donc duré 7 minutes.

26:40 : Petite danse de Sylvain et débat animé avec l'assistance.

28:29 : L'assistance au grand complet passe devant la caméra. Sans floutage.

29:00 : Oh, il y avait aussi un chat dans l'assistance. Suivi par une séance de boîte à questions. La blague de Sylvain vaut son pesant de cacahuètes. Rire aux larmes de l'assistance (...pas).

36:30 : ""Y en a y sont morts et toi tu dis ""c'est sympa"" ?""

37:20 : Sylvain a définitivement le rythme dans la peau.

44:15 : Légère confusion, l'assistance ne veut pas se lancer dans un débat sociétal. Sylvain tourne au gaz hilarant.

45:25 : Le ""coucou, tu veux voir ma bite"" de trop.

49:50 : ""L'émission touche à sa fin"" et Sylvain touche à une vuvuzela. Le retour des Snorkies. Accompagnement à la vuvuzela par Sylvain.

51:20 : ""Tu voulais pas faire un karaoké ?""

55:21 : Le cadavre exquis. Aaaawwww.

56:30 : ""On termine comme ça ?"" Conclusion superbe de Sylvain.

http://www.msz.gov.pl/files/docs/komunikaty/20120918RAPORT/report.pdf

&gt;  **for  some  members  of  the  Group**  this 
could **eventually** involve a European army. 

In any case, I think what they're talking about is not a large territorial army under EU command, but of rapid reaction forces. With EU Battlegroups, there is currently some pan-EU joint defense force, but very small and for full alertness, quick reaction force..

However, with the dissolution of the WEU following the Lisbon treaty, as EU got all of its institutions transferred to it, it got Eurocorps, a pretty sizable rapid reaction force (I gather less rapid than the existing battlegroups, a command center, a joint brigade standing in its core, and assembled on the fly for the mission from units otherwise under national command, largish possible deployments). There have been calls to make them into a european army in the parliament. 

http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=IM-PRESS&amp;reference=20080516BRI29012&amp;secondRef=ITEM-001-EN&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN


&gt;The committee ""proposes to place EUROCORPS as a standing force under EU command and invites all Member States to contribute to it."" 

and interoperability and integration of national armies

&gt;The cooperation between national armed forces should increasingly synchronised and called “SAFE” – Synchronised Armed Forces Europe. The European Parliament notes that a common defence policy in Europe requires an integrated European Armed Force which needs to be equipped with common weapon systems so as to guarantee commonality and interoperability. 

http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=IM-PRESS&amp;reference=20090218IPR49774&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN

I can see a sense in creating common quick response units &amp; frameworks for first joint-mission units arriving in a theater. But see no reason why the bulk of a nation's army wouldn't be under national command, if they're interoperable enough, since it would need time to deploy anyhow.

But haven't yet heard of plans to do anything like that anyhow.

and in this resolution they reference a mechanism already in Lisbon treaty for their plans - permanent structured cooperation (and additionally now allowed enhanced cooperation in defense):

&gt;The  possibilities 
of  the  Lisbon  Treaty,  in  particular  the  establishment  of  Permanent  Structured  Cooperation 
should be implemented.

Mohammeds influence on Muslims is a problem. Just like the bible's claim that god hates gay people is also a problem.

The ideal solution would be to wave a wand and teach every person in the world to think rationally and to not blindly follow any religion.

Unfortunately thats an impossible solution. If we look at the socio-economic root causes of muslim violence, we will have a better chance of preventing extremism and fundamentalism.

My argument is that the main difference between Islam and Christianity (for example) is that Christians, statistically speaking, are more affluent which automatically means they have access to more education and more education leads to skepticism and leads away from extremism.

true,Britzer,GERM,Germany,"&gt; Okay, that's enough wall of text :D

Indeed!

&gt; Due to the mainstream of Christianity basically not being Bible literalists, it's extremely easy for most people to ignore parts of the Bible.

This is not true as such. You can disregard much of the old testament, because it was revised by Jesus. There is nothing in the NT that can be ignored if you want to be a real Christian.

With Islam, even non-fundamentalists hold that everything in the Koran is literally true. There's no imperfection, no doubt, nothing too open for interpretation (beyond the literal variances), and most of all it is all 100% true and 100% directly the word of God.

Yet a lot of moderate Muslims drink alcohol and eat bacon. And do other stuff such as sex before marriage. They are just generally more conservative. Many of them. And even if you take writings as the word of good, you can still interpret so much stuff into it. Just think of the right to ""bear arms"", and how much interpretation went into that. Even though it's written to be understood by fairly modern people just 200 years ago.

&gt; Now some issues you get from this: When someone carries out an act in the name of Islam due to some terrible shit (by modern standards) that it says in a millenia old book, they feel they have a billion people behind them.

You know what? That is pretty much exactly what that Norwegian nutjob said. He also believed a lot of people would support him once he started killing people. And how many did he kill? 70? 80?

&gt; ""Actually, that part of the Koran is wrong.. we shouldn't do that.. that isn't islamic, that isn't what a muslim should do"". Even if they don't agree with it, even if they don't really believe it's the right thing to do, it is extremely difficult to get any muslim to utter a single word like this... nowhere even close.

Now that is slander. Just because some nutjob claims they do shit in favour of Islam, Muslims don't have to stand up everytime and say it's not in their name. Yet they did and do that pretty often. Sorry, but this is Fox News territory, claiming some group didn't say ""sorry"" loud enough, even though they did. Then it didn't count or what. Why would they even have to do something like that anyways? Or do you feel obligated to go public and apologize every day for [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kony), just because he claims he is doing what he does for Christianity, which is some way is the majority religion of Western countries, so we are somehow connected? Claiming Muslims somehow support terrorists, because they don't apologize for them is a Catch22.

&gt; Now back to Christianity... except for a few such at Jehova's Witnesses and other backwards idiots, most Christians these days don't take the Bible literally.

Except when it comes to gays. Jesus says we should love everyone, even our enemies, but St. Paul said that god hates fags (he meant the greeks, but that's another point). So what do the Christians do? Many of them, especially in the US, choose to take the bible literally. Though just the parts they like. Same with all religions. They pick and choose. I haven't heard Christian US armed forces turning the other cheek or have you?

&gt; The issue is that most of Islam believes Mohammed was the final prophet and that the Koran is the ultimate final word that can never be changed. There are sects of Islam (and Baha'i) who allow progressive prophecies and evolution of the Koran, but neither Shia or Sunni allow this.

Yea, I think we went over the already. The more modern a society gets, the more they ignore most of the conservative stuff. At least some people. Again, talk about abortion clinic bombing in the US.

&gt; So what does this situation with Christianity mean in every day practise? It means that if someone commits an atrocious act in the name of Christianity, they don't even mistakenly feel any support from Christians for it. There is simply not a social construct in place that allows someone to become radicalised by the Bible while surrounded by the typical western practising Christians.

That depends. Just ask that Norwegian guy. Anyways, the same applies for Muslims. 

&gt; If you don't believe me, go ask some Muslims and Christians. Pick some at random. Islam has the misfortune that there is no mainstream speaking-out against the source and justification of a lot of the extremism based on their holy book. Just speaking out against the atrocious acts isn't good enough because the construct that allows support is still alive today.

This is getting old. Please stop the bs and [read for yourself](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=muslims+speaking+out+against+terrorism).

&gt; The parts of the Bible that would allow such radicalism are in mainstream Christianity as dead as the old Egyptian scrolls, they are just a piece of history. Folklore, even. Islamic culture has kept those parts alive.

I guess you never heard of Amish people. Or similar radical Christian communities all over the world.

The longer this is going on the harder it is for me to believe you can write such a huge text without any knowledge or research on the matter.

&gt; And I would assert that everyone who isn't willing to speak out and even just ever so slightly (as it takes baby steps for this stuff) to soften the rhetoric around their regard for the infallibility of every letter in the Koran is slightly responsible for the culture that surrounds it.

Your attempt at collective guilt is dangerous, if you take into account that it is the West that is responsible for so much suffering. It was NATO that made sure that Saudi Arabia (the most radical country, exporting their extreme views all over the world) would be secure against secular Iraq under Saddam Hussein. It was us that unleashed the modern Djihad in Afghanistan. We currently support radical Muslim rebels in Syria against a modern and secular dicatorship. We support radical Sunni Muslim Arabia against much more modern Shia Islam from Iran. Saudi Arabia is our ally. They put a lot of money into the Egypt elections to support the Salafists. A party much more extreme in their views than the Muslim Brotherhood.

Other than that we directly kill a lot of people both in Iraq and Afghanistan and are responsible for a lot of killings. Are you actively trying to prevent this? Collective guilt is a bitch. And is one of the things that have no place in modern Western society. And our liberal philosophy and principles.

That is a bit of irony. If we want to stay true to our modern liberal values, you will have to tolerate the more conservative people. The argument that toleration of intolerance leads to intolerance may be true to some extent, but as soon as you stop being tolerant, you become intolerant. Just like the Muslims. You will probabely not believe me, but people like you have a lot in common with the protestors currently freaking out about that Youtube video.

true,Snoron,EURO,"Sandy Lane, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, UK, EU, Earth","Hmmm... well, I don't think you have misunderstood what I've said, but you seem to have misunderstood the point of it as you seem to have framed me as having mounted some attack on Islam.

I'm quite happy for you to disagree with what I've said, but you barely even touched on the point I was actually making - and instead you did a good job of randomly attacking things I never even said.

You've tried to expand the issue way beyond any reasonable bounds, because I am speaking in extreme generalisations of culture surrounding religions with millions or billions of adherents, yet you are bringing up tens of specific people, events, and other circumstantial things.

So let's simplify this into a more level playing field. Forget the Muslim fundamentalists in the middle east. Forget the Christian fundamentalists in the USA. Forget the ""lone"" nut-jobs like Breivik, and forget African warlords.

Take a look at a country in Europe such as the UK or Germany - and compare within that country the cultural difference between the religions. This is where the fairer test lies.

Now try and re-state your argument with that in mind, as almost everything you've said is unfortunately irrelevant to the actual issue here.

And in fairness I must say, I agree with most of what you've said regarding all the things that were irrelevant, but unfortunately again it doesn't really help the discussion at all.

Also - at the same time, I'm not saying that these issues with Islam don't exist in middle eastern countries *too*, or that other problems don't exist in some western countries, particularly the US - but as you have just demonstrated it is far too easily to get distracted when you start to discuss such things. I believe if you address them in a fairer way then you will be able to view the wider situation more accurately without getting as distracted by the hundreds of other variables that obviously exist in such a complex world.

I can ask you in the form of a question if you like, to make it easier. This is basically the same question I have puzzled over to come to the opinion I stated above:

Why is it that people can become radicalised and carry out terrible acts for their religion while living wholly within a modern, western European country, and feel that their actions are justified by their holy texts and that the wider population of Muslims are in support of them (even though this belief is delusional, as I stated)?

Or conversely, what is the difference that makes it so unlikely for this to happen within another religious setting in the same country? (And we don't even have to confine this to Christians)

Not only this, but we're talking people people who grew up on the same streets - went to the same schools - worked at the same jobs!

The major difference is the religion, it is the elephant in the room, it is the one thing that is in common between various events - but as I said I am not attacking the religion here because I believe that to be irrelevant. The same things could and were done under Christianity in a different time, and could even again if the culture shifted back that way.

So sure, Muslims can drink alcohol, but that isn't the point here - it's back to the popular culture surrounding the religions and the way the culture is at this moment in time - not how people are actually practising.

Given the above, why do you think Muslims are able to find the support and justification for these acts mentally, spiritually, communally, etc. Even if these people were sad, depressed, lost, bored, or whatever else - if you removed the religious element *entirely* the justification for the acts would have disappeared, and you would find some terrible events would never have happened... so I assert that we cannot discount that religious element.

But here's where you'll want to just attack me again for attacking Muslims or whatever else - please don't. I am not attacking Islam any more than I am attacking every other religion - the point is the culture that surrounds these things at any point in time.

So if you are going to disagree (and I imagine you will) you honestly need to explain to me why it is in fact *not* the culture surrounding Islam in the UK, for example, that allows a few bad seeds to take root - and maybe you could give some insight into what is *actually* is and the reasons why it doesn't apply anywhere else.

And again, to reiterate, I'm not talking about any sort of collective guilt in any meaningful way. It's not like Muslims have all considered this situation and decided actively to keep everything how it is. If I suggested that there is a small amount of blame to be passed on, it is merely a passive blame, nothing criminal, negligent, or even unethical or immoral.

It's more that I am saying *to* Muslims that this is what I believe the situation to be, and *suggesting* that they keep these things in mind and maybe work slowly to wipe out radicalisation by slowly and gently bringing about the sorts of shifts I have described.

It boils down to this:

I believe that a Muslim culture can exist in the UK where anyone with radical ideas will not feel at home, will not feel support, will not feel part of the community, will not feel justified in any way.

The truth is that right now we do not have that situation.

Now are you either telling me that a) in fact we actually *do* have that situation, or b) that we don't and never will.

He planted the seed of the tree upside down and said:

Afaik, during the Cold War, Romania had a much more ballanced attitude than the Warsaw Pact states (which were more pro-Arab). We were friends with both. Also, a lot of Arab leaders were left-leaning (Assad, Saddam, Arafat, Ghaddafi, etc), plus we were a Francophone nation, so it's no surprise we had good relationship with the Sirians and the Palestinians.

Trading on its cheap labour and copying EU and American products with very poor R&amp;D levels, so essentially living off its cheap labour.

&gt;Korea

A country which has Samsung, a single company, doing the vast majority of everything that anyone worries about. A great country for sure, but not a country to worry about in terms of hostility in any sense.

&gt;Japan

Aging population with stagnation since the early 90's, no longer able to compete on labour with any western nation, and now at the point where their R&amp;D, as great as it is, is constrained by cultural problems and while another great country, is not one to worry about in any systemic sense.

And out-die everyone too, I wouldn't be worrying about Africa posing any problems to the EU any time soon.

&gt;Arabs flip a finger at European values and replace our culture with theirs

No, a lack of integration may be the case, I'd agree, but that's our problem not theirs. The money present in the middle east is huge, but they piss it away and, unlike Asian nations, have massively failed to capitalise on the great income they've had coming in.

&gt; is EU becoming a irrelevant &amp; heavily indebted 3rd world shithole

No, it's not. We have the largest economy in the world, we're incredibly wealthy, we're good at loads of things, and just because we have some sovereign debt problems in the south doesn't change the fact that we're doing amazingly well in the world.

The US, despite its rapidly increasing population and massive income disparity, is still the richest country in the world in raw terms, and one of the richest in per capita (ppp) terms.

RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

A 2011 Eurobarometer survey17 revealed that the overwhelming majority of Europeans think that women should be equally represented in company leadership positions (88%) and that the European business community is dominated by men who do not have sufficient confidence in women's abilities (78%). The survey found that when given the possibility to choose between three options to achieve gender balance on company boards, opinion is divided between self- regulation by companies (31%), binding legal measures (26%), and non-binding measures such as Corporate Governance Codes and Charters (20%). Nevertheless, 75% of Europeans are in favour of legislation on the condition that it takes into account qualification and does not automatically favour members of one sex.",0,1348010096,null,0,false,0,c6a57hs,t3_100mj1,t1_c6a57hs,t1_c6a528e,null,1429933177,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Yes, a lot of people understand western lifestyle and principles like freedom of speech. And a lot of people don't. And those people need to die first.  
By which I don't mean they need to be killed, just that in a society where a large part of the people think that a holy book and people who tell them what it means should be the basis for laws, because their entire worldview is based on it, aren't able to just change their opinion because of something they read on the internet.

There are a lot of new atheists in the states who recently deconverted, but if you read their testemonies you understand how much of a struggle it was for them to change their way of thinking about the world, and how much resistance they got by their family and friends. Besides that, americans have the advantage that virtually everybody has access to the internet, they come in contact with a lot of foreigners (even unknowingly) because english is the second language for many europeans and others, and there's no cencorship of those ideas.  
And even there, there are *a lot* of people who don't understand that (in theory) laws cannot be made just because that's what *your* religion teaches you, that you need a justification that is comprehensable for everybody.

Yes, the internet was used to rally people, spread information and organize revolutions. So, it helps the speed things up. But it didn't come from the internet. It started because the economic situation was bad. And now, the people who envision a more liberal society seem to be outnumbered by the people who think that religion should guide the laws in the country. Still others think things where good the way they where, or at least it was better before all those troublemakers came along. There's still a long way to go, and nobody knows were it'll lead to. It isn't like the west has solved all their problems and are in agreement with how things should be done either, so why should arab societies who lived under dictatorships (which were backed by the west) all for a sudden know where to go from there?

You'd have to be some knuckle dragging neanderthal to believe that there shouldn't be parity in the boardroom if there is equal distribution in the candidate pool.

I've been reading through the report you linked to. I find the amount of twisted meanings and redefinition in it to be absolutely horrifying. If the rest of the EU directives are full of this it's no wonder there are issues.

Page 5:
&gt;Direct discrimination is defined as:
&gt;
&gt;where one person is treated less favourably on grounds of sex than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation.

Seems fair, I'd go along with that definition.

&gt;Indirect discrimination is defined as:
&gt;
&gt;where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons of one sex at a particular disadvantage compared with persons of the other sex,...

Again, seem fair, until you reach the end of that snippet from Article 28.

&gt;...unless that provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified by legitimate aim, and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.

Essentially this says that it's discrimination unless it's discrimination we agree with.


It gets even worse when you head down to page 19.

&gt;...with a view to ensuring full equality in practice between men and women in working life, the principle of equal treatment does not prevent Member States from maintaining or adopting measures providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for the  under-represented sex to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers.

""Positive action"" as defined in these terms is legally permissible discrimination to pursue political objectives.

The European Parliament should be at the top of all lawmaking and enacting passed by the EU, and EU citizens should be encouraged to lobby their MEPs as much as they do their national level representatives. Party and party group policies on specific issues should be easily accessible online. I could go on.

I recall how it was virtually impossible to access the stance of each party's stance on the SOPA vote, and that was a widely publicised issue; imagine what it's like on more subtle issues like economic policy.

It's weak because the member state governments refuse to give it more power, because it will begin to sap power from national capitals. There are two things that could be introduced that would bring the EU's democratic credentials about up to par with those in Western Europe:

1. Legislative Initiative for the Parliament and Council of the European Union
2. Majority voting in both the Parliament and the Council of the European Union

These lack of these two things are the biggest obstacles to an almost parliamentary system of government at the European level. The Commission, the Parliament, and the Council of the EU do not have the authority to give grant the institutions these powers. The burden of making the EU more democratic lies with national governments, not the EU itself. They will ultimately require more treaty changes and treaties. These are almost entirely in the hands of national governments, not the EU. The EU is still far less than the sum of its parts. Until the European people realize that the EU will not become more democratic until they themselves become more pro-European (allowing national politicians to act more boldly), then we'll be stuck arguing about the democratic deficit for many more years.

The constant belief that the EU shouldn't be given more power until it is more democratic is utter nonsense. The two go hand-in-hand. EU officials WANT more democracy because it would legitimize their position and increase their power. It's in their own interests to advocate for democracy. Some of the strongest advocates of increased democratic control comes from those at the highest levels of the EU. When Barroso, Van Rompuy, and Schulz talk about the need for increased democratic control, it isn't just lip service designed to placate the European electorate. They genuinely want more democracy, but people like Merkel, Hollande, Cameron, Monti etc will not grant it to them because it will be at the expense of their own offices and their own countries' sovereignty.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"You don't need to hope. If the parliament has the power to introduce legislation, then it will have obtained a power that national parliaments have. There isn't anything mischievous about it. They're already accountable to an electorate, they just don't have the authority to do anything of real importance. Giving them the ability to do significant work increases the influence of the electorate in the EU. It's very simple, really, and nothing to be afraid of. If anything, you should be wary of giving more power to the Commission and the Council of the European Union, which are unelected bodies that have more influence in the EU than the parliament. Strengthening the parliament is not something to be afraid of at all. It would be just like the House of Commons, except that its constituency is more than 500 million people rather than 62 million. I really don't understand how anyone could be fearful of giving the parliament more power. For god's sake, it can't even do something as fundamental to legislation as introducing it. Giving the parliament more power = more democratic control. It's that simple. By surrendering more sovereignty to a superstate, it saps power from the member states. The member states are the reason why the EU has so many confederate structures. It tries to keep every country happy to a degree by not completely trampling on their sovereignty. The end result is an undemocratic system of prime ministers appointing commissioners and presidents on behalf of the people who didn't directly elect them. Federation will put more control in the hands of the people. Confederation is a terrible form of government, and has almost always failed in practice (Switzerland is the only developed country with a semi-confederate system, but even then it has a lot of federal elements).",0,1348024599,null,0,1348102602,0,c6a8vrp,t3_1035iu,t1_c6a8vrp,t1_c6a8ng6,null,1429934967,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,Britzer,GERM,Germany,"Wow, now I don't know what you are trying to pull here:

&gt; You've tried to expand the issue way beyond any reasonable bounds, because I am speaking in extreme generalisations of culture surrounding religions with millions or billions of adherents, yet you are bringing up tens of specific people, events, and other circumstantial things.

You made very specific claims and leveled very specific accusations against Muslims. 1) Muslims don't stand up to their radicals (or even agree with them) and 2) Muslims live by the letter of the Quaran, while Christians don't. 3) Muslims don't apologize for and/or distance themselves from fundamentalists, because they don't think what they are doing is wrong.

You accused a billion or so people of stuff. Not me! Those are serious accusations. I don't know if you realize that. I don't think you can look into the head of one person. Yet, you presume shit about more than a billion people. Especially number 3 is a very nasty accusation. Because it's not even true. But by saying you didn't find each and every billion Muslim saying so, you can always claim they aren't. This is Islamophobic. Which is why I brought it up in the end. Because at some point you will come across other Islamophobic points. 

&gt; So let's simplify this into a more level playing field. Forget the Muslim fundamentalists in the middle east. Forget the Christian fundamentalists in the USA. Forget the ""lone"" nut-jobs like Breivik, and forget African warlords.

You can't take out half the world, if you want to make broad accusations against a group. That's also pretty nasty little ploy. That's the thing about Islamopobics. You can't accuse all of Islam and then look at isolated stuff. Or excuse all of Christianity by simply not aknowledging the pope (vocal anti condom in the face of HIV, for example).

&gt; Take a look at a country in Europe such as the UK or Germany - and compare within that country the cultural difference between the religions. This is where the fairer test lies.

That is a very skewed look. Same as looking at Two regions of the world and trying to explain all their culture by their religion. The culture came first. Then came the religion. Santa Claus is not in the bible. Yet he is an important part of Christian culture. Jeses wasn't born on the 24th or 25th. That is the time when pagans celebrated winter heliotrope. So the church adopted to the culture. The ruling elite of royalty needed a religion to explain why they ruled. So the church invented royal rule by grace of god. And the rulers spread Christianity in northern Europe. [The treatment of women was there before Islam](http://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/comments/102w6d/head_scarveshijab_and_the_second_place_status_of/). Culture preceded religion and is conjunct with culture these days. And for historical, climate, geographic and vegetational reasons different regions of the world have different culture. Islam is different in Indonesia than in Morocco. There is even a culture in Indonesia where women dominate. It is Muslim. Just like the rest of Indonesia. So far for comparisons.

If you limit yourself to Northern Europe, almost all Muslims are recent immigrants that face a number of challenges that all immigrants face. This is a very special and select group of citizen that in in completely different circumstances compared to the native population.

Many of these immigrants have major problems adapting into the mainstream culture of their new home countries. This has a lot to do with identity crisis. They don't want to forget about their roots, so they double down on them and often come across as more conservative than people in their home countries. This certainly sucks. Also in Germany we have problems with unemployed young Muslims that are second or even third generation immigrants from Turkey. There is a high unemployment rate among them. But a lot of people don't like to talk about these issues, because as soon as you touch them, right wing populists jump on these discussions and it becomes impossible to talk about them, because you suddenly find yourself defending Islam, even though you wanted to talk about unemployment and culture shock. I know it sounds bad, but there are programs to help these people and other than that, because of the mentioned political problems when talking about immigrants, a lot of people are tired of discussing the problem with right wing people. You never get to a solution this way anyways. So please excuse me if I don't have the strength to start one now.

&gt; Why is it that people can become radicalised and carry out terrible acts for their religion while living wholly within a modern, western European country, and feel that their actions are justified by their holy texts and that the wider population of Muslims are in support of them (even though this belief is delusional, as I stated)?

I think you should look into religious cults to answer that. There is even a number of former Christians of European ancestry that were radicalized and turned up in Afghanistan. It takes special circumstances and special people to believe in a cult.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult

There have been Christian cults and now there certain extremist and radical mullahs that preach jihad and can be considered forming Muslim cults. If you want an explanation, you will most likely find it there.

&gt; Or conversely, what is the difference that makes it so unlikely for this to happen within another religious setting in the same country? (And we don't even have to confine this to Christians)

Actually this is not true. I guess Islam can be considered one of the ingredients of current cult movements, but those ingredients are subject to change and don't matter really. A cult can make do with any religion. There are other, more important things that define a cult. Such as a strong charismatic leader, a rigid set of rules (I guess Islam really fits nicely here), isolation from everything else, ... I don't know if they have all those in the Wikipedia article. I was taught about cults, because they were considered dangerous while I was a teenager and so we were taught in religous studies in school on how they work. But as this attack:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarin_gas_attack_on_the_Tokyo_subway

shows, you don't need a certain religion for a cult. They are interchangeable.

&gt; The major difference is the religion, it is the elephant in the room,

As I said, the specific religion is just a fad of the day. In the 60s and 70s Eastern religions (Buddhism, Hinduism) were fashionable. Then came the Christian cults in the 80s and 90s. And now it's Islam's turn, I suppose?

Don't get me wrong. Surely there are differences between the cults. Muslims cult like Mosques with radical teachers are different from cults that use the bible and cults from the 60s. But you were looking for an explanation. And the best one I can offer you is the cult. With their specific culture touched upon in the article. All of them vary in little details, but they are similar where it counts.

true,Mordeth,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt;Especially the smaller countries are very opposed to that (a German or a French citizen has much less voting value than a Swede or a Dutch).

If you have majority voting, bigger countries with more inhabitants will have a bigger influence on the outcome of votes when compared to small countries with less inhabitants. This is unacceptable to said small countries.

If you have representative voting, votes are tallied by country. This means that a small country has an equal say in matters as a bigger country.  This is basically the ""winner-takes-all"" system in the USA, where candidates win by tallying states instead of popular vote.",0,1348045271,null,0,false,0,c6act63,t3_1035iu,t1_c6act63,t1_c6acau7,null,1429936814,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5
