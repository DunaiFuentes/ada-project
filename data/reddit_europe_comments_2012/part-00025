More like wanting Serbia to stop persuading them they aren't Romanian (the idea that they might feel anything else than Romanian has not crossed our minds)

&gt;its ok but not in that manner (to block our integration process). There has been talk about Romanian reaction, and there been some talk about shengen issue. (EU is delaying your shengen assessment or something and you want to make attention)

Yeah, since the Netherlands fucked us over with Schengen, we had a lot of these dick reactions. :)

&gt;I dont believe that there is any kind of 'assimilation master plan'.

Here you have to understand that the Romanian point of view is influenced by analogy with the „[Moldavian question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldovans)”. Long story short: the soviets, and the pro-Russian forces in the post-USSR period have stressed that Moldovan Romanians are not Romanians, but a different ethnicity called Moldovans, that speak a different language called Moldovan, written with cyrillics. This is ridiculous, as „Moldovan” is just Romanian with some extra Russian loanword, but the ideea is that there was/is a policy to „de-nationalize” Romainians in the ex-soviet regions, and a lot of people have interpreted the Vlach organizations that say they are not Romanians as something similar (state assimilationist intervention through subservient organisations)

&gt;I dont think that there is a political problem to recognize them as Romanians, but our presidents and politicians cannot do that (that was my point)

I understand, but some here are more „conspirationist”

true,underwaterlove,EURO,European Union,"Most people outside of Germany only noticed Merkel's ""knee-jerk reaction"", but know little about energy concepts implemented more than a decade before that.

Phasing out nuclear energy and gradually replacing it with renewables had been a long-term goal in German politics for many years. It wasn't until late 2010 that the Merkel administration, under pressure from the nuclear lobby, tried to put legislation into place that would have delayed or stalled that process.

Massive public protests were the consequence, but the government managed to reverse national policy. The new legislation became law in January 2011, and while the national debate was still raging, Fukushima happened. Suddenly, the previous policy of pushing renewables and phasing out nuclear didn't seem to be such a bad idea.

This gave a lot of credence to the opposition parties, and with state elections just around the corner, the only way Merkel's party saw to *not* lose the elections was to one-up the opposition parties by phasing out nuclear even faster than the old timeline would have called for. This maneuver didn't work out, and the Green party still won the state elections.

As long as we can't guarantee the safety of nuclear power i think its not worth the risk. When more stable alternatives have been developed and implemented i might support it, but keeping decades old powerplants open which pose a risk for our future is not the way in my opinion. Also nuclear waste disposal continues to be an issue. 

Green energy is already rivaling its price and completely safe (well you could be hit by a windmill of course, but you shouldn't upset those things in the first place). Green energy is projected to become much more efficient as innovation continues and completely safe. As a consumer i can already choose between green energy and nuclear energy both for the same price. With China taking a big leap in green energy its production cost will lower dramatically. They are investing billions in green energy, creating 9.5 million jobs that we also could have created in Europe to withstand the crisis. 

I think it is important not to close our eyes for nuclear energy because there are many posibilities and huge potential in this area and we need to keep researching it.

Surely you *don't* think we should go over every single kind of service, from making cars to sewing clothes to delivering milk, and decide whether it should be privatized or state-run. I don't have to prove why laundries should be private, the burden of proof is on the one who proposes them nationalized. That's what I mean by ""the private sector is the default choice"".

Thus, there are infinitely many kinds of services and goods provided by the private sector, many of them essential to our lives. The government runs only select few special services, where there are specific reasons why they cannot be private. That's what I mean by saying nationalized is the exception. 

Are we agreed so far?

Over the past decades we have privatized many branches of the economy that traditionally used to be state-run and each time these transitions met with fears and protests. Yet, in the overwhelming majority of cases privatizations were successful - it turned out government involvement hadn't been necessary after all, it was just a result of the status quo. Stuff which is now considered obvious to be privatized, not so long ago was thought ""sacred"".

Now, let's look at the issue at hand. Is law enforcement a special kind of service that must be left in the hands of the government? Well, I think only anarcho-capitalists would argue otherwise. 

However, we're not talking about anything resembling full privatization here. The government would retain full control, we're only talking about outsourcing particular tasks that don't require sworn officers to handle. Are there fundamental reason why *that* shouldn't be done, or is to just a result of the status quo?

Not really, but let's assume that I subscribe to the whole regulated capitalism point of view for the sake of this discussion. Even so, I don't see how privatisation is the default option: if something is more socially beneficial / convenient to be done by the state, then it's done by the state. No special reasons needed.  

&gt; Yet, in the overwhelming majority of cases privatizations were successful - it turned out government involvement hadn't been necessary after all, it was just a result of the status quo.

Well, I'm not really convinced of that. How do you define that a privatisation is successful? Does it lead to reduced prices? Better working conditions for the employees? More social responsibility? Being on the whim of speculators trying to make a quick buck and capitalists only caring for their own profit, I can hardly see any of those positive outcomes occurring. You don't need to look further than the American healthcare system to see how this can go horribly wrong.

As for law enforcement, I'm not sure. It depends on the specific tasks involved. I mean, even if they don't technically require ""sworn officers to handle"" that hardly means that it's safe to privatise.",0,1330793471,null,0,true,0,c3xb7bd,t3_qetu1,t1_c3xb7bd,t1_c3xay51,null,1435734676,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

&gt;Die wahren Gründe der Euro-Krise liegen woanders.

Jeder, der etwas reist, weiß, dass das Leben in Barcelona oder Lissabon teurer als in Berlin ist.
&gt;&gt;Deshalb mussten in diesen Ländern auch die Löhne steigen, während die Löhne in Deutschland stagnierten. Damit bekam Deutschland im Wettbewerb der Produktionsstandorte einen entscheidenden Vorteil. Im Endeffekt konnte Deutschland immer stärker exportieren und damit wachsen, während südeuropäische Länder zunehmend mit einem Handelsdefizit und Arbeitslosigkeit zu kämpfen hatten.
Das Unglück der Peripherie war das Glück der europäischen Kernländer. Das wird natürlich nicht in der Bild-Zeitung propagiert.

Die EU scheitert an sich selbst:

- an der Heterogenität ihrer Mitgliedsstaaten, die durch europaweite *""One Size fits none""*-Maßnahmen wie die Eurozone in Sieger und Verlierer gespalten werden

- am gewollten Mangel von Demokratie, Transparenz, und Rechenschaft gegenüber den Bürgern

- durch Protektionismus, Herrschaft der Exekutive und Agrar-Subventionen als de-facto wichtigste Leistungen

Sie scheitert bestimmt nicht an ""der Narrative"" deutscher Boulevardmedien. Hetzblätter wie *Bild* gibt es in jedem Land.  

&gt;Deshalb mussten in diesen Ländern auch die Löhne steigen, während die Löhne in Deutschland stagnierten   
[...]
&gt;Das Unglück der Peripherie war das Glück der europäischen Kernländer.
[...]

Klar, weil Deutschlands stagnierende Reallöhne natürlich dem ""Glück"" der Bevölkerung ungemein zuträglich sind.

&gt;Falls wir den Euro behalten wollen, und das sollten wir, dann gibt es keinen anderen Ausweg als eine massive Ausweitung der Transferleistungen (beziehungsweise Investitionen) an die Peripherie, um deren Wirtschaftskreislauf zu stärken

Dutschke junior hat offenbar schon wieder vergessen, was er drei Absätze weiter oben geschrieben hat:  

&gt;Seit der Einführung des Euros ist sehr viel Kapital in die europäische Peripherie geflossen, was dazu geführt hat, dass die Lebenshaltungskosten dort stark gestiegen sind. Deshalb mussten in diesen Ländern auch die Löhne steigen

Also die Lösung des Problems ist genau jene Politik zu wiederholen, die es verursacht hat?  

Selbst angesichts des bei Europafanatikern üblichen Niveaus der Argumentation ist das ein gewaltiger Griff ins Klo.

Nebenbei: das ""Kapital"" ist nicht einfach so ""geflossen"" - ganz überwiegend waren das von staatlicher wie privater Seite aufgenommene Kredite, z.B. in Form von Staatsanleihen oder Hypotheken, die jetzt nicht mehr zurückgezahlt werden können.

We can hardly see our political situation in 50 years, let alone 200,000 years. 

Well the numbers certainly speak for it, that seems really safe. But do they only count direct deaths or do they also count the aftermath of the disaster? Since the deathtoll of cancer caused Chernobyl can alone account for more then 58 deaths per year. And that is if i take the lowest possible estimate.  

Edit: don't get me wrong, I'm not saying government should determine what energy is ""good for you"", I'm for a leveled playing field, as long as there is subsidies on fossil fuel, there also should be the same subsidies and tax breaks on green energy. And once the playing field is leveled they can slowly reduce all tax breaks and subsidies (like Germany is doing on coal energy) until its not needed anymore. Its the only way back to a healthy energy market, without stifling innovation.

I've been living here for 5 months. This is my 5th time in Paris as an American. I'll have spent about 7 and a half months here by the time I leave in May. So, I'm hoping my perspective is similar to yours.

Paris is not always billed as the cleanest place or the friendliest place in Europe. However, Paris is like a book. There are so many stories and layers to it that staying here for an extended period of time is really a treat. The longest I'd stayed in Paris before coming here to live had been a month, and I'd done that twice before moving here. 

Paris is expensive. You're best off cooking at home unless you're really well-paid. However, if you want to splurge once a week, a ""plat du jour"" at a local café ranges from 11 to 16 Euros and is usually pretty good. I've gotten lamb, shrimp, duck, etc... for this price and it's very very tasty. 

There are cheap places to eat, and you don't always have to settle for the ""grec"" or ""doner kebab"" for 5 Euros. For 5 Euros, you can get a rotisserie chicken to bring home, you can stop and eat very very tasty and fresh Lebanese food, or you can get Falafel in the Marais (Rue des Rosiers, 5th arrondissement).

Knowing the language is very helpful. At LEAST familiarize yourself with greetings and how to order things. Don't bother learning taxi instructions because taxis here are expensive, and frankly rather unnecessary. 

Your jobs hopefully will be comping you 50% of your monthly metro pass, so you only end up paying 32.50 Euros or something for your share of the monthly pass. This thing is your pass to Paris, though I still recommend you walk any shorter distances you can. 

Recommended places that are not generally on the radar:

* Parc Montsouris
* Memorial to the Martyrs of the Deportation (near Notre Dame)
* The area between Porte d'Ivry and Place d'Italie (13th Arrondissement). It's the predominantly Asian quarter and there is lots of good and not overly expensive Asian food. It's a LOT less seedy than the area near Belleville (another Asian/Arab area)

* bread: go to your local boulangerie and try classic bread such a baguette or tradition and get used to it :)
* viennoiserie: pains au chocolat, croissant... even macaron...
* olive oil: I'm not sure about it, but I think it's not really a part of American cuisine... I've missed it a lot when I was abroad.
* ham: we actually have real ham here, try the famous ""pata negra"" (Iberic ham), it's Spanish but you'll find it easily.
* magret de canard: just google/try it
* foi gras: obvious
* Wines!

1. If you're not fluent, learn as much french as you can. Meeting people with a language barrier is hard, and Parisians tend to be very exposed to tourists all year round, which mean they also get tired of foreigners more easily than  your garden variety french person.
2. Get a monthly or a yearly pass for the metro (take Navigo Découverte). Your job should pay for part of it, and whatever you take will be cheaper than buying tickets all the time, especially if you go to the suburbs for whatever reason.
3. On escalators : people stand on the right. People climb up on the left. Expect people to ask you to move/be rude/just shove past you if you don't respect this unspoken rule.
4. Don't eat at St Michel unless someone recommended the restaurant. Loads of shitty places, Loads of good but too expensive places.
5. Generally speaking, if a restaurant in a crowded place has a ""caller"" (someone who stands outside just saying how cheap and/or delicious their food is) don't go there.
6. Use Couchsurfing.org if you feel lost and need some english outings to cheer you up. They organize meet-ups, I did some of those and it's mostly a good time and nice people.
7. VISIT THE CATACOMBS
8. You're here during the summer, great. If you're a night owl, take a one-day Velib ticket (you'll know what i mean when you come here), and use it starting 23 o'clock. Visit the city by night, go to ""La marine"" at 2 am to get a beer (the bar is classy and is at montparnasse), look at notre-dame whith the moon overhead.

Additional info I only thought of later:

- ratp.fr has an English version
- the « RER D » lines are indicated by a green D within a green circle
- choose the correct direction: within each line, the direction is indicated by their terminus or termini; it will not be obvious which RER D platform goes to Gare du Nord and which platform goes away from it; learn the name of the correct termini beforehand and check once you're on the platform
- metro tickets are expensive when bought one by one, and significantly cheaper when bought 10 at a time; find someone buying 10 and offer to buy one from him/her at the reduced price
- when using the ratp.fr website to compute how long it will take, indicate that you are coming from Gare de Lyon « SNCF Grandes Lignes » and going to Gare du Nord « SNCF Grandes Lignes » (RATP is the transport company in the paris region, SNCF is the national train company, but it also has local lines in the Paris region, hence the « Grandes Lignes » which states that you're interested in the non-local trains.

TBH I don't get those kind of calls that much anymore, but for those of you who are tired of this you can always call the company directly and ask them to remove your personal information from their potential customers database. To make sure this works, I would also record such call, informing whoever's on the other end of the line that the call will be recorded. If you do this and keep receiving calls or emails from the company, I understand you can legally sue them for breaking the LOPD.

Obviously the services offered by that site sound a lot better at first, but if you look closely there's no law or regulation enforcing companies to consult lists such as this, or to be affiliated with the entity that promotes it.

Strawman, strawman, strawman, strawman.

I was clearly assuming a framework of principles above cultural norms, because rights can't arise out of cultural norms without such assumed principles. Those assumed principles must be universal, and an individual right to such life and autonomy is such a universal principle. No person has a better right than me to tell me what to do and how to act if I am not interfering with them.

What I'm saying is this - these rights, to travel, express oneself and live and work inhere in us as human beings, not because of where we live. Migration is a fact of life and not a special circumstance. If I come from somewhere else I should have full right to all of these things insofar as it doesn't limit the exercise of the same rights by another. If it does interfere with the rights of another, one or other person, or both have to have their rights limited. Where they are limited, the place of origin of a person shouldn't matter - limitations should be justified by reference to principles which treat everyone equally as human beings.

&gt;No, you play by the rules because you're escaping a shit life. It's not mindlessly giving privilege to 'the people who got there first'. Where the fuck is the privilege here? 

This exactly the mindless privilege I was talking about. Why do I get to prescribe conditions because I was here first? And ""you are escaping a shit life, therefore you have no rights"" doesn't cut it. Just because somebody else abused your rights doesn't justify me doing it.

&gt;Additionally, if you moved 5 million French people into country X in the Middle East, do you think their government would give a fuck about what they want? The fact that this situation even makes the news and is a contentious issue shows how kind they really are, that it was even considered.

Same logic applies here.

Questo il commento trovato su il Fatto quotidiano di un tizio che si e' dato la pena di fare le pulci a Travaglio (scusate il muro di testo):


Travaglio: « Basta dare un’occhiata ai dati del traffico merci tra l’Italia e la Francia che, salito fino al 2000, da allora è colato a picco. L’ufficio federale dei trasporti svizzero calcola che nel 2000 viaggiavano 8 milioni di tonnellate di merci, oggi ne viaggiano 2 e mezzo »
Gli scambi di merci tra Italia e Francia sono stati pari a 33 milioni di tonnellate nel 2011: erano 30,2 nel 2009, mentre nel periodo pre-crisi (anno 2007) avevano raggiunto i 44,9 milioni di tonnellate trasportate. Nel 2000, l’anno dopo il quale secondo Travaglio ci sarebbe stato il tracollo, gli scambi Italia-Francia raggiungevano i 40,8 milioni di tonnellate [fonte: coeweb-istat, senza andare a scomodare gli svizzeri che cosa ne potranno mai sapere di quel che avviene tra italia e francia?]
Attraverso i trafori di collegamento con l’Europa occidentale, vale a dire Frejus, Monte Bianco e San Bernardo, i mezzi pesanti che OGNI GIORNO transitavano nel 2000 erano 4.451, nel 2007 sono saliti a 4.531. La crisi del 2008 ha rallentato il trend di crescita delle movimentazioni su gomma, tanto che nel 2009 si è scesi a 3.528 transiti al giorno, ma già nella prima metà del 2011 si è tornati sopra i 4.000 (4.131 per l’esattezza) e quando la recessione sarà superata tale valore è destinato a crescere notevolmente [fonte: aiscat]

Travaglio: « ormai il grosso passa dal gottardo e dal brennero »
Gottardo e Brennero sono utilizzati per andare in Svizzera, in Austria e in Germania, mentre per andare in Francia, in Belgio e in Gran Bretagna si utilizzano Frejus e Monte Bianco (http://i45.tinypic.com/34yrww7... ma forse Travaglio avrebbe bisogno d’un piccolo ripasso anche di geografia? Ovviamente no, sa bene dove si trovano i vari valichi. In effetti Sua Infallibilità si riferiva soltanto al traffico ferroviario e, certo, per il Gottardo e per il Brennero i treni merci passano frequentemente (non quelli di trenitalia, ovviamente, ma quelli di Hupac e quelli di RTC), mentre da e per la Francia non ci passano. Non viene in mente, al signor Travaglio, che questo fenomeno conferma proprio l’impraticabilità della linea storica Torino-Modane per il trasporto ferroviario delle merci? Cioè che le merci da e per la Francia non usano il treno perché impraticabile, a differenza di quanto avviene dove la linea-pur tra i mille limiti che hanno infrastrutture costruite più d’un secolo fa-è leggermente migliore? Ridurre le pendenze da quelle attuali, impraticabili, del 33‰, a pendenze più ragionevoli, ossia del 12‰, è l'obiettivo fondamentale del progetto attualmente in discussione. Non certo ""far arrivare le rape e le fave mezz'ora prima"", ma utilizzare per i prodotti della meccanica e dell'elettronica e di tutti i comparti italiani che esportano il treno invece che la gomma.

Travaglio: « Il vecchio treno diretto torino-lione è stato soppresso »

Travaglio: « Il differenziale dei costi tra l’Italia e la Francia, lo spread del magna magna, ha un nome soltanto: tangenti»
Sulla parte dei costi [Il costo previsto è di 8,2 miliardi. L'Ue potrebbe finanziare fino al 40 per cento (3,3 miliardi), Roma 2,7 miliardi e Parigi 2,1 miliardi] ha già risposto due anni fa Virano, con queste parole: “i lavori della Parte Comune, da Chiusa di S. Michele a S. Jean de Maurienne, per circa 84 km (di cui 49 in Francia e 35 in Italia) saranno appaltati da un unico promotore pubblico binazionale con modalità e procedure unificate nei due Paesi, rendendo impossibili disparità di costi delle medesime opere sui due lati della frontiera. E’ altresì chiaro che la compartecipazione finanziaria dell’Unione Europea, del Governo francese e del Governo italiano impone sempre un triplice ordine di verifiche in parallelo da parte dei vari organi di controllo (ad es. le varie Corti dei Conti). L’esistenza di un simile quadro di certezze per la parte internazionale diventa termine di paragone anche per il controllo dei costi della parte nazionale, trattandosi quasi sempre di opere del tutto analoghe. Infine i costi unitari complessivi, stimati in circa 100 milioni a km (euro 2010), sono del tutto in linea con quelli internazionalmente praticati ad esempio per il Brennero e per il San Gottardo i cui tunnel di base, di circa 57 km, sono comparabili con quello progettato per la Torino Lione

Travaglio: « Il tav torino-lione nasce 21 anni fa (…) un’altra era geologica, quando i politici (…) sappiamo cosa ci hanno 
lasciato di grosso: il debito pubblico, in eredità »
Male non farebbe, a Travaglio, anche questo piccolo e interessante ripasso di economia per capire quando è cresciuto il debito pubblico in Italia http://www.youtube.com/watch?v...

From the central station (Centrale FS) you can easily take the Metro to most places, so make sure to get a 1-week ticket at one of the machines at the station.  [Here's](http://subway.umka.org/maps/milan.gif) of Milan's Metro system - you station is where the yellow and green lines meet.

For clubs, Le Banque is close to the Duomo and pretty good.  I've also been to Old Fashioned, Hollywood, and Alcatraz.  I didn't care for Hollywood.  Alcatraz has live music earlier in the nights, which is fun, and Old Fashioned is kind of small but usually pretty fun.  If you're in ERASMUS, bring your card or school idea when you go out and you can probably get into clubs at a discount.

The most obvious tourist spectacle in Milan is the Duomo - easy to find, seeing that it's a stop on the yellow line.  You can enter for free or pay to go to the tower - the view is supposed to be spectacular in the tower.  The Duomo is also the shopping center of Milan, so you can spend quite a bit of time there.  Also, if you take the red line to Cairoli, you can see the Castle (Castello) of Milan.  If you want to see the Last Supper painting, you'd have to buy tickets online, and ASAP.

For the evenings, it's very popular to go to an Aperitivo - there are tons of these.  These are bars where you buy one drink, and are able to eat as much as you want at a buffet set up in the bar.  The food is actually really great, too - it's a great night.  Drinks are expensive here, so this is more of a dining option.  In particular, I've liked the [Iguana Cafe (or Yguama)](http://milano.tonight.eu/aperitivo_happy_hour/yguana) aperitivo.

In France, we have this principle called Republicanism. This has nothing to do with the American one. It is on these principles that the French Revolution was carried out and still greatly impacts the institutions of the country. Republicanism stopped all the preferential treatments that nobles had before the revolution, and put the church down. The principles are well summarized by our motto - Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. Basically, instead of having the King, nobility, and church as the supreme powers, it was now the State and its citizens. Today this seems pretty normal, but then it was very revolutionary and it still shapes France. State institutions still carry alot of importance.

Unlike Anglo-Saxon countries, Equality and Fraternity carry alot of weight. This is the notion that everyone should be treated equal and that people should be participative in the Republic.

Now the reason why there is an issue about this is when STATE INSTITUTIONS such as munipal pools and public school cafetarias do not respect the principles of Equality and fraternity. This is further than a left/right issue (even though both sides use this argument all the time to defend their policies, kind of like American politicians and ""the constitution"".) For me as a Frenchman, even though I see nothing wrong with people eating halal food or women swimming hours, I can easily see why this would be a problem for many. Again back to the French revolution when the church was kicked out. Today there is total seperation of church and state which has nothing to do with what you see in UK or US. It is MUCH more extreme in France, the state can not be associated with ANY religious signs. The only exception is Alsace as it was a German territory when the law was passed.

Now back to the story. Obviously here, Sarkozy is appealing to the far right for votes before the election. However, it is not just him being mean to Muslims and restricting their rights.

true,lockdownit,cinefilo,,"As a lifelong Milanese who's been on the top of the Duomo quite a few time, I can confirm that the view from there is staggering.

Other than the tips you already received, I'll go for the obvious - avoid the tourist traps, so no food from the overpriced restaurant in the front of the Duomo - you can find other places to eat well without coughing up a ton of money. Depending where you come from Milan can be cheap or costly (cheaper than london, but costly than vienna -ish).

If you're more into pubs, check out the football - it's in Via Torino, very near to the Duomo, and the owners are fluent in english. Be warned: it's a sports bar, so on game night it's packed. 

You can get a huge buffet for your aperitivo at the Hora Feliz, another venue located near the Duomo. Now If you're at the Hora Felizx you are almost at the Colonne di San Lorenzo, a big square that owes its name to the church and the columns that are therein located. This is a popular spot for young people to gather, and there are several small bars that sell you beers and cocktails to take away. I won't say that this is a zone where you might find trees, but I'll say that if you're so inclined, this is a zone where you might find some police. every night.

If you cross the street (Molino delle Armi), you can have a nice evening/night walk down in Corso di Porta Ticinese. While small, this Corso houses many small business (mostly take away food providers, of any ethnicity), and on the walls you might gaze upon not-so-acient urban scrawl. There are also a couple of nice all you can eat sushi places. Go down the street and when you see the McDonald's you'll know you're in Piazza 24 Maggio - the one with tha big arch over there. Have fun figuring out how to cross the street to get on the Naviglio - Milan's very own river. That's not a river, it's just a canal. Well, ""just a canal"", they were designed by Leonardo Da Vinci to speed up the building of the Duomo. BUT I DIGRESS. We're talking drinking here.

Choose one of the two navigli (they are called Pavese and Grande); On the naviglio Pavese you'll find countless bars and puibs and general debauchery, while on the naviglio Grande you will ecnounter the same, plus the best place in Milan to get a Pita Gyros.

Non sono mica un giornalista, e in ogni caso, se non hai mai sentito parlare di Dulbecco, scusami sai ma vuol dire che vivi sotto una roccia, o che hai 15 anni: ""Nel 1999 presenta il Festival di Sanremo insieme a Fabio Fazio e Laetitia Casta.

&gt; O hai aspettato che morisse prima di fare un post derogatorio verso reddit, su reddit?

Ho fatto pure un post su worldnews, che ha ricevuto un (un) upvote. Della serie tutto il mondo è paese.

&gt; Ma ti aspetti che la gente venga informata ed educata dallo spirito santo?

No, mi aspetto che la gente si educhi anche da sola. Tutti gli italiani sanno quanto fa schifo la nostra TV. C'è internet, ci sono le biblioteche, ci sono i libri. Almeno sapere chi sono i giocatori italiani sul piano dell'innovazione, le menti brillanti che incrementano la nostra dignità come nazione e il nostro PIL. Non mi parrebbe uno sforzo immane.
Però sappiamo tutto dei giocatori de'a roma.

&gt;  Mi pare normale che, volente o nolente, ci siano informazioni che sfuggano ai più per qualsiasi ragione, o sbaglio?

Sono d'accordo che non puoi sapere tutto. Ma sono anche dell'idea che come nazione abbiamo delle personalità eccellenti, che vengono ignorate o addirittura allontanate. E non parlo solo di persone di scienza. Dimmi dell'ultima volta in cui qualcosa è stato detto di Ennio Morricone.

&gt; Forse non avete\abbiamo ancora capito che stiamo tutti sulla stessa barca e che ci dobbiamo aiutare a vicenda.

Finchè l'attitudine è quella di prendere il frutto e ringraziare con un calcio in culo, la vedo dura. Per di più, c'è un rifiuto sistematico verso chi ha le capacità e la conoscenza per farlo, vedi il nostro amico che si cura con le poesie.

&gt; Sei a conoscenza di una persona che ha dato tanto ma che è poco conosciuta? Rendila pubblica più di quanto non sia già.

Per poi sentirmi dire che sono pericoloso ?

&gt; Questa dicussione fino ad ora è servita solo a fare polemica sterile, quando sarebbe potuta essere impostata facilmente in modo da divulgare piuttosto che insultare.
&gt; Scelta tua, anzi, probabilmente era il tuo intento fin dall'inizio, però mi viene da pensare che alla fine gli 'scumbag' non sono quelli che erano per strada a salutare Dalla.

And in practice they have not really fired any public sector workers, only removed some empty and useless positions.  Any positive effect these measures could have had were completely cancelled out by additional useless regulations targeted at small and medium businesses (big companies can always find ways to avoid such regulations).

We Muslims are rotting with out any identity. Now, French Jew is taking us as issues. Politics thrives in controversial issues. One controversy is always by mocking at Islam. this job is always done by opportunits Jews who attack the vulnerable weak segment of society- Muslims. We Muslims must decide if we continue to live in the West with this much begging to be accepted. My question is why White hate Islam? Are they not men of free? Or is such love obsession for Jesus so infectious? For all the science they do.

qualche pastore greco probabilmente, come salicilico dalla corteccia. Comunque no. Ho sempre pensato fosse una scoperta della Bayer.

&gt; e il nome del tipo che ha disegnato la gioconda?

Sì, ma non di certo per la gioconda. Lo ricordo per un mare di altre ragioni, come il fatto che fu un visionario, un grande ingegnere, un grande artista, e un grande osservatore del mondo.

Ad ogni modo, approvo ciò che dici, e il fatto che ci sia questo sbilanciamento e questa mancanza di notabilità al pubblico generale di persone importanti per il nostro tenore di vita odierno è veramente triste. Questo, a mio parere, è anche un po' colpa di Angela (Sr. e poi Jr.), che da un grande divulgatore scientifico, è diventato un (sempre grande) divulgatore storico.

Sebbene io mi ritenga un grande appassionato di storia e filosofia, sono anche un grande appassionato di tecnologia e futurologia. E per tracciare la strada di domani, ci serve la conoscenza e il furor di popolo necessari a motivare la competitività della ricerca scientifica, di cui siamo fanalino di coda dell'Europa, e solo in alcuni campi siamo ancora, anche se non all'avanguardia, ad un livello dignitoso.

Seemingly, yes, judging by the quite small amount of cage (not old-style, but those new, bigger cages) eggs German supermarkets stock. Eggs not sold in shells but as part of noodles or such are a completely different matter, but I bet that *if* regulations are changes so that the eggs' origins have to be printed in the ingredient list that's going to drop fast.

The Swiss do without old-style cages since 1992, Germany since 2009, and when it comes down to it the UK will be able to do it, too, provided you stop your whining.

Je me demande également si une des différences entre les deux ne serait pas l'ajout de lait et d'un peu de farine de froment dans la crêpe alors que la galette serait faite à base de seule farine de blé noir et avec de l'eau...Mais je n'ai ici aucune certitude.

Dans tous les cas, chez moi, la crêpe exige un matériel spécifique et évidemment, une bonne dose de savoir-faire. Dans ma famille, on fait la crêpe toujours sur une [billig](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billig). On met d'abord du [saindoux](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saindoux) (graisse de porc) sur la billig, puis on verse la pâte et on utilise alors la [rozell et la spanell](http://www.biscuiteriedelapointeduraz.com/Produits_Rozell_et_Spanell-384-232-76-0.html) pour étaler finement cette pâte et pour la retourner une fois. Puis on met dans la crêpe du beurre (salé évidemment, pour le breton c'est un pléonasme) et tout autre chose qui nous ferait plaisir.

Pour la recette de la pâte, si ça t'intéresse, je peux la demander à ma famille, je ne l'ai pas encore avec moi car je n'ai pas de billig: et sans billig, pas de crêpes!

1: When Cyprus was joining the EU, reunification was supposed to be condition. Therefore they negotiated a contract for reunification and took a vote on it. Northern Cyprus (aligned with Turkey, not internationally recognized) voted in favour, Souther Cyprus (aligned with Greece, now EU country) voted **against reunification**. Nothern Cyprus has serious economical problems because of their non existant international recognition. Planes only fly to and from Turkey. I don't know about trade. I don't know if/how a unification of Turkey and Norther Cyprus would help that, but there aren't that many options for the Northerners after the South decided they didn't want them back.

2: Why was Southern Cyprus taken into the EU despite not meeting the condition of reunification? A friend who knows a thing or two about diplomacy and the EU told me that there were many EU people pretty glad, because a reunified Cyprus would have been the first country with an (at least in part) Islamic tradition to join the EU. It could have set the precedent for a much larger Islamic country (Turkey), that some people don't want to see as part of the EU ever.

I write a blog about [how to live and work in another country](http://overseas-exile.blogspot.com/p/where-do-i-start.html) and that may answer a lot of questions you have.

Much of the information is *not* specific to France as [I've just moved here](http://overseas-exile.blogspot.com/2012/01/paris-apartment.html), but in general, you're not going to move their as Americans unless you have a job offer. That being said, there are **lots** of variables involved and the ""job offer"" sentence, while probably true, may be way off.

If you already have an avenue into France (perhaps one of you has dual nationality with an EU country?), then learn your French and learn it well. It should take you, I believe, about 5 years of residency before you can get citizenship, but they've recently updated the requirements for language skills before you can get citizenship. You are very unlikely to get a job if you can't speak the language, but like everything else, there are exceptions.

Feel free to ask me any questions you may have, either here or on my blog (the latter is preferred because other readers can see the answers).

I am sorry if I came across as arrogant, I was trying to observational. EU membership seems to have a huge draw. So much that many countries reshape almost their entire political system (domestic and foreign policy) in order to apply. If I am not mistaken, this also applies to Turkey, which changed a whole bunch of laws and some institutions after EU recommendations.

Is EU membership really worth all that? Is it worth anything at all? I have no idea. I guess it depends on what you want. I think it is rather a vehicle for political reform. A lot (if not all) of the EU policy recommendations to apply for EU membership are a very good idea for a modern, efficient and democratic country. But you would never get those reforms done, because there is no influential demand for them. Political systems tend to stabilize themselves. Especially democratic ones. Destabilized countries have to go through some pretty epic stuff and still mostly cling to their systems. For example Mubarak has gone in Egypt, but the old system still mostly prevails.

Which explains the style of the production, the music, the camera work, the whistling.. you know all of that stuff is copied from Tarantino's Kill Bill. This is a homage to Kill Bill which is a homage to mostly Asian martial art action movies (wikipedia lists them as: [Hong Kong martial arts films](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_action_cinema), [Japanese chanbara films](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanbara), [Italian spaghetti westerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_western), [girls with guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls_with_guns), and [rape and revenge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_and_revenge_films)). In those movies there are a lot of the characters that are over-simplified race stereotypes. Those are represented in anime and manga too.

So the stereotypical challengers that appear **obviously** represent the new rising powers in the world China, India and Brasil (the black man is dressed for and displaying [Capoeira](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira)).

The multiplying of the woman (who obviously represents Europe) is the European Union as later revealed by the 12 stars on the EU Flag. That is the symbolism here: she gathers strength in being a group of people (countries) working together instead of a lone fighter.

I can't confirm this, but the rules are more relax now than they where ten years ago. I know of people who have successfully smuggled ham from Spain into USA (not the leg tho, presliced).

If someone screws up at a solar plant the most that could happen is an area is blacked out, and someone has to shell out for repairs at the power plant, and people might need medical attention if they were injured at the power plant. With hydroelectric, an area is flooded, power goes out, medical attention is needed, and the power plant needs repairs. Now with nuclear, if somebody has a minor slip up, consequences usually aren't bad, maybe the power goes out for a while, and you have to call in a repair crew. Though if somebody screws up big time, whether it be somebody at the plant, or an uncaught software bug, there could be major consequences. Radioactive particles could be spread by the winds to large areas of land, those same particles could be absorbed into the surrounding water/land of the plant, etc. Not to mention that this 'damage' doesn't go away, like say a flood does, it stays for decades, upon decades, if not centuries(not sure if this is correct). This in turn means that if someone screws up now, the effects will effect many generations to come, and I really don't think such a long-term, and significant, decision should be up to one generation.

On the other hand I don't think we should just throw nuclear energy by the wayside either. It has revolutionized the world by giving us submarines, and ships, that can stay at sea for years at a time, given they have enough food. It has also given us the ability to create long term spacecraft that do not rely on solar power alone, Pioneer-11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2 anyone? I think we should continue with researching it at least to the point where we can give ourselves an 'undo' button of sorts that could counteract the effects that an event, such as Chernobyl, would create. If such was the case I'd support it fully because if we screwed things up the accident might effect our generation, but wouldn't effect/have very minor effect on any future generation.

What I'm trying to get at is that even though nuclear energy may be extremely safe, the consequences that accompany an accident are much too great no matter how low the accident rate is. Though I do agree that research, and development should continue on a scale that is small that the effects would be quite small.

tl;dr: The consequences of nuclear disasters are too great, and longterm, at the moment. As such we should not use nuclear energy. But it is too useful to throw by the wayside, and thus should continued to be researched to allow us to undo the effects of a disaster.",0,1330964501,null,0,false,0,c3xwbz4,t3_qfnfj,t1_c3xwbz4,t1_c3xbbuz,null,1428470997,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

In one concise volume, Hagen Schulze brilliantly conveys the full sweep of German history, from the days of the Romans to the fall of the Berlin Wall. A story two thousand years in the making, it rings with battle, murmurs with intrigue, and hums with the music of everyday life. This richly various legacy, often overshadowed and distorted by the nation's recent past, offers a hopeful answer to the perennial question of what kind of country Germany is and will be.

I'm not into political correctness but this is just a perfect example of the ironies and pitfalls of the contemporary notions of multiculturalism that the EU has been expounding for years. Not to mention that it is superficial propaganda that falls flat if you take a deeper look at the position in which the immigrants have been finding themselves all over Europe throughout the last decade. The reality of politics is so removed from what is the declarative vision of the EU as a multicultural, cooperative, tolerant society that it makes the whole thing obnoxious.   

I remember watching this year's traditional New Year concert by the Vienna Philharmonic which featured a video spot set to classical music with a narrative which was about a black girl in love with a white boy, and a lot of other people of all ethnic backgrounds smiling and dancing around, and of course the story had a happy ending and it was all sunshine and rainbows. This kind of thing has become emblematic of European propaganda. It tries so hard to portray an unrealistic vision of a civilized post-ethnic Europe that it just seems ridiculous to anyone with any sort of awareness for that kind of thing, and most of all utterly fake.

A a side note, OP video is trashy as hell on both a formal level and as a tribute to Kill Bill (WHY?), even not counting the distasteful politics and propaganda.

I had applied for and obtained my French citizenship before moving (based on marriage with a French citizen). The citizenship thing was apparently much easier before Sarko came along. If neither of you are French (or EU) citizens, then the immigration part isn't going to be all that simple. [Start by looking here](http://ec.europa.eu/immigration/) or checking in with your nearest French consulate. Student visas are another thing entirely... I'd start by asking at your nearest university's study abroad office. Regardless, you absolutely have to sort out the visa/immigration legalities before you leave.

Getting settled into France can be a bit daunting at first, mostly because things don't always work like you'd expect them to. For example: you need a fixed address to open a bank account and a bank account to get a fixed address. In addition, the paperwork necessary for a rental agreement is absurdly complicated if you go through a real estate agency... Try to work privately with someone through the classifieds and it'll be easier.

The question about getting a job is really hard to answer, but generally speaking if you aren't fluent in French it's not going to be simple unless you find a position where they are looking for an English speaker. Even then, the labor laws are so tight in France that it will seem totally crazy compared to what you are used to in the US. Companies are less likely to hire you right on the spot, and you'll get a temporary work contract for 3 months before they offer you a permanent position. None of this applies if you are a student, of course.

I found the transition to be ridiculously easy, but then again I prefer the food and the lifestyle over here (it's hard not to). There are frustrating aspects that will be different for everyone, but I still maintain that on the whole the French don't know how good they've really got it. :)",0,1330968612,null,0,false,0,c3xx2v1,t3_qig2z,t1_c3xx2v1,t3_qig2z,null,1428471349,5,false,france,t5_2qhjz,5

We Portuguese are very peaceful and quiet, he isn't applauded everywhere he goes but there are also no riots like that. There's a considerable amount of strikes but it's mostly in the public sector where he's cutting the most and it's always the same bunch who disagrees with his policies, namely the unions and the communists who are never pleased.

That's quite annoying but those strikes don't have the public support, most people actually loathe them because every time the public transports don't work people have a much harder time getting to work and it's indeed very unfair that these people like the train drivers are not working nor letting others work because they'll lose benefits the private sector never had in the first place.

But the PM is dealing with this carefully as he knows that if he cuts where he really shouldn't (like in the NHS or in the public education system) that could cost him the next election and since the measures only give you the objectives and not how to achieve them, some measures don't leave the discussing phase (ex: one extra half hour in the work period from 8h to 8h30).

Overall, and since people here aren't exactly fanatical about anything, specially politics, he just is doing his thing and even though he has a majority in coalition, he's willing to hear others' input on his measures. Considering his opposition just isn't doing a good job and often is the one not willing to change his position even though they aren't the ones in charge, I'm pretty sure that if things continue like this, he'll get a landslide victory in the next election.

La Sindrome di Asperger (abbreviata in SA)[1] è considerata un disturbo pervasivo dello sviluppo imparentata con l'autismo e comunemente considerata una forma dello spettro autistico ""ad alto funzionamento"". Il termine ""Sindrome di Asperger"" venne coniato dalla psichiatra inglese Lorna Wing in una rivista medica del 1981; lo chiamò così in onore di Hans Asperger, uno psichiatra e pediatra austriaco il cui lavoro non venne riconosciuto fino agli anni novanta.

Gli individui portatori di questa sindrome (la cui eziologia è ancora ignota) sono caratterizzati dall'avere una persistente compromissione delle interazioni sociali, schemi di comportamento ripetitivi e stereotipati, attività e interessi molto ristretti. 

Considerando che studio e mi interesso di storia, filosofia, religione, geologia, chimica, fisica, matematica, biologia, informatica e tecnologia, che parlo 4 lingue e che ho amici in tutta Europa, penso che la tua classificazione sia tipicamente un ""ad hominem"" per mascherare la tua pochezza intellettuale. E bada, non sono un genio. Sono semplicemente curioso, e penso che dovresti esserlo un po' anche tu.

true,buzaow,null,null,"Il faut préciser ton sujet la "" diversité"" c'est un peu vaste comme champs. Si il a volontairement était mal défini par le prof, c'est qu'il veut que tu choisis un angle d'attaque. Tu pourrais par l'exemple l'approcher de manière sociologique ( ex : la question du communautarisme, l'idée du métissage des identités...) ou sous l'angle des politiques publiques ( le rôle de l'Etat et des politiques publiques dans la promotion / reconnaissance des minorités en France). 

 La difficulté de ton sujet réside dans sa définition, soit le choix que tu vas faire de traiter ceci ou cela. Il semble que t'as déjà fait le choix de t'intéresser à la question de l’immigration et au population française issu de l'immigration.  Très bien mais il faudra alors justifier pourquoi, tu exclus par exemple la diversité culturelle ( l'idée que les pouvoirs publics doivent soutenir la danse, le théâtre, les musées, même si tout le monde s'en fous). 

Je te donne vite fait quelques éléments de réflexion :
- on entend beaucoup parler de diversité, il faut se méfier du terme. Il est flou et donc instrumentalisé facilement par des politiques pour dire n'importe quoi. 

- la diversité comme tu l'entends est une question identitaire. qu'est ce qui fait que les arabes, les roms sont différents des français ? ces différents identités n'ont pas la même image dans l'opinion publique, n'ont pas la même histoire. 

- la question du communautarisme. Ces identités sont elles fermés aux autres, comme nous le répète le FN, ou est ce que c'est nous, français blancs, qui les enfermons ? Un exemple récent est la rénovation de la Samaritaine à Paris : on installe des logements sociaux dans le centre de paris et les voisins bourgeois sont pas contents.

- La question de l'intégration : est ce que intégrer des populations étrangères revient à les écraser et en faire des bons français  qui mange du saucisson ou à faire coexister leur culture avec la notre ? 

- si tu es amené à parler de comment on devient français, il faut évoquer le droit du sol qui est de vigueur en France, et l'opposer au droit du sang allemand.

- tu peux comparer ce que tu constates en France, avec ce qui se passe dans ton pays ( melting pot vs salad bowl...) 

Pour les ressources bibliographique tu as les sites internet Persée, et CAIRN, qui rassemble des publications universitaires  en sciences humaines. 
Pour les video, y'a le site de l'INA ( archive télé française) ou tu pourra surement trouver des vidéos de manifestations, etc.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"In one thousand years, it is probable that no one of these companies will be operating any more, it is also probable that there isn't any more Finnish state, it can be also possible that there aren't any more Finnish people, it is remote possibility that there are no humans any more. Thus it is obvious that the future can't be controlled.

The only thing that can be done today, by the companies and the state watching them, is to make the best out of it. The nuclear companies paid money into a fund that has collected money to take care of the nuclear waste. This money has been used to build [a repository](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onkalo#Onkalo_waste_repository) 420 meters under the bedrock, used to study and use best materials and practises to dispose the nuclear waste so that it won't leak into the environment not now and not in the future. This is the best solution available.

But lets address this again. The waste is 420 meters down below, in a hard Scandinavian bedrock, even if the waste would leak, the leakage would be local. The damaged area would be in kilometres. Now as horrible as that sounds, that isn't very terrible when you take note that the Finnish soil radiates by nature. After 1000 years the waste radiates as much as the rock where it has been buried.

Now of course this is not a perfect solution, but there isn't any. People who rave about green energy forget CO2 emissions have to be combated today, not tomorrow because there may very well not be tomorrow for the human race due to climate change. And relying on just burning fossil fuels while developing wind and solar is risky business as they may never come to point where they can replace fossil fuels. At least not until it is too late... That is why it is absolutely necessary to have nuclear power, even if it doesn't offer perfect solutions as it works and buys time to work out the problems in the future.",0,1330980647,null,0,false,0,c3xza2m,t3_qfnfj,t1_c3xza2m,t1_c3xu19v,null,1428472386,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I will not even comment on the sex life part.

If you consider that many oil-rich countries are or used to be very unstable, then there is some reason to the conspiracy.

That's actually less freedom than Marx's bourgeoisie-rule, which included 15% of the population. 

The system was so dysfunctional that they twice voted to stop democracy (the people themselves, not the ruling politicians) in the space of a century before they were quickly conquered by the Spartans (Peloponnesian War) and only spared because they didn't bring along a decent-enough military to enforce rule and instead just instituted a formal oligarchy (Athenian Coup of 411). When, a century later, Alexander the Fantastic decided to restart democracy, it was nothing more than a hollow gesture and was quickly done away with when the Romans came and neutered Athens as a city-state.

La différence n'est donc que faiblement technique, elle est principalement cultuelle. Et la loi ne peut pas être faite pour un culte différemment que pour un autre.

La racine de cette polémique remonte aux demandes insistantes d'associations islamiques que les cantines scolaires et les hôpitaux proposent des viandes hallal, et des alternatives systématiques au porc lorsqu'il est au menu.

Les atheistes et catholiques s'en foutent royalement : il n'y a pas de prescription relative aux aliments à consommer (sauf la nourriture maigre du vendredi, d'où le poisson). Les islamiques s'appuient d'ailleurs sur l'habitude culturelle (et non cultuelle, bien qu'elle en soit dérivée par tradition) d'inscrire du poisson aux menus des cantines le vendredi pour légitimer leur campagne.

Le débat est donc biaisé car d'un coté, l'Etat n'a pas a justifier des pratiques culturelles de son peuple, et de l'autre, l'argument en faveur de la viande hallal est infondé car quand bien même on déciderait de tenir compte du problème religieux que ça leur pose, le Coran dit qu'en terre impie, un musulman est dispensé de l'obligation de manger hallal et doit s'accoutumer au régime local. Un état laïc comme la France n'étant pas une république islamique, alors c'est applicable et s'ils respectaient leurs propres textes fondateurs, ils ne devraient même pas le réclamer.

Cependant, le communautarisme ayant pris racine depuis les années 50 et la création des premiers ""ghettos"" en forme de cités HLM, et l'arrivée massive d'immigrants algériens et marocains appelés avant la décolonisation pour aider à la reconstruction, les musulmans ont mis en place tout le nécessaire pour maintenir leurs habitudes alimentaires et ça ne dérangeait personne. La liberté de culte étant acquise, c'était légal et légitime de créer des abattoirs adaptés à leurs coutumes. Libre à eux, dans le domaine privé, de s'approvisionner ou ils le souhaitent.

Ces business d'abattage hallal se sont bien développés et ont supplanté (en efficacité, en coûts, en part de marché) les abattoirs ""standard"" au point qu'il n'y a plus que du hallal en Ile de France, d'après Marine Le Pen

Maintenant, si tu prends un peu de recul, la situation se résume avec les points suivants :

* Un musulman n'a pas d'obligation religieuse a manger hallal en terre impie, donc en France non plus.

* L'état permet à tous d'exercer librement un culte dès lors qu'il ne nuit pas à autrui, et pour l'abattage, qu'il se fait dans le respect des normes sanitaires en vigueur.

* Des musulmans mettent en place la chaîne de production et distribution de viande hallal

* Les islamiques réclament que le hallal soit imposé dans les cantines scolaires et qu'une distinction claire soit faite sur les points de vente

D'un point de vue extérieur, je prends ça de la façon suivante :

* Les musulmans ont monté un business lucratif et essayent de jouer sur la culpabilité liée au communautarisme pour consolider leurs parts de marché

* Les islamiques se servent d'arguments religieux invalides en considérant la France, terre laïque mais de tradition et culture catholique, comme un territoire ou doit s'appliquer la charia

DONC les islamiques bafouent les principes fondateurs de la République Française en faisant valoir un argumentaire religieux ET/OU abusent de cet argumentaire a des fins de profits personnels. Leur donner raison sur un de ces deux points (cantines et étiquetage), c'est renoncer à la laïcité de l'Etat et donner raison aux extrémistes de droite qui crient à l'islamisation galopante du pays.

true,Cayou,ZAFrancophonie,Francophonie,"Merci pour le contexte! J'arrive pas à trouver de sources indiquant que le Coran dispense les fidèles de l'obligation de manger halal lorsqu'ils se trouvent en ""terre impie"", cela dit. Je ne trouve que la sourate 2, verset 173, qui dit que c'est OK quand il n'y a pas d'autre choix, mais il n'y est pas question de territoire.

Dans l'absolu, je pense que tu fais pas mal d'amalgames et de raccourcis, et franchement citer ""Marine Le Pen"" comme source de ton affirmation sur le monopole du Halal en ÎdF, c'est un peu gros. Si on l'écoute, celle-là, la France est la banlieue de la Mecque.

* Si l'État obligeait les vendeurs de viande à indiquer précisément comment l'animal a été abattu, ça ne serait pas une question de religion. La présence d'un Imam n'est qu'une des différences entre un abattage ""traditionnel"" et un abattage halal, une autre est que le boeuf halal n'est pas assomé avant d'être saigné et ce n'est pas une différence négligeable.

* Les islamiques réclament l'imposition du halal dans les cantines ? Qu'ils réclament ! D'autres imbéciles demandent d'autres imbécilités, tant qu'ils ne font que brasser du vent il vaut mieux les ignorer. De toute façon, la question ici est celle de l'étiquetage, pas celle des cantines, faut pas tout mélanger ni tout voir en noir et blanc.

* Je ne vois pas ce que tu veux dire par ""jouer sur la culpabilité liée au communautarisme"", ça m'a l'air tordu ton histoire. Sur le marché de la viande, au final, c'est la libre concurrence qui tranchera, non ?
