true,Philluminati,UKGB,United Kingdom,"In London it's easy to have a one night stand provided you don't have too high standards and you get out and chat to girls. With the right attitude you can meet both girls and guys in clubs, especially in smoking areas. The first thing to say is that White British is a minority and that's obvious. Don't expect to end up bagging an English girl if you're here on holiday. I'm English and I did sleep with a nice Danish girl on holiday here though once.

You probably aren't expected to buy girls drinks either, but it depends on the situation. I find girls hunt in packs with a strong girl and a beta girl. The beta girl is hot but quiet, like gf material, but if you don't entertain the strong girl or leader, she drags the group away. You need a buddy to preoccupy her.

There's a pros/cons. Because I say one night stands happen don't think that:

* Girls will be coming on to you, they won't. You have to put the work in and you have to be prepared for a lot of rejection.
* buying a girl a drink and her wandering off after 30 seconds won't happen. It does, it's her right and it's part of ""the game"". Accept it.

The main skill is to play it cool. There are other guys (usually hotter) who are also ""circulating the room"" so to speak and in an instant they may be lured away. After a few beers and a chat with a pretty girl, it can be infuriating to watch her kissing some other random. Good thing we don't have guns because the jealously for those 5 mins can be hard to deal with on a bad night when you're tanked up.

Truth be told, the best strategy is to put on a nice shirt, not to go out ""looking for it"" (that just ruins an evening) and to go out and just have fun and talk to strangers. Remember ""Easy come, Easy go"" and if it happens, it happens.

After a night that involves swapping numbers or a one night stand you take them on dates. Meal and Drinks. It doesn't have to be expensive (china town and two drinks, you aren't getting her pissed). After the third date you can ask her to be your girlfriend.

Meeting ex work colleagues, meeting friends' work colleagues on a Friday also works as well and is a better approach to meeting a real gf.

Ich verallgemeinere deinen Satz mal: ""In manchen Fällen kann Kausalität über Korrelation festgestellt werden."" Bitte noch etwas ausführen, Links dazu fände ich zusätzlich/alternativ auch interessant - Danke!

In der epidemiologischen Forschung ist Kausalität ein vieldiskutiertes Problem. Ein guter Einstieg ist der Wikipedia-Eintrag von [Sir Austin Bradford Hill](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Bradford_Hill). In der Epidemiologie arbeitet man meist mit Beobachtungsstudien, da experimentale Ansätze dazu, ob zum Beispiel Rauchen Lungenkrebs auslöst, als unethisch verworfen werden. Bei Beobachtungsstudien besteht prinzipiell immer das Problem, dass eine Korrelation dadurch entstehen kann, dass eine gemeinsame Ursache für (die Neigung zum) Rauchen und Lungenkrebs besteht. Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (selbst Raucher) glaubte sehr lange an eine genetische Ursache. Diese Vermutung konnte entkräftet werden, als sich etwa 30 Jahre, nachdem es bei Frauen nicht mehr unschicklich war zu rauchen, auch die Lungenkrebsrate hochging. 

Die andere Möglichkeit ist, den Einfluss in einem Experimentdurch Zufall zu entscheiden. Kopf: Arzneimittel A, Zahl: Arzneimittel B. Jetzt *kann* es keine gemeinsame Ursache für die Wahl des Arzneimittels und den Heilungsverlauf geben, da ich die erste Ursache kenne: Münzwurf, Zufall, *unabhängig von allem*. Natürlich kann es auch sein, dass das Arzneimittel nichts ändert und die Patienten mit besserem Heilungsverlauf alle zufällig in der einen Gruppe gelandet sind. Aber im Gegensatz zu einer möglichen gemeinsamen Ursache *kann ich den Zufall berechnen* und damit numerisch angeben, wie plausibel es ist, dass mir der Zufall einen Effekt vorgaukelt.

IMHO ganz ähnlich zu der Performance eines Tests auf X, die nur abschätzbar ist bei Kenntnis der Wahrscheinlichkeiten von false-positives, false-negatives sowie der tatsächlichen Prävalenz von X in der Bevölkerung.

Ähnlich insofern, als Wahrscheinlichkeiten miteinander multipliziert werden: In einem Fall die relative Rate durch die Behandlung mal der Heilungsrate bei den unbehandelten, im anderen Fall für die Rate der richtig positiven die Sensitivität eines Tests mal die Prävalenz der Krankheit in der Bevölkerung (für den positiven Vorhersagewert, was Du wahrscheinlich mit Performance meinst, brauche ich dann auch die Spezifität, um die Rate der falsch positiven zu bestimmen)

Sonst haben die beiden Konzepte nicht viel miteinander zu tun.

**Italian reality**;

This year, as of November, 105 women in Italy have been killed by husbands or boyfriends.   

Until a few decades ago, murders of women by their partners were treated as crimes of passion in Italy. Perpetrators were often acquitted.  

Domestic rape became a crime just 15 years ago.  

Gender stereotypes are deeply rooted - contributions by Italian men to domestic chores is among the lowest in the world.  

Women on TV are rarely given the chance to speak. In 2006, only 2 percent of women on TV were linked to issues of social commitment and professionalism.

While the EU equalizes the income divide and works to reduce financial mismanagement and corruption in Eastern Europe the Brits see everything as an assault on “the city“; while the EU helps the poorer nations in the union to build infrastructure the Brits, one of the richest nations, complain about being a net contributer.

Okay. I'll start with these sentences. Spelling is wonderful - absolute correct. But there are some misstakes in there which are tough to avoid for non-native speakers.

* ""dazugeben"" means the same as ""hinzufü(ue)gen"" in english. Both can be translated with ""to add"". But a German would instinctevly connect ""dazugeben"" with a cooking recipe. ;) So instead of ""dazugeben"" which really appears a lot in cooking recipes (""Wenn der Teig fertig ist, geben Sie noch einen Liter Milch hinzu."") one should write ""hinzufügen"". But that are some fine details of German...

* In written German you wouldn't leave the object of the sentence away. So you would write ""Meine Tastatur hat keine Umlaute."".

* ""Verzeiht mich."" There is the tricky part. Mir or mich. In this case, it is ""jemande**m** verzeihen"", so it is a dative-object. That's why there has to be ""mir"". In case there is an accusative-object, one would write mich: ""jemande**n** lieben"" would be ""Liebst Du mich?"". So correct would be ""Verzeiht mir.""

*So! Ich bin ein Amerikanerin, und ich habe in die Hochschule und in die Universitaet Deutsche studiert. Ich habe, uh, alles vergessen. Alles.*

* In English it is quite common to start sentences with ""So!"". In written German it is not. You can replace it by ""Also"": ""Also ich bin eine Amerikanerin...""

* The next tricky part for non-native speakers are the articles. In this case, ""Hochschule"" und ""Universitä(ae)"" are female (Don't ask me why :D). And since you've got the preposition ""in"" right before these two words, you have to look which case follows. In this case, the dative case follows, which means you have to change the article ""die"" into ""der"".

* The only spelling mistake I could find is that you wrote ""Deutsche"". It has to be ""Deutsch"". Because there is no plural to our language ;).



*Ich liege offensichtlich, aber ich moechte meine Deutsche Geschicke bessern. Wegen dieser mache ich dies Blog. Ich bin nicht lustig.*

* I guess you translated the first sentence directly from English. Unfortunatley, the translator translated ""lying (to tell a lie)"" as ""lying (in a bed)"". :D Correct would be ""Ich lüge offensichtlich"".

* ""Deutsche Geschicke"" is very very uncommon. You can avoid this very simple. Simply write ""Ich möchte mein Deutsch verbessern."" which means ""I want to improve my German."". 

* ""Wegen dieser"" is also very uncommon in this context. Replace it with ""Deswegen"".

* ""Blog"" is male or neutral in German. If you ask why... well seems we don't really know how to translate english words and give them a proper gender... ;). Der Blog or das Blog would be correct. So you'd have to write ""diesen Blog (m.)"" or ""dieses Blog (n.).""

* ""Ich bin nicht lustig."" Well, I apologize, but I had to giggle. Translated back into English it would be. ""I'm not funny."". But I guess, you wanted to write something. ""I'm not kidding."". This would be ""Ich mache keinen Spaß.""

UNITED KINGDOM

which one can find here,

http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:0156:0157:EN:PDF

We have article one that says,

""Article 1
1. The Charter does not extend the ability of the Court of Justice of the European Union, or any court or tribunal of
Poland or of the United Kingdom, to find that the laws, regulations or administrative provisions, practices or action of
Poland or of the United Kingdom are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, freedoms and principles that it reaffirms.""

Which on any true reading means Europe can't nix anything the UK does.

OK, the UK may let a lot go by the by in the interest of making its net contribution to the EU but the UK has the final say in the UK.

I'm surprised Europe gave us that really but there we are.

So, the study I linked in my comment doesn't rhyme with reality (the reality I live in), but the study you refer to does?

Your source is dated 15 June, but you say that:
&gt;This year, as of November, 105 women in Italy have been killed by husbands or boyfriends.

Well, you obviously have another source you are not linking.

&gt;Domestic rape became a crime just 15 years ago.

You're right, but you deliberately omit the fact that a woman could still denounce her husband as he committed an act of violence against her person. It just wasn't clear, and the 1996 law improved the legislation on the matter. As I said in the previous comment, Italy has a problem related to domestic violence, but I can assure you that this priest is not expressing a *common Italian sentiment*.

&gt;Gender stereotypes are deeply rooted - contributions by Italian men to domestic chores is among the lowest in the world

This is quickly changing as the new generations take over. All of my friend of my same age (25-30) share the housekeeping duties with their partner. My grandfather doesn't even know how to cook a scrambled egg, but my father cooks for the family and cleans the house.

&gt;Women on TV are rarely given the chance to speak. In 2006, only 2 percent of women on TV were linked to issues of social commitment and professionalism.

That's just plain false. Only by watching the Berlusconi's channels you would see a much higher percentage, so imagine what the total percentage is. 

The problem here is that you probably refer to an ISTAT survey made in **2006**. In the meantime, things have changed for the better.

The sole fact that you, here, are reading a news about a priest making those declarations is because of the outrage caused by him in Italy. 
I went to a Catholic school for 15 years and I can say that the reality inside the church is much different from the outside.

You're right, but you deliberately omit the fact that a woman could still denounce her husband as he committed an act of violence against her person. It just wasn't clear,   

Women could *denounce* their husbands?   
You can see the problem with this, can't you, especially if the law wasn't clear?   
Perhaps you have not beaten your girlfriend, and your dad never raped or beaten your mom, and you even do the dishes in your homes -  but, when one in every three Italian women experience domestic violence, it is a common (as frequent) occurrence. Should we think that these men beat and rape the women in their lives, but don't share the views that the women are to blame? That they use violence but think it's not OK?   

Anyway.

I'm sorry that you feel my comment, or the report itself, is a direct affront to you. 
 
I should have left links. The quotes are from reports of the press conference held by the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women in June.   
Most from Wideplus  (European Network around women’s rights and development) and NPR. The quote about women on Italian TV came from NPR, and they got it from the report itself.

Encouraging other nations to seek a relationship with the EU that they are comfortable with is precisely what Britain should do.

We should to fight to create an EU that does not force smaller nations into ever-closer-union as the only way to have any influence over their destiny.

To use Britain’s size to carve out a template for a sovereign nation-state within the single market, that can be adopted by other EU nations if the prospect of a federal union within europe is unpalatable for them too.

In a section of Youth Defence‘s Magazine ‘Solas‘(yes they can afford to publish a magazine with all their funds) Ms Bhriain stated that people should oppose Marriage Equality and Civil Partnership because it “endangers the children of the state and undermines their safety” and that it does not allow for ”conscientious objection for anyone with a moral obligation“.

Youth Defence is one of a small number of catholic lobby groups based in the same office in Capel Street, and with the same directors, and using the same facilites. Some of the others are The Life Institute, Mother and Child Campaign, etc. They are all opposed to same sex marriage.

&gt; What do you mean taught about 'gay sex'? They're already taught about sex in general not just straight sex(I got taught both even in a catholic school)

It's a common anti-gay propaganda to claim that children will be converted to gayness if we allow any gay rights and OH WON'T SOMEONE THINK OF THE CHILDREN.

For example, during the California referendum (""Prop 8""), ""they'll teach your kids to be gay!!!!1one"" was used to claim you should vote against same sex marriage ( example: http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/19/local/me-gayschools19 (the prop8 stuff is confusing, because ""yes"" meant ""yes, ban same sex marriage"", and ""no"" meant ""no, don't ban same sex marriage""  ).

Any people who have been mistreated for an extended period of time are likely to turn to extremism. Indeed, Israel is the perfect example.

People turn to extremism out of fear and injustice. In this situation, the injustice is one-sided. We can and should, at the very least, work to end the injustices. Only then can we tackle the mutual fear.

&gt; I think a two state solution might be impossible, and the best thing to do is adopt the situation and work towards a better future together.

A one-state solution could work if it is a balanced, secular state. How more or less likely the two sides are to accept this is open to much debate :)

A two-state solution is possible when *both* sides are forced to accept it. Israel will never accept it all the while that it has unwavering and unconditional support from other nations. Hence this post.

And I am pretty sure they will get the haircut, because the debt level of Greece is simply to high. Greece will need to do a few more reform to win a bit more trust and also have to wait till Germany have elected a new/old Chancellor, because I can't see Merkel ruining her chance to get reelected.

Similarly, most cases of rape (91.6 per cent) are not reported to the police.

true,Snoxhall,null,null,"Shotguns are very common for both sporting and hunting. Most of them are 2-shot versions.

Every sporting shooter has to have a license before buying any gun. It is checked by the authorities whether this type of gun is suitable for sporting. 

Buying ammo is tied to the respective gun (for sporting shhooters), i.e. you can buy only ammunition for your gun(s).

It is similar with regard to handguns owned by hunters. The normal limit is 2 handguns per hunter (there can be exceptions if you are a sport shooter too).

Long guns (rifles, shotguns, semi-auto versions of both) are very easy to obtain for a hunter. You can go to a gunshop and buy basically any (long) gun you want, including ""assault rifles/weapons"".

After the purchase, you have to get your new gun licensed. This works very well, because the dealer sends a letter to the respective authorities stating that customer x with gun license Y has bought gun Z. If you don't do this, you will get into trouble and probably loose your license.

My post is already long but here some additional informations:
1. Hunters are in fact unlimited in the number of long guns, but as you can only use one at a time, I don't think this is dangerous.

2. semi auto rifles (used in shooting sprees) are limited to 10 (shooters) respective 2 (hunters) round magazines. Higher capacity magazines can be bought nonetheless. You will loose your license if someone finds out.

3. hunters can buy any ammunition they want.

4. permissions for concealed carry (Waffenschein) are extremely rare, almost no gun owner is allowed to carry his guns, they can onle transport them unloaded and locked.

5. laws regarding the fitness for owning guns (Zuverlässigkeit) are strict: If you are arrested while driving drunk, you can loose your license. The same goes for convictions of any violent kind or regarding drugs.

If you have further questions, feel free to ask. My response will probably take some time, I am very busy.

The fact he is not even a resident in the UK and his nation benifits enormously from trade with the UK it is of no suprise he would see the UK leaving as a threat.

This talk about the Uk becoming insignificant and like ""norway or switzerland"" is not only simply factually wrong but also pathetic scaremongering of which the majority of educated British can see as hollow.

The UK has a population of around 70,000,000, a GDP of over 2 Trillion, an armed force numbering in the hundreds of thousands and a nuclear arsenal of over 250 warheads... the UK is in no way ""insignificant"".

The UK not being part of the EU would descent in its apparent ""power"", but this is something the British fully understand and desire, we dont want to be an all powerful nation just have a high quality of freedom to interact with the world and our commowealth allies again.

Prehaps one day we may form a commonwealth trade union or commonwealth economic union. We have good ties with India, Australia, Canada all of which are growing exponentially economically and of which already co-operate significantly without the UKs participation.

Maybe this is the real threat the EU fears, the fact that the UK may succeed outside the EU beyond what they could offer us laying the path for other nations to leave the EU.

Correlation only in the sense that with a N pairs of (x,y) values, you can find an order N-1 polynom that fits them. Direct would mean a dominant linear or low power polynomial relationship, which clearly isn't there. 

We can easily construct extreme anecdotes that imply a causation. My favorite: when people unload their troubles with a neighbour, throw in a ""in the US, he has a gun.""

However, the data strongly suggests that gun ownership is not the primary factor, and other factors have a higher influence. Which is why discussing gun ownership rate is likely not the best approach to reduce homicide rates.

true,SchindetNemo,ASTR,Austria,"Short answer: Carinthia is our Texas. 

Long answer: Carinthia used to be part of a slavic principality  until it was conquered by  Charlemagne in the 8th century AD and colonised by ethnic Germans until the Slavs were completely  replaced by the 13th century. 

After the Austrian defeat in the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon formed the Kingdom of Illyria which resembled the ancient Slavic principality and included German Carinthia and Styria to weaken the Habsburgs,  but had the unfortunate side effect of  rekindling ancient rivalries and claims for the land.

Now, when  the break-up of the crumbling Habsburg monarchy was imminent after WW1, the ethnic German parts split from Illyria and asked to be annexed by the newly formed Austrian republic. The Slovenes weren't very fond of that unfortunately and decided to invade and take the lands by force. Since the Austrian army was busy with a little civil war we had going on at the time and Carinthia wasn't yet part of the country, the population had to fight a bloody guerilla war to fend of the Slavs.

This event has burned itself into the collective memory of Carinthians and influenced their politics ever since. 

Fuelled by the recent events Carinthians grew increasingly xenophobic and racist. Unsurprisingly, they were very eager to adopt Hitler's new racial doctrines. When he finally took over, he had overwhelming support in the state. 
Around this time the state started to try to suppress  the identity of Austrian Slovenes. The pseudo ethnicity of ""Windisch"" was created along with the ""windish language"" so Austrian Slovenes won't associate themselves with other Slavs in the hopes that the minority will assimilate completely and simply vanish.

Unfortunately this xenophobic trend didn't stop after the Second World War. Instead of purging the openly racist people on top, they mass emigrated to the Social Democratic party and simply continued where they've left off.

While the second Austrian Republic reintroduced the old constitutional rights for minorities, the state of Carinthia refused to follow along. The first Landeshauptmann (think American governor) proudly proclaimed that Carinthia is nationalist first and socialist second and simply ignored all orders. Bi lingual schools were closed down, bi lingual government papers were never issued and people speaking ""windisch"" were heavily discriminated against, for example if you wanted to name your kid ""Matjaž"" civil servants refused to hand out a birth certificate unless you registered your son as a properly germanised ""Matthias"". Hell, that guy even founded a successor organisation to the Hitler Youth.

Because the federal Social Democrats were constantly criticising their Carinthian sub faction and the Federal Republic generally became too friendly with foreigners  during the mid 80s one now infamous Carinthian named Jörg Haider took over a liberal democratic party and turned it into a right wing populist party so they could continue to openly spout their xenophobia, which now included muslims and brown people, without any repercussions. 

And this is the reason why Carinthains get so much shit from other Austrians. Carinthia is a beautiful state ruined by old people who can't get over something that happened 90 years ago. The state is still extremely xenophobic and Austrian Slovenes are still discriminated against. Politicians down there are stuck in the past. It's so absurd that other Austrians make fun of Carinthians  whenever they meet one.  

The situation is getting better though. The 20+ generation doesn't give a shit about any of that.

I know you're angry because people cheat and I've acknowledged that they're at fault morally.. But it has happened, and now we are in this situation: playing the blame game doesn't improve the situation in any way. There's a hole in the roof, and a storm is brewing. Would you rather fix it or argue about whose fault it is?

&gt;Proof please. Is Estonia far better off than Latvia, Lithuania due to the Euro? Doubt it.

That's impossible to prove or disprove, because we have to choose to do either and we can't experiment.

&gt;No, they were not

So, what should have happened?

&gt;If the countries had stuck to them, it wouldn't have been so bad.

If my mother-in-law had wings and a good attitude, she would be an angel. The fact is, she isn't. How am I going to live with it? For the euro, we're going to have to live with the situation as it has developed. What should happen now?

&gt;Also, perhaps it would have been better for Greece as well. Yes, they would have been thrown out (or never let in in the first place)of the Euro, but they would have had real chances of growth, planning their own finances etc. Now they seem to be angry at everyone but themselves.

If they were thrown out, speculation against any European countries would never cease. It would raise financial costs for everyone in the long run.

&gt;Besides, you are dodging the question. Is this democratic? How can you defend the non-democratic behaviour? The people of the EU has voted about these rules. They said yes to the Euro under certain circumstances. If they are changing the rules, one need to ask again. One can't just keep breaking them, ignoring them, for eternity? That is appallingly un-democratic, and I can't even begin to understand why you encourage and defend no democratic behaviour.

The rules don't mention anything about circumstances like this. The rules don't even provide the possibility for a country to leave the eurozone. So it was up to the elected representatives of these people to improvise in unexpected circumstances: that's what they're elected for.

&gt;as you can tell, I have millions of arguments against the Euro.

Correction: a million beliefs, which are so vague that they can never be proven or disproven.

&gt;It is a lot for them, and the fact is, it is not your, or anyone elses choice to make. They were supposed to pay nothing. And, please know that they are poorer than the Greeks. Why should they pay anything. What on earth have they done?

Apparently they think the benefits of the euro outweigh the costs.

&gt;Stop voting for corrupt idiots. Admit that they have been voting for corrupt idiots for decades because it has suited them.

Hey, you were complaining about ""non-democratic"" behaviour above, and now you're the one dictating the people who they should vote for?

&gt;Start doing what they have promised to do (like for example fulfill the conditions of the first bailout).

Apparently it's not so simple to do that. You just assume that it's because of bad faith.

&gt;start using financial common sense, like start taxing their shipping industry

""The government of Greece has signed a memorandum of understanding with the shipping industry over a new cargo tax, in the expectation that the measure will raise EUR200m (USD260m) by 2016.
Greek governments have historically been fearful of taxing the shipping industry, in case companies simply relocated abroad, and industry figures in June warned against left-wing opposition plans to end tax breaks. However, the head of the Hellenic Shipowners’ Association, Theodoros Veniamis, has said that shippers are willing to pay tax as a contribution to the national effort to deal with the country’s financial troubles.""

There, happy?

&gt;Start paying taxes.

Most of the problem lies with 15000 people. They're listed and studied, but a democratic state can't seize their citizens' assets at a whim.

&gt;stop paying stupid pensions to public employees

Yeah, let them beg. That'll really motivate the people working as tax inspector.

Maybe Gerard Depardieu gets to much money out of the system, but not all the actors. I must honestly say that I don not know much about the french cultural system, but about the German, and I must say, damn, those people are some poor bastards. Actors are payed to much? Maybe some. 1 in 1000 maybe. 

Culture (as the french cinema, that by the way is highly appreciated all around the world) is funded by the state not because the state needs to get rid of the money. But because it is important. To create a cultural identity, to create discussions and because culture is a economical branch that is very important. And besides that it feds rich actors it provides a lot of people with jobs. Not to speak of the fact that other economical branches profit of the cultural events- people who go to the cinema eat, drink, use public transportation, discover shops in areas they would not have frequented otherwise. 

So, is the french cinema overfunded? Need there to be other ways of financing? Probalbly. But as I see it this is an article that does not seek for other ways of financing that still keep the system running but to cut down these financial helps and see this economical branch cope with the consequences.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;Loans, that Greece take to the full price of the market, that doesn't cost other countries tax payers a single dime

That would mean bankruptcy, and bankruptcy means that 
1. the Greek government collapses. That would mean that most of education, healthcare, solidarity etc. can't be run anymore for lack of funds. That will impoverish them permanently.
2. the euro will be seen as a weak currency, raising interest rates for everyone else
3. the banks and institutions that loaned to Greece will face severe problems. They will need help or go bust, either way, combined with 2 that will result in even more governmental defaults, until all the dominoes have fallen.

Bottom line: the whole of Europe will be set back, millions of people will be permanently impoverished. But at least we've been able to take revenge on the Greeks, that's worth any price!

&gt;You do know one doesn't have to prove a negative? As in, prove there is no God?

Then why should I prove that countries are not better off outside of the euro? Go argue semantics elsewhere.

&gt;But fine, be a child then. Here is Sweden's financial information. In the GDP growth for example, I choose 2001- 2011 - here. Here is the same information for Finland here. Could you please point to me how Finland is better off with the Euro?

That doesn't prove anything either way. What you should compare is Finland without the Euro in 2001-2011 and Finland with the Euro in 2001-2011. Or the same for Sweden.

&gt;I don't like our fincial system either, but it is not a reason or an excuse to cheat for Greece, or to make other countries pay for them. Belgium for example has fucked up too, but at least they don't ask other countries tax payers to pay for them. We aare all part of the same system, yet Greeks are the ones who need to be bailed out all the time. What makes them so special?

The urgency of the case. If the house is on fire, you don't argue about who left the candles on. You try to get the people out of the house, instead of trying to find out if some of them might be to blame or not.

In addition, their de facto status as a test case for the willingness of the EU countries to back up the stability of the European economy with actions rather than words.

&gt;Oh, the poor poor Greeks again. Their is absolutely no possibility, in the last four five years that they could start taxing their shipping for example. Of course the Greeks can't start to use computerized records, or actually fire the people they said they were going to fire in the first bailout. Poor, poor Greeks. We will just have to wait and pay them, until the Greeks decide they can do those things. Or they could man up and start to change and doing the things they promised to do in the first place. But they are not.

As a matter of fact, they are doing all these things. But not everyone demands instant gratification like you and realizes that changing things in a non-superficial way does not happen instantly. Not outside of fairytales in any case.

&gt;Have you been there? They do not want to go back to communism.

Currently not, but there are still communist parties in all of them. As soon as times go bad, people will look for alternatives. If times go sufficiently bad, they will look for *any* alternative and take what is available.

&gt;The people of Estonia choose not to cheat.

If your child is sick, and the doctor asks a bribe, what do you do?

&gt;Those decades of prosperity you are talking about, they happened in Greece to, 

Their circumstances of life are improving, they have much better prospects than Greece.

&gt;and they have been a free country much, much longer btw

19 years.

&gt;Should every single country be able to do that, ignore treaties and agreements, or is that a special provision you make for Greece?

Tell me exactly what the treaty says that should happen with countries that violate the rules.

&gt;That is still no reason tu succumb to threats, and yes, I do assume those things happen because they want to. Do you mean for example that the rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is because people do not want them. Of course they do, even though they are not very democratic, the people of Egypt are voting for them. Their choice. If the Greeks choose to go down that path, it will be their own doing, and their own path. Do not even dare to blame that on Europe, Finland, Sweden or anyone else. EU will deal with it then, but the EU can not pay for Greece for or eternity, since otherwise we will become fascist.. That is blackmail

You sorely overestimate the amount of control individual people have over the political situation in their country. In addition, you just ignore what I say and repeat your rant about blackmail. I'll repeat it: **It's not a threat. It's what likely will happen. We do not want that to happen because it's disadvantageous to us. Therefore we will do what is needed to prevent it.**

&gt;Again, that is a) if they choose to become a dictatorship b) then they will have to leave the EU btw, and c) is the EU willing to intervene after that?

Are you an imbecile, or do you just pretend to be? THEIR INTENTION DOES NOT MATTER, THE RESULTS ARE THE SAME. Of course the EU and the NATO will intervene, they can't let stuff like that happen in their backyard. As opposed to you, who would likely chicken out when the going gets tough.

&gt;Yes, I do know that. Unlike you I suspect, I have been in Ruwanda

Yeah, and I've been on Saturnus. Come on bloke, you can't even spell it consistently.

&gt;To say however, that there is no use helping them, because they will die of something else anyway, is a horrible attitude.

It's like saying that the Greeks are so corrupt, it's no use helping them. Except that you believe that the Greeks are evil and corrupt and always will be, while I'm merely pointing out that AIDS medicines on their own mostly serve to soothe your conscience, rather than fundamentally improving the situation there. If you really had been in Rwanda, you would be able to take the racist talk about the inborn corruptness of the Greeks with a grain of salt.

&gt;ou however, keep claiming that the EU, IMF etc have nothing more important to do than to help out the Greeks.

Cite me where I did that.

&gt;I propose a vote among the tax payers of Europe. Do you want to keep paying for the Greeks with your money, or not? Who do you think will win?

The pro-Euro camp. In particular because you, as the citizen of a non-eurozone country, have jack shit to do with the eurozone. Oh wait, the other European governments *did* ask to have their say in Eurozone matters? How can that be, weren't they happily doing their own finances? Apparently their economies aren't as separate as they claimed they were. Apparently they have been enjoying the benefits of a large European core too. Apparently they have been free riding on the efforts of the Eurozone countries so far, but they're only coming to weasel back in now that these efforts were going to be formalized and start to have a bigger influence.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; But at least we've been able to take revenge on the Greeks, that's worth any price!

First - you are confusing revenge with taking responsibility. If I  refuse to pay my rent, since I think it is better spent on strippers, and the landlord throws me out - are you saying it is revenge  from the landlord? Why, I didn't pay. It is not vengeful to want your money back, or not wanting to pay for someone else.

Letting a country and its people take its responsibility is *not* the same thing as revenge. Revenge for what? Not paying off *someone else's* debt, is not revenge ?Do you mean that as soon as one does not pay off someone else's debt, it is automatically revenge? Could you expand upon that? So, are we vengeful for not paying off Argentina's and Iceland's debt? Japan's? Belgium and Italy perhaps? Don't you think the one talking the loans and not paying them back is the one responsible? I mean, the Greeks are not stupid, they are as smart (or idiotic) as the rest of us - they made a choice. 

I am proposing that they take responsibility for their actions - just like I propose that the fictiv me who spent all my  rent money on strippers, is not the victim of an evil landlord - I even think the landlord is correct. 

&gt;the banks and institutions that loaned to Greece will face severe problems. They will need help or go bust, either way, combined with 2 that will result in even more governmental defaults, until all the dominoes have falle

Frankly, most of that debt have already been transferred to other countries taxpayers. Have you missed all the talk about fire walls. Greece's problem is now much more contained to Greece.
It does not mean that Italy will fall, or Germany, which you seem to claim. Could you back that claim up with something? Will a Greek default be fun - certainly not, but there is no reason for the doom and gloom that you are portraying. Why, Greece might fall to the level of Estonia, the horror. Had Greece been allowed to default, it could be well on its way to recovery now. 

&gt;That doesn't prove anything either way. What you should compare is Finland without the Euro in 2001-2011 and Finland with the Euro in 2001-2011. Or the same for Sweden.

Good, I found someone who did just that (or, 1999-2011, to be exact). They have concluded that while Finland benefitted somewhat from it initially (the export would have been 6 % smaller during the IT-bubble if they hadn't been a member) that would have been offset by more stable and rising exports later on. Also, they would have recovered a lot fast from the 2008-2009 crises were they not member of the Euro, like Sweden did. They are discussing leaving, but that is a whole different ball game, and might not benefit. However, your claim that Finland have benefitted more from being in the Euro, than outside is incorrect.

[Here](http://gnseconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Finland-and-the-EMU-gns.pdf) is the report of course, very interesting. Could you tell me why it is wrong, since you claim that it is? I'd like some links please to credible reports, articles etc. Don't worry about access, I am at the university, and as such I have access to (almost) all academic journals.

[Here](http://articles.businessinsider.com/2010-12-21/markets/30039109_1_market-share-finland-euro-membership) is also a a reference to report from Societe General about countries that would benefit from leaving the Euro (Italy, Ireland, Finland)

[Here](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-07-15/why-italy-has-the-most-reason-to-quit-the-euro) is another report from Merrill Lynch, that says Italy

&gt;Then why should I prove that countries are not better off outside of the euro? Go argue semantics elsewhere.

What? So you have put yourself in the comfortable position that you never ever have to prove anything? You have made a claim, but you are not willing to back it up?  Are you saying that you can't prove that the Euro is successfull? I'd think with at least 10 years of data, that would be an easy task. I think you are not backing it up, because you can't, and you know it. 

&gt;As a matter of fact, they are doing all these things. But not everyone demands instant gratification like you and realizes that changing things in a non-superficial way does not happen instantly. Not outside of fairytales in any case.

No, they are not. They have not fired the people they promised to fire from the first bailout, not have they started to tax shipping for example. They are *thinking* about it [Link](http://greece.greekreporter.com/2012/10/26/greece-eyes-cargo-tax-on-shipping/). They have also asked them to voluntarily come up with some cash, but no, they are not taxing them yet. 

&gt;Currently not, but there are still communist parties in all of them. As soon as times go bad, people will look for alternatives. If times go sufficiently bad, they will look for any alternative and take what is available.

Doubt it, our populistic parties in Western Europe, like in Denmark, the Netherlands etc have more influence than the communists. And we are richer, we should be ashamed.

&gt;Their circumstances of life are improving, they have much better prospects than Greece.

They are improving more, because they were way further down. Compare Greece in 1992, to Estonia in 1992. I admit, the Baltic states have come a long way, but they are still poorer than Greece. And, what have Greece been doing in the last 20 years? 

&gt;Tell me exactly what the treaty says that should happen with countries that violate the rules.

That has been a problem the lack of punishment, but that is not an excuse for breaking the rules. Do you think that there is? Nothing  happens to you most of the time if you break the Kyoto agreement, but you are still an ass if you do. And, the fact is that *they* broke the treaty, doesn't mean that everyone else has to. To illustrate - just because Portugal needs money, doesn't mean that the *ECB* should bend it's rules, or any other country. The punbishments that I know are as far, fines for countries breaking the rules, and nothing more. But, that also mean that one is not punishing a country if one chooses not to support them. In other words - not paying for Greece's debt, is not a punishment (which you might claim), but just following the rules. Had they done that, Greece would have defaulted as well. And of course, fine all the Eurozone countries that haven't followed the rules, which I believe is everybody, but Estonia and Finland.


&gt;You sorely overestimate the amount of control individual people have over the political situation in their country. In addition, you just ignore what I say and repeat your rant about blackmail. I'll repeat it: It's not a threat. It's what likely will happen. We do not want that to happen because it's disadvantageous to us. Therefore we will do what is needed to prevent it.

It is not *likely*. It is what you think will happen, and yes, you are using it as a threat. Countries have had it much worse (and are having it much worse, right here in Europe) without turning to fascism. It is odd that you think the Greeks are so super swell victims, who, as soon as they don't get it their way, will turn to fascism. 

&gt;Yeah, and I've been on Saturnus. Come on bloke, you can't even spell it consistently.

I am Swedish, English is my second language. I often make spelling mistakes. In Swedish we spell it Rwanda. I have visisted my cousin when she was there, who works for SIDA in Africa(Swedish International Development Agency). I am also not a bloke. Fuck you for calling me a liar. 

&gt;It's like saying that the Greeks are so corrupt, it's no use helping them. Except that you believe that the Greeks are evil and corrupt and always will be, while I'm merely pointing out that AIDS medicines on their own mostly serve to soothe your conscience, rather than fundamentally improving the situation there. If you really had been in Rwanda, you would be able to take the racist talk about the inborn corruptness of the Greeks with a grain of salt

Where have I written that the Greeks are evil? And where have I written that the corruption is inborn? And, apparently you know nothing about the effectivness of HIV medicine. It prevent people from dying, you moron, so they get a chance to raise their children. It also lessens the risk of spreading it to other people.  I could write so much about that, and link to extremely credible studies, but you are a racist, and don't care if African people dies. 

&gt;If your child is sick, and the doctor asks a bribe, what do you do?

Yes, all the bribes paid the last five years in Greece has been to doctors, paid by parents to sick children. Now, I call you a liar.

&gt;The pro-Euro camp. In particular because you, as the citizen of a non-eurozone country, have jack shit to do with the eurozone.

There are 25 out of 27 countries who has agreed to follow the rules of the Euro. So, as long as we are concerned, and also are paying for it (throught the EU, throught the IMF, and just through country giving money to another country, that is messed up because of the Euro - like UK and Sweden to Ireland for example) we should get a vote.

Above all, if you care at all about democracy, you should think it is valid that people got to vote about things that truly concers them, the citizens of Greece of course, but also Germans, Finns etc. After all, the rules have been changed, without a vote. That has, of course, to be rectified. 

&gt;How can that be, weren't they happily doing their own finances

? Apperently you are wrong, if we wanted to be more intvined, we would have accepted the banking union, or why not the FTT. We didn't. 


&gt;Do you really think a union can work if any member that has to do a slightly bigger effort than usual chickens out? In good days and bad days, not only when the weather is fair.

Do you think a union can work if one ignore democracy, rules and regulations? Let the people vote about the new rules to the Euro, and the ECB. Let them vote if they want to be responible for another countries debt. You have no right, just to throw it upon them.

""Then Posen’s defense became more technical. He said the problem wasn’t a sudden collapse in the capacity of workers and factories. The problem, more simply, was that there wasn’t enough demand to support full production. The private sector, in other words, was no longer able or willing to spend enough money for the economy to function at its peak levels. If the government or Bank of England could do more to stimulate the economy through any number of tools at their disposal — like more quantitative easing and infrastructure spending — demand would rise, and everyone’s productivity would shoot back to normal. ""

One of the reasons private sector in the UK is not willing or able to spend enough money in increased production is the uncertainty created by British policymakers towards the relationship of Britain with the EU. People from inside and outside Britain will not invest in Britain to set up businesses which are based on exports to other markets as long as Britain's relationship to the (rest of) the EU isn't cleared up. It's just too much of a risk compared to investing in markets which are more consistent in their policies like the US. The non-UK part of the EU will also have a consistent policy as long as the socialist tendencies of France can be kept in check by Germany and the rest.
Basically Britain will have to choose: have a relatively autarkian economy or integrate with the rest of the world, to begin with with the EU.",0,1356773393,null,0,false,0,c7nqf6w,t3_15iuww,t1_c7nqf6w,t3_15iuww,null,1435652726,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I know you're angry because people cheat and I've acknowledged that they're at fault morally.. But it has happened, and now we are in this situation: playing the blame game doesn't improve the situation in any way. There's a hole in the roof, and a storm is brewing. Would you rather fix it or argue about whose fault it is?

It is just not the Greeks, it is the whole bloody union. It is one thing if the Greeks cheat, and they get to take the consequences of their actions, but they do not get to do that. They are getting their debt paid by other people for example, how bad of a consequence is that. Also, what is far more important is that the restof the union start ignoring democracy even more. Follow the rules goddammit. One does not have the right, without voting, to take on other countries debt. And, to demand that other countries who doesn't even want to, do that. 

Also, I don't exactly see the Greeks on this site, or anywhere else, standing up and admitting they themselves fucked up, super royally. All I see is complain about austerity. To fix something, one has to admit one was wrong in the first place, but Greece doesn't seem to do that. If they truly want to change, why haven't they fulfilled the agreements from the *first* bailout even. Also, it comes down to other countries and institutions as well. ECB is not serving anyone, by not following the rules. Whatever it is, it is not democracy, and that is way more dangerous than any default will be.

The Euro crises is killing democracy, and that is horrible, and no one (not you either, it seems) is one bit interested in fixing it. If they were, they would stop and say ""Wait"", democracy is important, we can't just re-write things. Yes, Greece may fall, but we can't ignore the mandate we have from hundred of millions of Europan citizens to actually stand up for the rules, the treaties etc"". It is when times are tough, democracy get tested, and the EU have failed, catastrophically. I don't see anyone taking responsibility for that, do you. 


&gt;That's impossible to prove or disprove, because we have to choose to do either and we can't experiment.

What? One can compare similar economies, just like in the Finland Sweden study and draw conclusions from that. Of course one can find studies about that. 

&gt;So, what should have happened?

Letting Greece default, for one thing.

&gt;If they were thrown out, speculation against any European countries would never cease. It would raise financial costs for everyone in the long run.

No, that is not necessary. I am from a small country who had the market speculate us a lot of times (the 1992 crises for example, when the interest rate were 500 % (!!!!) and the krona lost 25 % of its value). Yet, we survived, and in the end it made us stronger, with a better economy for it. If Sweden can survive, what on earth says that the Eurozone, who is a lot bigger, stronger etc, can't. 

&gt;The rules don't mention anything about circumstances like this. The rules don't even provide the possibility for a country to leave the eurozone. So it was up to the elected representatives of these people to improvise in unexpected circumstances: that's what they're elected for.

No, the rules *do* mention it. They say ""each country is responsible for their own debt"", ""no country should pay for anyone else's etc"" The politicians, and the *non-elected bureacrats of the ECB* do not have a mandate to override the rules that the European people agree upon. It is when times are hard, that it is more important than ever to stick to the democratic rules. We can't just abandon them. 

Are you saying that is what one should do? Ignore democracy every time it gets tough?

There were votes about this, arguments, debates. The rules are there for a reason, to be respected and followed. 

Otherwise, it the EU do not follow important rules, what it is? Certainly not a democracy, and certainly not a union.

&gt;Correction: a million beliefs, which are so vague that they can never be proven or disproven.

Sigh, it was a figure of speach. But OK, a few argument against the Euro that you can prove or disprove is that the economies are to different to be brought together. One interest rate doesn't work for all the countries (I think the recent years have proven me right), that a financial union of this size can't happen without permanent financial transfers (who are oddly, beginning to happen), that Sweden's interest aren't (obviously) always the same as that of the big Euro countries who are the ones who set the tone, and they are not at all interested in looking out for us, that one need to have stricter rules and to enforce them too (I think I am right about that one as well, don't you)

&gt;ey, you were complaining about ""non-democratic"" behaviour above, and now you're the one dictating the people who they should vote for?

No, I said that is what they should do. I am also saying that smokers should stop smoking. I am not enforcing it, I am not planning to invade Greece, but I do wish they would start talking responsibility.

&gt;Apparently it's not so simple to do that. You just assume that it's because of bad faith.

So, why, exactly please, can't they fulfill the *what they promised to do* from the first bailout. You know, other countries, like Portugal, Spain and Ireland have all received help too, but they are managing to do, to a much larger degree, what they say they are going to do. Why can't the Greeks do that?What makes the Greek so unique, that unlike Portugal, Ireland etc, *they* can't do it, although other countries can. 

&gt;""The government of Greece has signed a memorandum of understanding with the shipping industry over a new cargo tax, in the expectation that the measure will raise EUR200m (USD260m) by 2016. Greek governments have historically been fearful of taxing the shipping industry, in case companies simply relocated abroad, and industry figures in June warned against left-wing opposition plans to end tax breaks. However, the head of the Hellenic Shipowners’ Association, Theodoros Veniamis, has said that shippers are willing to pay tax as a contribution to the national effort to deal with the country’s financial troubles.""

Link please (nevermind, I found it, but in the future, if one quotes, it is customary to provide links). When I read about it, it says that they are starting to think about it, but haven't implemented it, and it is due to the pressure from the Troijka, not from the Greeks.  In my comparison to not taxing the forrest industy of Sweden, which I guess is the equialent, this shocks me. How on earth can they be such openly cowards about it. [here](http://www.lowtax.net/lowtax/html/offon/greece/gressm.html) is an article I uncovered in my search btw, on how extremely favourable it was for the Greek shipping industry. It is disgusting, and it was singled out by the EU as early as 2006 as a harmful tax practise. Not that they cared then. I also honestly think, like they say in this article from Der Spiegel [Link](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/wealthy-greeks-still-dodging-taxes-despite-crisis-a-864703.html) that they can't start taxing them, since the Greeks, in their infinite wisdom, has written in the fact that shipping don't have to pay taxes *in the constitution*. In the bloody constitution. I guess it has to take at least two elections to change that constitution (which, in greece might be quick) and perhaps also a number of years, a 2/3 majority etc. So, I don't think they are about to tax them just yet.


&gt;Most of the problem lies with 15000 people. They're listed and studied, but a democratic state can't seize their citizens' assets at a whim.

Nope, even the average Greek pay €1406/year in bribes. I am sure some people pay/receive more than others, but everyone is still in on it.  [Link of course](http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/greece_the_cost_of_a_bribe).

I heard it was one of the most discussed article about french this year.

What do you imply when you talk about growing in an ""old world culture"" ? Please correct me if I get it wrong but if you imply a conservative education full of religion and stuff like that I only think that It'll be worse as it's even more far away from reality. For instance I saw an infographic about the fact that in the USA, the states where the religious education is  stronger there are far more abortion for the girl under 18.

 It's true that the girl you stalked had to learn thing the hard way but I don't think that growing in an ""old world culture"" would have made it better. What she lacked was maybe advices from a sister to be confident and a strong personality to shut off the rudes boys she met. What she dosn't speak about is the positive thing she got for being pretty and I'm quite sure being gorgeous is better than being an ugly beta female right ?

She was cursed with a beta mindset on an alpha body. What a waste.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;First - you are confusing revenge with taking responsibility. If I refuse to pay my rent, since I think it is better spent on strippers, and the landlord throws me out - are you saying it is revenge from the landlord?

The difference is that throwing out Greece will have pernicious effects on the landlord too. You keep going on about punishing the sinners, but forget that by doing so, you will punish everyone else too.

&gt;Frankly, most of that debt have already been transferred to other countries taxpayers. Have you missed all the talk about fire walls. Greece's problem is now much more contained to Greece. It does not mean that Italy will fall, or Germany, which you seem to claim. Could you back that claim up with something? Will a Greek default be fun - certainly not, but there is no reason for the doom and gloom that you are portraying. Why, Greece might fall to the level of Estonia, the horror. Had Greece been allowed to default, it could be well on its way to recovery now.

You're just making stuff up to support your beliefs. Nobody can know what would happen in such an unprecedented situation. The question is: do we take the risk? Is it responsible to gamble the economic stability of the EU and the world on petty revenge and *Prinzipienreiterei*?

&gt;Here is also a a reference to report from Societe General about countries that would benefit from leaving the Euro (Italy, Ireland, Finland)

They're assuming that price competitiveness is all that matters for competitiveness, quod non.

&gt;Here is another report from Merrill Lynch, that says Italy

A ""report"" is a fancy word for a few paragraphs worth of speculation. Italy does not have the resource base of Russia, there's no reason to assume they can pull off an orderly default (because that's what it is), even if they do their economy will suffer because of the more expensive imports and if they are able to do it, why not just cut wages and prices with 10%, which will have the same effect on competitiveness without the stability risk and the rising import prices?

&gt; However, your claim that Finland have benefitted more from being in the Euro, than outside is incorrect. Here is the report of course, very interesting. Could you tell me why it is wrong, since you claim that it is?

The report states that the Euro is having the worst crisis so far, but nevertheless Finland would suffer from leaving it, even ignoring the transition costs.

Interestingly, the report says that the *weaker* countries would benefit from leaving the Euro, while the stronger ones do benefit the most from it... exactly the ones that are complaining now that they have to pay something. I think the relative advantages and disadvantages are in balance, while retaining the benefits of a large market and being a big currency on the world stage (elimination of currency risks and facilitating trade).

&gt;That has been a problem the lack of punishment, but that is not an excuse for breaking the rules. Do you think that there is? Nothing happens to you most of the time if you break the Kyoto agreement, but you are still an ass if you do. And, the fact is that they broke the treaty, doesn't mean that everyone else has to. To illustrate - just because Portugal needs money, doesn't mean that the ECB should bend it's rules, or any other country. The punbishments that I know are as far, fines for countries breaking the rules, and nothing more. But, that also mean that one is not punishing a country if one chooses not to support them. In other words - not paying for Greece's debt, is not a punishment (which you might claim), but just following the rules. Had they done that, Greece would have defaulted as well. And of course, fine all the Eurozone countries that haven't followed the rules, which I believe is everybody, but Estonia and Finland.

The point is that there was provision in the treaty what we should do in cases like this, so you can't claim the rules aren't being followed: there *are* no rules to follow. We elect people to improvise.

And I'm not going discuss your religious rants about sin and punishment any further. Cooking the books and not respecting the treaties is wrong, but finding the best way to manage the crisis is the priority right now.

&gt;Doubt it, our populistic parties in Western Europe, like in Denmark, the Netherlands etc have more influence than the communists. And we are richer, we should be ashamed.

I'm talking about communist parties in Eastern Europe. Western Europe has more fascist-style parties, indeed.

&gt;It is not likely. It is what you think will happen, and yes, you are using it as a threat.

It's not because you wish it isn't likely that it isn't. The risk exists. It's also not a threat: it's just a consequence of our actions. If I tell you that you might get soaked if you go walking outside without umbrella, am I threatening you? No, I am giving you fair warning about the weather.

&gt;I am Swedish, English is my second language. I often make spelling mistakes. In Swedish we spell it Rwanda. I have visisted my cousin when she was there, who works for SIDA in Africa(Swedish International Development Agency). I am also not a bloke. Fuck you for calling me a liar.

It's my second language as well, spelled the same way in my own language. If you've been there, you must know that Kagame's posse is far, far more corrupt than the Greeks. I think that in the 21st century one should be able to use nouns in a crossgendered way for people of undetermined sexe on the internet.

&gt;Where have I written that the Greeks are evil? And where have I written that the corruption is inborn?

Because you believe that the only way to improve the situation is to throw them out. Which only makes sense if you assume they can't change.

&gt;And, apparently you know nothing about the effectivness of HIV medicine. It prevent people from dying, you moron, so they get a chance to raise their children. It also lessens the risk of spreading it to other people. I could write so much about that, and link to extremely credible studies, but you are a racist, and don't care if African people dies.

Apparently you are a racist too then, because you aren't satisfied with the cuts in Greek healthcare and state services (which is keeping people sick and dying already). They must suffer more to satisfy your moral bloodlust. Then you donate a pittance to Rwanda to feel good about yourself.

And no, I don't think it's a good idea to invest much in what is essentially a bandage aid on a broken leg. In particular when we can't even set our fellow EU member straight. Clean your own windows first before tackling the neighbours backyard.

&gt;Yes, all the bribes paid the last five years in Greece has been to doctors, paid by parents to sick children. Now, I call you a liar.

Where do you think these people have to get that bribe money? By asking bribes themselves. They simply have the expectation to need bribes to get things done for their household. It's a classic tragedy of the commons - the first ones to play by the rules will screw themselves - so it's hard to change.

&gt;There are 25 out of 27 countries who has agreed to follow the rules of the Euro. So, as long as we are concerned, and also are paying for it (throught the EU, throught the IMF, and just through country giving money to another country, that is messed up because of the Euro - like UK and Sweden to Ireland for example) we should get a vote.

The contributions of non-Euro countries have been marginal, so their influence should be marginal too. They have been free riding on the eurozone efforts, so it's about bloody time they contribute something too. If they pull their weight, they can have a vote. But please let them stop whining about having to bail out the euro: they could join as well, and they have huge interests in the eurozone too, that will severely impact them should it break up.

&gt;Above all, if you care at all about democracy, you should think it is valid that people got to vote about things that truly concers them, the citizens of Greece of course, but also Germans, Finns etc. After all, the rules have been changed, without a vote. That has, of course, to be rectified.

There are plenty of ways to organize democracy, electing representatives is also a valid one. I repeat, there were no rules for the particular events we've been encountering, so it's really pointless to keep insisting on following non-existent rules.

&gt;? Apperently you are wrong, if we wanted to be more intvined, we would have accepted the banking union, or why not the FTT. We didn't.

Then I don't see why you would want a vote in eurozone matters. You are member of the club, or you aren't. The banking union is still being negotiated, anyway.

&gt;Do you think a union can work if one ignore democracy, rules and regulations?

Sono contento che ora i due siano in Italia e spero ci rimangano.
Detto questo, credo anche la situazione sia stata gestita malissimo dall'Italia. Innanzitutto: perché dei militari erano imbarcati su una nave civile? E' stata un'iniziativa del governo Berlusconi, caldamente suggerita da quell'esperto di strategie militari che è La Russa. Secondo questa logica, siccome lo Stato ha il compito di difendere il suo territorio, e siccome le navi che battono bandiera italiana sono parte del territorio dello Stato, il compito di difenderle spetta ai militari (dietro pagamento da parte degli armatori). E' un'idea cretina, e non a caso siamo gli unici al mondo a praticarla, tanto che gli indiani inizialmente pensavano che i due marò fossero dei semplici contractors (da qui l'arresto). Se gli armatori vogliono difendere le loro navi, devono assoldare delle guardie private armate, come fanno tutti gli altri Paesi, anche se questo va contro l'ideologia dominante in Italia secondo la quale lo Stato deve avere accesso alle armi. I militari devono stare sulle navi militari, pattugliare le acque pericolose, in collaborazione con le altre marine, e basta. Una nave militare non sarebbe mai entrata nelle acque territoriali indiane e soprattutto non avrebbe mai fatto sbarcare due militari. Mettere dei militari su una nave civile crea problemi di coordinamento tra il capitano della nave e i vertici militari, da cui dipendono i soldati. Inoltre, in caso di incidente, ci va di mezzo l'Italia, come regolarmente è successo. Bisogna ricordare per onestà che Frattini era contrario a questa legge proprio per il timore di incidenti del genere.
La gestione della crisi è stata poi fallimentare: invece di dichiarare subito che i due non c'entravano e che arrestare due militari in divisa imbarcati su una nave italiana è sostanzialmente un atto di guerra, il governo italiano ha tergiversato, minimizzato, cercato accordi sotto banco. Per questo motivo i nostri alleati sono stati freddi e non ci hanno dato l'appoggio diplomatico di cui avremmo avuto bisogno. Gli indiani da parte loro non potevano rilasciare i due senza perdere la faccia. Credo quindi che la licenza natalizia sia un compromesso per risolvere la situazione senza far passare gli indiani per calabraghe.",0,1356789229,null,0,false,0,c7nrwxg,t3_15lqj8,t1_c7nrwxg,t3_15lqj8,null,1430799217,6,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,6

&gt;The country is no longer able to hold back the crowd of migrants, many of whom do not want to integrate into the social and economic life of their new home country.

&gt;New rules will directly affect many of the immigrants who do not want to be of real assistance to the country and whose main goal is the existence at the expense of French taxpayers.


&gt;French business payroll taxes are among the highest in the world at approximately 50 percent. It could not have been different because the country had to feed a large number of migrants.


&gt;
 Many migrants, especially those from Arab countries-former colonies of France, are used to living on government subsidies. They have been doing it for years, and have been teaching their children this model of social behavior. 

&gt;
Reduction of benefits would hurt many migrant families. Will this provoke antisocial behavior where migrants would outpour their anger in the streets of French cities, destroying everything around them?

Les exilés travaillent souvent toujours en france, leur savoir et esprit d'entreprise n'est pas perdu. Par contre, ils ont soustrait leur patrimoine personnel à l'impot. C'est un problème strictement financier (pour l'état et pour eux) et moral. 

L'aspect moral est le plus important. Il touche deux idées : la solidarité et le mérite de ses fortunes. 

La solidarité est souvent évacuée et non abordée par les exilés car c'est une notion collective qui a peu de place dans leur univers mental, souvent libéral. Pourtant, négocier la durée de la taxe de 75% aurait été plus fin en terme de communication : il aurait souligné la volonté d'être solidaire sans être des moutons.

Pour le mérite, une vision marxiste ne conçoit la fortune que comme le résultat d'une exploitation, alors que la vision libérale le voit comme la récompense de l'effort et de la compétence. Difficile de trancher, mais des cas particuliers existent. 

( Le cas Depardieu, par exemple, est choquant car sa fortune s'est faite dans une industrie soutenue à bout de bras par l'état. Le cinéma français n'éxisterait plus sans les subventions qu'il lui sont accordés. Autrement dit, l'état est et a été un des financeurs de Depardieu. )

true,[deleted],null,null,"German federal elections usually take place in September or October, as will be the case in 2013.

For me, it's difficult to give a valid projection, for several, diverse reasons.

Most important is that these topics are being discussed at all. Both big parties, the christian-conservative CDU and the social democratic SPD have set their pre-election agendas to cover most of these topics in one or the other way.

To give a quick outline of the respective priorities, I'd say that the SPD is trying to hold workers' rights high by promising the long awaited minimum wage which according to the DGB, the association of the German trade unions, shall be at 8.50 Euros/hour. 

Further the SPD wants to prevent the German public from having to bail out banks in the future as it has been happening recently by promising stronger restrictions for investment banks and ""quick money"" in general. 

The social agenda of the christian-conservatives, led by Merkel, revolves around strengthening the ideal of a conservative family which basically means children, working, heterosexual  parents, caring for the pensioners. 

The financial disaster in Europe is mostly portrayed as shortcomings of the respective national governments not as a failure of the financial system in itself. According to christian-conservative public-relation, bailing out Greece and friends is the purest christian  idea of ""helping thy neighbour"". People tend to accept this approach rather than messing with an established system. 

Politicians of the CDU partly agree on that minimum wage but claim 8.50/hour is too high.

So, to cut it very short, social aspects are playing the key role, I can't really distinguish one party as unacceptable. Both agendas are not completely diametrical, both cover points that appeal to the largest parts of the population.

In the end, I guess, Merkel will win, maybe only with help of the social democrats in a ""big coalition"", CDU and SPD forming the government.

It won't make much of a difference, since social issues and the welfare state are of a higher priority than granting tax cuts to private companies or cutting social security for the lower and middle class.

Statistics everywhere suggest there is no difference between how the average Christian youth and average Muslim youth experiences his or her religion. Google a bit and you see that, while 2nd generation immigrants might become a little more religious than their parents, but 3rd generation immigrants become less religious.

Fact is that Europe is not a continent with a very public religious culture any more. Religion is personal and often in countries large minorities or majorities describe themselves as not religious. 

Europeans used to be pretty religious. There is no reason to suspect that if immigrants are helped to get involved in society and get access to quality education and all different kinds of opinions, they won't undergo the same process of secularisation as other people living in Europe did.

&gt;Doch Augstein pauschalisiert nahezu durchgehend, differenziert kaum, seine Wortwahl ist gruselig.

Soweit die taz. Hier die ""gruseligen"" Beispiele: 

&gt;Gaza ist ein Gefängnis. Ein Lager. Israel brütet sich dort seine eigenen Gegner aus.

""Unerträglich"" findet es die taz, dass Augstein Gaza und Lager in einem Atemzug nennt. Schönes Beispiel dafür, wie die selbsternannten Anti-Antisemiten sogar harmlose (zweifellos diskutierbare) Aussagen wie diese als antisemitisch brandmarken und so jede Meinungsäußerung kontra israelischer Besatzungspolitik zu unterdrücken suchen. Was die taz übrigens vergessen hat, ist der Kontext des Zitats: *""Wir wissen aus den WikiLeaks-Depeschen, was Israel in Gaza tut. Im Jahr 2008 erklärten israelische Offizielle den Amerikanern, dass Gaza ganz bewusst und absichtsvoll ""am Rand des Kollaps"" gehalten werde, ohne dass es aber zum völligen Zusammenbruch komme. Gaza solle ""auf dem niedrigsten Level funktionieren, der gerade noch eine humanitäre Katastrophe"" ausschließe.""* Das wiederum findet die taz nicht ""unerträglich"". Aber Gaza und Lager? Das geht gar nicht!

&gt;der israelischen Regierung attestiert er Kapital aus dem Mohammed-Schmähvideo zu schlagen

Im Text von Augstein geht es um Nentanjahu, der die Reaktionen ~~einiger~~ vieler Muslime auf das Mohammed-Video dazu nutzte, um gegen den Iran zu hetzen, dem man jetzt endlich mal die Grenzen aufzeigen müsse, weil die iranische Regierung genauso fanatisch wie eben diese randalierenden Muslime sei. Genau **das** nennt man Kapital aus etwas schlagen. Unerträglich für die taz? Nein! Nur der Hinweis darauf ist unerträglich. Und antisemitisch. Und irgendwas mit Hitler!

&gt;Sie (die israelische Politik) hat Angst vor der Zukunft und außer Gewalt kennt sie kaum eine Antwort

Mal davon abgesehen, dass auch hier wieder kein Wort über Juden fällt, ist die 'Politik der starken Hand', wie die Gewaltorgien der Israelis gern verniedlichend genannt werden, israelische Staatsdoktrin. Das kann man gut bzw. notwendig, oder -wie Augstein - schlecht finden, aber es ist ein Fakt. Man sollte den [Artikel](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/s-p-o-n-im-zweifel-links-israels-verpasste-chance-a-786383.html) wirklich lesen. Augstein argumentiert sachlich und differenziert zwischen israelischem Volk und israelischer Politik. 

&gt;In einem Beitrag giftet Augstein gegen ultraorthodoxe Juden, die Kinder bespucken würden und folgert daraus: „Diese Leute sind aus dem gleichen Holz geschnitzt wie ihre islamistischen Gegner. Sie folgen dem Gesetz der Rache.

Tatsächlich schreibt Augstein zwar auch über ultraorthodoxe Juden, die ein kleines Mädchen bespucken, weil es falsch gekleidet ist, aber vor allem geht es um die Aussage, dass die drei in der israelischen **Regierung vertretenen** ultrareligiösen/ultrarechten Parteien nicht ""unsere"" Werte teilen. [Und dafür gibts ja nun genug Beispiele.](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avigdor_Lieberman#Umstrittene_.C3.84u.C3.9Ferungen_und_Verhaltensweisen) Man muss sich nur mal vorstellen was in der ~~Welt~~ taz los wäre, wenn ein deutscher Außenminister solche Äußerungen über Juden machen würde.

Yes. That that is precisely my suggestion. That's why I'm in the France subreddit trying to get more perspectives.

She hails from a country founded on Puritanical religious bullshit that is aggressively fucked up about sex. Moreover, instead of any sort of real culture, her country has genocide instead. Now, this can be helpful when it comes to absorbing immigrant populations, since ""being American"" is something each person makes up for themselves, whereas ""being French"" has centuries up centuries of cultural momentum behind it.

And I would say that if your parents taught you to go through life *afraid*... whether of half the human race or as the OP seemed to indicate, just in general, then...

Indeed, America is mostly a culture of fear. It's used largely to sell us shit. Buy this so you don't end up alone and poor. It's why we elect assholes to our government--not because we like the guy's policies, but because we're afraid of the other guy. It's why we have so much gun crime. Look at Switzerland--full of fucking guns, no gun crime, but also no culture of being afraid of everything. Moreover, it's why we have indefinite detention without charges being brought, execution of American citizens without a trial, and wiretapping without a warrant. It's why we invaded Iraq for no goddamn reason. We were afraid.

Fear is inherently irrational. Fear is the mind killer. Fear builds nothing.

And any set or class of parents, any culture, that teaches children that we should be afraid of *ourselves*, that half the population warrants terror, is fucked up.

Messi has shown time and time again, that he is the world's best by far. They said he couldn't freekick, he did it.

et  pour ceux qui me dirait que Depardieu n'aurait jamais fait fortune sans les subventions de l'Etat, je leur repondrai que ce mr Ayrault ne vit QUE de notre argent !!! depuis des decennies et que ce mec ne rapporte RIEN  en plus value.

Et je conchie Depardieu qui ne fait que des merdes comme Asterix, Noah que des bouses comme Saga Africa (honte a lui), Tsonga qui nous fais chialer ds ses pubs minables, Ayrault qui n'est qu'un bon a rien qui nous coute surement ce que Depardieu rapporte par ses impots...

There's soooo many wonderful things in Sicily. I'm near Catania myself. 

Etna is wonderful for hiking, and this time of year is great for skiing, snowboarding, and sledding. 

More southern towards Ragusa, there is Cava Grande, which is an amazing and steep hike that will take you to a few small pools and waterfalls. 
Ispica has some neato natural caves to run around in. 

Marretimo, off of the coast a Trapani, has the best diving I have ever seen. Seriously, water so clear you can see all the way down for 40 feet. 

History is everywhere! And I DO mean everywhere! 

Every town in Sicily is fairly unique. They all have their own story and saint, and special sort of foods and various traditions. 

Palermo has the Crypts which is something worth doing while you're here. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacombe_dei_Cappuccini

Catania has so many churches, and again each have a sort of different flair. 

There's castles everywhere, Motta Anna'stasia, Sperlinga, etc. 

In Taormina, north from Catania (about 45 minutes depending on traffic), there's churches dating back to the 14th century and a Greek Amphitheater that was later used by the Romans, and is still used today sometimes for movies. 

I love Sicily. I would stay here forever if I could. 

I happen to be the designer of a local travel guide for a military base here, so knowing whats where and when the festivals are is sort of my job.

At this stop you will then transfer to the S-Bahn station and take the S1 towards Wannsee, and you can ride this train to either:   S+U Rathaus Steglitz, S Botanischer Garten, S Lichterfelde West, S Sundgauer Str., or S Zehlendorf, depending on which station is closer to your host family's home. (These stations should be around a 15 to 20 minute ride from the Brandenburger Tor station).

This option should be available at any time, because both the TXL bus and the S1 go fairly often (like every 10 minutes or so). But if you give me a rough estimate of when you should have your bags ready and what day of the week you arrive then I can look for that specific time.

Past Gela, Ispicia, and on to Modica! Modica is one of my favorite places here. It's has a uniquely baroque style architecture. You'll notice a difference in structure of the houses, and color (white = sandstone). If you pay attention to the landscape, it's also very different. You're in the area where the tectonic plate broke off from africa.

Modica is also famous for it's chocolate. The chocolate is very strong, a little bitter and crunchy (the chocolate never gets hot enough to melt the sugar). The recipe is very similar to the Aztec way. 
If you do make it to Modica make sure to go to the center of town in the ""bassa"", which is lower part of the city and go to Cafe della Arte and get a ""Chocolato caldo con latte"". Their version of hot chocolate and literally one of the most amazing things ever to eat. It has the consistency of  pudding but tastes like ... yeah.. just damn good. 

Bonajuto, which is tucked away in what looks like a side street of the main street, is the older chocolate maker in Sicily. Most of the time they'll give you a show on how they make it if you ask. 

And as any Sicilian town, there's a beautiful church (Saint Pietros) decorated with 12 Saints. They have some stunning fresco and paintings inside.

Poland, a country with deep ties rooted with and a strong admiration for the country of France, dating back centuries. However, I was born and raised in the United States. 


I'm a calm-mannered person with my loved ones, and in most situations, but to strangers who start up conversations with me in public, I can get just as defensive, mostly on the street or on public transit where anything goes. The men are often much older than me, and I've expressed absolutely no interest in social interaction (i.e. I'm reading a book or I have my headphones in. I don't look up). Telling them I would not like to have a conversation with them is often what I must do to continue on with my day.


I think she may have had to grow up in an entirely different country not to fear, yes. But I don't think it's completely dependent on unique parenting styles for individuals within different countries, because they vary from family to family. You said yourself, America is a country of fear. She likely would have had to grow up in an entirely different country where she is not subjected to the same media and is not trained to react this way.


Also, 


&gt; There are a number of correct responses to a horny teenage boy trying to get laid. Fear is not among them.


Not every situation will have the same ""correct"" responses (""correct"" being mostly subjective, anyway). The environment of the interactions plays a role (the subway vs. a classroom). Some men can be more aggressive than others when approaching a woman, and an inherent reaction from the woman might be fear. It's probably not healthy to always fear, but the way the Western world seems to work right now, fear happens. Total elimination of all fear, in any given situation, is exceedingly difficult. What matters is the reaction to the fear. I would say a calm, verbal let-down beats a violent reaction.

true,Britzer,BERL,Berlin,"&gt; Es sind primär das Element der Fixierung auf Israel und die Verharmlosung der Bedrohung durch den Gegner, die die antisemitische Komponente sowohl bei Grass, als auch bei Augstein ausmachen. 

Jupp, das mag stimmen, aber das waren nicht die Beispiele. Im TAZ-Artikel war davon keine Rede.

&gt; Man legt an Israel für seine Aktionen einen anderen Maßstab an als an die Palästinenser (oder Russen, etc.).

Ich denke, dass Kritik an Israel durchaus legitim ist und nur, weil man nicht erwähnt, dass auch anderswo Unrecht geschieht, ist man nicht sofort Antisemit. Klar sind die Palästinenser schlimm. Sie morden und schießen Raketen. Terroristen. Aber muss man immer darauf verweisen, wenn man Kritik an Israel übt? Wir reden hier über einen modernen demokratischen Staat, der im Zweifelsfall ähnlich wie wir handelt. Auch Deutschland hat schon im Kampf gegen den Terroristen einen Tanklaster in die Luft gejagt und dutzende umstehende Kinder ermordet. Und der Verantwortliche ist nicht verurteile worden. Er wurde vom Verteidigungsminister sogar als ""ehrenvoll"" verteidigt. Warum darf man den Krieg in Afghanistan verurteilen ohne den Terrorismus der Taliban zu erwähnen, wenn man das in Israel nicht darf? Wir sind Israel. Wir liefern Waffen. Wir unterstützten dieses Land. Da kann man doch mal erwähnen, dass da ein paar Sachen gewaltig stinken, oder?

&gt; sondern nur dazu, israelische Gegenschläge zu provozieren

Die Behauptung, dass alle israelischen Bombenangriffe ""Gegenschläge"" sind, ist schon ziemlich pervers und wird in der deutschen Presse weniger und weniger verwendet.

Erst in der Fixierung auf Israel wird es verdächtig. Aber wir Weißen fixieren doch ständig ungerecht. Aus Syrien wird eine Riesensache gemacht, weil in einem Jahr 50.000 Menschen sterben (übrigens kein Vergleich zu Gaza, so weit sind die Israelis noch nicht). Aber die DRC ist kein Thema, obwohl die es häufig auf ZEHNMAL!! so viele Menschen bringen. Aber das sind halt Schwarze. Und wir sind Rassisten. Ähnlich wie die Fixierung auf die Irak-Krieg damals, als gerade der äußerst grausame Bürgerkrieg etwas zum Erliegen kam, der vier Jahre lang wütete, aber in Europa sehr wenig Presseecho fand.

&gt; Am widerlichsten aber sind die Mascolos und Kisters, die Chefredakteure, die solche Kontroversen befördern, nur weil sie sich dafür Werbeeinnahmen ausrechnen, und damit den Antisemitismus in den Köpfen halten.

Und damit haben wir den Nagel auf den Kopf getroffen. Die Leute lesen gerne über Israel. Weil die Menschen uns dort sehr ähnlich sind. Oder weil sie alle Antisemiten sind. Das darf sich jeder selbst überlegen. Man verkauft mit Israel halt Zeitungen. Und Klicks. Vielleicht ist das eine viel plausiblere Erklärung dafür, dass über Israel geschrieben wird, als dass alle Antisemiten sind.

How convenient for you to ignore the fact that during WW2 people in the USA had no other good place to go and that in the post-WW2 the USA was the only country which had not been utterly devastated by the war and still tried to have a business friendly environment.

Trying the same thing today where there's no world war, where there's serious competition to the USA economy and when you can so easily store your money wherever and travel/work/live elsewhere, it's no surprise that any such insane tax rates fails spectacularly - just look at France, this new tax rate is not even close to 90%, it's only to incomes over 1 million euros and still the wealthy are all leaving France and settling in nearby countries, while France does increase the tax rate, their actual revenues from taxes go down and not up, it's like killing the chicken that lays the golden eggs.",0,1356830981,null,0,false,0,c7o16l5,t3_15mdr0,t1_c7o16l5,t1_c7nxbr8,null,1430803652,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1
