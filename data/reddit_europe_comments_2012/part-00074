2) Paris is very dangerous at nights especially for students willing to go to Montauban. Avoid leaving your place when the moon rises as werewolves are out. Seriously, it's just like any place, if you're careful enough to get out of trouble, nothing will happen to you, as you're a tourist, you shouldn't go to crappy areas, just stay where it's busy enough... There may be pickpockets in tourists areas, but once again, be careful enough, close your pockets, take care of your stuff and you'll be ok.

true,cholo_aleman,GERM,Germany,"&gt;The author certainly doesn't represent the majority of greeks. (...) The situation is presented from the perspective of a man that lost very few during the crisis, while the middle and lower classes lost much more from the far fewer that they had. While I understand the people who have money in the bank and are scared of losing them, it is the case that today in Greece more and more people are left with nothing.

i'm not sure what your point is. your claim seems to be that to understand the plight of the lower class you have to be one of them. that is nonsense in my opinion. alexis tsipras is not of the working class either, yet i assume you would not raise this claim against him, would you? 
my point is this: konstandaras raises some very salient points with regard to this election. one might easily cast them aside as 'self-hate' but that would just be ignoring the multiple failures of civil society and governance that have lead to the present situation, which is exactly what he does.

PS:
&gt;The author is afraid that his children won't be able to go study abroad, while today in Greece parents send their children at school unfed.

i fail to see what the first part of the argument has to do with the second. the european ERASMUS scheme applies to greece as well. the ability to send your kids to university has very little to do with school lunches (children of university age will be able to earn a living for themselves).

I agree that different economic and political systems will produce different attitudes and practices between countries and that shifts in those systems within a country can produce generational schisms that might be thought of as cultural difference.

I was being a bit pedantic, sorry. To paraphrase my reading of your argument:

1. ""Here is a list of recent political shifts in European countries.""

2. ""The U.S. hasn't had similar shifts within its states.""

3. ""Therefore, Europe is more culturally diverse than the U.S.""

So, to clarify my point: while your rhetoric (""There's really no comparison [needed]"") implied that this was a bulletproof syllogism, your conclusion didn't actually follow from your evidence. While they might produce cultural diversity, political and economic changes are not *themselves* cultural diversity. A variety of art, cuisine, language, music, etc. constitutes cultural diversity - political and economic changes might augment that kind of differentiation, but that doesn't go without saying. (Especially because in many cases one set of ""rituals"" gets replaced by another rather than being added to it.)

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; America is very far away from Iraq and Afghanistan, so we don't see the true effects of war. The media doesn't show any of the carnage.

My theory is that in Europe the perception of war is still shaped by the civilian experience from during WWII (or, more recently, Bosnia), whereas in the US it's primarily shaped by movies from the perspective of soldiers.  
The last time the US had a war at home was during the Civil War, and bloody as it was, the Battle of Stalingrad alone saw more dead. Of course there are many veterans in the US, but vets understandably don't usually like to talk about their combat experiences with outsiders because of the ""you wouldn't understand"" effect.

This difference of focus shapes the attitude towards war, because it isn't just something that happens between trained soldiers, it affects everybody from lack of essential supplies to being directly affected by the violence.

&gt; We don't even see pictures of American coffins; I don't know if they are removed from the media by censorship or if there is some kind of ""gentleman's agreement"" not to show them. Most likely, the military tells the press that any organization which shows the carnage of war will be blacklisted.

There was quite a controversy about this when the Seattle Times put a picture of flag draped coffins [on their front page](http://www.google.com/search?q=""seattle+times""+coffins+controversy) in 2004. The picture had been released as part of a FOI request. But yeah, they learned that the hard way during Vietnam.

&gt; No longer are reporters allowed to follow troops into combat and record what actually happens.

Well, there were ""embedded reporters"" during the Iraq War as well, but as you said, their reports had to be screened. Sometimes something [slips through](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6496898/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/us-probes-shooting-fallujah-mosque/), though.  
The ""embedded reporters"" thing is pretty clever. It gives the appearance of full access, but through the selection of units and the restrictions on what can be shown or not, there's a bias. Another important factor is unconscious self-censorship and bias by the reporter -- they train with those units and their lives depend on them. It's only natural that they grow close under the extreme conditions they are in.

&gt; Since the wars are presented in such a sanitized way, most people are not forced by grim reality to accept the true nature of war. Therefore, they get to pick the narrative they will use to understand the war, and the ""soldiers are heroes"" narrative is much more appealing to most people, especially if they have a family member in the military.

I don't think they'll bend over backwards to let Greece exit the Eurozone without leaving the EU, because at this point, they'd want Greece out.

true,nestoras,GREE,Greece,"&gt; The most infuriating thing I've seen in a while were the Greek protesters who compared Merkel to Hitler and the fucking bailout of their country to a second invasion.

Two points:

1. Nobody (sane) really thinks that Germans are Nazis or that Merkel should be compared to Hitler.

2. All of you guys keep using that word, 'bailout'. Nobody calls it 'a bailout' in Greece. It's a loan. Nobody is being 'bailed out' of anything, apart from foreign (and Greek) bankers. The way *all* Greeks see this 'bailout' is that foreign people send their precious money to (mostly) foreign or Greek rich investors so that they won't lose their profits, while placing an extremely heavy load on our backs and our children's backs (repayment). Very little (much less than 10%) of this money goes for public sector salaries or expenses, in case you are wondering. Please, do away with the notion that you are 'saving' somebody else other than bankers and you will be in a much better position to understand the average Greek's reaction to the whole situation.

After banks would have gone bust, the whole economy would have become into a halt due to both loss of finance to individuals and companies.

What this means is that the production of conventional oil is decreasing, and it won't return to overall growth apart from the occasional temporary bump, say, when production in Iraq picks up again.  
There are other sources of oil, like the tar sands in Alberta, or off-shore deep water wells, but those aren't just environmentally problematic, but also very expensive. That tar sands have become a common source of oil a few years ago isn't because they had only recently been discovered, or because the technology only became available then. No, it just was too expensive. Now prices are higher than the cost, so it's worth producing oil this way. As prices go up further, more sources become economically viable. So, we won't run out of oil any time soon, but it will become more expensive.

Haha. Right. Western interference (propping up dictatorships, occasionally even assassinating elected leaders of a country - e.g. Patrice Lumumba) in order to support their own corporations and businesses prevented any African country to successfully pursue some kind ""socialism"", or to even pursue the kind of social-democratic policies that turned Finland into one of the world's best liveable countries.

Blindly blaming the victims for what they are suffering through rather than analysing what is truly going is of course much more soothing to our conscience.

but does his income situation invalidate his argument? does it matter if he is reasonably well off? you are attacking him for something that isn't even implied in the article. yes, it is reasonable to assume that people who have less disposable income will be more affected in the case of a 'grexit' and the return to the drachma. but once again, that was not his point.

the main thrust of the article is this:

&gt;None of these parties have advanced a serious agenda to avoid disaster. Those who are deeply in debt — or who aspire to gain at the expense of others — hope that the economy’s slate will simply be wiped clean. Those who have stashed their money abroad will be able to buy assets on the cheap if Greece leaves the euro zone. But the people who work hard and pay taxes, who have a stake in reform and progress, who carry the burden of every mistake, have no credible representative to vote for. Those who want a better Greece have to look for the least bad option.

simply criticizing him for reflecting his immediate circumstances and adressing not adressing the working poor misses the point. his intention is to display the inner conflict, ahead of an election that only offers the choice between crooks and populists.",0,1339938162,null,0,false,0,c51qa3j,t3_v3kxw,t1_c51qa3j,t1_c51pnzz,null,1429162792,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,nestoras,GREE,Greece,"&gt; That might shave off a few billion, but when the public debt is 160%, how much do you think you're looking at? What would that honestly change right now? The debt would still likely be unsustainable. Are you saying no austerity? At all?

I don't think it will be just a few billion. Regardless, that's not the point. It will restore a sense of justice and transparency that does not exist today.

As for austerity vs. development, this whole debate has been a war of words, propaganda and strawman arguments. What does austerity mean? Like the vast majority of Greeks, I am in favor of destroying corruption, abolishing bureaucracy and waste, maintaining a primary budget surplus and in general reforming our government and our society to meet the standards of a modern European country. Does this mean that our hospitals must close down, our public schools deserted, our National Health System stop functioning? This is not speculation, this is today's reality in Greece. Perhaps you could undestand if you lived here.

&gt; Can Greece be trusted to reform, though? EU leaders have admitted that the austerity was too much and that there is some wiggle room, particularly with the time, but Greece had years to enact structural reforms and did nothing. Why is it different this time?

Can it? In my opinion, not while the same corrupt, bought-and-paid-for politicians are in power or the all-powerful corrupt worker's guilds keep blocking everything. It will never happen. That's what Europe doesn't get when they are urging Greeks to vote for the same-old, same-old establishment (New Democracy and PASOK). Are you effing kidding me? Maybe a new generation, both of politicians and of citizens can pull this off. Maybe SYRIZA can do it. I have my doubts.

Anatole France

Les lois ne sont pas destinées aux mêmes personnes. Qu'il s'agisse de droit des étrangers, de code du commerce, du code civil, etc. D'ailleurs, pour te dire, je bosse actuellement dans une organisation dont l'objectif est justement d'amener la loi à être favorable à certains groupes d'individus (le patronat de certains secteurs). Et ? Cela se fait sans aucune corruption. Mon organisation porte juste la parole de certains groupes d'individus organisés. La fierté de certains salariés ? Avoir réussi à infléchir la loi avant son vote, et pas après, en portant la voix du patronat auprès des députés. La loi, lorsqu'elle est voté, comprendra alors certaines sophistications, dont tout le monde (ou presque) se fout, et qui correspond à nos intérêts. C'est comparable à l'abrogation de cette circulaire : elle ne concerne qu'une toute petite minorité, qui a su se faire entendre, et qui se fout d'ailleurs du reste des gens dans la même situation qu'eux.

Il ne s'agit pas de corruption. La loi n'est JAMAIS neutre sur des sujets comme l'immigration. Officiellement, oui. Dans la pratique, jamais. Et je dis bien, une dernière fois : jamais. Aucune loi ne concerne, sociologiquement, l'intégralité de tous les citoyens de notre pays. La loi est la même pour tous, oui. Mais la loi n'est pas à destination de tous, lorsqu'elle est créée. Elle est le fruit de groupes de pressions, d'individus guidés par des intérêts privés ou plus larges, d'idéologies et de conception du monde.

Notre ancien gouvernement n'a pas plus cherché à séparer les classes qu'un autre. Il n'a fait que mener une politique absurde. C'est critiquable. Okay. Mais en termes d'intérêts de classe, Sarkozy fait comme Hollande/le PS : il a cherché à avantager celles et ceux qui peuvent le faire élire/réélire. Ce n'est pas du cynisme, hein. C'est pragmatique. Le fait que l'un ou l'autre enrobe ses actions par de jolis discours, c'est autre chose.

Non, je ne dis pas que les riches et les pauvres doivent mener leurs combats chacun de leur côté. Je dis juste que l'abrogation de cette circulaire ne concernait qu'une minorité d'immigrants, et pas parmi les moins aisés. Et qu'un étudiant dans un domaine non-inscrit dans la liste des métiers sous tension aura TOUJOURS les mêmes difficultés à trouver un boulot en France. Il ne faut pas croire que cela facilite la vie de TOUS les étudiants. Encore une fois, il ne s'agit que d'une MINORITÉ d'entre eux.

Pour ta femme, ça doit être affreux. Le système d'immigration français est kafkaïen, totalement délirant, et rebutant. J'ai honte d'être Français lorsque je vois cela. Bon courage à vous deux.

Quant aux ""grands écoliers"" qui peuvent enfin rester en France, ces derniers sont totalement désolidarisés, pour la plupart, des ""autres immigrants"". On ne peut pas leur en vouloir : ils ne se sont pas battus pour l'ensemble des immigrants, mais uniquement pour eux. C'est un constat. Et ? Ils ont presque autant intérêt que nos élites actuelles à freiner les flux migratoires SAUF pour eux. Ils sont plus proches des hommes et femmes politiques, des chefs d'entreprises et des cadres de haut-niveau que des gens enfermés dans des CRA. Ils pensent à eux. Il faut arrêter de croire que cette abrogation était un geste en faveur d'un système d'immigration plus souple. Ce n'était pas le cas.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I can give you some insight from a TVET point of view, as I am currently studying TVET. 

Historically, the unions date back several hundreds years in Germany and most other European countries, they are considered to be partly successors of the medieval guilds.

The German word *Gewerkschaft* comes from *Gewerke*, which means trades like masons, carpenters, roofers and so on.  A Gewerkschaft is a union of all men working in a Gewerk (trade).

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; Nobody calls it 'a bailout' in Greece. It's a loan.

That's what a bailout usually is, actually.

Also, while the fairness is indeed disputable, bailing out the people to whom Greek citizens have loaned their money in the form of savings and pensions is also an attempt to secure those savings and pensions. While it would probably be prudent (as the Danish state and others have done) to provide a fund allowing the Greek state to guarantee the security of those savings in the face of widespread bankruptcy (so banks can fall without citizens losing significant amounts of money), a bank default has *very* widespread consequences in other countries (such as Spain) where banks have loaned money to Greek banks and investors at an artificially low interest rate. It's not *only* about saving Greece in that regard, it's about damage control and avoiding a pan-European economic catastrophe, caused by frivolous lending to countries like Greece, who shouldn't have been able to borrow money at German interest rates.

&gt; Funny thing, my friend. I don't have enough money to put gas in my car or even feed myself properly. Has anyone been offering to feed me 'cause I must have missed it... my friend.

Trust me, an avalanche of Greek bank defaults is *not* going to make life in Greece any easier. You have nobody to blame but your own politicians for this mess, especially not other EU countries. Making endless expensive promises to the populace, while financing the whole thing through loans, at artificially low interest rates — loans which aren't real investments in infrastructure, structural reform, education, or industry — is a recipe for disaster. Your sarcasm doesn't change that, and your other posts suggest you understand this.

It has always been the rich vs. the poor, and the crisis hasn't changed that — the question is whether the Greek populace is going to finally take steps to get rid of the *extremely* widespread corruption and wasteful bureaucracy that plagues your country (don't call this propaganda, it's not like we haven't all seen it first hand while acting the role of pasty white stupid northern tourists enjoying the wonderful islands, countryside, and culture of Greece). 

Investors are parasites, yes, we all deal with them. And yet, many other societies have these mechanisms in place without half the problems of Greece. It's logical to conclude that ""the rich"", as you say, whose fault it is that we have these problems, are not the ones playing the game, but the ones *cheating* at the game. That is: Corruption.

It's basically ignoring the politics behind it all. The Africa example is just a proof of this, although a lot of the Western driven development agenda there is also all about blaming the victims and ignoring the politics and the wider historic perspective.

&gt;However, I don't see why those external factors shouldn't affect Finland, Slovenia, Estonia etc just as much for example, but they are not in as much trouble as Greece, at all, or are you saying it's a grand conspiracy towards Greece?

No, of course not. And no, not all countries are facing exactly the same external factors obviously.

&gt;I don't think it's moralistic to ask people to pay your debt. I do think everyone should pay their debt. If that makes me a moralist, so be it. I suppose you want to tear the whole economic system down, and go back to bartering or something, but as long as we have this system that we are having, it is built upon interest rates and borrwing. If you don't like it, don't borrow.

There is nothing wrong with being a moralist, the problem here is that the pay-your-debt moralism is fucking wrong. And you're being simple and crude. The choices that could've been made are not between either paying back high-interest loans with austerity conditions or tearing down the whole economic system.

true,michaelnesmith,null,null,"As an American who travels in Europe for business regularly, I think this is a very interesting topic, with some very interesting points are being made. 


I think a potentially relevant angle is not just the difference in culture between Europe and the US, but also the importance Europeans and Americans do, or don't, tend to place on these cultural differences, and why.


The different priority given to cultural differences is a broad generalization that can easily be contradicted at a micro level in a variety of details or specific counter-examples.  But the broad trend is, I think, both important and accurate.  

So, here we go:

Broadly speaking, there are significant differences between European countries, and these differences are often viewed as part of these country's national identity.  This, understandably, is rooted in European history and a thousand or so years of competition between various city-states; city-states who often had their own home-grown cultures, languages, and their determination on whether or not Jerry Lewis is funny, and whether or not David Hasselhoff sells a lot of records.

On the other side of the Atlantic, America (as has been noted) was and is a country of immigrants.  Everyone is from ""somewhere else"".

For very shred political, economic and nationalist reasons, this led to the creation of a broad ""American Culture"".  

Being ""an American"" was and is defined in very simple terms: you are here, and you want to stay here.  

Your history of art doesn't matter, and what you wear on the weekends doesn't matter.

This meant that an immigrant could hop off a boat and say, ""Hey, I wanna be an American.""  And everyone said, ""Great, you're American now!  Whoopadee doo!  Welcome.  Now, make yourself useful and go get a job or build a dam or something""

This is a subtle but important distinction.  The system in America was set up to allow most anyone to come to the US and ""become an American"".  

Arrive from steel mills in Ireland with a suitcase?  Great.  Get a job in our car factory; you're now an American.  

Come from from the rural provinces in China and want to be an American?  Great, congratulations!  Go build a railroad or something.  You (or at the very least your children) are now American.  

Show up from the docks in Liverpool and arrive in Boston?  

""Ahh, lucky you, we have docks here, too.  Just recite the pledge of allegiance and sign this paper.  Congrats, you're an American.  Go but a hotdog and get out of my face.""

You get the idea.  There are plenty of other examples.  And there are plenty of examples where things weren't nearly so dramatically over-simplified, without a doubt.  But the broad picture is accurate.  

American ""culture"" was (and usually still is) about setting up a system to assimilate other cultures and peoples, while allowing them to still be part of an over-arching organization that superseded their original national identity/culture.  

The result was and is groups from all over the world; China, Ireland, Senegal, Vietnam, wherever...that retain their original heritage and varying degrees their original national or ethnic ideologies and practices...but due to the system, and their willingness, these people were now, whatever their background, first and foremost, ""American"".  

And this is the important part:  broadly speaking, within a generation or two at most, they and/or their children or grandchildren...were accepted as being American.  By other Americans.  

This is important.  And it's actually a pretty brilliant system when you think about it.

This system allows me, encourages me in fact, to subliminate my Scotch-Irish heritage and put my energy into ""being an American"".  It encourages me to mimic or even truly value the ideals associated with ""America"".  

Go to baseball games, eat hotdogs, buy an SUV; whatever.  The important part is that I've been given this ""meta-culture"" that I can participate in and identify with, and it works even if I'm a wealthy warlord from Mozambique and you're a poor Leprechan-manufacturer from Dublin.  The system instead helps us all minimize our differences and focuses on what we have in common: being American.  

And focusing on what we have in common is of course good for the economy, good for political unity, good for the military.  And really, it's probably actually the only way a country full of immigrants could ever work together long enough to stop throwing rocks at each other and burning each other on the sake every weekend.

And this, certainly at a systemic level, very different from the world of Europe.  

I can immigrate to France, and no matter how much I want it, nor how hard I work, I am never going to be a ""Frenchman"", at least not to other Frenchmen.  

That is because being a ""Frenchman"" is predicated on something I cannot change:  whether or not I have Gallic blood in my veins.  It's broadly the same in Germany, the UK, Spain, Italy and so forth.

And something along these lines is more or less *still* true in most of Europe.  

Due to different influences and different histories and geographies, the countries in Europe were not set up to assimilate foreigners.  Sure, foreigners could be accommodated, but mainly because the expectation was that these foreigners were going to go home sooner or later.  

For much of the history of the US, there was no ""home"" that any of these people were ever going to return to.  Bear in mind that, for most of US history, America was really, really far away from the Euro/Asian landmass.  You came here, you probably weren't going home.  Ever.  

So the only option was to make this new place, ""America"", home.  And since you aren't ever going home again, you are very motivated to get on board with whatever the American value system is, and not matter how different your original system was.

And again, when this system works, this encourages a sublimination of whatever original culture or nationality that someone brought with them to the US.  

And broadly speaking, it has worked really well. 

And broadly speaking, European countries still have difficulty assimilating foreigners.  

Not saying they fail completely.  Not even saying whether or not is't good or bad for a country to assimilate foreigners. I am saying, however broadly, that they still have difficulty with it.  

There is no clear cut road for an immigrant to follow if he wants his children to be viewed and accepted as ""French"" or ""British"" or ""Dutch"".  

Among other things, this tends to create immigrant enclaves that keep to themselves and hold tightly to their original culture within the boundaries of their specific neighborhoods, families, or business sectors.  Contrast that with the picture of the family that immigrated from Russia to the US in 1910.  It wasn't uncommon for the parents to forbid their children to even speak Russian at home.  They wanted their kids to be Americans, not Russians.

So, Europe generally does not give immigrants a clear path for acceptance in a new culture, and therefore no clear motivation for abandoning their parent culture.  

Even today, you still see the results: an enclave of French Moroccans that riot and set fire to a Parisian suburb.  Muslims in conflict with UK courts on using Sharia law in a London neighborhood.  The banning of wearing burkhas in public.  The murder of a Dutch filmmaker by local radicals.  

To be clear, I don't think this is all simply the result of a) history, and b) geography (i.e., it's a lot easier to start worrying about the culture of hotdogs and SUV's, when you don't have a competing culture with swords and boats just on the other side of the river, 100km away).

And I'm also not saying these things never happen in the US.  I am however saying that when it does happen in the US, it's because the cultural-system I describe didn't work, for whatever the reason.

TL; DR:  Regardless of how much diversity is or is not present within the US relative to within Europe, there is deliberate system in America designed specifically to subliminate the cultural differences in America.  That system is not nearly as present in European countries, and this helps account for the importance, or lack of importance, placed on cultural differences when comparing the two groups.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;500 years ago ""settler"" was shorthand for ""genocidal fundamentalist"".

Considering how we Portuguese settled the New World and preferred to convert the natives rather than just kill them or sell them as slaves, sure, it wasn't pretty by any modern standard but it was way better than what the Spaniards or English did.

Also, even without many Portuguese around, blacks and natives stood for Portugal and were very important in keeping the empire together, for centuries there was bloodshed in defending the empire, and it wasn't only the Portuguese defending it, we were all in it together.

This isn't nationalism, it's the truth, history often wrongly portray us as violent colonialist murderers but we always were the softest ones, our focus was always in trading.

Two quick examples to prove my point:

[Socotra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socotra)

&gt;In 1507, a fleet commanded by Tristão da Cunha with Afonso de Albuquerque landed an occupying force at the then capital of Suq. Their objective was a Portuguese base to stop Arab commerce from the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, and to liberate the presumed friendly Christians from Islamic rule. Here they started to build a fortress. However, they were not welcomed as enthusiastically as they had expected and abandoned the island four years later, as it was not advantageous as a base.

[Macau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau)

&gt;Macau prospered as a port but was the target of repeated failed attempts by the Dutch to conquer it in the 17th century. On June 24, 1622, the Dutch attacked Macau in the Battle of Macau, expecting to turn it into a Dutch possession after its conquest. The Portuguese repulsed their attack and the Dutch never tried to conquer Macau. The majority of the defenders were Africans slaves, with only a few Portuguese soldiers and priests. Captain Kornelis Reyerszoon was commander of the 800 Dutch strong invasion force.
&gt;
&gt;The Dutch Governor Jan Coen said after the defeat that ""The slaves of the Portuguese at Macao served them so well and faithfully, that it was they who defeated and drove away our people there last year"", and ""Our people saw very few Portuguese"" during the battle.",0,1339963599,null,0,false,0,c51ugac,t3_v4vqv,t1_c51ugac,t1_c51tzeo,null,1429164814,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/28071-jobbiks-anti-roma-crusade

&gt;[...]Investigators suspect the Hungarian Guard, which has recently been declared an illegal organization, of collusion in some of the numerous murders of Roma people, which have also prompted criticism of the police, who failed to take action to defend the Roma community. Shortly after midnight on February 23, in the Roma village of Tatárszentgyörgy, an unidentified attacker set fire to a house using a petrol bomb. When the residents of the house attempted to leave the burning building, the attacker opened fire, killing a father and his four-year-old son. Since last November, there have been five murders of Romas, and every week brings fresh news of further attacks on Roma villages. The police have acknowledged that the attacks were organized by the Hungarian Guard. However, this is a view not shared by the new Jobbik MEP, Krisztina Morvai, who in the run-up to elections suggested that the deaths in Hungary were the likely result of inter-Roma feuding.

&gt;Three independent organizations worked on the report on the Tatárszentgyörgy murders. Initially, the police refused to investigate the killings, arguing that the deaths had resulted from an accident. Furthermore, the report suggests that the police actually impeded the investigation. Senior police officers subsequently admitted that racism in the ranks was an issue in the police force. The Hungarian Chief of Police, József Bencz, even recently acknowledged that the 'professional' style execution of the attack did in fact imply that the the killers may have been soldiers or police officers.",0,1339965561,null,0,false,0,c51utzx,t3_v6jk4,t1_c51utzx,t1_c51tznj,null,1429164993,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"The two formerly dominant parties, New Democracy (center-right) and PASOK (Panhellenic Socialist Movement, center-left) are, formerly enemies, now the ""pro-austerity"" bloc. They accept the EU memorandum in principle, but want to negotiate improved terms. They tried to form a broad centrist coalition after the last election, but fell a seat short. However, PASOK is now a bit worried about being by far the junior partner, and seeming like enablers of the pro-austerity right, so they would *like* for a coalition to be broader than just PASOK-ND. Remains to be seen if they'll grit their teeth and support an ND government in a junior role, anyway.

Syriza (Coalition of the Radical Left) is a coalition of miscellaneous left-wing groups, which has become the major anti-austerity party. They would attempt to form a leftist coalition, and oppose the EU memorandum.

Democratic Left is a left-ish split from PASOK, but considerably more centrist than Syriza. They refused to join the last attempt to form a PASOK-ND government unless Syriza was also included (making it a broad unity coalition), because they were worried about being seen as sellouts propping up PASOK-ND (i.e. why did you split from PASOK if you're just going to go crawling back to them?). But they might join such a coalition if it comes to that a 2nd time around.

Independent Greeks is an anti-austerity populist-right split from New Democracy. Afaict there's no plausible coalition that they fit into, because they won't join up with either the anti-austerity left, or the pro-austerity center-right.

KKE (Communist Party of Greece) are what their name indicates, and are mostly old dogmatic communists who still think Stalin was great (seriously, some people were expelled from the party semi-recently for ""revisionism"" on the Stalin question). Have strong historical support in the working class, but their geriatric, out-of-touch leadership has made them increasingly irrelevant.

It's not entirely clear, their base nowadays consists mostly of old people and the protest vote. They played a big part in resisting during the German occupation in WW2. We also had a US-supported military Junta for a few years so that might have played a role. They were a much bigger party but they lost their influence first when  they split after disagreeing over ideological supervision from the USSR. From that split emerged what would later become Syriza. Then PASOK came along after the Junta and took all but their most loyal supporters.

This is where we diverge then I suppose. That is exactly what I would refer to as 'young'. 100,000 years is one click above nothing nothing in terms of evolutionary time. 

&gt;Why do all cultures have leaders? Why do people not seem to care for people they don't know? For the same reason that people can't pick random numbers, our brains are hard wired that way.

No disputes here. Hunter-gatherer society isn't so different from the social structures of other great-apes. Our current social structures are simply radical extrapolations of the same tendencies rising to meet extremely novel conditions initially brought about by agriculture.

&gt;It won't change either because it doesn't improve the survival of the individual or the species.

Agree somewhat. I think it is clear that, insofar as our relations with the global ecosystem that maintains human-friendly environmental conditions (meaning the correct balance of gases in the atmosphere, levels of radiation, temperature, etc.) an improvement in, say, the ability to account for the long-term effects of our collective actions would indeed benefit the chances of our survival greatly. Likewise, a tweaking of our psychology to reduce the chance that we will commit collective suicide via nuclear war or some other similarly destructive action due to our tendency for violence would certainly contribute to the likelihood of our continued survival. I suspect, however, that these problems are far too abstract for evolution alone to serve as a correcting force.

Although not all Europeans are bilingual of course, I don't think there is a country in Europe with as low levels of bilingualism as the UK. In this sense I feel a certain amount of 'kinship' with other nations of the anglophone world; US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with which the UK shares an historical link. This contributes to making me feel less 'European'. 

Another fact is that the UK itself is a state made up of 4 countries, so that you have your nationality; English, Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish and then the regional identity of 'British'. This might be slightly different for other EU countries like France, Belgium or Germany which have a national identity and then the regional identity of 'European'. This might explain why less people in the UK identify as European compared to other countries.

You have to take into account that you basically want to have energy out of the ground, the oil is just a means to get to it. But you need energy first to get to the source of the oil.

This is called EROI (energy returned on invested) or also EROEI. If you want to read more, you can read an introduction on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_returned_on_energy_invested) or a [study](http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/3/10/1796/) from the Sustainability journal.

From the study: *These authors also estimated through linear extrapolation that the EROI for global oil and conventional natural gas* **could reach 1:1 as soon as about 2022** *given alternative input measurement methods*.

What does it mean? Regardless of price, if the EROI reaches 1:1, it doesn't make sense to get this oil - could just be not there for practical purposes. If one barrel is used to get one barrel out, why bother?

Tar sands (""fracking"") are already at 3:1 according to some calculations - you need 1 barrel of oil to get 3 barrels out. Gives you two barrels net. If that goes to 2:1, you need **double the amount than before** to give the same net result. If you need double the effort, the price will double, too.

There is the possibility of cheating being discussed by building a nuclear reactor close to the extraction site, but this is far-fetched in my opinion.

If it never governed and if it will never govern now, it can promise all kinds of shit to people. It consistently insisted that they can say to the EU to be very lax to them and nothing will happen.

PASOK is the most establishment and most to blame of them all.

true,krattr,null,null,"Let me offer a synopsis and an explanation.

Kasidiaris (Golden Dawn's MP) threw a cup of water at Dourou (a Leftist MP with SYRIZA, also elected for the first time). She said that if GD is going to be re-elected, ""they"" will bring Greece ""500 years back"", and asked Kasidiaris if he ""got an adjournment"".

Pause for some background information. According to an eye-witness, back in 2007 five unidentified persons attacked and stabbed a student, and got away with a car that Kasidiaris hired, allegedly. Kasidiaris says that at the time of the attack he was at a hospital working as a medical advisor (he's a food chemist), and that his car was parked there. He also says that the eye-witness is affiliated with SYRIZA (GD doesn't get along with them), and he already sued her.

Back to the present. Kasidiaris found Dourou's remark insulting, as his trial was postponed because there was no time to hear it within court hours, and not because he or his lawyers asked for it. This is common; courts are understaffed and Greece can only hire 1 person per 5 dismissals or retirements. So, he had the brilliant idea to throw a cup of water at her, shouting the equivalent of ""get lost, sucker"". A second MP, Kanelli, elected with the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) but having a Conservative background, stood up and hit him with her party's newspaper. She also made some other remarks before and during the cup throwing incident (""bums"", ""faggots""). Apparently, this didn't go well Kasidiaris, hence the second brilliant idea of slapping Kanelli. He then evaded arrest for 48 hours, because, as he said, he didn't want to be a media spectacle. He showed up three days later, and went to testify and countersue them. After the incident, there were mainstream media reports about Dourou's relations with controversial members of the ""old establishment"", allegedly helping to hire her in the public sector.

Now, the whole situation with Golden Dawn is easy to understand. First of all, 95,72% of the registered voters in Greece did not vote for them. Second, the voting behaviour of a small percentage of people is directly related to their own circumstances and their social environment. Deal with austerity and illegal immigration and GD's percentage will shrink.

There is a huge immigration wave coming from Middle East and Asia. Greece has a large coastline, its borders are EU's external borders, and Turkey isn't easy to deal with. Illegal immigrants travel for months, pay up to €10,000, then with the help of Turkish slave traders cross the border and become trapped in Greece. Most of them have no papers and claim that they're seeking asylum for political reasons, which is practically impossible to verify (good luck with correspondence with Afghanistan and Pakistan). The problem is with the European regulations: if an illegal immigrant is caught in Greece, and then tries to enter other states in the Schengen area (as there are no internal controls), then he's sent back to Greece. Greece can't deport him because his country of origin doesn't accept him. Turkey doesn't accept him, despite the agreements they signed, because then Turkey is reponsible for taking care of him. Central European countries point the finger, but they don't have unruly neighbours, as they are surrounded by other EU states. Other Southern states also face similar problems, with immigration waves coming from Africa.

While some of these people are honest, hard-working, and genuine asylum seekers, never causing any problems, many of them make life unbearable for poor people living in deprived neighbourhoods, and professionals that regularly see their businesses being robbed. Police can't function properly with a drastically reduced budget. GD's members function as unofficial bodyguards, they cater for food and help elderly pensioners. They even provide free self-defense classes for women. When the state is absent, GD fills the gaps in its own way, and some people vote for them.

GD's rise is very simple to explain and totally reverseable.

true,tihoff,null,null,"OK, you have three parts in your trip - concerning beer quality that is. (also, this is completely objective information, all others with different opinions do not know what they are talking about ;)

Part 1: The not so interesting part

*Frankfurt 
Bacharach 
St.Goar 
Düsseldorf (1 month here for a class) 
Wolfsburg 
Berlin 
Leipzig 
Dresden* 

OK, maybe Alt Bier is something worth taking a look at as you are in Düsseldorf anyways...  also I heard of some decent beers in the Leipzig/Dresden area.


Part 2: Bavaria - The good stuff

*Nürnberg 
Regensburg 
München* 

You should check out **Klosterbrauerei Weltenburg** in Regensburg. Arguably the oldest brewery in the world this is a must visit. Although I only visited the Abby on the Danube close to Regensburg which is stunning and offers a nice beer garden. The brewery itself is in Regensburg itself as far as I know.

You won't have a problem finding breweries in the other parts of Bavaria as well. Nürnberg is in Franken which is a region with a very high (highest?) density of breweries. Good beers as well.  Munich is of course also the place to be. Don't bother going into the Hofbräuhaus, this is way too touristy. 

Part 3: The other not so interesting part, although it might be better from a beer perspective than the first part...

*Ulm 
Stuttgart 
Baden-Baden 
Heidelberg 
Mannheim 
Frankfurt*

In the Black Forest region between Stuttgart and Baden-Baden, Rothaus brewery is quite famous, good and common. The brewery itself is a little way to the south, but you'd surely get some Black Forest scenery driving there... 
In general, beers from southern Germany are better than the ones from northern Germany.

Dublin is often referred to as the 'Pale' and its population as 'West Brits' or more offensively 'Jackeens' by some of the more patriotic Irish inhabitants, I myself am regularly reminded that I am not 'true Irish' through obvious looks of disdain and very often overt comments whenever I leave my county. 

And it's not entirely without cause, having been educated in a private school in south Dublin, which is a rather isolated sector of the nation, only ever socialising inwards with general disregard for people who didn't go to one of the big rugby schools,(and it's very easy to tell if someone wasn't part of it, we seem to have developed quite a stupid subculture of personality which is easily distinguishable.) Anglo values are all well and good but the attitude of total exclusion and disregard of people hailing from elsewhere in the country is quite a malignant realisation.

However, I feel like an alien in my own country, which is quite traditional and conservative (abortion is still illegal), where Dublin would be more progressive and left wing. When I visit European cities I find I have much greater shared values and a shockingly similar lifestyle. 

Perhaps the issue is not privilege vs non-privilege but rather urban vs rural, Dublin really being the only major city (hosting 1/4 of the population) and it isn't even really a major city in EU terms.

I think it might be interesting to keep an eye on even after the immediate crisis has passed. Greece is in a truly unique situation. Through the cheap credit after Greece had joined the Eurozone, wages, prices and the size of the government have increased to what is simply beyond what the economy and foreign credit would have permitted them to develop into under ""normal"" conditions. The closest would probably be a country where, a decade after oil had been discovered in one region, that region declares independence and splits off. Add to this the power vacuum because all the established parties have lost their credibility, and a government that only draws its legitimacy from the lack of alternatives and fear of collapse, and in most other parts of the world you would have the conditions for a civil war. A party like Syriza could have never gained the kind of support they have without that void of credible political leadership, and they've grown so quickly that they're overstretched.

&gt; experiences, they are dailey occurances that add to our character,
&gt; who we are, and how we see things. without experiences, who 
&gt; would we be?

Erfahrungen, dies sind täglichen Ereignisse die sich zu unserem Character aufsummieren - wer wir sind und wie wir Dinge sehen.
Ohne Erfahrungen - wer wären wir dann?
*(correct: ""wer wären wir ohne Erfahrungen"", but the former is more dramatic)*


&gt; this is me, well former me. the me before my exchange, the me i will
&gt; from now on only see in pictures. lets look at some of the 
&gt; experiences that have made me who i am today.

Das bin ich, nunja, mein früheres Ich.
Mein Ich vor meiner Veränderung, mein Ich welches ich von nun an nur noch auf Bildern sehen werde. Lasst uns einige Erfahrungen ansehen, die mich zu dem gemacht haben der ich heute bin.
*(if you are female: die mich zu der gemacht haben, die ich heute bin)*

&gt; i graduated high school, an experience you only have once, 
&gt; but it left its mark.

Ich habe die High School absolviert, eine Erfahrung die man nur einmal macht, doch sie hinterließ ihre Spuren.

&gt; i was part of lock in in a hotel called ""trapped sober"" which was 
&gt; definitely an unforgettable experience.

I'm not sure what you mean by this sentence. Were you imprisioned in the hotel? Or were you part of illegel immigrants?

&gt; i was there when my sister got married, when my mom got married.
&gt; and even when my other sister got married in april while i was still
&gt; here, i didnt have much to say tho.

Ich war dort als meine Schwester geheiratet hat, als meine Mutter geheiratet hat. Auch im April, als meine andere Schwester geheiratet hat, war ich immer noch dort.
Ich hatte sowieso nichts zu sagen.

&gt; even all the small things, like having a nice evening with the family is
&gt; an experience. but ever since this year experience has taken on a 
&gt; whole new meaning. i have had the exchange student experience, 
&gt; ive experienceed a different life, a different culture.

Sogar all die kleinen Dinge, wie ein netter Abend im Kreis der Familie, sind Erfahrungen. Doch seit diesem Jahr hat ""Erfahrung"" eine neue Bedeutung *(für mich)*. Ich hatte eine Schüleraustausch-Erfahrung, ich habe ein anderes Leben erfahren, eine andere Kultur.

&gt; from the very beginning of this whole experience, we had no idea 
&gt; what we were getting ourselves into, we were just ready to see 
&gt; europe.

Am Anfang dieser Erfahrung hatten wir keine Idee auf was wir uns einließen, wir waren nur bereit Europa zu sehen.
*do you really mean ""ready""? Or would curious = gespannt fit better?*

&gt; first experiences started with the three weeks with my temporary 
&gt; host family, which was like a warm up experience to all that i was 
&gt; about to experience with my permanent host family in a whole 
&gt; different place.

Die Erste Erfahrung begann mit den drei Wochen in meiner vorübergehenden Gastfamilie. Dies war wie eine Aufwärmerfahrung für all das, was mir mit meiner dauerhaften Gastfamilie an einem anderen Ort wiederfahren würde.

&gt; ive experienced the good times, and the bad. ive experienced 
&gt; becoming part of a family of whom i never knew existed and our now 
&gt; a huge part of my life and always will be.ive experienced new 
&gt; friendships and bonds that will stay with me for life. ive had so many 
&gt; good times, and so many good laughs. ive experienced becoming part 
&gt; of a completely different culture, living in a foreign country, learning 
&gt; a new language which in the end is just like home. you have your 
&gt; friends, family, you know your way around, you are capable of doing 
&gt; everything on your own.

Ich habe gute Zeiten erfahren und schlechte. Ich habe erfahren wie es ist Teil einer Familie zu sein von deren Existens ich vorher nie gewusst habe und die nun ein großer Teil meines Lebens ist und immer sein wird. Ich habe neue Freundschaften und Bündnisse erfahren, die für immer mit mir sein werden. Ich hatte so viele gute Zeiten und so viel zu Lachen. Ich habe erfahren wie es ist, teil einer komplett anderen Kultur zu sein, in einem fremden Land zu leben, eine neue Sprache zu lernen, was am Ende so wie zu Hause ist.
Man hat seine Freunde und Familie, man kennt seine Umgebung, man kann alles eigenständig erledigen.

&gt; without experiences i dont know who i would be, and with 
&gt; experiences still to come i dont know who i will become.

Ohne (diese) Erfahrungen weiß ich nicht wer ich wäre, und mit den Erfahrungen die noch kommen weiß ich nicht wer ich mal sein werde.

&gt; ive experienced the experience of a lifetime, one that has opened my 
&gt; eyes and changed me completely, an experience that simply cant be 
&gt; understood without experiencing it yourself. ive experienced germany.

Ich habe die Erfahrung meines Lebens gemacht, welche meine Augen geöffnet hat und mich komplett geändert hat, eine Erfahrung die man nicht versteht ohne sie selbst zu erfahren. Ich habe Deutschland erfahren.

Nah, I'm just talking out of my ass here. But since I'm already at it, the true winner of this election was Tsipras. This was the best possible outcome for him, and he knows it. I don't think he actually intended to win. It's simply not possible that somebody with the political talent to grow a party that quickly, even under those conditions, understands so little about European politics to truly believe he could have delivered what he had promised. No, I think he set everything up to become an effective opposition inside and outside of the parliament, and to boil the new government on medium heat. Enough to be the clear alternative and to make sure they look as bad as possible without actually collapsing, but not too much. He needs them to do the dirty work to get Greece out of the immediate crisis. He's a populist, he'd lose all his political capital if he tried this himself. It's much easier to give the established parties enough rope to hang themselves. That's why they'll try everything to get him to join a ""government of national unity"", so he can't mobilize the people, but he won't fall for that.  
All he has to do now is to remind people how he would have spared them the unpopular policies, and when the next election comes, he'll win in a landslide. He's young, he can wait, and this way there will be a country left to govern and no established contender in sight.

true,ChemicalPleasure,NETH,The Netherlands,"The way I see it there are two realistic options;

1. Greece and (inevitably) other similarly ill-fated nation leave the euro and either reintroduce their old currencies or join together to form a new weaker currency that they can then communally devalue as needed. This would usher in an age of two ""euro's"". A strong northern one and a weaker southern one. Both unions would recover from the crisis a little faster than before and people do not starve in the streets as seems to be the case now. Consequently the southern euro would mean a back-track to the old system where the north followed the DM and where the south would in an unending cycle periodically devalue it's currency. Democratically this would be sound as the elections in Greece seem to indicate that this sort of system is what Greeks (and quite possibly the residents of other PIIGS nations) like best.

2. The EU is thoroughly restructured, actual honest-to-god Euro parties are created electable by a direct vote. There would be a christian democrat party, a labourparty, a libertarian fraction, greens etc. This euro-parliament could elect a euro cabinet with spending power in all of the EU. Eurobonds would exist as a natural consequence of this democratically elected and accountable government. Greece and the other economically weak nations could benefit from the strength of the others. In return all local governments would be subjected to thorough and -if need be- invasive checks by the euro government. In essence this would amount to a more democratic version of the USA in Europe.

However, it's possible to come to the conclusion we're being screwed without reference to bad newspapers. The financial transaction tax speaks for itself, for example. It will disproportionately hit the UK above other European nations, and the tax will be used to shore up the collapsing Euro - a project that the UK did not want to be a part of because we thought it was a bad idea. We already have banks threatening to move to Hong Kong or Singapore if the tax is enacted, and the last thing we want to do is push ourselves further into recession because of a mess not of our making.

The problem is that our finances are quite bad because of the developped welfare  (I don't say it is bad - I say it is quite expensive) and with te social reforms promised many wonder how we will be able to catch our target deficit.

For the top tax, your point had been backed by the right: if we raise the taxes, people will flee and we will have less money. Yet for the PS, it is a major symbol of social solidarity during hard times and it is not aimed at making much money.

Everybody in Europe is loosening labour laws to help the growth. So here in France we won't do it. There will be talks with trade unions before reforms but 2 of them have already been anounced:
* ""Emplois d'avenir"" : 150k  full time jobs for the young with a salary equal or above the legal minus wage. 75% of the wage will be taken in charge by the State ( idk if it's still going to happen because I don't think we have enough money to pay this)
* ""Contrats de générations"" : in France, welfare is funded by both the worker and the boss: the firm pay a tax call ""cotisations patronales"". When a firm hire a young but keep an older worker that could go to retirement to ""train"" the young, the boss won't have to pay the *cotisations patronales* for the two workers. On one hand it can help reducing youth's unemployement and elederly's poverty. On the other hand some say that instead of hiring two new people, bosses will use a ""contrat de génération"": it will cost a lot for the State (no more *cotisations* ) and won't help reducing unemployement.

Random notes...I lived in NYC for five years, and in Paris most of my adult life. I like Paris better. It's a beautiful and safe city with a pleasant climate. Of course it is full of Parisians-- a challenging but rewarding group. My best tip to you is... flirt or joke with everyone you can. Parisians are not believers in ""the customer is always right."" But they appreciate people who make an effort, love New York, and are incredibly helpful when they want to be or when you really need them.

There can be a lot of truth in stereotypes. Americans are loud and wear t-shirts and big white sneakers. They often don't know much about French or any other European culture and not only aren't embarrassed, but act as if they are proud of that. It's fair to say that a lot of French people assume most Americans are uneducated, badly dressed, fat and boorish, and the number one stereotype is to call Yanks ""big children."" They usually sort of like them in person, because Americans are friendly. But this behavior that would be thought charming in a Mexican, Thai, or African is usually looked down on as shallow and hypocritical in an American. 

People won't be rude because you're American, but they might just be rude because they're not into being nice and in France you can act like that without many personal consequences. Watch a French movie and you will see a bitchy heroine. French people can't get fired for being rude to the customer-- in fact it's very hard to fire someone for any reason at all. Since the boss can't fire the employee, he will side with the employee against you if there is a problem. Saving the employee's face is key to resolving any service issue. 

When Disney tried to recreate American friendliness at its Paris park, it got jumped on by French media for trying to enforce a slavish subservient mentality. The idea that default friendliness is nice, not hypocritical or slavish, is not a French one. Parisians feel you have to *deserve* good treatment by being worth their while. 

I think you have a good attitude and will do just fine in Paris. Don't turn into one of those Americans who's constantly putting their own country down, either. That's just as dumb and naïve as criticizing France constantly. The French expect you to behave yourself and know the rules-- which you won't at first, since you're not French. Just keep your eyes open and when in Paris, do as Parisians do.

true,Jasfss,null,null,"(US Citizen, and before I start, let me say that in no way is this trying to be a ""Go AMERICA/DOWN with Europe"" post) I would agree with you on some of those points. Still, while I agree comparing US States to whole European (or for that matter, any) COUNTRY is a hard thing to do, I would also argue that US States are each in their own way, a whole different, unusual, and unique identities. And even on top of that, I would never, ever ever, treat the European continent as ""Europe"". To me, that makes it sound like it's just Australia, and this one big chunk of unified people, when this, argue me if you like, has never been and is not the case, whereas the US is, in fact, a unified entity.

While there are regional classifications of culture to the US (for instance, New England, West Coast, East Coast, South, etc), there too are unique gems within these regions. While there is the greater southern region of the US, there is also Louisiana, and for the sake of argument, really New Orleans, a city that fits right in with the American South's culture (shaped by a long history of slavery and peoples of African descent), but also has this flair brought about from the relocation of French-Canadians. Or in Texas, where six countries all held claim of the lands at one point in time, and with its unique border culture to Mexico. 

I'm not arguing that European countries don't themselves have diversity like this WITHIN each country, but I'd argue that the diversity is not quite as varied domestically, for a multitude of reasons (not the least of which being the smaller sizes of European countries and their tendencies to keep out other peoples from their countries in history). But take for example, Italy (this being the European country I have the most experience with, having family hail from there). There's the North and the South Regions, alright. And then what? A few cities shaped by their times as city states (Rome, Florence, Venice, and chuck a few more in there) that are unique within the regional scapes, but not really much else, without going very specific into details of differentiation.

So yeah. Europe is diverse, be proud of this. But don't take a Euro-Centric view on things, that's my real issue with what you say, try and open your definitions a little bit more. And I'm not even just talking about the US. Look to somewhere else, like China (virtually non-existant in Western History and only touched by the West in small areas before the latter half of the 20th century) where there's such a ridiculous amount of diversity, it would make your head spin. It's so diverse, Chinese people can't even understand Chinese people from different parts of China, there are so many vastly different local dialects. And religious worship ranges from Buddhism, Daoism, Catholicism, Islam, Ancestral worship, and more. Be nationalistic, but don't put that above everyone else's nationalism.

I've spent 3 years in this subreddit. I initially came in here as very pro-EU, but after 3 years of various nationalities spouting off about the UK, I am much more lukewarm about the whole thing. 

The biggest issue I have is the notion that the UK should just go along with everything that France and Germany demand of us. It seems that whenever we don't, we are being *obstructionist* or *anti-EU*, rather than simply having different ideas about where the EU should be going. *That* is a form of thought-policing. It is saying ""You must have our opinions, and not deviate from them at all"". It doesn't seem like there is any room for negotiation for us. For compromise. We are just expected to tow the line, and when we don't, everyone gets angry. What baffles me most is that this does not seem to apply to either France or Germany, they seem to be able to do as they please without anyone making a peep about it.

Train is a bit expensive on Spain, especially when going from Madrid to Barcelona, Valencia, Malaga or Sevilla, as there are high speed lines, but you won't have that problem from Oviedo and your choices will be less.

Your only option for train is [Renfe](http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/index.html), the national train company. You can look for the [timetables and prices here](http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/horarios.html). Your train is going to be around 50€ and 5 hours long. It will arrive at Chamartín station, if I can remember correctly. From there you can ride the commuting train (Renfe Cercanías) or the subway (Metro Madrid) to almost anywhere. Chamartín-Sol (right in the centre) is only 2 Cercanías stops away.

Your main (or only) option for bus will be [Alsa](http://www.alsa.es/en/buy-and-schedules/national/?searchType=common). The price for the basic ticket will be around 30 euros and 6/7 travel hours. But if you wanna go 'pro' you can get a [Supra+](https://www.alsa.es/en/services/supra/?searchType=clase&amp;tipoBus=supra) class ticket which is faster (5 hours) and get WiFi, no seat neighbours, more space for your legs, headphones, electrical outlets, drinks and a snack half the way (a sandwich or something similar). This is no Greyhound, I can assure you... You should arrive to Estación del Sur (Mendez Alvaro), where also you can pick the Metro or the Cercanías, although there are some buses that also stop in Madrid-Barajas Airport.

I usually prefer the train, but if you wanna rest a bit, you may prefer an Alsa Supra +.

Demzufolge müsste man den dialektischen Materialismus für falsch halten, bloss weil der real existierende Sozialismus historisch versagt hat (mal ein Beispiel unter vielen denkbaren).

Wiglaf Droste, den ich im Übrigen sehr schätze, hat natürlich auf diese verkürzte Art Recht: Ja, auch dem ""ärmsten Schwein"" kann Identifikation mit dem Vaterland zur inneren Aufrichtung dienen, genau wie das Klammern an eine Religion, oder Ideologie oder Subkultur usw.

An A Zone Normal card is 51€. A ""joven"" card is 33€.

A young card may take some days to be done, but now, with the new contactless cards, it may be requested in before over the internet. Check http://www.tarjetatransportepublico.es/CRTM-ABONOS/entrada.aspx . Also, the new contactless cards don't expiry on the end of the month but, 30 days after you buy the subscription. So if you get a month subscription on the 15th, it will expire next month 15th.

For ""Normal"" cards you still cannot get contactless cards. You'll get your card done in the moment in almost any ""Estanco"", that is, the official tobacco shops in Spain.

I played rugby union and cricket for amateur teams in Edinburgh; half the teams were Aussies and Kiwis.  Not a Bavarian in sight, despite Bavaria being a mere few hundred miles away.  Everybody in the UK and Australia can tell you what Ramsey Street is, or who lives in Summer Bay.  Can the average Bavarian?  We share the same language, share the same head of state, share the same system of government.  Not a single one of those is true for Bavaria.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;The financial transaction tax speaks for itself, for example. It will disproportionately hit the UK above other European nations,

Germany feels it has to pay disproportionally for the financial crisis, the southern EU states feel they have to shoulder disproportionally much of the immigration burdens, Poland feels it's disproportionally disadvantaged by the climate policies due to its coal plants, the small states feel they're being passed over, the big states feel they're constrained by the small ones, idem dito for poor/rich states, etc. etc. That's everyone's story.

Concerning the expediency of the tax, is it so illogical to use taxation make the financial sector pay back somewhat for the crisis they bred, and rein them in to prevent the next one as well?

&gt;and the tax will be used to shore up the collapsing Euro - a project that the UK did not want to be a part of because we thought it was a bad idea.

The same goes for almost everyone European project, but the UK joined anyway because not joining would be worse. It's like the uncle who always tends to get into disagreements with everyone at family dinners, but somehow always turns up again the next time. The thing is, the UK is a part of Europe by geographical ordinance. It's not a matter of choice. The UK will *have to* deal with the rest of Europe; the only choice is how.

&gt;We already have banks threatening to move to Hong Kong or Singapore if the tax is enacted and the last thing we want to do is push ourselves further into recession because of a mess not of our making.

true,akie,EURO,European Union,"Ok, so it seems that we are both just projecting earlier opinions of other people on each other.

Let me preface this by saying that, after having lived in the UK for a while, I am just extremely fed-up with a lot of the mindless anti-EU blathering that I heard while I was there. If I have been projecting that frustration upon you, I apologize. But since that mindless anti-EU blathering is so very common in the UK, it was easy to make that mistake.

Having said that, I am not of the opinion that the UK should just go along with whatever France and/or Germany propose. However, I am also not of the opinion that the UK should just obstruct everything that comes along and cry foul whenever the EU proposes something that doesn't directly benefit the UK. See [the whole Cameron debacle from last March](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17230760), for example. Is that obstructionist? Anti-EU? Yes, both, and the only reason Cameron ""vetoed"" that was to 
appease his internal opponents after having been put under pressure for weeks. Had he not used his veto, he would have been put away as ""selling out to Brussels"" and having helped Germany establish the Fourth Reich. Do you think that's an exaggeration? Because it's not. Never mind that his ""veto"" was of no consequence and that he himself is now actually saying that ""[a fiscal union is not enough](http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20120607-43023.html)"".

You see what I mean? Instead of playing a positive role, he plays an anti-EU and obstructionist card that buys him (and the UK) nothing but reduced influence. And the reason he is doing that is because there are so many British people that are borderline xenophobic when it comes to Europe that he almost doesn't have an alternative.

Go eat a pizza [Da Michele](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZntS3Hw2SY) it's the oldest (or one of the oldest) and best pizzeria in Naples.

Keep more than an eye on your wallet/purse/backpack since neapolitans pickpokets are the most skilled in the world. Don't trust ANYBODY in crowded areas, not even little kids or young girls. Don't buy Iphones or other luxury goods at ridiculous prices from street vendors. They'll swap the phone like a skilled magician and you'll walk away with an iphone box with a rock inside, true story.

Go visit a pastry shop (pasticceria) neapolitan sweets are wonderful. [Sfogliatelle and Babà](http://coca-cola.donnamoderna.com/media/u/ricettario/30408e3ee665eff612adbc8456d885c6.jpg) can't be missed.

The Veiled Christ is an amazing sculpture located in the small [Chapel of Sansevero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappella_Sansevero). The veil looks so real somebody say it's almost a miracle. 

An incredible location is the Ancient underground graveyard called [Cimitero delle Fontanelle] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontanelle_cemetery)  if you're not easily scared by skulls and bones don't miss this unique place in the world.

true,filip_latinovicz,CROA,Croatia,"&gt;my only guess is that they're pretty patriotic.

Why do you assume that this has to be in opposition to each other. This map is very deceiving because it presumes that everyone assumed the same thing under ""Europe"". I can assure you that Croatian society is still ""pretty patriotic"" and that overwhelming majority of those saying they ""feel European"" does not put their European identity higher than Croatian one. In fact, I'll dare say that if you asked them to rate the significance of their identities (national, regional, supranational etc) European one would be at the bottom. I think we would find out a lot more if the survey included a question to rate the significance of ""Europeness"". :)",0,1340064531,null,0,1340065183,0,c52de3n,t3_v89qm,t1_c52de3n,t1_c5277zq,null,1429173883,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"Even leaving aside the cause, I think it's pretty clearly true that nobody has proposed a workable solution. I'm not sure exactly why, but I would guess lack of political strength and consensus. Instead we've gotten a series of stopgap measures that nobody really believed would solve anything, and unsurprisingly, they haven't solved anything.

I don't think the idea of restructuring Greece's public sector is a bad one overall, though I think it's not so much its size/pensions/etc. that's the underlying problem, but corruption and general inefficiency. Greek public spending pre-crisis-spiral was not too high as a share of GDP (lower than e.g. Denmark, Sweden, Germany, France), but the main problem is that the public institutions just don't work well, and small businesses (which were a large percentage of Greece's economy until the current crisis) have a hell of a time getting anything done. Denmark's public sector is huge and very expensive, but it works pretty well, which is the real difference. So it needs to be fixed so that Greece can build up a more substantial economic base.

As far as I can tell, there weren't any real credible transition plans, though, proposed by anyone on any side. Significant restructuring of a government could *maybe* be done on a really accelerated pace over, say, a few years, if you want something that's going to work and stick. And if you want to transition more things to the private sector, there needs to *be* a private sector, not a recession-death-spiral that sends all the businesses into bankruptcy. But instead we got these 6-month packages kicking the bonds *just slightly* further down the road, which ended up not really resolving anything at all, except pushing the problem into 2012 (which is where we are now).",0,1340064786,null,0,false,0,c52dg43,t3_v8z6g,t1_c52dg43,t3_v8z6g,null,1429173908,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13
