true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Do you not think that a popular regional assembly would be able to push for increased powers? If the people in a region can get a referendum on an assembly, then they can surely get a referendum on a stronger assembly.

As I said above, they do not have the ability to choose to secede from the Union if things don't go their way. They are toothless organisations. 

&gt; Who exactly are you asking to offer England a referendum on devolution? If, as you say, England is desperately crying out for a devolved parliament, surely it would be able to find some way to offer itself a referendum. Last time I checked, England had a substantial number of MPs sitting in Westminster.

What on earth do you think the West Lothian question is about? No one in parliament likes the suggested solutions (such as an English Parliament), and so they dither and do nothing. Westminster knows that an English Parliament, and any form of resurgent English nationalism would be problematic for the Union. If the Scots can ask where all their oil revenue is going, then England can start asking where all the cash from, say, the City of London is being spent. An English Parliament is a potential threat to the Union, and that is why England was only offered regional assemblies. As all the major parties in Westminster are effectively unionist parties, none of them want to admit what the only remaining solution to the West Lothian question is, because they don't like the answer. 

&gt; The problem you are glossing over is that ""England"" as a single entity with a single mind, really doesn't exist. It will never agree with itself long enough to make anything like a single English parliament a reality.

That's a bit of a daft thing to say given that England has been a nation for over a thousand years. I'm really not glossing over anything, and I really don't think anything *other* than an English parliament is realistic in the long run. Give it a few years, with the further devolution of powers or the beginning of the break up of the Union, we'll see an upsurge in English identity, and with it corresponding political fallout. I think it's already too late for a Federal solution, which would have been my preferred choice, and so my bet is now that we're looking at 3 separate nations on this island before the century is out.

true,GretaForge,null,null,"I second the about.com recommendation.
I started learning German once with some nondescript online course and stopped after a week because of case frustrations. I decided to try again and looked on about.com and stuff made more sense.

After reading through the 20 [introductory lessons](http://german.about.com/od/onlinecourses/a/An-Online-German-Course.htm), I found I knew most grammar stuff and could go out and learn mostly independently, mainly focusing on growing my vocabulary and listening/speaking skills.

For vocabulary, I'd recommend memrise.com, the wonderful flashcard site someone else mentioned already. It shows you some new words, along with cheesy puns to help remember their meanings. You are then quizzed on the words a few times, until they pass into your long-term memory, and to keep them there you need to review them every so often. I've found it to be a great help, although it only builds your passive vocabulary, so you'll need to practice using and seeing those words in sentences for them to become useful for you. For that, I recommend eventually keeping a diary in German.

Another site I'll mention is yourdailygerman.wordpress.com
The writing style of the author is a bit annoying (IMO, of course), but it has very detailed and in depth (although not quite daily, maybe weekly) explanations of specific words and concepts.

Finally, although I suspect a large number of the reddittors here speak German, this reddit won't have a lot of stuff specifically related to the language. There are [some](http://www.reddit.com/r/LANL_German/) [subs](http://www.reddit.com/r/GermanPractice) intended for learning German, and in those you'll find interesting little tidbits and better replies to questions about grammar or usage.

And I love this idea because there is no race (we can argue hours about this). but it doesn't mean that this word doesn't exist, establishing a distinction based on race is forbiden and the word ""race"" do exist in french law. Racial discrimination is punished with 45000€ fine or a year of jail, it's just sometime hard to prove

Concerning what you say on news presenter that's a little exagerated Harry Roselmack was indeed the first black maintreem presenter but you have to consider a few things there was (in 2005) 5 free chanels in france TF1 FR2 FR3 FR5 M6, M6 doesnt't have any good TV news 
FR3 is a regional channel which already had immigrant presenter.
The only two channel left are TF1 and FR2, those two channel already had since a long time plenty of non european reporter and journalist
But there in Only about 3 or 4 news presenter for each channel.

I'm really bad at math knowing that about 5~6% of the french are black, that a News presenter last around 30years (yes really) on his post, think that you still have significant chance that no black presenter actually make until 2006 without being a proof of discrimination.
The fact that Roselmack has been appointed because of his skin color has never been proven, and if it was the case it's stupid, im totally against *positive discrimination* because (i'm mixed) I personnally don't want to be hire because of my color of skin, this is insulting actually.

We can't know that because counting people based on their ethnics origin is completely forbiden in france, but according to the Insee based on the data of the immigration people from africa, (including north africa) represent around 12% of the population, Asian community is less than a percent

The status of ""citizen of the colony"" used to grant to these people some kind of second rate citizenship but it wasn't actually based on race. you say that Gaston monnerville has not been properly elected president but we had several MPs and important men way before 2006

true,Platypuskeeper,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;If Scandinavian countries would participate more actively in Europe

What makes you think there's any room for that? Sweden and Denmark have fewer MEPs than Romania alone. Scandinavia (with our without Norway) has little voice in the EU because of our relatively small populations. We try, nobody listens. Which is hardly unexpected given that the bloated bureaucracy of the EU can't even manage to reform even the most obvious and outrageous wastes, such as spending hundreds of millions of euros a year to move the damn parliament just to placate France's ego.

&gt;Unfortunately, societies with high levels of Social Capital also tent to be more isolationists.

Oh? Yeah, the Nordic countries are such big isolationists that we had free trade, free movement of people, and a customs/passport union, _decades_ before the EU and Schengen existed. Without all the overhead and bureaucracy of the EU, or with people ending up feeling voiceless or disenfranchised about it all. Scandinavia already _had_ a currency union a century ago, and already found out that that wasn't a good idea. If the Nordic countries are so isolationist, why is the complaining about the EU and never about the Nordic Council? 

'More involvement' isn't going to fix anything, especially when many if not most Scandinavians feel the fundamental structure of the whole EU organization is bad, and _don't_ feel that a European federal state is the answer. If anything, the problem is that it's too federal to begin with. The main anti-EU parties in Sweden (e.g. the Left and Greens) are not against European cooperation at all. They're anti-federalist, not isolationist. It's nothing like Tory/right-wing anti-Europe sentiment in the UK.

As there was no other way to get at the money my parents were shelling out I also visited confirmation classes. *That* was an experience... not in the religious sense, but realising that 99.9% of what the pastor was talking about was social studies, that out of 20 students there there was one actual believing kid, and that 18 of those 20 had a real need for some social studies lessons. It was a strange feeling, sitting in the same boat as the believer.

The Quran, the Bible and the Torah are probably the oldest complete books we know. They were not meant to be used like they are today. They were meant to be a mixture out of survival guide and explanations for the unexplainable. I think that's the right time to loosely quote Bertolt Brecht's Galileo ""If you work on your farm the whole day until old age and your whole body aches because of the hard work the only thing you've got left and that keeps you going is your believe in heaven and a better afterlife"". Mekka was a big brothel around 600. The Islam implemented some kind of rules through the Quran. Women with headscarf weren't extremely religious people. It was a sign that they aren't prostitutes or to have to a quick fuck. Every woman next to Muhammed was a strong woman and not suppressed by her husband. The Quran implemented war laws the UN implemented over 1000 years later. 

The bible is even more easier to understand? Remember the story where Jesus got mad and kicked a table in a temple because the Jews were making markets inside the temple and fucking around with people? Jesus was the Che Guevara of the first century. Today, we say that somebody has huge balls if they did something awesome. Back then, it were wonders. 


Today: ""This dude has so huge balls that he could beat a cow to death with them!"" (nobody says that but you know what it means)

Back then: ""This dude is so awesome he has fed a lot of people with a few breads and a few fish"" (don't know the exact numbers)

Every one of those ""holy books"" is full with such things. Full with explanation for horrible things nobody could explain and full of stories of this awesome dude who has the biggest balls. Full of things you shouldn't do (today we've got Bear Grylls. Back then, the Quran said that you shouldn't eat pork because there is no refrigerator to prevent it from spoiling) because it could be dangerous, barbaric or just not appropriated. 

The problem is not the book. The problem are the people who use the book as fact. Jesus and co would rotate in their graves if they'd know what people do today. ",0,1345027331,null,0,1345027767,0,c5tgd12,t3_y8jb0,t1_c5tgd12,t1_c5tfrt0,null,1429643773,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

In all honesty it's very sweet of them to be concerned about your welfare but Italy is a country like many other in the 1st world (but the food is better) and it is populated by roughly a majority of nice folks and a very very small minority of arseholes and people out to steal your organs.

Europe has a long history of beating the shit out of itself. Currently we're all working together and putting all that xenophobia aside, but it seems to me that things are getting slowly worse with the ongoing bailouts. Radical groups are getting more support, nationalism is becoming excessive, arguments are carrying more vitriol.

People have legitimate concerns about who is paying what to who and why they should be footing bills. Of course those are legitimate. It seems all of us are paying for one thing or another. Either our country is bailing out other countries or our country is being bailed out. Either way we are finding ourselves with increasing taxes and decreasing services. In both cases the average joe citizen is not at fault and yet their life is being made hard. Annoyance at that is perfectly legitimate and it is only right that we have these discussions about what is best for ourselves as separate nations.

But while focusing on these details and the struggles of here and now we must not lose sight of where we have come in the last 60 years, or the last 100 years. It's not that long ago that German and French and British and Irish and Finnish and Italian and all the rest were killing eachother in droves. We cannot return to the way things were. 

I'm not saying that Finland or Greece or Spain would cause a war by leaving the euro. That's crazy. But I do think that if we all jump back into our shells, start using our own currency and put back up our walls, we'll leave a colder and more hostile place for our children and their children to live in. We'll start a downward spiral and we know where it leads. It's not good.

The future of not just europe but the whole earth depends on increased cooperation, increased openness and support, increased communication, and a shared heritage. I think the EU is a fantastic example this - of a beneficial alliance between old foes. The day it begins to disintegrate will be a sad day for all of us. It will be a regrettable waste of huge potential.

Eine solche könnte nach Art. 4 Abs. 1 GG - unbeschadet einer etwaigen theologischen. Legitimierung im innerkirchlichen Bereich - nicht Grundlage der Kirchensteuerpflicht sein. Zunächst ist schon durch die Anknüpfung der Kirchensteuerpflicht an die in einer evangelisch-lutherischen Kirchengemeinde vollzogene Taufe hinreichend sichergestellt, daß ein Kirchenangehöriger für die Kirchensteuer nicht ohne oder gegen seinen Willen der steuerberechtigten Kirche zugeordnet wird. Für den Regelfall der Kindestaufe erklären die sorgeberechtigten Eltern die Bereitschaft zur Erziehung des Kindes in diesem Bekenntnis. Dabei wissen sie, daß diesem Akt herkömmlich die Bedeutung der Zugehörigkeit zu der entsprechenden Kirche beigemessen wird. Daß damit nicht auf den Willen des noch unmündigen Kindes, sondern seiner sorgeberechtigten Eltern abgehoben wird, beeinträchtigt nicht das Grundrecht des Kindes auf Glaubens- und Bekenntnisfreiheit. Insoweit handeln die Eltern kraft ihrer Eltern Verantwortung für das Kind, das ihrer Hilfe bedarf, um sich zu einer eigenverantwortlichen Persönlichkeit innerhalb der sozialen Gemeinschaft zu entwickeln (vgl. BVerfGE 24, 119 [144] = NJW 68, 2233) und sein Grundrecht auf Glaubens- und Bekenntnisfreiheit noch nicht selbst ausüben kann. Belastende Rechtsfolgen für das Kind werden an die Taufe in der Regel erst in einem Zeitpunkt angeknüpft, in dem es die Religionsmündigkeit erlangt hat und daher jederzeit durch Austritt seine Mitgliedschaft beenden kann. Wird die Mitgliedschaft gleichwohl aufrechterhalten, so liegt darin ein Element der Freiwilligkeit, das es ausschließt, von einer Zwangsmitgliedschaft zu sprechen. Eine darüber hinausgehende förmliche Beitrittserklärung nach Maßgabe der Vorschriften des bürgerlichen Rechts ist verfassungsrechtlich nicht erforderlich.

Most likely because once food is passed it's expiration date, it's been deemed unsafe to eat by either the manufacturer or the government, depending on who is in charge of such things. They normally tread on the side of caution.

I absolutely think that the food should find it's way to shelters and the homeless as much as possible if it is truly safe to eat, but liability being what it is makes it quite difficult for it to get there via officially supported means.

I think the specifics here matter. The hypothetical person in your next paragraph is a strawman of sorts: We have no idea if the person owning the grocery store is anything like that, and without that information we can't even tell if your example is applicable here.

&gt;Lets look at this another way. Spanish Man A is a successful businessman who takes home $150,000. Is it fine to rob him to feed your family? Society has in large said yes, and they do it through taxation, which is then distributed to the safety net programs. When government fails, goes bankrupt, people stop paying taxes etc, I don't think it ethically changes the situation to take matters into your own hands when the instrument of state fails, as long as you steal responsibly(I know, but it does happen when good people are driven to bad acts).

On my side of the pond comparing taxation to robbery is typically used as an argument *against* taxes, not as an argument *for* robbery.

&gt;If you really want to match the analogy to robbing a store like this, it would in fact be comparable to a sales tax. 

No, because the businessman *has a say in his government*. He has representation. He can make his case. He can't do that with random looters and thugs. He has no social contract with them, because he has no say in what they do.

&gt;I wouldn't approve of a sales tax in this case, and for gods sake, I'm not approving of robbing supermarkets just yet either, just of robbing people with too much money.

I really don't like this. Your problem doesn't appear to be *how* the person earned their money, what they did, whether they've paid their due in taxes already, or anything like that...it's just that ""*he has hit and I want it*"". There's no moral stand here, no justice being served. Just jealousy and anger.

The Judicary capital can be Hague given its historic importance with justice, it's general neutrality and the fact it would generate tourism and international reconition of the city.

The Executive should be based in Berlin primarily because the German government has produced the most stable economy and nation in Europe and is generally good at management. Berlin is also the capital of Germany so making it the EU executive capital would be relatively easy. Tourism wise Germany is considered a strongly government based city with deep political history and amazing architecture to base the executive in.

The Legislature should be located in London, this is due to the historic importance of parliamentary democracy beginning in London and the fact most of the euro sceptic Brits hate the eu due to laws being made in Brussels. You will never get the uk to fully support the eu unless it has some form of what it consideres power, primarily with law of which the British love to debate and have had a strong history of stable law processes, London is also a world city which gives it Presteige on the world and European stage.

Personally the idea of making a small and unknown city such as Brussels a capital of a federal European superstate is simply asking for trouble, the majority of people have likely never herd of Brussels and as a result it has little historic importance of passion for leadership. To unite Europe we also have to unite our history and cultures, thus a tertiary capital setup would solve this by uniting the most powerful cities and regions of European history together.

Given the choice between someone buying themselves a new coffee table and someone buying their starving family a meal, the option with higher utility is feeding people first. In my view jealousy and anger are justified if the first case is taken.

Would you apply that same utilitarianism to someone protecting what they had earned?

I know it's different in Europe, but here(well, for most states) if you break into someone's home to steal, we are legally allowed to assume the worst; that they are going to harm you and your family. We can defend ourselves with that assumption in mind. If we're working on a strictly utilitarian basis, this could be taken even farther.

&gt;I can't help but wonder if your opinion of not robbing people would change if you were a person from Africa and needed to eat. Try applying the veil of ignorance.

I'm actually pretty pragmatic when it comes to this type of thing; I will certainly break the law if I'm out of money and need to eat, but I will do so on the blackmarket and with voluntary transactions.

It's more of a scale. Drinking alcohol isn't cool under Islam for example, but it doesn't automatically mean you'll burn in hell for all eternity.

I agree with this. Sure, expansion has had many unintended consequences and drawbacks, but expansion is still in the mutual interest of applicant states and the EU. Who knows what the countries of Eastern Europe would look like today if they had not joined the EU. They still have their problems, but I think it is better to have been brought under the wing of the EU in order to consolidate democracy and market economics. The Balkan countries present many similar problems as the countries from Eastern Europe. Historically a troublesome region of modern Europe, integration and supervision by the EU should finally change the dynamic. Lastly, expansion really is at the heart of integration.

You imply that when people are kept separate from eachother because of their characteristics (sex/race/etcetera) that one of the two (or more) groups is better than the other(s), while really it just means that the groups are different. For example: do you derive the notion that girls (or boys) are of less value than the other sex because they go to different schools? There is absolutely no fundamental reason for them to be separated, but it's pretty common.

true,VallanMandrake,BAVA,Bayern,"Fürstenfeldbruck? That is were I am from (well - the village Alling).

If you like the porsche museum - you should really, and I mean REALLY visit the ***German Museum (""Deutsches Museum"")*** [Google for some images](https://www.google.de/search?q=deutsches+museum&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:de:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=de&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=lEwsUNXxLOTP4QSLqIHwDg&amp;biw=1157&amp;bih=713&amp;sei=mEwsUKqqJu_P4QSR5oCAAg) (even if you hated the porsche museum, you should visit it). Try to view some shows (they are free, but only once or twice a day) in the museum, they do things like high voltage lightning (meter long lightning arcs... really cool!) or freezing things with liquid air (really cool, litteraly... and fun to watch) ask somebody at the reception.  It is in munich (buy an MVV (train) ticket for the day and visit everything by train/subway, in munich, you won't find parking spaces easily).

Other important things (well the German Museum is the best, and most unique^^) in munich are: 

* the major's building (?) (das ""(münchner) Rathaus"") 
* the womens church (die ""Frauenkirche"")
* the ""Hofgarten"" and the ""Residenz""

The above are all in the pedestrian's district (""Fußgängerzone"") in munich's center. Walk through it to get an impression of the city.

* **the ""Oktoberfest"" lol, almost forgot that. It is in September VISIT IT!**
* the Olympic Stadium (das ""Olympiastadium""), it has an unique architecture
* the English Garden (der ""Englische Garten""), a nice (BIG) park to relax (Right next to ""Hofgarten"")
* the art Galleries  - only if you like art. 
* the ""Hofbräuhaus"" - I was disappointed going there, but everybody knows it, so go there...
* some normal ""Biergarten"" where you can eat your Bavarian food (""Leberkäse"", ""Weißwürste"", ""Schweinshaxen"" etc...) the Biergarten does not have to be in munich (Fürstenfeldbruck has some, too), but it should be one where you can eat under trees (which is necessairy for that name, and the flair)
* probably sth I forgot because I live here...^^

Other than munich there are some nice things:
* the ""Schloss Neuschwanenstein"" world famous ""casle"" in Bavaria - I think you do not need to enter it, just go around it, the area is beautiful.
* the ""Schloss Herrenchiemsee"" famous ""casle"", the interior is similar to the casle versailles. Beautiful area. (Bavaria)
* Travelling by car: The river Rine - there is a legendary road google it, the landscape is beautiful. Really. Watch for bikers, there are a lot, scince the road is one of the most famous biker tracks in the world.
* If you are travelling north through the Ruhrgebiet (Nordreinwestfahlen) try to see a giant mining machine- forgot that name, hopefully somebody can help...
* the North Sea, especially the ""Watt"".
* Some things I forgot, like the cities
* Berlin. See it. The Berlin Wall. The egyptian museum. The political center (walk through it). 

Things you should really eat:
* Bread. REAL bread. There are many different flavors - all of them are really different to what amricans (and you probably too) call bread... Which is called ""Toast"" here...
* Bavarian specialities: ""Schweinshaxen"", ""Leberkäse"" (no cheese or liver in it, btw), ""Weißwürste"", Beer (we got different flavours), ""Kartoffelsalat"", ""Wurstsalat"", ""Fleischsalat""...
* ""Curreywurst"" from some street imbis in the middle of germany.
* ""Döner"" best buy in Berlin - cheap and good. It is not german, but spread, and it  is good... ;-)
* All sorts of ""Wurst"". 
* Things cooked with potatos (like cooked potatos...)


That is all I can think of. For the things in outside of Bavaria, you should probably take advice from somebody form there. Or your bride...

true,mars20,null,null,"Im just copying my post from another thread, Bayreuth, Würzburg and Nürnberg are close to Bamberg (about 30-50min on the Autobahn each)

**Bayreuth:** 
*[The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)
*[The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see

**Bamberg:**
Whoo, where should I begin? 
* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique german medivial town centre. Actualle the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  
*The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope north of the alps.
*Right next to the Cathedral, there is the ""Alte Hofhaltung"" where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers
*The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""
* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above 
* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) (Attemted Hitler assasination, movie with Tom Cruise) had his horse-regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006.
* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;hl=de&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=18)  as you'll have a superb view over Bamberg and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food. 
*Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;num=30&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=de&amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;t=h&amp;z=17)
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right and enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg
* There is also an quite large US Garrison, so you won't have problems speaking english ;)

I forgot the [Sandkerwa](http://www.sandkerwa.de/bildergalerie/) which is a beerfest / kermesse in the centre of Bamberg during 23.-27. of august. Like Oktoberfest, but smaller, cozy and with one bar/club next to each other and a huge party on the streets in front of the clubs. 

I dont know how much time you are planning to spend there, but if there is almost no time: Old city hall, and then right to the Spezikeller ;)

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.
* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.
* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (only i the weeks before christmas)
* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.
*Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe
*[Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp; culture. But i believe this would be a little bit too much ;)

If you have more time &amp; are into nature (well, not canadian nature without population... ;)):  [**""Little swizerland""**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A4nkische_Schweiz) and try some local beer, almost every village has one brewery, there are villages with 1000 people and three breweries (Guiness woorld record: 1500 poeple, 4 breweries)! Also very nice if you want to see some more old [castles](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Burg_Pottenstein.jpg) ;)
If you are into climbing, thats the area to go. Former world's hardest climbing Route, the [Action Directe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Directe_%28climb%29) is located there.
This area has the highest density of *Breweries* world wide with about 80 breweries in an area of about 50 x 50 km², and also there is the highest density of *Bakeries* and *Butchers* world wide, and it's a very cheap to live are ;)
There are many very beatiful [villages](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Judenhof%2BTurmkarst_T%C3%BCchersfeld.jpg) and [caves](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Bingh%C3%B6hle-350.jpg) you can visit too.
If you are interested I can give you some more recommendations on that area too. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/jgfLs.jpg) is a shot i did a few weeks ago. On this hill was one of the oldest settlements in the region, first settlement is dated back to neolithic age, about 4000 B.C., and around 500 B.C. there was a large castle and it was the centre of the region. You can still see some recunstructed walls of that time.

I dont know how much time you want to spend there, BUT DONT MISS BAMBERG! ;)

If you need more information on that area, feel free to ask! :)",0,1345104759,null,0,1345111389,0,c5tz3h6,t3_ya47t,t1_c5tz3h6,t1_c5tx225,null,1429652807,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

Usually you pronounce it like it's written, as soon as you know how the letters are pronounced in german, you should not have problems. Of course there are some rules like two vocals are pronounced long, like vocal followed by an ""h"". So ""Saarbrücken"" would sound same as ""Sahrbrücken"". Also if there are two consonants, the vocal in fron of them is pronounced short. And ""ck"" is like ""kk"", so the ü in Saarbrücken is short. ""Sch"" is like english ""sh"" in ""shut"" for example"".

From what I have heard from many people I have spoken to in vast array of industries, breaking off from the EU would be slightly more beneficial than staying within. Sure, the benefits of free passing between countries and light trade laws between EU zones is great, but not a lot of people are happy with the fact that the currency value is depreciating due to certain EU members not knowing what the fuck an economy is or how to sustain it. Due to that, the already underpaid salaries in Finland are much worse now - I am earning less per hour as an IT administrator than when I was doing first year aged care in Australia.

On a political side, the Real Finns party would argue that being a part of something 'failing' in comparison to a solely 'successful' 5 million person country is a silly idea, and having a currency that is not *self sustainable by the country of use* is turning out to be a horrible idea. 

That being said, being a part of the EU simply does nothing more than create an unsustainable shared currency, political arguments of economic factors and mass immigration from gypsies and lower-class citizens from the poorer EU state - thus spending *your* hard earned tax money on *their* government support payments.

Do not degrade your own country by saying you can't do this or that, and that being a part of the EU allows Finland to do much more. Fuck that for an idea.

Nokia wasn't developed during the EU times, and its success has nothing at all to do with the EU. Angry Birds was Finnish owned and developed, again, nothing to do with EU. Finnish currency has dropped in value and prices for everything have increased, thanks to the EU. Immigration policy has allowed a mass influx of under-educated, non work capable citizens to flood the streets - thanks to the EU.

Its not like Germany (and Finland, and others) isn't already paying for job creation in Hungry and other countries in the east and south. There are EU fonds that go to areas with less industry and development. There has been for decades. Some countries like Ireland use those fonds successfully. Others, like Greece, not quite so successfully.

It seems to be easy to just blame everything on the more successful countries instead of adjusting the policies at home.

The problem is not job creation, the problem is the salary difference for the same job, when you graduate if you have the opportunity of earning 3 or 4 times what you can earn in your country, you will move, no matter if there is also a job in your country. This is nothing you can fix with good policies.

In the EU there is nothing like that when you move from Hungary to Germany you are only contributing to Germany, Hungary invested in the education, and sees no return.

It depends on which areas you walk. You will not see open hostility although there's a good chance to bump into groups of skinheads idling around the areas of immigrants just to ""keep an eye"" on them. 

There is a lot of fear and a lot of tension among the various groups of people in Athens. Being living in the city for the past 30 years of my life, I see the difference in the eyes of the people. People are afraid and suspicious. 

&gt;What has not helped is the level of violent crimes that have risen against Greeks (in homes and businesses) and have got nation wide coverage. These crimes have been blamed on foreigners and this would also sway public opinion.

Propaganda is working very well to create the appropriate scapegoats. Recently there was a crime against a taxi driver, he was brutally killed. There was much uprising since it got nation-wide coverage on the fact that it was ""foreigners"" that committed the crime. 3-4 days afterwards, the police finds out that a Greek was involved. Suddenly the nation-wide coverage of the crime stops and vanishes from the news. 

Fascism always relies on good Propaganda. We have one of the best :P

true,adlerchen,null,null,"Yup. Hundreds actually. Some of them are now mutually unintelligible. Some cities have their own dialect like Berlin (Berlinerisch) or Cologne (Kölsch). In other cases the dialect crosses national borders like Alemannisch which is in Baden-Württemburg and Switzerland. There's even differing opinions on which ones sound good or bad among Germans. For example, Germans are very likely to make fun of Saxons for their accent, and supposedly Pfälzisch is in vogue right now according to a podcast I heard a while ago. Berlinerisch is another disliked dialect, and even a lot of native speakers of it find it ugly. xD

Personally my favorite dialect to listen to is [Kölsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6lsch_dialect) because it's really sing-songy. Also, like many other north-central dialects like Berlinerisch the g-sound shifted to the y-sound, which I find really cool. For example, *jenau* instead of genau, and *Jelbe* instead of Gelbe.

You don't have to worry about dialects being a problem if you visit their country. Almost everyone speaks Standard German (Hochdeutsch), which is what you learn in textbooks and mostly see in the media. Except for some elderly who only speak their regions dialect, of course. In Switzerland, they learn Hochdeutsch in school like a foreign language, but they also have their own regional dialects.

I hope this has been an informative explanation. :3

If you're interested in learning more, Deutsche Welle has a great series on German dialects called [Landeskunde](http://www.dw.de/dw/0,,12377,00.html), where they go over the major ones and have a 15 minute podcast discussing them and giving examples of local color and slang. It's all in German though, so you kinda have to be at the B2 range or higher to get a lot out of it, but it's still really informative and good practice.
