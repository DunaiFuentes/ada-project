I took a look at what the DIRECCTE is. It's a public body in charge of all things relating to work and business in France. There are no DIRECCTE offices outside of France.

[This website](http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/F2729.xhtml) explains the necessary procedure to obtain a DIRECCTE authorization. The application for your authorization has to be filled in by your future employer and submitted to the proper authority (much like in Canada). This entails that you should have found a job before going to France if you want to be admitted in as a worker. I assume you haven't looked for jobs yet?

Anyway, I'm afraid you'd be short on time if you wanted to get it before the 21st. 

Your best bet right now is to go to France as a tourist (no visa needed under 90 days), do **not** tell them you intend to work. If you do find work, then your employer can start a procedure for you to get the authorization (and get your status changed from tourist to temporary worker).

I hope this helps clear things up a bit for you.

true,crackanape,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; Right, so if I call you a kankerhomo, that would make you infantile. Haven't thought this one through? Or am I missing something here?

You are missing something. I only become infantile in that situation if I start whining about it, rather than ignoring you. ""Mommy, he called me a name! Put him in jail!""

&gt; We all know where the line is and what the consequences are when you cross it. Then start insulting the officer who fined you for it because you get caught... It was completely and utterly your decision and your responsibility breaking the law. Whining about it is weak and insulting the officer is infantile. Just shows you have absolutely no respect for the laws of the society you live in.

What are you talking about? As I said, I don't swear at cops. I consider it pathetic behavior to swear at cops.

I am simply saying that I also think it weakens respect for the police to have a law that allows them to lash out in retaliation at people who swear at them. If the police want our respect, they should be above nonsense like that. To me, this is more important — and more damaging — than some yahoo lobbing a few curse words. When the police, who we are supposed to trust and rely upon as people of strength and honor, reveal themselves to be so puerile and petty, the whole system starts looking shaky.

Just because something is dumb or pathetic doesn't mean it should be illegal. Sometimes it's better to let people act like fools for the sake of the greater good.",0,1337131024,null,0,1337131296,0,c4oix2t,t3_to8be,t1_c4oix2t,t1_c4oiiwj,null,1428933396,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

€49bn out of the bailout funds were used to recapitalize Greek banks after the default. Everybody was fine with that. Keeping the banks functioning is part of the plan, after all. Also, Greece hasn't even attempted to sell government bonds for about two years now. If banks still wanted to buy new bonds, we wouldn't have to bail them out in the first place.

&gt; If the ECB insures deposits and everyone runs, the ECB needs to print huge amounts of euros, which when they hit the street, will turn into hot potatoes, producing a massive inflation.

I was under the impression that you actually reduce money supply when you withdraw cash. It doesn't really matter anyway, because they would simply introduce a legal limit to the amount you can withdraw or transfer out of the country. 

That said, Greeks have withdrawn/transfered some €700 (edit: ~~bn~~ *millions*) on Monday, the usual rate had been about €2bn/month recently.

that it's a destroyer. Turned inside of the double side coverage for a bow shoot to the last steamer. By dodging a fish trawler which came into sight in the nick of time, the distance grew too big and the cutoff angle too sharp. Backed off underwater. The convoy steered at 340° and consisted of 9 rows of about 4-5 steamers of 5-5,500 tons. On the side that I had attacked, I saw about 11 escorts including the safeguards in front. 

The escorts were zig-zagging, the steamers went straightforward. My belief after the experiences of the last day is that in the current situation success in this area is up to chance. Thus I aim to steer toward Chicken Rock tonight and go from here to ? to perhaps catch steamers going to Glasgow. Depending on the weather, I want to be on the route Wicklow-Holy Head or at *Hooka* Hill the next morning.

true,kyr004,CYPR,Cyprus,"yeah. because most people, including the European policy makers, the ECB, the IMF, believe that the bailout deal is non-negotiable. 

But the Greeks are essentially taking a huge risk, by putting all their hope into a belief that with enough support, with a willing government, they can push for the bailout deal to be altered and negotiated under different terms which will ease the austerity on the Greek people. 

It is essentially a huge gamble; they think Merkel and Schauble are bluffing when they make references to leaving the Eurozone. They think a compromise can be reached.

So when lots of people see the Greek election results and say ""The Greek people don't understand what they want. They want to stay in the euro without a bailout loan"", this is a gross misinterpretation of what the Greeks want (that quote is something that Theodoros Pangalos said. He was deputy Prime Minister until last month and he basically lied about what the results show.)

The results of the election show that the Greeks have found austerity unbearable and want an alternative, and believe an alternative is possible.

Of course, if the Greeks vote into power anti-austerity parties but Germany was not bluffing, and no negotiation of the bailout is actually possible, then Greece is screwed.",0,1337152110,null,0,false,0,c4on24t,t3_tpjkz,t1_c4on24t,t1_c4om4yu,null,1428935343,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

In all seriousness, rent is way more expensive, depending on where you live (and expats living outside the main metropolitan centers, such as they are - mainly Zurich and, sort of, Basel and Geneva) tend to be miserable.  It is not a hugely exciting place, although large bits of it are lovely.

Your main advantage is if you earn an ""upper middle class"" or higher income (let's say 100,000 CHF or more), or want to start a business.  This, incidentally, is a large part of what's driven up rents so much - there was a construction recession in the 1990s/early 2000s, and now there aren't enough apartments for all the foreigners working for big companies that relocated to seek the low taxes and stability of the Swiss Franc and the general economy, compared to the rest of Europe.

There are good sides (it's pretty, relatively close together, safe, efficient, the schools are good, everything works) and bad sides (it's pretty limited and boring, can be a bit xenophobic although that's changing, often incomprehensible and irrational to foreigners, the language is horrible, it's expensive).  All in all it's a good place to live if you're a fairly successful professional, I'd say - not just because of the taxes, which _do_ make a hug difference.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I'm sorry that you can't do whatever you want

Whatever I want? you should back your presumptions by a quote where I state such desire, or be a bit more attentive if we're to have a conversation. 

&gt;Police can only 'pester' you if you actually break the law. 

Not at all true. eg a friend fond of late-night walks at the park, which isn't illegal in any way, still ended up hearing ""I can stop you every 5 m and ask for your ID again and again if I want"" at some point from a police officer, after politely complaining of being continuously pestered each night, merely for this habit. And ofc, by law, the policeman is right. Quite a waste of taxpayer's money though, for no useful purpose at all.. 

Another would be threatening a friend he'll be arrested for listening to a concert  from a public park (which one should pay for if one were to go into the hall next to it, and the city had some % of the tickets) Which is simply an illegal act on their part. Luckily he didn't react angrily. and ofc who is supposed to enforce the law against them here were they to hit him?

On the other hand, much of the effective rules of the law depends on the dynamics of its application. So for example, use of 'soft drugs' in the Netherlands is by the books, a misdemeanour punishable by a fine. But non-enforcement of the law is what makes it affectively allowed. Similarly, the priorities in enforcing the laws define much of the actual shape of the law. 

Now were the police to selectively pester dis-privileged people for 'breaking the law' such as for smoking pot in the Netherlands (or supposedly throwing a can as in this case), I hope you wouldn't consider ""you can only get into trouble if you break the law"" just so credible an argument.

&gt;&gt;    They are also extremely dangerous employees of the state, given that they are authorised to use force in some circumstances.

&gt;This is a straw-man argument. We are talking about penalizing offensive behavior, not about the use of excessive force. 

That's actually not an argument at all, its simply a constatation. One you don't seem to be denying.

A quick recap on logical fallacies: a straw man's argument is one where the opponent's position in the debate is misrepresented so as to be easier to shoot down. Yet I wasn't even presenting your position, merely describing the nature of the service.

This is actually the argument: 

&gt;&gt;For this reason, it is essential for them to be under strict control of the public. Something not at all trivial if expressing anger, possibly justified, at their possible abuses is in itself illegal.

I don't see what's specific to the excessive use of force there. (possible use of force is simply their defining feature in the government bureocracy - the repressive organs of the state was I believe their marxist description - and one which would make me weary of protecting them from speech and scrutiny in general ); it would seem to be just as true for any other abuse of authority, like the case from this article. Which is in fact a case from your country. I'll get back to this at the end of the reply, for I think most of it is missing the mark. Otoh, I was more angry than clear in my post, so am myself to blame for this loss of focus...

I'm simply far more worried about the abuse of power if left insufficiency checked, then about the feelings of those wielding it - and the latter can easily conflict with the former. And dragging someone to court for an insult is the police exercising their power just like use of physical violence would have been.

&gt;We need someone taking up this role of police, otherwise we can't have a functioning democracy.

I didn't suggest the police shouldn't exist at all. Just not as a constant street presence, or at a particularly intense level, since that's pretty much never useful, and regularly makes the citizens, esp those of low social standing, like this homeless man, convenient punching bags for their frustrations or prejudice or boredom.

And that they need to be under close scrutiny of the citizens, much more so than vice versa, since they're potentially much more dangerous, as this article after all demonstrates.

&gt;How does this protect them? It doesn't.  ... This is not about protection. It is about respect for the law.

Again those high words devoid of any content. 


&gt; . It's majority rule, and not a 'do whatever you want' rule

If this were the whole story of it, then it would be the dictatorship of the majority, not a liberal democracy. Free speech is certainly one of those civil liberties where the individual act is regulated, if at all, much closer to 'do whatever you want' than to being decided by a vote.

---------------------

But in any case, most of this is just digression. The point is simply this:

&gt;It is about respect for the law. And if you don't agree with them embodying the law, then I'll change that to the people who are upholding the law. We need someone taking up this role of police, otherwise we can't have a functioning democracy.

so to translate.

'it is about respecting the people who are upholding the law'

and why?

'we need someone taking up this role of police'

Now, tell me please, how is this not a blatant non sequitur? 

How does A, the need for laws forbidding saying insults to the police, follow from B, someone needs to do the job of the police? Do you expect policeman would just quit were they to suffer insults anyone else is liable to suffer? Really, people that are prepared to deal with potentially violent opposition would find handling words too much for them to stomach? 

Well, come to think of it, I do have the impression most would have trouble stomaching a mere compound sentence, so perhaps they would have more luck managing violence than words...

But to get back to the non sequitur:

First. police are not the only ppl enforcing the law - all and any government bureaucracy is. Yet are singled out for such protection. So if A followed from B, then there would be no ppl in jobs that aren't so singled out for protection against expressing negative opinions of them. I can imagine so many ppl being thrilled at hearing that their insults have made all the bankers of the world quit out of offense!

Second. Laws on free speech, which unlike this nebulous concept of respect for bureaucrats really is central to a functioning democracy, generally make no exceptions for hurting people's feelings (only for damaging reputation, with factual and false claims, if those can cause financial damages, in libel laws). 

So the prima facie case that anyone's speech should ever be limited by the feelings of (or indeed respect for) others needs to first be made. This is the 'do whatever you want' territory par excellence in any liberal democracy!!

Only after making those points should I have ventured into arguments why the police are exceptionally unsuited for any such additional protection.",0,1337161265,null,0,1337162429,0,c4onvwh,t3_to8be,t1_c4onvwh,t1_c4oeuf6,null,1428935733,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I can't judge Berlin (I currently live in Cologne) but I hear awesome things, aside from the weather.  It used to have a reputation as not having much in the way of jobs, but as far as coolness and things happening go, I am of the understanding that it's where it's at.  What I would avoid in Germany like the plague is living outside one of the bigger metropolitan areas (Cologne, Hamburg, Munich e.g.).  I'm not in the loop about prices in Berlin, but yeah, I understand much of it is cheaper than places like Frankfurt or Munich.

Out of curiosity, why German?  Unless you're into literature and history, it's not a very useful language.  You'd be much better served with French or Spanish (German native speaker here...)  I mean, do what you gotta do, I'm just saying...

Switzerland is good for some things, and not just if you work for a ""Swiss"" company (in that sense it's quite international).  In a lot of ways it's comparable to the Netherlands - pretty, works fairly well, reasonably international.  But that also goes for some of the negatives, like people being pretty uptight and stubborn, and many foreigners get a vague, irrational sense of unease living there, that I can't really put my finger on.  Much of Germany also has that ham-handed bureaucratic bullshit - if you can navigate that, you're gold.  

But for the income levels you're talking about, I would totally forget Switzerland.  It's just no feasible.  You'd stand to gain absolutely nothing - so yeah I'd look into Berlin.

First, if the university you are going through provides you with options, I recommend taking one of them. Makes things infinitely simpler as the school has done the majority of the work.

Second, there are several agencies within Paris that you can go through for housing; understand that you'll have to pay a fee which can add up to one month worth of rent.  Here are a few options: [Lodgis.com](http://www.lodgis.com/), [SeLoger.com](http://www.seloger.com/), and I'm sure you can find others via the internet.

Third, I have heard a few people have success with Craigslist in Paris, but I have also heard more stories about people being scammed.  Just use the same kind of sense that you would use when dealing with a long lost Nigerian relative.  It's worth an effort, but generally for self-listed apartments, they require your physical presence to meet you in person.  Another website, like Craigslist, that people use is [PAP.fr](http://www.pap.fr/).  It is more reliable than Craisglist, but scams are still possible.  

Finally, I found my first location in Paris through [SabbaticalHomes.com](http://www.sabbaticalhomes.com/).  Very reliable, but some of the locations on this site can be very expensive.  Mainly because they are more for vacation rentals.

I would recommend researching all your options, but understand that with the second and third options you will have to have a lot more information upfront to give to the landlord.  Most of the legal rights in France reside with the person renting the apartment, not the landlord.  Therefore, landlords are a lot more ""picky"" when it comes to who they rent out apartments to.  I had to provide a CV, bank documents, proof of income (if not possible, guarantee of funds via letter from family, plus their bank statement), recommendations from previous landlords, and basically anything else that would make me look like a good tenant short of a blood test.  This can be a bit daunting, but in reality it is no different than looking for a job.

Price depends on where you get situated.  The more central you are in Paris, the higher the price and smaller the location.  Sometimes you'll find a nice price for a place within Paris, but then realize that it is on the 8th floor with no elevator, or does not have bathroom included with the room (communal bath in hallway). If you take the time you should be able to find something nice, otherwise, I recommend going through an agency or your school and leave it up to them.  if possible, take a trip out here early so you can spend a few days looking at what is provided.

You do realize you are coming to paradise, right? You're going to find two months is waaaaaay too short a time. :)

Your accent will give you away in microseconds, so if you plan on talking you have no possible way of going incognito. Don't even try. Make an effort to speak French and learn to laugh at yourself. 

French fashion is varied and complex. The guys pay way more attention to their fashion than they do in the States (or at least more than the guys out West where I'm from). In general the ladies dress well if they are going to be seen by anyone outside of the house. Don't change your wardrobe for a two-month visit, but don't wear white tube socks and sweatpants out in public either. :)

Try to talk quietly when you're out at restaurants. Our accent makes us LOUD, and the French are frustratingly discreet in public. If you want to talk loud, Italy is only an hour and a half away. ;-)

You'll find customer service is a total nightmare and strangers may seem cold and stand-offish. It's cultural, so don't let it get under your skin. In general the French are very polite but won't make an effort to play friends with people they don't know. (In fact, our tendency to do that strikes some of them as false and shallow behavior.) 

Airmail kisses are the appropriate greeting for friends and acquaintances, otherwise it's a handshake. We do two kisses here in this part of France. The Swiss do three.

&gt;Après la victoire dans la bataille de Fort Beauséjour et la prise de Fort Gaspareaux, en juin 1755, Lawrence ordonne aux commandants de Beaubassin, Pisiquid et Annapolis Royal d'attirer les hommes français de leurs districts respectifs au fort ou à l'église locale pour que les « instructions du roi » leur soient communiquées; une fois sur place, ils étaient encerclés, puis arrêtés et détenus dans des bateaux. Ils allaient être déportés à l'extérieur de la province et leurs possessions allaient être confisquées par Sa Majesté. Des navires principalement en provenance du Massachusetts viennent les chercher. En attendant les bateaux, les femmes et les enfants restaient chez eux et devaient fournir de la nourriture aux soldats et aux prisonniers, mais certains d'entre eux furent tués sans nécessité. Les déportés sont divisés par groupes d'âge et de sexe, puis embarqués sur les navires où l'on prenait soin de démembrer les familles. En tout, de 8 000 à 10 000 Acadiens seront déportés d'Acadie.

et

&gt;Des historiens américains estiment que, sur une population totale évaluée entre 12 000 et 18 000 Acadiens en 1755, de 7 500 à 9 000 périrent entre 1755 et 1763, soit des effets de la déportation, soit en tentant d'y échapper.

Retaliation doesn't have to take the same form. If one child throws mud at another, and then the second child kicks him in the knee, that's still retaliation. 

It becomes retaliation as long as it's a reaction designed primarily to hurt the offender, motivated by the offense of the retaliator.

&gt; Impolite people deserve to be fined imo. I just wish police officers who say 'je' instead of 'u' to adults would be reprimanded aswell. Too many impolite and uneducated police officers nowadays.

J'ai mon lot régulier de French Hate en direct. Je dirais un par tranche de trois semaines passées aux US. Le truc qui au début ma le plus désarçonné, c'est que cette haine (le plus souvent déguisée derrière la fameuse question ""Why do you guys hate us?"") vient de tous milieux, incluant ceux qui ont fait bcp d'études, education irréprochable. Cette fameuse question, si tu creuses un peu, cache un sacré lot de griefs sans fondements.

Ma théorie c'est que c'est principalement une mode. On est facile a détester. Peut être que la plupart de ceux qui vont dézinguer les français ne savent pas placer la France sur une carte pour commencer (ce qui ne démontre rien mais pour avoir des arguments contre quelque chose, autant s'y connaître un minimum pour être crédible).

Moi les bras m'en tombent à chaque fois. Un cas typique, arrivé récemment à NY, je discute avec un couple de tres bons amis de ma femme, donc normalement les mecs devraient déjà pas me sauter dessus, par respect pr leur amie, mais bon passons :
- why do you guys hate us?
- ... wait, what? Say that again?
- yes why do you hate us?
- wow, why would you ask such a question to me?
- we've been in Paris for a week, people spat on us while we were on a cruise on the Seine
- oh.. where did this happen?
- on the Seine at Notre Dame

Voilà, j'ai creusé, et à part peut être un garçon de café acariatre à St Germain, rien trouvé d'autre. Donc ce couple dont les deux sortent de Columbia et Georgetown excuse du peu, sont persuadés à vie que les français les détestent, eux, parce qu'une bande de teenagers touristes allemands leur a craché dessus du haut d'un pont, dans un district ou les parisiens ne mettent les pieds que pour aller faire la queue à la préfecture.

But others tend to compare it to how the situation in Greece would be, had there been no bailouts at all. Each side focuses on the measures that *they* have been taking, and that the other didn't.

Greeks fear more austerity in the future and believe they haven't received enough help, but the Eurozone fears just as many years of constant instability when the electorate expresses that it won't accept deep cutting reforms by electing Syriza, if they give in to their demands. There could be no faith in even renegotiated terms being final, and in future reforms actually getting implemented. Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy have done very impressive work in regards to reforms, and they would deserve more help as well. On top of that, the Eurozone needs to retain spending capacity to intervene should anything go wrong in one of them -- e.g., because of a collapse in Greece.

Here's an interesting quote from Syriza's European policy spokesman:

Seriously, you are ignoring all the benefits just because of some secondary effects that can be quite easily overcome. This is going to happen either way. Saying that everyone should just pack up with 10 foreign languages instead of using the same one is absurd.

Before I end this nice discussion. I would like to point to another part of free speech that is punishable by law, which is racism. I think holocaust denial too, in a few European countries at least. There are (and there should be) restrictions on free speech. 

I framed my argument because respect is actions based on deference. Which is accepting the authority that the police has over you. If you don't accept that authority and you show that by insult, you are in essence going against the grain of democracy.

Question is if that should be fined. I say yes. Because such action is penalized in our society. 

You say it is added protection. I say it's the same as driving through a red light. Well, that's crude. But in essence, you should respect the authority of a red light. If you don't you get fined. Same goes for an officer; you respect the authority of an officer, if you don't you get fined. My argument has nothing to do with protection. It's about respect and it's about living in a democracy.

If this was about protection I would argue for tanks and machine guns? I really don't think you and I are going to have a difference in opinion why that would totally not be suited for the police. Additional protection isn't necessary. And I don't see this insult law as added protection.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_the_United_Kingdom

&gt; In its accession treaty to the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973, the UK was obliged within five years to incorporate into domestic law all EEC directives, including the use of a prescribed SI-based set of units for many purposes. By 1980 most pre-packaged goods were sold using the prescribed units, the conversion having either been voluntary or made under UK-initiated legislation. The mandatory use of prescribed units for packaged goods only took effect in 1995 and for goods sold loose or from bulk in 2000. The use of ""supplementary indications"" (non-prescribed units given alongside the prescribed units) was originally to be permitted for a limited period only, but that period was extended a number of times and in 2009 the ""sunset clauses"" relating to the use of supplementary indicators were removed.

&gt; British scientists, philosophers and engineers have been in the forefront of the development of metrication – in 1668 John Wilkins first proposed a coherent system of units of measure, in 1861 a committee of the British Association for Advancement of Science (BAAS), including William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), James Clerk Maxwell and Joule among its members, defined the units of electricity in terms of metric rather than imperial units, and in the 1870s the firm Johnson, Matthey &amp; Co manufactured the international prototype metre and kilogram. However the British Government has been lukewarm in its support of the metric system and, in the words of the Daily Telegraph, the British public lacks cultural empathy with the system.

&gt; As of 2012, metrication in the UK remains partial – most of government, industry and commerce use metric units, but imperial units are officially used to describe journey distances, vehicle speeds and the sizes of returnable milk containers, beer and cider glasses and are often used informally to describe body measurements and vehicle fuel economy. At school, the use of metric units is the norm, though pupils are taught rough metric equivalents of those imperial units still in daily use.",0,1337174538,null,0,false,0,c4op7a0,t3_tptf1,t1_c4op7a0,t3_tptf1,null,1428936354,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

I didn't say that, I said that Italian dying would be a bad thing, not that people learning English would be a bad thing. How is this not getting through to you? Is English not your first language?

Homogenous language will lead to a homogenous culture. We have heaps of recent examples of languages dying because they weren't used anywhere but the home. Look at the languages of Aboriginals in Australia or the Languages in PNG, the diversity there is ever decreasing as time goes on because communication is easier, people are less isolated and a tribal language is not good in a wider context.

You have misunderstood the nature of the word ""destroy"" in this context, I am not saying that the death of Latin brought down buildings and destroyed books, I am saying that the death of Italian will bring a large scale import of foreign culture, TV shows which will be more popular and not about things going in Italy which will lead to an increasingly homogenised world.

They would need to get the new Drachma out and restrictions on money leaving the state literally hours after dropping out or risk a total collapse.

They would also probably have to nationalize private pensions to even think about keeping the public sector propped up.

Il y a moyen de monter en statut mais c'est plus difficile maintenant (à l'inverse, une dégringolade est trop facile). C'est pourquoi on voit des mouvement comme ""Occupy Wall street"". Dans l'ensemble, la situation économique est meilleure qu'en France et tu peux relativement facilement bien gagner ta vie.

Insécurité : c'est clair, c'est pas bon. A Tulsa, il y a un homicide à peu près chaque semaine (pour une ville de 300,000 hab.). Ceci dit, ça reste concentré dans certains quartiers. Je n'ai jamais eu de problèmes et je ne me suis jamais senti menacé. (Ayant pris le métro, bus, RER pendant tant d'années, je ne peux pas en dire autant de Paris...) Tant que tu sais où ne pas aller et le genre de personnes à éviter, pas de soucis. Il y a aussi des coins où le taux de crime est comparable aux villes européennes (Seattle, par exemple).

Religion : Je ne crois pas en dieu... et ça n'a jamais été un problème. La religion est omni présente seulement si tu y pais attention. Et il y a une grande diversité, entre baptistes, mormons, TJ, catholiques, juifs, musulmans (si si), etc. Même en Oklahoma, les américains sont bien plus tolérants qu'ils n'y parraissent.

Immigration : ça dépend quelle route tu prends. Pour moi, c'était l'équivalent du regroupement familial. Ca a pris au total un peu plus d'un an, pas mal de paperasse, d'argent. Ce que je sais, c'est que tu ne peux pas juste décider de partir et t'installer. Si tu restes plus de 3 mois, tu dois avoir une raison particulière (et un visa correspondant).",0,1337177075,null,0,false,0,c4opmng,t3_tpa2b,t1_c4opmng,t1_c4oofwf,null,1428936554,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

It's hard being hegemon.

&gt; But EU is as much a responsibility of others as Germany.

If this sentence means anything at all, see above.

German prosperity depends, in a large part, on the EU and the euro.  As the most economically powerful state in the EU, the Germans succeeded in creating a monetary system that reflects German neuroses (Weimar inflation) and German habits with money (sticking cash in the bank rather than investing).  This monetary system had huge (and deleterious) effects on economies constructed along different lines.  Not worse, just different.

Now that, unsurprisingly, this state of affairs has started to benefit Germany and affect the other countries negatively, Germany has shown an almost total lack of empathy and leadership.  They have laid down a stark line: be like us, or fail.  This is not what the EU was supposed to be about.

Butthurt rants like the one above demonstrate the problem.  Germany is an economic giant, but a political pygmy.  The size of its economy makes it the indispensable country in the euro system, but its political hangups (understandable, given the deep repression of its history), and provincial, introverted politics make it incapable of leading the EU, or even admitting the validity of the other side's point of view.

This narrow, dogmatic inflexibility, and reflexive defensiveness and thin-skinnedness may be characteristic of the German political character (at least as projected beyond its borders), but it is a bad parody of the kind of leadership Germany would need to demonstrate in order to save the euro system, which is very much in its own interest.

The joke is that the  English of course, after getting the Greenwich meridian, never adopted the metric system.

You don't really know what hegemony is, or you are under a serious misconception about the power balance in Europe. Is Germany the largest economic power? Yes.

And I don't even need to get into a long, detailed explanations why Germany is far from being in such a dominant position, a simple question to you will suffice to show that you are wrong: 

Why, if Germany is and was in such a dominant position, possessing nearly total power over the EU as a whole, was the Euro introduced **against** German wishes, more precisely: both against the wishes of the then-administration (Kohl) and against popular opinion, in return for French support for the unification? The rest of your argument will fall with your inability to answer this simple question.

true,nestoras,GREE,Greece,"A few short points:

&gt; It seems to me as if Greeks tend to look at their present situation in contrast to life before the crisis, so from their perspective, the rest of Europe isn't doing enough.

It's not called a 'bailout' or 'a rescue package' in Greek. Nobody here thinks that Europe is 'bailing' us out of anything. It is widely understood that the vast majority of this money is being used on nothing other than paying back *interest* on Greece's previous loans (i.e. making already rich people richer). This is the general sentiment anyway.

&gt; I don't think it has been communicated well enough how very real that risk actually is.

Most Greeks understand pretty well that risk by now. Greeks have always been very pro-Europe but (like Europeans on the opposite side) are quickly getting fed up with what is seen here as a largely immoral (not to mention unbearable) situation. Greeks would rather stay in Europe, but there comes a point where you simply say 'fuck it, I've got nothing else to lose'.

Since both sides believe they are right or mostly right, there is obviously a failure in communication here. The real pity is that the vast majority wants a shake down of waste and corruption (as demonstrated by the recent elections) and an exit from the European Union and a return to the Drachma is not very likely to help with that. We'll have to see, I guess.

2. Two democratic states have been subverted, due to external pressure, chiefly from Germany.  I refer to Italy and Greece.  That the constitutional forms of those countries were preserved is beside the point.  That is a hegemonic act.

3. German pressure on the peripheral states is intense, and is applied both to the people of those countries (via the media, and Merkel et al's political statements) and to their politicians.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; It is widely understood that the vast majority of this money is being used on nothing other than paying back interest on Greece's previous loans (i.e. making already rich people richer). This is the general sentiment anyway.

This perception probably comes from the previous crisis, but those aren't investment banks making high risk bets for big profits (with the exception of those that bought Greek bonds on the secondary market from those who decided to cut their losses since the crisis began, but that's really just a small part). They don't waste their capital on government funds that barely beat inflation, Greek ten-year bonds only yielded an average of 0.27% more than German bonds from when Greece had joined the Eurozone up until the financial crisis hit in 2007. This isn't the stuff rich speculators buy when they want to make a quick buck, but what banks and insurers use as collateral and what retirement funds buy as a secure long term investment. 

Since the default on those bonds still held by the private sector, the (by far) largest holder of Greek debt are European tax payers, either through the EFSF or the ECB. They're effectively paying the share that goes into paying the interest on the now publicly owned Greek bonds to themselves, and the interest rate that Greece pays is tied to what the other Eurozone countries have to pay to borrow that money themselves.  
What still pays interest on the remaining bonds held by the private sector is dwarfed by the €100bn they had to write off after the default. Of those bonds, the vast majority is held by Greek banks. Some €50bn of the bailout funds had to be used to recapitalize those banks after the default.

Se si smette di utilizzare l'Italiano in certi campi del sapere, come l'ingegneria e le scienze, la lingua smetterà di evolvere e aggiornarsi in questi settori, o non lo farà più allo stesso ritmo di prima. Questo porterà - nel lungo periodo -  ad uno svantaggio evolutivo: si utilizzerà di preferenza l'inglese semplicemente perché possiede la terminologia necessaria a descrivere la realtà, mentre l'Italiano sarà condannato all'obsolescienza.

Just to explain to the non-Italian redditor: In an average 60-minute lesson, most of the time is spent talking *in Italian* about the lexicon and the grammar (and, in some cases, literature), in the same way they teach Latin. Very little time is dedicated to strictly English discourse.

When it's time to speak, little emphasis is put on spontaneity; kids are taught to rehearse on the same pieces of dialogue, on the same kinds of description.

And as classes are getting bigger, every kid is given less time to try speaking in English at school. (Also, sorry to say that, but most English teachers are excruciatingly bad, and I know from experience.)

But I don't think that late learners can't get better at speaking a foreign language. They can if they get constant, *good* education.

Yes, it's possible to live and work in Germany with English alone, e.g., as an engineer or other kind of highly qualified professional, but most jobs require you to be fluent in German. Most speak at least some English, but by far not everybody, so any job that requires customer contact or working with other low qualified workers is pretty much ruled out. If you only stay one year, then any position that requires more than rudimentary training is out as well.

They're all safe. But cities are only cheap if there aren't enough jobs, and it's worse if they're cool. Take Berlin, for example. Cool, yes, and still cheap for a city of its size.

Same thing other way around. Who is to decide when it is wielded wisely? That is a job for the society as a whole, through the channels that we have available for us to do so (political and judicial systems). One random person on the street can not and should not be able to decide on when an officer over-reaches his responsibility. 

There are of course officers who have difficulty with knowing where the line is, but there are also people who have the same difficulty. At least our officers get trained to know these things. We, in the Netherlands, don't have a police force that is excessive in its behavior. We are not Americanized in that aspect. Not to say there are no incidents. 

You focus on individuality, I see it more as whole systems.
I personally would want to swear when I decide someone is an over-reaching officer. But you speak about abolishing this law and things then work for an entire society, not only for you and your friends. But also for prisoners, criminals, problem-youth, tokkies, etc. Everybody is equal in front of the law. 

So that's where I think the differences between us are mostly, you take the more individual approach, I the whole system approach. Is that a fair assessment?

Anyway JS is a lot beeter than its reputation. I'm assuming your JS was browser side. Do some jQuery ... that removes all the DOM shit and makes JS fun. Particularly look at the ajax bits. 

Then when that's blown your mind go and look at a framework called meteor where a web app is JS server and client and you don't actually have to do the sync stuff. Make a js function make html to list the contents of a server side table and when the table changes 'hey presto' your html table changes. No writing ajax, no synchronisation, the framework knows 'this client side html table is based on this db query - so when the db changes I need to push the changes to the client'.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Interessanter Kommentar, jedoch halte ich einige Punkte deiner Darstellung für schwierig.

Zunächst einmal schilderst du *deine persönlichen Erfahrungen* mit Ritalin und deine Entscheidung gegen das Medikament (die ich gut verstehen kann). Was ich jedoch argumentativ probematisch finde ist, dass du deine persönlichen Erfahrungen generalisierst (""es macht total gesprächig"", ""man fühlt sich total verklatscht"" etc) und es so darstellst als wären die Wirkungen, wie du sie erlebt hast bei jedem Ritalin-Patienten zu erwarten. Dem ist nämlich nicht so. 

Ich beispielsweise (um eine weitere persönliche Erfahrung zu nennen) habe keinen dieser spezifischen Effekte bei der Einnahme  erlebt. Die Wirkung von psychoaktiven Medikamenten wie Ritalin ist von Patient zu Patient sehr variabel und hängt von zahlreichen äußeren sowie personenbezogenen Faktoren ab. Auch der Placebo-Effekt sollte hier nicht unterschätzt werden - gesteigerte Konfliktbereitschaft/""Mut"" wie du sie beschreibst wäre beispielsweise eine sehr unübliche Folge von Ritalinkonsum, was an der hohen Wirkungsvariabilität liegen kann oder an der Tatsache, dass du der ""Wunderdroge"" möglicherweise einiges zuschreibst, was mit dieser nichts zu tun hat. 

Die Schlussfolgerungen, die du daraus ziehst halte ich für sehr zweifelhaft. ""Unendliche Spirale der Selbstzerstörung"", ""Sucht und Depression"" - mit Verlaub, jetzt mach mal halblang! 
Es mag ja sein, dass du schlechte Erfahrungen mit Ritalin gemacht hast und es nicht das richtige für dich ist (wie gesagt, es ist ein Medikament für eine relativ kleine, mental gehandicapte Patientengruppe), aber du kannst davon ausgehend nicht behaupten, dass das für jeden gilt.

Ich bin absolut deiner Meinung, wenn du kritisierst, dass Metylphenidat-Präparate an ""jedes zweite Kind"" und auch viele nicht-ADS Erwachsene ausgegeben wird. Das ist total scheiße, auch aus den Gründen, die du ausgeführt hast. Jedoch gibt es Menschen, die unter dem unaufhörlichen, unkontrollierbaren Chaos im Kopf wahnsinnig leiden - und das ist nicht mit Querdenkertum oder Kreativität zu verwechseln. Es ist ein ständiger, aufreibender Unruhezustand, der gegenüber außenstehenden nur schwer zu beschreiben ist und viele unangenehme Konsequenzen hat. Wenn du nicht zu dieser Gruppe Menschen gehörst, kannst du  dich wirklich  glücklich schätzen. 

Tausenden dieser Patienten, die tatsächlich Hilfe brauchen, kann durch Methylphenidat Linderung verschafft werden - und dabei geht es nicht hauptsächlich ums Mitmischen in der bitterbösen profitorientierten Leistungsgesellschaft, sondern um die Ermöglichung des Aufbaus eines einigermaßen strukturierten Lebens und die Verminderung der zwanghaften Gedankenmuster. Das ist ein großer Unterschied.

Aber wie gesagt: Die Verschreibung und Einnahme von Ritalin &amp; Co ist  ausschließlich für die Behandlung von ADS zu befürwoten - ""normale"" Menschen, die sich damit dopen sind in dieser Debatte das Hauptproblem. Weil es leider so viele von ihnen gibt (und Ärzte die es verschreiben) geraten die eigentlichen Betroffenen in Verdacht, sich durch Drogen einen Vorteil verschaffen zu wollen - das Krankheitsbild wird missverstanden und marginalisiert. 

Ich bin für umfassendere Tests von mehreren Spezialisten vor der Verschreibung und bessere öffentliche Aufklärung über das eigentliche Handicap. Offensichtlich besteht hier viel Nachholbedarf.

I've been peering at the handwriting in the margin, and researching this like crazy, and can shed a little light on it for you - Herr Krieger listed the sunken *SS Barrsiter* as 3,679 tons. This is what his *Lloyds Shipping Register* would have given him when he checked the name of his victim with the survivors in the lifeboat. But that 3,679 ton ship was the **earlier** *Barrister* which was sunk the year before in 1917. The shipping company quickly replaced that one with a ship called the *Saint Hugo*, renaming her *Barrister*. This new one sunk on that night September 19 1918, was 4,952 tons, and it appears that Krieger (or someone) had noted that in the margin in handwriting afterwards when they found out the facts.

You can piss off with that line

&gt;First, it's impossible to get an exact pint anyway. You can't fill a glass all the way up, and you'll always have some foam.

A certain percentage of error is to be expected, and accounted for. What you've said applies to 500ml drinks just as much.

&gt;Second, in a blind test you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Sit down, take your time, tell me afterwards if you could tell a few ml apart.

Irrelevent. If I ask for a pint, I expect a pint. Again, a percentage of error is expected.

&gt;Third, you consume beer, not glasses. Measuring in pints does not improve your experience or the taste of your drink.

Neither does having it in a 500ml glass. You seem to all think that that's somehow 'better', when I haven't seen a single decent argument for it.

&gt;Just name the 568ml glass as ""the pint glass"", and that's all

That's what I was saying! Christ on a bike, some people!

Also, 5ooml **is not a pint**. This is nothing to do with national pride or tradition (although that might come into my liking of the word - centimetres are too cold and clinical for stuff like pub drinks) it's basic maths. A pint is 568ml, and if I ask for a pint that's the amount I expect (accounting for a certain degree of error, of course). Comprende?

&gt;But milk and everything else should be sold in metric quantities, it's ridiculous to keep imperial units for these.

Because...?

&gt;National pride and tradition are important cultural aspects, but being rational is above all.

Yeah, you should try it sometime.

Die BahnCard gibt es als BahnCard 25 mit 25% Rabatt und als BahnCard 50 mit 50%. Dir würde für deine Zeit hier die [Probe BahnCard](http://www.bahn.de/p/view/bahncard/ueberblick/probebahncard.shtml) für 25€ reichen, aber falls du etwas mehr fährst rechnet sich auch eine [BahnCard 50](http://www.bahn.de/p/view/bahncard/ueberblick/bahncard50.shtml) mit Studentenermäßigung für 122€. Aber Vorsicht -- die BahnCard ist immer ein Abbo (subscription), also nicht vergessen rechtzeitig zu kündigen.

Die andere Möglichkeit ist früh zu buchen. Für längere Strecken spart das mehr als eine BahnCard, und das geht auch international. Der Nachteil ist aber die Zugbindung, also dass du das Ticket für eine bestimmte Fahrt an einem festen Tag buchen musst. Diese Tickets kann man bis zu drei Monate vor, und spätestens drei Tage vor der Abfahrt buchen, wobei es nur eine begrenzte Anzahl gibt und die Preise teurer werden je weniger Tickets übrig sind. Innerhalb Deutschlands gibt es normalerweise noch einige Tage vorher billige Tickets, aber Fahrten ins Ausland solltest du möglichst früh buchen. Such am besten mal auf [Bahn.de](http://www.bahn.de/) nach ein paar Verbindungen die unterschiedlich lange in der Zukunft sind, um ein Gespür dafür zu bekommen wie sich die Preise ändern.

Für kurze Strecken innerhalb eines Bundeslandes sind vielleicht auch die [Ländertickets](http://www.bahn.de/p/view/angebot/regio/laender_tickets.shtml) interessant. Der Nachteil hier ist dass die nur in Regionalzügen gelten, also den langsamen die überall halten, nicht etwa im ICE.

&gt;The Greek state, let me remind you, is quite close to a primary surplus. With judicious top-down reductions wages and pensions, plus the issue of tax-bonds, the Greek public sector could finance itself for the foreseeable future. All that is needed is that the ECB continues to provide liquidity to the Greek banks. Some say that it cannot do this because it won’t be able to accept Greek government bonds as collateral (since the Greek state will have defaulted). True but irrelevant: Greek banks have already posted whatever government bonds they owned with the ECB for collateral. That creek has dried. Nowadays they are posting domestic mortgages and other such paper titles (which are, by the way, no worse in quality to those posted by Italian and Spanish banks). All that it would take to allow Greece to stay in the eurozone, in a better state than it is today (and less austerity for that matter), is the continuation of the present ECB policy toward Greek banks. As for those who argue that the ECB will take an aggressive stance, think again: the ECB will not knowingly take steps which will destroy the eurozone.

That's pretty much what Syriza's European policy spokesman said:

*""If you owe 3000 euros to the bank and don't pay, they will kill you. If you owe 10 billion euros, they will do everything for you.""*

Faced with this ""bargaining strategy"", the other Eurozone governments have a choice (and yes, that's a choice) -- cut Greece off, *collectively* guarantee a substantial percentage of debt and all deposits in the remainder of the Eurozone ASAP because they have to, and hope for the best, or double down, give Greece even more leverage as servicing the debt they took on to cover Greece's deficit, the now unlimited bank recapitalizations and the TARGET2 imbalances pile up, and set a precedent that demonstrates that the Eurozone can be blackmailed and that it will have your back even if you elect parties that run on a platform of doing just that.  

So far, both parliaments and the electorate in the core haven't exactly be eager to provide more funds and accept more risk, and populist parties are already a problem in Finland and the Netherlands. In the periphery, the governments would have to explain to their population that unpopular reforms are still necessary while populist parties would point to the ""Greek model"" of whaddareyougonnadoaboutit. Even the ECB can't provide unlimited funds to all of them, especially not while markets react to anti-EU sentiment all over the continent spinning out of control and the rhetoric escalates further.

If they choose the former, they'll lose Greece and suffer economically, but they can plausibly explain that they had no other choice and still claim credit for having prevented a total collapse and integrating Europe if it works. If they choose the latter, they'll lose the core, the next elections, and it would be the end of almost 60 years of European integration in form of an even bigger clusterfuck.

The underlying issues of the Eurozone have been well understood from the start. We can't have implicit guarantees of members' finances without ways to enforce responsible budget policy, and we need an internal transfer mechanism. We failed to agree on this in the almost decade of preparation, we failed to agree on it in the decade since the introduction, we have failed to agree on it during the crisis so far, so what on earth makes you think we'll agree on it while we're at each other's throats after demonstrating that the implicit guarantees will hold and the transfers will come even after negotiated agreements have been ""torn up""? And if we don't fix those issues, how long do you think it would take until we'll find ourselves at the same spot we're in now?

I'd see things differently if I would have faith in Greek governance. But I don't.  
I'm all for European integration and for working towards a fiscal union, including internal transfers and all that. I've supported a federal Europe and a stronger European Parliament with a proper budget for as long as I can remember. But at that point, you'd have lost me, because I just cannot imagine that Greece would reform itself without external pressure, especially not if the electorate chooses to do it the Syriza way and ends up getting away with it.",0,1337240733,null,0,false,0,c4p29id,t3_tpqjw,t1_c4p29id,t1_c4p0ydn,null,1428942639,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,nestoras,GREE,Greece,"&gt; Greece and its people are terribly corrupt and awfully good at dodging taxes

Just a short comment from a Greek:

* Greeks are not 'terribly corrupt', especially the younger generations (&lt;40). Most people just make do in the system they have found themselves into. Up to now, the 'way things worked' was too entrenched for anybody to believe that change can happen. This is not true anymore. I can't overstate what a breakthrough the recent election results were. Imagine if you will, that both Democrats and Republicans got a cumulative result of less than 30% in the next USA elections, with a third party poised to form a government.  Always remember: people are the same everywhere and basically want the same things (peace, stability, food on their table, prosperity for them and their families) regardless of race. The difference between an American and a Greek is that the American is backed by a much-much stronger economy (thus hiding from the general populace the deleterious effects of the corruption that lies at the bottom of the political swamp).

* 'Avoiding taxes' does not mean the same to a Greek as to an American. An analogy is me saying 'Americans are terribly corrupt and awfully good at downloading illegal music and movies from the internet, thus stealing from the poor musicians!'. I've tried to explain the analogy in an older [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hrng5/greece_agrees_to_more_cuts_and_tax_rises_as_price/c1xvooa).",0,1337246479,null,0,false,0,c4p2q1m,t3_tqnsp,t1_c4p2q1m,t1_c4oywda,null,1428942857,-3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-3
true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Sure the ECB could loosen up its policy and go on a helicopter drop to inflate all of Europe, but then you have to take into account all the voters outside of Greece. 

I think most of Europe would honestly benefit from a slight loosening of both fiscal and monetary policy. Longer timetables for budgetary consolidation would have less impact on growth, lack of which is part of what makes the deficit holes as bad and problematic. So probably even the effect on the budget balance would be better. 

&gt;Greece should just leave the euro. ... But, if they want to stay in the Euro they have to do these reforms! ... There is no way besides military occupation to force these cuts.

Yes, but there is no legal way to force them out of the eurozone either, if they insist on staying. Well, you could try provoking a worsening bank run until ECB says enough and limits the liquidity, so they can either have a complete financial collapse or a new currency, but that's quite a retaliation for a possible default - one all that were participating in knew was risky.

I think they can simply default and stay in the eurozone if they prefer that to austerity - that was never banned in the treaties., if they don't wish the austerity package. But then, they shouldn't get any aid, EFSF loans should cover ECB's losses, and still eventually be expected of Greece,

Speaking for myself, I think the conditionality represents a good faith effort to restore creditworthiness to the country - the troika has nothing to gain by having us on emergency programmes forever. Ireland is an open economy with high levels of imports and exports - fiscal expansion/contraction has a smaller multiplier than they have in a more closed economy like France/Greece. It slows growth, but not to the point that it becomes self-defeating (i.e. debt does fall faster than output).

Also, what never gets discussed is that Ireland's slow return to growth has as much to do with *private* debt as public debt. Household spending isn't simply restricted because of higher taxes/lower benefits - a whole generation is paying back hundreds of thousands of euros of mortgage debt, with reduced wages and a house whose value has halved.

By expanding that persecution to works of fiction, the severity of the actual crime of abusing children is watered down by a witch-hunt against bad taste on completely subjective terrain.

Yup, and that's at the core of Greece's problems. I'm certainly not saying that corruption doesn't exist elsewhere, as Siemens has demonstrated. But if Greece wan't such a particularly fertile ground for corruption, the same problems would be visible in all the other countries Siemens does business in.  
As long as there's a high level of corruption (incl. nepotism, favoritism), you can't have an efficient, effective and competent bureaucracy. And without that, you can't have an efficient and competitive economy. There's just too much friction loss that ends up in somebody's pockets instead of on people's paychecks.

&gt; and focused all their efforts in breaking the pensioner and worker.

To me it seemed as if their (edit: the Greek political elite's) efforts were focussed on fighting each other instead of coming up with plans to fight corruption, build up a competitive economy and going through the budget line by line to find all the stuff (and staff) that is *actual* waste. Then when deadlines loomed, the only way to make the grade were the broad blunt cuts you've mentioned, even though that meant that they for once had to do something that was unpopular with their voters. (I'm not saying pensions etc. wouldn't have been cut and that people wouldn't have suffered, but possibly not to the same degree.)

And that's the problem with the austerity vs. Keynes question. Permitting a larger budget would mean that the real issues would never get addressed, because the political elites would just go back to doing what they always did. Things like infrastructure funds would face the same bureaucracy problem as the EU structural and cohesion funds, of which €12 out of €20 are still left from the current 2007-2013 budget, by which I mean that the bureaucracy doesn't seem capable of putting them to the best possible use.

Per farti un'idea del pensiero di Paolo sulle donne ti riporto alcune citazioni dai Vangeli:
&gt;**Le mogli siano sottomesse ai mariti come al Signore; il marito infatti è capo della moglie**, come anche Cristo è capo della Chiesa, lui che è il salvatore del suo corpo. E come la Chiesa sta sottomessa a Cristo, così anche **le mogli siano soggette ai loro mariti in tutto**. E voi mariti, amate le vostre mogli, come Cristo ha amato la Chiesa e ha dato sé stesso per lei […] Così anche i mariti hanno il dovere di amare le mogli come il proprio corpo, perché chi ama la propria moglie ama sé stesso.

&gt;Voglio che sappiate che di ogni uomo il capo è Cristo, e **capo della donna è l'uomo**, e capo di Cristo è Dio.

&gt;L'uomo invece non deve coprirsi il capo, perché è l'immagine e la gloria di Dio; ma la donna è la gloria dell'uomo, perché l'uomo non è dalla donna, ma la donna dall'uomo, anche perché **l'uomo non fu creato per la donna, ma la donna per l'uomo**.

&gt;Come in tutte le comunità dei fedeli, **le donne nelle assemblee tacciano perché non è loro permesso parlare; stiano invece sottomesse**, come dice anche la legge. **Se vogliono imparare qualche cosa, interroghino a casa i loro mariti**, perché è sconveniente per una donna parlare in assemblea.

&gt;**Le donne siano vestite con decoro, adorne con modestia e verecondia**.

&gt;**La donna impari in silenzio, con tutta sottomissione. Non concedo a nessuna donna di insegnare, né di dettare legge all'uomo**; piuttosto se ne stia in atteggiamento tranquillo. Perché prima è stato formato Adamo e poi Eva; e non fu Adamo ad essere ingannato, ma **fu la donna che, ingannata, si rese colpevole di trasgressione**. Essa potrà essere salvata partorendo figli, a condizione di perseverare nella fede, nella carità e nella santificazione, con modestia.

&gt;**Non permetto alla donna d'insegnare, né di usare (usurpare) autorità sull'uomo, ma ordino che stia in silenzio**. Infatti è stato formato per primo Adamo e poi Eva. E non fu Adamo ad essere sedotto ma fu la donna che, essendo stata sedotta, cadde in trasgressione.

Edit: so bene che San Paolo influenzò il pensiero cristiano ben prima della differenziazione delle moderne chiese cristiane e che più o meno tutte le chiese lo riconoscono come padre fondatore, ma ho la netta sensazione che abbia avuto più peso a Roma che altrove. Se non altro i Protestanti non prendono tanto sul serio la sua dottrina.

I'm afraid not.

First, there are many ""pints"".

Second, historically, the imperial pint was equal to 1/8th of an imperial gallon, which in turn was based on the volume of 10 pounds of distilled water, weighed in air with brass weights, with the barometer standing at 30 inches of mercury, at a temperature of 62 degrees Fahrenheit. The pound was set according to the platinum weight deposited in the Standards department of the Board of Trade.

A pint is not a God-given unit of measurement, specifically designed for consumption only by the living creatures setting foot on Britain, because somehow their stomachs differ from those found in the rest of the world. It's a human convention.

&gt; Does that extra 15cm REALLY matter? It doesn't improve the taste!

Metres don't have any specific qualities, like taste.

I wholeheartedly agree. Everybody here wants change (I don't mean more money, I mean *change*). The problem is not just with the political elites though. An entire generation has been raised with a dream, to 'become a civil servant' and get set for life (once in, civil servants can never be fired for some crazy reason). What will those people do, if the public sector is shrunk? It has been made well known that the next step is to fire 150,000 civil servants. On top of Greece's current unemployment rate, that's a nightmare! 

&gt; And the prospect of Syriza or, even worse, nobody in government doesn't exactly fill me with confidence that this is going to improve.

Syriza is not so bad. They have never governed before and they have been out of the 'corruption loop' all these years. At least they are (viewed as) honest people. Maybe a bit populist, but with clean pockets. The worst that can happen (which is still pretty bad) is that they screw up due to inexperience and vast underestimation of the problems lying ahead.

Spain was created in 1469 by the union of Castile and Aragon, and there are references to ""España"" as the word to refer to that union dating back to the XVI century.

Spain was not ""created"" when Franco passed away, no matter what you say.

The French occupation of Spain of early 18' something is just as clear a break in the Spanish continuum as the French occupation of Morocco.

So forget about 1469.

The modern Spanish state, consistent with the sense in which we are talking about contemporary Morocco, was created with the constitutional monarchy of Don Juan Carlos in 1970 something.

So the simple maths clearly shows, on your analysis, Morocco is older than Spain.

Sure, the white flag has represented French monarchy for a long time and it may be that in 1790, while Louis XVI was still alive and there was hope for a parliamentary monarchy to happen, many associated white with the crown. But is this meaning still valid after the king was decapitated and republic proclaimed? And what about during monarchie de juillet? And then when the republic came back for good in 1871? Is it reasonable to assume that the meaning in 1790 is still valid when so many different regimes succeeded?  

I can't tell if you're American or not but one cause of confusion could lie in the perception of your own national identity. In the US the constitution is in essence the same as it was at creation. And once the design of Old Glory stabilized the only reason for it to change would be when a new state would join the union. It's not comparable to France. We went through restauration of monarchy, imperialism and 5 different republican constitutions. The identity of our nation isn't a revered and immutable entity like it's perceived in the US. The identity of our nation is something that's been fought over and over, like a tug of war between different forces inside French society. The flag has known grand moments and was smeared with mud and blood too.

Of course penalizing can be used as tool for intimidation. But it's not intimidation in and of itself, because you also need threats to make it intimidation. When it comes to the fear you have for an officers holstered gun, then it can be threatening, but not because the officer intimidated you. 

Besides that you also posses methods of intimidation, by default every human has this ability to intimidate. Every person out there can potentially hurt you, but you won't say that everybody is commanding respect.

Respect is given as much as it is earned. On an individual basis it's mostly earned. But on authority it is given, like you respect the elderly, the police, the law, etc. Which is not by definition done through intimidation.

&gt; Syriza is not so bad. *[…]* Maybe a bit populist, but with clean pockets.

Well, the way it's perceived here is exactly the opposite. Pasok and ND are coming across as ""reformed"", or at least as if they understood the situation, because they're willing to work together and are even campaigning on what people *don't* want to hear. Neither Samaras nor Venizelos are any more popular in Brussels or Berlin as they are in Athens. They just seem like the best bet.  
Syriza, on the other hand, is seen as a return to old politics -- they make unrealistic promises and refuse to cooperate with political competitors. Similarly, that people vote for them isn't seen as a fresh start, but as rejection of change. 

I believe that if Tsipras ends up heading the government, European leaders will meet him and explain the terms. They might throw in some potential rewards to sweeten the deal just like they'd have give something to Samaras so he'd have an achievement to return home with, but they'd have even less political wiggle room because they'd come across as blackmailable.  
As long as they have hope he'll eventually give in, not too much additional cost piles up for Tsipras to use as leverage and markets as well as savers remain calm, they'll probably be happy to give markets and themselves more time to prepare, but eventually they'll have to cut their losses and write Greece off.",0,1337278465,null,0,false,0,c4p7j0i,t3_tqnsp,t1_c4p7j0i,t1_c4p4cu3,null,1428945187,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,dannybutton,null,null,"I've been living in Germany for almost a year now, and I can offer several reasons to be reassured, but it would certainly help to know why, where and how long you're going.

A few things:

1) Germany, like anything else, can be enjoyed alone. I speak German and enjoy meeting people, but I've also spent hours alone on trains, in museums, and wandering around cities with no friends and no feelings of loneliness. 

2) German cities are incredibly safe, and you should never worry about going out alone even at night. 

3) Germans are wonderful people, and for the traveler they generally have three advantages: a) they won't come up to talk to you randomly, but b) they will gladly help you if you ask politely (asking if someone speaks English first is polite, even more so if you ask in German) and c) Germans like traveling, and they'll know someone who has been wherever you're from, and they'll talk to you about it.

4) English is really prevalent in most western parts of Germany, and most younger people and all students speak English as well. That said, you could learn travel German in a few weeks, and Germans won't mind if your accent is bad if you put in some effort. Learning how to order food -- ""Ich hätte gern... (Eesh hettuh gairn...)"" -- or how to find something -- ""Wie komme ich zu... (Vee commuh eesh tzoo....) -- is not difficult and really appreciated here.

5) There are maps everywhere in Germany and an extensive public transportation system. You cannot get lost, and you can get anywhere you want to go. 

6) If you're a student, there are discounts on all the good things in life, i.e. theater, music, food, books, museums

It's one of the greatest countries in the world. I suffer from pretty bad anxiety too, but try not to put too much pressure on yourself. Try your best to stay confident and enjoy the country. Even if you're too afraid to talk to anyone, don't stay holed up in a hotel room. You can learn about how people live by watching, and watching isn't as creepy as it sounds. 

Good luck.

The logical part I alluded to is that in any financial transaction, one party gives and one party receives. Here, the government gives money directly to the private entities. Thus, higher spending means more money in the hands of the economy. 

The multiplier effect focuses on what happens with that money after it has been handed out. A business that earns a lot of money with the government doesn't just save it all, it reinvests, makes more purchases, spends the money it received.

Even if there were mountains of rare-earth minerals, diamonds and oceans of oil under such places, in a modern European context, all taxation would revert to the EU and the whole of the continent or are you all forgetting all the money being poured over the years for socio-infrastructural improvements?

The UK is the UK and will never stop being the UK if it fully adheres to the EU. Same as Spain.

As for the Falklands/Malvinas, it does look far away but so does the French Guiana and a whole lot of enclaves of various sorts. Let the people who actually live there decide. 

As for Olivença, in a proper European context... blah blah, repeating myself. It doesn't bother or even matters. Spain and Portugal already share rivers, damns, artificial lakes, air space, waters, policing. why not some ill-defined borders? It's not like they can divorce us and move out of the Peninsula.

Now, in a different context, outside of a full fiscal/monetary European Union, it should be dealt differently and perhaps more decisively. Without decades of bullshit and countless shifting referendums or oppression.

That's forbidden by the very Treaty of Utrecht: was the UK ever to renounce to Gibraltar, it will automatically become part of Spain.

Unless you are talking about breaking the Treaty of Utrecht but I'd say that's outside of the question.

Just for your interest, here is a [picture of UB-64](http://imgur.com/1utZB) which killed my Great-Grandfather. I can honestly say, that I hold no animosity whatsoever so Ernst Krieger and his crew. he was just doing his job and that was war. But especially, the fact is, if those circumstances and tiny twists of fate that made him head for Chicken Rock did ***not*** happen &amp; he never saw the *SS Barrister*, then **I** would not have come into existence on this earth.

What I do feel some sadness about, is my Grandfather growing up without a Papa. Every little boy needs his Daddy.

And [this tiny grainy thumbnail](http://imgur.com/TuJ7m) is the man in question - my Great Grandfather b. 1890 d. 1918; I can see some of myself in his features.

My entire family are grateful for your efforts, Internet Stranger.

IMPOSSIBRU!  
How would the gov have more money to spend if they lower taxes?

Plus, let me just add that ""European austerity"" is a myth:

&gt; National budgets are NOT decreasing their spending, they are increasing it:  
&gt; 
&gt; * Between 2000 and 2010, national budgets in the EU increased by 62 % while the EU budget increased by 37% over the same period.  
&gt; * In 2011, 23 national budgets out of 27 are currently increasing.  
&gt; * In 2012, 24 national budgets out of 27 are due to increase according to the latest estimations.

There are no obligations to citizenship. Passports are bought for a number of years at the Consulate and be sure to get it before you travel. I believe you must pay a fee each year to maintain one as well.

A bit of searching indicates that taxes will need to be paid to the US regardless of where you are or how much you earn. However, it seems if you establish residency you can be tax exempt under 70,000 USD.

&gt;TAXATION*: Although the United States taxes its citizens even when they live abroad, you can qualify for tax exclusion for all income earned in Italy or elsewhere in the European Union up to $70,000 USD per year. In order to qualify you must establish a tax home outside the U.S. and pass one of two tests:

Physical-presence test: you need to be at least 330 days outside of the U.S. over a consecutive 12-month period.
Foreign-residence test: you become a bona fide resident of Italy or of any other EU country for an entire taxable year. If you live in Italy or in Europe and have an Italian passport, you should pass this test.
Remember that even if you don’t qualify for this exclusion, Italy and the United States have tax treaties to protect their citizens from dual taxation. Generally, you don't pay U.S. tax on foreign-earned income if the foreign tax rate is higher than the U.S. rate. If the foreign rate is lower, you will have to pay US taxes on the difference between these rates. 
*Always check with your tax and/or immigration attorneys for more information.
