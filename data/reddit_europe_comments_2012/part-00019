They offer really interesting products (rarely with their brand written anywhere on the clothes). So that might fit you.

As for a place to eat... last nice place I've been to: [Schwartz's](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=4622184493425908063&amp;q=schwartz%27s+paris&amp;hl=en&amp;authuser=0&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=src:ppiwlink&amp;ei=dy1BT6eGCfChiAeRx-XjBA&amp;dtab=2)
It's an american restaurant, with huge burgers to offer! Really nice place to be in, and great atmosphere. But it's an american restaurant, if you want a more french experience, you can just walk around, and find any restaurant

[Aux Petits Chandeliers](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=restaurant+reunionais+paris&amp;hl=en&amp;cid=700149392169902755) is maybe more suitable for a family meal...

One last chance is to check, if theres a paragraph in the contract that says you have the right to cancel it after 1month or something like that.

Klar, die, die von ACTA am meisten profitieren würden... wollen ACTA natürlich auch. Überrascht das irgendjemanden?

&gt; Sie sprechen von ""einer Generation, in der viele ohne jedes Unrechtsbewusstsein für 'digitalen Diebstahl' aus Schule und Elternhaus in die große Welt des Internets entlassen worden""

Ich behaupte frecherweise mal, dass das stehlen von physischen objekten schlimmer ist, als das ""stehlen"" (oder sollte ich eher, ""ausleihen"" sagen - schliesslich behauptet keiner der leute, welche zb. MP3's herunterladen, dass sie diese musik komponiert haben) von internet resourcen. 

&gt; Nachdem sich jeder davon überzeugen konnte, dass alle bei Acta zur Eindämmung von Rechtsverletzungen vorgesehenen Maßnahmen bereits dem deutschen Schutzniveau entsprechen, sollte das Abkommen nun auch unterzeichnet werden. Wir bedauern, dass die Bundesjustizministerin die internationale Durchsetzung des europäischen Schutzniveaus infrage stellt

Es ist auch verdammt gut dass das BJM das ganze in frage stellt: Immerhin besteht ja der verdacht, dass ACTA eigentlich verfassungsfeindlich ist, da es ja ganz unverblümt die rechte der freien leute in deutschland angreift!

&gt; Die Warnhinweis-Modelle werden von den Acta-Gegnern strikt abgelehnt, mit dem Argument, sie kämen einer Privatisierung der Rechtsprechung gleich

Und das ist auch so ziemlich das haupt argument: Mit ACTA könnte jeder konzern vollkommen unabhängig verklagen wie's ihm grad in den hut passt; auch wenns keine beweise gibt. Oder vielleicht eher, ***ganz besonders*** wenns keine beweise, sondern nur vermutungen gibt.

&gt; Just as the combined might of the IMF and the Greek government is pulling economic levers that do not work, the more insidious problem is that they are pulling political strings that are broken.

I see. The British isles were uninhabited. The Saxons came in and saw empty land.

&gt; And it wasn't a democracy.

[Neither was Latvia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kārlis_Ulmanis#Authoritarian_r.C3.A9gime) at the time when it was conquered by the Soviet Union. Not that it matters really, in both cases people died. Just because your ancestors murdered people that didn't have democratic representation doesn't make them any less guilty than the Soviets in 1939.

&gt; Well, the Scots signed an Act of Union, actually.

By that time the Scots already had an English head of state and spoke in English language. But hey, let's ignore the 500 years or murder, rape and pillage that preceeded that Act, it's your history, right, I'm just an ignorant foreigner. And let's not forget the Irish also signed an Act of Union, eh? And the Indian maharajas also signed contracts inviting your soldiers to occupy them... out of love maybe? You know, if we look at the legal documents, the Soviet Union also didn't ""invade"" the Baltic states, in fact it was invited by the Baltic states themselves! The Soviets were just following the model you guys perfected in the previous centuries.

&gt; successive invasions of a geographical area 

The ""geographical area"" being Scotland and Ireland, with people living there, people that were murdered by these successive invasions.

&gt; before there was any cohesive nation

Before the Act of Union the English didn't exist, I understand now!

&gt; and before there was any democracy

Just like how there wasn't any democracy in Latvia in 1939.

&gt; is just not the same as a totalitarian state signing an agreement with fascists to ride roughshod over a democratic state.

In either case people died. The government of the invading nation doesn't make the crimes any less severe.

There's no reason not to invoke a certain leader who used a certain ethnic group as the sole reason a certain country was going down the drain, and look at what he accomplished.

Quant au reste, N_Sharma l'a très bien dit, il n'y a rien à sauver. Il avait promis de mettre fin à la Françafrique et de bâtir un nouveau modèle, il n'a réussi qu'à faire perdre le maigre avantage que nous possédions là bas, qu'à jeter les états africains dans les bras des chinois, à ternir les relations déjà précaires, pour au final ressusciter les vieilles combines et à chercher l'approbation de despotes africains. 

Ahaha très drôle le côté Sarkozy sauveur de la France, mais, non. Il n'a sauvé que les intérêts des invités du Fouquet's cette brasserie populaire.

La manie du gouvernement à chercher à nous intoxiquer en citant le modèle allemand de façon partielle : le bouclier fiscal vendu sous prétexte que l'Allemagne fait de même (mars 2009), alors que la loi allemande ne prévoit pas de tel dispositif. Et tout est à l'avenant en matière économique et budgétaire. Depuis les clips de l'UMP en 2009 nous vendant la fin de la crise (impayable Madame Vautrin), jusqu'au discours sur la moralisation de la finance en passant par l'absence de garantie d'emprunt pour les PME. Madame Lagarde au parlement en Novembre 2007 annonçant fièrement qu'une famille pourrait transmettre 2Millions d'Euros de patrimoine sans payer d'impôt, sur l'air du ""nous travaillons pour les familles moyenne"", voilà aussi une raison de n'accorder aucun crédit à ce personnage. Dommage de mettre au chômage de si bons humoristes me direz vous.

Son appui inconditionnel (ou aveugle on ne sait pas trop) à la nouvelle Ostpolitik de l'Allemagne, voilà encore un problème. Doublée des erreurs diplomatiques envers la Turquie. 
La France, que l'on serait en droit de vouloir la nation irréprochable des droits de l'Homme et du citoyen se voit condamner (une nouvelle fois) par la CEDH pour avoir interner des enfants de 4 mois dans les centres de rétention, la circulaire Guéant sur la chasse aux Roms, le fichier des ""gens honnêtes"", les mensonges sur les fraudes à la sécurité sociale,... 

Non, pour moi ce sera sans doute celui qui parlera le mieux de fiscalité. Ca ne fait pas rêver parce que c'est accepter la répartition ""primaire"" des revenus. Mais c'est essayer de construire une société plus juste. Une société dans laquelle on ne met pas le prêtre au dessus de l'école gratuite et obligatoire de la République.

Pour ce qui est des traités européens et de leur éventuelle re négociation dans le cadre d'un nouveau gouvernement, pas sûr que le président actuel les comprenne bien ces traités. Il y a deux jours il parlait de l'entente cordiale en nous déclarant vouloir le faire évoluer vers une entente amicale. Ce traité signé en 1904 a amené des millions de britanniques a venir défendre la terre de France. Et il n'a la juge pas amicale cette entente ? 400000 morts anglais dans la Somme !

Pour ma part, je ne serais pas contre la renégociation de certains traités. Pourquoi ne pas associer plus pleinement les parlements nationaux et le parlement européen ? Pourquoi ne pas repenser la BCE ?

Ich finde, dass ein solcher nur einen Versuch darstellen würde, im Nachhinein die Fehler zu verharmlosen, die all die Jahre über während der dilletantischen Polizeiarbeit gemacht wurden. Damit sollte durch heuchlerischen ""Respekt-Erweisens"" der Polizei der Kopf aus der Schlinge gezogen werden. Ich kann mir auch nicht vorstellen, dass man als Opferfamilie Jahre nach dem gewaltsamen Tod seines Angehörigen auf einmal so ein Brimborium begrüßen wurde - nachdem eben jahrelang - entschuldigt die Ausdrucksweise - n Scheiß auf eine ordentliche Ermittlungsarbeit gegeben wurde und nur ein Bruchteil der Aufmerksamkeit, die durch einen Staatsakt künstlich erzeugt wird, vermutlich zu einer viel früheren Ergreifung der Täter geführt hätte.

Ich persönlich sehe auch nichts Verwerfliches in seinen Äußerungen zu Hartz-IV, wobei ich die Polemik gegen Hartz-IV in deinen Quellen generell als übertrieben ansehe. Auch wenn die Agenda 2010 vermutlich nicht der Befreiungsschlag der Arbeiterklasse war und sicherlich nicht das sozialste Programm der Bundesgeschichte, ist es sichelrich kein Ausschlusskriterium für einen Bundespräsidenten für dieses Gesetz eingestanden zu haben, vor allem bei einem Thema, das in der gesamten Bundesrepublik die Gemüter spaltet und es genug Für und Wider dazu gibt.

Im Gegenteil begrüße ich es, dass Gauck als Parteiloser offen seine Meinung zu einem solchen umstrittenen Thema äußert ohne jegliches Parteien- oder Wählerkalkül. Genau das erwarte ich von einem Bundespräsidenten. Ich kann nicht erwarten, dass er immer meiner Meinung ist. 

Die Sarrazin-Geschichte ist natürlich nicht gut. Wobei man hierbei auch aufpassen muss: Er hat explizit NICHT Sarrazins Thesen gelobt - was vor allem beim allerersten Link zu Radio-Utopie abartig verfälschend dargestellt wird - sondern einen vermeintlichen Mut ein problembehaftetes Thema anzusprechen. Ich wage nicht zu behaupten, dass ich Gaucks Meinung zu Sarrazins Thesen kenne, aber man muss da schon differenzieren. Er lobt nicht das verblödete Geschwafel Sarrazins, sondern dass er Themen auf den Tisch bringt, an die sich vllt nicht jeder traut. Auch das erwarte ich im Übrigen von einem Bundespräsidenten. Zudem muss man diese Äußerungen auch hinblicklich des Zeitpunkts betrachten. Das war noch mitten in der Zeit, in dem Sarrazin von vielen Politikern hochgejubelt wurde, bevor das ganze ins zu Recht ins Gegenteil umschlug. Ich denke, dass zu dieser Zeit noch ganz andere Lobesreden auf Sarrazin gehalten - von jetzt auch noch aktiven Politikern. 

Falls er sich wider meiner Erwartung explizit auf Seiten Sarrazins geschlagen haben sollte, wäre das für mich ein Ausschlusskriterium, da er dann nicht in seiner auch integrativen Funktion ernst genommen werden kann.

Je n'ai absolument aucun espoir qu'un mouvement à la gauche du PS puisse gagner. J'ose simplement espérer qu'un score honnête du front de gauche puisse rappeler à Hollande (lequel a toutes ses chances avec la polarisation d'une bonne frange de l'électorat contre Monsieur Sarközy de Nagy-Bocsa) qu'il reste des sympathisants aux idéaux de la gauche et qu'il devra composer avec. 

Et certaines des idées de son programme me plaisent. La constitution V^eme république a été taillée pour De Gaulle par lui et ses proches, et on gagnerait aujourd'hui (selon moi) à moins de concentration des pouvoirs, le parlement et la justice n'ayant que trop rarement voix au chapitre.

Sur l'Europe, je me souviens, j'étais petit, on me parlait de fraternité entre les peuples, de libertés et de prospérité mutuelle. Je cligne des yeux, et le sud du continent gagne des dirigeants qui ne sont pas élus démocratiquement, pendant que la BCE dicte, et que l'Allemagne (il faut bien quelqu'un à accuser) profite de l'euro pour avoir mener une politique exportatrice, les désagréments en moins. Il me semble nécessaire, sans détruire le processus européen de renégocier certains traités, pour plus de représentativité, et que l'Union puisse se doter d'outils économiques adaptés. Je suis fleur bleue, mais vu la position de la France dans l'Europe, ceux qui tiennent à une survie de l'UE n'auront guère le choix si ils ne veulent pas voir le bousin éclater.

Je n'adhère absolument pas à la politique de lutte contre l'immigration actuelle : Les chiffres ne sont pas si impressionnants que ça, et comptabilisent les français retournant résider sur le territoire français. Et je reste convaincu que les immigrants arrondissent les caisses (faudra que je remette la main sur les études qui allaient en ce sens) de l'état, et occupent des postes non qualifiés que les français rechignent à prendre (À titre d'exemple, tous les équipages de chalutiers dans le coin sont composés de jeunes d'origine polonaise, les patrons de pêche ne trouvent pas un éphèbe d'origine hexagonale). Et on a des gens brillants qui viennent étudier dans le pays, et qui apporteront un plus à la recherche française, ou feront un peu rayonner notre culture à l'étranger, donc ne venez pas secouer la circulaire de M. Guéant sous mon nez.

Je ne me sens pas proche des verts : ils ont certainement raison, on a grandement besoin de développement durable. Mais ça passe par une sortie du consumérisme plutôt que de s'amuser à mettre des poubelles vertes partout et de relancer les centrales au charbon après avoir décidé d'arrêter les atomes.

Sur la politique financière, je ne suis ni frontiste (l’effondrement de l'économie après des décisions dadaïstes , c'est bien, mais seulement dans les JdR post-apo), ni frontdegauchiste (le salaire maximum oui, quelques renationalisations, pourquoi pas, le SMIC à 1700€, faut aimer l'inflation à deux chiffres), ni sarkozyste ( l'augmentation massive de la dette et une stagnation de l'économie, ce n'est pas une solution pérenne). Reste le programme PS, qui brille par son côté particulièrement flou et qui pourra être réinterprété à sa guise par M. Hollande.

J'attends aussi, après le quinquennat actuel, où on a eu le droit à une réduction des libertés, de l'indépendance de la justice, à une contraction de l'éducation, de la recherche, de la santé, à des problèmes mal traités dans l'armée, à une rupture consommée entre les forces de l'ordre et la population, à une diminution du rôle de la France sur la scène internationale, à des privatisations qui appauvrissent tant l’État que la compétitivité, à de grosses collusions privé/publique et à une stagnation des acquis sociétaux, *(ajoutez ce que j'ai oublié ici)*

It's just that the centre ground in America is socially conservative and economically liberal, so the main thing which distinguishes them in America is their social liberalism. Whereas in Europe, where social liberalism is the consensus, the economic side stands out. And, of course, it would be madness to define European politics relative to the American centre ground. Are you: liberal, liberal, liberal, or liberal?

Also, to be a bit more snarky, this is a European subreddit. You wouldn't object to using the phrase Social Democrat, even though it doesn't have much meaning in the States. And to set snark to absolute maximum, American political terminology seems to me to be somewhat compromised; as far as I can see, in America socialist means subversive, communist means traitor and liberal means pussy. We just don't have that sort of linguistic warfare, at least in Britain, where people are more happy to call a spade a spade.

One of the reasons for the failure of European heads of state and of government to resolve the Eurozone crisis is German resistance to debt buy-outs, national guarantees and fiscal transfers between member states.

This paper argues that none of these are necessary for Europe (1) **to stabilise the crisis by converting a share of national debt to EU bonds**, and (2) for net issues of Eurobonds to finance recovery.

In so doing it draws on the precedent of the US New Deal, as did an earlier report recommending bond finance to Jacques Delors which he then endorsed as Union Bonds in his White Paper of December 1993.
It suggests that if the New Deal precedent were to be stressed by Timothy Geithner it could carry major resonance and encourage conviction that Europe can resolve the Eurozone crisis.

There should be a distinction between Union Bonds which are not traded and net issues of Eurobonds which would be traded and attract global surpluses to finance a New Deal style social investment led recovery.

true,Kim147,UKGB,United Kingdom Thanks,"On a completely separate but very pertinent issue . There is a growing massive problem in the EU of lack of labour market flexibility . Within an economy such as the UK's there are basically 3 types of 'staff. :-

i) employed staff . These have full benefits including unemployed benefits . They are taxed at full personal rates . Their employers smooth out the income .

ii) contract staff . These are people operating as single owner operator companies - contracted out services . They very much have a deal with the state where they can't claim unemployment benefits but have much greater responsibility and control over their personal income . They are taxed at business rates thus offsetting the greater risk . They do not have any paid annual leave or sick leave . Their income is not guaranteed and they need to earn a good amount upfront in order to tide themselves over periods when they aren't earning . They are small business people .

iii) temp staff - they operate similarly to contract staff . They are casual labour and do not have rights to annual leave and sick pay etc. . They are paid an increased amount but are often taxed similar to an employee.

The EU has the 183 day rule where it treats contractors as employees if they work more than 183 days for a client . At this point they end up paying around 42% in taxes and charges . Rates prior to the crash were sufficient to offset this but this whole situation did increase costs greatly to Continental clients . After the crash the clients started screwing down the rates . The payment of local taxes also upsets the contractor's home country tax arrangements . The contractors end up getting screwed from all sides .

When an economy downsizes it needs flexibility in it's workforce to handle the decreased workload . During the downturn companies can't afford to keep all their permanent staff . Contractors and temps are useful .

When an economy grows it needs labour flexibility - it needs to take on contractors and temps to fill the gaps .

We are now in the situation where the economy is picking up , particularly in the UK , but UK contractors are often refusing to work on the Continent - it is just not worth it - too many hassles , too much cost . What this means is that the EU powers that be and particularly many of the member states themselves are shooting themselves in the foot economically . The UK has the flexibility to take on all the work that the Continent is missing out on . And the UK is being more price competitive .

And comparing the language that was not necessary to live in that country for a lot longer than the 20 odd years it gained independence and math is just completely wrong.

Russian speaking population, call them whatever you want, was fighting for the independence in the same way as the Latvians themselves. Latvians got the citizenship's and their language became the official one, while still being under the soviet rule, everyone was promised equal rights and citizenship (alongside loads of money and all the other crap). My mother who lived all her life in this country was participating in all the protests. She never spoke Latvian because she wasn't born there, but started doing so because she believed. What did she get in response? An Aliens passport. She basically has no citizenship in any country.Oh she can just leave to Russia with that passport? She has no ties to Russia whatsoever, she doesn't even know a single person there.

The government is not encouraging them to learn the language, it's trying to force them. They're forcing patriotism by giving big fines for those who don't have Latvian flags on their houses when there is a national celebration of some sort. Forcing Russian schools to write exams in Latvian, after learning this language as a second one for a few odd years isn't the way either.

- ...qui s'accompagnent d'une démolition en règle de l'Education Nationale et de la formation des enseignants. En bref on fait mine de s'attaquer aux effets de la délinquance, et on en aggrave les causes. Un cocktail explosif.

- une politique inhumaine de traque aux immigrés, avec des situations kafkaïennes. Je fais pas le topo sur ""les heures les plus sombres de notre histoire"", mais quand on s'entoure de gens comme Longuet, Guéant ou Hortefeux, le message est clair.

- l'incarnation parfaite de la politique libérale responsable de la crise, qui renfloue les copains banquiers sur le dos du reste de la société, et étrangle la Grèce à coups de rigueur.

You just need that to subscribe a seasons pass or for away matches and sometimes to buy single tickets with a little discount, you won't need that. 

The Monte Mario sector basically has better seatings and services and more tickets available since less season pass were sold for that, police pat downs at gates will be very light or absent at all. The view is the same of Tribuna Tevere. In the central part of Monte Mario there's the VIP sector and the journalist area.  

Tevere has simpler seatings and the central area seatings will be sold out to season pass holders. The atmosphere is more popular, people chants and supports more. Imho stick for one of the Tribunas (Tevere or Monte Mario) if you care for the view. 

The view from Curvas is worse even if the atmosphere is better. In Curva Sud people will watch the match standing, despite having seats, as does the lower part of Curva Nord. Most of time they'll be singing and waving flags so sometimes your view can be blocked by a huge flag, and police pat downs can be more strict at gates, generating queues sometiems if you don't arrive early.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;He strongly applauded a very racist book

Your comment is a manipulative twist of what he actually said. I assume you talk about Sarrazin's book? Gauck's full quote said that Sarrazin is bold for saying some things that nobody else says, and a coward for saying exactly those things that everybody wants to hear. (I'm paraphrasing. If there's interest, I can find the original quote.) It's needlessly cryptic, and I don't like it much either, but it's a far cry from ""OMG Gauck is a racist"". (clarification: Sarrazin is, I believe a racist. Gauck is not, from what I can tell so far). And about the OWS movement: yes, he said a short dismissive line about it. Guess what, so would most politicians of the established German parties. They just would phrase it more carefully.

true,Deusdies,EART,Earth,"Well, for starters, it was not unusual for the cops to beat people up because they were speaking ""against the regime"". Many of them had often power drives. To make matters worse, during Yugoslavia you were not really allowed to talk about that publicly, so one would never hear about police brutality on the TV (except later in the late 1990s, when the opposition TVs started airing). I remember being a kid and being afraid of police - if one walks pass you, you'd just look down and try to avoid him.

Today, the police is pretty chill. We all have jokes, when they pull you over it's instantly turned into a joke (if you're not an asshole at least). You rarely hear of police brutality nowadays unless you're really a scumbag. They leave ordinary people alone - you barely even see cops on the streets today, as a matter of fact :) I saw two yesterday in my city of 200k people and thought ""whoa, these guys are still alive!""

Lots has changed since 2000, and especially after 2003 when the police action ""[Sablja](http://www.arhiva.srbija.gov.rs/vesti/2003-04/29/335683.html)"" (saber / sword) took place (after the assassination of the then-prime minister). Over 11 000 people were arrested (though most obviously have been let go immediately), dozens of murders and attempt murders were solved, several kidnapping attempts, 208 drug labs were busted, 75 kilos of drugs were burned, etc... all the good stuff. The point I was trying to make is that many police officers were arrested then as well. 

All this being said, one should never mess with the ""Interventna Brigada"" (literaly translated it's ""Intervening Brigade"") - they're the guys that take over when the ordinary traffic police (which we have the most) has issues putting someone in jail. However you rarely see them in public - I've only seen them a few times (4-5 at most) in the public in real life, once when there was a bank robbery for example. They also are in charge with maintaining order when there are protests, riots, etc. They make arrests (based on arrest warrant). 

Then there is Žandarmerija (Gendarmerie). They're the police unit for somewhat high-risk situations. They maintain order during football games for example, make high-warrant arrests, etc. [This is what they look like](http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/7561/genser2zd5.jpg). I've only seen them once in real life, during a football match. 

Then there is SAJ (Specijalne Antiterorističke Jedinice / Special Anti-Terrorist Units) and PTJ (Protiv Terorističke Jedinice / Anti-Terrorist Units). They are called when shit really hits the fan. Hostage situations, really high-warrant arrests (they arrested Ratko Mladić for example), terrorist situations (obv). They're rarely deployed (at least what is known to the general public). SAJ looks like [this](http://i25.tinypic.com/2q3yq9w.jpg). PTJ looks like [this](http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=97793&amp;d=1244405067). Honestly I'm not sure what the difference between the two is. 

Oh, for comparison, traffic police looks like [this](http://www.kurir-info.rs/static/imgs/article_thumbs/632x474/uploads/2010-11/28795.jpg). 

[Here's a short film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfjI7kwCNs0) about SAJ arresting a man who in an unprecedented case murdered 9 people. 

Overall, nowadays the public is pretty supportive of police. They're doing their job well enough and they don't really mess with ordinary citizens.

You know they're there, and it's not like they're easily overlooked when they're ahead of you. It becomes a safety hazard when they pull out of the right lane unexpectedly, and that you have to be prepared to deal with situations like this at the speed your going is why I don't like to see the autobahn promoted as something like a fun tourist attraction.

&gt; and why does a truck going faster damage the road more?

Speed is a minor factor compared to weight, but especially if the road already has damages, it still matters. The damage done by normal cars is negligible compared to that caused by trucks.

I didn't find myself living a poor life at 4500 euros, I would say middle class, however a middle class american will live much better than a middle class french why?

Link 1 is one big opinionated article. I can't even follow the mainline argument, it's so poorly structured. The *factual* part is this: he is a member of a society that holds/held services for victims of the National Socialist justice system. In once case dead people were included that were Nazis themselves. Probably a bad choice, but then again, there's zero information in this article if Gauck knew anything about this, if he was involved in organizing the event, what the ratio of **real** victims to not-really-victims was (which matters a lot, because if there were only 2 bad cases but 100 actual victims were honored, then it looks more like an honest mistake rather than something done on purpose). But seriously, if he did anything wrong in this context, please find a better article than this: it doesn't say anything that can be taken as him ""honouring Nazis"", only that he attended a highly respected event that honours **victims of the Nazi regime** but which in one instance included 2 men that were not only victims but pepetrators as well.

Link 2 is about the [Prague Declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Declaration_on_European_Conscience_and_Communism). Václav Havel signed it as well, by the way. Basically, it is similar in sentiment to the [Black Book of Communism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism), another document that was wildly misrepresented by various factions of the political spectrum. That declaration essentially points out the immense crimes commited in the name of state communism. Those crimes against humanity are facts, right? We're not suddenly saying that Stalin was a good guy. What is problematic about the declaration, no doubt, is that many ultra-right and neo-Nazi groups like to jump on the bandwaggon and take the fact that communism was a criminal regime as evidence that the Nazi regime wasn't all that bad. Which is of course bullshit. But that is not of primary concern for the victims of communism, such as Gauck and Havel: they have every right to point out how much suffering communism has brought upon them or their countries. And they can do that as long as they don't claim that Nazi terror and communism are one and the same, and that Nazism wasn't all that bad. Now, if you find a quote by Gauck that says that Nazi terror = Communism terror, I will change my mind about him, but until then, you (and the article) have no point I can respect.

I avoided the other Americans in my program and didn't speak a word of English to any of my hallmates (except for the occasional times when I helped them correct their English papers).

However, if the truck driver loses control due e.g. road damage, tire damage, wind on a bridge, trying to avoid sth. etc. it is easier to regain control of a big heavy truck at a speed of 80kph than 130kph. Also the faster truck would more likely be able to break the middle barrier.

Also, truck drivers drive like 10 hours. If they fall victim for microsleep 130kph is so much more dangerous than 80kph in my opinion.

And because Greece can't devalue their currency to increase the competitiveness of their exports, this is not going to help them resume economic growth.

Greece will enter a death spiral of economic decline. Which will in turn increase the interest rates for the European ""bailout"" loans, making the situation even worse. Interest rates for Greece have already soared over 800%.

Yeah, that swerving shouldn't be happening. Slow cars/trucks drive in the right lane, you drive as fast as your lane allows you to. If you have to swerve around, you might be doing something wrong in my opinion.

&gt; You say that its the truck driver's job to be aware of faster traffic and they're professionals, well its also their job not to microsleep and to stay alert.

But I think it's safe to assume that a truck driver does not mircrosleep when starting to overtake...

&gt; I would be curious, are more accidents on the autobahn are caused by truck drivers or by cars? I'd be willing to bet its the cars that cause them.

Quite possible. But I do think the speed limit does a good part for that. (Disclaimer: Don't have any statistics. I looked something up on destatis.de but it isn't possible to filter... I mean, sure the raw numbers show more cars involved in accidents, but that's simply because there are far more cars. Also, most of the car accidents happen in city traffic, filtering by Autobahn was not possible... [But this (German) article](http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/0,1518,242212,00.html) suggests (without sources) that 25% of truck accidents are trucks rear-ending others.)

Still I thing, losing control of a truck can cause more damage than a car rear-ending a slower truck, and thus should be prevented.

&gt; but have you driven between the major cities? There are long stretches of few cars where I see no problem having a modern truck driving at higher speeds.

I regularly drive between Karlsruhe and Bremen (A5, A45 &amp; A1 or A7, depending on weather and traffic). Guess that's not very representative, but they are pretty packed at daytime (except on weekends, when trucks are not allowed). Also quite curvy and wavy especially between cities.

One more thing: With a high amount of trucks it would be hard to merge from accelleration lane to the right lane in a not so fast accellerating car. Trucks would have to make room for merging slower cars by switching lanes or slowing down, and I think that's more hazarding than the slow-trucks-on-the-right-lane thing.

I do see one problem: Fast car, switching to right lane because pressured by faster car, rear ending a slow truck. But that is a general problem, one could be pressured into going in front of a fast truck. And I do think, a truck having to go around a slower car is more dangerous.

Nein, war es nicht. Und genau deswegen ist der Vergleich mit der demokratischen Occupy-Bewegung eine absurde Verdrehung der Tatsachen. Das weiß Gauck natürlich, aber den eher schlichten Gemütern fällt das nicht auf. Auch das weiß Gauck.

&gt;Moralische Kompetenz - was auch immer das sein soll - hat sich Gauck nicht durch seine bloße Anwesenheit in der DDR erschlichen.

true,Cokeser,null,null,"Nein, sie spricht ihm ""moralische Kompetenz"" zu. Ich sehe darin zwei mögliche Deutungen: Die SZ meint eine Kompetenz in moralischen Fragen, die er meiner Meinung nach durch sein größtenteils durchdachtes und unverwerfliches Auftreten durchaus hat; oder die SZ meint tatsächlich eine Kompetenz auf dem Bankensektor, die allerdings nur moralischer Natur, also nicht einer durch Bildung erlangten, Wirtschaftskompetenz entspricht um damit mMn vielmehr um Verständnis seiner wenig kapitalimuskritischen Ansichten zu werben. Sie stellt ihn damit keineswegs als neuen Wirtschaftsweisen vor, sondern erklärt seine Sichtweise, die für mich zumindest nachvollziehbar ist - unabhängig davon wie man zur Occupy-Bewegung steht. 

Damit zum zweiten Punkt: Bei seiner Kritik zur Occupy-Bewegung wird einfach wieder sehr viel hochstilisiert. Er äußerte sich kritisch dazu, dass die Loslösung vom Bankensystem und Kapitalismus so einfach sei, wie sich das so mancher bei Occupy vorstellt. Damit hat er doch recht, oder etwa nicht? Seinen Vergleich mit der DDR brachte er, so wie ich das verstanden habe, als Mahnmal für eine von Politikern bestimmte Geldwirtschaft als Gegensatz zum privaten Bankensystem. Und DA ist schon ein Vergleich sinnvoll. Inwiefern das das Primärziel der Occupy-Bewegung ist, sei dahingestellt, aber der Vergleich, den Gauck anstellt, ist durchaus berechtigt - wenn man ihn sich nicht nur zusammengekürzt und aus dem Kontext gerissen ansieht. Im Übrigen hatte er sogar Recht: Die Bewegung ist in Deutschland ziemlich ins Stocken geraten, oder irr ich mich da?

Da du auf den Rest meines Post nicht näher eingegangen bist: Ist es für dich ein Ausschlusskriterium für die Wahl zum Bundespräsidenten, wenn dieser nicht die Abschaffung des Bankensystems fordert?

You should also try German bread. At the hotel, try the breakfast buns and the ""grey"" (wheat-rye) bread. Hotels, even good ones, don't usually have those in the highest quality, but they should be okay. Get big, soft pretzels as snacks downtown.

I am not really sure what the extreme right is talking about, but I can tell you that nobody on the left side of the political spectrum cares that much (if at all) about ""national pride"". The question is if you are going to work 12 hours per day for below subsistence wages. If you are going to work until 70 with a minimum pension ""because the economy is not Competitive"". If redistribution of wealth is ever going to happen again, and that's somehow a good thing because it motivates ""wealth creators"". 

By trashing the left's rhetoric to ""national pride"", something the left or the Anarchists never really cared about (I mean, do you really care if your exploiter is German, Italian or Mongolian?), he's lying willingly, trying to portray all alternative propositions as ""the same cake, different wrapping"".

When I lived in Vesterbro with my mother, the ""Byfornyelse"" wanted to remove the apartment-block we lived in, and so they started to offer new housing to everyone. We were the last to go, and the seasons had turned from fall to winter. 

We lived in two two-room apartments next to each other. Mum was in the one with heating (an old wood-fired stove), and I was in the one without - all I had was a [LNG-driven heater](http://img.diytrade.com/cdimg/928647/9101802/0/1242892414/gas_heater.jpg), which left the apartment terribly moist, and which couldn't be left on overnight.

Normally this wasn't a problem - I would run it for an hour or two every day, and then air out, and the place would be nice and warm for the next 24 hours or so.

But - when all of the neighbours had moved out, we couldn't share heat with our neighbours, like we used to - normally we would only lose heat to the walls facing the outside, and the ceiling, because we lived on the top floor, but now every wall was as cold as any other wall.

And one morning, during the winter, I woke up to see that my breath had formed frost on my bedframe. After that, I started to take the clothes I would wear the next day with me into bed, so they would be warm when I got dressed the next morning.

It's never really been too cold after that.

While those studies are considered easier, they also include lessons on education science. To become a teacher, you must have at least two such subjects and have done a unpaid Praktikum for a year at a school. Mileage may bary between different Länder, because education is not managed on a federal level.

""Quereinsteiger"", people who get into the job without a Lehramt, do exist, but are rare in the secondary education system. You mostly find those in the trade schools, where they are mostly engineers.

So when starting to pass by the truck I didn't see anyone else near us (as the highway was conveniently empty that day). As soon as I was beneath the truck the Audi showed up behind me which demonstrates his pace, those flashlights didn't seem friendly at all to me and he came as close as he could get to me - without any chance for me to get out of the way. He was just an idiot who wanted to continue driving his 200 km/h - which is fine with me as long as he doesn't harass me.

Still, great music all around (often quite blues-y) and great lyrics; Rio Reiser is well known for his amazing ballads (something which is very hard to pull off well in german), check them out at least.

The U.S. has far fewer train jumpers - because there are far less trains. I'd like to see a statistic which compares availability of train tracks and guns and the respective suicide rates using these methods between the U.S. and Germany.

en Navarra lo que más hay son visitas turísticas, te comento algunos lugares que puedes visitar, disculpa por el desorden:

- Visita por la parte vieja de Pamplona, murallas, catedral, recorrido de los toros, museo de Navarra.

- Las tres ciudades más grandes: Pamplona, Tudela y Estella. 

- Visitas interesantes: castillo de Olite, castillo de Javier, Roncesvalles, Aralar, monasterio de Leyre, santa María de Eunate, monasterio y bodegas de Iratxe, cuevas de Zugarramurdi, señorío de Bertiz, nacedero del Urederra, Sendaviva, cerco de Artajona, selva de Irati (precioso paisaje, lleva camara de fotos), valle de Roncal (buen queso). 

Hay muchisimo más para ver, pero ahora mismo no recuerdo más, si quieres consultar más cosas mira en la pagina web de [turismo de navarra](http://turismo.navarra.es/). 

En cuanto a actividades culturales, puedes consultar en [definde.com](http://www.definde.com/).

¿Como llegar a Estella?, en Navarra lo más fácil es moverse en coche, pero puedes utilizar el autobús para ir hasta Estella, en la estación de autobuses de Pamplona que está en el centro de la ciudad tienes autobus a donde necesites.

Yo te recomendaría, si tienes ocasión, que fueras de visita a San Sebastián, solo está a 45 minutos en autobús y es una ciudad preciosa, además de la playa tiene buena comida y buena juerga.

Si vienes en verano también puedes disfrutar de las fiestas populares de los pueblos cercanos, simplemente cuando estés aquí pregunta en que pueblo hay fiesta y te lo dirán. Eso si, normalmente consisten en: a) beber, b) música. Y si es en los pueblos de la ribera: c) vacas.

Sobre si 4-5 días son muchos, depende, para ver la ciudad solamente en 1 día la ves, para ver todo lo que te he comentado hacen falta días.

Si tienes cualquier duda pregunta :)

Zickendieb hat recht, der Vergleich mit dem DDR-Bankensystem bleibt absurd. Denn sogar wenn die Occupy-Bewegung eine staatliche Kontrolle der Banken fordern würde, und wenn dies gar zustande käme, wäre der Vergleich mit der DDR immer noch schief, denn der Demokratische Prozess funktioniert in unserem heutigen System marginal besser, will heissen, eine staatliche Kontrolle der Banken heute hätte ein demokratisches Element, da die Verantwortlichen zu einem entschieden grösseren Grade vom Volk bestimmt wären als in der DDR (wo es effektiv keine bürgerliche Mitbestimmung gab - das DDR-system war deshalb weder Kommunismus, noch Sozialismus, noch Demokratie - sondern eine Autokratie mit Sozialistischem Vokabular.)

Er kann den Occupy-Leuten ja gerne Naivität unterstellen, aber soviel Weitsicht sollte er doch haben, zu sehen, dass mit der Sozialen Gerechtigkeit in Deutschland etwas grundlegend falsch läuft (Kollektivierung der Risiken und Verluste, Individualisierung der Gewinne), und dass die Occupy-Bewegung ein Symptom davon ist, genau wie Stuttgart 21. Um auf deine Frage zu antworten: Natürlich sollte man nicht von einem Bundespräsidenten erwarten, dass er das Bankensystem abschafft. Aber man sollte von ihm erwarten, dass er Gesellschaftliche Strömungen wie Occupy und Stuttgart 21 erkennt als was sie sind, und aus seiner unabhängigen Position heraus die für die Gesellschaft wichtigen Aspekte dieser Bewegungen anspricht. Gauck hingegen merkt arrogant und dünkelhaft an, es sei sicher schnell vorbei. Ein Lupenreiner Autokrat.

My school was very chaotic). If you want to go to NRW and a few other states, you can teach at a Berufskolleg. That is comparable to the British college (3 years after high school. Permission to study at a university afterwards but still like a school and not like a college). They have a lot of ""Quereinsteiger"" as teachers and people who can help you.

You just get thrown into the job and don't have the time to prepare you like a Master of Education student who just has a few hours a week of school.

Lo mejor es que decidas de antemano que es lo que te interesa visitar y luego preguntar en la oficina de turismo como puedes hacer para llegar al sitio, normalmente tomarás un bus hasta una localidad cercana al lugar de la visita y para regresar lo mismo. No debe haber ningún tipo de problema.

Lo ideal sería acercarte a un lugar donde puedas ver varias cosas a la vez, por ejemplo si vas a Estella puedes ver a la vez el monasterio y la bodega de Iratxe, porque estan al lado, así aprovechas el viaje.

So yeah, probably nothing at all. The occasional extreme weather we experience is mostly normal variation.

No it does not mean the majority of scientists is wrong. They are at most only little wrong, being on the upper end of the error cascade. It is the random alarmists who are very wrong, being on the low end of the error cascade.

Fantastic town, drink their Koelsch (Muehlen, Sion, and Frueh were some of our favorites), and then piss a lot of people off by saying you prefer Altbier when in Koeln, and Koelsch while in Duesseldorf.

I think that this documentary was more about exploration of Greece than trying to give you some lesson or a bout loud of information about the subject.


For example I was shocked about the children. They don't have free school lunch there, even though they have a bloated public sector!? That is a whole new level of bad. But I was also frustrated that the woman who was being interviewed didn't even suggest this, instead they tried to do many other things that seemed to be more inefficient and expensive than offering just a simple meal. The great thing about a simple meal for a big number of people is that the more people you have, the cheaper it is to make the food per student.


I also noted that many people in Greece were ready admit that things have to change, for example the woman that shouted about fakeli, or for example the Australian shopkeeper who said that people are now asking for recipes.

Free lunch at schools... It drives me insane even thinking that someone thought there was something like that in Greece. Or free health care. Or a working justice system. Or anything in fact you would associate with a developed European Economy. 

When thinking of a bloated Greek public sector, don't think of government provisions.

Think of mafia like connections with a private sector that depends entirely on government subsidies.

I think this is *one* of the answers, but 

a) other countries have huge government sectors too, and they don't have this kind of problem, so why did the government sectors Greeks that you mentioned, then turn out to be lazy and corrupt.

It is also very ineffective, to the point that it's barely a functioning state. Why didn't they change that before, one need a properly working public sector to function, and the Greeks are educated, they should know that.


b)Productivity is low in other industries too, who are not owned by the government. Why? The fact is that Greece, compared to other countries don't have a lot of industries (apart from tourism).

What you are describing is (apart from the might be interesting on a personal level) what is *troubling* the Greeks, what the problems are, but not what the problem *with* them is.

For example, the documentary, could have answered at least some of questions I have, just from the top of my head.

* Why aren't they paying taxes
* Why have they accepted, for years and years, an enormous, ineffective sector. They are educated, why?
* Why have they accepted the budget deficits and the borrowing, since, well, forever
* Why is Greece so corrupt.
* Why did they build up a pension system that was one of the most generous in Europe (retiering way earlier, with more salary)? Don't anyone in Greece know basic math? It's no way it was sustainable? 
* Why haven't they done or protested before?
* Why are they protesting things that the rest of Europe have? I mean, we have been paying property taxes for decades, have a retirement age of 67, a higher VAT etc? Shouldn't it be fair to at least be on the same level?
* Why is the production so low?
* Why don't they have a lot of industries? 


This are just some questions, and I am sure they are interconnected. I don't mean that they are simple, but she didn't even attempt to answer most of them, instead she told us what problems they are having.

This is such a bullshit argument, specially when the fact that men are *dying* is taken into account. You take the fact that there are a few elite men at the top and ignore all the dregs at the bottom—who are overwhelmingly male. 

While most billionares and CEOs are men, most homeless people are also men. So are most people that commit suicide or that are victims of violence *in general* not just one particular subset of it. 

&gt;In return, more women suffer from domestic violence, human trafficing and discrimination at work compared to men.

Yet I'm sure all those women would still rather be alive. Oh no, workplace discrimination, the horror. I don't see feminists eager to not be discriminated when it comes to dangerous hard work such as logging which are overwhelmingly male fields; they only care about the cushy positions that the aforementioned elite enjoy. 

How can you even compare something that affects a tiny percentage of women, such as trafficking numbers that holds true for men in practically every country on Earth? Get some perspective. 

By the way, most rape victims in the United States are also believed to be male.

true,thelittlebig,NISA,Niedersachsen,"""Old and better"" is a very vague description. I am still a young lad of 22 years, so I learned only the new version in school. I think the switch was during my first years in elementary school. Although I find some things that are correct now to be horrid monsters of spelling and language (Atlasse) other changes were only logical (Taxis).  
To dismiss the whole thing in one clean sweep is a generalization every conscious speaker of our language should avoid. The entire debate was ideologically charged and did not reflect the actual arguements or facts presented, but much rather sentiments. The Neue Rechtschreibung gives the writer more freedoms and allows for many different spellings, in many cases the more German version is now as right as the more Latin/greek spelling. This reflects the integration of those words into our native language and the reasons to oppose this integration are fairly weak.  

In conclusion I'd just like to say that generalizing like this is dumb, while a serious debate of the reforms should be very much encouraged. ",0,1329858390,null,0,false,0,c3tjmrq,t3_pzdyu,t1_c3tjmrq,t1_c3tgabe,null,1428395078,5,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,5

In vielen Gegenden sah man den Schmetterling dann als Hexe, die in dieser Gestalt den Menschen die Milch bzw. den Rahm stiehlt. In die deutsche Literatur- sprache findet der Schmetterling übrigens um die Mitte des 18. Jahrhunderts, nachdem er sich um 1500 lokal als Schmettenling findet.

Foto was a legal variant before the Rechtsschreibreform and is a bad example. Let's use another one: Why not apply that rule to other words, such as Fonetik instead of Phonetik? Why Delfin but not Daufin? It seems that system is not very much improvement if it only solves *some* instances...

Second: So the older version already had phonological adjustments and an increase in their numbers is somehow wrong? Also Phonetik is in line with idea number one, where the Ph version is clearly the majority version. (Since it is mostly used in an academic context)

Third: I admitted to dass/das having reasonable grammatical grounds. My reason for objection is not that I want German to be a world language, I am perfectly fine with English as the Lingua franca. No, my reason for this is the large number of Germans that need to learn German. I.e. Italian, Turkish and Russian immigrants, often in the second or third generation. The nice Italian running the icecream shop at the corner should have a higher chance of learning our language and how it is spelled. I don't want to deny that those people have to make an effort, too. 
Furthermore you did not adress the MUCH more important first part of this point: What is your true German and how do you define it?

Fourth: American English and Received pronounciation in General suffer from not being dumbed down. After all English spelling isn't phonetic at all.

Last but not least: Thanks, I hope that I will. I am going home on Friday.

i'd agree with your predictions, and even be so bold as to say that i think Athletic will take it.

&gt;This is such a bullshit argument, specially when the fact that men are dying is taken into account. You take the fact that there are a few elite men at the top and ignore all the dregs at the bottom—who are overwhelmingly male.

Do you imply that women are not dying because of domestic violence and human trafficing? In addition to losing their lives, they also lose their dignity, they are being molested and harassed. They lose a lot more, mkay!


&gt; Yet I'm sure all those women would still rather be alive. 

I'm not so sure.


&gt; Oh no, workplace discrimination, the horror. I don't see feminists eager to not be discriminated when it comes to dangerous hard work such as logging which are overwhelmingly male fields; they only care about the cushy positions that the aforementioned elite enjoy.

Have you ever thought that women are not let to do this kind of work? Also, men do have plenty of alternatives to working hard manual labour.


&gt;How can you even compare something that affects a tiny percentage of women, such as trafficking numbers that holds true for men in practically every country on Earth? Get some perspective.

Are you serious!? What affects ""tiny percentage"" of women? Violence? Discrimination? Abuse? And what makes you think this does not effect women world-wide? Are all men sweating under hard labour? Are all men being violated? Yes, get some perspective!


&gt; By the way, most rape victims in the United States are also believed to be male.

Those are also taken into account in the overall data. Men are still, overwhelmingly, the biggest victims of violence—period.

Women are not *allowed* to do the work? Are you fucking kidding me? Do you have any evidence for that? Or is it maybe that women have better alternatives than this? They are certainly not starving for lack of work in first and second world countries. Instead they work in the cushy end of blue-collar jobs. 

What, do you think that men actually enjoy doing work that kills them, either little by little or outright?

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"In the growing acidic ocean scientists foresee a sudden drop in fish stocks (in just a couple of years) due to mass die off of plankton. This will hike prices on any type of sea food. 

On land, we're facing longer and longer dry spells and extreme seasons. Depletion of aquifers will lead to conflicts over rivers. Dams will cut countries dry (it has happened between Portugal and Spain). Icebergs could be towed in (happened in the UK). Farm land will dominate the landscape and everyone will necessarily be living out of it.

Brutal heat waves and cold fronts will take their toll on the old and the young. Tens or even hundreds of thousands could die annually from it instead of a few thousands each year.

I don't believe the current economical system can be maintained any longer with or without AGW, but AGW will definitely be strong a catalyst. Think of insurance company's losses, or the costs of dwindling resources like food, rare earth metals, minerals (like uranium), energy,etc. All things that are going down in quantity coupled with the added strain on getting them, like energy costs, transportation, environmental costs.

Health will become a problem given the pollution from industries and shale gas fracking. Antibiotics are becoming useless against germs and extreme weather weakens populations favoring diseases. Old diseases are returning with a vengeance, like TB. 

A lot more starvation due to scarcity. Return to local food production. Violence albeit under control. Ever higher taxes. An unavoidable complete privatization of health, education and social security will deprive the majority of it and will create more social asymmetries. 

Eventually people will be living in smaller communities. A return to city states. Local currencies, laws and independence from former centralized forms of government. 

7 billion people are impossible to sustain over time, even with current technology, no AGW or any other mishap along the way. The ecological footprint is simply unsustainable.

true,Phter,GREE,Greece,"Okay, while police force like that should never EVER happen, i've got a couple of things to say concerning this video. This is not a typical protest, this is clearly a riot, people just burning stuff and throwing objects at the police. These people may do it for many reasons, either genuinely expressing their rage, or want to cause a mess on purpose, it makes no difference since its still violence.

 Now these things also used to happen before the crisis, so i don't think comments like ""People must be starving there"" are appropriate.

Policemen in Greece (especially anti-riot police) are big jerks ( or let me rephrase that : untrained fanatics), everybody knows that and you can hear something like that daily. But this goes both ways, many or most of the ""protesters"" are just fanatics who need an excuse to break stuff. 

I don't see many people, especially greeks, pointing these stuff out enough. It may seem unimportant stating those differences, but my opinion is that these rioters are more harmfull to the real protest than the anti-riot police itself.",0,1329880338,null,0,false,0,c3tnwra,t3_pzwpz,t1_c3tnwra,t3_pzwpz,null,1428397160,41,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,41
