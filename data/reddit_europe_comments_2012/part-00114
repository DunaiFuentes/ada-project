It's the cheapest because it's made by the Renault people in a much cheaper place than France and in an automated factory. Really, Romania doesn't gain that much from the deal, except perhaps brand value (which is very unstable).  

If I go along with your question, I would actually prefer something reasonably sturdy and very efficient, but that's something that isn't for sale much. But I do get your point about quality.

Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many.... The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities demands, caeteris paribus, on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages....

I am an ERP consultant and often found it is ridiculously difficult and often next to impossible implementing North-Western European ERP software in Eastern Europe (Danish Navision in Hungary, Romania, Poland) for cultural differences. Same for Spain and sometimes Italy so we may say EE/SE (Eastern and Southern Europe.)

For the NWE users rights are no big deal. We just prevent people from doing some of the more sensitive things. In EE/SE employers are paranoid: no user should even see information they do not strictly need, and we must forbig them not to be able to copy-paste information like the customer list out of the system because they fear they would steal it.

In NWE the state assumes you won't cheat on your taxes. So for example if you pay your employees gas milaeage for using their cars visit customers, in the UK they must only collect some gas bills. Easy. In EE/SE they assume you will cheat so it is much more important, you must have a very exact travel log etc.

In NWE auditors and taxmen when look at your accounting they just want them it to be roughly correct. So for checking stock value, they will randomly look at 3-4 products and if it is OK they assume you are good. In EE/SE they will demand a printed FIFO list for every friggin' product proving the stock value based on the purchase invoices.

In NWE it is normal that basically your invoice is just a copy of your delivery note or even sales order confirmation with a different header, but the same information - product numbers, prices, total.  So typically you create invoices automatically in your ERP software and very rarely you need to credit it or modify it. In EE/SE it is crazy - your customer will tell you must invoice 50% to this company, 50% to that company but a different product number, and so on, you will have to reopen end edit and resend the invoices you sent 10 times. (The customer is trying to ""optimize"" taxes or maybe hide costs from the owners of the company to boost the stock price. Illlegal, but a lot of people give no fucks about illegality in EE/SE.)

In SE/EE people demand very exact specifications what they must do, because thy do not trust each other much and want to cover their asses, want to know exactly what is their respoinsibility. So for example in an ERP software they do not like optional fields, either you must do something or may not. NWE generally trusts employees, and wants flexible software and flexible demands on work. They assume employees want to and can figure out what is good for the company and need not to be threatened, hence much looser definitions of responsibilities.

Germany does not like customized software. They are NWE of course, but they only trust employees, not other companies: they like clear responsibilities and standardization between companies: someone should make a special software product for a special need and take full responsibility that it will work instead of a customization that is not guaranteed to work. The UK on the contrast is fully individualistic, they want everything customized, because they accept everybody wants thing their ways. Not just software. Even doors don't come in standard sizes so they must measure and custom-manufacture a door for every house! This sounds stupid but this is what companies like Permadoor do. Same for UK software they are willing to pay tens of thousands for a custom development and just trust it will work. EE/SE is similarly individualistic, but we can't afford it - and not trusting. It creates problems - in EE/SE you want everything custom but somehow still 100% reliable and will pay only after full delivery and it should be cheap. So people argue a lot.

Italians have one master skill much of EE/SE doesn't: they fully know they fuck everything up, so they prepare the system so that even if everybody fucks up, stuff still works. I am thinking things like the Ricevuta Bancaria system where you send your invoices to idiot customers who forget to pay you, but the bank collects it automatically anyway so it is not a problem. EE really needs this, but doesn't have.

This is only a few examples.

People talk about ""nationalism"" how about internationalism, globalisation ect?

Corporations are beginning to have more power than governments, that can't be a good thing surely?

Europe will have to federate if we want any say in world affairs. This isn't 1912 it's 2012, the nation state is being replaced by federations everywhere, India, China, Brazil will soon overtake the Europeans natural power and replace us as top dog.

We have to come to terms that if we want to have any power in the world and not within the next 20 years be dictated to by china, the south American union, African union ect and all the other booming economies and future federal states we ourselves have to fedralise.

A federation is not simply an excuse for having a powerful centeral government, don't get confused with utilitarian states such as the uk with ""devolved"" powers, a federal Europe will look more like the federal states of Australia, Germany or India than that of the US as many Europeans do not want a powerful federal government.

A federal state is a purely executive and part legislative union, culture really doesn't become a driving factor, only common aims... All this talk about us not being equal, the diversions are actually a good thing, imagine the USA if New York and California were both the same culturally?

Only a federal Europe with limited power will grant us any future presence on the world stage, the world is changing and we Europeans have to come together to become ourselves world leaders. We are more powerful economically and culturally than the US, united we would become the worlds No1 putting the superpower the US into 2nd place...

Europe will never be a USE, it will always contain more nationalism than fedralism, and that's good, it's what makes us who we are as Europeans, diverse and ready to come to each others aid as we have seen in ww2 and the many other conflicts.

Europe is a dormant superpower, why wait for it to fizzle out when we can become a new world leader together whilst retaining our cultural identities?

Beleive it or not... It is possible to be both European British/German/French ect, to any degree you want, some may feel more European than British, whilst some may feel more Scottish or Cornish than British, we are all European however, we share a common history, alliances and even culture (if you actually observe our tendencies and traditions all of which are similar and diverge from one another).

This is just wrong. There are many more similarities between European peoples than there are differences. The continent has a shared history that goes back over 2000 years. The languages of Europe are all related and they share so many words of common origin that you can make a whole language out of just those common words. Culturally most of Europe is based on Christianity. There are many shared values, such as the notion that there should be a decent social security and health care system subsidized by the government.

Sorry, aber ich bezweifle schon, dass man die relativ kleine Mitgliedergruppe der Piratenpartei als Beispiel für die Gesamtheit aller 20 bis 30-jährigen nutzen kann (obwohl ich schon glaube, dass die Beurteilung dieser Partei auch nicht ganz zutreffend ist; ich mag die Piratenpartei trotzdem nicht).

Other than that, your argument over finland not having enough influence, is no different than a small city within finland feeling they have not influence over the national election. They are a minority, and that's how democracy works.

Not arguing against you though, I think people are inherently selfish and they do feel that being born behind a certain arbitrary border somehow should give them more privileges than others, because it's always been like that.

&gt; „Die rechtlichen und philosophischen Aspekte von Gehorsam sind von enormer Bedeutung, sie sagen aber sehr wenig über das Verhalten der meisten Menschen in konkreten Situationen aus. Ich habe ein einfaches Experiment an der Yale-Universität durchgeführt, um herauszufinden, wie viel Schmerz ein gewöhnlicher Mitbürger einem anderen zufügen würde, einfach weil ihn ein Wissenschaftler dazu aufforderte. Starre Autorität stand gegen die stärksten moralischen Grundsätze der Teilnehmer, andere Menschen nicht zu verletzen, und obwohl den Testpersonen die Schmerzensschreie der Opfer in den Ohren klingelten, gewann in der Mehrzahl der Fälle die Autorität. Die extreme Bereitschaft von erwachsenen Menschen, einer Autorität fast beliebig weit zu folgen, ist das Hauptergebnis der Studie, und eine Tatsache, die dringendster Erklärung bedarf.“

&gt; ""The legal and philosophical aspects of obedience are of enormous importance but they don't say a lot about the behaviour of most people in concrete situations, though. I've done an easy experiment at the Yale University to discover how much pain a ordinary citizen would cause another because a scientist told them so. Stiff authority stood up against the strongest moral believes of the participants to not hurt other people and even though the pain screams of the victims ringed in the test subjects ears, the authority won in the majority of cases. The extreme willingness of adult people to follow an authority to an almost arbitrary amount is the main result of the study and a fact that needs explanation most urgently,

So... Either New Haven, Connecticut / the Yale university is full of Germans or we can make the assumption that this study is as representative for the USA as such a study would be in Germany, right? Right!

I haven't read the book you've posted but what can be worse than a majority of suspects torture somebody else to unbelievable pain.

Yes the media influences people but I didn't notice any biased opinion bullshit on real channels (that excludes everything that's connected to RTL and Pro7 except N24 I suppose). The news on the only German news channel I'd consider ""acceptable"" (N24) was as neutral as it was on CNN International (which is the only non-German news channel I get with DVB-T) and the same counts for our state TV (ARD, ZDF and the ""3rd programmes"" like WDR, NDR etc. probably count as state TV as well) which is probably more like old people TV and was very pro-ACTA but the news are pretty neutral as far as I know. Then again, the loud minority probably doesn't watch those channels

And yes we probably give authority more power than other countries. Nobody here would think it's weird that the police can demand an ID card or a passport any time they want but that's about it. Politicians don't have any kind of special authority. We make fun of them all the time and nobody is accepting a politician that fucked it up (I think Wulff would pretty much agree with that).

The military has even less authority. It was kind of normal that you tried to get rejected for military service before it became voluntarily. The military actually complained that they don't get enough support and recognition from the people (That was mentioned in the podcast ""Chaos Radio Express"" episode 184 which is made by the Chaos Computer Club which is basically a mixture of the Pirate Party (a lot of CCC members are active Pirate Party members as well) and Anonymous). That's how much fucks we give about the usual government bodies with authority.

And if you compare other aspects with other countries, it's still kind of ridiculous. What has authority as well? Parents? Well as far as I know [Americans in the south call their elders and parents Sir and Ma'am](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waC5lfc9Ptk) which is unthinkable in Germany.

Then what else? Your boss? Well I can't really talk about that because I can't compare Germany with other countries. I've seen people that would bend over for their boss as well as people that had a very friendly relationship to their boss with almost no authority at all.

Also, it's kind of ridiculous to call Germans the most brainwashed people when you've got posts and comments on reddit that talk about people that refused to treat cancer because Fox News said they shouldn't support Obama Care or American soldiers who see some kind of patriotic duty behind their military service (I remember some guy in a thread here calling the military a brotherhood and basically glorifying killing people to an extend that made me fell sick) oh and don't forget the crazy people putting religious authorities over the welfare of their children or the North Koreans that worship their dictator like a god.

Googling milk consumption, I feel over [this](http://www.foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu/intro.html) table. While I can't tell if the numbers are legit, it's interesting that northern European countries drink significantly more milk than their southern and western neighbours. Taking a wild guess, I'd say that this has been the case for quite a few years. This means that the distribution networks of milk in especially Scandinavia are widely developed and efficient, while geographically larger, less milk-consuming countries have less milk production per capita and a less developed infrastructure for milk distribution. A less developed, or more far-stretched distribution network could mean that fresh milk is harder to bring to the stores, without the process taking so long time the milk won't be fresh.

A dairy-producer in France would then be less certain a given costumer would buy milk (which then not necessarily would be the brand at hand), and he would have to calculate longer transport and distribution costs which are vital when delivering fresh milk. All this gives the producers more incentive to sell their milk as UHT. As the cycle goes, over time people get accustomed to the taste of UHT-milk, and it becomes normal to buy it. Compare this to a smaller country like Denmark. Our biggest food supplier, Arla Foods, have a brand of milk which is guaranteed to be available for sale within 24 hours of milking *and available all over Denmark*. Would that be possible in a larger country, with more uncertainty, and less efficient/more time-consuming infrastructure?

Maybe, this is part of the explanation.",0,1346083764,null,0,false,0,c5zhfm2,t3_ywixo,t1_c5zhfm2,t1_c5zguki,null,1429748391,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

I simply do not believe that for one moment.

One of the great things about the internet is that we, as individuals, can talk to each other and see how much we truly have in common.

I was surprised when I used to talk to people in other countries on Compuserve, when I was a teenager, how similar almost everyone is in what they wish to get out of life.

I learned that I had more in common with people on the other side of the world than I did with the people who were supposed to represent me.

I have talked to so many people from so many different countries and I see no real discernible difference between us. 

Your idea that we have no or little commonality is, to me, the definition of Nationalism. You still buy into the idea of culture and unnecessary, arbitrary national boundaries to define yourself. 

Well, that's bullshit. What defines us is what we want out of life and, in that, the majority of the common people of the world are extremely similar.

I have, in my adulthood, travelled to many different countries, experienced many different cultures and 'values' and, yet, everyone I have met has the same dreams and motivations, the same needs, the same hopes and the same fears.

Culture, values, and nations are all so much hot air when our core motivations are the same. Our cultures may define the means to express those motivations but, at the heart of it all, we are truly no different.

And Iran and North Korea aren't banning pop culture - they're banning *Western influenced* pop culture. Of course they have their own catchy melodies (usually influenced indirectly by West, as well). As you can read from this article about [North Korea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_North_Korea).

The Protestant/Catholic division (stemming from the Reformation) is well researched subject and not simply a stereotype. You should look into it. A fascinating topic! Basically, in the North government has taken over everything that in the South is operated by the Catholic church (even the priests are government trained and in their work operate as government officials). It truly is really grand topic and explains many things. Basically it makes a great divide on values, going through Germany and France. There are several other ramifications on all this, but I don't think you are interested in reading on this on reddit right now; I suggest you google it! 

On stereotypes; yes, there are different kind of people everywhere. But things like this aren't absolute; this isn't something where you list ""1"" as something and ""10"" as it's opposite and then try to grade different nations somewhere in between. To take a simple example, getting kissed in South Europe is common greeting, in North it would be a sign of some serious interest. Are the Northern people more cold then?

Oh, and one major difference between Italian and English will bite you a little here. There is no difference in Italian between ""Steven played with his doll"" and ""Steven played with her doll"". Unlike English, the ""his/her"" agrees with the gender of the word doll, not with the subject's name (Steven). You'll note that GT gives the same result for both phrases. Since ""doll"" is feminine, a male or female playing with it will use the same sentence. Only as a pronoun do you get a difference. ""He played with its doll"" will be different from ""She played with its doll"". But once you use a name, the difference goes away. Most of your other gender differences are good, though, and as far as I know, should play well to an Italian audience, who are far less politically correct about gender differences than we are.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;I used the term 'pop culture"" as ""western influenced pop culture"", they ban it because it's something that is very likely to influence the minds of the young.

Fair enough.

&gt;You're right about Catholic/Prothestant division, it's very interesting historically but not that relevant nowadays. Less and less people adhere to traditional Catholic/Prothestant values.

The divide has very little to do with religion! Or actually, it has everything to do where faith that used to go to the Church has been put. The main difference of the divide was that in the North all political power stems from the State; there are no Protestant Schools, no Protestant Hospitals, No Protestant Monasteries etc. Most charities and privately run associations are actually run with money from the State - heck, [even the church itself is tax funded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_tax) (and the priests are government officials, as I said). 

Basically, if it isn't directly owned by some company, it's probably operating with government funds, whatever it is. And even private companies are often subsidised.  

This is the first part.

The second part is, that for hundreds of years the church has taught that ""he who doesn't work, will not eat"" and similar lines (priests were also used for state-announcements instead of town criers till fairly recently; the masses were also indirectly influenced by state). At this point, this stuff isn't part of the religion anymore, they are part of the cultural atmosphere. I'm an Atheist, and most of my teachers were (at least) agnostic, but I still know a truck-load of Bible-sayings. Most to the effect that you should work really, really hard just to be an ok member of society. Stuff like that. This permutes through the whole society. In similar ways Catholic institutions, values and teachings are passed down in the South, even if the religious meaning behind the words is lost.

There's also the fact that all the faith that in the South is divided between Church-institutions and State-institutions (and apparently these institutions are sometimes at odds, so you hear about their failings), here it all comes from the State, and State never argues with itself. And if something was wrong with the State, it's wrong with the society, because State IS the society. This leads to stuff like even the most state disenfranchised anarchist in Northern Europe claiming that everything wrong with Greek state is wrong with the Greek people, because these two things are the same (I'm generalising a lot here, but that's the gist). 

&gt;Everywhere I've been in Europe it was common to kiss on the cheek as a greeting..

I've visited, travelled and/or lived in all the Protestant countries and this isn't the custom in any of them. I suggest that next summer (or sometime soon:) you take a project and come to visit - you might be awe-stuck what differences there are. I understand that you've met Nordic people before, but we tend to think that trying to downplay or even hide any cultural special traits is courteous when dealing with people outside the culture. 

&gt;I used extrovert/introvert as a reference to how stereotypes show Southern people as very chatty/loud/enjoying to socialize in large groups and Northen people as the opposite. I'm by no means a psychology expert but I don't see why it was wrong.

The difference between extrovert and introvert isn't partying or lack of it, the difference is that when extrovert is tired or sad, he seeks company (because company is relaxing); when introvert is tired, he wants to sit at home and read a book (because that's what HE finds relaxing). 

Introvert might be really good at social skills and enjoy being with people, but it's an exercise, like going for a walk. Similarly, extrovert might like reading really much, but afterwards he would like to relax in a company. To continue; the extrovert might be socially inept boor, but he'd still be an extrovert if he seeks company to relax :)

Lousy article btw. Portugal's problem is that there is two Portugal's. *Their's* Portugal, that is permeated with corruption and with which few identify with (see levels of voting absenteeism and tax evasion), and the socially cohesive traditional *Our* Portugal. People are not generally selfish or committed just to themselves, in fact they're quite the opposite. What happens is they don't trust politicians and with good reason. Dictatorships, censorship, elitism's, the corporate/party hijacking of  1974's revolution, constant scandals and bad examples, plundering of resources and state wealth, a multi-tiered justice system that is an international joke and that imprisons the poor while laxing on the wealthy. People notice all this growing social assimmetry and they don't see their pornographically high tax money put to good use and any good thing they see built or improved they mostly attribute that to the EU. Why bother? Pessimism kicks in. It's not like it can be easily changed and new faces are more of the same. It needs a complete overhaul and that only comes with an extreme event, such as a revolution or (wait for it) a European federalization event.

Freedom, democracy, responsibility, justice, rule of law... aren't these values shared?

It's the same currency, isn't it? A Cornetto at the beach costs about 1.20€

I like your sausages. btw, does any German here also enjoy playing Civilization IV, listening to Cosmo Klein or watching Breaking Bad?

&gt;language

We don't have the same language but we do are still able to communicate, right?

&gt;We do not hear the same music

Rihanna, Linking Park, Pitbull, David Guetta... if these aren't broadcast in German radio, then fair point, if not, sorry. Oh, and if that's the case, I'm much closer culturally to a Dutch nightclub than to my grandmother.

&gt;eat the same food

I haven't eaten McDonalds in ages as that is the classic example but I've recently drank Coca-Cola and my lunch today was cooked potatoes with pig and my dinner was a soup with rice and a fried egg. Is it that different from the food there?

They dip a piece of textile in wine and let the boy suck it. There's no harm. If this is unacceptable to you you guys might have a look at France. When visiting our family there the children always got a few glasses wine stretched with water. And I, my siblings and my cousins turned as respectable and valuable members of the society.

I mean, all of us twenty somethings never did anything wrong, we're not antisemites. We despise the Nazis for what they did so can't this guy just leave us alone with this crap?

Consider:

* many breeds of cows are bred for milk production, and give milk with a very high fat content - 4.2% or so - whereas UHT milk follows the standards - ""whole milk"" or ""full fat milk"" which is typically around 3%, or ""skimt/skimmed milk"" which is down at 0.5-1%. A single % difference in fat content is very easy to taste to most people.

* UHT-treated milk is heated to 280^o F for at least two seconds - that's a lot of heat for a long time. When this happens, many of the proteins in the milk undergo structural changes - some sulphur-holding molecules are ""turned"" so the sulphur is accessible from the outside (as far as I recall) - these are very radical. For example, UHT-milk can't be used for yogurt or kefir - the structure of the molecules are changed so radically that it can't uphold microbial life (of the sort that's used to life off milk).

Getting a gig in the US is relatively easy compared to Italy...
Sadly, in Italy, the market is different and since that the majority of popular music is in English the live gig demand is fairly low.
Don't get me wrong, we do have popular Italian singers, but it is very hard to see someone playing a live acoustic gig in a small bar somewhere here. First of all, a bar in Italy is someplace where you stop for coffee and spend no more than a couple of minutes in there (that's usually the case). Then you have bars where the older crowd hangs out (and I mean, fellas in their sixties and seventies) and the bars where the younger crowd hangs out. The ones that stay open after dinner are usually the ones that attract the younger crowds, and most likely are either downtown or inside a square (piazza/piazzetta).
But a bar is a place where you sit around a small table and have a coffee or a drink before going out to a club (discoteca, locale, or most of the time referred with it's name: ""andiamo al Bellina"").
So a lot of American friends that I have came to Italy and asked direction to the closest bar and the result was confusing both to them and to the owner of the place, whom is usually curious why someone is ordering a Jaeger bomb at 5 in the afternoon in a small bar that serves mostly workers that get off the train that takes them home.

There are exceptions. During the summer some popular bars do hire some musicians that can play small acts (and quite ones) to entertain the customers. Usually these bars are either close to a pizza or in some vacationing location, like some towns that have lots of bars close to the beach.

But mostly people go out to a locale to hear djs. Well, actually they don't even care about what music is playing most of the times... they just go there to go nuts and have fun. There are some places like magazzini generali in Milan that target certain crowds by hosting electronic musicians and djs, and rarely you'll see people go to such places ""just to spend a night out"". They wanna go there and either listen to German techno/dubstep/tech house and so on.

Clubs usually hire some musicians early in the evening, like after dinner and/or during dinner, to entertain the guests. But most of the times at around 10 or 11 (some rare cases at midnight) the djs will take over. Mostly is top 40 music.

Or instead of a small band or a single musician they have karaoke. Not Asian style, the kind you have in the US, too. Usually they do have a guy that runs the midi and maybe also plays guitar or keys and accompanies the singer. By the way, being bilingual, I always hear some crazy, made up words and or accents that belong nowhere and it's hilarious. Or the always classic ""all the, small things""=""naa noo, gnon gnin"". You'll get a chance to hear such things. 

What you can do is try to look for a band that is seeking a musician. There's actually a lot of them, and if you are lucky you'll find one that is kind of already introduced to the scenes. This way you'll have a chance to play some gigs. Otherwise, you can try with karaoke or just asking around popular bars. I warn you that it will be very hard to find an owner that will agree to turn the music off to have one musician play, but hey, you never know.

But this is just a broad generic view of the scene. You have to know that 90% of the time the reason why you get a gig is because you know someone that knows someone. Sometimes it takes months or years of work... building a network is what you would need to do.

Look on local newspaper under the ""annunci"" and see if someone is in need.

Having said all this... the music business is... well I don't even know how to describe it. For all I know you could be the next Hendrix, so please read my post and count it more of a personal opinion than a professional one. Don't fail to tell everyone that you are a musician and don't fail to ask if anyone knows of any band/locale/bar in need.

For example if I was an italian musician and I had the chance to work with someone from the US I totally would. It's a great chance to hear a proper accent and exchange point of views and opinions.

Non-recognition of other streams of Judaism such as Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism is the cause of some controversy; rabbis belonging to these currents are not recognized as such by state institutions and marriages performed by them are not recognized as valid. As of 2011 marriage in Israel provides no provision for civil marriage, marriage between people of different religions, marriages by people who do not belong to one of nine recognised religious communities, or same-sex marriages, although there is recognition of marriages performed abroad.

Israel doesn't even recognize JEWISH RABBIS who are not part of the Orthodox sect, and doesn't allow any marriages except by Orthodox rabbis. There is NO Civil marriage.
Chasidim are exempt from the draft (even non-Chasidic Girls are drafted) and Chasidic men are paid welfare by the state to study religion and not work. There are special roads that can be used only by Jews. Jews can openly carry weapons, but muslims cannot.

It would help if you told us some of the bands you light, so we can try to find stuff that fits your tastes. Anyway, I'm gonna list some bands/authors from other -maybe a little bit more underground- styles.

Here's some spanish hard rock bands

* [Rosendo - Maneras de Vivir](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUJClv5c0H4)
* [Los suaves - Palabras para Julia] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKc8ub5rj-U)
* [Los enemigos - La cuenta atrás](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s_O0MRT0zA)
* [Reincidentes - Ay Dolores](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0_xkYje0yE)  
* [Extremoduro - Romperás](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyMMFklgWkw)
* [Marea - Corazón de Mimbre](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meO_JpGzP6Y)
* [Platero y Tú - El Roce de tu Cuerpo] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oApqXiCbqjo)

If you want to go for the cultural thing, you gotta give Flamenco a try

* [Camarón y Paco de Lucia - Como el agua] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIueBl56MV8)  
* [Jose Mercé - Aire] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzxyefhCQXg)  
* [Bebo Valdés y Diego el Cigala - Lágrimas Negras] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb_TDpOlDEQ)  
* [José el frances - Sangre de mi corazón] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYsljtARIk)  
* [Duquende - Andar y andar] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CboXYY8_n3I)  

It could be difficult to understand but you can try spanish Hip Hop too. Here's a few bands:

* [Nach - El idioma de los dioses] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPqS0Y5-2L4)
* [Juaninacka - El lenguaje del corazón] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2znbD8i4mI)
* [Violadores del Verso - Las cosas por su nombre] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hk7WwFz_Go)
* [Mala Rodriguez - Por la noche] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nawuHf66fKQ)
* [La excepcion - Amos chacho] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H0wxzlSols)

Some bands that don't really fit the usual labels:

* O'Funk'Illo mixes a lot of styles, although as their name implies they try to start from funk. They can be a little difficult to understand, they use a lot of slang and have a heavy accent from Andalusia. [O'funk'illo - Rulando] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRLtyihVeyo) 
* Albert Plá makes whatever he wants, though he has whole albums dedicated to rumba. His voice and his pronounciation make it quite difficult to understand. His lyrics are pretty subversive, witty and sarcastic. [Albert Plá - Joaquin el necio] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NGUMaGZ_d4) 
* Tony Zenet makes a nice case for blues in Spain [Tony Zenet - Un beso de esos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqoWiT-MTNk)
* There's a few punk rock bands out there. This band is really underground but they make a really good and original folk-punk. If you like bands such as Dropkick Murphys, this is quite similar. [Ixo Rai - Canción de Amor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLpGOXuMGEY) 

I guess we could go on and on, but as I said it would help a lot if we knew what kind of music you're into.

I hope this helps!

**DISCLAIMER: I'm an ancient art historian, also atheist.**

The ONLY reason why we today have the Parthenon, Pantheon, Colosseum, etc. are precisely those Christians. First, they turned ancient monuments into churches, thus preserving them far better than if they had been left on their own. An overwhelming (I'd guesstimate around 90%) of still standing temples are alive because the Christians reused them. And they haven't modified much, when they reused them! Secondly, even *legally*, as early as 5th century, the Christian authorities in Rome made strict laws outlawing any sort of desecration of pagan architecture. Of course, the people on the streets would sometimes act otherwise (which is why many heads on the relief marbles are knocked out) but the laws were surprisingly ""tolerant"" of the splendor of antiquity.

Britain is less reliant on intra-EU trade than Germany, which is what really matters. Whether we tick the box for sexy export market du-jour is much less important.

It is also unclear whether your talk of exports is goods only, or both goods and services combined which crossed the 50% threshold two years ago!

Do you accept that the EU has a cost as well as a value, and that while it is preferable to be inside for reasons of trade it may come at the cost of joining whatever federal entity emerges from the euro crisis?

A straight answer please; if you are willing to argue for EU trade benefits come what may then say so plainly............

Yes, the UK may well be able to birth a new EU that surrounds the core of federalised euro nations for ourselves and like-minded neighbours, thus making EFTA irrelevant.

However, what say you if Britain can't achieve this glorious new union?

I'll add:

Entry Level:

- Lori Meyers, spanish indie pop / rock. Standard spanish (no accent) and good lyrics.

- Love of Lesbian, same.

- Nacho Vegas (""El hombre que casi conoció a Michi Panero""). Great song. (thanks for reminding me of him, MrFalken.

Medium Level: 

- Bunbury. Used to be in one of the greatest heavy metal bands here (Héroes del Silencio). Then he went solo and makes pretty cool music. More lyrical than the guys at Entry level, but you could use it as a Lesson#2.

Advanced Level: 

- Joaquín Sabina. Spanish singer/songwriter. Lots of words, literally, very broad vocabulary. Good and clear pronounciation, but his music's very lyrical, so don't take him as a first step! On a more personal note, I really hope you succeed in studying spanish, because Joaquin Sabina is a BEAST :)

To have a idea, there was multiple wars when the revolution happened, a small country having multiple wars in different zones at the same time, can you imagine what it did to the population and to the economy? After the revolution and the colony independance there were thousands upon thousands of refugees fleeing from the new indepent countries with no money, no job, no nothing. There was also a huge fight for power since the revolution happened in the middle of the cold war and there was soviet backed communist trying to get to power so it was anything but a stable democracy for some time.

But that is nothing compared with the two big mantras of the regime, that uneducated people were easy to control and proudly alone. This made the country had 2/3 of illterate population and no exportation of note since the country should have has little contact with the outside has possible.

What you and a lot of people here including many young Portuguese miss is that the country they see now had nothing to do with the country 20 years ago, they see a country with healthcare, education and infrastuctures equal to any european country, but 20 years ago that simply din't exist everything had to be built.

For example, people look at the country now and see the country with the lowest infant mortality in the world but forget that 20 years ago it had the highest infant mortality in OCDE. They look now and see a higher % of people in universities than France and Germany but they forget that 30 years ago 1/3 of the population din't even know how to read.

The integration thing is a bit unfair, I dont want a unitary state, but meh, check it out.

As for the other political compass:
Economic Left/Right: -4.88
Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -5.64

I like to think of self as a liberal center lefty so I'm ok with this... I think everything feels somehow skewed though.

Last time I did it in May I got:

I've only seen large-scale pasteurizers, and they use this really clever system (and I don't know the english term for it - warmth-changing?)

the cold milk is lead through a pipe with a flat side (it's shaped like a D) and into the heater, where it is heated to 80^o C (I think - maybe 85). It's then led back through another pipe that also had a flat side.

The two flat sides are connected. When the hot milk comes out of the heater, it's cooled down by the cold milk coming the other way.

Also, the cold milk going to the heater, is pre-heated by the warm milk coming the other way.

The good things about this is:

You don't have to use as much energy, since the heat is re-used.

The milk isn't heated for more than a few seconds, so the taste isn't affected as much.

But you have to have enough milk to run it for a while - and when I googled this just now, I can see that no-one makes machines like this for just a single cow or two..

Correct me if I'm wrong, but NATO's intervention in Libya was supported by the Arab League. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that any military intervention in Syria would be conducted by NATO, at the request and supported by the Arab League, given that it is the most important organization in that region. The problem is that many people, especially in the Middle East, will assume that NATO intervention is neo-colonial intervention, which is why support from the Arab League is essential.

If anything take pressure off Turkey beyond humanitarian aid, because getting either NATO or Israel involved is exactly how it will escalate.  It's a little too geocentric for China and Russia to just turn a blind eye to too.

At least some good has come out of all this.  I just got to say 'to too'.

&gt;If they do intervene, the new government will be very grateful.

Which assumes there would be a new government, that there should be a new government and as a Westerner I don't think that's remotely close to being our call to make.  That they would remain grateful, which recent history shows is rarely the case.  The form this new government would take, which recent history warns about again.  The rise in militancy and the wider effects another Western intervention might have.

Sure, they might be very grateful and a marked improvement and what the people want, but it could just as easily blowback.

The Arab revolutions of 2011 have been completely different, there have been no figureheads, one could argue Bouazizi but he's dead and was a Tunisian market trader.

You think in national terms, but since people are slowly starting to build European identities, they might feel that France's or Spain's colonial status was something of the former glory of Europe. I've heard Romanians referring to events of Western Europe in very personal ways out of a shared sense of European-ness.

&gt;you are mistaking a reason of convenience (keeping former status) with necessity of survival (annexation by neighbours)

Annexation by neighbours is not the only threat to one's survival. A superpower can dominate a smaller country economically just fine. Or politically. Think about the US's relation to Latin America or how most of Eastern Europe wasn't annexed by the USSR.

&gt;True, Russia is and remains scary for the Eastern block, but the Eastern Block just regained their independence and are probably not in a hurry to lose it completely again.

Au contraire. I feel that a lot of people in the East have understood that small states get bullied by big ones, no matter how independent. So banding together, preferably with some important western states too seems logical.

&gt;Also please remember that in Switzerland decisions like changes in the constitution (or even normal laws) are always voted on by the citizens, and never just decided by the ruling governments.

Not so actually, not in the sense that it was clear that the Ayatollahs would inherit.  There was a lot of unknowns as to who or what would take over.  It was by no means a solid thing - like you say, he wasn't even in the country, and there were plenty of groups that certainly weren't fighting for the Ayatollahs.  

It is in this sense that the comparison is fair.  Nobody actually knows what will inherit Syria if the Syrian government falls. There in lies the dilemma.

&gt;Regarding the assumption there would be a new government, that's the only legitimate outcome here.

That sort of rhetoric scares me because we have no call on the matter of what and what is not 'only legitimate'.  We can't even be sure as to the extent and the actions of the rebels.  There's certainly a lot of counter intelligence coming out with no real way of discerning exactly what is happening and by whom.

Containment might also be considered an equally 'legitmate' conclusion, as one man's illegitimate government is another man's legitimate one under attack.

What if through regional pressure and alienation a ceasefire is called and certain assurances provided.  It might take the Syrians another 10-20 years of protest before they secure elections and in the interim the current government stays.  If that averts full out civil war with far greater losses wouldn't that be a more legitimate outcome?  That happened in Egypt.

What if under heavy international condemnation from its Arab League friends elections are conceded and international observers guarantee a fair election but the Syrian government wins.  Wouldn't that be legitimate?

true,CannibalHolocaust,null,null,"&gt;I do, and I didn't say it was the same thing, I said there were comparisons to be made, and there are.
Even after the Iranian revolution it wasn't even clear to them immediately who would step into the vacuum. It was by no means a clear thing that it would be the Ayatollahs. They just emerged the strongest from it and were able to coalesce support around them. In that same sense, and this is all I am saying, nobody knows what would replace a successful Syrian revolution when it is far more complicated.

The comparisons are weak at best, and you're severely downplaying the role of Ayatollah Khomeini. In the 1979 protests, there were giant portraits of him being lifted up by huge crowds demanding his return from exile and the removal of the Shah. He initially did not want power but there was tremendous pressure on him to take it. Once he did take it, he assumed the role of protector of the people and coupled with the revolutionary guard and the Iraqi invasion maintained a tight grip on power.

As mentioned the best comparison here is Libya which also had a similar uprising recently and a transitional council in place headed by Mahmoud Jibril. Syria already has one in place which is ready to take over if/when Assad falls. I don't know why you're trying to make this part seem ambiguous.

&gt;As such making calls for what should happen or arguing Western intervention might just make matters worse.

Of course it 'might' no-one has a crystal ball which can predict the future. This isn't really an argument though.

&gt;You didn't say that. You said the 'only legitimate' outcome would be the toppling of the current government, with the emphasis on only. That clearly isn't the case. There are several possible outcomes were more harm might be caused, or less harm assured. Western intervention could well make it much worse and the region less stable.

Correct. It is the only legitimate outcome, Assad's regime must stand trial for crimes against humanity and face prosecution.

&gt;That would be an alternative to your 'only legitimate' outcome. That the Assad government doesn't fall. Another alternative might even be a referendum before an election, and that too would be another legitimate outcome.

That's not an alternative, the pre-requisite to elections would be the removal of the Assad regime and for them to stand trial. The pro-Assad political party would not be the same thing as the regime it would merely be supporters of his regime. They would have the right to contest free and fair elections, not Assad himself or the regime. They would need to face the consequences of their actions in being responsible for the massacre of civilians. To clarify, there is no way Bashar Al-Assad or the regime would be allowed to contest elections by forming a political party.",0,1346170860,null,0,false,0,c6002xv,t3_yyghu,t1_c6002xv,t1_c5zzuz9,null,1429757321,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/swm7u/can_i_get_a_quick_french_politics_lesson_im/

There are two major political parties: UMP (Union pour un Mouvement Populaire - Union for a Popular Movement), the right, conservative party, and PS (Parti Socialiste - Socialist Party - but, do not understand socialist as in USSR socialism here, it's still a capitalist party), the big left party. Nicolas Sarkozy (our president) comes from UMP and is candidate to his own succession. François Hollande (PS) has the most chance to be elected in the current elections.

Presidential elections have two rounds: during the first round, we chose between any candidate that can prove that 500 mayors vouched for them by giving them a signature (for instance, you could try to be candidate to defend any fantasy topic but I doubt 500 mayors would vouch for you as being essential to the democratic debate, so you wouldn't make it to the first round). Realize that we have around 36 000 cities or villages in France, so around 36 000 mayors, but a lot of mayors will be faithful to their party (like UMP or PS) and give their signature to a candidate like Sarkozy or Hollande. It's really a fight for small candidates to get the 500.

We voted last Sunday and chose between Eva Joly (Green, ecologist party), Marine Le Pen (far-right, extremist party), Nicolas Sarkozy (UMP, actual president), Jean-Luc Mélenchon (extreme left), Philippe Poutou (communist), Nathalie Arthaud (communist), Jacques Cheminade (weird guy...don't know how he got 500 signatures), François Bayrou (the center, he has a party between UMP and PS), Nicolas Dupont-Aignan (on the very right...almost as extremist as Le Pen) and François Hollande (PS).

The scores were the following:

François Hollande 28,63 %              
Nicolas Sarkozy 27,18 %             
Marine Le Pen 17,90 %               
Jean-Luc Mélenchon 11,10 %             
François Bayrou 9,13 %             
Eva Joly 2,31 %             
Nicolas Dupont-Aignan 1,79 %                
Philippe Poutou 1,15 %              
Nathalie Arthaud 0,56 %             
Jacques Cheminade 0,25 %

As you can see, the Parti Socialiste candidate took the lead, mostly because people are fed up of the austerity measures brought in Europe because of the financial crisis. Sarkozy supporters think that Parti Socialiste will lead the country to the ruin (because they want to spend more money to get more growth) whereas Hollande supporters think that Sarkozy's politic is unfair to the poor and supportive to rich people.

You can also see that people lost a bit of their faith in politics when they vote so much for the extremes (Le Pen has a really bad reputation, her father was also a very controversial political leader, saying things such has ""concentration camps are a detail in History"" - you see the picture). Mélenchon was also a big surprise, since he has been really strong in these elections, again because people are fed up with the big financial institutions.

As Sarkozy &amp; Hollande got the highest scores, we will vote between them in the 2nd round to determine who will be our next president (we vote May 6th). As I said, Hollande is now leading the polls so he has a lot of chances to be elected.

Sarkozy was 100% pro-american, getting along quite well with Merkel (in Germany) which is essential because France-Germany are known to be the ""motor"" of Europe. Hollande will withdraw our troops in Afghanistan one year sooner (will be a bad start for his relationship with the US) and opposes Merkel's politic (she hates him and refused to meet him until now). Sarkozy has more experience and is a better leader IMO, but Hollande is more fair, very intelligent and could do a lot of good to our country.

I could go way deeper, but I'm not an expert at all and I'm running out of time. I hope it helps since I explained the best I could with my own words and as I told you, I have no qualifications whatsoever for doing so!

* Germany wants to include everybody, and thus wants to have EU treaty. While the new treaty would make the union to have two tiers officially, it wouldn't exclude or put unnecessary obstacles for outside countries to join the core.
* However if Germany can't include everybody, then there will be a new treaty, one of exclusion, one that only covers Eurozone countries and will dive a wedge between the Euroarea and non-Euro countries. This is more or less what France would want, a tighter but more deeper union where it would have more power than it currently has.
* For other Eurozone states than Germany or France I would guess that it is the same. There are problems and those problems need to be fixed by deepening the union, and that calls for a new treaty. It really doesn't much is it EU or Eurozone treaty, nobody else has any option than to follow.

Now in case you are wondering why I am not talking about non-Eurozone states is because they don't matter. If we have worst case scenario where economic situation calls for deeper union, but non-Eurozone states prevent a new treaty, then we will have a situation where the rest of the union is more or less ejected to EEA and the core goes on.

A very large proportion lives and works in France very much legally with little to no problems: they have French citizenship and have special rights given their nomadic lifestyle. They are called ""Gens du Voyage"" or ""Journey People"". They are roma, but most have been in France for generations, and they are descendants of the nomadic gypsies you find in many stories/movies here.

The roma who are expelled are a different case: they are of romanian citizenship and emigrated to France fairly recently. Before 2007, a large number of them came to France illegally (as Romania wasn't a member of the EU). They now come legally, but under the special status that Bulgaria and Romania are in right now, they can't work legally in France (or other EU countries for that matter). That will change soon, as the special status should be revoked in the coming years. Until that time, they have to apply for a working permit like other non-EU citizen, and those permits are limited to a few professions. The new left-wing has done and is doing a few things to try and help them integrate better. The number of professions open to foreigners was reduced by the previous government from 120 to 22; the current government has reverted that measure so the number is once again 120. There are talks of opening more professions to the roma.

That said, to continue with these useless and costly expulsions is a real let down. They are useless as these people can once again come legally to France. They are costly as we pay every person who returns to Romania 300 Euros (half for children), and the trip back... I had hoped the socialists would instead try integration measures. Hopefully, the current actions were more due to political inertia in the ministry. As for an actual solution... Not easy integration of the roma is a big issue all across Europe, as is [Antiziganism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiziganism). Like with most problem between communities, there is no silver bullet. Personnally, I believe that equal access to education will go a long way.
