Because over there authoritarianism is still overt, and dominant.

Yes, because the definition of ""European"" changes over time.

&gt;I too have many russian friends and I don't perceive their mentalities and culture as that different to western ones.

Bad wording on my part. I consider _Russia_ culturally non-European, that doesn't mean that there aren't plenty of people there who'd be considered Europeans;)

You don't know this.

&gt;you only need to see how much hate is being directed to the government right now because of what their doing.

Yup, because it's only news if people disagree and protest, people who agree and have no problems don't go out of their way to demonstrate their support.

If the responsibility laid more with the people, you'd have less scapegoating others for everyone's problems and less protests and strikes because if elections were more frequent, those who went against what had just been decided by all would have much less support.

You are a Nazi piece of shit, but for the sake of argument, I'll reply and do so with exactly the level of respect you deserve.

&gt;Anti-whites loves to whine about white colonization past

Yes, because colonization in the past was absolutely brutal. Perhaps trash like yourself should crack a history book before you start making comparisons.

Start with the [Congo Free State](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State#Humanitarian_disaster) - ""*Failure to meet the rubber collection quotas was punishable by death. Meanwhile, the Force Publique were required to provide a hand of their victims as proof when they had shot and killed someone*"" [...] ""*The collection of hands became an end in itself. Force Publique soldiers brought them to the stations in place of rubber; they even went out to harvest them instead of rubber... They became a sort of currency.*"" [(More)](http://www.yale.edu/gsp/colonial/belgian_congo/index.html)

Then move on to [Saint-Domingue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Domingue#Establishment) - ""*Have they not hung up men with heads downward, drowned them in sacks, crucified them on planks, buried them alive, crushed them in mortars? Have they not forced them to consume faeces? And, having flayed them with the lash, have they not cast them alive to be devoured by worms, or onto anthills, or lashed them to stakes in the swamp to be devoured by mosquitoes? Have they not thrown them into boiling cauldrons of cane syrup? Have they not put men and women inside barrels studded with spikes and rolled them down mountainsides into the abyss? Have they not consigned these miserable blacks to man eating-dogs until the latter, sated by human flesh, left the mangled victims to be finished off with bayonet and poniard?*""


Then try and make a comparison. Good fucking luck.

Oh noez, you have to buy your cigarettes from someone who has a little bit darker skin than you. Who knows, maybe someone is even speaking a different language than you. Poor you. You're totally being victimized and shit.

&gt;but keeps worshiping demographic Europe's colonization by non-whites.

It's not colonization you dumb, pathetic fuck. Let's start with the definition of [colonialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism). No one is claiming sovereignty over your country. They are not exercising control over you. More than that, they're not forcibly inhabiting, they're being invited in by a democratic society.

Having lived in France and the USA, the two situations are very similar although in France it is probably worse long term due to nonacceptance of foreign culture and the huuuge difference in culture. Mexicans tend to be religious but catholicism is more similar to American culture compared to Islam. Yes Mexican music (mariachi) is horrible and they blast it in parks, but that's a superficial difference. They hate American music and we can joke about how we hate the other's music.

The field made a big impact. Wouldve been better if we had a dry field. So did the subbing off of CR7. I think a tie was deserved, as both teams had good chances. But in the end Morata headed it home to keep  hope in this league. Xabi Alonso missed a pk. Levante ends their undefeated at home season.

I agree, but dunno how much more people would start to care about politics, I bet many would still vote without being minimally informed.

&gt;You don't know this.

Democracy is all about voting for Santa Claus.

&gt;Yup, because it's only news if people disagree and protest, people who agree and have no problems don't go out of their way to demonstrate their support.

That's true, but overall the governments popularity is down due to their austerity measures. In a direct democracy system I doubt they would be able to carry on with it, but that's just my guess.

&gt;There's no 'New Game' in real life. A default wouldn't discipline anyone, it would only make it much harder for all of us without any real benefit as we'd still need the support of the rest of the EU.

I would argue that a default can act as a ""New Game"" to some extent. And not having to make interest payments, isn't that enough of a benefit? Sure we'll get no credit but that would serve to discipline us and make us live within our means, [which we already nearly are if you don't count the amount of money we spend to service our debts](http://i.imgur.com/1FbLb.png).

The soft side are the new generation of Western Europeans who are too soft, too reliant and not independent enough, and on the too harsh side there's Russia (and some Eastern European countries) that are almost borderline crazy sometimes, every man for themselves, a wild wild east so to speak.  
Basically it's a gradient that goes from pussy to crazy and I feel that most of Western Europeans are too soft, too nursed, too afraid, I mean the ones who still live with their parents at the age of 26+ and are too afraid to break any rules, it's boring, too much in-the-box-thinking, they congratulate themselves on minuscule progress too much as if even the tiniest of steps out of the comfort zone is something courageous to do. And Eastern Europeans are too hurt, broken, untrusting, harsh and trying to prove themselves too much, unpredictable in their behavior, unreadable in an eerie way that makes you not trust them, so they live in a continuous loop of a world where every man's for themselves.  
Where's the sweet-spot? At the moment I feel the divide is too large and there really isn't a good balance between these two polar opposites, but I'd reckon in 10 years the cultures will have been mixed a bit and I'd say Czech and Estonia are the best candidates for being the first perfect balance of these two extremes.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;I agree, but dunno how much more people would start to care about politics, I bet many would still vote without being minimally informed.

If people vote informed or not or if they even vote at all, that's their responsibility. Regardless, it's not up for anyone to limit the scope of democracy.

&gt;Democracy is all about voting for Santa Claus.

I don't get this.

&gt;That's true, but overall the governments popularity is down due to their austerity measures. In a direct democracy system I doubt they would be able to carry on with it, but that's just my guess.

It would be our responsibility to decide, people would campaign based on how they think we should proceed. Arguing against this because the majority might disagree is arguing against democracy.

I'm wouldn't worry about it though, think Switzerland, their much more direct democracy, the policies they implement, the welfare of their population and the efficiency of their government.

&gt;And not having to make interest payments, isn't that enough of a benefit?

That would be like deciding to go to a restaurant, not pay for the food, refuse to wash the dishes and continue to expect to be able to eat there in the future. While we're still dependent on the outside (which we'll always be, we live in a globalized world), a default isn't an option.

&gt;Sure we'll get no credit but that would serve to discipline us and make us live within our means

Geez, I also want us to live within our means, but no need to be sadistic about it, discipline would come much more easier if the responsibility laid more with the people and not with the representatives the people think don't represent them.

A default would in essence make life much much harder for us all, would disconnect us from Europe and would not teach anyone a lesson ""so that's why you shouldn't spend too much"" (just like you don't need to see your house burn down to learn to not play around with fire).",0,1352671397,null,0,false,0,c6zuozs,t3_130m3k,t1_c6zuozs,t1_c6zu1tz,null,1430379738,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

You accused me of being a Nazi apologist and supremacist just because of my nationality, in spite of me arguing in the opposite direction.

Of course things aren't that simple as Huntington describes as we have ongoing trends that are shaping the world. For example globalization and creation of global culture can be seen as expansion of the western culture, on the other hand western world itself has transformed itself hugely in the last 150 years of rapid modernization and internationalization. Another thing to note is that Russians themselves don't necessarily see themselves as Europeans, or let say it better, they feel otherness towards Europe.

Although our 'Oberstufe' might be comparable to US (Community) College Level - especially regarding its philosophy - it is still regarded as part of your secondary school, especially since most of our schools are still Hauptschule(up to grade 9), Realschule (up to grade 10) and Gymnasium (up to grade 12 or 13, depending on the province) and only a few people visit a Gymnasium/Oberstufenschule after finishing Realschule.

Also, regarding Germans starting to work early: yes and no. If you do an apprenticeship you get paid quite some money, depending on what you're doing, but there are still quite a lot of people who still live with their parents at that time and use their extra money on their cars/computers.

Generally, I'd say that our selective schooling system leads to less troubles within the schools since the early selection (that also happens due to socio-economic reasons) produces more homogenic groups. However, this is on the other hand pretty unfair for those people left behind on a Hauptschule in a troubled neighbourhood, because they of course have less chances to improve themselves.

I dunno. I think these jokes play on ethnicity as much as on nationality. Within most European countries, there are a bunch of different ethnic groups that make up the (political) nation, and one of them is the 'titular' ethnic group. I.e. you have Slovak-Slovaks as well as Hungarian-Slovaks, Jewish Slovaks, Romani Slovaks, Ruthenian Slovaks etc - and acknowledging this, even in a joke, doesn't by itself imply that one is ""first rank"" and the others are ""second rank"" (that would all depend on the content of the joke). And you don't really have the same thing in America because the idea of being ethnically ""American,"" as opposed to Italian-American, German-American etc., still feels a bit weird  (although especially in the upper South and Appalachians many people now give their ancestry as just 'American'). 

My initial point is that Jewishness can manifest itself as an ethnicity/culture as well as a religion (hence the existence of secular Jews) - it would do the culture a disservice to only define it as a religion. So I do not see the problem so much in including a Jew, alongside an Austrian and whatnot, in an 'ethnic' joke. Taking your cue, the problem would rather be that  one of them is simply labeled a ""Czech,"" making the interpretation possible that he's the only *real* Czech. So really, if you want to make the joke more politically correct, you shouldn't take the ""Jew"" out, but the ""Czech"". :-) 

But I really don't think many people would jump to that interpretation in any case. The deeply controversial Milos Zeman (the ""Czech"" in the joke) isn't exactly the most universally loved politician, whereas Fischer (the ""Jew"") and Schwarzenberg (the ""Austrian"") generally have good reputations, even if Schwarzenberg this time doesn't appear to have a chance. Last I checked, Fischer was ahead at 30%, with Zeman following at 22%, Okamura at 8% and Schwarzenberg at 7%.

1.) 
Hyper inflation?
Who said something about Hyperinflation? I haven't mentioned it at least.
Why did you mention it? To denounce my posting? 
Do you realize what inflation is? 
It is nothing but a different form of a tax. Your salary, saving will be worth less. And while corporations  will adjust prices of products, your wages wont. 
You do realize that the Euro was created as a ""hard currency""? 
A currency with a relative low inflation? 
""Increasing the money supply"" will not only lose the bit of trust the Eurozone has left. It will also screw every person with savings. 

We had some serious reforms in Germany ( I am sure you have heard of the Agenda 2010), we decided to not demand an increase of our wages for a decade! 
If I remember it correctly, the averages salaries in Greece grow more than 100% 
And you are telling me that the Germans have to pay for that decision? 
Really?

3.)
Maybe my english is not good enough for that highly difficult topic, but that wasn't my point.
I tried to say that Portugal received money form the EU (in ""not beeing a net contributer""). 
They got Money, money they don't have to pay back unlike the Marshall Plan. 
Money that should help them to catch up to other countries. 
Maybe you want to check how much Portugal got since its joining of the EU. 
It is not that I am against supporting weaker Nations, but how can you claim they did it without a Marshall Plan? 
They got something even better, EU funding! 
Do they think Germans a stupid? 
We pay quite a lot to the EU Budget, and yet sometimes it sounds that there is no help at all.
You do not ask for help in such a way.
**You will only created another UK in the middle of Europe.**


4.)

Demanding more support? 
I still don't get it, it looks that even quite a lot of the Portuguese writing on /r/europe don't get it either. 
But maybe you can explain where do you need more support?
Maybe this discussion can get a little bit productive.
If you simply demand more money, you can stick it to a place where the sun doesn't shine.

If you have some arguments where you need some ""investments"", more time or whatever I will listing to it. 

Also I never mentioned that I am against a fully unified Europe.
I said that we don't live in one. 
And you can not demand a transfer of wealth without it. 
We are not a Federation, we are a Union of different countries. 
We have different laws, especially a different ""Fiskus"" (tax authorities?) 
Boy, we do not evade taxes in Germany, because we are more responsible, better Human beings or whatever.  We don't evade them because we fear our Fiskus. 
And while we get reports about tax collectors in outer countries, who were threated to get fired because they actually tried to collect taxes, you want us to spent *our* money on other countries? 

It is not working that way. 
In a system where everyone is equal, it would be acceptable, It is not like Bremen is that different to Greece (sorry my fellow Bremer). 
But the citizens of Bremen live under the same rules like the rest of Germany. 
The citizens of Europe doesn't.
I don't see a federal republic of Europe on the Horizon and unless we have something like that, you can't demand certain things. 
Especially if it breaks existing treaties.

I did write quite a lot so I'm not sure: Didn't I write that I mean a British college and not an American college? Because that's what comes closest and is the easiest to google if somebody doesn't know what I'm talking about. Sorry for the confusion.

And where do you live? In NRW, Hauptschule is until grade 10 and it's not that hard to get a Realschulabschluss on a Hauptschule. But you're right. While I think it's better to have more than one secondary school instead of pushing everybody into one, the system certainly has it's problems.

Having to work for your money is still different. You get credit cards if you want and your parents can't tell you what to do with your money. Some people save their money, some people spend it on PCs and cars, some other people have 3k€ of debts before they're finished with the apprenticeship.

No, if anything, this proves that not-austerity was what screwed us. We had massive spending and the economic growth we were promised never came. By Portuguese standards, there's massive austerity in Eastern Europe and yet they're growing and we're not.

The lack of growth must come from more attractive business environment (a working justice system, reduced taxation, a more liberalised labour market, less bureaucracy, etc), not from the state as it can't generate any by simply taxing and spending.

Our lack of growth alongside our ever increasing debt, that's what's harming us - if the public debt to GDP ration is over 100% and the economy isn't growing, interest alone is killing us as it makes the public debt grow faster than the economy itself.

- taxes, taxes, taxes, while in Germany the max lvl of IRS starts at 500k€ in Portugal it starts at 80k€

Some points the video didn't made:

- There's some reforms Portugal needed to do and it's doing them, with lots of sacrifices for a lot of people (less social spending, etc), the unemployment skyrocketed to 16%
- Taxes raised to levels never seen before democracy
- Average salary took a 20%-30% hit in 2 years

That was obviously the point of the video, to see if Germans could pay the Portuguese debt...

The [mentor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Rebelo_de_Sousa) of this video just wanted to show some facts to Germany. Going back to May/2011 Merkel said:

""It is also important that people in countries like Greece, Spain and Portugal are not able to retire earlier than in Germany -- that everyone exerts themselves more or less equally. That is important."" 


and

""We can't have a common currency where some get lots of vacation time and others very little. That won't work in the long term.""

This two sentences have shown a deviating view of reality that added with the German pressure for Portugal to stabilize the deficit lead to the creation of the video to stop some misbeliefs that he thought were going on in Germany.

I think the video is irrelevant. Stupid or not is a ""independent"" thing and you can take some facts from it but you should't try to take any hidden message. 

The support Portugal is asking now is time, Germany/Merkel pressure for the deficit consolidation  is generating hard austerity that could be avoided. Some attenuates to that pressure could be that Portugal has followed all demands until now,  didn't asked for more money, didn't threatened to leave Euro,  didn't asked for debt pardon and is a Germany client.

This is hilarious. The west is full mosques and no go zones which will soon by under Sharia law and *we* are closer to them? Closer how? I'm romanian and I've never seen a mosque or a burka in real life. Like what are you even talking about? Closer because intolerance, what does that even mean? Muslims have a hard time with the whole tolerance thing even amongst themselves, the Shi'a–Sunni situation, treating their women like garbage, etc. Their way of life, which they are ever so feverishly eager to bring to the west, would be considered barbaric when put side by side with pretty much anything, even Russia, *even Russia*. Contrary to what you may think, most people over here *do* in fact realize that no all muslims are walking around with explosives in their underpants, probably more so than any westerner actually. *However*, due to the sheer number of such occurrences, *people just don't like them*. IMAGINE THAT! Yes, westerners, that is a thing you can totally do. This is probably hard to understand for someone who lives in the west or God forbid, the US, but eastern Europe, the baltic area and the balkan peninsula are in fact some of the safest places on Earth. Ok, the slavs are a bit squirrely in that regard but still, the tigans mostly keep the killing amongst themselves and generally speaking no one has guns so the worst thing that can happen to you is spending the night at the hospital and maybe a chipped tooth. SPEAKING OF INTOLERANCE AND STEREOTYPES, contrary to what you may have heard, these parts are very boring and uneventful. Organized crime is very low when compared to anything in the west, no one does any drugs, no serial killers, no assassinations and the people are by large phlegmatic and morose. Again, slavs *might* have something to say about that. Now compare that to the cult of Islam. You can waste your breath all you want trying to convince us that not all muslims are suicide bombing, clitoris cutting, stone throwing, acid throwing, honor killing asshats, but the fact remains that these things *never* happen over here, ever. Or at least have not happened for hundreds and hundreds of years so to an eastern european muslims look like monsters. Let's not even talk about the fact that this radical murderous ""minority"" seems to be humongous, news about muslim atrocities are commonplace. Yes, I'm aware that while the number of fundamentalists is probably in the hundreds of thousands, they still comprise a very small percentage of the global muslim population. However, that doesn't change the fact that there are still full blown legions of people who are willing to bury someone chest deep and crack their skull open with rocks because *they've been raped*. You know how many stonings happened in Romania this year? None, same as the year before and the year before that. Jesus, do I need to go on?

That is the dumbest oversimplification of the Lebanese Civil War I've ever heard (and having lived in Israel, I've heard a few). The most direct cause of the civil war was Black September in Jordan, which forced the PLO from its strongholds in Jordan into southern Lebanon. The influx of large numbers of armed Muslims destabilized the balance of power in the country, and resulted in dissatisfied Lebanese Muslims allying themselves with the PLO and the Lebanese state becoming a set of Christian militias. Israel inserted itself into the Lebanese civil war to stop the PLO from attacking northern Israel, and that just added another side to a preexisting conflict.

And Lebanon is a barely nonexistent state, half of whose territory is governed directly by an Iranian proxy terrorist organization; Egypt is run by the same military junta it has been run by for the past 60 years; Iran is run by a military/religious hybrid junta; and all the other Gulf countries have enough oil money to drown out dissent and/or export their violent types to go play jihad in Kosovo or Afghanistan or now Syria. Jordan is doing okay, but only because its political system has been terribly gerrymandered to weaken the vote of the majority-Palestinian cities and strengthen the monarchy's Bedouin base, who are a minority of the population.

Moreover, upgrading Palestine's status at the UN doesn't weaken Israel's position in negotiation at all, since nobody in the UN has ever done anything to affect the reality on the ground, which is that Israel could establish effective control over the entirety of the Palestinian territories in a matter of hours with very little resistance, and that Palestinians are deeply tied into the Israeli economy. Shutting down the border between Israel and the West Bank would inconvenience Israelis, but it would completely wreck the Palestinian economy. None of this would be affected by UN membership, so why is anyone trying to do this?

true,lebenohnestaedte,null,null,"&gt; I think the most comparable thing in English is saying ""Mr. / Ms. &lt;surname&gt;"" and adding a ""sir

This is hard to explain, because we simply don't have the concept of formal and informal addresses. Aside from using surnames and Mr. or Ms., English only reflects formality in the style of writing. For example, in a formal letter, you might start with ""Dear Mr. Smith: It has come to my attention that ..."" and in an informal letter, you might write, ""Hi, Robert (Mr. Smith), I noticed that ..."". (Sometimes people might say Mr. or Mrs. even when very familiar with the person. For example, while some university professors might allow their students to use their first names, in elementary school and high school, most students always will say ""Mr./Ms. Lastname"", but will otherwise use casual speech. Some people will also do this when speaking to their parents friends, even if they've grown up and are old enough that they could use first names.)

But all university students will always use their first names when interacting with their professors. (By this I mean, they would introduce themselves as ""Sarah Johnson"" and expect their professor to call them ""Sarah"", not ""Ms. Johnson"" -- even if though the student might always address the professor formally.) We really only use last names when necessary for identification, e.g. when turning in a paper. For example, if we were picking presentation topics, and the professor wasn't sure what our name was, we might say, ""Sarah Johnson, J-O-N..."" so the professor could find our name in the list. In a small class, we might just say, ""Sarah"". The first time I picked a Referat in Germany, I did the same thing.

true,lebenohnestaedte,null,null,"&gt; Relationship with parents: Heavily depends on the family but I think that's right. I think germany is a lot more about ""letting your kids fly"" earlier. Most teenagers start working at 16/17 and quite a few move out of home as part of that. You can drink, you (used to) are able to smoke, latest at 18 the majority of germans are entirely earning their own money and living on their own. (even if they stay around their hometown)

This is interesting to me. I grew up in Canada (so basically the same as the US) and my impression was that German kids start working later and stay at home longer. I had my first job at fourteen and haven't lived with my parents since I was 18. It's pretty normal for kids to start working in their mid-teens, and when we go to university, it's really the last time we live at home. We also don't visit home a lot on the weekends, which I've noticed a lot of German students do if they live close enough. Often people will spend summers at home for the first year or who of university, but those who start working instead usually move out fully (instead of living at home and working, even if in the same area). I don't know a ton of Erstis, but the ones I do seem pretty connected to home, in that their parents seem to be giving them money and visiting/being visited a lot and still ""parenting"" their child.

I don't perceive a huge difference between university kids in Germany and back home, but my impression is that it's less stigmatized in Germany to lean on your parents a bit. It's okay to stay at home longer, or to wait longer to get a part-time job (back home there's a bit of a sense of ""huh, must be nice having parents who still pay for all your stuff at 17!"") It's okay to live at home and work. I think it has something to do with how parents treat their children. In North America, if you're living at home, you're a child. Germans are better at letting their kids grow up to move from ""kid"" to more of a ""roommate"" role. If I lived at home, I'd never bring over my boyfriend to sleep over (unless there was a specific reason, like we were driving somewhere together very early in the morning). I have German friends living at home who can't imagine why not. They're like adults in their home, while in Canada, a kid still at home is treated pretty similarly to when they were 18 and in high school. They might have set chores (instead of generally being expected to help out), need to ask to borrow the car, have to check in with their parents if staying out late/overnight unexpectedly so parents know not to worry, and may have similar rules about boyfriends/girlfriends as when in high school (it's uncommon to let high schoolers have sleepovers with the person they're dating. Some stricter/more protective families will even have rules that the door must be open or that boyfriends/girlfriends can't come over if parents aren't home).",0,1352714730,null,0,false,0,c704gq2,t3_12wk6r,t1_c704gq2,t1_c6ysqaq,null,1430384378,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

Additionally you are marking the source (bbc) that present different description as biased. In my opinion it's not a good method to find out what really happened.

This year there were no clashes between nationalist and antifa - these groups went in separate marches (as new law about gatherings requires) and didn't meet. Even the right-wing media don't mention anything about antifa participation in riots and i am sure they would be the first to herald the next ""leftist attack on peaceful patriotic demonstration"". Violence occurred at the beginning of the march when group of football ultras attacked police. Certainly their version is that police provoked them, but hearing this explanation every time after every riots I find this hard to believe (of course one cannot exclude the possibility that these people are extremely touchy and even the view of police is enough to fire their anger).

true,chromopila,SWIT,Switzerland,"There are some points to consider:

-Most people of your age in fribourg have a quite good knowledge of english, if you learn french and meet someone who only speaks german you're still able to communicate. And vice versa

-Freiburg is quite big for a swiss city, but still it's very close to Bern(german only), which causes a big cultural and economical influence. Many people from Freiburg commute to Bern, and during the weekends many people of your age are in Bern, partying, clubbing etc, etc...


-Many people in Fribourg are bilingual, but from my experience(I served almost half a year in that area during my military service) the romands insist a little more on speaking french than the german speaking do on speaking german.


The point is that you could easily speak english, and would have only few problems, but most swiss people consider it rude if someone comes to their country and doesn't even bother to learn their language.(Source: I'm swiss and sometimes I catch myself in the act of getting a little cocky if i have to speak in english/italian/french/spanish with someone who lives in the german speaking area for years)


All points considered I tend to say that there is no 100% ""correct"" answer to your question, but I would recommend french, which probably is more usefull later in your life anyway. Have you contacted the institute? Probably they could give you some advice, if 90% of their staff speaks german, you probably better learn german...

1. In ex-USSR countries (relatively poor, but fairly tech-savvy) people often buy computers without pre-installed OS, and then they go to a local IT specialist to install pirated Windows on their computer.

2. These local IT specialists are usually nerdish guys with considerable experience. They have noticed back in mid 2000s (or even earlier) that Opera is massively faster than Firefox and offers much better security than IE. Also it has a lot of integrated features and offers good usability.

3. So when they install Windows they also install Opera and recommend user to use it instead of IE. (Often people use customized Windows distros with lots of software pre-installed, including Opera.)

4. Chrome might be a better choice now, but people already use Opera for quite a while and they are just used to it.

So, to summarize, Opera was the best option for home users around mid-2000s, ex-USSR countries were fast to adopt this best option due to how IT service is structured, and now it is just inertia.

Note that on last year's map Opera also won in Ukraine, and I know it was big in Russia from stats.

Difference between Belarus/Ukraine/Russia might be explained with different income levels: in wealthier Russia people buy new computers more often, and they are more likely to buy a laptop with pre-installed OS.

Reasoning as you do I can't find real fault with the assertion that MDMA is harmless. 

I'm probably not going to be able to have a real discussion about any of those things with a chemist, as much as I'd like to. It's certainly a compelling point to make that with the amount that's being used and the amount that are dead so far, it's not really lethal. To me though, the fact that -as you say- we don't know oral LD50 for humans is a sword that cuts both ways. It's obviously quite high or we'd have seen FAR more people dying than the UK stats agency reports. I still can't shake my concern for the effects it has on the brain with regular use, and what those changes mean for the person using the substance.

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; the economy requires financial growth to function. you are correct that an economy in recession still exists, but the point is that it is receding, and will not continue to exist if it continues to recede.

Can you provide an example of one system that will not cease to exist if it continually recedes? The point is rather that capitalism allows for economic cycles. You don't need growth in it any more than you need growth in any system. 

&gt; how do you get it? consumer disposable income. creates demand, which creates jobs, which creates more consumer spending, so more jobs, omg awesome sauce

&gt; but what if you lose it in recession? consumer spending falls. demand falls. jobs are made redundant, which further decreases consumer spending, so more jobs are lost... not awesome sauce.

That is an incredibly simplistic view of things, it is rare for all segments of an economy to contract, indeed even now there are sectors of growth which may not be taking up the whole slack but they will provide some of the growth for the future. Yes, some periods are more serious than others and require Keynesian boosts from government but again, all systems will fail in the event of extremes - ask China and Russia.

&gt; it can only work in the UP direction for a limited time (probably for some time yet if properly regulated), because the environment will run out of resources to create goods

Several hundred years and counting....but yes there is an inevitable limit as there are with all things if we accept that the Earth is a closed system. It is clearly not, and we will at some point exploit the local planetary system and beyond. The limits of space and time are not necessarily so rigid. It is not beyond the realm of reality to extend human life spans in the not too distant future. But again, regardless of the system used you will encounter these problems.

&gt; capitalism requires growth of the economy to provide a stable living environment.

eh? No it does not require growth to create a stable environment. I really don't see how you come to that conclusion.

What is stopping you or anyone else leaving this environment/country and moving elsewhere where you might be able to gain more power? I know a few people have moved to the Far East where they feel they have a better quality of life.

If you wish to stay and fight the system then fine, no arguments there and yes there is a pre-exsiting ecosystem which is not to your liking and maybe you will or will not change it. 

&gt; It takes millions of people to leverage a tiny amount of the power and influence that only a few rich entities can leverage many times over on a daily basis.

I have ideas about how socialism could be implemented but they're pretty personal and subjective. I am interested in the Cybersyn project of Stafford Beer.

I think its entirely feasible to achieve something like that under the current technological conditions. Private ownership of the means of production just has too many problems for me.",0,1352726498,null,0,false,0,c705nho,t3_12v9i1,t1_c705nho,t1_c705hm6,null,1430384962,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

But you surely have noticed how collective action is promoted within capitalist organisations while normal people have individualism promoted. Team work at work, rebellious autonomy at home. Because the former makes them strong against you, and the latter makes you weak against them (or specifically, you need to buy more stuff if you are an individual than as part of a group, and you need to buy specific differentiated products to make sure people know how cool and rebellious you are etc).

That's why I think we stick with proven (even if imperfect) planning for essential goods until we've figured out what works better. I know you'll say capitalism works better, but I genuinely think the problems with it outweighs the benefits. Only experiment with unessential production. 

I have been wondering about the idea of having some kind of credit system where for every hour of work you do you are entitled to one hour of someone elses work. Its not as simple as exchange, the product doesn't belong to anyone, but what happens is, if I want something that I don't know how to produce to be produced I can commission it that way. The product itself cannot be exchanged either partly because I wouldn't own it. If there is not enough to go around it will be rationed and I might not get first dibs which gives me an incentive to see to it that enough is produced to go around and not just enough for me. People would be able to pool their credits in order to commission more work than they can create, but no-one could sell their own credits to someone else or enable someone else to accumulate more than they themselves have worked for. Access to productive machinery would be open to all but again, if there was not enough to go around then there would be a temporary random time-limited lottery style system which would encourage people to create enough that everyone who wanted to produce (presumably because there is not enough productive machinery to produce everything people want produced) can access machinery to do so.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The good:

I am economically right-leaning, libertarian-leaning, so from this point of view I like America, as they are, how to put it, ""less social democrat"" than us. I like the spirit of entrepreneurship and all. I also like me some social-cultural conservatism, although American so-cons take it too far, but we are taking it too little, so there. I really hate that everybody in Europe seems to be a dreamy, utopian liberal who thinks violence is never the answer. I like how American foreign or military policy is more realistic, accepting that the last word is usually violence if you are dealing with uncivilized people.

The bad:

Frankly America looks like a low-trust society. Example. I was asking for advice from Reddit when buying a co-op apartment in Austria. It is extremely common in Austria: you pay 25% of the apartment cost, 25% is paid by the government, you pay a low rent for the rest. I was asking people on Reddit if they think it is a bad idea. American Redditors were like ""Ohmigod really check if it is not a scam!"" No. Why would it be a scam? It is done by the largest, most traditional companies and the government together. Why would a co-op that already has two dozen apartment houses be a scam? Then others say: ""Really check the contract, maybe there is a clause that if you miss 1 month payment you may lose all your investment, it happened in America."" I checked the contract. Totally had nothing like that in it, the only thing it said is that if you don't pay and we have to sue you, you have to pay the costs of the lawsuit. I asked them what happens if I don't pay. They just looked funny. Their whole logic was different than this kind of low-trust logic, right? Their logic is like you wanna live here, so we assume you gonna pay. If you are in some kind of short-time financial difficulties, you tell us, we make a compromise. If you don't pay for a long time, you are out and get your money back, unpaid months deducted + the late payment interest fees defined in law. So she was like, what are you even asking, the whole thing is just common sense? And indeed it was. Why would be anything special about paying a monthly rent? These things had good common sense compromise solutions long, long ago.

This is the spirit in Europe or at least Austria that is apparently, according to Reddit missing in America. **This very idea that when we deal with each other, we make a compromise, we get a common sense solution that makes everybody happy, and we get on with our lives. According to Reddit at least in America everybody wants to take 100% advantage for himself in every situation and fuck the other guy. I don't know whether to believe it but it sounds weird.**

Another thing. Although many regulations are strict here, I don't really see that spirit here that according to Reddit America has, namely that corporate bosses are inhuman profit monsters and would screw anyone and anything for money. It is here often more like, there is a ""proper"" way for everything. Proper way to treat the environment, proper way to treat employees. They just do it because it is proper. Not necessarily because improper ways are not allowed, although, usually, they are not allowed. There is not this spirit that there is this regulation gap, come exploit it for $$$ because devil take anything but money. This partialy why I am economically right-leaning, I don't think it is necessary to regulate stuff so hard over here.",0,1352728368,null,0,1352728710,0,c705xwg,t3_1311u3,t1_c705xwg,t3_1311u3,null,1430385094,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Also without ownership and the respective rights it is hard(er?) to determine somethings value. The whole purpose of the market mechanism is to determine a price for something based on how different people value things. Clearly this is imperfect in practice but it generally works.

I appreciate you're thinking on your feet but the system you've described sounds incredibly complicated and assumes other forces act as mediators which be defintion will give them a lot of power and hence open to corruption. We each value things differently, for example if I wanted to go on a cruise but the system only created enough places for 5 slots and it wasn't my turn/ration then I'd be gutted whereas someone who was indifferent would use it but not enjoy it as much.

I get this, and it is a problem, its just as much a problem in capitalism though. The law itself is a mediator of property rights for instance, but that gives the police, the government etc the opportunity for corruption. The only way to deal with it, and it's imperfect, is checks and balances. They can be built into any kind of system.

I figure that any system of rationing for a specific product you'd sign up for it, it wouldn't be ""everyone gets a chance at having a cruise even if they don't want one"". All the people who sign up obviously want to go on a cruise - and if the system worked the way you describe we'd probably heap disapproval on people who sign up for scarce things they don't particularly want which would keep most people in check.

Also this is just as much a problem in our system except it's whether someone has the pre-existing funds not whether they ""won"" this lottery that decides if they are the one on the boat.

Your profit is the existence of the thing you want, the more of them there are the more likely it is you get to use it as and when you want. To me that seems a strong motivator. Its biggest difficulty is dealing with very scarce things that are also highly sought after (because your chance at getting to use it is very low) - but the number of people buying lottery tickets makes me feel this won't prevent people trying :P

As for the lost opportunity issue, its not really different to in capitalism. I might come up with an awesome idea but if someone isn't willing to invest then it will never go anywhere.

I'm originally from Romania but I have been living in the US since I was 2 years old (I'm 26 now) and I don't *hate* America but I dislike it for many reasons and I can't wait to get the fuck out. 

I don't like that America is so large that it makes travel very difficult and expensive. Also, there are no low-budget airlines like there are in Europe that would help make travel cheaper. I like to travel dammit. America is also so separated from the rest of the westernized world (with the exception of Canada) so that also makes it difficult and more expensive to travel. 

That separation from the western world brings me to my next point of isolation. America is kind of isolated ""in its own little world"" and that has created this superiority complex that many Americans have. ""We're the best country in the world, god bless America, I hate those European commie bastards, dammit this is 'Merica!"" It's gotten to the point that it's painful to watch someone with these ideals. 

Another thing I hate is the military spending. Yes, America is a bigger country with a lot of people so you definitely need a military but I think ours is far too large and we spend FAR too much money on it. 

I hate that, in general, healthy food is more expensive than junk food (this could be true of other countries but I'm obviously focusing on America). 

I really wish having a car was more optional rather than pretty much mandatory. There are very few cities in the US where you don't need a car and can still get around efficiently with public transportation. If I want to go to a cafe, first I have to find one (especially if you don't live in the very center of a city) then I have to drive 15 minutes to get to it. 

The stereotype that Americans are dumb isn't entirely untrue. Yes it's a stereotype so it certainly does not apply to everyone but a ""dumb American"" isn't hard to find. I once convinced a girl that Romania was next to Arizona and she believed me. 

I am $30,000 in debt due to the way universities work in America. We pay for them, and we pay a lot. Yes we can get government loans but I still have to pay that back, plus interest.

Contenu éditorial[modifier]
Le quotidien traite d'économie, de finance et d'actualité nationale, régionale et internationale. Il aborde principalement les secteurs de l'industrie, des services, des hautes technologies, des médias, des pays émergents et du management.
Concernant la Finance, qui constitue l'ADN du quotidien depuis sa création, elle reste au cœur du débat avec la traditionnelle cote bien sûr, mais également des articles, des enquêtes et des focus sur des valeurs, des marchés… pour être utile autant aux professionnels agissant directement sur les marchés financiers qu'aux particuliers disposant d'un patrimoine.
La Tribune a développé sur son site web articles, flash d'informations et reportages vidéos, mais aussi des fonctionnalités permettant une bonne gestion de ses investissements (cotations, liens…), des canaux dédiés aux professionnels (canal CGP), des diaporamas pour suivre l'actualité en un clin d'œil, des blogs…",0,1352730589,null,0,1352731009,0,c706bt3,t3_131wre,t1_c706bt3,t3_131wre,null,1430385259,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

My thoughts on the idea so far are:

* Cost of vandal-proof boxes is high. They need to be firmly fixed (concreted?) into the ground. Planning permission is necessary for this or to attach them to other existing structures.
* How to take money from the people using them (token amounts like €1 / 50c) without attracting greater risk of vandalism to try breaking in to the money deposit area. CCTV?
* Cost of staffing money management (collection etc) &amp; cost of setup vs revenue generated.
* Number of locker banks required to make the scheme useful? (probably very large. 1x bank of 20-50 lockers per 200m I would say) Could make setup costs very high.
* Planning permission, the cost of setting up the business as a legal entity, the amount of paperwork of it all... maybe too much.
* Opportunity of sponsorship! Both sides of the locker banks (if free standing) could be advertised on.
* High flying balloon / flag or something to show where the nearest / numbered locker is.

This is why for example general elections are held in the UK if, and only if, the Queen dissolves Parliament. You may argue that these powers are not being abused, but you may think differently if you're an Australian who lived in 1975, when the Governor-General (the delegate of the Crown to Australia) removed a democratically elected government from power.

From the website:

""They will gain easier access to the labour market if they can produce a binding job offer with a gross annual salary of at least 44,800 euros. For skilled workers in the fields of mathematics, IT, the natural sciences and engineering as well as for doctors, the threshold is set at just under 35,000 euros.""

But even more interesting is this part:

""In addition, professionals can apply for a visa without producing a binding job offer; once issued, this visa will entitle its holder to stay in Germany for up to six months to seek employment.""

Especially if you qualify for the 35k, it might be a good thing to apply for the visa, as you should be able to earn it with a decent job, even at entry level. 

I'd also recommend to take a look at the ""Make it in Germany"" Website (http://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/home/), it is sponsored by the  federal government to help people move here.

Because if they are that motivated to manifest thier ideas I don't see why not. Why take that freedom away from them?

No it is not unfair at all. It may be harder for those on minimum wage jobs to save to start thier own business and I appreciate that it would be very difficult to achieve but it is far from impossible if you are so motivated.

I would love to get one and earn some money by being a teaching assistant (am a doctoral student). However, I refuse to play the victim game and claim that I am being terribly discriminated on based on ""race"", as some of my friends here do. I guess ethnic Bulgarians are of the same race as British people (white). But then again this policy is towards Bulgarian citizens which include ethnically Turkish and Roma people among others. Maybe some Bulgarian citizens of Anglo-Saxon decent are discriminated against too. It's clearly not about race or ethnicity, it's just politics. We, Bulgarians, regardless of race or ethnicity, ARE poorer and we WILL take your jobs, don't make any mistake about it.

This is, for the time being, a very sensible policy as far as British interests are concerned. I am not complaining, because I can still get a job after graduating. It's just a little harder for me because I need to be highly qualified. I would also support similar immigration laws in my country.

As I said, bootstrap a company i.e. start small and build on it. It make time more time but it is doable. It is not easy I agree but neither is it impossible.

So you're reducing everything to a popularity contest now? Not all useful ideas were popular, in fact some very hurtful ideas were popular....so not sure how that solves anything. 

&gt; If a project relies entirely on one individual who doesn't even value the project particularly, what is so bad about it failing.

Contrived I know but it highlights why it might be a bad thing....5 people come together to build a life-saving machine. For whatever reason the engineer and the marketing person fall out. So much so that the engineer withdraws his labour and his skillset is highly specialised. Project now risks failure. Maybe the engineer was only interested because of a particular technical challenge whereas the marketing persons child depended on it. There you have two valid and different motivations. 

EDIT: Should there not be a replacement engineer available or willing then the project is dead. However, under another system the project lead/owner could be to train someone to gain those skills to work for them.

&gt; Why is it better to have a system where instead you say to that person ""if you don't support my project you'll lose your income and be evicted!""?

Because the nature of capitalism (or free markets) is such that ideas which may not be popular can happen and if life is simply a popularity contest then lets just all give up and go on XFactor.

I think one of the issues is that many in the UK would perceive being 'European' as also being pro-Federal Europe. Many leaders of Continental European countries do to seem to talk about a Federal Europe in terms that make it seem predestined, obvious and morally right. There's plenty of people on /r/europe who seem to agree with that as well.

Many in the UK (or maybe it's a mainly English thing) do not share that ideal and thinking that all of 'the Continent' shares in that belief would therefore deduce that we're not European in anything but a simple geographical sense.

I do think you underestimate the isolating aspects of the channel though.

There's two aspects here that we should distinguish between:

1. On one hand, calling people ""sissies"" is extremely stupid at best and harmful at worst. How is it harmful? Because it implies that there's something negative about being feminine, particularly if you're male. [And because social constructivism is a thing](http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-ways-you-dont-realize-movies-are-controlling-your-brain/). How you talk about things, especially in a social context, impacts how you think about things, subsequently impacting how you act and react toward things, in this case other people. In essence, the more you mentally connect effeminate behavior with weakness or shamefulness, the more likely you are to actually dislike people who display that behavior, regardless of their actions. This is literally how wars are started, and it's how gay people and other minorities are *still* in danger of being assaulted to this day.

2. On the other hand: Why, exactly, do you feel that you need arguments beyond what's given to abstain from judging people you don't know? Someone else, a person, a human being, is impacted by your generalisations and insults, and you should require nothing more than a request that you refrain from insulting people you don't know. But no, it's not unusual in this miserable neckbeard culture to see people vehemently defending their ""right"" to say whatever they want, regardless of consequences, as long as they're safely behind internet-granted anonymity. It's something entirely different when you have to actually face someone — for some reason, people start caring about who they hurt.

Since moats that are filled with water are way better you start digging a channel from the water your moat and let it fill with water.

I do think increased consolidation in the face of a shrinking world and an erosion of what was for a very long time the privileged European (and later Western) position as the nexus of global power and wealth is important. 

Because in a world where nations with more territory and population (and soon, more wealth) are growing more assertive a country like the Netherlands whose population is less than a lot of cities will have very little chance of pushing its point of view or system of values. All things being equal I'd rather make the full and conscious decision to surrender or share sovereignty with other nations in a European project where I can at least vote, as opposed to remaining independent under the nominal guise of independence but the government taking its marching orders from a place it has far less input in than Brussels. And as much as the UK's attitude sometimes annoys the absolute piss out of me, I think I'd prefer an Europe with the UK in it, because you're all still a part of our shared history and because I think the UK has a better chance of pushing its interests in what is -more or less- a collection of equals, than run the risk being dictated to in a decidedly unequal partnership.

Also, lest we forget, at some point a river like the Rhine or a mountain chain like the Alps or Pyrenees was for all intents and purposes an equally immutable border as the Channel is.

&gt; Lastly, why do we always focus on competitiveness? Businesspeople talk endlessly about it but it is a less useful concept on a macroeconomic scale. It conflates two concepts: macroeconomic competitiveness, as expressed by the real exchange rate, and total factor productivity, or TFP, a proxy for a country’s technological dynamism. A cut in unit labour costs is only a gain if you achieve it but nobody else does. Once you advocate it as a policy for everyone in the eurozone, you end up in a zero-sum game. **We cannot all devalue at the same time. If we are saying that the eurozone should reduce unit labour costs to the level of Germany, why do we think that Germany will not do the same?**

The question is not of devaluing relative  the Eurozone, but in devaluing relative to the rest of the world. Say there's a Greek worker in a Greek chemical factory, and a German worker in a German chemical factory, who are competing to export their product to a non-European country, say Brazil, Egypt or Qatar. [Thirty years ago the Greek worker's wages were ten times lower than the German worker, twenty years ago they were 50% lower, ten years ago they were 20% lower, and in 2010 they were slightly higher](http://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/image0013.png). And for a German worker you could substitute in anyone else from the developed world outside the Eurozone, say the USA or Australia. 

That doesn't necessarily mean that the Greek worker was that much poorer than the other worker in terms of being able to buy every-day goods, because many goods would have come from within the country, but they were able to do labour for third-party countries at far lower cost. Does this represent a sustainable change, that Greek industry has no competitive advantage of lower costs against German industry, but must outcompete them directly? If you were deciding to build a chemical factory somewhere, which country would you choose? Especially given the widely cited corruption within Greece. It's not about devaluing to compete with China, it's about Greece giving itself an advantage over other, similarly prosperous countries, and leveraging its advantages in education, infrastructure, proximity to market, and natural environment.

But also over about 300 years of being in Ulster the planters were in many places becoming integrated as both Presbyterians and Catholics were treated as second class citizens.

The beginnings of Irish republicanism in the late 1700's with support from the French was a mix from the Catholic and Presbyterian communities, as both had much to gain from independence. (Many Scots-Irish were involved in the republican revolution in America in the 1780's.)

There were even parts of Ulster where Presbyterians spoke Irish like the natives and identified as Irish rather than Scottish. However, one the rebellion of 1798 actually happened it broke down into extreme sectarian violence. It is fairly likely that the Anglican ruling class intentionally sowed further seeds of mistrust within the communities to get their own wishes.

It's hard to really explain such a complex situation that needs to be looked at over all its 400 years to fully understand it. Essentially, although the acts of violence were committed in the name of religion and ethnicity, much of the religious and ethnic conflict was originally stirred up to suit the needs of the ruling class. 

It is also worth note that  at the time of the modern beginnings of the Northern Ireland situation in 1912, Belfast was the biggest dockyard in the world and the loss of such an important industrialised city to a new autonomous region would not have suited the local businessmen running the city. Who then used religion to spur up the protestant working class with slogans such as ""Home Rule is Rome Rule"" and such.

Russians are not european. European culture and politics are based on negotiation and compromise, russian culture and politics is based on intimidation, threats and force. Russians have two modes of thinking - they are either the agressive, bullying top dog, or the low servile cur. Nothing in between. Most of the bad character problems (agression, beurocracy, corruption) we have in eastern europe is because of russian influence.

Genderqueer people are just attention whores. As long as the consent is mutual, fuck what you want, be with whom you like. Just stop explaining to everyone how non-binary and/or confused you are, and that I should be to.  

Britain is doomed as a nation in the next few generations. The old generation is excelent and inteligent, but the british youth are just lazy, talentless, stupid and entitled drunks/whores. Most of the imigrants to UK from the middle east are just bigoted, backward, welfare queens, that have never done an honest days work.

Having a welfare state should be a mark of shame. It' means that in your country people are reduced to the status of panhandlers, and like children are incapable of taking care of themselves. 

Non istitutionalisd racism is a non issue. Hate and love who you want (that is called freedom i believe). Hire and fire who you like. Call anyone by the names you like, but be ready to face the consequences (getting punched in the face for insulting someone for example). Problems with racism start when it is put in to law (i.e. black people must ride at the back of the bus, if they don't - cops.).

Self defence should be an universal right - if someone tries to use foce on me or my family and friends I should be permited to and justified if I end the agressors life with any tools or means I have.

• The Greek ‘slave mentality’ which basically means that the less work an employee accomplishes in one day, the better he feels about himself.

• Something the Greeks call ‘klopyright’, a made up word which combines the Greek word ‘klepto’ which means ‘steal’, with the word, ‘copyright’. It signifies that stealing something, whether it’s someone else’s idea, or even monies obtained from government or other big institutions through false claims of eligibility or need, is actually a clever and praiseworthy business practice.

• The conviction that foreigners, Americans in particular, are naive, and are therefore easy to fool and deserving of being tricked.

And no, I certainly don't share that opinion. Being a part of the Eurozone does mean there is surrendering of sovereignty in the sphere of monetary policy, but that impact to sovereignty is far less than those nations that use the Euro without a seat at the table. Or for that matter, that use the Dollar. Doubly puzzling is the shift in the tone of debate from sovereignty to ""good for you, switching to a currency that doesnt get devalued every five minutes"". And maybe there's a grain of truth to that, just as there is truth in the fact that getting right down to it, monetary policy can best be set right down to the city level. After all, economically depressed areas within a country might not need the inflation-curbing interest rates that the well-off parts are keen on. In any event, through paying into and being invested in the structure of the Euro we are able to push our interests in some way. Certainly more than the 16 unofficial users of the US dollar are able to advance their position with the Federal Reserve.

 I've been on my local consulate's site many, many times, signed up for a profile to make an appointment and have been there once and had them look over some paperwork.

 Every consulate is different but look online for a .pdf file going through jure sanguinis requirements, etc. Make sure you know what you need. Order EVERYTHING in duplicates. ensure that all documents litteraly have not ONE letter misspelled, out of place, missing, dates wrong, etc. Everything from the bloodline you are claiming down must be perfect and translated.
 The US documents can all be ordered online regardless of state. Then they need to be sent in for the Apostille. Then they get translated into Italian, then they get sent back out to the states respective Consulate for a stamp. (any documents from the state you live in does not need that stamp, they'll do it in the office) Its been about a years process and while it has been work, its totally worth it so far.

Now that they have the basics right, they screw up at the new stuff like using only  proprietary formats for audio and video, and also DO NOT TRACK.

The more specific problem with this is that it will probably have the opposite of the desired effect. DO NOT TRACK does nothing to prevent advertisers from tracking you, it just asks them not to. It was becoming an accepted thing by many advertisers until it was turned on by default in the most used browser. Now they have a good reason why not to respect DO NOT TRACK and some have already retracted their support.

This went as far as ignoring a famine that between malnutrition and immigration which reduced Ireland's population by almost 50% in the space of around two decades.

Given this lack of concern for the wellbeing of the Irish people as whole, it wasn't surprising that poor Irish people would join the British army given that they had practically other choice. 

In fact, that made perfect sense, it kept a steady flow of young Irishmen manning the ranks who not being English, were more than expendable.

This only means you CAN but not that you MUST get insured with a private insurer. There are certain advantages and disadvantages, when an agency settles you in they should be able to give you a good overview about the matter. Generally insurance here works a bit differently and is probably better value per money than in the US but as that depends heavily on your employer in the US I can't say much more about it. 60k is a pretty good salary to live on, even in Munich which is one of the most expensive cities in the country. However, it's certainly cheaper than NYC, especially when it comes to decent apartments. You should also be aware that depending on how much overtime the company expects you might have to do some unpaid hours to get your projects done for a deadline and such, it's generally up to the company how they handle overtime gratification, direct extra pay is not that common in high salary jobs which generally mean individual contracts instead of tarifs. The typical overtime bonus is 25% extra per hour but I'm not at all sure about taxation. The dollar being rather weak in comparison to the euro also means that you'll be able to pay off your debt well as we're currently hovering above 1,25$ per 1€.

As for the experience: being an expatriate means a nice boost to your CV but you probably know that. It also means that you will be far away from your loved ones and them being currently unemployed means that you'll have to be the one to take trips back home from time to time and those don't come very cheap. It's usually a four figure trip even with cheap flight offers and takes a whole day which comes out of your holiday. It might still be worth it though, not just because the money can still compare. Decent groceries and other basic living expenses are rather cheap compared to basically any other nation so you have more freedom to do with your funds as you please. Munich has a rich history and if you really want to explore it and the rest of Germany you can do so a lot, even on a budget. Distances are short compared to the US and although a car would be advantageous you can do fine with public transportation. This is all assuming you want to pay off the debt so you won't be as ""rich"" as a typical German with 60k/year. NYC is definitely another caliber of a city compared to Munich but size and attention aren't everything. How much you can enjoy it depends on how much German you speak, it's possible to get by with English but German helps a ton.

The biggest thing in my opinion is the difference in working hours. If they don't expect a lot of overtime in Germany your salary per hour gets so much better it would be insane to turn it down. Having time is precious and with a probably shorter commute to work you'll have enough to sleep enough, do sports, find friends, go out and travel around on the weekends with all the housework done. I can't stress enough how much this has improved the lives of anybody I talked to who did this. Now for you this would mean changing the culture you live in but that's an opportunity at the same time. I would not pass up the offer as long as I'm not bound to a significant other.

Dazu kommen imho auch noch spezifisch ostdeutsche Probleme, wie die Grenzöffnung zu Polen in 2007. Da gibts halt Gegenden, in denen z.B. die Autodiebstähle seither um 300 oder gar 400 Prozent zugelegt haben. Entsprechend schlecht sind die Leute auf ""die Ausländer"" zu sprechen. 

Nicht zu vergessen, dass viele ~~gut~~ höher gebildete Menschen aus ökonomischen Gründen den Osten in Richtung Westen verlassen haben. Das heißt nicht, dass im Osten nur Dumpfbacken  unterwegs sind, aber wenn der Anteil an Leuten mit höherer Schulbildung sinkt, dann gibts da ""automatisch"" auch mehr Rechtsextreme.

Was die Frage nach der antifaschistischen Vergangenheit angeht, gibts sicherlich mehrere Erklärungen. Eine davon ist, dass durch den Zusammenbruch der DDR und des repressiven SED-Regimes ein Machtvakuum entstanden ist, welches rechtsextremen Einstellungen Vorschub geleistet hat. Anders gesagt: In der Nachwendezeit war es für alle möglichen Ideologien und Ideologen recht einfach, sich im  Osten einzunisten.

Yes, Germany should leave unless it can accommodate itself to transferring up to 5% of GDP (Edward Chancellor says 3.6%), to its poorer 'family' year-on-year, in perpetuity.

Federal US taxation is ~25% of GDP and the variation in spending levels between rich and poor states is ~5% of GDP, so a variation of roughly 20% of federal spending.

How big a budget would the EU need to be able to slosh around 5% of combined GDP into the poor regions (bearing in mind the current budget is only 1% (and heavily constrained by CAP payments)?

The other point is that americans accept this, they are all american, whereas we are rapidly finding out just how german the germans are, and finnish the finns are, when it comes to firehosing cash at nations they consider to be essentially delinquent!

In the UK this 'sloshing' occurs in the form of:

1. national pay-bargaining which benefits poorer regions (teachers, nurses, etc)

2. national social benefits more generous than poorer regions could afford alone (eg.housing benefit in glasgow)

3. targeted regional development grants/discounts to encourage business growth (objective 1 EU/WEFO funds)

4. additional infrastructure spending to support the local economy (the mainland-skye bridge)

5. operating national services hubs from depressed regions to boost wages (DVLA in swansea, etc)

&gt; This only means you CAN but not that you MUST get insured with a private insurer.

Now, we only have to explain to OP what the difference is, and that's complicated. Private insurers have many different plans, co-pay options, and so on. They can be significantly cheaper if you're young, but get more expensive as you grow older and you can't just switch to the public one later. It's a pretty big decision, and things like whether or not you plan on having kids and expect the mother to be publicly insured (i.e, have the kids on her plan), or if you intend to retire in Germany (which would mean expensive private insurance throughout retirement), affect the calculation. Then there's the big unknown how the health insurance system will develop by the time the higher rates would hit, health care expenses are pretty high so it's possible that there will be a big reform in the next decades.   
However, given OP's already high salary, unknown future in the country, and of course the additional expenses for the student loan right now, I'd go private.

The actual cause of it is of course not racial, but 95% of the time people make statements that others perceive as racist they do not actually claim it has a racial cause, they merely notice and generalize it. The problem is that many liberals attack negative statements about ethnic groups even when the person did not say it has a racial cause and did not say he does not accept social explanations. 

In other words, the problem that gets attacked when calling someone racist is not merely overgeneralization, but many liberals find it wrong to ""blame the victim"" i.e. to criticise those groups whose bad behavior is actually caused by the oppression by the majority. The problem with it is that it completely confuses social and individual sphares, it is perfectly OK to be mad at a certain group of people who did bad things to me individually even when in some vague social sense it is because my group oppresses theirs.

To the OP: Unless you have really big personal objections of going to Germany or Europe, do it. Don't just look at the money or your loan. You will eventually pay it off and never think of it again. But if you don't take this chance, you might be sorry for the rest of your life. Simply because it's an opportunity only very few people get. And even if it doesn't work out, you will always have the chance to go back. You're also not talking about a GF or wife. If you are alone that's also good, because you don't have to bring someone along. Later when you have family, your wife might have a job, your kids go to school. It will be much harder to do something like this.

**Bamberg:**
* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique german medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  
*The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.
*Right next to the Cathedral, there is the ""Alte Hofhaltung"" where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers
*The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""
* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above 
* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006.
* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;hl=de&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=18)  as you'll have a superb view over Bamberg and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food. 
*Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;num=30&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=de&amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;t=h&amp;z=17)
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right and enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg


**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.
* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.
* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)
* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.
*Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe
*[Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 
*[Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp; culture. But i believe this would be a little bit too much ;)
*[Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing

**Würzburg:**
*[Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) 
*[Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)

Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live, and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany.

The remnants of a left-wing revolution, the cronyism and nepotism that have been prevalent for decades and the overall disinterest with these matters of politics in our society, perhaps?

You're right, it's most unfortunate, but whenever you try to improve things, for example, when you try to liberalise the market, groups like the the communists, the labour unions, the business unions and entrepreneurs always seem to make an unholy coalition and try to avoid it at all costs - some to further their goals of an inefficient nanny-state so they have higher chances at power, others to keep the workers they already represent employed at the expense of those who are still unemployed and therefore unaffiliated to any labour unions and others who simply want to keep competition away from the market and benefit from it being more unappealing for others to start a business or hiring new personal.

This cycle will eventually have to break, some say it already is with all these problems, but we'll have to wait and see if we learn from these mistakes or if history will repeat itself..",0,1352801712,null,0,false,0,c70ndmi,t3_133seo,t1_c70ndmi,t1_c70naht,null,1430393449,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"With transfer payments or with devaluation you will only mask the underlying problem that has caused the balance of payment crisis, and that is China and globalization. 

Chinese producers have extended and taken over many markets that have been previously been in the hands of southern European manufacturers, ranging from textiles to low cost mass manufactured items. Chinese appetite for oil also has increased market prices which have largely been felt in economies whose power production largely relies on imported fossil fuels.

Of course more prosperous Eurozone countries could establish transfer union, but like I said before, that would only mask problems, worst it would remove impetus from these countries to seek solutions to their problems. 

For example remedies to problems I mentioned before are things like...

* Liberalization and cutting down of legislation to foster growth of new ventures and start ups. This in time will enable creation of new growth industries to match losses that Chinese industries have created.
* Giving permits to build new non-fossil based power generation, there aren't for example no nuclear plants in Greece and Portugal.

Another issue is that transfer payments would be easily constructed by not only politicians, but the markets that southern countries are for ever lost cases.
