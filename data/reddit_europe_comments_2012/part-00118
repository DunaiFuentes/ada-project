The whole point of my post was that you can't say ""overall"" and then compare the US to the likes of Switzerland, a country whom even Germany complains only allows their top students to take the standard tests which these rankings come from. Yes, there are many European countries that do better when compared to individual states but there's also a lot of individual states that do better than many European countries. I guarantee you that all of the top performing countries in those rankings are doing something to skew their results like not giving the test to all students or teaching to the tests. Do you really think rural China has such a high educational system when they can barely feed themselves and average something like an 8th grade level?

The biggest factor that determines educational success is how much money the parents make. I'd bet its the social safety nets in Europe that make more difference, with a higher quality of life for the poor their children will have a better chance at succeeding.

I'm a guy it was less a problem, but I could totally understand the feeling.  A few, but a small minority, of the people I talked too gave off a creepy vibe.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Well, it must take some mental gymnastics to come to that conclusion. 

Where there have been referendums on the ""treaties"" the EU has drawn up, the answer has frequently been ""no"". However, national governments have simply been told by the EU that this is the ""wrong"" answer, and to come up with the right one. Many of the treaties the constituent EU nations have signed up for have no popular support in the nations that now have them as law. Indeed, ""populism"", meaning doing what the electorate actually wants, is a dirty word within the governing bodies of the EU. That is a big problem, and attempting to get around it by claiming that democratically elected governments (which the EU has repeatedly demonstrated it can remove at will, which is surely a motive for governmental cooperation) are behind it is a bit of a cop out. 

As a trading block, the EU is great, but this rush toward federal integration, steamrollering any and all objections along way, replacing uncooperative governments, forcing cooperation through threats, ignoring referendum results, will all eventually achieve the opposite of what the EU set out to do. As it stands it *is* very much a bureaucratic institution.

So, yes, I stand by my original statement. The EU, as it stands now, is an institution created by bureaucrats, without democratic mandate, and will ultimately fail unless it changes, and I see no sign of change.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"It does seem to me to be an odd policy, that EU students must be treated like nationals.  It's a big incentive to introduce tuition fees on a national level*, or if governments wish to keep domestic education free, to find other ways of discouraging European students. You say that Scotland is benefiting from English tuition fee rises, and they'll certainly attract a lot more European students, but these are going to be students who the Scottish government is paying to educate.

I'd prefer a voucher-style system, where students can take a percentage of the funding which they would be provided in their home nation, and then top up towards the fee charged in the country of study. An EU student should arrive with funding that at least meets the costs of the course, so they're not being subsidized by taxpayers in the destination country.

*Edit: It was never mentioned, but I wouldn't be surprised if this was part of the private rationale for the tuition fee rise in England, because England tends to attract more students than it sends out.

Edit: Someone in a parallel thread in r/uk posted [this link](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17156978), which is quite interesting:

&gt; There has been a 6% rise in the number of European Union students applying to Scotland's universities this autumn.

At least in Germany, state pays for schooling, (half time, all schooling is free in Germany), and the employer pays the wage (reduced, but increasing with time). With a finished degree you can then work anywhere, at full wage, no questions asked. 

There's no limit on graduates per year, and the usual time it takes is two (reduced) to three (regular) years. You learn *a lot* there, more than you can imagine without actually pursuing that profession. Mason, Butcher, Electrician, insurance clerk, you name it. Degrees aren't required by law everywhere (you don't want unprofessional electricians running around messing stuff up, with waiters, it doesn't matter that much, but if you get a degree as ""waiter"" (actually: restaurant specialist) you can run the whole place), but strongly recommended, and influence pay.

The same thing happens in China. Work that could be easily done with heavy machinery are instead done by hundreds of cheap workers.

&gt; And the idea that people should work less so that everyone can work is terrible. Division of labour and specialisation improves efficiency and more importantly increases productivity, which is of prime importance in such a staple industry as agriculture considering that world population is increasing and we are already stretched thin to provide enough food for everyone (not to say that this is the only reason there is hunger in the world).

In Spain people are struggling to stay alive because they can't make money anymore. What we're seeing in Spain and Greece is radical simplification of economic relationships. This also happened in the US during the Great Depression. It might not make sense in your book but it does make sense when improving productivity is no longer an option.

Everyone still need to contribute to society in one way or another, else it will fail both on a moral and structural sense.  The survival of the fittest system sound very similar to what the Nazi idea where, with all the race traits and applying Darwinism way to simply. This idea you propose implies if you're disabled, you're an economic drain to society, so there fore we should exterminated or excluded. 

People, if educated towards self education as opposed toward the work market will always attempt to improve their skill set/lifes as it makes people feel good about them selfs. This can be proven by the behaviour of children who have no had no influence of money or competition, but want to be creative and inquisitive just for fun. 

But to compare hunter gather behaviour to a system which has existed for merely 300 years is a wholly inaccurate assumption, because you would be stating that during feudal (and before) times that people didn't achieve any creative or inspiration advancements, which is clearly wrong.  

Your ideas would be more acceptable if it was survival of the fittest applied directly to the natural order, but you're implying that allowing a small minority of people to dictate this survival idea is somehow natural, which isn't. These higher classes individuals don't have to perform any survival tactics as they're privileged and pay or get paid by others to sustain their position.

The access to property, jobs and means of production are quite similar in each of these systems, given that they share deep philosophical roots and the same overall goal.

Really, unless we are talking governance, we can use any of these terms to describe the workers seizing the means of production to create an egalitarian system. In this case, though, given that the governance system is ad-hoc and has little in the way of authority, we could describe it as anarcho-syndicalist.

The role of the mayor is up for debate, however. Depending on how integrated and essential he is for internal governance, this may tip the scales towards either socialism or a form of communism.

They have completely different goals (FH is focused on industry near education and the university on theory and research) and a Master made on a FH allows you to get your PhD as well as the Bachelor allows you to make a Master at a university. While you probably will never see a resistor if you study electronic engineering at a university, they probably throw that stuff at you after a week on a FH. What you did is like comparing a Mathematics degree with a Computer Science degree. Both related but totally different direction (one is proving and studying math while the other one is using math as a tool for their subject). 

Also, on average, FH and university degrees don't get paid different. Of course they are always people who think that university students are all ""Fachidioten"" and some other people think FH students have a shitty degree. But so people thought about diplomas and Master degrees as well. The FH degree was a lot less compared to the university before it got changed to Bachelor and Master but the switch between a FH and university is a lot easier today.

Not to mention that you don't build a well build home even with 150,000 USd. In Finland materials for well build small 100sqm2 home will cost 132,000Eur, total cost with work included will be near 287,000Eur and that doesn't include land. The reason why you want your house to be well build is because it lasts longer, is more energy efficient, offer more amenities.

I disagree on that one, because these safety nets were designed to catch people when they have problems - lose their job, get sick, etc. in germany, 10 percent of the people have no perspective and will be dependent on welfare all their lives, because they have no chance on the regular labour market, or the jobs they could do are so badly paid that it is better for them to get welfare. that does not sound like a well designed system imho",0,1346699350,null,0,false,0,c62wqsv,t3_z9vrw,t1_c62wqsv,t1_c62w79r,null,1429807597,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Geothermal heat pumps and wind/solar/thermal electricity generation are though. And they are rapidly becoming more efficient and cost-effective. I'd say that we're currently at a semi-tipping-point in the viability of that type of need for housing. 

But, and this is a big one, BUT people are human. That means individuality and the natural urge to rebel in some degree in their own way. We simply don't and can't live the same way. I sort of liken this to living in large cookie-cutter apartments with zero artistic anything that are simply function-oriented only. I suppose that this is all hypothetical, but interesting nontheless.

Increasing restrictions on lenders is great, but it is only a partial solution to the current economical crisis and only brings up more theoretical and philosophical questions on how to handle the transition from irresponsibility to responsibility as well as planning for the future of economic security. 

And lastly, the price of a home is heavily dependent on the cost of materials and quality. To some extent, quantity as well. But there are many other factors; in fact, too many to list. Price of labor/skill, price of materials, availability of materials, location relative to climate/geography, the list goes on and on. Cost of living even factors into the building of a house. As it were, I know a family in Finland who happens to be into the property management and home construction business. I've been to Finland. I have direct knowledge contrasting of all of those factors i mentioned. Simply; it's not the same. Even here in the Midwestern US with an extremely low cost of living and materials/labor, home prices are far greater than $150,000. I wasn't really trying to argue specific numbers; only the vast difference in price compared to the traditional capitalistic way we build houses. For all we know, this town truly can build a house for $25,000 that we are used to paying $150,000+ for. I don't know. I'd love to see some examples, though.

Anyway, you seem to confuse 'nation' and 'state'. A 'state' is the country in and of itself (the institutions etc). The nation is comprised of the people, their nationality (common ancestry etc)


At the start of the 19th century you had a lot of states - with a lot of people of different nationalities in it. Take [the Ottoman Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) for example. (But this is by no means the only example - very nearly all states were like this back then. Wikipedia is a good place to start if you want more proof of this)

At some point in the 19th century nationalism arose, and schisms and uprisings started to be more frequent (Ottoman Empire and [Austria-Hungary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary) being two prime examples), eventually [culminating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria) in the first World War and [Woodrow Wilson's 14 points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Points) (all 14 are interesting, but in light of states changing into nation-states *and* since i mentioned Austria-Hungary, check out point 10)



These schisms, uprisings and wars are the reason why we now have 'nation-states' as opposed to 'states'. This change is noticeable in quite a lot (if not most) European countries (but that's for you to look up)

TL;DR : States were the answer of the (weak) kings to the European feudal times. Nation-states were an iteration upon those, after nationalism got caught in the mix.

(Also check out the [Congress of Vienna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna) which has also been instrumental in this change.)",0,1346703812,null,0,false,0,c62xtfh,t3_zabfg,t1_c62xtfh,t1_c62woys,null,1429808107,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

The likelihood is that most Britons alive today descend from working class people who back then were treated little better than slaves by the people who were inflicting atrocities on other races and had no power to stop it if they were aware of it. Which is true for Britain and probably for most other nations with similar pasts.

I just think that the people of the EU are opposed to both.

The redistribution because the EU government seems to be as democratic a monarchy. Well really there isn't an EU government or there doesn't seem to be one anyway. I'm guessing that's because the member states don't want to give up any of the power that they control.

true,Gro-Tsen,null,null,"&gt; Are places open during weekends? (Sightseeing spots, shops, malls, etc)

Everything is open on Saturday.  Most shops and malls are closed on Sunday, but there are many exceptions (e.g., everything on the Champs-Élysées is open); museums tend to be open on Sunday (the closing day for national museums is Tuesday), but there may also be exceptions.

&gt; And I have a serious question about the bus tickets. I'm purchasing a 3 day pass for zone 1-5 at http://booking.parisinfo.com/z6200e2x26827m466g2603_uk-tour-ticket-paris-visit-pass-transport.aspx for 43,65 € per person. I need transportation from the airport and to the airport when leaving. Need transportation all around the visit, to get to places and whatnot.

It will provide all the transportation you need (metro, ""RER"", bus, within Paris and to the airport) but you can probably get away with cheaper.  According to http://www.ratp.fr/fr/ratp/c_21148/mobilis/ the ""Mobilis"" daily pass costs 6.40€/day for zones 1–2 (i.e., all of Paris and more) and to tickets to Roissy/CDG airport cost 18.50€ (that's 9.25€ each).  So unless you intend to go beyond Paris (e.g., Versailles, La Défense) during your stay, and assuming you're flying to Roissy, you can get away with 3×6.40€ + 18.50€ = 37.70€ (per person) by buying three ""Mobilis"" daily passes and two single-journey tickets to Roissy (and it's probably even cheaper not to buy a pass at all, just 20 tickets at 25.40€ total, use them as needed, you probably won't take the metro or bus 10 times in 2–3 days on top of your trip to/from the airport).  But then, it's a bit more complicated, and maybe the ""Paris Visit"" pass includes free entrances to various places (I don't know about this, I've always suspected it's just a rip-off for tourists but I may be wrong).

If it's Orly you're flying to, I'm not sure (I don't know whether the standard, and very expensive, ""OrlyVal"" is included in the ""Paris Visit"" pass; there are much cheaper ways to get to Orly, e.g., with the Orlybus, but of course they're less convenient).

Bottom line: I'm sure you can find cheaper but then it will be more complicated (and you may have to decide in advance what you'll do).",0,1346710572,null,0,false,0,c62zfaa,t3_zal1u,t1_c62zfaa,t3_zal1u,null,1429808869,4,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,4

Zuzusehen is an infinitive (zusehen) with an prefix because that construction (Ich kann nicht anfangen/aufhören/beginnen) needs an zu.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;Mason, Butcher, Electrician, insurance clerk, you name it.

In the US, electricians must have at least a two-year degree, which we call an associate's degree.  People who operate construction machinery (masons) need to be trained and licensed to use their machines.  And although I'm not sure, I think a person would need a college degree of some type to be an insurance clerk.  Butchers, so far as I know, do not need any degrees.  We don't have independent butchers in the US, so a butcher will be working in a large supermarket or factory where management keeps things safe through employee training and the enforcement of safety regulations.  To our credit, the US government is actually rather strict with food safety, and employers act accordingly.

&gt;if you get a degree as ""waiter"" (actually: restaurant specialist) you can run the whole place)

We don't have such degrees, but we make a very big deal out of a degree in what we call ""restaurant and hotel management,"" which sounds similar, though I think our degrees in that area take a full four years to acquire (i.e., it's a bachelor's degree).  I'm not entirely sure about that, however.  I do know that it is a big deal and not something you'd expect a person to get before becoming a waiter.

- The Commission is not the same as the EU, and in fact the European Parliament, if past actions are anything to go by, would be quite opposed to any reincarnation of ACTA. So saying ""EU Wants to Sneak in a Mini-ACTA by the Backdoor"" must be using some definition of the EU which excludes the Parliament, which is absurd because the Parliament has the final say on pretty much all EU legislation.

- A consultation is not the same as sneaking in a law by the back door. It's not even close. Someone who wanted to sneak in by the backdoor wouldn't consult the homeowner before doing so.

- I'm no expert on Article 14 of the E-commerce Directive, but I cannot find anything to substantiate the claim that the Commission is ""rewriting history"". Anything I can find on the subject backs up the Commission's claim that the article is the basis for notice procedures in the EU.

- To claim that the Commission is trying to label opponents of increased copyright protection as lovers of child pornography is a stretch, to say the VERY least.

Inaccurate and sensationalist articles like these help no one. There are real and important issues with the consultation, which in this article are obscured by weak speculation and rhetoric.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;Not that Americans knew it all in politics, but they never bailed out &gt;their states, so those have to get their finances balanced

The federal government collects an income tax from Americans who make enough to qualify for it (about half the country, I think), as well as taxes to fund federal health care assistance programs.  Since wealthier states contribute more money to these tax programs, there tends to be a flow of money from richer to poorer states. 

The fed also contributes money to things like education and law enforcement, which again causes a distribution of money from richer to poorer states.

Finally, there are now bailouts of certain industries; these bailouts will disproportionately benefit certain areas of the country (e.g., auto industry bailout disproportionately benefited places that make cars).

But you are right: there are no Germany-to-Greece style bailouts of US states by the fed.  For one thing, our transfers and bailouts are controlled by the fed and thus the states do not have complete freedom to use the money however they see fit.  Monies granted in this manner are for specific purposes.  Second, there is democratic control over this process.  The government in Washington is elected  by a process which almost every American perceives as legitimate.

I'm not sure I understand your question.  A single fare ticket from Paris to Roissy is 9.25€, that's the price I used in my calculations.  If you get a Mobilis or Paris Visite pass for zones 1–5 (as you intended) you do not need it (Roissy is included), whereas if you get a Mobilis or Paris Visite pass for zones 1–2 then you will need a separate ticket to get to/from the airport.

&gt; And for the ""zones"": Which zone map is correct?

Actually, neither one is. :-) The correct one is [here](http://www.ratp.fr/informer/pdf/orienter/f_plan.php?loc=reseaux&amp;nompdf=rer&amp;fm=gif) (I hope that link is stable), which is similar to the first you gave except that zones 6 and 7 no longer exist (not that it matters to you anyway).  Note that it is a map of the entire [Île-de-France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8Ele-de-France_%28region%29) region, which is larger than Paris: Paris is zone 1 on that map.

The second map you show is that of Paris itself (i.e., zone 1), generally known as Paris ""intra muros"", and the numbers are the ""arrondissements"" (≈districts) of Paris, which are useful to indicate where places are (as in ""I live in the 13th arrondissement, near Place d'Italie""), for social studies and administrative purposes, but have no incidence whatsoever on transportation prices.  Any metro or RER station within Paris ""intra muros"" is equivalent to any other one as far as the price goes.

Ahem. A state isn't a city, but NY City is by far the most relevant part of NY State, so there are precedents for big bailouts.

&gt;Background: In 1975, New York City had to borrow two-thirds of its operating budget, $8 billion. President Gerald Ford rejected an appeal for help. The intermediate savior was the city's Teachers' Union, which invested $150 million of its pension funds, plus a refinance of $3 billion in debt.

&gt;In December 1975, after city leaders begin addressing the crisis, Ford signed the New York City Seasonal Financing Act, extending the City a line of credit of up to $2.3 billion [approximately $12.82B in 2008 dollars]. The U.S. Treasury earned about $40 million in interest. Later, President Jimmy Carter would sign the New York City Loan Guarantee Act of 1978; again, U.S. Treasury earned interest.",0,1346746673,null,0,false,0,c63783e,t3_zabfg,t1_c63783e,t1_c62xcot,null,1429812631,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I can't think of an example where you would say ""Sie"" for a longer period of time.

2.) Your age will not be a problem.

3.) But you are confusing Rettungssanitäter and Rettungsassistent. Rettungssanitäter training takes 520 hours (13 weeks fulltime). The training and curriculum is defined by the federal state you live in. Therefor your Berlin training might not be recognized by Baden-Württemberg. 

Two years of training are required for the Rettungsassistent, additionally, Rettungsassistent is the only recognised occupation requiring formal training on federal level, therefor it does not matter where you get trained, every federal state will recognize your training. And of course the Rettungsassistent is allowed to do more things and stands in the hierarchy above the Rettungssanitäter and just below a Medical Doctor (usually a Notarzt in Germany). Wikipedia.de has a good article on Rettungsassistent, but beware, the law for Rettungsassistenten is currently being revised and the formal training might change to 3 years instead of 2 with changes to the curriculum too.

Sorry, I don't know the difference between paramedic and paramedic assistant, but the Rettungssanitäter (RettSan) is the lowest training you can get, the Rettungsassistent (RettAss) is allowed to give commands to the RettSan, whereas a RettSan is not allowed to give any commands at all. The RettAss is also allowed to do more medical stuff, like applying adrenaline to a patient. The RettSan is not allowed to do so. 

Maybe the term assistant is confusing, in Germany, the RettAss is an assistant to the emergency doctor, who is usually the highest ranking medic at a scene. 

The formal hierarchy is: emergency doctor gives commands to RettAss and RettSan, RettAss gives commands to RettSan, RettSan gives no commands. In the German military a medical doctor is alway an officer (captain and above) a RettAss is a sergeant and a RettSan usually a junior sergeant. 


AFAIK your UK DL is recognized in Germany, but if you are already allowed to drive vehicles heavier than 3.5 tons it should not be a problem. You can even get a German DL if you live longer than 6 month in Germany. 


The curriculum is in discussion due to practical reasons. The German emergency system is based on a medical doctor with an additional 2 year training as emergency doctor. When there is an accident, an ideal team consist of an RettSan, RettAss and an emergency doctor. I know for example that the US system differs, the usually don't send out medical doctors. But unfortunately I don't know anything about the UK system. 

One problem with the current training is mainly a formal one. RettAss are allowed to do some medical stuff but are not allowed to do other stuff only a MD is allowed to do. However, when there is no MD on the scene and the RettAss (or even RettSan) is alone, he will try to save the patient and also do the forbidden stuff - which might result in legal problems. Therefor the current training is revised and will probably be extended to 3 years training including more ""medical stuff"" and clearing up those legal issues.

I am not saying that because they have 9 mil people living in Europe (+all the guys living in Germany and actually in Europe) - they are completely an European country.. 

What I AM saying is that because they already have 9 mil in Europe.. and since their territory actually stretches out to Europe too.. and because they have a long historical connection with Europe..
there is enough evidence for them to consider their country to be part of Europe, and for others to consider Turkey as partly European.. 

There are three main differences in this case that separate Turkey from the examples you gave:

Finland probably has no reason to seek recognition as a Scandinavian country, because why? They get absolutely nothing out of that, and it really doesn't matter at all for their country. Turkey wants to be part of the EU, so there is motivation for them to seek recognition to their European belonging. That goes to speak that Turkey wants to be politically and economically more integrated with European countries, and the first step is to claim that they are in Europe, which they are - to some extent. 

British and other Empires that had controlled territories that are now not considered Europe - The idea that they controlled territory outside of Europe is not the same as Turkey controlling territory in Europe. For five centuries their country extended deep into European ground.. 

take India for example, besides the colonial history - where they were just controlled by an European power.. they have no other qualification to be European, their location is simply way too far away from the European continent, and they do not share borders, no territory and no significant relations to Europe.. Nor do they foster any kind of motivation to be recognized as European..

Usually, almost every professional branch has negotiated, in addition, more specific rules, for example SYNTEC. A ""convention collective"" is supposed to be at least equally good for the workers than the ""Code du travail"" (both are applying).    
Regarding training, there are organisms (OPCA), managed by worker unions and company unions (I don't know how to translate ""patronat""). Every company pays taxes for training, and OPCAs collect and manage that money. FAFIEC is an OPCA.    
Now, if you want to use your training hours, it's quite complicated (at least in my experience). Companies are supposed to have a training plan. If yours do, then you can choose one of their training programs and ask them to do it using your DIF hours. If they don't, I think you can choose a training program (which must be approved by the OPCA...), and ask your company to do it (brace yourself, paperwork is coming). I don't really know how that goes, but the training must be useful for both you and your company (to have a better knowledge of your job or of a future position in your company). If you use your right after having left your company, it must be consistent with your carrier.    
Unfortunately, FAFIEC seems to be answering only by phone or letter but maybe someone in your company knows about this. Try to find who pays them the taxes, maybe. The page to sign up on the FAFIEC website seems to be for the companies, not the workers.

The awesome thing about it is that not only it gives you some great historical facts about the dishes, but the recipes include what they do in Italy, and how you can around things you can't find in the US (for example, the flour). I've made a few of these dishes for Sicilian friends and they asked me for the recipes!!

If you do get yourself a copy, you must try the arancine and the Sicilian style pizza - most of the dishes are very cheap and easy to make, but delicious!

true,velidb,BOSN,Bosnia and Herzegovina,"Hi Jack! How are you doing today? Let me introduce myself, my name is Velid (as my user name suggests, but it's not your typical American name.. so I figured I'd introduce myself). I grew up in Gornji Vakuf - Uskoplje, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Was born there in 1989, three years before the war. Had lived there all throughout the war, and was lucky to have my family survive and for the war to end right around the time I was supposed to go to school. When I say that, well, I was lucky I could attend some shit fucking classes taught by people who spent the last 5 years barely surviving in the massive bombings (see, my town was about 80% destroyed), who probably had serious psychological issues at the time. 

Later on, the things started getting into their places, and yeah, I had the privilege of attending school regularly and living in a pretty peaceful country. Around the time for high school - and I had to go to one of these ""two schools under one roof"" institutions.. where I was prohibited from going to the first floor, had to use a different entrance to the same building and my class breaks and ending times were different so as to make sure that I was in no contact with the ""other"" students. The others were Croats, as they make for about 40% of my town, while the rest are Bosniaks. 

See mate, I kind of laughed at this situation too. As I was about the age when I started to use my head, and I really did think it was ridiculous. So two years in, I had transferred to an international high school in Mostar, - boarding school, where I actually lived with a Croat from Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina. You know what's crazy, we realized that our fathers had attended the same University (political sciences in Sarajevo) around the same time. Then they went on to work for the government in pretty much the same positions (related to the ministry of defense), and then they had to be on the opposing sides of a battle and very likely were shooting at each other at some point. They never knew that. But hey, because I could attend a school with IB program, and could sit in the same class and share a room with a Croat, we became great friends and realized the silly shit that life threw at our parents. 

But Jack, only because you and me laughed it off, doesn't mean that everyone else out there is smart enough to realize this. I mean, most of these teenagers brains are like big black holes waiting for knowledge and information to suck it in, and it's just a question of what type of knowledge and information they will be served. 

But then again.. Jack, you and I know better.. that's what matters mate.. AMIRITE? HAHAHA!

So there, a little more personal account of why this political move is incredibly important, and why it should be a little less funny.. (in case the downvotes didn't say it all) 

(Also, I keep calling you Jack, but please know that I am fairly aware of the low probability that your actual name is Jack Black.. having attended Northwestern University for four years provided me with a decent training on American pop culture..)

With a different outlook towards collectivity and different sensibilities borne from a different history, but **with the same coherence**, many European societies, France included, have chosen to enforce several significant limitations on the freedom of speech principle, in order to prop up and strengthen societal values and common grounds that matter to them. Hence the interdiction of hate or revisionist speech, the niqab ban, etc.

During WW2, the Vichy French government went beyond what the Nazi occupier desired and set up on its own its **local program of genocide** against jews, immigrants, romas, gays, etc. We remember that; we also remember that France massively bled from **religious wars** from the 16th century onwards to the 18th century, and later went through a massive societal crisis that was inches from devolving into a civil war at the separation of churches and state at the beginning of the 20th century.

But some of the pollsters are definitely asking explicitly about the Pirate Party (de Hond, for example), and if there are any that do not, I'm sure they include an ""other-specify"" option. The problem is rather that there are just not enough people expressing a preference for the Pirate Party. De Hond's poll had the Pirates getting 1 seat (i.e. about 0.7% of the vote) for a few weeks, but even in his poll they lost that last seat.

EDIT: The question why people are not voting Pirate is a good one, and I guess a combination of different factors. The last Dutch government has actually, AFAIK, been pretty good on digital rights, so that might be part of it. I think the German Pirates benefited from being the latest choice of protest voters, but with 10+ parties in the race in the Netherlands, there are plenty of alternatives if you want to cast a protest vote. 

Similarly, I have the impression that the German Pirates are in a way benefiting from the absence of ideological choices in the German party system. Somehow they seem to be appealing to both left-liberal voters who are adrift between the FDP and the Greens and young voters looking for a radical, alternative left-wing party who have no affinity with the former communists of the Linke. But in the Dutch party system, there are already parties appealing to those electoral constituencies: for center-left liberals we have D66, and on the radical left we have the SP, unburdened by the historical luggage that drags the Linke down.

It's not a lack of interest in digital rights issues, I don't think. Although the economic crisis does tend to push such postmaterialist concerns aside a bit.",0,1346758583,null,0,1346759139,0,c638dt5,t3_zb6tk,t1_c638dt5,t1_c636v8z,null,1429813336,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,almodozo,null,null,"Re: the absence of conservative green parties who appeal to nostalgia for a pre-industrial, traditional past, I think ChemicalPleasure hit the nail on the head. For many West-European countries (at least in the North-west), the era of an agricultural, majority-rural society is just so long ago that there is no resonance for an appeal to restore that era's values. 

Small farming may still dominate a notable chunk of society in, say, Poland even now, and in countries like Hungary and Poland the rural, farming-centred economy was dominant for the majority of the population at least until WW2. But in the Netherlands, if you were to go looking for a time when over half of the population worked in agriculture, my guess is you'd have to go all the way back to the 19th century, a time long forgotten, especially in what, compared to Eastern Europe, is a fairly ahistorical society. The result is that there is just no strand in Dutch culture that's comparable to the kind of patriotic, christian groups in Central/Eastern Europe that romanticize the rural, small-town past in that way. Our Green parties have a very different background, they tend to be rooted in the environmental, peace and women's movements of the eighties. 

The closest you'd get I suppose is the small Christian Union and SGP, our ""Bible Belt"" parties, but the vote for those parties is really quite strictly defined by specific denominational affiliations. You don't vote SGP out of some general longing back for the good old days, you vote SGP because you belong to the specific protestant denomination they cater for. Our nationalists of the Freedom Party, on the other hand are very much urban/suburban-based.

Thinking of other countries, Britain and Germany were also much more industrialized much earlier than the Central-East European countries (other than the Czech Republic). A sort of conservative-green party, the  ÖDP, has never grasped hold of any nation-wide support in Germany, but it has been [getting two percent](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96kologisch-Demokratische_Partei#Landtagswahlergebnisse) of the vote in state elections in Bavaria for quite a while, which is perhaps not coincidentally one of the least industrialized parts of the country. In Wales and Scotland, the nationalist parties there (Plaid Cymru and the SNP) long fulfilled a role similar to what you describe, but they've long moved to the left or center-left as their old, rural, nostalgic-minded voters started dying out.

In France, where agriculture kept playing a larger role in the economy for longer, a conservative green party of sorts has been active on a sort of national scale: Chasse Pêche Nature et Traditions (""Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition""). That group only tends to receive 1-2% in national elections (other than the time their leader got 4% of the first-round presidential election vote in 2002), but they have been receiving 4-7% of the vote in European elections for some twenty years now, and play a role regionally.

true,almodozo,null,null,"&gt;Neoliberal ideology... what does that have to do with conservatism? That is something appropriate for a right-wing liberal party, not a conservative party.

Yes, I think this is a difference between, roughly speaking, Western Europe and East-Central Europe. Because our conservatives are, very broadly speaking, the neoliberals, and vice versa. At the danger of glossing over the many political differences between countries, whether you look at Britain, Germany, France, Italy or Spain, the political system is basically polarized along a simple leftwing vs rightwing cleavage. And the right-wing parties are both culturally conservative and pro-market, whereas the left-wing parties are both culturally progressive and, to some (though increasingly feeble, since the arrival of Blair, Schroeder et al.) degree, more inclined to support state intervention in the economy and/or the welfare state. 

In the Netherlands, we used to have a three-current landscape (socialists vs christian-democrats vs liberals). But the main Christian-Democratic party has long embraced a market-economy and austerity-focused economic philosophy, and only really differs from the liberals on cultural issues. When it comes to the economy, ever since the days of Lubbers in the eighties, they are basically neoliberals-light.

It's only the rise of the far right that has scrambled this picture a bit, since parties like the Front National in France are economically to the left of the mainstream conservative parties. This has happened in the Netherlands too: while the List Pim Fortuyn and then the Freedom Party started out with a robust pro-market, anti-state economical agenda, Wilders has been steadily moving to the left on economic policy, since he knows that many of his working class voters are yearning for some kind of protection against the perceived vagaries of the market.

I live in Hungary, so I know that in much of Central/Eastern Europe, the political system works quite differently. The way it looks to me, you don't seem to have a simple left vs right cleavage so much in many countries here, as rather a system of three cultural-political poles. In one corner the ex-communists on the ""left"", who pay rhetorical lip-service to protecting their poor, working class and elderly constituencies though the party leaders have long embraced the business opportunities of neoliberalism; in another corner the liberals, who love the free market even more but are best known for championing progressive and postmaterialist cultural causes; and in the third corner the christian/conservative/nationalist right, which sometimes is the most 'left-wing' of all on economic policy, favouring a fair degree of state intervention/control.

I think the difference between East and West on this score is a function of:

a) The weakness of a statist, culturally conservative right in the West. (The old Gaullists used to fit the bill, but even before Sarkozy the French mainstream right had long shifted to more neoliberal policies. Same with the Bavarian CSU and the like.) There has just not been enough of a, eh, market (sorry) for that brand of politics anymore since the agricultural and christian past disappeared from collective memory and the new, post-industrial economy created a society of individualist, secular urbanites - at least not enough to support a mainstream political force. In as far as there is still a political void there, the far right is doing its best to fill it now, but their rallying points are opposition to immigration, Islam, the EU and crime, rather than small-c conservatism.

b) The weakness of a proper socialist/social-democratic left in the East. The communists ruined the brand, possibly forever, and the ex-communist parties are still 'squatting' the natural left-wing constituencies, even though they govern more like neoliberals. This has left a huge opening for conservative/populist/nationalist parties to take on the role of defenders of the little man and proponents of some state intervention/control in the economy. See the Kaczynski brothers, Viktor Orban, and previously Vladimir Meciar.

I guess, by and large, a simpler way to put is that in Western Europe, the main political cleavage tends to be defined by economic policy, with cultural issues playing only a secondary role. Only the far right with its cultural appeals and populist economic rhetorics muddies that picture. Whereas in Eastern Europe, the main political cleavage tends to be defined by cultural politics. When it comes to economic policy, every party promises to 'soften' the economic reforms when in opposition and does whatever the EU, IMF etc say anyway once they're in government, but it's cultural politics (religion, nationalism, attitude to communist past) that tend to determine what parties someone votes for.

A way to check whether that's true I guess is to check for exceptions. What parties are there in Western Europe that are considered left-wing, even though their economic views lean right, or are considered right-wing, even though their economic views lean left? The far right in some countries comes closest I guess. And what parties in Central-Eastern Europe are considered left-wing, even though they lean right in cultural politics, or are considered right-wing, even though they lean left in cultural politics? I dunno .. maybe the Polish Peasants Party, considered center-left but I assume quite conservative culturally?

The phrase ""washing one's hands of"" something, means declaring one's unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or share complicity in it.

In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse an imagined stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding crimes she had committed and induced her husband to commit.


It has also been found that people, after having recalled or contemplated unethical acts, tend to wash hands more often than others, and tend to value hand washing equipment more. Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a contemplation are less likely to engage in other ""cleansing"" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.

It would, however, be a horrible idea for the PvdA, for both programmatic and strategic reasons. It would sit in a coalition with three parties that are all wedded to austerity economics and obeying the 3% budget line no matter what. (D66, while still overall a center-left party thanks to its progressive cultural values, seems to be intent on out-budget-cutting the VVD). So at best it would be able to push through some minor adjustments from the left (maybe they can bring Melkert-jobs back) ... otherwise, it would basically be propping up a right-wing government. Strategically speaking, this would be a disaster for them, almost certain to make the SP defeat them after all at the next elections.

A left-wing government along the lines of SP-PvdA-GL-D66 will not just lack a majority in the Senate, as you point out, but I don't see them winning one in Parliament either, really. Moreover, considering D66's current economic line, I don't think it would ever join such a cabinet.  

Instead, the only alternative ""over left"" I can hypothetically imagine would be one in which the PvdA and SP would join with the CDA and the Christian Union. It would definitely serve the PvdA a lot better (and, from my particular political POV, the country too). Far-fetched? Absolutely. Probably right up there with pigs flying. (It would also be the least popular possible government among Dutch redditors.) But if the PvdA should stubbornly refuse to join what would basically be another austerity government, the politicians might just be forced to end up with something like this alternative ... and maybe the CDA will be desperate enough to stay in government to bite. 

Those are big ifs, of course. For one, I wouldn't trust the PvdA to not fold long before that. I think Samsom will swallow his protestations soon enough if some kind of new purple government can be formed. And while the CDA seems to be more open to looking left than in a long time, thanks to its weak leadership and many of its few remaining activists being of the squishy, social type, it would still be a *huge* step for them to join up with not just one, but two kinds of reds.

Stando a [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_E._Jones) (scusate, è la prima fonte che ho trovato), Jones non lavora più alla BYU dal 2006, dopo che la sua attività fu sospesa dall'università perché un po' troppo controversa e veemente.

Il paper citato dall'articolo è stato pubblicato dalla Bentham Science Publishers, che è abbastanza nota per una peer review, diciamo così, non molto rigida, e per attività [che qualcuno](http://gunther-eysenbach.blogspot.it/2008/03/black-sheep-among-open-access-journals.html) definirebbe [spammatorie](http://poynder.blogspot.it/2008/04/open-access-interviews-matthew-honan.html ""Ammesso che ''spammatorio'' sia una parola.""). Quando, anni fa, uno dei loro journal pubblicò un articolo di Steven Jones, uno degli editori [si dimise](http://screwloosechange.blogspot.it/2009/04/bentham-editor-resigns-over-steven.html) perché non aveva dato l'autorizzazione alla pubblicazione.

Quanto al contenuto dell'articolo, non commento, poiché non sono un esperto di esplosivi.

Turkey also has a very rich history in Europe having controlled most of The Balkans up until around one hundred years ago. This led to large amounts of people emigrating from places such as Serbia and Bulgaria to Turkey. The Turkish people are also mainly descended from pre-Islamic Anatolian people who share many similarities with Greeks.

As stated elsewhere, large amounts of the Turkish population live in what is mainland Europe and the population living there is greater than that of many European countries.

What you hear is mostly viewed by some uninformed outside source, or is told by some biased inside source, or assumes that the country is homogeneous.

For example this site was the only one who promoted the far-right Jobbik during the 2010 elections, because no other media was willing to do so. This is also the site that prompted the government to put one of the disputed paragraphs into the media law about mandatory registration of large internet news sites. There are no English editions of objective news sites in Hungary. The country is also still one of the worst English knowing countries in Europe. Let me just translate parts of the two paragraphs:

""... he comments on kuruc.info, the last time for example he was encouraging people to send in personal information about people who were protesting against Laszlo Csatary. He was offering 75K HUF (~260EUR) for the information. ""

""They published the organizers names, phone numbers and internet addresses ... The protesters have then received serious threats, multiple of them have filed reports with the police. One of them .... received phone calls from California too, from a phone registered to Bela Varga's wife. ""

""Maybe this, maybe some other abuse have made the traditionally freedom-of-speech loving anonymity services to drop kuruc.info, but on July 20'th, more than 6 years after registration, the Domains by Proxy has have dropped kuruc.info. ... ""

This is just the latest of illegal actions that the site was organizing.

Awwwww cute. Guess what, idiot? Every state has it's own culture but only the Bavarians make a big thing out of it. Would you say that the WBC members are the only nuttes in the US because they make the biggest fuzz about it? 

Better education? Is putting good pupil into Hauptschulen and give those pupils no way of going up again or to get their HZB easily on another way 
a good education? I know brilliant people that would do pretty well in a industry focused college but they can't because the Bavarians in charge think their education system is so superior, that they only take the best of the best for college (college like in Kolleg/Gymnasium and not as in American college). There are plenty of documentaries about pupil that should go on a Bavarian Hauptschule and did a flat 1 Abitur in other states after the parents have moved. And don't you dare to say that this is the difference between Bavaria and Lower Saxony and other states. That's just bullshit.

Yes, Bavaria is doing pretty well compared to other states [as you might see here](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_(Deutschland)#Wirtschaft) but DAYUM look at that 55k€ BiP per capita from Hamburg. Have you ever heard them complaining how much we suck and how much they don't? Me neither. Bremen at second place. And then, Hessen! You better don't say how awesome your finances are when a smaller state, without a unique culture (because since you don't know where I am from, you can't make an assumption about the uniqueness of the culture you're comparing Bavarian culture to so I assume you generalised a bit), with a worse education system, with a shitty landscape, without a big party with a lot of drunken non-Bavarians and with bad cars does a lot better than you in finances.

Nice landscape? Yeah ever been to south Bavaria? It's not that pretty to look at if you have to drive on a wiggly line street through a tonne of sodding 3 houses villages to get to the next civilised place.

Oktoberfest? Never been there, never want to. Not what I'd enjoy and that's why I don't comment on it (except for the above because that's just a fact).

Nice cars? Well, that's true. Enjoy your nice cars without our steel in the west. BMW probably makes good cars but I doubt that the latest models are anywhere near being a Bavarian only product. 

By the way, you can do that with every state. So don't you think Bavarian is the shittiest state ever, dear non-Germans!

My last post was meant as a bit of Bavarian poking like everybody does it and every Bavarian who has at least a bit of humour does that as well. I'd normally ignore a comment like yours but you better inform yourself a bit more before you're trying to be an arse (remember?

true,Asyx,NRHW,"North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","&gt; No, all the rest of Germany has no more culture that's still alive than its different accents. Feel free to prove me wrong.

Karneval? Cologne - Düsseldorf? I can't understand a Cologne accent even though it's like 20 minutes from main station to main station by train. Food. There is a lot of food that nobody outside of the region knows. of course that overlaps but Bavaria was always ""together"" while ""North rhine westphalia"" already says that there is something missing... like the south... So NRW and Rhineland-Palatinate knows the Piddelkuchen while Bavarians don't (and I've checked that 2 minutes ago). The north has still a very alive tea culture. Damn the east was another country a bit over 20 years ago. Of course there's still something we would call cultural differences. Just look at potato salad. 

&gt; It's common knowledge that education in Germany gets worse the further north you go (Nord-Süd-Gefälle""). That's what studies say.

Of course studies say that. I just out chances for everybody over ""send the elite to university and let the rest rot on a farm"".

&gt; I'm not sure where you're from, but since it's not Bavaria and you're aggressive as fuck, I guess you're not too far from what used to be Prussia, haha. On the other hand, to be fair, you don't seem to be technically stupid, so maybe you're not actually Prussian.

NRW and I get pretty aggressive is somebody is calling me stupid while making claims that are easily to be disproved or, like in this case, just existing because the Bavarian culture is more publicly known. Of course you might think that Bavarian culture is unique but what's the difference between wearing shitty Lederhosen compared to wearing shitty green suites, disgustingly ugly hats and shooting with 6mm sport ammo on wooden birds that don't look like birds? The only real purpose is drinking in both states. Another culture thing, beer! I'd call 10-15 local breweries in the Düsseldorfer old town (and I think it's not different in Cologne) a pretty big culture thing.

&gt; Also it's funny how you assume I was from Bavaria, because I'm not. But I've been there, and if I wanted to stay in Germany, I'd move to Bavaria for sure.

You've said that you're not from Bavaria. I just think ""one"" sounds too royal sometimes which is why I used the other and, according to dict.leo.org, interchangeable pronoun ""you"" which might sound as I'd address you directly especially since ""man"" is way more common as a general pronoun than ""you"" in German. I could also just have talked about ""you"" but meant the Bavarians every now and then.

&gt; Now you're telling me about the beer in Cologne and Düsseldorf being awesome somehow. Once again I have to point out that the small breweries who win at competitions like the World Beer Cup, are from Bavaria. The best Kölsch this year was from Tempe in Arizona, not from Cologne. Also most beer people here in NRW drink is eventually from huge corporations like Dr. Oetker, not from small independent breweries at all.

I've never said the beer is awesome. I've said it's a part of our culture. OUR unique Düsseldorfer or Cologne culture. I've never said it would win in competition. I actually think that the different beer (Alt and Kölsch) does spoil us for other beers (that's why Düsseldorfer can't drink Kölsch (because it tastes like water for us) and the Colognes can't drink Alt (because it has a too heavy taste on his own. It's like chlorinated tap water in the US which would make us puke but Americans don't give a damn)). There are actually breweries here in Düsseldorf that brew themselves. I don't know if they are all in the old town but they exist.

&gt; The funniest thing is people drinking Früh Kölsch in Cologne and blaming Americans for drinking Bud Light. Because those taste nearly identical, haha.

The mainstream media does their best to publicly persecute anyone who gives the slightest hint of supporting the Sweden Democrats, ruining careers to the left and right, getting people harassed and threatened for their political opinions. Meanwhile, every time avpixlat.info publishes the name of left-wing extremists that are actually being violent both against their opponents and the police, they're called a threat to democracy.

I will admit that offering money for personal information seems a bit shady, but it also seems that the police is doing absolutely nothing to stop the threats and harassment against Jobbik sympathizers.

true,TheExiled,FRAN,France,"kuruc.info supported Jobbik, but it is not Jobbik's website. The extreme right in Hungary is much more diverse. Here are a few hints of information about that :

* Unlike what you're saying about Sweden, the subjects of Hungary's extreme-right racism are not so much immigrants than people that have been in Hungary for generations (if not centuries), most notably : roms and jews.

* Links between the Jobbik and other extreme-right paramilitary (unarmed) organizations exist (magyar garda, csendorség, and others), even though not violent as a group (but can be individually), can be scary. Scary because of their organization is top-notch (they meet, dress up in uniforms, march). They are quite influencial and their message is a message of hate.

* In regard to this, a few years ago several roma were murder in bomb attacks. At first the police didn't do anything pretending there was some gas explosion, although one of the victims, a child, was riddled with bullets. There were several such murders (bombs and shootings) over the course of several months, racially motivated. So when a website such as kuruc.info pays for information about people, but also sometimes publishes such information, it can lead to nasty things.

* Jobbik sympathizers are free to say what they want. When a gay pride is organized in Budapest, extreme-right counter protests are allowed, and they do happen. There is no police harassement against those Jobbik sympathizers.

EDIT:

* There are also various extreme-right publications, such as Barikad! which are completely legal and not going to be shut down.
