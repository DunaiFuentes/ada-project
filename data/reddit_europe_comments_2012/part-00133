true,Bob_goes_up,DENK,Denmark,"We have a fairly big cannabis marked in Denmark. The bikers used to control it, but they are getting older, and that has left room for the immigrant gangs.

The Bandidos used to have a strategy of allying themselves with the immigrant gangs whereas the Hells Angels tried to create an (ethnic Danish??) youth organisation named ak81 to rival the immigrant youth gangs. But lately the situation has become more muddy. Hells Angels have tried to ally with some of the ethnic gangs including Brothas and Black Cobra, and it looks like The two biker gangs will have another war soon.

Regarding Al Jazeera report, we do of course have an integration problem in Denmark. Part of this is due to racism, but at the same time a large percentage of the first generation of immigrant parents didn't understand the Danish society well enough to raise their kids to function well in the society.

true,DisregardMyPants,UNSA,United States,"&gt;This seems... excessively optimistic. Let's look at the major cloud companies: Amazon, Google, Rackspace, Microsoft, etc. What they have in common is that they're almost all US companies. Now let's look at the major economic value provided by cloud computing: the ability for companies to reduce or eliminate their IT department, i.e. local employees. From a broken-glass perspective, this could actually end up being a net loss for Europe.


I rent servers in a variety of countries(12 right now), and in some of them have used practically every major server provider in those countries. A lot of them are pretty significantly behind and are quite expensive for not that much value.

Germany has created a server powerhouse with Hetzner. France, Spain, and Italy are lackluster when it comes to servers. The United Kingdom already has a solid cloud infrastructure in place at competitive prices. I haven't seen much growth or potential in the European server market aside from the UK and Germany though. The Eastern European market is always cheap, but there are huge trust issues with putting your data on a server in the Ukraine, Russia, or similar countries.

Without some major turnarounds, I don't see the EU dominating the cloud anytime soon...unless you count American companies opening up branches in Ireland to avoid heftier tax rates elsewhere.

&gt;If I were the EU I would start asking, ""why is Europe awful at making blockbuster tech companies?"", 

Labor laws in the EU are not built with a startups in mind where a deadweight employee can easily be 10-15% of your revenue and long hours are the norm. They're built to deal with large companies who can absorb losses from bad employees.

&gt;• The best thing abut being in Paris is experiencing the French culture and visiting the historic sites.

&gt; • The worst thing about being in Paris is the annoying politeness. That sounds trivial, I know, but seriously just give me a damn apple without going through the whole bon jour/merci process.

Two sides of the same coin. You can't experience the culture when you try to experience only the positive. There will always be things that you're not accustomed to... In the US I dislike overly attached waiters, but it's part of the culture (working for their tip), so I make my best. In the end I doesn't irk me anymore, because it's part of the experience.

And moreover, having to say ""bonjour"" or ""merci"" brings one of the positive experience : people being friendly to you. If you're too constrained by the politeness, drop it! And then, well, people might not be as friendly. You can't have one without the other.

&gt; Parisians walk fast. Everyone seems to be in a rush to get where they're going. Relax already!

My feeling is that you're experiencing the city as a tourist. No problem with that — but wait until you're living &amp; working here... We're all rushing to get to work, to get back from work, we're trying to get in time for a date or a meeting, we have purposes that you, as a tourist, might not have. We see the stunning architecture every day, from the morning coffee to the late-night stroll... we relax at other times, in other ways...

&gt; The beer selection kind of sucks.

Wanna know about some good bars with Belgian beers?  ;)

As with the coffee, well, you might have gone to rare spots (some addresses here : http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/29/ristretto-paris-is-brewing/?pagewanted=all), as most bars and restaurants make overburnt/bitter/bad coffees.

&gt; Everyone dresses nice in Paris. That's a bad thing because I don't like to dress up.

Well, you're a tourist so you get a free pass ;)

I noticed that Parisians (and myself) dress with style as a courtesy to the rest of the population. It's politeness for the eyes. The parisian style is very classic and quite conservative (not as experimental as NYC for example), and it makes a very conform-looking crowd...

&gt; The touristy sites are crowded (no surprise) and it really takes the specialness out of it.

As an American in France, it took me some time to grow accustomed to this.  Sometimes if you don't say ""bonjour"" when entering a boutique or boulangerie, you can get a cold shoulder.  That's because it's considered rude not to announce your entry and dismissal (unless the place is packed).  It's not something that we require in America, but then again, in America, we have our own habits and customs that a foreign person might see as strange.  


When I returned to the U.S. after spending a year in Paris, I was blown away by the forwardness of Americans. I grew accustomed to the way that French people speak to me.  When I went home, I was asked a lot of invasive questions, by strangers, in places like a local quick mart.  Americans have no qualms about asking you all sorts of questions, when they don't even know you.  For instance, I went to a gas station to buy a pack of smokes, and the girl behind the counter asked me why I prefer Camel over Marlboro. *How the hell is that her business?*  She didn't even know my name.  When I went to Chicago to apply for a new visa, I was hounded by some person on the train that wanted to know what I was doing in Chicago, how long I was staying, and what I did for a living.  Some guy standing in front of me in line for the Shedd Aquarium went through an array of personal questions.  You won't have people asking you these sorts of invasive things in Paris, that's for sure. 

I don't think that the French are annoyingly polite.  I think that Americans can be annoyingly IMpolite when they're experiencing a different culture and don't understand the customs.  We see France as being part of western culture, and therefore expect them to act a lot more like us. Well, they do not share the same cultural values, and they hold on strongly to a lot of traditions. We go to a place like China and we expect things to be ""weird"", but for some reason when we visit France, we have a different notion about how things should work.

true,FrisianDude,FRIE,Friesland,"""Keuninge"" (kings) is pretty much the same in Frisian. :P 

But the actual linguistic branch English belongs to is Anglo-Frisian, subset of West-Germanic, subset of Germanic, so in terms of origin Frisian is certainly closer to English than French is. The Normans make the distinction far less obvious, of course. I'd easily argue many 'upper class' terms would be more close to French, whereas many lower class are more related to Frisian and to some extent German and Dutch. Mind you, I am merely interested in linguistics rather than an expert, but there are some great cognates. Schule-School-School-Skoalle vs Ecole (spelling?), for example, though both *school* and *ecole* are the same root again. *Church* is better perhaps; kirche-kerk-church-tsjerke vs eglise. 

Then again, *pork* and *beef* are *porc* and *bouef*. Though *pig* and *cow* are closer to *big* (piglet, actually) and *koe* than to *cochon* and *vache*. Though *big*, an adult one is *varken*, and *koe* are Dutch rather than Frisian which calls them *baarch* (cognate is boar) and *ko*.

Mais si tu considère que le fascisme c'est un point de vue idéologique prônant l'unité de la nation en supprimant les individus identifié comme hétérogènes (c'est a dire les gens qui ne sont pas de la bonne ""origine"", qui sont de la mauvaise religion, qui n'ont pas les bonnes idées (en général socialiste ou communiste), alors il y a des arguments d'une tendance fasciste au FN.

Essentiellement, les attaques contre les arabes/musulmans (j'associe les deux parce que de façon intéressantes les deux sont très clairement indissociable dans leur programme, ils proposent par exemple de créer un [ ministère de l’émigration et de la laïcité](http://www.frontnational.com/le-projet-de-marine-le-pen/refondation-republicaine/laicite/)  ) avec en sous main les attaques contre les juifs, avec toujours la même technique: d'abord on attaque les musulman, puis on attaques les juif pour montrer qu'on est ""laïc"". ainsi le débat sur la viande hallal qui entraine avec lui la viande kascher, le débat sur le port du foulard qui entraine la kippa (a noter que lorsqu’on parlait du voile intégrale, le FN n’était pas laïc mais féministe) et je suis sur que d'ici six mois on aura le débat sur la circoncision.

De façon plus argumenté, voila quelques mesure sur l'immigration et la religion tiré du programme du FN [ici](http://www.frontnational.com/le-projet-de-marine-le-pen/refondation-republicaine/laicite/) et [la](http://www.frontnational.com/le-projet-de-marine-le-pen/autorite-de-letat/immigration/):

* Réduction en 5 ans de l’immigration légale de 200 000 entrées par an à 10 000 entrées par an. 
* Suppression du regroupement familial.
* Suppression du droit du sol.
* Suppression de la double nationalité.
* Expulsion systématique de toute personne qui entre ou se maintient illégalement sur le territoire national.
* Suppression de l’Aide Médicale d’Etat (AME)
* Interdiction de toute manifestation communautaire dans les services publics pour l’ensemble des usagers, notamment le port du voile ou de tout autre signe religieux ostentatoire. Une réflexion sera engagée pour étendre cette disposition aux transports publics.
*Les fidèles devront construire leurs lieux de culte avec leur propre argent, quelle que soit la religion concernée. Afin de limiter toute infiltration d’une idéologie politico-religieuse, il ne sera pas possible non plus de faire appel à de l’argent provenant de l’étranger.

Sans discuté le bien fondé de tel ou tel mesure particulières ou la faisabilité (pour installer les lois, notamment dans la constitution, ou pour les faire appliquer) ou encore les conséquences économiques, on voit que la lignes directrice c'est la suppression de l’immigration en stoppant l’immigration illégale (et en empechant d'en discuté, ""Suppression, dans le droit français, de la possibilité de régulariser des clandestins."",""Les manifestations de clandestins ou de soutien aux clandestins seront interdites.""), de mener une vie impossible a la rare immigration légale et d’empêcher au maximum la pratique de la foi musulman.

A noté que j'ai eu la flemme de rassembler les mesures sur la préférence nationale (ou comme on dit, je laisse la question comme exercice aux lecteurs) mais ça noircit encore un peu plus le tableau.

Une autre partie intérressante a mon avis c'est l'anti-comunisme/socialisme. On pourrais croire que le parti qui-est-toujours-diabolisé-et-jamais-jugé-sur-ces-idées aurait a cœur d’éviter les jugements a l'emporte pièce mais au reunions du FN tu as des foules qui crient ""comuniste assassin""* et tu as toujours le sempiternel commentaires sur le-parti-avec-des-millions-de-mort-sur-les-mains (On aimerait bien savoir qui le PCF a tuer...). 

Donc au final, de mon point de vue, si parler de fascisme concernant le programme du FN est abusif, il y a de vrais tendances idéologique fasciste dans le programme du FN.

Yes this is perfectly normal. If the airplane is passing through layers of air with little to no wind the contrail will remain thin and compact. Also the larger the temperature difference between exhaust fumes and air, the stronger the diffusion and secondary air movements caused by the heat exchange.

If however there's some air movement present it will quickly spread out, and given the right circumstances this may trigger further condensation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_condensation_nuclei

&gt; Moreover commercial airplanes may not legally fly that close, only military vehicles.

Lets think about what we see in that video. This looks very much like a refuling operation, which should be no surprise as AWACS stay in the air for very long spans of time. In flight refuling is a normal operation for those. Here's a nice video filmed upclose http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxti-Cxvtjo

So what happens there is, that after refuling has been completed the AWACS needs to clear off the tanker. And the most dangerours direction to accelerate to is forward.

I don't think it's their intention, but I also don't think it's a great idea to be overestimating the EU when it comes to positively impacting the unemployment rate.

&gt;Sounds like a question put forward in Economics lesson for 16 year olds,who try to solve the problems of economic crisis and other negative externalities.

Acting like an asshole isn't an argument. If there's not many deaths in the UK from fishing, chances are whatever problems exist are pretty specific and don't need a broadly sweeping bill.

&gt;I mean,what would people who get paid probably quiet substantial amount of money in their specific sector because of their expertees would know in terms of how to solve problems?

[Appeal to Authority fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority). If you can't defend the bill on the basis of it's contents and it's specific application to the UK, don't defend it at all. Appeal to authority is simply lazy thinking.

Beyond that, experts in health and safety are not experts in business...and business is more the point I was getting at in my above reply. 

&gt;Yeah,because UK is the unique case in the whole of UK. No need to reform anything,have a read here - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/8691186.stm

No one is denying that Fisherman die at sea. Getting tangled in nets and pulled overboard is a well known problem, one that all fisherman know about and try to avoid, and one that happens anyways. You're never going to get a perfectly safe utopia while fishing on the ocean and this bill barely has any provisions that even address what you're talking about.

&gt;But well,let's ignore BBC and The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB),because they must be German Technocrats just wanting to give away UK sovereignty!
