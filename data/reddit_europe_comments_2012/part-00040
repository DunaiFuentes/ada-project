Obviously you can find exceptions to every trend, but the fact remains that universities that can generate more income will tend to be able to afford better resources (be it science labs, books for the library, extra staff....) and will thus perform better.  Of course funding level is not the only factor in delivering quality university-level education but, all other things being equal, having more funding will always be better than not having it.
  
Also, regarding Edinburgh in particular, [this telegraph article from 2010](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/indialenon/100033770/edinburgh-universitys-admissions-policy-will-deprive-it-of-the-brightest-english-students/) says that over 40% of the students at Edinburgh come from England, and thus pay fees, which [the BBC have reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-14784810) will probably soon be charged at the £9,000 level.  That's equivalent to everybody paying £3,600 (currently those figures are, I believe, £1,800 and £720).  That's not a huge amount, especially before the changes come in, but it *is* extra funding.  So simply characterising Edinburgh University as a place that does not charge tuition fees is inaccurate.  
  
I certainly wouldn't advocate a US-style system, however, with families often having to save from the moment their kids are born just to get them into university.

The laic tradition involves cooking and eating various lamb-based dishes: [drob](http://despremoda.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/drob.jpg) (lamb's caul stuffed with the minced entrails and cooked in the oven), stufat (lamb's ribs cooked with green garlic and onion), lamb sour soup (ciorba), and of course 'roast' (thighs).

One may start the Easter meal with a shot of ţuica (plum brandy, 40-60°), but all that lamb goes well with red wine (I prefer Merlot, but Cabernet Sauvignon works as well, especially towards the end of the meal).

A strange (and lost) tradition is Horses' Easter, coinciding with Ascension, when horses were exempted from work and there was some sort of mass for the animals. It has survived in the expression 'At the Horses' Easter', meaning 'never'.

Also, Easter is next week... Yes, we are special :)

[1] The Romanian church comes from the Byzantine tradition, so the mass is - depending on the priests - a dramatic spectacle involving lots of elaborate singing, by priests dressed in ritual clothing, dascali (deacons?) and choir, not unlike opera, but with byzantine music.

Building up a credit rating is important, especially in countries (unlike Germany) which value home ownership (which is perhaps a problem, but it's a separate issue). Credit cards provide a good way to do that. They're easy to use, universally accepted and are safer than debit cards. To build up credit with your credit card does not require overspending. It requires paying your bills on time.

In Canada landlords can ask for permission for a credit report, but I've yet to come across a situation where they actually did ask. And really, in Germany landlords can basically ask for your first born due to insanely lop-sided tenancy laws.

Honestly I think the German mindset has set up a system which makes everyone irrationally terrified of credit cards. Yes, of course you can overspend with them, yes you could fuck everything up. But that's a reflection of the person, not the device. If you don't want to use them, that's fine. Everyone has their own approach to personal finance. But I find the outright repulsion in this country mind-boggling.

Being a mostly conservative country, a lot of people people go to the church. Each church makes an epitaph of jesus, extravagantly decorated with flowers and some people go around churches to see those epitaphs. On Saturday midnight - Sunday, we light candles with ""holy light"" from the church. Later, we usually have lunch with the relatives, in which we hit a dyed egg with each other's in a contest for the last egg standing uncracked.

Children/teenagers light big bonfires (λαμπρατζιά) - in empty dirt fields or school football fields but this custom is ...controversial, to the say the least, because of the fire risk ;)

was mir aber immer wieder hier auffällt, ist, dass ihr euch nicht mit der art der kritik auseinandersetzt. das beginnt bei dem, was grass gesagt hat und endet bei solch unsäglichen beleidigungen wie von odatas. es geht darum, dass die aussagen grass eben keine sachliche kritik sind, sondern anschuldigungen, die einfach gelogen sind. er redet von auslöschung, atomkrieg und gefährdung des weltfriedens. der letzte, der diese worte inflationär nutzte, war adolf hitler. damals sagten auch viele deutsche, dass endlich mal die wahrheit ausgesprochen wurde.

in der antisemitismusforschung heisst es ""antisemismus ist ein gerücht"". man beschuldigt die juden pauschal bestimmter verbrechen, ohne sie beweisen zu können und ohne überhaupt einen grund dafür zu haben. das begann mit vorurteilen wie ""wucherer"", ""ausbeuterer"", ""ritualmörder"", ""verschwörer"" und ""heimliche weltherrscher"" im mittelalter und gingen weiter bei hitler, der paradoxerweise dem weltfinanzjudentum die schuld am ersten und zweiten weltkrieg gab. 

wenn ich nun den beitrag odatas lese, sieht man genau diese antisemitischen gerüchte: israel sei ein pickel am arsch der welt (den man in logischer konsequenz entfernen muss), der zum problem wird (wo wird israel zum problem für uns? und ist nicht viel mehr der iran das problem?)-  und seit wann schlachtet israel ohne ende palästinenser ab? die deutschen schlachteten ohne ende juden ab, das stimmt, aber wo sind die belege für solche aussagenwie von odata? es ist schlichtweg eine lüge, eine umkehr der tatsachen, die man zuletzt in dieser schärfe wann betrachten konnte? richtig, unter hitler, der das finanzjudentum für alle probleme der erde verantwortlich machte. die konsequenzen kennt ihr, weswegen ich an alle plädiere, ihren verstand zu benutzen und sich nicht von der krankheit des antisemitismus anstecken zu lassen. denn wir deutschen haben schonmal bewiesen, dass unser land ganz schnell zur wirklichen gefahr für die menschheit wird.

That's my point. This is the rock and the hard place that capitalism sticks us between. It's the choice between the Devil and the deep sea. But this needn't be the case at all, if the industry were nationalised we could automate the work and maintain our productivity, and so educate these people to do work that truly requires humans, thus increasing our total productivity and subjecting no-one to a dull life of meaningless labour.

You are stuck thinking still within the current system, when there is no law that things need be run this way at all.

Well I agree with you on intellectual property, but within capitalism this is a necessary evil to make it profitable. 

How else would drug research, etc. be profitable?

Non credi nel solstizio invernale ?
A te che te frega se un branco di pirla ha deciso che è la nascita del loro eroe dei fumetti preferito?
Cmq anche io sono uno che si fa le proprie tradizioni. Non mi piacciono quelle imposte dalla società, ma le adatto a mio uso e consumo.

&gt; Senza contare che trovo deleterie le tradizioni per l'essere umano, proprio come concetto.

mah, sono parzialmente d'accordo. Penso che le tradizioni possano essere positive e negative. Sono uno strumento. è naturale per l'essere umano, solo o in gruppo, di crearsi tradizioni. Può essere il cappuccino la mattina nello stesso bar, o il meeting annuale con i tuoi vecchi amici, o la festa del villaggio per il raccolto. Le tradizioni hanno svolto un ruolo importantissimo nel tramandare conoscenza tra i vecchi e i giovani, quando non c'era la scuola. Lo stesso ciclo scolastico è, tutto sommato, una tradizione. Non sono contro le tradizioni, sono contro un abuso dei messaggi delle tradizioni.


&gt; Tu dici che l'uomo necessita di festività (e di conseguenza di tradizioni), ma io sono del parere opposto, ovvero che siano i punti fermi a rovinare le persone.

Se vieni da una società coccolata come la nostra, posso credere che tu possa pensarla così, ma se venissi da una società in cui non sai se sopravviverai il prossimo inverno perchè non sai se il raccolto andrà a buon fine, o se ci sono venti di guerra e forse le armate travolgeranno il tuo duro ma relativamente quieto vivere, inizi a sentire il bisogno di qualcosa di certo, di piccole cose che ti danno un po' di gioia.

Non so quanti anni hai, ma quello che ti posso dire è che durante i 20 e i 30 hai voglia di metterti in gioco, ed è giusto così. Passato quel periodo, inizi a dire ""ok, ho fatto esperimenti, ora che voglio fare, dove voglio mettere radici?"" A volte puoi essere chiamato a nuovi cambiamenti, ma è sempre più difficile effettuarli, sia perchè puoi trovarti con una massa maggiore (famiglia, casa, mutuo), sia perchè riciclarti richiede tempo (e quindi soldi) che potresti non avere, e anche quando l'hai fatto, non è certo tu sia competitivo contro una persona giovane di pari qualifiche.
   
&gt; Le ""ricorrenze"" (in quanto ricorrono), danno un senso di sicurezza fittizio, sono la giustificazione all'immobilismo mentale.

No, non sono d'accordo. Un eccesso di esse, certamente. Piccole tradizioni sono piacevoli. Certo, bisogna guardare avanti, e arrendersi o fossilizzarsi nella tradizione è deleterio. In verità, la ""tradizione"" cambia. Son certo che se andassi a guardare come si festeggiava il Natale 100, 200, 1000 o 2000 anni fa, vedresti tradizioni completamente sconosciute, come da noi i ""babbi natale"" alle finestre son comparsi e scomparsi nel giro di pochi anni. 

&gt; Sono piccole cose, ma sono la base per la staticità nel resto.

So cos'è la questione meridionale, è una problematica sociale e culturale molto articolata e profonda che qualcuno sostiene addirittura avere radici nel medioevo, non si limita a ""al sud c'è criminalità e inciviltà"". Il punto è che ridurre un'intera città, o un'intera società, a delle caratteristiche negative (anche se vere, ovviamente) non serve alla discussione e, personalmente, mi fa solo pensare che tu preferisca giudicare piuttosto che capire o discutere, al punto che la prima reazione istintiva è dire una banalità (o quella che dovrebbe essere una banalità) del tipo ""ma i napoletani non sono certo tutti così"".  
Probabilmente non ti rendi neanche conto di quanto puoi risultare odioso e di quanto la tua leggerezza nello scrivere queste cose su Internet possa ferire, o di come paradossalmente atteggiamenti come quello che tu hai mostrato in questi commenti favoriscano quelle cattive condotte che tu condanni.  
È facile dire che ci sono molti cittadini disonesti a Napoli, che la criminalità spicciola è diffusa  eccetera (non sono neanche opinioni, ma fatti ovviamente), ma è più difficile cercare di fare qualcosa con queste informazioni: perché il napoletano medio (prendo il napoletano come esempio solo perché siamo in tema), soprattutto di determinati quartieri, è più facile che finisca coinvolto con la criminalità di un bolognese medio? È perché geneticamente ci sono differenze tra i due? È perché ""tanto si sa che i napoletani sono fatti così, che ci vuoi fare""? O è perché, ad esempio, una costante assenza dello Stato in certe zone disagiate spinge le persone a doversi ""arrangiare"" per sopravvivere, facendo così aumentare la criminalità e allontanando lo Stato in una spirale perversa? Non ci sarebbe neanche il bisogno di dirlo, ma questa non vuole essere una giustificazione di un comportamento malavitoso, bensì un tentativo di interpretazione, da cui dovrebbe poi nascere un intervento mirato -- che non è una passeggiata, come è evidente.

Neither in Europe nor Canada nor the US is a true free market system practiced, nor can it be with the respective legislative bodies being allowed to regulate the economic sphere without end.

Through capitalism, we can get to a post scarsity age (through growth), but we cannot do it if we waste money on regualting everything from how we fish (in the EU), to what language signs are to be in store shops (in Canada) to what health insurance must cover (in the US). When we divert our economy to regulating it, our economy slows down.

It is only when the state gets its boot off of the neck of the economic sector that our productive capablity can take off, where workers get paid more in real wages, and profit margins shrink (because of sweet sweet cutthroat compeition).

Your point, as best I understand it is why fool around with growth, when the government can order the creation of automation, and move us to an economy to that depends on intellectual rather than physical skills? 

Well doing a rather large reorganization is of course bad in the short term, as all economic changes are. In the long term, having a system run by the government is bad for the long term. This is because this is the same thing as a monopoly, a system that is not regulated by the profit and loss cannot be sensative to the needs of the consumer. But before I go too much into this, and attack a system that has not been fully defined to me, I would like to ask you:
a) how ownership works
b) how is this diffrent or superior to a monopoly.
c) any ideas on how to solve the problem of determining what the people want better than capitalism.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Through capitalism, we can get to a post scarsity age (through growth),

But how? When the entire system depends upon scarcity? I mean look at automation for an example with labour, where if everything is automated within capitalism there would be mass unemployment and economic collapse. So instead, automation happens and increases unemployment slightly, which in turn lowers wages until an equilibrium is reached where it is cheaper to employ human labour to do the tasks again and not invest in machinery. But this wastes human potential and holds our society back.

It should be obvious that there is no profit to be made from abundance. If gold were to fall from the sky tomorrow, so that it took no labour to obtain it, for it was in abundance in every location, then it would not be worth a dollar in exchange.

This idea that capitalists are separate from the state is absurd - on the contrary, usually the capitalists go to the state for protection. To enforce their private property rights with police and the army for example, or to enforce ""intellectual property"" and maintain artificial scarcity.

&gt;But before I go too much into this, and attack a system that has not been fully defined to me, I would like to ask you: a) how ownership works b) how is this diffrent or superior to a monopoly. c) any ideas on how to solve the problem of determining what the people want better than capitalism.

Government ownership is not the same as a capitalist monopoly, for so long as the government is democratic, then it is not at the whims of an individual, and nor does it benefit an individual. The needs of the consumer are still observed in the demand for goods, meanwhile open sharing of ideas and research allows rapid innovation. There's no reason one couldn't use programmes like Kickstarter to gauge possible demand.

I do not suggest abolishing currency at all, but rather nationalising industry and paying all people an equal share of the national product, in exchange for a certain amount of minimum mandatory work. So in the consumer market, the currency still functions as a measure for demand.

Meanwhile the production would be managed from this, with the use of computers. [_Towards A New Socialism_ (PDF)](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/new_socialism.pdf) chapters 3-10 covers this in detail. But there is no necessity for a commodities market in the production system (i.e. what would now be considered business-business).

On the other hand, it solves many problems which capitalism faces. Such as recessions due to apparent overproduction (as we always produce more commodities than can ever be profitably sold in total, effectively creating a game of musical chairs which builds up). [This chapter and it's follower, in _Equality_ cover this well](http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/equal10h.htm#22) (22 and 23, unfortunately they are quite long).

&gt;Drug Research: The drug companies can give up thier money before hand or the research lab can use a contract to keep thier information secret until they develop the drug. In a free property owning society contract law is like rope- if you can figure a creative way of arraging it, it hold together a lot more than you think.

But this means that medical research could not be shared for decades, in order to keep drugs manufacturing profitable. We'd effectively be going back to the days of trade secrets which was exactly what the patent system was created to avoid. This is not a good solution for society, especially when you consider we could nationalise the industry and just fund the research nationally - then we can share the results, and produce drugs as cheaply as possible.",0,1333922232,null,0,false,0,c49xwru,t3_rzagv,t1_c49xwru,t1_c49x1ul,null,1428680829,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I am saying outlaw the protection- down with state capitalism- a limited government designed only to ensure the consumer is not coerced and not lied too, should be the only connection between government and the economic sphere.

Second Section:
If the government sets the prices, what good is the currency?

If there is no compeition for labor, how can the laborer get the best deal (If I was on the labor end of that equation, I would want to be paid more for working against profits that are given to all)?

Also the big question is how can democracy work better than ownership? A group resource encourages the present to work against the future, while an owned resource encourages it's preservation for the future (this is the tragedy of the commons).

Overproduction is caused by increase in the credit supply, typically caused by the central bank. When there is larger money supply than need be (which can be caused by credit expansion) the capitalists will invest into the ecnonomy to make things that the average person will not be willing to buy, because they do not have enough money.

true,I_read_a_lot,null,null,"&gt;So cos'è la questione meridionale, è una problematica sociale e culturale molto articolata e profonda che qualcuno sostiene addirittura avere radici nel medioevo, non si limita a ""al sud c'è criminalità e inciviltà"". Il punto è che ridurre un'intera città, o un'intera società, a delle caratteristiche negative (anche se vere, ovviamente) non serve alla discussione e, personalmente, mi fa solo pensare che tu preferisca giudicare piuttosto che capire o discutere

C'è poco da capire e discutere. la gente là loda l'inciviltà. L'ho visto con i miei occhi.

&gt; ""ma i napoletani non sono certo tutti così"".

Non tutti, ma la società locale è intrappolata in un equilibrio di Nash decisamente scadente.

&gt;Probabilmente non ti rendi neanche conto di quanto puoi risultare odioso e di quanto la tua leggerezza nello scrivere queste cose su Internet possa ferire

eh vabbè, te la porti a casa, e si spera forse chiederti se è sempre colpa degli altri che dicono cose spiacevoli. Forse sarebbe ora di pensare che se qualcuno dice cose spiacevoli, è meglio risolvere i punti che solleva.

&gt; o di come paradossalmente atteggiamenti come quello che tu hai mostrato in questi commenti favoriscano quelle cattive condotte che tu condanni.

Quindi dire a uno che sbaglia e che fa delle porcate gli fa fare più porcate ? secondo quale logica ?

&gt; È facile dire che ci sono molti cittadini disonesti a Napoli, che la criminalità spicciola è diffusa eccetera (non sono neanche opinioni, ma fatti ovviamente), ma è più difficile cercare di fare qualcosa con queste informazioni: perché il napoletano medio (prendo il napoletano come esempio solo perché siamo in tema), soprattutto di determinati quartieri, è più facile che finisca coinvolto con la criminalità di un bolognese medio?

Equilibrio di Nash.

&gt; È perché geneticamente ci sono differenze tra i due?

Certamente, ma non è ascrivibile alla situazione civile, o se lo è, è difficile dimostrarlo.

&gt; È perché ""tanto si sa che i napoletani sono fatti così, che ci vuoi fare""? O è perché, ad esempio, una costante assenza dello Stato in certe zone disagiate spinge le persone a doversi ""arrangiare"" per sopravvivere, facendo così aumentare la criminalità e allontanando lo Stato in una spirale perversa?

Senti, la fame l'abbiamo fatta anche noi al nord. Ma noi ci siamo tirati su le maniche. Al sud si è preferito vivere di rent-seeking disonesto.

&gt; Non ci sarebbe neanche il bisogno di dirlo, ma questa non vuole essere una giustificazione di un comportamento malavitoso, bensì un tentativo di interpretazione, da cui dovrebbe poi nascere un intervento mirato -- che non è una passeggiata, come è evidente.

Il tempo delle chiacchiere è finito, e quando si passa ai fatti, il risultato è sassaiole contro le forze dell'ordine. Quando la gente del sud viene al nord fa un casino, butta bottiglie per strada, urla di continuo. Ma che cazzo hanno sempre da urlare ? 

&gt;Detto questo, per onor di cronaca, non solo non sono di Napoli, ma non mi è mai neanche piaciuta particolarmente come città o come ambiente, ma non per questo mi sento meno urtato dalle tue parole.

* I gather what you are talking about is a source of labor running out- economies that collapse because the corporations aren't hovering over the area, providing jobs. Usually poor regions have that are mineral rich have short sighted thugs for government officials that take the money from the corporation as if they are qualified to represent the people, and the land (because the land hasn't been given to private individuals, or it has been taken up by the government), and take from the people their property using flimsily legal justification, such as not having a deed, when no deed system had been set up by the government. 
Under capitalism he who has can get more, and he who does not have cannot get... but the good news of capitalism is that in order to have and to get more, one only needs protection of their property rights. How sad is it for those who do not have such basic protections, I hope one day that can change in Africa. I think it says a lot that the continent with the least respect for property rights is also the most poor.

The fact is you do not change from an energy model to another in years.
It took one century and several revolutions to get from wood+animal force to coal+steam.
Transition to oil was far smoother but was accompanied by strong state presence (see standard oil).


And yes governments will do a far better job. I haven't heard of any oil company concerned with greenhouse gas emission, the states are somewhat.
Why do you think there are subsidies for solar panels or windmills ? Because no one would not invest anything but a symbolic value otherwise.

See another (more obscure) example : phosphorus. It is absolutely vital for the agriculture : fertilizers are basically phosphorus and nitrogen. Nitrogen is not quite likely to be scarce one day (as roughly 80% of the air you breath is made of it) but phosphorus is (it is mined).
Today's (ie last 200 years) agriculture just can not produce as much as it does without phosphorus. When it will run out there will be a need for a massive growth of the agricultural sector.
Do you really think fertilizer companies are going to anticipate this ? Do you really think they are going to tell their customers to buy less of their production so as to make the transition as smooth as possible ?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I am saying outlaw the protection- down with state capitalism- a limited government designed only to ensure the consumer is not coerced and not lied too, should be the only connection between government and the economic sphere.

How would you actually achieve this though? When the wealthy corporations have such huge resources to undermine the government, and you still believe their property rights are just.

&gt;Second Section: If the government sets the prices, what good is the currency?

The currency can be tied to time worked, in production and consumption.

&gt;If there is no compeition for labor, how can the laborer get the best deal (If I was on the labor end of that equation, I would want to be paid more for working against profits that are given to all)?

Well, there is no individual negotiation, as there is no capitalist who is keeping the excess from unpaid wages. So, in effect, the rate of wages paid (i.e. of consumption against national investment) would be set by the democratic government.

&gt;Also the big question is how can democracy work better than ownership? A group resource encourages the present to work against the future, while an owned resource encourages it's preservation for the future (this is the tragedy of the commons).

Because the marginal benefit to the individuals is small, and so people are usually responsible. Consider how most people wish to protect the environment, because the benefit to their children is more important to them than the few more dollars they'd make if the profits were shared. This is only not the case when you have centralised power, as in capitalism, and so the few shareholders reap all the benefits whilst sharing the negative side of environmental damage.

My point is, the Tragedy Of The Commons requires individual benefit from a communal resource. If instead there is only communal benefit from the communal resources then people will weigh up the benefits in the future as well.

Meanwhile you are ignoring the practical and moral problems of mass privatisation. Why should we privatise the oceans when they were not created by any man, what right do they have to monopolise them? Would you also privatise the air itself?

To quote _The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists_:

&gt;\`Whether it can be altered or not, whether it's right or wrong, landlordism is one of the causes of poverty,'

&gt;[...]

&gt; \`It's caused by Private Monopoly. That is the present system. They have monopolized everything that it is possible to monopolize; they have got the whole Earth, the minerals in the Earth and the streams that water the Earth. The only reason they have not monopolized the daylight and the air is that it is not possible to do it. 

&gt;If it were possible to construct huge gasometers and to draw together and compress within them the whole of the atmosphere, it would have been done long ago, and we should have been compelled to work for them in order to get money to buy air to breathe. And if that seemingly
impossible thing were accomplished tomorrow, you would see thousands of people dying for want of air--or of the money to buy it--even as now thousands are dying for want of the other necessities of life. 

&gt;You would see people going about gasping for breath, and telling each
other that the likes of them could not expect to have air to breathe
unless they had the money to pay for it. Most of you here, for instance, would think and say so. Even as you think at present that it's right for so few people to own the Earth, the Minerals and the Water, which are all just as necessary as is the air. In exactly the same spirit as you now say: \`\`It's Their Land,'' \`\`It's Their Water,'' \`\`It's Their Coal,'' \`\`It's Their Iron,'' so you would say \`\`It's Their Air,'' ``These are their gasometers, and what right have the likes of us to expect them to allow us to breathe for nothing?''

&gt;Overproduction is caused by increase in the credit supply, typically caused by the central bank. When there is larger money supply than need be (which can be caused by credit expansion) the capitalists will invest into the ecnonomy to make things that the average person will not be willing to buy, because they do not have enough money. 

I don't see why it requires an expansion in credit, you could have no credit system at all and competing businesses will eventually reach this point. Because fundamentally people are paid less than the sale price of the products they produce (so the capitalists take their profits), and so this is why a sweatshop worker can spend all week making shoes, and yet not earn enough to afford even a pair of them at the end of the week. Because this is true in every line of work (it has to be or the employment would not be profitable) eventually the mass market will produce more than it can consume (of course, this can be offset by investing in a luxury market to cater to the capitalists who are absorbing the profits).

&gt;Third section: I'll be honest I've not thought too much about information which has utility beyond its knowing, but what I do know is that the other type of information, such as music should not be copyrighted.

Yeah, I mean with music it's quite clear copyright is mostly unnecessary as they could easily make a living otherwise anyway. But I consider scientific research to be the more important and worrying case, as there are huge problems with the current system, and yet also huge problems with trade secrets.

IIRC it's against the extreme regulation of income.

But our argument is not with the past of capitalism, but its future.

You can cross Paris in roughly 30 minutes with the metro, so pretty much anywhere inside the périphérie is decent, some places are of cause in nicer neighborhoods than others.

About the things you have mentioned. some of them can be very time consuming, and since you are only in the city for 2 days, then I think you are better off doing a very light version of some of them, or skipping them completely.

Here is my take on the things you have mentioned:
Normandy is nice for what it is. Long and wide beaches, it can be windy, but is nice for just taking relaxing strolls and seeing a bit of country side. It is of cause quite touristy, but I didn't not recall it to be too awful. I can't help feel like this day would be better spend inside Paris, since you are only spending a total of 3 days in France.

Pretty much every major tourist attraction in Paris is going to be very crowded, so you have to be aware of that, and plan a lot of time for standing in queue etc.

Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower you can see fast if you don't want to go inside same for the Arc de Triumph. I don't know how into these sorts of things you are, but I would say they are overrated unless this is a big deal for you.

Catacombs I haven't visited, since there was quite a queue the one day I tried going there.

The Louvre is massive, and dependent on what day you go there, the queue can be huge. I believe it is free one Sunday or Saturday per month, but don't go there that day, since it is going to be a nightmare. 
The Louvre is split into different genres, pick the one you are most interested in and go see that. The amount of art is massive, and it will take you weeks to see it all.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"It's a difficult question to answer. I think the structural imbalances are caused by three reasons: 

1. Technological know-how. 
2. Scale of operations. 
3. Geographical positioning and miscellaneous geopolitical issues. 

So, we have to answer two questions. First, would any reasonable amount of EU funds help alleviate these imbalances? Second, assuming that such amount exists, were the amounts given to net recipient countries greater or equal to it? 

For the first question, I have some intuition that it's probably difficult for countries like Greece to compete on equal terms with countries like Germany and the like. Sums of money cannot really give you the technological know-how that was gained by centuries worth of industrialisation. In addition, Greece will almost certainly never be able to fund colossal mega-corporations that have the scale of operations that ING, Siemens, Bayer etc have. Finally, a geographical position may give a country a big advantage: For instance, take the Netherlands' position as a trade route or Norway's oil. It's hard to imagine that the comparative advantages and disadvantages of all countries in this respect could become completely balanced. 

The cases of Spain and Ireland are a bit problematic. The amount of money given is a function of GDP right? How do you know that the GDP of Ireland or Spain will not deflate in the future because it was driven by the pre-crisis credit-fuelled bubble? I'd wait a few years before making that claim about them becoming net contributors. 

Even if they do become net contributors, there are some special circumstances surrounding them that make their comparison with Portugal and Greece somewhat unfair: Spain is a big country so even if it does not have the technology, it can still maintain a big scale of operations for some industries. Ireland, on the other hand, ""cheated"" its way into the big club by becoming a tax haven for big multinationals. Ireland's relative success cannot be replicated because if everyone did what they do it would create a race-to-the-bottom for tax revenues that would ultimately be bad for everyone.",0,1333966266,null,0,true,0,c4a4fu7,t3_rz0gj,t1_c4a4fu7,t1_c4a42ge,null,1428683980,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Meanwhile most research and the like is currently not well paid. But people do it because it is more interesting than meaningless work stacking shelves in supermarkets, etc. and this would continue, even if you were just to equalise wages with no increase in productivity, you would get ~£35k each according to G.A. Cohen's book _Why Not Socialism?_. This would itself be a significant increase over most PhD salaries in any case, and once you have a certain amount of money, it's the time and freedom that really matter.

Once people are provided with the necessities of life, then the most important motivation will be pride and the feeling of contribution to society. I mean, even within the capitalist system when there is every motivation against it, we still see acts of charity and kindness.

People will continue to do research for pride, fame and meaning just as they do now. And we would be capable of greatly increasing the numbers of people who are able to be educated (by automating work and eliminating redundant work), thus increasing productivity.

I also agree that the best way to tackle the Louvre is pick a subject that interests you and really focus on those galleries.

Also, consider checking out the smaller, thematic museums. The Musée d'Orsay is definitely more manageable, as is Beaubourg if you're into more contemporary stuff. Personally, I'm a huge fan of the Musée Gustave Moreau, if you'd like to see one artist's massive studio and gallery.

(including the number 1 line which will get you to a lot of the main attractions pretty easily)  There are also a lot of little bakeries and cafes near by that are fairly good.  I'm not exactly sure what the price is, but it's not super expensive.  I think most of the rooms have a small kitchen in them, and they all have free wifi.  We've been here for just over a week so far and I really like it.  They also have this machine downstairs that has some pretty good hot chocolate, espresso, and coffee.  And it's free to use.  It really feels like we are right in the middle of everything though.  It's great.  So far, we've been able to just run back to the hotel every day for lunch because it's so conveniently located to all the stuff we have been doing.

I would say just go check out the eiffel tower, have a walk around it, don't waste your time standing in line to go up it.  If you want a view, go to the top of the Arc de Triumph.  It's a lot of steps, but so far we haven't seen a big line there.  And it's a better view.  Notre Dame won't take that long to go through if you get there early enough.  We left the hotel lobby around 9am the other day to go see it and there was no line.  However, when we came out, there was a pretty good line waiting to go in.  I think that's the key for things like that.  Get there early (8 or 9am) if you're going to want to go inside or whatever.  The lines seem like they move so slow here. Also get your tickets ahead of time if you can.  (Our hotel will print things for you for a few cents downstairs if you're buying tickets online for things)

The Louvre is absolutely enormous.  And so are the crowds, and of course the lines.  So be prepared for that.  It is easy to get lost in there.  I was just wondering around aimlessly in there the other day gawking at all of the art work and before I knew it, 3 and a half hours had passed me by.  If you know you will be here for 2-3 days and going to museums and such all of those days, I would recommend that you get a museum pass.  It is completely worth it if for no other reason than it will get you in without having to wait in all of those enormous ticket lines.  We had a 4 day pass last week and it was awesome.

Not early enough and it is not a good solution. Prices increase too late and too brutally.
Even if they did not it is far from optimal. Ideally which each mean of production would come its replacement, whose cost would lower until it is cheaper from ~years.

That way you will have a smooth transition. This is what happened when we switched from coal to oil (not because it was planned but because it turned out oil was better).

And this requires long-term planning, something that capitalistic companies just can't do (and which is in essence the complete opposite of free-market : prices would be artificially higher so that they would not increase too much)

If you take answers 1 &amp; 3.

Every society has jobs that need to be done, can't be easily automated and are basically a huge amount of hard work. Farming would be a good example, farming is massively more automated than it once was but it's still a huge amount of work on an individual level. 

Taking point 1, I simply say, I'm quite happy to do ""this particular job"", you say ""we have lots of people doing that job, more than we need!"", that's not my problem I say, that's the job I want to do.

But you say, ""we need more farmers"", ""I don't want to be a farmer though""

How do you get people to be a farmer if they don't want to be? The answer is you have to pay them more or reward them in some other way and once you do that you effectively are back to square one.

Your system works in a world where humans aren't capable of destructive emotions, jealousy, greed, resentment but that's not the world we live in, every time socialism/communism has been tried it has failed because it has been undermined by human nature, capitalism continues to thrive because it accounts for and harnesses those aspects of human nature in a way that ultimately raises the standard of living for everyone.

It's usually about £13-15k annually for a PhD, and about £25k or so for a post-doc position, this is in Physics in the UK. You could earn the same working in a supermarket, and whilst professors are quite well paid, that'd be like saying the military is well paid based on a survey of Field Marshalls.

Industry-related work does pay slightly better, but I don't know how close you can get to military research, etc. and still believe it is in the public interest.

I agree with you that STEM-subjects are more important, although the line is often not clear. For example, I study physics, mostly work in programming (simulating graphene for my Masters' dissertation), and yet am also working in Biopsychology/neuroscience for an internship. Does this ""psychology"" count as STEM or not? It can be hard to draw the line so clearly.

Similarly, history can be very important, as is linguistics especially as the latter is very related to psychology and neuroscience. Many of these fields apply scientific methods, so I think it's a bit juvenile to try and class it as ""non-scientific"" versus ""scientific"". That said, I would certainly agree there is an overabundance of English, Media Studies, and Business students.

Australians/austrians are actually mistook for one another quite often by less educated people, same goes for slovak/slovene. There lies the problem with this naming of gypsies as romani. Now whenever gypsies steal/lie/con people and the deed is in the media, lesser educated people automatically  think about romanians. And please, don't tell me this isn't the case, ask the average italian/french what he thinks of romanians. You see, as opposed to gypsies being mistaken for romanians, being mistaken for an australian as an austrian leads to nothing but probably a funny blunder.

&gt; What was Romania's ""ethnicity agenda""? 

Romania was treating gypsies as per usual. No free handouts, no free land, no free university scholarships. They were slowly forcing them to obey civic rules and adapt to our society. Removing slumps, putting begging children in orphanages, etc.

 Is it a bad idea in general to move so far forward as these non-capitalist parties wish to, without having a very large majority?  if only the bear-minimum majority were in support, then the large minority in opposistion of the people could emigrate and take their capital with them before emigration taxes would have time to be put in place - and plus without a large majority, how can a system make drastic changes without some degree of authoritarianism?

Isn't democracy just a bad way to go about getting rid of capitalism since those with capital would be able to see the changes coming and be able to emigrate with their capital before emigration taxes were put in place - taking with them enough capital to have a negative impact on the people?

Thus, isn't more effective to wait until enough people truly hate the capitalists and so they go and just take over the capital for themselves? or a revolution rather.

My sister lived in Hungary for a year, where they do have the highest taxes in europe outside of northern europe - and everytime her and her fiance needed something repaired he would ask ""do you need papers"" meaning ""do you want to pay taxes"" - if only a simple majority is behind the change, isn't mass tax evasion also an issue?

Hey, it wasn't just that, it was never that black and white. Everyone acted like barbarians back in the XVI century, we just became more powerful than everyone else, though not necessarily more cruel.

For example, here next to the Mediterranean there were occasionally raiding parties by [Barbary corsairs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_corsairs) whose purpose was to capture Europeans to sell them as slaves in Africa.

And when you talk about destruction of entire cultures, just keep in mind while the Spanish were never a nice bunch when it came to the age of the discoveries, the other people weren't that nice as well, let me remind you that the Aztecs performed gory human sacrifices on a daily basis for ages until we Europeans arrived there and nearly exterminated them all with our diseases and war, and even in that conflict it was some hundred Spanish and an entire army of natives who despised the Aztecs versus the Aztecs themselves.

Je ne crois pas que cette élection fasse exception : un fort taux d'abstention va donner l'impression d'un FN fort.

Yes, it's the only viable option really. Only Thalys links Cologne and Paris directly. In fact, almost all continental European connections are served by monopolies.

Alternatively you can catch an IC or ICE to Karlsruhe or Stuttgart and take a TGV or ICE from there, but you'll pay more and take twice as long.

I don't know about night trains. There might well be a direct one between Cologne and Paris. They can be cheaper and they're always good fun.

As such neither party claimed sovereignty over the area, but allowed each other to partake of the fur trade in the area, which was extremely lucrative at the time, as well as to send in settlers.

In practice, it was the U.S. side that wound up flooding the area with settlers in the 1840s (via the Oregon Trail). The 1846 treaty then established the current boundary at the 49th Parallel.  

Thus although it's true that Great Britain in fact claimed the area, and had agents there that reported to the Hudson Bay Company, they never established a true colony there.

Japan industrialized much more quickly than the rest of Asia, and as such, became the first non-European great power alongside the United States. For much of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, they were the most powerful country in Asia.

The Korean Peninsula and much of Northern China were under the influence of Imperial Japan, coupled with a strong Chinese identity, the widespread belief that their culture was superior to Europe's, and the geographic complexity of colonizing inner China explains why some areas of China were never colonized.

Thailand resisted colonization through widespread modernization efforts and it also served a practical purpose a a buffer between British India and French Indochina.

Afghanistan is a geopolitical nightmare to try and conquer, though it was influenced to a degree by the British presence in Pakistan.

true,nathanjosephcole,UNSA,United States,"&gt;How would you actually achieve this though? When the wealthy corporations have such huge resources to undermine the government, and you still believe their property rights are just.

You make a government the way that the EU should've built their government. Instead of establishing it's authority, and then getting democratic legitimacy, the EU government should've made a government that had democratic legitimacy, but could only do a few things (like enforcing a free trade agreement or providing a unified police service) The government could only act in those areas wherein it had power.

Start with a parliament, and an elected version of the European Commission. Allow these bodies to only make rules regarding a small list of powers (like synchronizing police agencies, and enforcing the EFTA). Allow this government to work within this narrow range of powers. When the government wants to expand its power, it should require the approval of 2/3 of the peoples of Europe with 50% in 3/4 of the member states (and make reversing this bestowal of power only dependent on getting a 50% majority vote in order to do so). This way only that which the government of the EU has widespread approval for, the government can do, and it cannot do stupid things like giving idiotic subsidies to large corporations. It is the government actions that give tax payer money the private businesses in order to ""manage the economy"" that is evil, not owning these businesses. 

Of course the EU didn't do that, it is the kind of government that would put pictures of buildings on their money, and build the buildings later.

On the morality of the Ownership of Space:
If you suppose that the individual had no right to own land, why would the government have a right to own it either? Land has to be owned. Without the ability of some to deny the use of space to others, no food would grow. What makes it more moral that the land be owned by the government, which never pays taxes on it, than the individual who does if asked?

On the cause of overproduction:
The reason why it has to be caused by the expansion of credit, is under the natural system, wherein interest rates are regulated by the amount of money saved in the banks, and prices are freely set by the private sector, is that when products don't sell, their prices go down, allowing for the economy to readjust. They cannot do that with the ECB, the Bank of England or the FED regulating the money supply.",0,1334029020,null,0,true,0,c4aflnw,t3_rzagv,t1_c4aflnw,t1_c4a48u4,null,1428689439,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I'm not sure which hostels you've looked at already or what your travel dates are but I highly recommend a hostel called Equity Point Centric.

http://www.equity-point.com/en/component/reserves/view/lay/widget/53?LanguageId=1&amp;year=2012&amp;month=5&amp;day=10&amp;nights=4&amp;beds=3&amp;unavailable=true&amp;locationId=382

We stayed there for the majority of the time we were in Barcelona. It's right on Passeig de Gracia, which has upscale shopping and restaurants which may not part of your travel plan, but it's extremely close to a metro stop which will take you anywhere. We stayed in a co-ed mixed ensuite and it was a nice way to meet people. Those also included lockers so you can lock up your stuff if you prefer. They charged us 3 euros (or something in that range) for sheets and towels but considering how cheap it is to stay, it's not that big of a deal. They also have a breakfast that I think was complimentary (if not it was built into what we paid upfront). 
Another nice thing was that they did a Flamenco and Tapas tour that the hostel sponsors. It was a little pricey, I think 20 euros per person, but that covered what we ate at the tapas bar, some drinks and the cover to see the flamenco performance. What the best part was in my opinion was that the guide was a local so he knew the flamenco performers we saw and then he knew all of the best clubs, where we got some drinks/shots free because he was friends with the owners. 
If the Point Centric doesn't have space for when you will be there, the other two hostels owned by the Equity group are also nice. It's up to you to decide whether the location is ideal though.

true,vtjohnhurt,UNSA,United States,"The problem for the Euro is that Germans produce more than they consume.  Germany is a net exporter.

One of the reasons that Germany is fiscally strong is because other members of the Euro zone have bought and can continue to buy lots of German exports.  If those 'weaker' countries had their own currencies, they would be devalued and the holders of those devalued currencies could purchase less of German exports.   Germany is a net exporter and therefore ""strong"".  If all the Euro countries became net exporters, then who would import the surplus production?  China?  USA?  The world economic slump is caused by excessive productive capacity (supply) that exceeds consumption (demand).  Until someone figures another way to balance the supply/demand equation, there needs to be a flow of tax dollars paid by Germans to the less productive countries like Greece that provide demand for Germany's excess production (supply).  The equation does not balance if all of the money flows into Germany and none of it flows out.

To sum it up as best as one can in a comment on the internet, divide your studying of the language into a few phases:

1. Pronunciation - learn how to say every sound as it would appear in french. By attacking this early, you can eliminate having a bad accent in the language later on.

2. Grammar - Go through a grammar textbook (I would recommend TeachYorurself), and learn the structure of the french language. It will require a decent amount of memorization, basically you have to understand how to operate the french language. This is similar to learning formulae to understand physics, or a computer code style to understand the computer language.

3.  Once you know the grammar, you can fill in the blanks. Basically just learn as much vocabulary as possible. Start with easy things, expand until you can form sentences (although you will probably still have a slight accent).

4. Read literature (there are many bilingual books), speak with natives of the language, watch films, etc. The last step is to completely immerse yourself in the culture. Any time you lax your development of the language, you will see immediate losses in vocabulary (even after a week you will loose your fringe knowledge).

*retour sur la hotte*

Je ne comprends pas exactement la nature de votre logement. Pour l'instant j'imagine un appartement dans une maison, pas dans un bâtiment de plusieurs étages. 

Qu'est ce qu'il y a au-dessus de vous ? Un autre appartement ou les [combles](http://www.news-menuiserie.com/img/photos/zoom/combles-03.jpg) ? 

Si les combles ne sont pas aménagés, *[combles aménagés](http://9a.img.v4.skyrock.net/9a4/gitenorella/pics/1624312844_small.jpg)*,  il serait facile de percer un trou, de connecter une [gaine](http://csimg.webmarchand.com/srv/FR/2904638848116/T/340x340/C/FFFFFF/url/gaine-accordacon-tenflex.jpg) sur la sortie de la hotte qui dépasse du meuble de la cuisine et de faire évacuer les odeurs/vapeurs de cuisson vers l'extérieur, par une bouche à installer soit sur le toit, soit au [mur](http://media.comprendrechoisir.com/public/image/public/studio/image/content/258553/mainImage-main-4307036.jpg). Sur la photo des combles aménagés en cuisine vous pouvez voir le tube de la hotte montant verticalement vers le toit, c'est une installation telle que je décris.

Ou sans doute il serait plus simple d'installer une [Ventilation mécanique](http://www.promotelec.com/media/image/Installation-de-ventilation-simple-flux-autoreglableok.gif) couvrant toute la maison...

En tout cas, appelez un artisan et écoutez ce qu'il propose comme solution(s). Un devis ne vous engage à rien, et cela vous donnerait une idée précise de la différence de prix dont je parlais plus haut.

In my view, the difference consists of:

- was there a stable, orderly regime beforehand?  If no, or it was only loosely affiliated tribal societies, that points towards ""colony"".  Examples of ""occupied countries"":  Ethiopia, German conquests in Europe in WWII.  Examples of colonies:  India under the Raj, Taiwan under the Japanese.
- did the occupation last for long enough for the occupying power to build up significant, lasting institutions, or did the occupying power see itself as a temporary ""guardian"" of sorts?  An example of the latter:  the US in the Philippines.
- did the occupying power make significant efforts to integrate the area into some form of long-term administrative / economic structures?  If yes, that points towards colony.  Examples of occupied territories:  Syria under the French, Namibia under the South Africans.  
- was the outside  territory considered an integral part of the occupying entity by at least a significant part of both the home country's and the outside territory's population?  If not, again that points towards ""colony"" (as opposed to a part that split off at some point rather than an occupied country.  An example of a non-colony here would be Slovakia under Czechoslovakia, or East Pakistan).

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Firstly, let's realise that the debt taken on by the Greek state are not solely done to enrich a homogeneous, distinct elite. The real picture is more complex, in that several over-lapping groups - from [unionised workers](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/8612737/Will-militant-unions-derail-big-fat-Greek-sell-offs-on-the-rocky-route-to-recovery.html) to those who dodge taxes - take a selfish view of the world, yet these people through one means or another form the majority of those who vote in elections and thus align themselves with parties that suit their interests.

The whole of society bears some fault, or collective guilt for the state of affairs because for one reason or another parties that have wanted to cut spending or rein in taxes have not lost. This self interest has harmed the wider society and evidently Greece (and others) lack the constitutional power to do what is in the interest of the whole.

The other issue is that people will never take responsibility for their actions when the can be very easily externalised (blame religion for this one). Bankers are one facet of the problem, they are not the *only* reason for the crisis, equally reading around on many of the subreddits if you switched ""rich"" for ""black"", ""Muslim"" or some other group you'd be called a racist. It seems that the rich are the only minority it is ok to hate on. 

This is not to say the ""rich"" are blameless, but punitive action and using them as a scapegoat for the failings of the rest of society are the moral equivalent of persecuting a minority.

But back to society more generally, we (Europe) must bear responsibility for the crisis because we allowed countries to be admitted to the eurozone and EU when they clearly were not ready. Any credible reading of Greece's economy before they joined showed that they did not meet the Maastricht criteria. Yet politically it was easier to ignore this and give the Greeks what they wanted...and why not money was cheap?

The sad thing is that all of this was very much avoidable, but no-one, least of all the Eurocrats were willing or able to confront reality. We are doing the same thing with Italy now. 

We all like to bash the Americans for their lack of general health care and weak social welfare, despite that they do spend more than people realise on those things, but we in Europe are living well beyond our means and no-one wants to accept it because who is going to vote for welfare cuts? or paying for health care services? Or accepting services must be cut?

No-one, unless it is forced upon us by an external agency (oh look, externalising blame again) in this case the EU in the form of technocratic governments. Cue riots.

All in all, the Greeks drew the short straw. It could well be Portugal or Ireland in their stead.

I use vélib' all the time, day and night, because it's less expensive than the metro and faster. Of course I always know where I'm going so I can be focused on the road and the drivers. Paris isn't a very bike friendly city and you'll have to share lanes with busses and taxis sometimes, but if you bike in Toronto I'm sure you know how to handle circulation and are aware of blind spots and stuff like that.  

There are two problems, that although minor, can be a hassle : Vélib' bikes are used by different people all the time and not everybody is respectful so you have to be careful before taking a bike, check the tires, brakes and pedals. Also the bikes are a little bit heavy, so if it's late and you have to bike up to Montmartre it can be a bit uncomfortable.  

Also stations are sometimes empty or full making it hard to park your bike, but you just have to look around there's a station approximately every 200 meters. Otherwise I think there's an Iphone app that tells you where the stations are and their vacancy.

Good advice about checking out the bike before you take it. I always check the tires and the chain (by picking up the back wheel and pedaling it forward) before I take a bike. That way, I wouldn't have to wait 5 minutes to get a new one if the bike is bad.

Also be aware that the informal method of showing a bad bike is by turning the seat backwards. If you see a bike at a stand with a green light and the seat is turned backwards, don't take it.

Es gibt wenig Ereignisse, die sich mit so hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit vorhersagen lassen wie dieses: Angriff auf den Iran == Obama war die längste Zeit Präsident.
