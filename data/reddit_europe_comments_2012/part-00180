1. Acroplis - and the brand new amazing museum that is located there. The floor in one area is see through and you look down on an ancient village area. Lots of amazing things in there. If you have never been to greece, and you love greek history then you must go there before going off to the islands. You just need 1 full day to experience it and the next day you can take a plane out of athens and onto the islands.

2. Island hopping - This is just a general tip. You can visit 4-5 islands in a week if you like and have a blast. Or just 1 island a week, up to you.

Now im just going to list some places to visit on my hometown island of Rodos.

Rhodes - A must go. My two favorite places in my hometown island are Rhodes City(capital) and Lindos. Inside Rhodes City you will find OLD TOWN. Old town or Palia Poli(greek) is a 1,000 year old Castle city in Perfect shape, built by the fleeing Knights templar of Jerusalem after there lost against the Islamic armies. It is a Massive castle city that Still houses over 5,000 people . . .some of the hottest Nightclubs and Bars in Rhodes are there. Absolute Party at night, its seriously amazing watching thousands of people dance in the clubs and on the street on thousand year old cobblestone rocks. And during hte daytime its a great place to visit to get some pictures, visit museums, and lots of high end boutique shops.

Lindos is the 3,000 year old ancient power center of Rodos, and the ancient castle still stands on top the hill. Crazy nightlife, And Lindos has what is considered the best beach on the island and top 5 beachs in all of Greece. The beach is as close to perfection as you could ever find on this planet.

SOme other notable places to visit in Rodos. 

Faliraki Waterpark - biggest water park in Greece I believe. really fun place to go with the family

Kremasti Kite Surfing - At kremasti beach during the summer. Just take a ride to the beach and you will find dozens if not close to a hundred people kite surfing. Ive seen people get Massive air. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitesurfing

Valley of the butterflies - My favorite hiking spot in Rodos, as you hike inside a cave/outside area you will see millions of butterflies, its an amazing experience.

There are ancient ruins scattered everywhere there, you can make an adventure by just renting a car/scooter and just exploring the island getting to the hard to find ones . . . lots of local village festivals going on, just ask a local where the current one is. . . 

And that is just one island out of hundreds.

If your at Rodos, go to the Rodos City harbor and take a quick boat ride to Halki(Xalki). its a tiny island 30-45 minute boat ride away that will take you to a different world and see how different life can be in Greece. It is an island so small no cars are legal to drive. There are only 150-200 permanent residents. I love going there and just relaxing.

I'd do the Boyne Valley.

Newgrange is pretty cool. It's got a great interpretive centre, built relatively recently.

The Brú na Boyne centre at Oldcastle and the other things in that area are pretty well developed tourist sites. Oldcastle/Brú na Boyne is a great place to visit as well. Its near the site of the Battle of the Boyne and demonstrates what life was like back then, and how the war war was fought.

Drogheda is pretty nice as well. Lived there for 4 years. St. Lawrence's Gate is one of the town's old gates and is still standing. Millmount is a old Martello tower restored and used as a museum of the towns past.

* [The archepelargo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_archipelago). Perhaps the most well known is the archepelargo of Stockholm, but you can find it further south/north, and on the west coast. Islands, thousands of them, thrown out in the Baltic. You can take a boat, sail or kayak between them. [Picture](http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/PageFiles/7380/Sankt_Anna.jpg)

* [Gotland](http://www.gotland.net/en). Beautiful big island in the Baltic. A very unique nature, with [stacks](http://www.astro.uu.se/~hoefner/pgal/pics/got_rauk7.jpg), mediveal town and a wonderful light. [Picture](http://ormmicke.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/gotland-dag-1-057.jpg)

* [Stockholm](http://www.visitstockholm.com/en/). The biggest town in Sweden, where you can visit the Vasa museum, go shopping or go to clubs. Did I mention it is built upon islands? [Picture](http://megafonen.nu/evelina/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/stockholm.jpg)

* [Dalarna](http://www.dalarna.se/en/Move-to-Dalarna/). A wonderful, magical part of Sweden.

British people have not been offered any sort of democratic choice on what the European Union has become, despite the fact that is has evolved into something almost unrecognisable since it was put to referendum in the 1970's. This has suppressed open dialogue, which is why you are seeing the emergence of a more affirmative heterodox movement emerging against the EU in my opinion. 

British people's concerns about immigration have been, for the most part, ignored. Large parts of East London are now only 15-20% White British. This is quite frankly a massive demographic change. London as a whole is no longer majority white British, only clocking in at around 45% at the recent census. Again, the British public was never offered a choice on this.

1. Lake Saimaa (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saimaa) in Eastern Finland during summer. ~~Rent~~ (forget that, just give me a call)  a summer cottage and have relaxing weekend fishing, swimming and going to sauna (bonus if you drink some Koskenkorva). http://static2.visitfinland.com/wp-content/uploads/MEK-LAPPEENRANTA-17_4583-930x523.jpg


2. Lapland during Winter. Landscape is just unreal and you just cant get bored seeing Aurora Borealis.

3. Helsinki. Lots of things you can do and see. I would prefer visiting during summer. For example Fortress of Suomenlinna (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suomenlinna). I just love hanging out with friends in some parks and walk around the city for whole night, because it really doesn't get totally dark at any point.

4. The old town of Porvoo. Very beautiful wooden houses, and you should drink a cup of coffee by Gulf of Finland.

5. Basically any National Park depending on how far north you want to travel. For example Repovesi, its about 130km from Helsinki.

Ps. I have always lived in southern Finland, so might be little bit biased

. 

Just my own ideas, but a lot of people in the south of Europe also seem happy about the thought of transferring more of the power to Brussels, since they think their own government is so corrupt (probably right, they know better than I, I am sure). I have never figured out really why the Finns,Dutch, Austrian etc, think it is such a grand idea to transfer all the power to the EU, but to each their own I suppose. 

Frankly, I don't even think they discuss it that much, the transfer of money or independence, at least it doesn't seem that way to me, but obviosly I do not spend my days reading Finnish/Dutch papers, so they will probably come in and correct me. 

Swedes as a rule are very sucspicious towards Brussel, we think (probably correct I might add, since we are one of the least corrupt countries, so at least statistically, our money are more likely to disappear when it goes to the south) our finances and deciscions are better handled by Swedes. We do not trust Brussels to spend wisely, or to make in a lot, or any deciscion, with our interest at heart. I think that goes hand in hand with what the British public think. However, there seems to be almost a populistic hatred towards the EU in the UK that I don't quite get, a harshness somehow. It seems like your politicians are almost competing with each other in being Euro sceptic, and I do think that is unnecessary. Everyone knows the UK's position anyway and no one (unlike us) is able to force you to do anything (apart from the US :-) ).

I don't think you should quit the EU just yet, I don't think you would do better outside, at least not unless you quitted with some other countries (some sort of northern/western union or something).Nor do I think you have to. Also, I prefer to have you in, it is nice to hear Cameron say the same things our politicians are saying, since people (naturally), listen to him a lot more.

Le néoliberalisme c'est l'idée que la libre concurence est la forme d'echange idéal pour **tous** les cas. la consequence imediate de cette conclusion, c'est que l'etat doit suprimer tous les services publiques pour ouvrir les marchés correspondant a la libre concurence.

Based on 1% giving one €, you only need a street frequented by 10000 people per day, and - given a usual working day of eight hours, about 1250 people per hour. A lot of places qualify for that kind of people moving. Given the usual tricks (""Wallet stolen, need to get fare for bus"") and picking your targets with some care, a lot more per successful contact can be achieved.

&gt; The people I know do not make 100 euros, or dollars in your case, per day by begging. Not even half of that.

Euros for me, thank you very much. Either way, your people need some training. Begging is a high-class work, and just sitting in a place and not doing anything will get you little no nothing. Beggars are entertainers, for much of the same reason you posted: The working class loves to have an actor giving them a false sense of superiority, something to look down upon and act generously towards.

So you could say that there is a position of (minor) power, but being in the Euro Currency these policies are having an effect on our own currency, so While we theoretically may have an advantage of being in the Eurozone, we will most likely agree with Germany anyway, as they have the same values, and this is about our currency.

Now, for the immediate future, what I would propose for Greece would be some kind of mixed economy, with all strategic industries back in the hands of the Government, re-opening of some factories that have closed down (like sugar) and some aggressive tourism policies (e.g. Legalising Marijuana/psychedelics and attracting drug tourism).  A strategic focus into reorganising agriculture via automation (so as to increase production to something like 200% of the population needs) and rolling out fiber cross-country (so that you can get people to move outside the big cities and get big construction projects rolling). You will also need government-to government discussion for getting oil (e.g. through Venezuela or Iran) - needless to say exciting EU, repudiating all debt and printing your own currency are compulsory for any effort like that.

It's a shame our country has such a ""nuclear arms"" style ""prevention by proliferation"" with regards to guns, but that's just how it is, and banning them now does NOTHING to help that situation other than put the people with illegal guns on a higher level.

Since the vast majority of gun crimes are in the poor inner city areas, by poor people who are involved in gangs, then they're already using illegal firearms, or have easy access to them. Other people though **benefit** from having a gun ban. You're keeping guns out of neighborhoods that would otherwise have them. The conneticut massacre could've easily been avoided. I doubt a middle-aged white woman will venture into the slums just to buy a firearm. Also, socially impaired/mentally disturbed people just don't have the social connections needed to have access to firearms.

You might argue that knife usage will increase but honestly, I'd much rather go against a guy with a knife than a guy with a gun.

true,la_pluie,null,null,"My boyfriend and I spent NYE at Disneyland Paris last year.. We arrived in the morning and left around nightfall so we could be at the Eiffel Tower for the midnight countdown. In retrospect, we should have stayed at Disneyland for more of a proper celebration. The Eiffel Tower was anticlimactic - no countdown, no fireworks, just a bunch of drunk people all celebrating at different times.

Disregard what dk58 said.. I'm such a proponent of Disneyland that I must insist that spending the day at the park CAN be romantic.. With a little bit of preparation :) 

I had gone to Disneyland Paris 3 other times that year and New Year's Eve was the least crowded day. Usually the park is filled with tour groups but that day it was just families and couples. You will need as much energy to last until midnight so you should sleep in that morning, have lunch at home or nearby, and arrive around 12 PM. If you're getting a park hopper pass, start off with Studio Park first because there's really only a handful of fun rides, so you might as well get them out of the way 

Between 3-4 is a good time to head over to Disneyland Park. Last year when I was there, they had a live band performance at the Hyperion Auditorium around that time. It was really relaxing to grab a hot snack (burgers are the fare there) and just listen to Christmas music.

An important tip is that as the evening stretches on, less and less people start to go on rides. (The kids start getting cranky while the parents begin to drop like flies). By 7-8PM, most lines aren't more than half an hour. Around 10, you can basically walk straight to the front.

However, by 11 you and your girlfriend should scout out a good place for fireworks viewing - if you can - get to the front of the castle! BRING A BIG THICK BLANKET! You two will be waiting outside in the cold for a while so this will be make your experience all the more pleasant (.. snuggling!). If you don't want to lug it around, just rent a locker in the beginning. It might be a bit expensive, but it's a worthy investment. And on that note... 4 of the 6 times I have gone to Disneyland Paris - it has rained (and these were all at different months). Bring an umbrella, wear rain boots or thick shoes, bring extra socks (waiting in lines all day in rain will have that effect), and a nice waterproof or well-insulated coat.

Finally.. I noticed last year that the Blue Bayou (restaurant in Pirate's of the Caribbean) offered a special NYE dinner. I don't remember the price but it was definitely over 50 euros per person. You need to reserve ahead of time though.

I use the Loop in St Louis as an example; it is a touristy place with bars and attractions that is, unfortunately, very close to a poor area. For several years, the area has struggled with people coming over from the poor area, attacking, mugging, etc., people going about their days. Now, while I'm not arguing that everyone should carry a gun, or that these scenarios wouldn't occur if people all had guns in their purses, but can you imagine the advantage the criminals would have if they knew it was illegal for the non-criminals to carry any guns? Can you imagine the fear of people realizing that the criminals had this advantage, and knew they did? I wouldn't like it one bit. Even with tons of police present, these incidents still happen.

Gun crimes are simply almost NEVER committed by people who have concealed carry and own guns legally. We CANNOT just conveniently overlook this point. Banning guns for them would do nothing.

If you want to save expensis (Stockholm is expensive)try to reserve room at a youth hostel, cheap hotel now, that will cut your expenses considerably. Stockholm doesn't really have a ""super bad"" area where you can't stay, and, the places will be reasonably clean and provide you with a bed, perhaps share a shower and a toilet.

There are lots of places to go in Stockholm. If you search for Stockholm in r/sweden or r/stockholm, you will get loads of tips.

However, if you are here in June, I'd advice you to take the boat to the archipelargo, maybe stay over a night in Sandhamn (the staying over will be expensive, but you *will* party and have fun), or just borrow a tent from somewhere.

true,Guedado,,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"The mindset expressed in this article is exactly what defines the ""ugly german"". I'm really disgusted after reading this.


Germany has learned nearly nothing. They learned to be quiet and to avoid certain things but it's received as a punishement beeing forced on them from outside and they are waiting for the one day that they are finaly allowed to go ""back to normal"".


We don't need to be healed from a ""national psychosis"" and I'm not yearning for forgiveness. Having the own grandparents and the country you live in beeing involved in atrocities of this proportion is not a flaw that disappers if only I repent enough. It is something that helps me to understand why things like nationalism, racism and all the other fucked up stuff need to be overcome. I become unsettled if someone next to me waves a german flag (you know what? any flag...) - not because I'm ashamed of anything but because I reject the concept of nationalism.


The examples given in the article don't relate directly to ww2. They illustrate a red line of violence and ugly incidents throughout time.

* Günther Grass poem criticizing Israel is not a scandal beause ""Hitler"". It is beeing rejected because it's a dull sequence of phrases coming from an old ""intellectual"" poet who always tried to be the ""german conscience"" but forgot to admit that he himself was in the Waffen SS.

* German Rower Nadja Drygalla is involved with one of the leading nazis from her hometown. Terrorising the streets of [the city that produced this pictures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBQnc7MQLt0)

* The National Socialist Underground did not murder all this people without beeing noticed. There are plenty of connections to authorities and the secret service, that was founded by high ranking nazis after the war.


&gt;Does it happen elsewhere? Of course it does. Other countries, like Hungary, &gt;the Netherlands, France and Denmark, even have radical right-wing parties &gt;represented in their national parliaments. Does that mean it isn't really all &gt;that bad in Germany? No, it is. Even after almost 70 years, it does make a &gt;difference whether an act of xenophobia happens in Germany or in Spain. We &gt;remain a special case, because Hitler is one of us.

WTF? Anybody here can find a personal connection to this past and has to answer the question why radical right wing tendencies (or violence or whatever) are a bad thing. For me, growing up in germany it maybe starts with the question whether or not I can rely on the claim that ""grandpa was just a common soldier fighting for his country"" beeing true or not. Or if they really couldn't know anything about the holocaust (of course they knew!). If I would live in the netherlands for example I would feel the urge to find an answer to why the government back then closed the borders for jews trying to flee germany after the Kristallnacht 1939 or why more than 70% of the dutch jews were deported by the nazis while in france it were only 25%?

Don't waste time pointing fingers on others, nothing someone did (or didn't) makes anybody else beter or worse.

Young people in Spain are nowadays quite able to have a decent conversation in english (still far away from other european countries, bear that in mind), so that should ease up the transition a bit in case you are momentarily lost in translation. 

People will be friendly to you in general. I spent part of the summer of 2001 with a bunch of american students and they made a ton of friends and generally had a great time. However, be prepared to discuss and be asked about life in the US, in europe people are quite aware of what's going on in the US and they will ask you about republicans (deemed to be nuts), Obama, social medical care, gun control, obesity and a lot of topics which are regarded to be ""american"". I think people in Spain are naturally very curious toward americans because we are so familiar with the culture and the country, and yet the opportunity of actually talking and interacting with them rarely presents itself.

I would suggest sharing an apartment with people your age, this will be by far best option in terms of learning the language and making friends. Rents are not terribly cheap, I would expect to be paying around 200-250€ per month for an ok room, although I'm a bit out of touch with this so don't quote me here.

Oviedo is small city, depending of where you are from in the US, it'll strike you that you can walk absolutely anywhere. Almost everything is within walking distance and it is a city conceived to be walked. The main ""going out"" scene is clustered around the old part of the city, which is quite unique, a place called El Antiguo. You'll walk around those streets drunk more than once and twice. Going back home completely hammered passing by  medieval buildings has a certain charm...

I can't really comment on the classes since I didn't study there and I'm spanish, but I think it may be a bit tough on the beginning. Don't sweat it though, ask around for ""los apuntes"" (the notes) and try to study it at your pace. 

In general, you'll like it a lot, I hope. I was born there and go there quite often, and it is quite a unique city.

How much spanish do you know already? will you be taking the classes they have for foreigners? I think that the program here you get what you put into it.  I was only here 3 months and I noticed quite a difference in my spanish level.  This is also a great way to really experience spanish culture because its a small city.  Which is great because you can literally walk to whole thing in under an hour.  As for living with a family vs. Apartment, I would say that it depends on what type of person you are.  Host parents can be good depending on who you get.  I was lucky enough to have really great ones, and the food they made was fantastic.  But, you can find student flats for much cheaper, and you might be put with people who are doing the Erasmus program, which would also be cool.  The school also has a Program called Tandem which sets you up with a language partner, I suggest you do that because you can have up to three partners and you can make some spanish friends.  I think thats really the only con.  Its hard to meet younger spanish people due to the way the language program for foreigners is set up.  You are in classes with basically just Americans and Chinese.  Luckily for me we had an exchange student at my university last year from Oviedo and he took me out a lot.  As for the culture here, have you ever been to europe before? if not it will be a bit drastic at frist but basically everything except cafes and bars are open at night, everything shuts down around 2-4 for the lunch and siesta.

&gt; The reunification **- at that point in time** - was the worst thing that could have happened

This is complete hindsight. You apparently fail to realize that re-unification was not by *any* measure guaranteed. Most people didn't believe that it would happen in their lifetime, if at all. I'm not one to defend Kohl (I still think he schould have gone to 'Beugehaft' for not disclosing his donors), but to argue that re-unification was a *stunt* is wrong to the point where it becomes asinine. Sorry, but it really is.

Not taking the chance for unification at that moment in time while waiting for a better deal would likely have resulted in permanently independent german states - do you really think that after 40 years of DDR and then perhaps 40 more independent of the USSR *and* western germany, people in the east would still have the same one-half-of-the-same-whole connection to the west and vice versa? At least at that moment in time, there were many split families. 40 years later this would have been historical, and most people would have been born and raised without ever having met their fellow west germans.

The reality is: re-unification was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that no sane politican could have passed up. Kohl made his legacy with it, true, but that doesn't make the historical re-unification of a split people under influence of 4 other powers a *stunt*.

As an argument against gun control, it's heavily flawed. The [1996 Dunblane massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_school_massacre) - which is cited as the second worst K-12 school shooting - was the catalyst for the [Firearms (Amendment) Acts 1997](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_%28Amendment%29_Act_1997), which banned all handguns.

But it's still worth bearing in mind that Europe does suffer from public shootings. The gun control proposed here, by Piers Morgan and others, doesn't stop these tragedies from taking place.

While restricting access to firearms is [undoubtedly a step in the right direction](http://www.neontommy.com/sites/default/files/users/user717/gc5.png), it's important that we keep in mind that it isn't ""job done"" in Europe, and more steps still need to be taken towards preventing these massacres both here and in the United States.",0,1355792328,null,0,false,0,c7i8u0c,t3_14zmz7,t1_c7i8u0c,t1_c7hx0zz,null,1430702633,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hmm-Europe is a lot of different countries with different systems and economics, but I'll answer you from the perspective of a Swede, from Stockholm

Short answer:No

Long answer:No, not when it comes to emergency surgeries, surgeries because of a life threathening illness like cancer or something similar. 

Yes, sometimes you have to wait several months, for surgery. In some areas, the demand is just bigger than the number of surgeons. One such area I remember reading about is weight loss surgery, where I think they can wait for up to a year, unless there is something really emergency- like that pushes you forward.

My area Stockholm, has a policy though you should have the surgery within three months from the first contact with the doctor, (or they will purchase the service/operation from another area of Sweden). Does it work 100 %? Most certainly not, but 90- 95 %. 

Normally it works like this. You go to the doctor, you schedule you surgery, and you do it within a month or two. For example, my knee surgery the last time. I did have to wait for four months, but that was because I wanted *that* surgeon, so it was really my fault. I could have had it done within six weeks. It wasn't urgent, so I decided to wait. 

I am currently holding off a different surgery (which they said they could have done within a month, by the surgeon of my choice) since I don't really have time to spend two months on crutches, but I'll get around to it eventually. 

Oh, and for all my surgery, medicine,hospital stays etc , I know I will never have to pay more than 900 ($ 135) SEK for the care/year and 2000 ($300)SEK for the medicine (and you can work around that if you are poor), even if I spend the next six months in a hospital.

true,Cyreal,null,null,"The younger generation of French of Algerian / Morrocan / Tunisian descent are very segregated and live in tight communities. They do not see themselves as French or in any way pride their nationality because of past colonisations / wars for independance / racial segregation (as a French born from French descent this is my perspective). 

Their ancestors mostly came to France after the first and second world wars when France was in desperate need of manual labor. I have trouble understanding why the older generations are integrated and do not stir up trouble like the younger generation (which is what Extreme Right Wing supporters are tired of).

Radical Islamists in France are a serious issue. A few months ago 3 Jewish kids and 2 adults were shot right in front of their school by radical muslims. The jewish community is constantly being attacked, but the French catholics are also victim of assault, theft, etc... for no particular reason. Having lived in France I can say I never felt safe walking alone on the streets. I've been in several situations and fights where a group of 6 will pick out and harass random strangers, beat them, rob them, spit on them. Most of these individuals are under the age of 18 and cannot be trialed as adults so nothing really happens... Even if they are under the age of 18 they are pretty scary: they are armed, they will rally their buddies in the blink of an eye, they are not scared and very cocky...

To be honest this is one of the main issues why I moved to California. Coming from Marseille (the now sketchiest city in all of France), where gangs operate in the daytime, have no problem beating up people above the age of 80, women, minors... I voted for her father 6 years ago in the presidential elections!

Her ideas are very extreme and economically unfavorable for France, many southern french states (etats) voted for her because the situation is so out of hand.

On the other hand; obviously there is also a big population of non aggressive, integrated, french muslims but they are given a bad image.

For example:

- French are adverse to hiring muslims and darker colored individuals

- Nightclubs will NOT let them in PERIOD (I've worked in several clubs 
where this was the case around Cannes).

- People in general are sketched out if strangers talk to them.


Patriotic? Definitely!

Racist? Most likely!

Fear that prooved just too justified when the Easterners crashed our economy two years later with cheap labor and tons of broken infrastructure.

If asked back then, a lot of us would have opted not only to keep the Iron curtain, but to put a few more bricks on top of it. 

Kohl's election forcasts were quickly dwindling in the late 1980s, and it was almost certain he would have been the first chancellor to be kicked out of office by an election in 1990s. By doing the reunification - in a constitutionally at least questionable way no less - he managed to get the PDS into the Bundestag at the cost of the Social Democrats, and thus got re-elected.

If after a few decades of Bonn-controlled rebuild, the Easterners would hav decided to keep their country, then why not?

Erstmal bringt er die Waffen durcheinander. Das SIG 550 ist ein Sturmgewehr, keine Maschinenpistole. Das ist durchaus wichtig weil eine Maschinenpistole eben Pistolenmunition schießt, und nicht die Gewehrmunition, die die Schweizer ja seit 2007 nicht mehr mit nach Hause kriegen.

Der Vergleich mit Israel ist albern. Soldaten haben Gewehre, ja, was ne Überraschung. Privat dürfen Israelis auch keine Gewehre besitzen, wobei das Erreichen bestimmter Ränge für Lizenzen qualifizieren kann. Aber wer kein Regiment kommandiert hat, muss sich mit Pistolen begnügen.

In den nordischen Ländern mit der Jagdkultur ist es übrigens nicht anders als bei uns, dementsprechend besitzen die Deutschen auch entsprechend ähnlich viele Waffen wie Finnen oder Schweden: Jagdgewehre sind mit Jagdlizenz erlaubt und stellen den größten Teil privat lizenzierter Waffen. Anders als in den USA dürfen geladene Waffen nicht transportiert werden bzw. offen oder verborgen als Waffen getragen werden.

Letzlich sind diese Vergleiche aber auch deshalb albern, weil die Getzeslage noch nicht eine entsprechende Waffenkultur macht. Mit 88 Feuerwaffen auf 100 Haushalte sind diese in den USA eben mit Abstand weiter verbreitet als überall sonst. Israel: 7! 

Der Artikel ist nichts als ein deutsches Echo der amerikanischen Waffenlobby, die jetzt (wie jedes mal) wieder von Waffengesetzen ablenken will, indem sie die Schuld auf das Gesundheitssystem schiebt.

I remember seeing those huge construction programs in spanish cities 5 years ago and I was thinking back then: ""That is going to backfire"" and it did.

We need to establish a special economic zone in the south with low taxes in order to attract manufacturing and build middle class capital.

Just like China did with Guangdong or Shanghai.

I mean the biggest company in Greece prior 2010 was Coca Cola hellenic bottling.

I hate the CAP more than the next guy, but in the grand scheme of comparing the future trade btw the UK and the EU and the CAP, well, the CAP is nothing. That is what I mean with childish arguments.

true,minikrob,MPyrenees,Midi-Pyrénées,"Loin de moi l'idée de vouloir créer une polémique, mais je ne suis pas tout à fait d'accord.  
Cela dit, ça fait du bien de voir une argumentation 'construite' (et un peu hargneuse...) allant dans ce sens.

Il ne s'agit après que de convictions politiques personnelles, mais je pense qu'il y a, comme pour tout, une limite à ne pas franchir pour rester dans le domaine du raisonnable; y compris lorsqu'il s'agit de contribuer, à la hauteur de ses revenus, au bien être social et à la réussite financière de ses compatriotes moins chanceux, ou parfois mois travailleurs.

Il n'y a pas besoin de se creuser beaucoup la tête pour calculer que les 82% de 2 millions de salaire plus biens matériels dépassent certainement les 2 millions de contributions annuelles dans le cas de M. Depardieu (sur un base très approximative de plus de 500k€ de biens imposables: immeubles, bateaux, résidences,...).  
Sur la même base, certains diront probablement que les 400k€+ restant suffisent amplement à combler la vie d'un homme et sa famille pour un an, et ces personnes ont probablement raison.  
De plus, si chaque personne a des motivations ou des buts différents, l'une des natures fondamentales de l'Homme est de pourvoir au besoin de sa famille au plus haut degré, et il est naturel de vouloir bâtir un patrimoine pour les siens (matériel et économique, à l'heure actuelle il coûte de 35% à 45% du prix du bien d'en hériter si celui-ci a une valeur supérieure à 900k€, si vous voulez transmettre une maison à vos enfants, prévoyez de leurs remplir les poches avant...).

Après les références mathématique, philosophique et juridique, c'est ici que la touche personnelle politique viendra biaiser à tous notre avis, et nous faire diverger de l'objectivité des faits présentés précédemment : il coûte très cher de pourvoir aux besoins des génération future, et les 400k€ annuels restant à M. Depardieu après imposition seront certainement absorbés en frais de succession, après quoi il ne restera pas grand chose. Peut être gagne t'il beaucoup plus, je n'en sais rien, mais 82% resteront 82%.

Il me parait important qu'il y ait une limite, un plafond, à appliquer pour qu'il reste quand même quelque chose aux riches, après tout ce n'est pas non plus le but de les rendre pauvres. Admirons leur réussite, leur chance parfois, envions leur biens, certes !  
Mais respectons les dans leur droit de pouvoir eux aussi construire quelque chose pour les leurs et de pouvoir profiter de leur réussite.  
Et attention, si j'adopte cette posture empathique, c'est bien parce que l'on parle de notre Gérard Depardieu nationnal. S'il est bon vivant et a su le prouver à maintes reprises, je ne pense pas que cet homme terre à terre, à l'esprit très provincial, fasse partie des bandes de JetSetters flambant l'intégralité de leur fortune en futilités à longueur de journée. 

N'est il pas donc sensé de plafonner les taxes sur ce genre de fortunes à X millions ou Y%, afin de laisser quelque chose aux gens qui l'ont généralement mérité ? Considérant qu'ils font partie des 10% plus riches, n'est-ce pas logique de considérer d'arrêter les taxes sur une personne lorsqu'elles sont assez élevées pour améliorer la vie de 10 de ses frères ?

That is not correct. Every political force that styles itself ""patriotic"" is adamant about the idea that only ""true"" member of their tribe are worthy of having any political rights. Hell, try to state that you don't really care about &lt;insert_country&gt; and get elected to any office. Being a patriot is a hidden assumption and a hidden requirement. Being a patriot also make you extremenly short sighted and limited only to member of your tribe.

In essence, I think that this layer of ""nation"" in a hierarchy between ""my circles"" --&gt; ""my nation"" --&gt; ""humanity"" consisnt of one element not needed. If you're going to care about a broad community, be it everyone one the planet, and not only &lt;insert_nationality&gt;.

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; I actually share at least some of the concerns that Britain has with the EU, but simply Britain has made it absolutely impossible to side with them in an argument, because instead of creating alliances and changing the EU from the inside Britain fights tooth and nail of opt-outs, exemptions or threatens vetoes.

The problem is one of basic maths....

For anything to carry in the EU it needs 2 of Germany, France and the UK to agree. The backing of Italy and/or Spain pretty much guarantees it after that. The other countries may be able ot take the edge off policies but you're not going to upset France, Germany and the UK and get a policy through. This all seems reasonable since those countries have the largest populations and economies. 

However, from the UK perspective, Germany has been keen to do what France says since it's making up for WW1 &amp; 2 and on the occasions when the UK and Germany have agreed on this France is able to hobble it if it is in their interest since they can often rally Italy and Spain to their side.

So, the UK knows that in many cases France will have Italy and Spain on side and therefore a bigger point of leverage with Germany. The UK's natural partners, Poland, Netherlands, Denmark and a few other countries are small and don't have the same level of influence. 

Now, this is a simplification but the general pattern is applicable if you look back over the last 40 years. The only real major change is that in the last 10 years Germany has been less accomodating of France.

I strongly think that multiculturalism and communitarianism prevent ~~muslims~~ blacks, arabs and berbers to succeed in France. Hence criticizing France's secularism is not a way to be pro-Muslim.

&gt;Do you understand anything about Jewish politics?

Have you read [this book](http://www.amazon.fr/Isra%C3%ABl-juifs-lantis%C3%A9mitisme-Jacques-Attali/dp/2708237721/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355834761&amp;sr=1-1) by Jacques Attali, Pascal Boniface and Gérard Israël ? (Attali and Israël are jews, and I love them, but they heavily criticize Israël's policy AND PROPAGANDA).

Here's an advice from [Jacques Attali](http://www.courrierinternational.com/article/2009/10/26/jacques-attali-l-antisemitisme-et-la-propagande-israelienne):

&gt;Israël a une vision stratégique très pauvre de la judéité. Cette problématique n'est pas seulement israélienne, mais propre à notre monde globalisé. La France peut s'appuyer sur ses 3 millions de Français qui vivent à l'étranger, la Chine peut compter sur ses 100 millions de nationaux expatriés. Tant que, pour vous, on ne pourra être juif que selon la Halakha [la loi judaïque], la tendance dominante au mariage mixte et au melting-pot finira par détruire le peuple juif. Israël et le judaïsme traditionnel vont devoir se poser la question de la conversion. Il va falloir adopter une conception active de la conversion. Quiconque a un parent juif, a été élevé dans une famille juive ou veut vivre en tant que juif doit pouvoir être accepté et reconnu comme juif, sinon la communauté juive disparaîtra.

Basically, religions need to adapt to be more open to external criticism. This includes being able to laugh when Charlie Hebdo does its job, instead of saying it promotes racism.

Turns out that Sweden is cited as a country where GINI presents many misleading data.

Also, the GINI index for total income inequality over the world is estimated at 0.61-0.68. Apparently income inequality in the world is better than the one in Sweden. Well, isn't that some useful info. I'm sure everyone in Sweden is outraged.

At the end of the nineties, a new legislation was introduced to favour the construction industry, making real-state speculation really easy and lucrative for some (specially banks and big construction companies). These laws led to the abandonment of other traditional industries (which would have been more resilient against the crisis), and a lack of investment on new technologies and research.

For over a decade people were overpaying quite a lot for their homes, in the benefit of banks and speculators, but it was manageable for most because the unemployment was low. Additionally, tax evading became an even more of a common practice for big fortunes. As a side note, during all those years most of the public workers had their salaries frozen.

Then the crisis struck, rendering people unable to pay for houses, which in turn destroyed all the industry depending on construction (that is, most of it), and unemployment skyrocketed.

ROMANCE DE ABENÁMAR

—¡Abenámar, Abenámar,   moro de la morería,
el día que tú naciste   grandes señales había!
Estaba la mar en calma,   la luna estaba crecida,
moro que en tal signo nace   no debe decir mentira.

Allí respondiera el moro,   bien oiréis lo que diría:
—Yo te lo diré, señor,   aunque me cueste la vida,
porque soy hijo de un moro   y una cristiana cautiva;
siendo yo niño y muchacho   mi madre me lo decía
que mentira no dijese,   que era grande villanía:
por tanto, pregunta, rey,   que la verdad te diría.
—Yo te agradezco, Abenámar,   aquesa tu cortesía.
¿Qué castillos son aquéllos?   ¡Altos son y relucían!

—El Alhambra era, señor,   y la otra la mezquita,
los otros los Alixares,   labrados a maravilla.
El moro que los labraba   cien doblas ganaba al día,
y el día que no los labra,   otras tantas se perdía.
El otro es Generalife,   huerta que par no tenía;
el otro Torres Bermejas,   castillo de gran valía.
Allí habló el rey don Juan,   bien oiréis lo que decía:
—Si tú quisieses, Granada,   contigo me casaría;
daréte en arras y dote   a Córdoba y a Sevilla.
—Casada soy, rey don Juan,   casada soy, que no viuda;
el moro que a mí me tiene   muy grande bien me quería.

Da quanto leggo il professore sembra uno di quelli che ti fa amare la scuola piuttosto che odiarla, e onestamente mi dispiace che finirà per perdere il posto. Ci sono ben pochi insegnanti che rientrano in questa categoria, e si vede.

Dall'altra parte invece non posso che notare come il test lo abbia fallito per demeriti propri piuttosto che, esempio, errori nella correzione. Non giustifico ne commento le modalità con cui è stata organizzata la prova perchè non ne ho letto il testo, però l'articolo sembra dire che quei 9 poveracci che invece il test lo hanno passato hanno avuto culo più che bravura - e questo non mi piace. 

Da ex studente è capitato anche a me di prendere parte a esami\compiti in classe scritti coi piedi, e di fallire: la verità è che non ho mai fallito esclusivamente a causa di un test scritto male. E' pure vero che la posta in gioco per tutti quegli insegnanti era - ed è - più alta di un semplice esame, però non si può neanche fare la vittimella.

Che lui abbia fallito il test a causa di quella specifica domanda non ci è dato sapere (anzi, spero e dubito che non sia quello il caso), però considerando che parecchi utenti in questo thread sono riusciti and indovinare dopo qualche minuto di ponderazione mi fà riflettere.

Capisco l'incazzatura, ma capisco pure il perchè di un test di logica; il sistema scolatisco (e tutto quello che gli ruota intorno) è marcio e non funziona, però concludo dicendo: **Dude, man the fuck up.**

Au contraire, c'est avec les luttes sociales de la fin du XIX^ème siècle que la condition des ouvriers s'est (un peu) améliorée, après que la révolution industrielle libérale ait détruit les corporations et guildes qui protégeaient les manoeuvriers sous l'Ancien Régime. La mécanisation n'avait amené que les journées de 16 heures, l'absence de sécurité dans les usines, et la création et l'exploitation de la classe ouvrière, peu formée (les corporations ayant disparues) et mal payée, travaillant dans des conditions lamentables dont de nombreux romans britanniques (Dickens) ou français (Zola) se sont fait l'écho.

Seule la révolution bolchévique et les destructions massives de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale ont convaincu les industriels de l'intérêt d'une classe moyenne aisée et consommatrice, aujourd'hui rendue caduque (et en voie de disparition) par la disparition de l'ogre communiste et la globalisation de l'économie. Y voir les bienfaits du libéralisme demande vraiment d'ériger la mauvaise foi en philosophie de vie.

&gt; Ce qui est bien c'est qu'un libéral ne t'empêchera pas de te regrouper en communauté ou en coopérative avec des gens qui pensent la même chose que toi.

Mais me laisseront-ils vivre en dehors d'un système marchand? L'Histoire nous enseigne que les sociétés communautaires n'ont jamais fait bon ménage avec les sociétés libérales. Les sociétés ayant une classe possédante et une classe ouvrière voient généralement d'un mauvais oeil les sociétés même soit-disant ""égalitaires"" (comme le furent les sociétés communistes, où la nomenklatura remplaça *de facto* l'ancienne aristocratie). Elles craignent la contagion culturelle qui feraient perdre ses avantages à la classe possédante, et les combattent dans une lutte à mort.

Je crains que tu n'aie une vision très utopiste et ahistorique des bienfaits du libéralisme. Comme de nombreuses utopies, le manque de raffinement conceptuel de la théorie libérale lui fait ignorer la complexité du monde pour tout ramener à un échange marchand et contractuel, lequel ignore les facteurs culturels, humains, écologiques, sociologiques et même spirituels dans une vision utilitariste stérile.

C'est assez triste, même si dans certains domaines de micro-économie son analyse peut être juste. Il faut toujours se méfier des systèmes totalisants, qu'ils soient de droite ou de gauche. L'économie n'est qu'un domaine restreint de l'expérience humaine, et ne devrait pas avoir l'emprise qu'elle exerce aujourd'hui sur nos vies depuis l'accession au pouvoir de la classe marchande.

Is it established in English that ""pride == looking down on others""? Maybe we just have problem with translation? In Polish we have 2 words for pride: ""pycha"" is the bad kind of pride, with looking down on others, ""duma"" is the kind where you know your value, but don't boast. It's actually seen as something desirable to have.

OK, entre l'apparition des machines à vapeur et la fin du XIXe les conditions sociales se sont détériorées... belle mauvaise foi

C'est un constat. Avec l'apparition du capitalisme le niveau de vie des hommes a augmenté d'une façon inédite. Augmentation de l'espérance de vie, développement de nouvelles technologies, amélioration des conditions de vie des plus pauvres...

...quant à l'influence d'une suppression du capitalisme son impact est mesurable (URSS, Cuba, Allemagne de l'Est)

Example 
You have 3 countries England, France, Germany (without Euopese Union)
Both france and England want to import to Germany
Germany has a tariff on goods entering the country of 10 Euro's, So both England and France have to compete with the Germans on terms advantageous for the Germans. 

Lets say that Germans can't fill the demands of their market completely, so there is demand for imported goods. 
If France produces the goods at 10 Euro (20 with tariff) and England at 5 Euro (15 with tariff)
Then the remaining demands of goods will be filled by English goods. 

Now, Bang, there is Europe.
This changes the inner market. Now we have France without a tariff that can ship their goods to Germany at 10 euro's cost, while it will cost the English 15 euro's. This gives the English a big disadvantage in trading with European countries. 

So because this disadvantage was too big the English wanted to enter the EU to negate this disadvantage. 
Not because of cultural reasons. 
Also the French tried to block English entry as long as they could.

Anyway, why would the English want out now, can't they see how big an advantage this inner market is?

That is because the WTO (world trade organization) which negotiates tariffs down between countries has an equality's principle. You can't say that one country gets a better tariff deal then another (Trade unions like the EU excluded), This would mean that every country got the best deals. 
Also the WTO has made much process in diminishing the tariffs, in the above example that might mean that instead of a 10 euro tariff, the tariff would only be 1 euro. Which would mean that the English (cost 6) would beat the french (cost 10)

Demande aux ouvriers d'Arcelor-Mittal.

&gt; OK, entre l'apparition des machines à vapeur et la fin du XIXe les conditions sociales se sont détériorées... belle mauvaise foi

Il va falloir développer un peu, là. Le constat que j'ai fait est historiquement inattaquable.

&gt; Ford, la voiture qui doit pouvoir être achetée par ses ouvriers, tout ça...

Ford était un excentrique chez les industriels, d'ailleurs largement vilipendé par ses pairs et la presse de son temps, et bien que sa vision ait fini par prévaloir (pour un temps), il va falloir pour cela attendre 1945, l'effort de guerre des USA (qui ne fut ni plus ni moins qu'une économie planifiée) et la fin de la crise économique de 1929 (sa conséquence). Ford n'est vraiment pas représentatif de son époque.

&gt; C'est un constat. Avec l'apparition du capitalisme le niveau de vie des hommes a augmenté d'une façon inédite. Augmentation de l'espérance de vie, développement de nouvelles technologies, amélioration des conditions de vie des plus pauvres...

*Post hoc ergo propter hoc*? Fais un petit effort, l'amélioration du niveau de vie des sociétés occidentales a eu de nombreuses causes, et il n'est pas du tout certains que le capitalisme y soit majoritairement pour quelque chose. Les avancées scientifiques et technologiques n'ont pas besoin de lui pour exister, l'industrialisation peut se faire sous d'autres régimes (telle l'industrialisation de la Russie communiste sous Staline), et l'amélioration des conditions de vie des plus pauvres sont comme je l'ai expliqué plus une conséquence des luttes sociales que du capitalisme.

&gt; En plus le capitalisme évite les éxécutions au passage...

Salvador Aliende aimerait te passer un message... Ainsi que l'Afrique, les anciennes colonies Européennes, les victimes de la Terreur, des deux Guerres Mondiales, etc.

Le capitalisme ne change pas la nature humaine. Encore une fois, tu te laisse aveugler par ton utopisme.

&gt; Exemple? 

La guerre froide, toute l'histoire des peuples primitifs lorsqu'ils ont rencontrés ceux d'Europe, etc.

FYI Madrid and Barcelona have huge pickpocketing issues. Be very careful with your passport, as it is a huge pain if you need to replace it. [Here is your government's advice to those travelling to Spain.](http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1024.html)

General travelling advice: 

* Always bring an entire day's worth of extra clothing so that if you run into trouble on your way home you don't have to worry about laundry for a whole day. 

* Make sure anything you can't stand to lose gets into your carry on, along with a spare change of clothes. 

* Check the current list of banned items every time you fly. The TSA changes it whenever they feel like it.

* Keep your jeans pockets empty on days you fly. If you don't have to wear a belt, leave it in your luggage.

L'égalité des chances c'est bien mignon mais ca se saurait si ca existait.
Moi je trouve ca dégueulasse de voir des gens vendre la maison de leurs parents pour payer les droits de succession. Et que dire des gens vivant dans des zones dites riches mais qui eux ne le sont pas, qui doivent déménager parce qu'on leur fait payer l'impot sur la fortune?

Les impots servent a faire tourner un pays, mais soyons lucides, nous payons de plus en plus d'impots, et le pays sombre toujours plus.

All those reforms were anything but leftist or even social democratic, even though they were introduced by the social democratic party. There's a reason they calle Schröder the ""Genosse der Bosse"" (comprade of corporate, loosely translated).

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"As a Frenchman, and knowing our stereotype, affairs are a big deal. I'd say just as much as in the US or any other western country. Perhaps there are more affairs than in the US, I don't know, but they're still a big deal.

Otherwise yeah, I think it's safe to say parents tend to not be very strict. I was allowed to watch everything I wanted on TV since basically birth. As a pre-teen, I'd watch X-files with my dad and other scary shows (it still scared me, but there was no issue about me being too young, it was TV nights and that's what we all wanted to watch). I got to watch R rated movies, like the Terminator at 7 or so, and things with sex scenes and nudity, and it would just be the typical thing where my Dad jokingly does a ""whooo"" and I immaturely laugh at how disgusting it is or something.

At 16 my parents let me move in with my 17 year old brother in a little apartment they owned but weren't using.

Also, in France at least (and other countries, but I know some are stricter in that regard) we can say a bad word on TV any time of the day and it won't be a national scandal.

So I'd say most of Europe is more open than the US in general, but some areas in the US which aren't conservative are just as open in everyday life (they just still can't hear ""fuck"" on TV before 10pm or something..)",0,1355856186,null,0,false,0,c7im4he,t3_1526lg,t1_c7im4he,t3_1526lg,null,1430709082,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

true,[deleted],null,null,"Definitely not. I think the main difference is the gap between the surface and the actual reality of people's actions, and beyond that, the differences are more or less minor (even tough they are probably there).

If you take a look at the (superficial) morals and moral statements of people, the difference between the US and Europe seem large. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that the behaviour of people is any more ""moral"" or ""amoral"" (taking the word ""morals"" with a grain of salt here). People might go to church every sunday and rant about sexual promiscuity, yet have regular extramarital affairs and children with abortions (Palin...). As an example, just look at those famous statistics that say that gay porn is most prominent in states of the bible belt. Maybe that gap is not as large in Europe.

Also, there are still massive regional differences between the different countries of Europe and the regions of specific countries. Poland is probably still significantly more religiously oriented than Norway; the rural parts of southern Germany are far more conservative than the metropolitan areas of NRW - as everywhere.

Well, having said that and having been to the US quite a lot of times, I would still (subjectively) say that the US is a little bit more uptight than most of Europe (at least the western and central parts, can't speak for the rest). And (sadly, mostly religiously induced) intolerance appears to be far more prevalent on the other side of the Atlantic. But it is definitely not as vast a difference as films and other things make it out to be.

A personal P.S.: I have middle-class, catholic, conservative parents. I tell them about my drug uses, my partying habits and to some degree they now about my sexual promiscuity and they don't really give me shit about it. They let me study something that almost guarantees a job as a taxi-driver. Or at least they don't say it outright. But I don't feel like I can speak for anybody else here.

Last week, the parliament issued a law explicitly allowing the circumcision of little boys, because religious groups (Jews, Muslims and Christians) used their power to pressure the gouvernment into it. Jewish matters cannot be questioned in Germany, because of our history. 

Granted, religious extremism here is not as widespread and politically powerful as in the US. But this is a matter of basic freedoms, values and moral discussion. People are extremely sensitive about their beliefs, so it is reasonable to be extremely sensitive when one discusses these things. A change has to be reached in union, because if you act on a similarly fundamentalist level, it becomes a religious war, even if you are not religious. The last thing you want is corner them, because they will just move closer together.

On a serious note, it depends. Europe is not a unicultural entity. Usually, people from the US blame Europeans for not understanding how diverse their country is. Europe is much more diverse. In many European countries, religion and upbringing are intertwined, thus making them much more conservative than what your typical art house film might present them to be (although not up to Tea Party standards).

&gt; Salve, sono un docente precario di lingua e civiltà inglese (classe di concorso A346) per le scuole secondarie di secondo grado (in altre più umane parole: le superiori), e ieri ho superato la prova pre-selettiva del concorsone scuola. Tempo di studio e preparazione dedicato all’evento: venti minuti a metà di ottobre, il tempo di dare un occhio a una delle simulazioni della prova stessa.

&gt; Quello che volevo dire è che uno si può lamentare di qualsiasi cosa, QUALSIASI COSA per quanto riguarda questo concorso: che è inutile e dannoso, che andrà a creare ulteriore precariato, che danneggia non solo una categoria professionale già ai minimi storici, ma peggiora ulteriormente le condizioni di lavoro del comparto, che duplica certificati e abilitazioni già ottenute con dispendi di tempo e denaro pubblici e privati etc etc e invece di cosa frignano tutti? Di quanto erano difficili e non collegate all’insegnamento una dozzina e mezza di domande di logica (perché tutte le altre domande (lingua, informatica, comprensione testo) erano idiozie belle e buone, roba neppure da Settimana Enigmistica - e il trucco era in fondo tutto qua: una volta risposto alle 32 domande non di logica-matematica in tutta scioltezza (io ci ho messo 18 minuti, ma suppongo che a impegnarcisi ne bastavano al massimo 12), era sufficiente azzeccare tre risposte della sezione logico-matematica per passare (e pure moltissime di queste erano di una semplicità spaventosa, con operazioni che non andavano oltre la semplice addizione); anche il più testone ci sarebbe dovuto arrivare). Ai tempi del concorso SSIS avevo fatto un esame pre-selettivo che era molto più fuori di melone (la grande domanda, una fra molte, “In che anno sono state fondate le Guardie Svizzere?” la racconto con grande successo ogni volta che posso). Se quella volta avevo studiato due giorni e mezzo, questa volta, ripeto, ho guardato per venti minuti una delle simulazioni a metà ottobre, e basta.

How about you [learn something](http://www.understandfrance.org/France/Intercultural7.html) :

&gt;Anti-communautarism : France sees as morally unacceptable the maintenance of separate communities (Jewish, Arab, Polish, Greek). This policy, called "" communautarism "", is very unpopular and largely rejected. In France, no group can declare religious freedom or respect of religious traditions as means for maintaining a lifestyle, schooling or social customs that would be visibly different than that of the majority. Therefore, many groups, such as the Amish, which are perfectly natural in the U.S., would be considered a separatist group in France. For Americans, who believe each group should maintain and even accentuate its differences, the French attitude represents a lack of democracy. The French believe, on the contrary, that forming a common nation and a common culture comes from a desire to be different from one's origins and to strive for the higher goal of ""melting "" into one nation with the same schools, the same language, and that all people are French (in France minorities do not describe themselves as African-French, Chinese-French, etc.). This is why the proportion of immigrants who get French nationality is among the highest in the world (read more about naturalization). This is also why it is forbidden by law to collect any data relative to race, religion, sexual orientation, etc... For example in a French cemetery, you rarely find a Jewish or Muslim quarter : we're all equal (especially when dead...). Along with the French vision of religious freedom, this is the reason for the law on the Islamic veil : no ostensible signs of religious differences in the public schools. See a few examples of unacceptable provocations, in the name of religious freedom. Another example : in June 2008 a court in Northern France voided a marriage on the grounds that the bride had hidden to her would-be husband that she was not a virgin. The (Muslim) husband pleaded that, the marriage being a contract, the law on contracts should be applied : if a contractor hides ""a substantial part "" about the nature of the contract, it is void and has never existed. It was not a divorce but an nullification. The entire country was horrified (73% ""very shocked"") and the Minister of Justice Rachida Dati appealed the decision. For a large majority of the French, a minority of obtuse religious fanatics must not set its own rules under the protection of the law, which must be the same for all. And, in the name of ""laicité"" (secularism), religious beliefs (or superstitions) must not found a court decision. This vision is very different from American and British visions ; see comparative figures : French Muslims feel more French (42%) than British Muslims feel British (7% only) and a comparative European study.",0,1355858473,null,0,false,0,c7imuic,t3_14w56k,t1_c7imuic,t1_c7ilr39,null,1430709412,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

The second one: Indeed, it's a bit strange. The holocaust still is a weak spot. We're all very sorry and don't like people lying about such tragedies. However, denying certain people had knowledge/were complicit of the holocaust is acceptable if backed by evidence.

We do feature some kinds of censorship: Mein Kampf isn't censored in Belgium, but if I'm not mistaken, all reprints and selling of the book is prevented through copyright law. The Belgian state actually has the copyright on Mein Kampf.

Great for seeing the chokepoints in the connection, and where any delays in place might happen. It's just more detailed and interesting data.

You should however compare your home connection instead of your workplace, since the two can possibly vary greatly in performance. For the record, my ratings were from my home, passing through a router(though top of the line, so It probably doesn't add any real meaningful delay).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute here's the wikipedia explanation of traceroute anyways.


EDIT: also when you got the time, I'd love to actually see the traceroute plainly from your home PC without any additions nor removals to the connecting signal(IE: Keep the router if you can). The possible delay from your router would be seen on the tracert as well, so there's no problem distinguishing the data there.

&gt;Following the Crimean War, with Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, Kogălniceanu was responsible for drafting legislation to abolish Roma slavery. Together with Alecsandri, he edited the unionist magazine Steaua Dunării, played a prominent part during the elections for the ad-hoc Divan, and successfully promoted Cuza, his lifelong friend, to the throne *[of both Wallachia and Moldavia, thus uniting them into the new country of Romania]*. Kogălniceanu advanced legislation to revoke traditional ranks and titles, and to secularize the property of monasteries. His efforts at land reform resulted in a censure vote, leading Cuza to enforce them through a coup d'état in May 1864. However, Kogălniceanu resigned in 1865, following his own conflicts with the monarch. A decade after, he helped create the National Liberal Party, before playing an important part in Romania's decision to enter the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878—a choice which consecrated her independence. He was also instrumental in the acquisition, and later colonization, of Northern Dobruja region. During his final years, he was a prominent member and one-time President of the Romanian Academy, and briefly served as Romanian representative to France.

You miss the point of a federation. That's ok, because most people in the EU do as well. Most people would prefer that the EU be all about the good times (expanding markets, etc...) and not about the bad time (sharing risk and wealth redistribution). Northern European countries would prefer the fantasy land of having the Southern European countries as a place to lend into *with no risk* and then sell into (mercantilism) rather than face up to the fact that natural guard against making stupid loans is not being repaid (or having to financially support the payor so that you can keep your loans on the books). 

Wealth redistribution between regions is an ingrained reality within a properly functioning federation (Canada is an example). It helps build regions that need to catch up rather than making those regions effective slaves of the richer regions. That is the price that the richer regions pay for a larger internal market within which to sell.

Anything else is just a scheme to fleece to poor and relatively powerless and leave them worse off than they would be not participating in the scheme.

If one is to believe various statements that have been made by representatives of the troika and Berlin, that would imply wage reductions across the board, among other things. It is hard to see how lowering the already the minimal wages paid in Portugal will improve its productivity, given that quite a bit of the Portuguese population has trouble making ends meet on their wages.

The prosperity that preceded austerity in Portugal and led it into crisis (along with other factors) was a bubble created by foreign banks looking to lend surplus money to people who had no business borrowing those sums. An anecdotal example that can be confirmed by driving down the highway and asking questions at a few parties: German banks lending money to Portuguese people grossing 1000€ a month so they can drive around in a German-made sedan that cost them 40000€ or more; you know very well that this game was being played all over the place. I've never seen more BMWs, Mercedes and Audis driving around on a nation's roads outside of Germany than in Portugal.

And it's not just about sex... most of Americans are culturally 100 years back behind Europeans, although economically they're on the same level.

Adultery is socially tolerated here, although of course it destroys marriages and relationships. For example, our prime minister had a few lovers, then divorced his wife and nobody gave a fuck.  In the US a love affair can destroy one's career, as in the case of general Petraeus, which is kinda shocking to me. Further, there is no tolerance of porn and particularly child porn in the US, people have been arrested for hentai cartoons of children, and possession of child porn can be punished by up to life in prison.

Also their sex offender laws are appalling, where teenagers who had sex or people who urinated in public can be put on the list. 

And in general there the respect for the law is much bigger in the USA than in Europe - I dare say this is as if from some totalitarian utopian novel, except it's real. People turn in their parents and friends for crimes - indeed I read a thread on reddit some time ago when I was lurking and I almost fainted. A son found child porn in his father's PC and people advised him to turn his father in to the police. Terrifying. And then there is shit like security scanners in schools, gangs, school massacres, prison-industrial complex...

For a vague claim such as this I think uat2d response is appropriate enough. The government has no agenda to end the middle class, their just doing what they can to make sure we can keep honouring our debts. It's true that the choices they've made are not the best by a longshot and that the measures they've taken are unfortunately hurting everyone, but what other options do we have to fix our problems that do not lead to a reduction in the consuming power of Portuguese families? I see none, the choice to ""eliminate the middle class"" was not made by the government but by those before it who set us up in this unfortunate position.

&gt;As for the matter in question, it's quite obvious the government is burning out every option available that can allow the cronyism to endure.

Yes, it would be nice to see them heavily slash spending on PPPs, foundations and other cesspools of cronyism instead of raising taxes, liberals like me are pretty pissed at PSD for not daring to actually change things.

Naja, du hättest zumindest mal kurz, wie gebeten, sagen können was du zu dem Zitat von dem Vater hälst (""Auf der anderen Seite sitzt ein junges Mädchen, das mit ihren Möglichkeiten eben gar nicht überblicken kann, was da alles passiert und wird da mitgerissen und ausgebeutet""), selbst wenn du nur kurz bestätigst, dass *die Eltern sind schuld* das einzige ist was dir dazu einfällt.

Oder wie du es findest, das Ubisoft verspricht die Zahlungsmöglichkeiten zu überarbeiten bzw. behauptet das schon getan zu haben, sich dies aber allem Anschein nach als Lüge herausstellt.

Und das Video ist wirklich schlecht - ich unterstelle dir jetzt mal wohlwollend, dass du es nur gut findest, weil es ""grundsätzlich der gleichen Meinung"" wie du ist.

Zum Beispiel Frau Pfeiffer: das ""Argument"" gegen sie lautet im wesentlichen dass sie *alt ist, Blümchentapete besitzt und sich doch viel besser als Pornostar machen würde.* Kommentar zum BIU: *die haben ihre Stellungnahme verweigert, und das sieht jetzt schlecht aus.* Häh? Was will er denn damit sagen? LoL: *Dreiste Lüge! Da kann mein sein Geld gar nicht verlieren!! Während gesperrt ist kann man seine Einkäufe natürlich nicht nutzen, klar, und wenn man für immer gesperrt wird, ist das Geld futsch, aber das ist dann auch OK so.* Ehrlich, der Kerl bringt nicht ein einziges, auch nur halbwegs schlüssiges Argument bzw. kaum etwas was sich überhaupt als Argument bezeichnen lassen könnte; schießt sich dafür um öfter ins eigene Knie.

Ich glaube du verdrehst hier die Tatsachen ein wenig. Klar gibt es Meinungen die objektiv falsch oder richtig sind, und man muss sich über viele Dinge erst informieren und sich mit ihnen auseinander setzen um sich ein Urteil bilden zu können. In der Realität ist es aber eher eine Schwarz-Weiß-Sicht, die es einem erlaubt faul und ignorant zu sein. Denn wenn ich von meiner Position überzeugt bin, ist die Meinung meines Gegenüber per Definition wertfrei, und wer zum gleichen Schluss wie ich kommt, z.B. der Fabian aus dem Video, der muss ja gute und stichhaltige Argumente haben.

Aber das war gar nicht direkt der Punkt den ich meinte. Du solltest die Sachen einfach mal ein bisschen differenzierter sehen, denn du hast schließlich Frontal 21 eine Kampagne gegen die ""böse Videospielindustrie"" angedichtet, und das Video von oben war keine einfache Entgegnung auf den Beitrag, nein, es war eine Argumentation ""Pro-Computerspiel"". Man kann durchaus Computerspiele mögen und trotzdem nicht alles an ihnen und um sie toll finden.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You're a retard. Why?  


1) For continuing to call eastern European ""ex-USSR"". Although true, it's demeaning.


2) For failing to understand that the EU has benefited IMMENSELY for taking in Eastern Europe. In order for the economy to grow, you (the rest of the EU, especially Germany but Denmark too) need more and more customers, and new markets. The eastern part of Europe was basically a really close, very accessible, untapped vast market for all your products. Your own GDP and salaries went up specifically because of the eastern European markets.


3) In order for the countries to contribute, they need to be allowed at least 10-15 years to get up to speed. Look at Poland and Slovenia, they joined in 2004 and are really close to being net contributors, and have advanced immensely. Romania and Bulgaria joined in 2007, that means we should expect them to be to the level of Poland 3 years later, but because of the financial crisis, we might see a delay up to 2020 maybe until they become competitive enough to stop being a burden for the EU. Also, the funds for the EU are limited for a certain amount of time.

4) The EU constantly needs new labour and you know, eastern Europe is not as stupid as you might believe. Those countries are poorer because of bad politics and, as you did not fail to mention, because of being held back from developing by the USSR. They aren't poorer because people are more stupid or inferior. In that same regard, the EU as a whole can benefit immensely from the labour (not only unskilled - I'm talking here for example programmers from Romania - we know they like to hack things, but they are also really good programmers - and the Poles are in the same situation too - they aren't just good at plumbing). Let me ask you this: Would you rather import labour in Denmark from India and Pakistan instead of Romania, Ukraine and Poland or Bulgaria - which are not only 95% culturally identical to you, but also have the same habits, religion, morals and values and integrate - and I need to emphasize integrate - into the society at large in a fairly short amount of time.",0,1355874582,null,0,1355874980,0,c7irpc1,t3_14zypr,t1_c7irpc1,t1_c7i6edh,null,1430711756,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Still defaulting on our debts does not change the path we must walk, we will get poorer and there's no avoiding that. We can't afford to consume so much with what we make so we either get wealthier, cut our consumption or both. We'll have to fall before we can rise again, there's no avoiding this.

Please, explain the scandal of the *Deutsche Bank* and the Euribor. Do theses things only happen in London. Please, explain, why the *EU* tried to *bribe* Swedish citizens in the Swedish match scandal. Is that the good side of the the EU we are seeing. Pleae, I'd like for you to explain that tom me (and I am guessing you will not, since you do not care about bribery and hypcracy. If you did, you would attack France). Frankly, my friend, you seem horribly naive. If you hate corruption - please explain southern Europe to me. Please explain why we are not following the rules of the Euro. You do know the rules, don't you? Who messed up? We (you do know that there is only three countries who has followed it the whole time- please, name them. And, according to your logic- hate all the others. )

Who, is most corrupt. Southern Europe, or northern. If you have the courage (which I doubt, you will never answer this since you are a coward),please, give me the statistic, why northern Europe is corrupt. 

The fact is you can't. You are, truly, talking out of you ass. Give me scienece or fuck off.

The rules- 60% debt/GDP. A balanced budget. A small budget deficicit. Are we talking about Portugal or Finland.

Who in the hell has broken the rules. 

It is not the UK. It is not Sweden

We didn't- you have- and you are trying to blame it on us, and you are somehow trying to blame it on *Skydiving*. Why - give me a reason, why Reinfeldt's economy is worse than Hollande. I'd like scientific facts, please

Look at the numbers. Compare any bloody number you want between Sweden and Germany, UK and France etc,

The fact is, which you do not want to admit, is that Sweden or the UK never fucked up - we still do not. If you want to blame the Euro problems on *Skydiving* instead of the finances of southern Europe, it says more about you than anyone.

Ok, that's your choice.  If you're scared they'll take it from you or scared to spare the time and minutes it doesn't matter, it's your phone do whatever you want with it.

There's really no other way to address the issue from the government's perspective than banning guns.

&gt;For example, most developed nations (excluding the US) have significant gun regulation, but none actually ban the ownership of all guns outright.

No, they just create a mess of regulations that effectively ban guns for normal, law-abiding citizens while maintaining their availability for psychopaths.
