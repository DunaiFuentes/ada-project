Second, bailing out the financial sector. Tax cuts, lower wages and financialization of the economy (with state backing for the inevitable crashes) is neoliberalism, plain and simple. 

Reading up on the history of the IMF in the Global South provides some useful context here. All across Africa and Latin America, governments received loans from banks in Europe and the US that they had no hope of paying back. They were then forced into Structural Adjustment Programs (austerity). As a result of the ensuing mass privatizations, enormous amounts of assets are sold off at fire-sale prices. Wages and welfare are gutted, and the country remains in permanent debt servitude. All the while, the irresponsible and predatory lenders in the North sit back and collect fat interest payments.

Since 1980, governments of the global south have sent over $4.6 trillion to their creditors in the US and Europe. Their debts will never be paid off, and their populations are mired in permanent austerity. 

Look around Europe and see if this looks familiar.

I never blamed Germany or any other non-Greek government for the Greek debt crisis (though they didn't screen Greece good enough when they started lending money to them and allowed them in the Eurozone, so they're not fully innocent).

&gt;Diddums. Have you heard about what is going on in Africa?

So it doesn't matter that Greece or Spain explode into mass riots and poverty, because there are also African countries who experience the same? I really don't get your point here I think.

&gt;Almost. Yes the Weimar Republic has an influence but I'm sure decades of watching Club Med play beggar thy neighbour with currency devaluations also had some sway in thier thinking. Low inflation is generally considered to be a positive thing.

A lot of other countries did devaluations too. Like Belgium. That's not necessarily beggar thy neighbour policy. Low inflation is indeed a positive thing in general, but in bad times it can be very stifling.

&gt;One thing you've miss regarding Keynes is that he suggests saving during good times. It is clearly demonstratable that didn't happen, so I'm not sure how further spending would help now.

I don't. Surplus saving can also come afterwards. After we've saved the economy instead of destroying it. This surplus saving should also be a condition for receiving the money.

&gt;This comes as a surprise to many, but there are people who do not believe Keynes has a point. His theory is based on very few data points, and a lot of his teorems have been prooven to be fallacious. Without knowing it, most Germans are supporters of Hayek.

The same goes for Hayek. Nothing is proven in Economic Sciences. Economic sciences couldn't predict the crisis and today it's in crisis itself. Every popular model (New Business Cycle, New Keynesian and New Political Economics) failed. Decisions made today are hardly backed up with hard data. It's mostly based on political ideology and economic intuition.

This is also a discussion between Walrasian and Marshallian economics. Today Walras is the most popular apparently, but I don't get why Marshall would have been less right.

&gt;Those people are free to create small communes, based on self-sufficiencs, supporting each other. Just because there is no money does not mean there is no demand, for home-grown vegetables, for information, for transportation, or for services.

Such systems are already emerging in Greece, and we experiment about it in Germany, too.

Yes and everyone who want to join the community should sign a contract where they declare they'll only act out of pure egoism. Then we will have created the perfect utopia according to Ayn Rand and everything will be amazing.

I don't think WWIII is starting which seems to be what you are implying.

I think one has to take responsibilty for ones choices, both as a person, and as a country. I don't think a lot of countries (and persons) are doing that though.I think in the long run it benefits everybody. 


We (Sweden) had a financial crises in the 90's and I can really say that it was good that we had it, good that we had to fix it ourselves as well. That crises paved the way for a common fear among people and politicians alike for inflation/to much debt/ borrowing/overspending and has led to the fact that nowdays *none* of the big parties dare not to balance a budget. We have a more independent national bank than ECB and we've been paying off debts like there's no tomorrow, which in the long run has helped us.

It honestly doesn't strike me as many countries of the EZ have that sense of responsibility of the crises yet, it is, after all, they who have created it (just like Sweden created our own crise). I mean, heck, we are talking about retiring at 70 now, and people in other countries are demonstrating because they are at 65? Seriously, for the pensions to work, one *has* to work longer. That is just one example of how I think the Swedish mindset was positively changed by the crises, and I really don't see why that can't happen in other countries. It will not happen though, as long as one keeps on throwing good money after bad, nor will it happen if one alway blame other people. 

Besides, you haven't answered how loyal/solidaric it is to live on other peoples money. Why should just we be loyal with our wallets, why not them? I'd rather be loyal in that sense that I know it's going to hurt me to if they fall, but seriously, they might need it to fix themselves.

Other countries, some of them in Southern Europe benefited as well. I am not saying everything is/was bad, but while we paid off debt, reformed labour market (we still need to do a lot more btw), balanced budgets etc, other countries *choose* not to. So, now we have to pay even more since they have behaved (financially) bad.That is unfair and disloyal of those countries refusing to change.

Honestly, when talking about being ""loyal"" to other countries, I don't think they are being very loyal towards the EU or the Eurozone. It's not loyal to *always* receive money. It's not loyal to live on other people's money, it's not loyal to refuse to reform. Perhaps they need this to wake up.

Personally, I think Greece should exit the EZ.

&gt;But it's also important to keep the EU alive.

The EU is alive, maybe the EZ is not. If the EZ  can't handle the pressure, then maybe it should fall. I am not big on keeping government, banks, states going forever with the help of aid. Sure, sometimes it can be beneficial with some extra help, but Southern Europe have received extra money since the EU was formed- maybe this is what the EU needs to see that you just can't transfer money endlessly. Sure it will hurt a lot, but it will be better in the long run. If you are not ready for it, stop entering fiscal unions. Can't stop being corrupt - well, then you are not getting any more money. We are putting band aids on what essentially needs surgery - that has to stop one way or another, and better sooner than later.

I know. Greece had a debt of 98% in 1993. But Belgium had a debt of 125% in 1993. That's what I wanted to say. We didn't end up in a situation like Greece because we have (had) a huge private surplus. Greece doesn't.

&gt;Honestly, when talking about being ""loyal"" to other countries, I don't think they are being very loyal towards the EU or the Eurozone. It's not loyal to always receive money. It's not loyal to live on other people's money, it's not loyal to refuse to reform. Perhaps they need this to wake up. 

Well, I think this only really applies to Greece and maybe Protugal. Italy isn't in that much trouble today. Spain had a balanced budget before the crisis. It were their banks that fucked it up. Same goes for Ireland.

I don't say the PIGS shouldn't reform. They definitely should. But I think we could give them some space and some breath to do this.

&gt;Personally, I think Greece should exit the EZ.

I believe we'll be getting on a very, very dangerous path then. This will cause the EZ to collapse. Once the possibility of leaving the EZ is certainly there. Every country in it will be targetted by speculators.

&gt;The EU is alive, maybe the EZ is not

I fear the EZ is too much intertwined with the EU to keep the EU safe after its fall. You need to remember why the EZ was formed. It was because of mass speculation against national currencies, in particular the Italian and the French currency.

I think that once we get rid of the EZ, the different countries aren't that safe at all. Alright, they could devaluate. But when everyone does that, it won't have any effect.

This will make the open market of the EU and the EU itself very unstable.

&gt;No one forced them to borrow money, and as I said, 98 % (!!!) in 1993. Also, what has made it hard for Greece is the rampant corruption, the tax evasion, the lack of industry etc......

And as I said, 125% for Belgium in 1993. No one forced the Greece indeed. But they made it possible. They didn't screen their clients at all.

There used to be a big discussion all over germany about pictures being taken in nightclubs.

By entering their club you agree that a picture of you might been taken, but the club owner has to make sure that the visitors are aware of this and delete the photos upon request. Yet still it is widespread common that the photographer asks for permission first and quite often he gives them a business card with information where they can find the photos and to contact the staff to delete them.

Ok, that just means that you are not taking care of your finances either. Rather reckless if you ask me in these times. There are a lot of reasons you are not where Greece is, for example you have more industy, you are not as corrupt, you don't have the same rampant tax evasion etc. That is also in now way an argument for me to hand over more money we have been doing that every day since we joined. And guess what - when we increased our retirement age, they decreased. We reformed our labour market, they didn't etc. Why are they not changing then?


&gt;But I think we could give them some space and some breath to do this.

What, apart from paying their salaries etc? How much breath do you need? Whos money are you planning on investing?  You do know that Greece haven't really implemented anything, Italy hasn't changed any of it labour laws, they re- elected Berlosconi etc. You are saying that we should *keep* giving them money, without proof. That is what we have been doing forever, and it has not worked - they have lived off that money. Enough! Also, you do understand that ""the breeding space"" you are referring to is money that comes from other peoples tax payers? It is easy to hand over other peoples money.  If you are so sure, why doesn't Belgium borrow a lot of money, hand it over to the Greeks (you seem to say that is no risk......). We would rather wait, but please, you go ahead.


'&gt;Well, I think this only really applies to Greece and maybe Protugal. Italy isn't in that much trouble today. Spain had a balanced budget before the crisis. It were their banks that fucked it up. Same goes for Ireland.

No, it's not just about the banks, although I wish it was. Yes, the immidiate crises, but that is not what brought Greece to it's knees, or southern Italys corruption. Italy has had a low growth for years, refused to deal with rigid bureacracy, rigid labour laws etc. 


&gt;I believe we'll be getting on a very, very dangerous path then. This will cause the EZ to collapse. Once the possibility of leaving the EZ is certainly there.


So, if you can't handle the heat - get out.  Or, you could see it as if you refuse to reform, lie, cheat and have no industry, you shouldn't be there to begin with. Cut the dead weight. Yes, I know that maybe other countries will fall, but perhaps they need to fall then. You keep on asking money for your pet project, which was ill though off to begin with (fincancial integration without political).

&gt;I fear the EZ is too much intertwined with the EU to keep the EU safe after its fall.

What, so. So you mean that we are not going to have a free custom union if the EZ falls? I can't work in the Netherlands any more? Of course the EU is there, just set back a bit, think about it as EU back in 98 or something. Hardly the end of the world, maybe that will teach the politicans some lessons. 


&gt;Of course it's not the fault of the lenders now, but they're not free from blame either

That is not what you are hearing from a lot of the countries in the debt crises. Also, while they are not guilt free (the lenders), these countries essentially created this situation for themselves (compare with the Baltics, with Finland, with Sweden, the different crises over there, also created by the countries themselves, and solved by themselves). All of a sudden we should come running with money so that you ill though through pet project won't fall, so that countries don't have to change. Let it fall. We are all grown ups - why not face the consequenses of once actions. If it's that bad, maybe it has to fall, you can start again in 10-20 years time if you like.

I myself think that what the EU needs is separation of crisis policies and institutions dealing with them. 

* Banking crises should be handled by European FDIC and SEC with backing of the ECB, this of course requires common banking regulations and a common regulator. 
* Structural crises would need a European IMF backed again with ECB, this would need even bigger reforms, like the ability of the EIMF set up punishments for member states failing to back emergency loans back to them, for example freezing their EU voting rights for a fixed time.

Not to mention that if Greece would leave the Euro and the worst would happen in a form of a Greek civil war, the rest of the Europe would need to quickly formulate policies and institutions to answer what needs to be done if a EU member state collapses or goes into a state of anarchy.

Hopefully the situation doesn't come to this and the EU and Greece can fix problems with out a serious escalation of the current crisis. It is not in the interest of anybody to fix issues after the damage has been done when they could have been fixed before.

There are a lot of reasons you are not where Greece is, for example you have more industy, you are not as corrupt, you don't have the same rampant tax evasion etc. That is also in now way an argument for me to hand over more money we have been doing that every day since we joined. And guess what - when we increased our retirement age, they decreased. We reformed our labour market, they didn't etc. Why are they not changing then?

It was not an argument to lend more money to Greece. You said it was already clear in 1993 what way Greece was going. But I just said that's untrue. Since our debt was higher in 1993 and we aren't in such troubles. I didn't meant to imply that it was some kind of argument. I just wanted to correct you on that small part.

&gt;What, apart from paying their salaries etc? How much breath do you need? Whos money are you planning on investing? You do know that Greece haven't really implemented anything, Italy hasn't changed any of it labour laws, they re- elected Berlosconi etc. You are saying that we should keep giving them money, without proof. That is what we have been doing forever, and it has not worked - they have lived off that money. Enough!

Breath to be able to get a decent stimulus plan ready. To tackle the high unemployment. To get the economy back on tracks. I thought they already implemented rules that lowered saleries, pension and raised the pension age. More of these rules are needed, but give them the time and space to do so. Suddenly cutting down half of the spendings won't help Greece either.

&gt;It is easy to hand over other peoples money. If you are so sure, why doesn't Belgium borrow a lot of money, hand it over to the Greeks (you seem to say that is no risk......). We would rather wait, but please, you go ahead.

Money from Belgium alone won't do the trick. But once a new plan is ready. Belgium will probably help. We always go with Europe.

&gt;No, it's not just about the banks, although I wish it was. Yes, the immidiate crises, but that is not what brought Greece to it's knees, or southern Italys corruption. Italy has had a low growth for years, refused to deal with rigid bureacracy, rigid labour laws etc. 

I said that in Spain it was caused by the banks only. Greece is indeed a different story.

&gt;Yes, I know that maybe other countries will fall, but perhaps they need to fall then. You keep on asking money for your pet project, which was ill though off to begin with (fincancial integration without political).

I don't think we ant the southern countries to fall. I don't think we will benefit from unstable, anarchistic countries near our borders. On the contrary. It's not impossible that militaristic dictators will rise.

I also don't think we should only integrate financially. Political integration would be needed too of course. More power to the European Parliament. Maybe a European government chosen by the Parliament?

&gt;What, so. So you mean that we are not going to have a free custom union if the EZ falls? I can't work in the Netherlands any more? Of course the EU is there, just set back a bit, think about it as EU back in 98 or something. Hardly the end of the world, maybe that will teach the politicans some lessons.

I don't think it will just go so smoothly. I think a lot of countries will fall once the Eurozone fall. Belgium included. Maybe only Germany will keep on standing. I'm not saying democracy will disappear in every EZ country, but I don't think every country will just go back to their old situation. Being happy. Holding hands with other countries.

Lets say I'm a hardworking fella' that has healthcare but didn't go on vacation and don't have a lot of 'toys', because the system is set up either i have toys or i have healthcare.

There's this place, if you like to drink, in Sol on Calle de los Jardines (just go up calle montera-the prostitute street-and you'll find it) it's called **Routers** and it does an open bar for 10€/hour and its beer, sangria and shots. If you want to go to the club ""joy"" they'll put you in line early to get in for free. 

If you go through Sol or Plaza Santa Ana, people will say ""come with me for free shots"" the shots suck. Sol is really all Americans and foreigners, especially during the summer. But, **El Tigre** in Chueca is a tourist must. Big drinks, lots of food. 

There's this place in Lavapies called **Melo's** and they have this huge sandwich for 10€ called the ""Zapatilla."" eat it.

El **Rastro** en La Latina is the ""flea market"" but is really just the same shops set up every Sunday in the same spot. Go before 11 and you won't be miserable in the crowds. It's really neat and you can buy all your touristy trinkets for half the price.

templo de debod is awesome for botellon

**Circular de Bellas Artes** for 2€ you get a gorgeous sight of Madrid and Cibeles.

For the day the Palacio Real is really neato and has a wonderful sunset, gran via is cool to walk around day and night, Retiro, the inside of the atocha train station is cool, sol, in Arguelles there's the **teleferico** which gives you a great view of the city.


ALSO 

there's like 60 something **100 montaditos** in Madrid, these places where you can get a jar of beer and a little sandwich for 2€. So you could get like 3 sandwiches that you like and a beer for 4€. Good place for a snack. 

Museos de Jamon have 1€ canas and 1€ sandwiches. 

**Valor** has great churros and chocolate, but in some barrios they have carts where you can buy a bag of churros and a tub of chocolate and sit in a park and munch. 

There's this low-key place in Tribunal called ""La Paloma Blanca"" that gives you plates and plates, though a little small, of tapas with your beer/wine. It's less crowded than El Tigre (Which now has a North and South location, although crowded still).

true,Norrsken,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Breath to be able to get a decent stimulus plan ready. To tackle the high unemployment. To get the economy back on tracks. I thought they already implemented rules that lowered saleries, pension and raised the pension age. More of these rules are needed, but give them the time and space to do so. Suddenly cutting down half of the spendings won't help Greece either.

Spending  what money?  From whom? Tax payers from where?  You do know if they actually paid their taxes, they wouldn't even have a budget deficit? So, why can't they start paying then. Six out of 10 actually pay no taxes what so ever. In Sweden 8 out of 10 pay. So I should work so the majority of Greeks don't have to pay? Come back when 7 out of 10 pays, then I will begin to talk. Since, according to you they are willing to change and the EU cans oversee those things, it shouldn't be a problem at all. You guys run along and fix that in a few years, and if you are right, I'll apologise and pay up a bit late, if I am right, you will not have spent even more of my money than you already have to.  What can go wrong ? (Apart from it's a black hole of corruption that you want to throw my money in). Honestly, that is the best and democratic way to go about it -you spend your money, I keep mine and we are both happy.You did say that we wouldn't be forced.  Oh, btw, they have lowered their pensions from 95 % (they had the highest in the OECD and their retirement age is now raised to 65...We have 67). 


Also, I have no idea where you get the idea of Greece cutting down half of their spendings. They haven't even made budget cuts of 1/10. Sweden's financial minister slammed them for that. He said they should at least be able to reach 15 % over three year, which they didn't. They essentially haven't made a lot of the things they promised they would do, but you want *my* money anyway. Not going to happen. 


&gt;I don't think we ant the southern countries to fall. I don't think we will benefit from unstable, anarchistic countries near our borders. On the contrary. It's not impossible that militaristic dictators will rise

Fall, or go through hash times. That is not the same you know, but yet you make them out to be. Oh, unemployment in Spain does not equal WWIII. I don't think they will fall, but I do  think it's better for a country to go through financial hardship on their own and change their ways, like the Baltic states did, like Sweden, like Finland. In the end it was very beneficial for us with the financial crises (when we received not a single cent from the EU,). We learned that one can't overspend, borrow money like there is no tomorrow, the need for an independent central bank etc. Above all, people and politicians alike developed a fear of none balanced budgets, to much debt etc. Perhaps southern Europe needs some of that. Throwing good money after bad is completely useless.


&gt;I don't think it will just go so smoothly. I think a lot of countries will fall once the Eurozone fall. Belgium included. Maybe only Germany will keep on standing. I'm not saying democracy will disappear in every EZ country, but I don't think every country will just go back to their old situation. Being happy. Holding hands with other countries. There will be a lot of manifestations and even riots. A lot of countries will lose a lot with the euro. A lot of people, banks and companies too.

Well, maybe you need it then, maybe we all need it. Don't build your house on sand if you want it to stand. In other words. Don't borrow to much, don't overspend, balance your budget, develop industries and be sensible. If you are not doing that, there is no help for you or anyone else in the long run. It will only prolong the agony if we keep handing over money. ",0,1336758521,null,0,false,0,c4mvpm9,t3_thkyp,t1_c4mvpm9,t1_c4mv1ec,null,1428904965,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;Honestly, that is the best and democratic way to go about it -you spend your money, I keep mine and we are both happy.You did say that we wouldn't be forced. Oh, btw, they have lowered their pensions from 95 % (they had the highest in the OECD and their retirement age is now raised to 65...We have 67

If some countries only want to help, there won't be enough aid, I think. It'd be better if we work together with the whole Union, or at least the whole Eurozone.

There needs to be democratic legitimacy indeed. I don't want anyone to be forced. But I do want to warn for the dangers if we don't help Greece.

Also, I really admire the Swedish model. I really think we should go into that direction with our country. But here the retirement age is also 65. But only about 20% of the people older than 60 still work. So in our little country there's also enough room for improvement on that part. This is not an argument, just something I wanted to add.

&gt;Also, I have no idea where you get the idea of Greece cutting down half of their spendings. They haven't even made budget cuts of 1/10. Sweden's financial minister slammed them for that. He said they should at least be able to reach 15 % over three year, which they didn't. They essentially haven't made a lot of the things they promised they would do, but you want my money anyway. Not going to happen. 

It was a retorical exaggeration. The fact that there are severe riots in Greece, that people are burning themselves alive made me think the budget cuts were very severe too. With actually no hope for a beter future, because it's possible the budget cuts are so severe it destroys the growth.

&gt;Oh, unemployment in Spain does not equal WWIII. I don't think they will fall, but I do think it's better for a country to go through financial hardship on their own and change their ways, like the Baltic states did, like Sweden, like Finland. In the end it was very beneficial for us with the financial crises

It's very admirable what the Scandinavian countries did in the 1990's (I don't know what happened in Sweden and in the Baltic States, but I do now of the banking crisis in Finland). But the process those countries went through, as did Germany by the way (although they went with another model), was in much more stable times than the southern European countries will have once they get kicked out the EZ. Also, there was in Finland a lot of spending and stimulus too. It wasn't only reforming and cutting. They raised public R&amp;D spending by 70% over 4 years (source: [7th paragraph](http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/the-innovation-gap-grows-wider/69156.aspx)). This is something Spain or Greece won't be able to do. Indeed, in the case of Greece, it's their own fault. But this means the transmission you speak of won't go so smoothly.

&gt;Well, maybe you need it then, maybe we all need it. Don't build your house on sand if you want it to stand. In other words. Don't borrow to much, don't overspend, balance your budget, develop industries and be sensible. If you are not doing that, there is no help for you or anyone else in the long run. It will only prolong the agony if we keep handing over money.

I don't think we need to learn the lesson in such a hard way. There are indeed flaws in the Eurozone and in a lot of European countries, especially when compared to the Scandinavian countries. And while the collapse of the Eurozone would be a very effective way to teach politicians and citizens some discipline, I don't think it will be very efficient. On the contrary. I feel like it wouldn't be worth all the trouble. Maybe it's better to muddle along for a while and progress slowly than to collapse first and then be rebuilded into a stronger nation.",0,1336765507,null,0,false,0,c4mxahe,t3_thkyp,t1_c4mxahe,t1_c4mvpm9,null,1428905703,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Well, in the end it is us, as tax payers, who foots the bill. That is why, in a sense it is personal when I see people protesting at retiring at 65 and I know we have 67, *I* get pissed off. But I'll start to write the countries. 

&gt;If some countries only want to help, there won't be enough aid

There's the difference between you and me. I honestly don't think we are helping them by handing over money Show me that they *are* changing, otherwise we are just aiding corruption and bad politics. You keep saying that they will change, but have the corruption become less since they joined the EU? No. Since the recession? No. 


 If you want money you will have to be very exact on how you are going to change (and nothing vague). Your claims that ""we will oversee so that there's no corruption"" is very.... unscientific and romantic,but not based in any reality whatsoever. Give me an exact plan how you are going to punish the Greeks who don't pay taxes and get them to stop tax evasion. What year exactly are they going to be on par with the Netherlands in tax paying? Your reasoning migh be noble and kind, but I think you are doing more harm than good. If the EU/EZ had stopped handing over money decades ago, they would have had to deal with it. Now they have to - finally. 


&gt;I don't think we need to learn the lesson in such a hard way. There are indeed flaws in the Eurozone and in a lot of European countries, especially when compared to the Scandinavian countries. And while the collapse of the Eurozone would be a very effective way to teach politicians and citizens some discipline, I don't think it will be very efficient. On the contrary. I feel like it wouldn't be worth all the trouble. Maybe it's better to muddle along for a while and progress slowly than to collapse first and then be rebuilded into a stronger nation


Not learn the lessons in such a hard way. Hmm -  there's been trouble since, 2008. Have they learned their lessons which you say that they are doing?  Hmm - tax evasion rampant as ever (Greece, Southern Italy). More borrowing (everybody). Corruption - more. Balancing budgets - no.  Voting for Berlusconi - again. Refuse to raise retirement age, refuse to reform labour laws/bureacracy etc. Honestly, would you say that this behaviour is from countries who's  grasping the seriousness of the situation and learning their lessons?

No, of course not, they haven't learned a single damn thing. Something has to happen, and since handing over trillions over Euros (yes, the EZ has been having stimulus programs, IMF funds etc) obviously doesn't help since that has ben done since forever , something has to change. I say, the proof is up to you now. Show me the changes,show me how the Greeks are just dying to pay taxes, the Italians will throw out all their corrupt little clowns etc - then we can talk. 

It appears that they do have to learn their lessons the hard way, since they seemed to have learned nothing. 

Finally, thank you for your kind words about Nordic countries, but there are a lot of flaws here too...- a lot (crime, immigration, idiotic people etc). I know Finland did handle their crises pretty well, and I think one of the things that worked in their advantage was a sense of togetherness, we have to pull through, together, as Finns. I also know that they  increased their spending, but that was with their money, not with anyone elses. I am however endlessly teasing them about the Euro now, and that pisses them off. (long rivalry with Finnish friends :-).. Honestly, they think they pulled together, why can't other countries? And, hardly anyone I know think money sent down south is spent wisely.. It probably is because it isn't. .I mean, where would you invest in research  you talked about ? Southern Italy? Or Finland? 

&gt;Also, I really admire the Swedish model. I really think we should go into that direction with our country. 

Don't, do the Belgian model instead, it will probably be better. We have really high taxes etc. I have understood however you have the two biggest problems for Belgium is you debt/GDP and the fact that you are deeply divided as a country, so it will be interesting to see how you go about that.

I unashamedly plan to become rich to the point where I am in the 1%. I don't have any real desire for expensive material things or obscene displays of wealth, don't plan to buy an expensive car or a big house. The reason I want to become rich is simple, I want the freedom and choices that it offers. I want to be able to influence things in a positive way, be creative, solve problems, donate money to worthwhile causes, fund new technologies that are good for humanity and spend as much of the small amount of time I have in this life on meaningful and worthwhile experiences, with family, through travel, education and creativity. With this I am making a trade-off to live like others are not prepared to, so later on I can live like others are unable to. 

I am in the same the broke ass situation as most people at the moment and when I consider how I intend to make money, every single potential option is calculated with probability which ultimately influences the life decisions I make. In order to increase my probability, I ultimately have to make sacrifices or take decision based on how it will increase my chances. Luck will be involved, but much like a game of poker, my strategy will play a big role in success or failure and to put it frankly I don't want to sat on a table with a bunch of amateurs who are there for fun, to win big I need to advance to the final/top table as quickly as I can.  
 
I have come to accept that I will more than likely fail at points, take on emotional stress, live in substandard conditions, have to relocate, sacrifice parts of my social and personal life and even after a decade or so of doing this I might still end up in a situation where I am worse of than if I had played it safe and worked on a secure career.

As I graduate a large strategic decision lays in front of me, which can affect my chances and it's that of location. I see myself as global citizen, I have already lived in five countries and enjoyed every one for different reasons, if my chances of success are higher in a particular country and there are no barriers to stop me relocating, I would do so in an instant. 

The main thing that I take into account with location is the network opportunities that come with it, investors, partners, business associates, media, business clusters, mentors, ect. If I am to learn skills that can be utilised I want to do so under the wing of other successful people and in a young company I can help grow and be meeting people that can strategically help me along the way of my journey. If a location is lacking these my chances are likely to be significantly lowered. The second is ease of doing business, mainly as it connected to the first, but also that it will eat into my time and lowers my chances. Taking this decision means assessing the whether this is likely to improve or decline, as a business environment that is growing is easier to get into at a low level than one that is declining.  

The French tax on wealth alone would not be the thing that encourages me to leave, it would be the outcomes that it causes, investors and people that already have the freedom to move doing so, a lack of innovation clusters, the negative attitudes towards my choices and the fact that many people who think like me are likely to make similar choices in relocation.

The other factor is that the more tax I pay if I sell a company or make in wages, the lower my chances of financial freedom and later it will likely come. If I choose to make the sacrifices and I succeed, the more money I lose to tax the less likely I am to reach my goal of financial independence and if that goal is never possible due to tax I will choose not to make the sacrifices at all and take a job and life decisions based on other criteria.

This is something I also said. It's important there is a plan, a decent, concrete plan. But you said Greece should change first, before receiving the money. This is something different. I don't think Greece has the room to change in the current situation (with bond yields of 15%+). We should back them up, give them some space. But there should be a plan of course.

I think you're a bit too harsh with your analysis.

The borrowing isn't right. Since the crisis, private persons/institutions in the developped countries are saving more than they spent, even in the United States and also in the PIGS countries.

The balancing of the budget is really something the governments try to work towards. Especially in Italy with Monti and in Spain with Rajoy. In Greece it's just very hard to balance the budget because of the interest of 15%+ they need to pay. But it would be unfair to say that they didn't try anything to balance their budget.

These things also mostly only count for Greece, Italy and a bit for Portugal. Another country that is in trouble is Spain, while they really had a decent economy. Nice budget, few debt. But their housing market simply collapsed and the banks went with it. A quarter of the people are now out of work. And Spain really follows the European austerity plan.

&gt;I also know that they increased their spending, but that was with their money, not with anyone elses.

This is true. They had the possibility to do this. The PIGS countries absolutely don't.

We also have very high taxes. But not on consumption like in Sweden, but on labour, which results in a pretty rigid labour market. And the taxes in Sweden are better spent. Way better. We have 6 governments and 6 parliaments to pay.

Our debt isn't such a big problem actually. We have a lot of debt, but it's in our own hands. Belgian government bonds are very popular among the Belgians.

true,Norrsken,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;I don't think Greece has the room to change in the current situation (with bond yields of 15%+). We should back them up, give them some space. But there should be a plan of course.

Why should II back up people who has been digging a whole since the 80's and are absolutely refusing to stop, even at this moment. I think they (and other countries) have to change first. What do you mean, not room. What stops them from paying taxes (the majority of the population pay none)?  Nothing! As I have said, they have not improved for the better, not even done the things they promised to do, so far. Why not?  What stops them - really? Give me proof. You do know they haven't even implented the things that they said the would - how you do respond to that? 

&gt;This is something I also said. It's important there is a plan, a decent, concrete plan.

Good- you do know that they don't even have a centralised proper system for whos owns what house (since then you could pay taxes). Number 80 on the corruption list. 80!  What year, are 70 % of them going to paying taxes? You can't answer that. Don't you think people haven't tried - and you are saying this time it will be different. That is beyond naive actually. Be reckless with Belgiums money, not with ours. No, the only one who can change Greece is the Greeks, and this time, it's their time to show that they actually willing to change. You still haven't disputed any of my claims for Greece and offered me no proof whatsoever. You do know that they haven't balanced a budget since 1973? Proof - or, let the Belgians pay for them. It's down the black corruption hole. 


&gt;The balancing of the budget is really something the governments try to work towards. Especially in Italy with Monti and in Spain with Rajoy. In Greece it's just very hard to balance the budget because of the interest of 15%+ they need to pay. But it would be unfair to say that they didn't try anything to balance their budget.

&gt;These things also mostly only count for Greece, Italy and a bit for Portugal. Another country that is in trouble is Spain, while they really had a decent economy. Nice budget, few debt. But their housing market simply collapsed and the banks went with it. A quarter of the people are now out of work. And Spain really follows the European austerity plan.

No, I am not to harsh, and don't think I didn't noticed that you didn't mention the corruption in any of the countries/Berlusconi/tax evasion. Have the people changed their ways there - have they? There has to be a will to change- you do not want to if you re-elect Berlusconi or don't pay your taxes. Italians don't want a balanced budget. If they did, why did they re-elect that corrupt man. Monti was forced upon them, he is not elected.Besides, you need to do more than to balance budgets, you have to reform the labour market etc. Have they? No. So, why should I support them then? 


&gt;This is true. They had the possibility to do this. The PIGS countries absolutely don't.

First, research is not going to help them at this very moment. Second, they, like everyone else, will have to spend their own money, not Sweden's. They can find money, but they have to change their labour laws and start paying taxes. If they did, they wouldn't need our money. So, A) either taking money from tax paying Swedes and letting tax evaders get away with it - again. *Or* B) starting to pay taxes that are less than we pay, anyway. 

You are choosing option A, which is basically teaching them to get away with it and continue down this path. As I've said - you are letting corruption win, you are feeding it. 


I agree a bit about Spain - so fine, help them and let the others loose then. Italy is to big anyway.  I am certainly not the only one saying that Greece should go. I think that is the only way. I am so tired of countries not owning up and throwing good money after bad. They all knew what they were doing, why don't they, for once, carry the consequences of their own decision.

&gt;and don't think I didn't noticed that you didn't mention the corruption in any of the countries/Berlusconi/tax evasion.

&gt;You are choosing option A, which is basically teaching them to get away with it and continue down this path. As I've said - you are letting corruption win, you are feeding it. 

To be clear about this. I don't want Greece to get the money to be able to keep paying way too high pensions to 62 year olds. I want Europe to help Greece set up a stimulus plan. Job creation via infrastructure and labour subsidies. This is something that Greece can't do today. Their debt is way too high and cutting alone can't get the budget under control. They need to get their economy back on track. Our money could help here. Not giving it away but lending it, at a decent interest rate that is higher than the inflation (maybe 4%, max 5%). The purpose of the plan is to get Greece's economy back on the rails so they can eventually repay most their debts and get their bond yield under the critical level of 6%. Labour market reforms are indeed necessairy, corruption and mass tax evasion absolutely inacceptable. I know they are now there in Greece. But corruption isn't that hard to control when you are the lender. When corruption is detected you can raise your interest rates and force the corrupted to stand trial. Tax evasion is somewhat harder. But to battle it, there is also need for money. You need a lot of officials to get a grip on tax evasion.

If we don't help Greece this way, it will be forced out of the Eurozone. Once the possibility of leaving the Eurozone is not only a fantasy anymore, speculators will be targetting other countries: Spain, Italy, Ireland or even Belgium and France. The Eurozone will collapse.

This is a scenario we need to prevent. The collapse of the Eurozonee won't be good for anyone. Some kind of lesson in discipline might be learned. But at what cost?

true,Norrsken,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Does 50% of the Greeks evade taxes?

Yes, of course. I have links of course to the dire situation, here are some: 

[6 out of 10 Greeks don't pay taxes](http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-31/world/greece.taxes_1_income-taxes-greek-press-tax-evasion?_s=PM:WORLD). [Link 1](http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2012/02/04/feature-02) [Link 2](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8585593/Greece-loses-15bn-a-year-to-tax-evasion.html), [Link 3](http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012-01-29/tax-evaders-greece-spain-italy/52822942/1). 

Honestly, I can sit and give you links all day about the rampant corruption, but I hope you notice that they also mentions Spain, Portugal and Italy. I haven't even started about that everyone writes down their income (so they don't have to pay), when they retiered (after 30 years, or at 60, with 95 % of the salary of the last 5 years). It is *everywhere* so no one is doing anything about it. So, again, why should my money go there?  You can't give me proof that they have changed, bcause they have not. 

&gt;I don't want Greece to get the money to be able to keep paying way too high pensions to 62 year olds.

Maybe not as high anymore, but pensions - yes, you pay for that. While 25 % of the Greek economy is a shadow economy (and not taxed of course). That number has increased btw, so I think they are actually doing the opposite, they are digging themselves deeper into the hole. 


&gt;I want Europe to help Greece set up a stimulus plan. Job creation via infrastructure and labour subsidies. 

Europe have been doing that since the joined in the 80's. Who the XXX do you think paid for the (before it was basically free, no one ever checked)subway in Athens? Who has paid for their generous benefits. They have four times as many school teachers as Finland ( but just double the poplation), yet, most children need extra teaching to pass. How?  Honestly, do you think they haven't received all that before? If they receive a simulus plan, do you think they will go - oh, now I'd love to start paying taxes. It's a cultural thing, they do not do that. As I said - change first. Again, throwing good money after bad.......


&gt;They need to get their economy back on track.

I don't know if it ever were on track really. What companies do they have? They have their shipping industry (down 27 % in last 10 years), tourism (down as well), and then what? A lot of super small businesses. Yet, they have increased their salaries with 40 % in the last 10-15 years, compare that to Germany. They should have been building up industries, but didn't. They are not going to do it now. 


&gt;Not giving it away but lending it, at a decent interest rate that is higher than the inflation (maybe 4%, max 5%).

You do that. Our finance minister has said no, they are not even doing the things they promised to do in the *first* bailout. We would rather invest ours/pay off our own debt etc.


&gt;But corruption isn't that hard to control when you are the lender. When corruption is detected you can raise your interest rates and force the corrupted to stand trial.

Really, do you think people who work in sub Saharan Africa, southern Italy and Greece haven't though about that. It's not that they have one shady individual, everyone is. You seriously can't think that corruption can be stamped out like that. I am sorry to say that, you are really very, very, very naive if you believe that. And, might I add, wrong. 


&gt;You need a lot of officials to get a grip on tax evasion.

They are the most corrupt.


&gt;If we don't help Greece this way, it will be forced out of the Eurozone. Once the possibility of leaving the Eurozone is not only a fantasy anymore, speculators will be targetting other countries: Spain, Italy, Ireland or even Belgium and France. The Eurozone will collapse.


Perhaps, perhaps not. If it collaps it's because it was too poorly built and then it needs to go. I know that Sweden shouldn't sponsor corruption, irresponsibility, rigid labour markets, tax evasion. I'd rather you fall then. We will all suffer, but maybe we will finally learn something. If you read FT, Wall Street Journal etc, none is to upset about it now. The only two reasons to save it is really A) save the Euro.But then, if the Euro is so fragile it can be brought down by Greece, it has to fall. Also, it is mad to have same currenc, but difference politics etc 

B) Because you feel sorry for the Greeks. I do feel sorry for them, but really, it beyond helping and they are just digging their hole deeper and deeper every day.

Absolutely not.

From the [original article](http://translate.google.com/translate?langpair=el|en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tovima.gr%2Fafieromata%2Felections2012%2Farticle%2F%3Faid%3D457088) (Google Translate):

&gt; In most of the polling stations where police officers vote, along with other citizens, the percentage of Golden Dawn ranges from 19-24%, and is the largest observed across the capital. 

He writes about some of Police's polling stations  in the City of Athens (not the metropolitan area), where citizens also vote (including those temporarily held), and still 76-81% did not vote for Golden Dawn.

How he ends up with ""more than half"", is beyond my understanding. ""More that half"" in mathematics would be ""more than 50%"" everywhere. Besides, [Hellenic Police](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_Police)'s forces have more than 50,000 members. Golden Dawn did not receive more than 25,000 votes from them. Anyone can check ekloges.ypes.gr and do the math.

I've seen Facebook posts a few days ago about it. Some blogs picked it and it ended on a mainstream publication. Good to see high journalistic standards in action.

Edit: trying to figure out his reasoning.

He says:

&gt; ...a few hundred meters nearby, in Tsoha St.'s polling stations, where police officers don't vote (note: he means exclusively, blame his syntax), Golden Dawn's percentage drops to 12-14%. Bearing in mind that on average, in each on of these polling stations, as shown in the electoral roll, approximately 550-700 people voted, and the number of police officers voting there ranges from 20%-30% of the total votes cast, then with the relative reduction the percentage of police officers voting for Golden Dawn ranges between 45%-59%.

So, by now we've established that he talks about ""half of the police officers"", in some polling stations near the Police Headquarters, in a neighbourhood of the 7th district of the City of Athens! Nice case, huh? ""1 in 2 Greek cops votes Nazis"". Pulitzer prize, here he comes.

But let's examine the case.

He says that up to 30% of the voters in these polling stations are police officers. There is no way of obtaining such data, occupation is not recorded in the electoral roll (and I'm guessing he didn't stand outside of each polling station from 07:00-19:00, asking everyone if he/she was a cop). Nevertheless, Golden Dawn's largest percentage in these polling stations was 14%. The largest possible percentage of police officers in them, according to his ""data"" (I imagine him thinking: ""Police HQ nearby, let's give it 20-30%""), is 30%. Do you see where he's going? If up to 30% of the hypothetical cops voted there, and Golden Dawn took 14%, then divide 14 by 30 and half of the hypothetical cops voted for Golden Dawn! Because, you know, it's impossible for citizens to vote for Golden Dawn, or for cops to vote for other parties (as the vast majority of them did, in polling stations where they vote in large numbers, as the same journalist wrote above)!

In reality, as shown in the results, more police officers (hypothetical or not) voted for the parties of the Left, than those who voted for Golden Dawn.

(By the way, Golden Dawn's voters were 440,000. In the previous election, they were 20,000. If ""half of the police officers"" vote for them, then we're missing 5,000 votes from 2009.)

Slightly unrelated: since more than 250 million Americans already purchase private health insurance voluntarily, they wouldn't be affected by a mandate at all. Which means that a mandate would really only affect a few dozen million Americans, and many of those would probably be very happy to be able to purchase health insurance in the first place. It therefore seems that implementing a mandate in order to achieve universal health care would be a lot easier than converting the entire system to a national health care system, and then implementing a health care tax in order to pay for it.",0,1336781432,null,0,false,0,c4n0k3g,t3_ti1xo,t1_c4n0k3g,t1_c4n0a7v,null,1428907242,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I'm not residing in Wiesbaden anymore, so I can't help your mom in person.  
But I have spent some time there and my parents are still living there, so what I can do is give your mom some spots to visit.  


It would help if you'd have told us how old she is, if she has Internet access and if she has a car or has to use public transportation, but whatever. 


Disclaimer: all adresses in Wiesbaden unless stated otherwise. I'll name the nearest bus stop and the bus lines driving there (Line: Name of [bus] stop). Routes can easily be planned at [RMV.de/en/](http://www.rmv.de/en/), the local public transport organisation.


Let's start with the basics - food. I'll go from takeaway to fancyness:  


Moritz Kebap Haus, Moritzstraße (Lines 6, 7: Adelheidstraße) - imo the best Döner in Wiesbaden. C'mon, she is in Germany, can't skip this one   

Pizza Express, Kaiser-Friedrich-Ring 38 (Lines 1, 8, 5, 15: Schiersteiner Straße) - Pizza to-go and a good one at that. May be personal bias because I lived really near to them, but they are in business since 1984. Can't be all that bad. Phone number for orders: 0611/301137. Don't know if they speak English though  

perfect day / Drei Frauenzimmer, Kirchgasse 29 (almost all: Platz der deutschen Einheit) - in midst of the inner city pedestrian zone you have this wonderful little bagel shop. Grab some coffee and a bagel or a delicious focaccia and go upstairs!  

Fasan, Friedrichstraße 57 (almost all: Platz der deutschen Einheit) - now I don't know how they'll react to Americans, but I have only one word for this Afghan restaurant (also conveniently located in the inner city): DELICIOUS  
 
Goldgasse (almost all: Kirchgasse, walk 5 mins)- no restaurant this time, but a street in the inner city pedestrian zone, where restaurant follows restaurant. If your mom craves english conversation, she can stop at the Irish pub there :P  

Sherry &amp; Port, Adolfsallee 11 (Lines 6, 7: Landeshaus) - take a look at the [menu](http://sherry-und-port.de/Eng_Karte_83.pdf). come early, it gets crowded. and not cheap either. but worth it.  

Himmelreich, Freudenbergstraße (Line 23: Sonnenblumenweg) - no food guide to Wiesbaden would be perfect without a tip for a good 'Apfelweinstube' (serving local food and the local alcoholic specialty Applewine). This is by far my favorite in Wiesbaden. Located just on the outskirts of Wiesbaden, this tavern is an excellent start or end to a great hiking tour into the vineyards of the Rheingau. The not able to walk foot thingy sucks because that really is awesome.   

Weingut Höhn, Freudenbergstraße 200 (Line 23: Sonnenblumenweg) - an excellent restaurant to end a great hiking tour. notice a pattern? :) That's because it's like 300 meters away from the Apfelweinstube Himmelreich. But while the former is hearty and simple, Höhn doesn't only serve some of the best wine in Wiesbaden (from their own vine of course), they also serve excellent food.  

I'd love to point to a really 'typical German restaurant', but the only one I really liked turned to an Italian restaurant a few years ago. Ah well, that's it for the food.  


Next up - nice spots to visit:  

Kochbrunnen, Kochbrunnenplatz (Line 1, 8: Kochbrunnen) - ho-hummm, the translation would be ""boiling well"". And that's what it is. A spot where boiling water comes out of a built well. Nothing fancy, but just located where the pedestrion zone ends and near the Radisson hotel lol. There is a small public festival in a few weeks at the plaza there, that's nice.  

Kurhaus/Casino (Lines 1, 2, 16, 60: Kurhaus/Theater): I guess she has been there already. The only place where Wiesbaden looks simply stunning.   
Kurpark: located behind the Kurhaus/Casino is a really nice park where she can take a walk and refresh.  


Reduit Mainz-Kastel (Lines 6, 9, 28, 54-57, 68: Brückenkopf): There are many nice spots at the shores of the river Rhine. The Reduit is one of my favorites. Go eat on the ship-turned-restaurant, chill at the sandy beach, party in and around the Reduit or just take a stroll along the river.  

Schiersteiner Hafen (Lines 23, 63: [Schiersteiner] Hafen): as I said, there are many beautiful spots at the river Rhine. This is like the perfect starting point to take a refreshing walk or bike along the river.  

Neroberg (Line 1: Nerotal): take a short walk or better take the Nerobergbahn, a little water powered cable car, up this little hill. Great view over all of Wiesbaden and a [really nice little church](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Russische_Kirche_%22Griechische_Kapelle%22_auf_dem_Neroberg_in_Wiesbaden.jpg/448px-Russische_Kirche_%22Griechische_Kapelle%22_auf_dem_Neroberg_in_Wiesbaden.jpg).  


HOLY SHIT this took way longer than I wanted it to. And now I read she has a bum foot QQ   

Okay, just one thing:  

Hainerberg Army Post - Wiesbaden has the largest US Army Post in whole Europe. Tell her to not be afraid to speak English, we are fucking used to it. At the Hainerberg she can find an arrangement of US fast food joint like Popeyes, Taco Bell, McD, BK and whatnot. The American supermarket is only open to soldiers I think.


Spots outside of Wiesbaden (do your own research :P): Rheingau, Kloster Eberbach (where The name of the rose was filmed) and maybe the English Theatre in Frankfurt. Frankfurt anyway.


I hope she enjoys her stay after all!",0,1336782404,null,0,false,0,c4n0ptl,t3_tiprx,t1_c4n0ptl,t3_tiprx,null,1428907327,17,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,17

true,W00ster,NORW,Norway,"&gt; Thats a rather crass generalization  
  
Sure it is... But it is also based upon close to 20 years of living and working in the US. I have no illusions about Norway being a paradise either but there is no doubt that in every aspect of life, from conception until grave, the average American would have been better off having been born in Norway (or any other Nordic country for that matter).  
  
Many people point to the US as special and uses billionaires as an example but if one look at Forbes Magazines list of billionaires, one will quickly realize that a certain amount of people is needed to support a single billionaire. Currently the number is somewhere around 1 million people/billionaire. The US and Norway have both a rate of less than 1 million/billionaire but the US has a higher rate due to overall paying less to employees in wages. The Nordic countries and numerous other European countries are fairly evenly matched in the rate and currently Germany seems like the best bet if you are aiming toward becoming the next billionaire.  
  
Here in the US with a rather high unemployment, they could have benefited from introducing paid maternity leave as it would require more people to be working, lowering unemployment and improving children's health and future chances in life. But that would be ""European socialism"" as GOP and the right is calling it and the Democrats are way too spineless to suggest any such thing.

Second book is ""Das Jahrhundert Ludewigs des XIV. Aus dem Französischen des Herrn von Voltaire"" - ""The Century of Louis XIV., translated from the French of Mr Voltaire""

The newer letter could be an attempt at explaining the older one:  
""""The early baroque document should be a 'Zahlungsorder' from the time of the Queen Mother or from the time of the young Richelieu. This document contains at least two different handwritings.  
It is from the last days of the militant disputes in France, which were ended by Richelieu's intermediation.""

However, the the handwritten line correctly states Richelieu's birth year, i.e. he wasn't born in 1570. The old letter seems to be in French, though.

Edit: Forgot to explain 'Zahlungsorder': I'm not sure if this translates to some kind of cheque or an invoice. ",0,1336793062,null,0,true,0,c4n2g76,t3_tj5gh,t1_c4n2g76,t3_tj5gh,null,1428908201,14,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,14

Warum sollte man einen so schwerwiegenden Eingriff ausgerechnet in den Teil des Rechts über immaterielle Güter vornehmen, der ""die Kleinen schützt"", indem er den Erwerb des Rechts an so niedrige Hürden koppelt. Dadurch, dass ich automatisch das Urheberrecht habe, kann ich mir ein Lizenzmodell auswählen, das am besten zu mir und meinem Werk passt. Und dass Interessen an der selektiven Verbreitung nur des eigenen Werks nur kommerziell sein können, ist ein phantasieloser Gedanke. Ich möchte verfügen dürfen, dass meine Werke nicht in Erzeugnissen der Murdochschen News Corporation reproduziert werden dürfen.

Abgesehen von der Frage, was man nicht automatisch erhalten sollte: Gerade das Beispiel zeigt, dass es sich ohne Gesetzesänderung machen lässt. Der Hoster fügt jedem Bild eine einfache Wahlmöglichkeit für das Lizenzmodell  (und beim Anmelden eine grundsätzliche Defaulteinstellung) bei.

Was ich mir vorstellen könnte, wäre zu fordern, dass anonym publizierte Werke, sofern nicht anders beschrieben, CC0 oder ähnlich maximalfrei lizensiert sind, oder sogar weitergehend, dass der Rechteinhaber Möglichkeiten einräumen muss, für Nutzungsangaben erreichbar zu sein, wenn er im Zweifel auf sein Recht pochen will.

Since the 16th century, collections of translations of the prayer have often been used for a quick comparison of languages

It's not a 'local problem', it's a moral obligation for people to help those around them. But then why localise it when it's entirely possible to start with those at the bottom? Your 'separating of the issue' is an easy way of ignoring the problems that exist.

Sure there's exploitation in the the third world. There's exploitation everywhere simply because the 'exploited' are offered an option better than the alternative. The 'exploitation' that you see it actually better than the poverty that you don't. The rise of western civilisation is built on this 'exploitation'.

There seems to be this idea that 'poverty' is created somehow. In fact, we as humans and animals are born in poverty. There is no such thing as a limited amount of 'wealth' in the world and some people have just selfishly taken more than their share. 'Wealth', or whatever represents it, is created through exchange of productive effort.

This idea, coincidentally, fits perfectly with any government (the EU now) - having the power to make moral decisions for people is not something that any authority would ever give up. It's moral laziness that keeps it there, the idea that 'government will fix it' allows you to be sanctimonious in your own support for the benevolent authority that's going to fix all poverty and make the world a fairer place.

&gt;6 out of 10 Greeks don't pay taxes. Link 1 Link 2, Link 3.

&gt;Honestly, I can sit and give you links all day about the rampant corruption, but I hope you notice that they also mentions Spain, Portugal and Italy.

&amp;

&gt;While 25 % of the Greek economy is a shadow economy (and not taxed of course). That number has increased btw, so I think they are actually doing the opposite, they are digging themselves deeper into the hole. 

I read there is a loss of 15bn euros by tax evasion... Not much better here then...[ 20bn euros according to the socialist labour union](http://www.flanderstoday.eu/content/tax-evasion-costs-%E2%82%AC20-billion-year). Same goes for the shadow economy: [17%. And that's under the European mean of 19,4%...](http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/news/1.1050038)

&gt;So, again, why should my money go there? You can't give me proof that they have changed, bcause they have not. 

Well I gave you a list of reforms, cuts and tax increases Greece implemented. I can't give you more. So I guess I'll take your point on that one. Tax evasion and corruption is just very hard to tackle. You can't get this done within a few months. They don't have the time right now to get that fixed. They can only implement some measurements on the short term. But battling shadow economy is really a long term operation.

&gt;Europe have been doing that since the joined in the 80's. Who the XXX do you think paid for the (before it was basically free, no one ever checked)subway in Athens? Who has paid for their generous benefits. They have four times as many school teachers as Finland ( but just double the poplation), yet, most children need extra teaching to pass. How? Honestly, do you think they haven't received all that before? If they receive a simulus plan, do you think they will go - oh, now I'd love to start paying taxes. It's a cultural thing, they do not do that. As I said - change first. Again, throwing good money after bad.

The mess they're into today is more because of their long term trade deficit than because of their lack of taxes. I believe in a stimulus plan because it could create jobs. Jobs create tax money. Ofcourse the tax money should be paid as well. Income taxes should also apply on people who earn less than €12k a year (here it's 6k).

&gt;I don't know if it ever were on track really. What companies do they have? They have their shipping industry (down 27 % in last 10 years), tourism (down as well), and then what? A lot of super small businesses. Yet, they have increased their salaries with 40 % in the last 10-15 years, compare that to Germany. They should have been building up industries, but didn't. They are not going to do it now. 

I fear I have to agree with you on this one (only for Greece). Though on the short term they could get back on tourism, fishing and agriculture (olives). On the long run again, there are more severe measurements needed. This is something you want to see first, I understand that. But I'm not willing to take the risk that the euro falls.

&gt;Perhaps, perhaps not. If it collaps it's because it was too poorly built and then it needs to go. I know that Sweden shouldn't sponsor corruption, irresponsibility, rigid labour markets, tax evasion. I'd rather you fall then. We will all suffer, but maybe we will finally learn something. If you read FT, Wall Street Journal etc, none is to upset about it now. The only two reasons to save it is really A) save the Euro.But then, if the Euro is so fragile it can be brought down by Greece, it has to fall. Also, it is mad to have same currenc, but difference politics etc

&gt;B) Because you feel sorry for the Greeks. I do feel sorry for them, but really, it beyond helping and they are just digging their hole deeper and deeper every day. 

I think this is really the main point in the discussion. I'm not willing to sacrifice the euro indeed so we might learn some lessons out of it. It's probably just as likely that radical right &amp; radical left become dangerously popular in whole of Europe and 0 lessons will be learned.

Also, that a monetary zone wouldn't be able to withstand the fall of one of its members, doesn't make it a too fragile zone. That's pretty normal.

Despite of that you want to keep on throwing money at them.

I think doing that is stupid, reckless, and not saving anything in the long run. *But*, if you want to do it - please go ahead. Sponsor Greek tax evaders to your dying days if that is what you want, run your economy in the ground because you can't control Italy. Just do it. Everyone goes to hell in their own way I suppose. 

What you are *not* allowed to do, but keep on doing anyway is putting pressure on us to participate. Claiming EU money for helping the *Eurozone*. You, and *a lot* of other people have been doing that. There's immensense pressure that we *should help out* - why. The only reason is to save a completely ill thought of pet project of some countries who are willing to sacrifise sense and finances and sponsor corruption just not to loose face or actually go back and redesign it so it works. That is beyond stupid.

The IMF wants more money, the EU wants more money (the EP had the audacity to suggest we should pay more, since they need more), you keep on claiming that we have to help out. The *EU* is creating projets to help out on situations caused by the *Eurozone*. You have no right to do it - it's not only financially reckless (they way you are doing this have actually manage to get a lot of Swedes not only to question the Euro, but the EU), but undemocratic and *corrupt*. The money weren't given to the EU to be used by the Eurozone. You are corrupting the whole of the EU, just because *you* have a pet project and want to pay for Greece for the forseeable future. The Eurozone is corrupting the EU more. You have no right to do it, yet, you are dragging us down with you. I am rather willing at the moment, to leave the EU. No use hanging around corruption, handing over money to non -democratic projects.No one, can even offer a half assed solution to anything, as long as you keep on demanding to save the Euro.

The fact of the matter is that Greece isn't productive enough to sustain their current standard of living. Largely this is because the public sector that is too large and inefficient, and which prevents the private sector to work at full speed. This is the crux of the problem in Greece. The only way to tackle this is austerity that cuts down public sector, preferably by cutting down number of persons working for the state and not by simply cutting down their salaries.

Of course shredding public sector jobs will increase unemployment. This should be countered by injection of money into the economy in form of investments, however in both Greece and Spain states are incompetent to do that, thus money would need to be injected into the private sector. However doing this in form of setting up European institutions and policies to do that are hard and can fail. And still, there would be large scale long term unemployment in all troubled states as it is hard for people transform from doing something to doing something else.

I would also like to add that... 

* Increasing wages of German workers doesn't necessarily work. In highly developed economies where wages are already quite high, increase of wages will lead to increase of automation and decrease of manufacturing workforce. For example in Japan there are 295 robots per 10000 worker while in Germany 163 and in Spain 84, while the European average is 50.
* Money doesn't just disappear. While wages of German workers haven't grew, profits of German companies have went up and so has dividends that they have paid to their stockholders. Holders of capital of course like to invest that it and not to consume it, but that is just another opportunity. Maybe if southern European states had more capitalistic economies with more market friendly policies there would be more private investment to them.

Lastly, I think that blaming Germany is little bit short-sighted. While Germany is a major actor in the EU, they are not alone. I would blame more on other member states on not going public with alternative plans. For example no member state has suggested that banking and finance should be made a European competence, that member states should surrender their authority over banking sector the EU in exchange for the European institutions taking care and dealing with banking crises.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"The EU will be very much a federation by that time. The UK will also be part of it, because when it comes down to it happening, they will justify it to their population by saying ""We can't have those europeans screwing around trying to marginalize us"", so they'll ""reluctantly"" join with a clause that allows them to leave any time they want but will never use it other than threatening to use it (just like Texas in the US, and up to a point Quebec in Canada [ya hear, that brits? you're acting like the french */trollface/*).

British English will be the primary language that everyone is expected to know other than the national languages. This is actually something that the UK has contributed to the EU, so they do have quite a big influence in things.. they just forget about it sometimes :)

Each region/country will be respected for different reasons, like for example ""Southern Europe"" will be where the serious food growing happens, because you can't exactly grow nice oranges in the UK in big quantities whenever you want. Germany, France and the UK will be the manufacturing powerhouses and will probably co-operate much more between them. Each country/region has things that they are good at doing, and if there is coordination so that everyone focuses on what they are best at, we'll have a bit of everything done right.

The external borders will probably be locked down, making it hard for people to just pop in without going through a checkpoint, with several programs to allow asylum seekers to come in if they follow a certain legal procedure and are eligible for it.

While the EU federation will have one of the largest professional military forces on the planet, it will primarily be a defensive force (kinda like Germany's forces are today) as the europeans want to feel safe, but they do not really want to go bomb other countries. The majority of the forces will probably be stationed around the borders.

The identities of each country/region will be kept, so that people growing up in lets say Spain will still be ""Spanish Europeans"" and learn about their past etc etc.. In reality life won't change for the average european compared to what it is today, other than belonging to a bigger entity.. so for example: if a new service is available online, they will no longer only be available for the 2-3 biggest countries in Europe, but the entire EU, so things such as the ""single market"" will be enforced, which in the case of buying things on the internet could come as part of flat fees EU-wide for posting stuff in the mail.

It's entirely possible that it will be split into regions and given funky-weird-stupid-retarded names, like for example the scandinavian countries will be ""Scandia"" or some shit like that. So lets say about 5-6 different regions that elect their own regional government, who is then accountable to a smaller EU-wide central government that coordinates the regional governments. They'd probably try to make each region based on their total population so that each region has approximately the same population and an equal vote, so no region will be more important than another and results will be based on majority.

However, when you look at the way eurovision has changed over the years, it's also possible that they will split the countries into 5-6 different groups and then just shuffle them randomly and make random countries work with eachother under a federal government.

I think I can agree with you that we shouldn't be asking today for money of the whole of the EU. First a plan with the Eurozone, then when the future of Greece is more certain we could get a plan with all of the EU.

Greece as it is today is indeed a real mess and on the short term it won't get any better either, especially if we abandon them. But letting it collapse is a even a worse solution than helping it on the short term. You live with the idea that the Greeks will be very complacent and just start rebuilding their country into the strongest nation of Europe. I don't believe that. I think things will get *really* messed up. Manifestations, riots, suicides, radicalisation.

And not whole of the economic world is behind the fall of the Eurozone. I study economic sciences in Ghent and most of the professors here think we should save the euro today, because the cost of letting it fall will be too big. The forming of the eurozone was indeed premature and choosing to save it now would indeed be a bad choice. But letting it fall would be worse.

La settimana scorsa sono andato a fare la spesa all'ipermercato IperCoop.
Terminati gli acquisti, quando sono andato al parcheggio per caricare la spesa nell'auto, sono stato avvicinato da 2 ragazze molto appariscenti (probabilmente russe o dell'est) vestite succintamente, nonostante il freddo cane, erano minigonna e top molto scollato.
Una bionda ed una mora, veramente molto carine e provocanti.
Le due truffatrici si avvicinano offrendo di lavare il parabrezza dell'auto e ovviamente lo fanno in modo sensuale e provocante, poggiando i seni sul vetro e cose simili.
Quando offrite loro una mancia rifiutano e chiedono invece, il favore essere accompagnate in un altro centro commerciale.
Se accettate si siedono dietro e mentre guidate iniziano a giocare tra loro toccandosi e baciandosi dappertutto.
Questo ovviamente vi distrae dalla guida.
All'improvviso la mora passa sul sedile del passeggero ed inizia a toccarvi.
Se non la respingete inizia a praticarvi una fellatio.
Poiché è impossibile guidare in tale situazione, vi fermate in un posto un po' appartato...
A quel punto, sempre la mora vi sale sopra e, prendendo l'iniziativa, vi coinvolge in rapporto sessuale completo.
Approfittando della vostra distrazione la bionda scende dalla macchina, apre il portabagagli, vi ruba tutta la spesa e scappa.
Voi ve ne accorgete, interrompete il rapporto, scendete dall'auto, vi ricomponete sommariamente e cercate d'inseguirla; così anche la mora scappa in direzione opposta.
Sono molto brave e pericolose.
Io stesso sono caduto in trappola.
Lunedì mattina m'hanno rubato una cassetta di Ferrarelle,
lunedì sera un litro d'olio d'oliva.
Martedì un pacco di biscotti.
Mercoledì uno spazzolino da denti.
Giovedì mattina sei uova e la sera un pacchetto di fazzolettini di carta.
Venerdì all'ora di pranzo una scatoletta di tonno e nel pomeriggio un ovetto Kinder.
Sabato in tarda mattinata un pettine, dopo pranzo un tubetto di maionese e la sera una scatoletta di Ciappi.
Suggerisco molta cautela!!!

I personally don't mind the decisions made at the EU level so far as they cover most of my beliefs on average anyway. We can't always have our own way on something, and our way is not always the best.

Even the UK government makes some very bad decisions that don't respect the wishes of the population. At least at an EU level, we can all collectively flip tables if someone at the EU is trying to pass something we don't want (see for example ACTA). When it comes down to it, we all generally have the same expectations -- this is why we're European.

If they made it a little bit more democratic (which a federal-type system more than likely will be), I don't see how this would be undemocratic or how anybody would lose their country.

Surely everyone who was unemployed my age (few years out of college) saw the need for change, but everyone that graduated with me (was republican) and had a nice job didn't challenge their views just because of others who were now unemployed. I never did understand why they thought that way though.

Maybe it's because the group of friends i have is young, and therefore don't use as much healthcare. Everyone i asked who was older seemed to understand that it was an issue, but most already saw that the system needed change to begin with (aka democrats).

You and I can speculate all day on the possibility that, if the US were to wane in power, the EU might pull together and take a greater role on the world stage.

That's fine. That's an interesting discussion. It's *relevant*.

However, that kind of discussion is **not** what I am complaining about. If you read the first few posts, you'll see a very interesting argument that the US might move towards some kind of a monarchy type of situation. That's it. No

The British would be one of the first to support such a move. ... the only logical step for all of us (including the americans) is for the europeans (being american allies) to step up and help them maintain our little western reality bubble.

*That* is what I object to. The guy clearly doesn't give a toss about where the EU will be in 50 years, but he would very much like to discuss America *instead*. This *instead* is where I find fault. It's happened in this thread, it's happened all over the subreddit. If I want to exclusively discuss America and the problems it faces, I can do so in r/politics, or r/askreddit, or r/explainlikeI'mfive, or r/worldnews, or r/pics, or r/technology, or hundreds of others. Must that topic of discussion disrupt our talking about the EU here as well?

I think they would have, not doing so wouldn't have made any sense from their perspective. As I've already said, this doesn't mean the tax cuts are off the table, it just means that they'll have to renegotiate to reconcile the positions of the upper- with that of the lower house. The adjustment of the lower tax bracket has to happen anyway, there's nothing to lose here. They could win by negotiating an increase of some other tax, preferably on high incomes, and use that money for education, research or infrastructure. It makes strategic sense, is in line with their general policies, and these days overall net tax cuts aren't popular in Germany anyway.

I'm a ""conservative folk"" and I certainly do know what socialism is and how it differs from communism. I'm against the government involvement in healthcare for the same reason I'm against government involvement in all services: I want as many people as possible to have the highest quality healthcare at the cheapest cost. This doesn't happen when a government dispenses services. Obamacare is not socialism, however, since it does something far more nefarious: it forces insurance companies to cover people.

Despite the lies the administration barked during the ""debate,"" as anyone who has gone through Macroeconomics 101 knows, the number of buyers is a determinant of demand; that is, if the number of consumers of a product or service increases, it will shift the demand curve up, resulting in a higher equilibrium price. This is what will happen once the 30 million or so are insured.

Obamacare will destroy not only our healthcare system, but also our financial solvency. It will prove to be the last straw that broke the camel's back.

I oppose it on economic grounds. There is, however, a compelling moral argument to be made, namely that I should not be forced to pay for your medical care. Why should I be forced to cover the chemotherapy for someone who's smoked for 50 years? If I take care of my own body by exercising and eating right and making good decisions, why should I have to pay into a system that treats people who have made poor decisions? It should be the other way around.

Of course, the liberals will tell you that ""we all bear the burden when one person is sick."" This is malarkey. I only bear the burden if I am forced to by the government, such as their ridiculous mandate that emergency rooms aren't allowed to turn anyone away, including illegal immigrants. The only people who ""bear the burden"" are those who come into contact with a sick person, which is her family &amp; friends and her employer. These are the people who have any investment into the health of a sick person- this is why companies provide health insurance, because they need healthy workers!

This does not and never will work with healthcare for many reasons.

Healthcare is very different from other products in the free market, because it also depends on the ""buyer"" as an individual.

If a car company wants to sell a car they don't care if the buyer is a student or a 70 year old grandma. They just try to create a car that does good against it competitors and sell if for a good price.

Another point are preexisting conditions, which insurance company would do such a stupid business decision and cover such people if the government doesn't force them to do so? 

Also it works over much longer terms. If you buy a car that's just one moment and that's it. Maybe you can get a bit better service if you are a loyal customer, but that's it. But if we talk about healthcare it usually works that way that many young people pay into the system but don't need the care, but care for the older people and the same will happen once they reach this age. But how is a private market going to deal with this when a 50 year old suddenly decides to get healthcare who hasn't payed into the system and usually doesn't have 50000, 100000 or more in savings to make up for the payment he would have had to pay in the past. 

&gt; Of course, the liberals will tell you that ""we all bear the burden when one person is sick."" This is malarkey. I only bear the burden if I am forced to by the government, such as their ridiculous mandate that emergency rooms aren't allowed to turn anyone away, including illegal immigrants.

Unless the EU suddenly gets very creative, the only way out of the euro would be to leave the EU altogether. This can't be forced, either, but the contracts include a clause for doing so voluntarily.  
However, the way the situation is right now, Greece would be left with no other choice if the EU/ECB/IMF Troika decided to withhold bailout payments. It would happen quasi-automatically, and it would happen very quickly.  

Greece's immediate financial problem is that it has a primary deficit. ""Primary deficit"" means that even without the cost of servicing debt, government expenses are still higher than income. They've been cut off from financial markets for about two years now, and are entirely reliant on the bailout funds to cover their deficit. Since their default, they don't actually owe much to the private sector anymore, most of their debt by now is to the EU, ECB and IMF -- i.e., the very institutions they rely on to cover their deficit. Defaulting on this debt as you suggest, mere weeks after already having had the largest default in history, would therefore not be the smartest of moves.

So, *if* the Troika stopped paying, what would happen next? The Greek government would have no way to finance its deficit, and simply wouldn't have the euros to make all ongoing payments in full -- government contractors, public employees, unemployment benefits, welfare checks and pensions. It would be like having to balance the budget literally over night, austerity on steroids with absolutely no time to adjust.  
It would turn into a vicious cycle of falling revenue from a shrinking economy, but at this point, we'd be in self-fulfilling prophecy territory, with bank runs and capital flight to avoid devaluation.

I can't see how your morality, which allows you to value the lives of human beings based on their relative locality to yourself is any more appreciable.

You're honestly arguing that if you took the govt revenue spent on welfare/healthcare etc, even a certain percentage sum would not make huge strides to saving many more lives elsewhere? Of course it would. But we don't. In fact, I'd argue that in relative terms most people in the 'developed' nations live highly decadent lives. The levels of charity that exist quantify the level of compassion we as a society *actually* feel for others. That's just who we are. Authorizing government coercion to redistribute resources within a locality is the ultimate moral laziness I can imagine. It allows you to escape your own moral obligations. I'm not saying there should be no compassion, of course there should. But it should be voluntary and one should take personal responsibility.

There is no intrinsic 'right to a job' - your work and productivity are judged by the marketplace - why should someone be rewarded for generating no value? If enough workers choose to demand higher pay and everyone strikes, of course industry will respond through negotating higher wages. It's common sense - your role is valued by the skill level you bring, the productive output you have and (most importantly) your next best alternative in the market. I don't even understand how this is relevant to the conversation. The role of government is first and foremost the defence of its civilians from force, upholding laws of fraud, private property and possible necessary infrastructure. It is should NOT be a moral authority.

Oh, and this generation of 'people who fought' are long gone. The remnants are those that take advantage of the rhetoric to further their interests. If you honestly believe everything your politicians say then please feel free to inform me of what it is that you are smoking.

I never argued against 'improving the situation'. The best improvement is to allow people to trade and work for their gain and let them exercise their own morality.

You have absolutely no evidence for this, but I *do* have evidence for the fact that if we support them, we do support corruption and their early retirenment. Your argument is not valid, scientifically - sorry.

Most of the economics professors in Sweden, UK and the US are saying godbye to Greece. Does *anyone* of your professors defend Greece, financially. Your professors are biased. I can give you professors in Sweden that says differently. Do you have any professors that defends the fact that you take EU money for the Eurozone? How do you defend that?  

But you haven't answered this- you are using Swedens money, for your failed currency. How can you look yourself in the mirror - how can you be so corrupt. Why? Please, answer that. You might save your currency, but you have failed as countries and as humans if you have used money you are not allowed to in the process. That alone disqualifies the Euro, it is undemocratic and corrupt.Answer this.

But, with independence of who was right (I would say no-one was), nobody should expect now an ""OK, we were wrong"" from any part involved: neither the Greeks are going to accept crippling austerity that would enslave their economy for generations, nor Germany is going to keep the money flowing without measures being applied.

So, if the anti-bailout parties win the new election as it seems likely, I can only see two plausible developments: Either Syriza is able to present a plan to EU to guarantee the growth and future payment of the debt and that is solid enough for lenders to be able to accept it without committing political suicide to their own advertising, or Greece leaves the Euro and we cross our fingers for their future and ours.",0,1336855882,null,0,false,0,c4na1t7,t3_tjzjd,t1_c4na1t7,t1_c4n9g91,null,1428911849,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

This is by no means a perfect transcription but it allows you to get the gist of the text.  It's basically a receipt for the courier of the king who took some letters from Tours to Lyons and back. It starts off with standard legal jargon: in the presence of me, councillor and secretary of the king. Olivier Guerre, *chevaucheur ordinaire* of the king's stables, confesses to having been paid the sum of 400 livres for his voyage (done in diligence and on postal horses) from Tours to Lyon. For his return, he also received a sum of 400 livres. Guerre has been paid cashmoneys (*receue contant* 'received in cash') and is quite pleased with the outcome (*s'est tenu contant*) and this is all very legal and witnessed. Dated and signed 5th September 1620.

A couple more things... The top line was certainly added at a later date.  Note the different (more modern) spelling of *roi* 'king' and the date in Arabic numerals. And apparently a *chevaucher* was 'in the past, a royal messenger who would bring letters by horse and could requisition fresh horses'.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yeah, about 90% of people in Paraguay speak Guarani. Only around 70% speak Spanish. As far as I know it's not common for people in the upper classes (read: white people) to speak native languages in Bolivia. Also, it's much more fractionalized, they speak many of their native languages, while in Paraguay we settled for the one that was most commonly spoken before the Spanish came. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Bolivia#Demographics)'s a breakdown of languages people speak in Bolivia (but it's wikipedia, don't trust it too much). The wiki on Paraguay is wrong, but according to the results for the latest census ([2002](http://www.dgeec.gov.py/Publicaciones/Biblioteca/Web%20Paraguay%20Total%20Pais/Paraguaytotalpais.htm)) about 80% spoke Guarani and about 60% spoke Spanish.

I don't know much about the rest, but I know a significant number of people still speak Quechua in Peru and maybe Ecuador, and plenty of people still speak the various Mayan languages around Guatemala. Mexicans still make a big deal about Nahuatl, but I doubt very many of them can actually say much in Nahuatl besides ""Mexico"" and ""chocolate"".

Native languages are practically dead in most other Latin American countries. I know in Argentina they waged an extensive war against the natives much like they did in North America, and as is predictable, the natives were almost wiped out. I believe something similar happened in most other countries.

I think it's notable that the poorest countries are the ones that best kept their native languages. Except in places were intermixing happened very early on, such as Paraguay, I would imagine the cities remained largely centered around Spanish, and so urbanization and economic growth killed the native languages. Even in Paraguay there is a pretty clear divide between urban and rural areas. Within the cities my first instinct is always to address people in Spanish, while in the countryside I always try Guarani first. While we are technically all taught both languages in high school, our education is so poor that I doubt we'll be able to keep it up just through that, and I unfortunately predict as the country grows and becomes more urban fewer people will speak the native language.",0,1336861964,null,0,false,0,c4nb1lz,t3_tjghs,t1_c4nb1lz,t1_c4nan6m,null,1428912323,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

You're also complaining about content being on different subreddit, not two days ago did you cross post this [picture](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Heidelberg_corr.jpg) to different subreddits. How do you think the people subscribed to both those subreddits felt? Did you stop to think about how you might be ruining their Reddit experience?

Notice how for number 4 you wrote ""es geht IHM gut""... is ihm accusative or dative?  Then, reevaluate your answer in number 3.

If I were to translate number 6 into english, it would be something like ""I'm requesting you all him an Answer"".  All of the problems that are in my english translation here are present in what you wrote in german.

You are conjugating ""ihr"" as if it were ""Sie"" or ""Wir""

I would add a pronoun to to 12, ie ""We don't doubt IT"", as opposed to ""We don't doubt.""

We have the most expensive healthcare in the world.  Much of this is due to health insurance and the government masking the actual costs.  Private citizens pay a small fee when they see a doctor, plus a small amount of the total bill if they have insurance or are covered by the government.  The insurance or government pays the rest.  This is paid for by monthly health insurance premiums, which for those who are employed, are largely paid by the employer, and by taxes to the government.

As a result, individuals never have to pay the full cost of their healthcare, unless they are both unemployed and not covered by a government plan.  Those in this category were about 10% of the population (these people are still mostly not covered).

There are a few problems with the health plan implemented:

1) The individual mandate, as implemented, is the government requiring that all adults purchase a product, with a fine if they do not.  This part of the law is unconstitutional, whether the Supreme Court will agree remains to be seen.

2) Because it is a mixed private/public plan, health care costs do not change.  This means that government-funded care is going to be horrendously expensive.  This might be acceptable if we were not already borrowing a third to 40% of our budget.

3) The costs for employers to provide health plans are significantly higher.  Some employers have already said they will phase out offering health coverage to employees, as it is cheaper to pay the penalties.

4) The Cadillac Health Plan penalty will result it reduced coverage for a lot of workers.  This penalty is a 40% tax on health plans offered by employers with a value above a certain dollar amount, which is indexed to inflation.  Health care costs in the US go up much faster than the government-reported rate of general inflation.  As a result, by 2016, 40% of health plans provided by employers will fall above the penalty line.  Employers will reduce coverage to stay under the threshold.

You are claiming all these unrealistic scenarios, that isn't happening (nor have they ever happened) and on that dream scenario basis, you want to save the Euro, and Sweden to contribute (in an ideal world, where Sweden democratically vote for giving billions to Greece). But that is not what is happening. The Eurozone has no plan and they are already asking for more money. That means, that the scenario you as a person wants and hopes for, isn't happening. It is like when you say that you want to stop the corruption in Greece, by carefully monitoring them. Seriously, that is very, very naive. At this very second, Belgium's money is paying for a 61 year olds pension and that 61 year old is cheating on his taxes.  

In other words, the scenarios you are describing isn't happening, nor do they seem to. So you want to save the Euro, based on dream scenarios that, we can say for sure do not exist. 

You have to deal with the world that exist - today. Today, the Eurozone is supporting massive corruption. Today, the Eurozone is taking EU money to save their currency. Today, the non Eurozone countries are paying for the Eurozones mistakes. 

That alone disqualifies the Eurozone..

France was seen as a model, and the french language as a source for re-latinization.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_awakening_of_Romania

&gt;In the Romantic era, the concept of a national state emerged among the Romanians, as among many other peoples of Europe and a national awakening began. Defining themselves against the nearby Slavs, Germans, and Hungarians, the nationalist Romanians looked for models of nationality in the other Latin countries, notably France.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language#French_and_Italian_words

&gt;Since the 19th century, many modern words were borrowed from the other Romance languages, especially from French and Italian (for example: birou ""desk, office"", avion ""airplane"", exploata ""exploit""). It was estimated that about 38% of the number of words in Romanian are of French and/or Italian origin (in many cases both languages); and adding this to the words that were inherited from Latin, about 75%-85% of Romanian words can be traced to Latin. The use of these Romanianized French and Italian loanwords has tended to increase at the expense of Slavic loanwords, many of which have become rare or fallen out of use. As second or third languages, French and Italian themselves are better known in Romania than in Romania's neighbors. Along with the switch to the Latin alphabet in Moldova, the re-latinization of the vocabulary has tended to reinforce the Latin character of the language.

Knowledge in French as a Foreign language is higher than you would expect:

See map: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Knowledge_of_French_EU_map.svg

Also, the political system has a strong French influence. We have a semi-presidential system, while the only other EU member to have one is France, afaik.

PS. French architecture was extremely influential on late 19th c. BUcharest:

&gt;In 1862, after Wallachia and Moldavia were united to form the Principality of Romania, Bucharest became the new nation's capital; in 1881, it became the political centre of the newly-proclaimed Kingdom of Romania under Carol I. During the second half of the 19th century, due to its new status, the city's population increased dramatically, and a new period of urban development began. During this period, gas lighting, horse-drawn trams and limited electrification were introduced. The Dâmboviţa was also chanelled in 1883, thus putting a stop tgo previously endemic floods. The extravagant architecture and cosmopolitan high culture of this period won Bucharest the nickname of ""The Paris of the East"" (or ""Little Paris"", Micul Paris), with Calea Victoriei as its Champs-Élysées.",0,1336896545,null,0,false,0,c4ng70b,t3_tjghs,t1_c4ng70b,t1_c4nanpd,null,1428914744,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I want the Eurozone to survive, but I don't want corruption to become more rampant. If the Eurozone saves itself by extorting other nations, than I'm not behind it. If the Eurozone money ends up in the pocket of politicians, than I'm not behind it. If I vote for a politician, I'm also not behind everything that politician says or does.


That is the problem of the today, right there. You are only on board with the ""good"" decisions, so no one can call you out. 

Sorry, no way I am falling for that.You can't just cherrypick to be responsible for the good things and ignore everything else, or want to change it with unrealistic dream scenarios,while at the same time the Eurozone is bullying and supporting corruption. No way you can exclude yourself from that.  

If I vote for someone, I am responsible for that. You as a pro-Euro person is responsible for the bullying, the corruption the whole bits.


&gt;But the scenario I'm defending isn't impossible. It might not be happening today, 

True, but since you are just arguing based on dream scenarios you are not dealing what is here today, and that is harmful. For example, you want the Eurozone to continue to support the Greeks,based on (among other things) the ""fact"" that they might change. Fine, do that, but then you are ignoring the fact that your money, at this very moment, is going towards corruption. . Sure, you say it's bad, but you are not doing anything to stop it, since you are not responsible for the bad things and dream about the good things. The Eurozone is supporting corruption - that needs to stop today.


Dream all you want, that is a good thing, but deal with reality. Do not claim money based on dream scenarios, which is essentially what you and the Eurozone is doing. 


&gt;But that intuition also says that letting a monetary zone collapse without any form of exit plan will go without any problems

That is very different from saving the Euro and most certainly from thinking Greece should stay within. I don't think I've ever said that they shouldn't have an exit plan, although this  is fairly unprecedented, so I don't really know actually if there's is one. I agree though, it would cause problems, massive ones. I think the Eurozone is causing that too, at the moment, so maybe this is better. 

Btw, I think the Euro could survive, maybe, but then one has to drop a few countries, like Greece for example. And change a lot of things. 


&gt;How do you mean, not really? 

It was in a respond to what you said that no one could predict what is happening/the crises. What I meant was that some of the biggest arguments for the ""Vote no to the Euro -campaign"" in Sweden was that:


* The economies within the Euro are to different, and (essentially) Germany will control the interest rate. That is going to lead to huge problems, since the different countries are not going to be able to use their own currency/their interest rate to help them in time of financial turomoil. That is also one of the problems within the EZ that we see today. 

* Stupid to have financial integration without political

* The stronger economies will have to support the weaker within the EZ system. 

* Stupid to give away independence to countries who essentially do not care about your problems, they (rather understandably) care about their own, therefore not listening. 


I think we can see that they were right. No, they were not that smart, more common sense, or maybe you call it intuition.

Well, that's a point on which we disagree then. Why can't I have my *own* view? I'm only responsible for my own views and I only need to defend those. You can blame me for lack of realism, but I already countered that. I said there is some idealism in my view, but that that isn't necessairily wrong. I want the Eurozone to keep existing, but via fair measurements. If they only can keep existing by extorting other nations undemocratically, then I'm not behind it.

It's the same things as if we were to discuss the US invasion of Iraq, and I said that I really support the invasion - but not the killing. Obviously you'd go ""What, you can't say that, you can't have military invasions without killings?"".

There seem to be three different claims/arguments: 1) (the point I went on about in my initial post) Germany has no moral high ground, since it is just as much in violation of the treaty as Greece, Italy, etc. 2) (the point you mention) It would in fact be better, economically, for everyone, if Germany would leave the Eurozone, and 3) (the point you mention in your last paragraph, but that I can only read between the lines in the article itself) There is more at stake than just economic considerations.

My answers to each point would be, a bit short perhaps, but to get the basic idea across: 1) Nobody should have a moral high ground, but the situations in  the core Eurozone *is* substantially different from that of the periphery, and the simple statement ""they're all in violation of the treaty"" isn't going to cut it; 2) If Germany left the Eurozone, apart from any other considerations, would almost guarantee the debt owed to Germany would never be paid back in a real sense: the debt is held in Euro, which would devalue drastically compared to a new D.Mark, which would essentially mean the debt isn't paid back (you can of course argue that you would want that to happen, but that needs some additional arguments); 3) which is the only point I can respect: not only economic decisions should guide is in the crisis, also social ones.

&gt;Der Beginn des Naturismus in der DDR lag in den frühen 1950er Jahren in Ahrenshoop. (...)Die Region war ein Badeort der gesellschaftlichen Avantgarde der DDR, ein Urlaubsort für zahlreiche Schriftsteller, Schauspieler und Politiker. Es kam in den folgenden Jahren zu Konflikten zwischen bekleideten und unbekleideten Badegästen, bis die Gemeindeverwaltung Ahrenshoop im Mai 1954 das Nacktbaden verbot. Aus dieser Zeit stammt auch die später bekanntgewordene Anekdote, wonach der Kulturminister Johannes R. Becher eine nacktbadende Frau mit den Worten: „Schämen Sie sich nicht, Sie alte Sau?“ anschrie. Es handelte sich dabei um Anna Seghers, die er nicht erkannt hatte.

They were very popular with young kids because they're so sweet you can't taste the alcohol, and off-brand knock-offs came dirt cheap. They put a lid on it by taxing them to hell.) I was in uni at the time and researching this for a social psych project, and the statistics regarding underage teens in hospitals with alcohol poisoning didn't look all that great.

That said, I do agree the culture as a whole treats alcohol much differently. When a German hears ""beer"", they don't think of teenagers getting wasted or people speed drinking at the pub to get a few more in before last call. I like how it's just a part of culture, rather than this schizophrenic thing that's at the same time vilified and used in excess.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism#Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism#Germany)

&gt;German naturism was part of the Lebensreform movement and the Wandervogel youth movement of 1896, from Steglitz, Berlin which promoted ideas of fitness and vigour. At the same time doctors of the Natural Healing Movement were using heliotherapy, treating diseases such as TB, rheumatism and scrofula with exposure to sunlight.


&gt;The Nacktkultur refers to a network of over 200 private clubs in Germany which promote nudism as a way of connect the individual to nature. It was coined in 1902 by Heinrich Pudor and published as a 3 volume treatise in 1906 connecting nudism, vegetarianism and social reform. However, its roots might go back as far as the 1870s. Its major promoters were Adolf Koch and Hans Suren. Germany published the first journal of nudism between 1902 and 1932.",0,1336919238,null,0,false,0,c4nhzsj,t3_tkt5r,t1_c4nhzsj,t3_tkt5r,null,1428915667,-4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-4

However, even if they did manage these reforms, they would not have solved any major part of the problem. I'm talking about the problems that drive (foreign or local) investment away like red tape, corruption, taxation etc have not been tackled. 

Also, it is not wise to try and push reforms at the very last moment and after foreign pressure. That process looks forced by somebody else and obviously people will react to that. There have been governments in the past that were popular enough to gradually change things for the better, but instead they they only cared about the next election and actually put the country in deeper debt.

But I do not disagree with you, yes reforms are unpopular (nobody likes to change their habits). And that is why I am saying that we need a leader, someone who would be inspirational and who will be able to communicate with the masses and explain that the reforms are for long term prosperity. We don't have such a leader. On the bright side, almost no country has such a leader any more.

I will never say that the people are totally not to blame, just that the politicians should get the majority of the blame. After all, their job is supposedly that.

true,Duckylicious,null,null,"Yeah - not only is legal age to drink so low that anyone who's not an actual teenager is unlikely to get carded, but they also tend to just not give a fuck (whether or not this is a good thing is up for debate). Though admittedly, the fact that I still get carded in the UK (I'm 29) is enjoyably flattering ;)

Regarding the differences in pubs, the first one that comes to my mind is that I quite enjoy having table service. Being able to just sit and chat with your friends and occasionally wave at the waiter/waitress to get another drink is so much more enjoyable. I find it quite disruptive when people have to keep getting up to go to the bar to get more drinks, and it's closely related to the constant pressure to buy in rounds (which makes you feel guilty if you leave after a drink or two, before it's been your turn, and tends to encourage overly speedy drinking). 

I hadn't really noticed the police vans so much as the bouncers. The only places you have visible bouncers in Germany are fancy-shmancy clubs that pretend they're special by turning away people at the door based on looks (think P1 in Munich). I've never been to one myself. In the UK, there's bouncers everywhere. In Ireland, you even see them at McDonald's and supermarkets (and one time I found out why when a guy started throwing dishes at the barman in a pub at around 7:30 pm). 

To get back on topic and respond to your last paragraph - I tend to agree. We have what lots of Americans would call a ""nanny government"" because of mandatory healthcare, piles of regulations for starting up your own company, tight regulations on building and whatnot (and the fact you have to go register at city hall whenever you move somewhere) - but we still place more trust in the individual. And yes, the Nazi thing gets old at times.

I find the East German vs. West German thing mentioned in the article interesting as well, it's a pity it was only superficially mentioned rather than discussed in depth. I grew up in West Germany, and my mom was a homemaker, as were most of my friends'. My colleagues are from former East Germany, and to them the notion of a woman just staying home for years and years was completely unthinkable. The East was way ahead in terms of offering daycare as well. It'd be interesting to research properly how these differences still affect Germans today.

true,Jerrycar,null,null,"Federalism only works if there is some form of shared cultural history or some sense of identity to cling on to. It barely works in the UK or Spain. The system has pretty much also almost broken down in Belgium which relies on a hugely complicated beurocracy to keep Flemish, French and German speakers together.  It has failed in numerous states before with horrifying consequences. Why do you think that it would work in Europe? We don't even have a common language. 

Militarily we can't be properly integrated as nation states have hugely divergent national interests - look at Libya, Algeria or the Balklands conflicts for recent examples. 

Economically federalism is neigh on impossible unless the richer countries accept huge wealth transfers to other countries that they feel at best no affinity with and at worse hostile to. 

Legally there are two different legal systems at work in the EU - the UK one which generally goes out of its way to protect the individual and a Euro one which takes a more societal view. Just look to inheritance laws for the difference. In the UK you can leave your money to whom you like, in Italy and France there are regularly legal battles as to who deserves the money - children or the mistress for example. The UK is already becoming hostile to the European Court which it feels makes up case law as it goes along by the spirit rather than the letter of the law. 

Culturally Europe is probably divided most accurately into North/South with a further sub-divided between those who want free-trade, free-movement of peoples, goods, capital and services and those who want federalism. There are also huge business practice differences and cultural attitudes to the states and government between countries. Those Cultural difference are easy to spot if you move from Denmark to southern Italy or Croatia. Even the extent to which people obey the law, and the laws they obey are different in different juristictions. If I go for a meeting in a Spanish office someone will invariably offer me an ashtray for example (I think it's technically illegal!)

I didn't even notice the thing about the bouncers but yeah that is exactly right!

I guess the difference is also maybe due to the more community based and less individual nature of the East, so raising the children was seen as the duty of the community, and not solely the mother. Women in the USSR also had more independence IIRC.

It seems that nowadays a single-income family just isn't an economic possibility for most people (speaking for the UK at least - hell I know a lot of young people who are both working and still choose not to have children for fear of the expense) due to rising living costs and stagnant wages, as the rise of dual-incomes just makes it so that everyone has to do so to keep up. Also as childcare provision is often left to the individual and can be very expensive thus leading to more pressure on grandparents etc. so perhaps the system of the East was quite a good idea.

Also as a native German - do you think that the differences between East and West persist even now? I mean I see some people complain that the rapid privatisation of the East and that it wasn't as developed in the first place caused it to suffer economically post-reunification, but is it pretty much the same now?

I don't think we could keep our current flat and standard of living on one salary, not even close, never mind saving for the down payment on our own place or putting money aside for retirement. We're both expats with no family here in the UK, so grandparents aren't really an option. 

Regarding your last question, I'm not sure I'm qualified to answer as I've had very little experience with former east Germany, but as a general assessment I'd say you won't see much difference in the places now (the dilapidated areas of East Germany have been done up etc.), but that in and of itself has generated some rifts and resentment. West Germans grumble about paying ""solidarity tax"", East Germans grumble about high unemployment rates (both the extreme left and extreme right wing parties tend to find their supporters there), abandoned 'Plattenbau' marring the landscape, and West Germans still treating them as second class citizens (which by and large isn't true). 

I do know that when I was looking at universities, some of the ones in East Germany were highly recommended (such as Jena) because they're pretty top of the line now, but with lower associated living costs than in the West.",0,1336926220,null,0,false,0,c4nj3j6,t3_tkrnp,t1_c4nj3j6,t1_c4niof6,null,1428916179,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

I went to a school that was nearly 700 years old, a university that is 170 years old and I live in a house that is 150 years old and probably as a result of that weight of history, my upbringing and the geographical isolation of Britain from other European countries I feel British. I literally have no affinity with other Europeans, no sense of solidarity. They are foreign even if I am staying with my German or French or Montenegrin etc etc friends. A sense of national pride, of belonging to a community is very important. People inevitably act in their self interest and for the interests of those whom they feel closely affiliated with like family or friends. It should be no suprise that people also act in the interest of their nation - its a loose societal grouping but creates a common solidarity that quite simply cannot be artifically imposed by the someone dictating federalism. 

European countries often have long colonial histories and therefore they can have interets or they can share solidarity or they can keep a more active interest in events than other nations in some of the most peculiar spots of the world. Give you a trade example, the EU banned the UK had common interest with the Windward Islands which meant that we pretty much exclusively importanted our bananas from them until the EU banned the practice as they were a colony until 1960. 53% of Algerian imports and exports head to the EU but the vast majority of that is just to France and Italy due to their geographical proximity and historical ties. 

If you want military examples of divergent interest then just look at any conflict in the past 50 years with the exception of the Kosovo war (that was fought under a NATO banner) which a European state was involved in. 
Iraq was vetoed in the UN by France, the Libya conflict faced huge opposition from Italy. You can surely only really act as a super power if you have a similar interests. Some states in Europe have a history of military intervention, others are legally neutral. Besides if there was a European superpower only the French and British, and possibly Spanish actually have the military strenght and requisite men, equipment and military spending (as a proportion of GDP - don't worry Scandinavians) to do anything. 

Even the single currency is being smashed apart by natioanal interests - look at the German bailouts of Greece the Germans are arguing that why should they bail out the Greeks considering that they don't have any national solidarity. Can you imagine London telling the North of England that they aren't going to help finance their government spending or New Jersey ending its federal subsidy to the rest of America because they don't feel solidarity with New York? 

Beyond an airy-fairy attatchment to quasi-free trade and a system that reportedly is in favour of democracy there is none. Europe is not unified and I doubt it will ever be. Its not that Europe doesn't get along its more an answer to the question - Would you feel comfortable if another nation or group of nations could dictate your laws?

The other thing, and this is really important for FDP followers is that the state FDP in both states distance themselfs from the federal FDP and Rösler.

For the average citizen the reunification was a huge boon. If we had to 'go our own way' instead we would probably be on the level of the Czech Republic now. If you compare that to the reality, people really shouldn't complain.

Problem is, for many people status is more important than money and the social hierarchy was in a lot of places completely reshuffled.
So people who were previously in high status positions and now are just 'normal' people obviously lament this. (I don't just mean party officials here, even just farmers were sucked up to, because some foodstuffs were hard to get.)

Another problem was, that most people had no experience with 'capitalism' and many people have stories of falling for conmen in the early 90s or buying stuff too expensively that they now regret. Overall they probably gained much more than they lost, but such experiences do hurt.

Many factories were a lot less productive than their western counterparts and wages were raised dramatically after the reunification to 2/3rds or 3/4ths of the western level. That meant that these factories were not competitive and were closed down and lots people had to find different jobs or became unemployed.
This looked like an economic downturn post reunification.

The East is still poorer than the West on average, but by now the wealthy regions in the East are richer than poorer regions in the West, so instead of transfer payments from West-&gt;East there should be payments from richer regions to poorer regions no matter where they are.

It would seem that eventually, if the UK remains in the EU, [they more than likely will adopt the euro](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17742675).

I'm willing to bet that when it comes down to it and everyone weighs up the pros and cons, the UK will remain in the EU, adopt the euro and join in at the front lines, using their influence to benefit both the UK and the EU instead of shouting ""You are all a bunch of failures"" from the sidelines.

Suppose, on the other hand, that the Europeans are making the right moves in order to save the economy, but perhaps a bit too slowly (because of the way the EU is disorganized.. we can all agree on that -- we all want that fixed, not not necessarily by dismantling everything).. hopefully they start passing some growth packages very soon (especially with Hollande winning in France)...

Suppose the response to the economic crisis that these euroskeptic ""we know better"" people in power are giving manages to drive the British economy into a brick wall with their current policies..

I refuse to believe that, being intelligent people, the British people will remain euroskeptic at that point.

Look at this whole thing with JPMorgan in the states announcing $2 billion losses so early in the quarter. It's very possible that the losses are way higher and are not even limited to just them, but many of the bigger banks (a lot of which operate out of London).

I have no doubts that the british people never forget, but I do believe they can admit when they were wrong without being arrogant about it. Would you not welcome a more pro-european route if you suddenly found out that you've been sold out by the euroskeptics?

We both know we can keep this going back and forth all night. Time, bro.. time will determine what will happen. Lets just agree to disagree for now -- I can't prove you wrong and you can't prove me wrong either. The UK joining the eurozone is still a possibility if the EU gets their act together and fixes the problems behind it. All I know is that everything would have been much more solid and smooth if the UK was behind the euro from the very beginning trying to make sure it was done right.

Edit: Just to add something, the losses of JPMorgan are due to some of that awesome financial gambling innovation (gambling with money that doesn't exist while losing real money), techniques which are being used by all of the major banks. The EU has been calling for regulating/punishing these practices for quite some time with the UK being militantly against them doing so..

che poi di solito mi si risponde, ""eh ma allora tua madre è scema e tuo padre è ghei, se loro non si incazzano perchè ti incazzi tu lol trolled over9000"", al che mi tocca spiegare tra una bestemmia e l'altra che i miei genitori non sono onnipotenti e per craftare me c'è voluti nove mesi, altro che sette giorni, quindi se ne parli male magari ci penso io a intercedere per loro, quindi, insomma, stiamo parlando di due scale cosmiche diverse, e inoltre dell'istenza dei miei genitori ho una prova provata, a meno che io stesso non esista o sia stato adottato (non credo, somiglio molto a mia madre fisicamente)(che non è una bella roba da dire a un maschietto di 14 anni ma tutti, in paese, ""oh signur, cum te se come la tu mà"", e quindi boh).

poi ovvio, nella società moderna e civilizzata e l'ambiente di lavoro ove è fatto divieto di bestemmiare non bestemmio, equi mi diranno, ""ecco vedi ipocrita, bestemmi per far bello, ecco, se devi perderci qualcosa non bestemmi, eh! eh! ipocrita!"" e io gli dico, ma scusa, non è che bestemmio per dire che sonomeglio o più bravo, anzi, è una reazione inculcatami dai vecchi che quando ti viene una sfiga tiri una bella madonna, o quando ti girano le balle. In ufficio mi trattengo, ancheperchè mi trattengo anche dall'andare a lavorare in boxer e canotta, e avolte vorrei, ma se invece vado vestito da brava persona nessunomi dice ipocrita. si tratta di obbedire a regole di convivenza civileper cui in determinate situazioni non si bestemmia o non si va vestiti da ""sono a casa da tre giorni da solo e non so cos'è una doccia"".  E poi non è che se non bestemmio allora non credo. rimango comunque ateo a prescindere dal fatto che lo dica, non come i vegetariani che se non ti ricordano ad ogni pasto che sono vegetariano muoiono appassendosi.

e boh, non fumando ho sempre ritenuto he un bel diocane al momento giusto fosse un pò come una sigaretta, è anche una buona analogia dal punto di vista di un credente, cioè, tu sai che fumare fa male e magari vorresti che i tuoi amici smettessero,ma non è che gli stressi l'anima. tanto sai che comunque ci sono luoghi dove è vietato fumare. ecco.

e poi c'è sempre quello che ""EH SI BELLO MA LA BESTEMMIA E REATO AL CODICE CIVILE ARTICOLO SALCAZZO COME BOH!! COME LA METTIAMO?"". lamettiamo che nelle legislature moderne ci sono articoli che andrebbero abrogati e che non vengono più nemmeno filati di striscio, siamo uno stato che fino a vent'anni fa aveva il delitto d'onore perdio, e tu mi vieni a dire che 'è una egge che dice che non devo bestemmiare, ma dai, cazzo, e poi vendim anche che siamo uno stato laico. cerano pure le leggi razziali! e che si fa? ""E MA QUELLE LEGGI SONO VECCHIE MENTRE LA BESTEMMIA EH EHE QUELLA E LEGGE VIGENTE QUINDI TI DENUNZIO"" ma dai santodio che cazzo mi denunci, non pigliamoci per il culo, è il solito discorso da supercattoconservatori che ""quello che diciamo noi è vero e giusto, la vostra vita è sbagliata"". Viviamo in un momento storico in cui la gente da milano torna nel Molise (IL MOLISE, non esiste il molise!), non si arriva a fine mese, disoccupa&lt;ione morte e sterminio e c'è chi protesta perchè c'è l'aborto, chi protesta perchè una donna ha un diritto a scegliere! quindi se io dico porco dio sono uno stronzo e un cane, però se te meni tua moglie e non la fai uscire di casa sei un buon cattolico perchè non ha mai abortito? ma vaffanculpo vah, preferisso il pozzo di fuoco eterno della Gehenna a sto punto che dover mai dire nella mia vita ""sono uno di loro"".

Not the average Brit, for example if we're going on holiday in Europe we tend to say the country or the region unless it's a tour of several European nations. 

 There's a specific type of people in every country who get offended at everything and those people also get offended when you can't identify the UK nations properly.

TBH it's the Scots and the Irish more than anyone else who get hung up  one UK thing, the English view is more of a reaction to that. A prevalent truism in the UK says ""everyone hates the English"" something they have in common with many Englishmen.

England is by far the largest UK nation, the UK is a creation of England, and historically ""England"" also meant the UK even after union, with the rise of nationalism and devolution of power to national governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the people of these nations take offence when others refer to the whole of the UK as England. In England it used to be a bit rare to display the England flag instead of the UK flag until recently.

I don't see why it's amazing that the UK sees itself as a bit different, it was the largest power in it's hay day, developed a superiority complex which now manifests as a strong sense of unique identity. Not long ago Britain used to decide the fates of so many others, now they see the EU as others deciding their fate.",0,1336950684,null,0,true,0,c4nnj9f,t3_tjd3j,t1_c4nnj9f,t1_c4nn6vp,null,1428918269,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,MeteorPhoenix,PUER,Puerto Rico,"&gt; European Countries have different histories, attitudes, cultures, economies and foreign interests. History is ingrained into the fabric of our culture. I went to a school that was nearly 700 years old, a university that is 170 years old and I live in a house that is 150 years old and probably as a result of that weight of history, my upbringing and the geographical isolation of Britain from other European countries I feel British. I literally have no affinity with other Europeans, no sense of solidarity. They are foreign even if I am staying with my German or French or Montenegrin etc etc friends. A sense of national pride, of belonging to a community is very important. People inevitably act in their self interest and for the interests of those whom they feel closely affiliated with like family or friends. It should be no suprise that people also act in the interest of their nation - its a loose societal grouping but creates a common solidarity that quite simply cannot be artifically imposed by the someone dictating federalism.

It's a very interesting claim. You claim that the UK (and not even that; England), a country notoriously eurosceptic, is a good example to gauge how the rest of the countries feel about the whole thing. Do you not think that's a little biased?

Some Scots have little affinity when travelling down to England; does that make them less British? Fierce pride in the local community does not necessarily have to contract a larger one (eg. Scotland is to the UK what the UK is to Europe).

&gt; If you want military examples of divergent interest then just look at any conflict in the past 50 years with the exception of the Kosovo war (that was fought under a NATO banner) which a European state was involved in. Iraq was vetoed in the UN by France, the Libya conflict faced huge opposition from Italy. You can surely only really act as a super power if you have a similar interests. 

And yet it is a process. IIRC, more and more of the different European countries are voting the exact same way at the UN, to give you an example. Look carefully at the wording of my post; I did not claim the EU was a superpower, merely that it was the formation of one. It can still fail, but foreign policy-wise, European interests *tend* to converge.

&gt; Some states in Europe have a history of military intervention, others are legally neutral. Besides if there was a European superpower only the French and British, and possibly Spanish actually have the military strenght and requisite men, equipment and military spending (as a proportion of GDP - don't worry Scandinavians) to do anything.

And that's fine, isn't it? Between French, British, German and Spanish military spending, the EU is only second to the US (far, far higher than the rest of the states in the world).

&gt; Beyond an airy-fairy attatchment to quasi-free trade and a system that reportedly is in favour of democracy there is none. Europe is not unified and I doubt it will ever be.

That's a sweeping generalization. I know plenty of people that feel both European (as an identity) added to their national identity (even some British!). Just because you personally feel nothing towards an European identity does not mean everybody feels as you do.

In regards to democracy, the solution seems quite simple to me: give most powers to the European Parliament (directly elected, therefore democratic), fuse the two Presidencies (from the Council and the Commission) and make it a democratically-elected position. Presto; your democratic deficit is fixed.

I'll note that the UK is against this.

&gt; Its not that Europe doesn't get along its more an answer to the question - Would you feel comfortable if another nation or group of nations could dictate your laws? The answer is generally for the most part a resounding no.

The term ""dictate"" is incorrect, I think. British people vote for European lawmakers. No ""nation"" or ""group of nations"" is dictating anything here. An elected Parliament is legislating.
