That's a really bad question in terms of content and wording.

I suppose it should translate to:  

*How often do you or your family celebrate a WWII holiday?* 

If that's the case it is a very odd question because in Germany there is no real day for this.
Only day that could possibly be meant is the 8th of May. But this day is usually for the victims to mourn their losses.

In the early years after the war Germany didn't really ""celebrated"" this day with regards to the victims.

I think it wasn't until 1985 when Weizsäcker talked about ""Befreiung"" (I think).

The everyday German will probably not celebrate WWII on any special day.

&gt;In Ihres Alltagsleben, wie oft sehen Sie ein Denkmal, das den Zweiten Weltkrieg gewidmet ist?

I'm not sure though this is the case for everyone but I see a memorial (Denkmal or better would be Mahnmal) for WWII (and WWI) more than weekly (the answer that would have the highest frequency). 
Edit: As someone has stated this memorials are for the fallen soldiers of these wars.

Actually, I'm currently living in the Netherlands and what you describe sounds hard to believe.

I've also been informed that the government grants for all master students are being retroactively transformed into loans. I have seen no students even considering the possibility of banding together to negotiate acceptable alternatives. 

&gt; I guess the thing that needs to happen is something that a) gives back (the feeling of) control to the Greek people so that the government will again have enough popular support to make the tough calls, and b) use this support to actually implement good solutions to systematic problems.

Point A seems hard to pull off. Give enough power to the populace the creditors will either have to make concessions or let Greece unilaterally do as it pleases. Both seem highly undesirable.

You gotta start somewhere.

&gt; Actually, I'm currently living in the Netherlands and what you describe sounds hard to believe.

Actually, it is almost per definition, because unions almost always sanction or plan the strike, and are in all cases member of one of three 'Vakcentrales', which in turn take part in pretty much any negotiation.

The question of the matter is however, do the protesters in Greece have a diplomatic arm in a similar way?

&gt; Did this result in lawsuits?
Last I heard is that the State made a profit, but I'm that's all I know.

&gt; I have seen no students even considering the possibility of banding together to negotiate acceptable alternatives.

You are in luck, because I do personally ;) Some friends of mine are in med-school and for them the problem is even worse because it takes longer to graduate. There was talk of an organized protest by all Dutch medical student associations few months back. Also, there are the ISO and LSVb, who are permanently lobbying in the Hague for students, and if you look at their website you'll see pretty much all energy is focused on this now.

Again, I was just giving and example of the only country I know well. Has Greece similar things? Or is something stewing?

&gt; And even if it happened, it would hardly get us any money to run our economy so I'm not sure why it should be a priority now.

Times of crisis are usually the best time to get tough shit like that through.

We talked a lot about your last elections because of Barack Obama and he's still very popular in France. What I think right now from what we can see in French media about US elections is that Obama will loose and that the Republican candidate will be the next president, so choosing this candidate is a matter of real importance. Of course, we're used to have a social healthcare and we didn't understand why it was such a problem for most US citizens to have one and why it made people turn against Obama... If a prime minister or a president in France tried to remove the social healthcare, he would have no chance to be reelected.

true,CountVonTroll,null,null,"I'm a native speaker and I'm not sure about whether to use *sie* or *du* sometimes. It's becoming less strict, the old rules don't always apply anymore. Generally, I think this is a good development, but sometimes you end up in situations where you're uncertain which form to is more appropriate. For example, my parents (in their sixties) have recently moved, and they've made new friends and have new neighbors. So, when I (thirties) visit them, I often meet friends or neighbors of theirs whom I haven't met before. Technically, I'd have to address them with *sie*, until they (senior) formally offer me the *du*. Depending on the situation and how close they are with my parents, however, a *sie* could be almost as inappropriate as an unwelcome *du*. So I have to make the call based on what I know about that person, if anything, and the first impression, or awkwardly avoid using either until they have addressed me first -- and they have the same problem.  
As you wrote, you use *du* with friends and family (the latter wasn't always the case, btw., a bit over a hundred years ago children used *sie* when addressing their parents). But nowadays it's also being used to express friendliness and familiarity. A salesperson in ""young and hip"" clothing store might use *du*, for example, and you wouldn't use *sie* to address another patron in a bar at night. If I was to address another Redditor with *sie* in a German subreddit, this would be a statement in itself, and it would *not* be one of politeness and respect.  
Don't let this confuse you, though, as a non-native speaker nobody expects you to always get it right.

Your question is still too vague. :)

You've mentioned you'll stay in Einbeck, of which I've never heard before. How'd you end up there, of all places? Are you looking for day-trip destinations in the area? (This seems to be in the middle of nowhere, bring books.) Or do you plan to travel further? If so, are you more into old castles (go South-West), picturesque little towns, or big cities? Is your mom a history-buff or does your dad love model trains? You should probably make another post a week or so before you leave, so we can consider festivals and so on, and ask for more specific suggestions.

Regarding general advice, don't expect every store to accept credit cards. There's an alternative electronic payment system vendors prefer, but you'd need a European bank account to use it.  
There also are some cultural differences you should be aware of. [This article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13545386) is about British-German communication, but the general idea applies to English language rituals in general. Communication in German is more direct, while English speakers have a tendency to ~~sugarcoat everything~~ be very polite. Like English speakers perceive Germans as too direct and unfriendly, Germans often perceive (especially American) English speakers as superficial and the ritual friendliness as overly enthusiastic or even ""fake"". When Walmart initially had greeters during their failed attempt to get a foothold in the German market, customers perceived this as downright creepy. If a waitress seems stressed out, that's because she had a hard day, and that's fine (btw., she's probably not avoiding you, but just leaving you alone so you can enjoy your meal without her interrupting you all the time). The cultural aspects of communication are often overlooked, especially when the person you're talking to has a good vocabulary and grammar.

The region has amazing landscapes and beautiful little cities and villages. If you are into sports, I suggest you get a bicycle and explorer the region. It's worth it.

The institutions of university a spread across the cities of Kleve, Emmerich and Kamp-Lintfort, all of the nice little city with high quality of living but little action. If you are coming from New York, you will have the feeling that you are living somewhere in the Midwest, just without the bible stuff and with a much, much better transportation system. Depending on where you will live and study there are different options to find at least little bit of night life and some job opportunities. If you will end up in Kleve or Emmerich, you will living close to the Dutch border and the cities of Nijmegen and Arnhem. Both aren't huge cities either, but they will have much more to offer in terms of fun and job opportunities. And they have dope. If I were you and about to study in Kleve or Emmerich, I'd live in Nijmegen. Living and studying in two countries at once, in the heart of the European Union, can be an amazing experience, even if the night life isn't very spectacular.

If you end up in Kamp-Lintfort however, you will be close to cities like Moers or Krefeld. Not as beautiful as Nijmegen maybe, but with some night life and job opportunities as well. Keep in mind that as student you can travel the entire state of North Rhine-Westphalia for free (with the local traffic transportation system, not with the ICEs).

Conclusion: If you are interested in a vibrant night life and student community, then the region hasn't very much to offer, although there many little universities in that region. There are opportunities though and can be very rewarding to live and study in that region. The region isn't exactly known for it's universities, and if you more interested into a vibrant student culture, I suggest you look for different university in the Rhine-Ruhr area, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Bonn or maybe Münster, if you want to stay in North Rhine-Westphalia.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"The problem with the unions in Greece is that they have been de-legitimised along with the political system. They at least partly deserve this, since they were a major source of corruption in the system. The mass media also helped with this de-legitimisation by portraying union leaders as unreasonable people who want everything for themselves. 

So, after the crisis broke out, new forms of lobbying began to emerge, although it seems they are still in their infancy. The ""indignants"" movement was all about peaceful demonstration. The government tried to be friendly with them but didn't really seem ready to negotiate anything with them. After all, the terms of the bailout are set by the creditors and are not negotiable. The government can't really negotiate a truce with social groups because it has neither the will nor the ability to implement the agreement. 

The old unions are still active, by the way. They organise strikes and sometimes even occupy their workplaces. I guess in the Netherlands even the threat of a strike must bring some results. However, in Greece, even if a strike is carried out the politicians never seem to back down. In the old days, the unions would sit with the politicians and talk. In Greece, when you vote you select a party but you also select from a list which of the politicians you want to get a seat in the parliament. Most people vote for just the party and leave the other thing blank. That means that an organised minority, like a union can pretty much have a huge say on who gets elected. So, that's what they did to negotiate. Nowadays, the politicians know they won't be elected anyway, so they don't care about that. 

As for the students, they usually voice their concerns by doing assemblies and voting resolutions. There is some sort of joint assembly union thing but it's mostly inactive. When the government inevitably fails to back down then the students occupy the universities and schools. Then the government just waits it out. 

So, you see, it's a failure from both sides: the protesters don't try to negotiate much and the government is always decisive enough to follow through with their policy no matter what the protests do. 

So, all in all, lobbying seems pretty ineffectual for two reasons: First, the state has no leeway to change the policy because it's not really set by them. Second, neither side is really willing to negotiate and make concessions. 

&gt; Times of crisis are usually the best time to get tough shit like that through.

It depends. On one hand, this is indeed the time to pass difficult legislation because the politicians have nothing to lose. On the other hand, what kind of legislation will they pass with their new-found freedom? I'm inclined to believe that they're more willing to push neoliberal de-regulatory stuff to help their rich capitalist friends than things that will actually help everyone.

&gt; Il faut cependant noté que tous les restaurants ne rémunèrent pas de la même façon. Certains proposent des primes bi-annuelles aux équipiers, d'autre rien du tout. Certains managers ont des primes bi-mensuel, bi-annuel, rien du tout ... 

&gt; Le salaire est un élément important et les étudiants peuvent espérer gagner entre 300 et 600 euros, les équipiers de moins d'un an peuvent envisager d'arriver rapidement au 1000 euros, ensuite la moyenne des swings avoisinant les 1200 euros, les managers confirmés touchant souvent plus de 1500 euros. Rien de bien extraordinaire me direz-vous ...

In this context Germany is way more federal than France. Some evidence:
French Roads are orientated towards Paris, while German roads form a net. The TGV connection between Dijon and Strasbourg last year was almost a revolution :)

German institutions are spread in the country (government is in Berlin, the biggest stock market and airport in Frankfurt, the suprime court in Karlsruhe...) In France all national institutions are in Paris.

Culturally it is a different question. As I said in the beginning, I know about the different traditions e.g. culinary art in France. Nevertheless I have no idea, how to compare it to other countries and it's probably stupid to do a competition on that ;)

I don't know. Maybe if all the social movements that we have now start evolving into something more comprehensive, then the political and social situation might turn for the better. 

But that means little without a working economy and that depends more on the international community than Greece right now.

&gt; What can you guys tell me about Rhein-Waal University?

It was only founded 3 years ago and most likely will not appear in any ranking. Also, there are not even physically settled, still moving campuses and probably most of their processes are not mature yet. 3 year old university sounds like quite a risk to me.

&gt; Should I pick another university?

I'd say yes. But it depends on your motives for having chosen Rhein-Waal in the first place, like subject you want to study, location of the university, costs and admission pre-requisites.

&gt; Is it cheap to live in that region?

Yes. Not as cheap as in the east, but definitely not as expensive as Hamburg or Munich.

&gt; What are the job prospect for non-German speakers

For engineers very good at the moment.

&gt; teaching English? 

Not so good and if you land a job, not well paid.

My own two cents (I live in Paris since 2004): If you happen to be white and live intra muros, you'll probably never ever be searched by police unless you do something quite stupid. So carrying a folding knife should be fine.

The EU has no problem bailing out banks and justifying that by saying that if the banks collapse then people's lives will be adversely affected. But when it comes to actually *helping the people directly*, suddenly the discourse shifts from the excusatory ""by saving the banks we're indirectly saving you!"" to the paternalistic ""there's no free lunch"" rhetoric. What bull. 

&gt;As for the other side’s vision of unconditional funds flowing into Greece to finance job creation, it ignores the issue of moral hazard, and, more importantly, does not take into account that economic growth will be virtually impossible to achieve without restored investor confidence in the country, which in turn requires significant debt reduction and restructuring.

Indeed, there'll be no investor confidence in Greece if Greece defaults. But nobody's confident in Greece *right now* either! Debt restructuring further prolongs this situation of no confidence.

true,Carnelov,null,null,"Sarkozy n'a pas délégué grand' chose...?
Mais les politiques nationales et la conjoncture impactent différemment l'Etat et les collectivités selon le niveau de déconcentration/décentralisation.
Ces deux notions font référence aux marges de manoeuvres des collectivités. Les régions et municipalités (ainsi que les EPCI : communautés de communes, par ex.) ont gagné en indépendance. Une majeure partie de leurs budgets sont des budgets d'investissement.

Les départements, quant à eux, n'arrivent plus à suivre. Ils ont à gérer (principalement) les routes (on leur a délégué la quasi-totalité des routes nationales, sous Sarkozy !), le RSA (...tout de même...), les collèges...
Il s'agit uniquement de ""déconcentration"" de missions pour lesquelles la gestion locale n'a aucun impact. Si une route est en mauvais état, il faut l'entretenir. Le RSA et son montant dépendent de politiques nationales, pas locales. Quant aux collèges, les départements doivent également les entretenir (même si les profs sont payés par l'administration centrale). 
Les problèmes liés à ces derniers sont directement associés aux budgets des collectivités (départements) plutôt qu'à l'administration centrale.

L'INSEE peut vous fournir (en plus des liens déjà donnés) des informations synthétiques sur les finances publiques.

Ah oui, je me dis que ta question n'est peut-être pas bien posée. Que les dépenses publiques aient augmentées ou non sous Sarkozy n'est pas très pertinent. Les dépenses peuvent augmenter mais l'inflation et/ou les impôts bien plus, par exemple. Les dépenses peuvent augmenter mais pour des raisons purement conjoncturelles (crise mondiale...). Les dépenses peuvent diminuer mais de façon chaotique et mal gérées. Etc.

Ce qui gène avec la gestion de la crise par notre Président, ce n'est pas vraiment qu'il ait augmenté les dépenses. C'est surtout qu'il a réduit les recettes potentielles TOUT EN augmentant les dépenses. Les problématiques de ""niches fiscales"" découlent typiquement de ce genre de questionnements. Idem pour les ""cadeaux aux riches"", etc.

La Cour des Comptes avait ainsi estimée qu'une très grande majorité du déficit et de la dette nouvellement créée sous Sarkozy était le fait de ses politiques budgétaires et fiscales, et non provoquées par la crise.

Structurellement, on peut ""excuser"" Sarkozy qui a grosso-modo prolongé la tradition française du clientélisme politique et des dépenses à tout-va. Sarkozy n'a jamais été un libéral. Il a par contre été terriblement interventionniste et le poids de l'Etat dans les décisions économiques et sociales fut aussi important lors de son mandat que sous ses prédécesseurs. 

Par contre, là où il aurait pu réformer en profondeur l'Etat et son fonctionnement en raison de la crise et de son volontarisme... il a effectivement suivi le modèle franco-français d'absence totale de gestion ""intelligente"" des finances publiques (voir comment le principe d'évaluation n'a jamais été réellement appliqué...). 

En attendant, la dette publique a explosée de vingt points de PIB, passant de 65% à 85% environ du PIB, de 2007 à 2011.
(Voir le fichier Excel sur cette page.)

http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/theme.asp?theme=16&amp;sous_theme=3.1

A noter que les administrations locales ont augmenté leurs dépenses de 30 milliards environ sur la même période, la sécu de 70 milliards... et l'Etat, de près de 400 milliards d'euros.

La dette locale n'est qu'un faux débat. Les situations problématiques se concentrent soit à des produits financiers bizarres (Dexia...), soit à l'effondrement des prêteurs ""habituels"" des collectivités (Dexia... en démantèlement). Pourquoi l'impact est limité ? Parce qu'aucune collectivité n'a le droit d'emprunter pour financer des dépenses de fonctionnement. Point. La ""règle d'or"", les collectivités l'appliquent. C'est une méconnaissance totale des finances publiques qui poussent les journaleux et militants à répéter comme des perroquets les arguments du pouvoir en place (qui ferait de même s'il était de gauche...) : la dette, c'est soit lié aux collectivités, soit à l'Europe, soit à la crise, etc.

L'autre problème des finances locales tient dans ce phénomène de ""déconcentration"". En pleine crise, les départements doivent assurer un max de demande d'aides sociales...

Also, up until very recently American Italian food strongly mirrored took almost all of its roots from Neapolitan and Sicilian cuisine. Only recently have we seen more central and northern influences poked their head into the mix.  

It's not that controversial or disputed.  It's not a positive or negative statement, it's just sort of a fact. 

Edit: the [Mezzogiorno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy#After_1861) wikipedia page also outlines the fact:
&gt;The Southern economy greatly suffered after the Italian unification and the process of industrialization was interrupted. Poverty and organized crime, though were persistent problems in Southern Italy as well and it got worse after the unification. Because of this, the South experienced great economic difficulties resulting in massive emigration leading to a worldwide Southern Italian diaspora, especially to the United States and South America.

On the other hand, we have Dutch politicians facing the same issue with unhappy electorate and unpopular budget cuts.

Ironically, Meneer Wilder's little website might have actually helped us in this case, since the Dutch need to keep up to their image of being tolerant and what better way to show that then letting us join the Schengen area.

Personally, I don't think there are that many benefits of joining Schengen. Please let me know if I'm missing something, but apart from joining SIS and abolishing border control, what are any other implications? Sure, it will make trade a bit easier and faster, but I do not think the result would be an enormous boost of the local economy.

I'm just about done with the second section (history) and my reading comprehension has improved tremendously in the last two months. On top of that, I also downloaded every season of futurama in italian, and I usually cap the night off with an episode or two. I'd try to find some show that you've already seen a lot of in English and get the Italian version. On top of that, I'm playing Final Fantasy VIII in Italian, and downloading FFVII at the moment to play when I'm done. If you're into RPG's, I'd highly recommend getting a few in your target language. I also have Suikoden II that I'll be working through at some point later on. 

Pimsleur is an awesome way to get started, and thats what I used to give myself a crash course in the language. Afterwards, I would work off of the list that you'll find [here](http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=2091). Check out all the links that frenkeld posts and you'll find some of the amazon books that mancusod may have been referring to. 

One last thing. If you do decide to play an RPG in Italian, I'd recommend going through [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Italian-Verb-Drills-Third/dp/0071744738/ref=pd_sim_b_1) beforehand. I started playing FF8 and doing the verb book at the same time, and now that I've finished the verb book I really wish I had done that first. If you do a chapter every day or two, you'll understand the verbs and their tenses really quickly. I went to college for Spanish, and it was a grueling experience trying to learn from the professors. I've only been studying Italian for about 3 months now, and I've progressed more in that time than in my first 2 and a half years in Spanish (granted, I was in high school, but still). 

So I'd say just work off the list from the language site, and try to spend at least 1.5-2 hours a day in the language. For vocab, I buy packs of 1000 flash cards (you'll definitely need some kind of memorization system for the Easy Reader, don't let the name fool you) and that works pretty well for me.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I think this is fundamentally a problem of long-term vs. short-term views. Germany takes the long term approach. To a certain degree this is cultural, but it's also rather easy to focus on the long term when you don't feel the effects of an acute crisis at home.

The way I see it, the main arguments for the current German approach are that *some* reforms and austerity measures are actually necessary. This is certainly true for Greece, and I very much doubt that the Greek political system would be capable of pulling through with such reforms if it wasn't for a very real and immediate threat of default. No, Greeks aren't lazy, but what is it they actually produce? So much is lost to the inefficiencies that come out of their dysfunctional bureaucracy that they'd be right back where they are today within a decade or two even if all of their debt would magically vanish. I also believe this to be true for Italy, albeit to a much lesser extend, and I'm pretty sure that especially the North has the potential to very quickly become just as strong economically as Austria and Germany to the North of the Alps after such reforms.  
Ireland, however, is really just in a temporary rough spot that they have to make it through. Spain needs investments to develop alternatives to construction, austerity will only endanger any existing basis they could build upon. The problem here is that, even though all those countries are in entirely different situations and require different solutions, they can't realistically be treated differently. How could the EU force Greece through devastating austerity while financing a Spanish long term structural reform? What makes this even more difficult is that the money just isn't easily available, and that it might still be needed in case the shit hits the fan (even more than it already has).

Then there's the other problem, that of a functioning Eurozone. Again, there are steps that need to be taken but that are politically so difficult that they hadn't been possible before the introduction of the euro, or during the two decades that followed. Nobody is willing to sacrifice sovereignty, not even for long term stability. This isn't about solving *this* crisis, but about preventing the next one, and about avoiding the moral hazard of setting a precedent where the Eurozone hands out a carte blanche for national parliaments to make budgetary decisions that affect us all. If we don't fix this now, we won't fix it until the next crisis comes, either.

We *have* made progress, though. This isn't the same situation that we were in a couple of months ago. I see the Fiscal Compact as a first step towards a proper fiscal union for the Eurozone. But Hollande is right that it should have included a chapter about a growth policy. I don't think renegotiating it is a good idea, but amending it, as he now puts it, might well be. People need a viable perspective of eventual economic improvement, they need to know what they're actually enduring the austerity for.

I think Merkel was right not to make too many financial concessions without safeguards that a similar situation will be prevented in the future, but now it's time to put the cards on the table and declare what a framework that would provide such safeguards would look like, and how it would lead the periphery to growth, through permanent transfers if necessary.

However this comes at the expense of others. The question is, has the european economy grown as a whole. I think not, and now with this austerity parts of Europe are going to collapse. And this will come back to cause a problem for Germany too when they have nobody to sell to, or, the loans that they gave out to potential buyers can no longer be repaid. 

Then when all this blows over, Germany will find themselves with a significant loss of economic development since the last few years. The boom time was artificial. This is why Germany can not allow the Eurozone to break up, and why they are forcing economic slavery on anybody who could set off this process. It's also why Germany will be the ultimate and biggest victim of this pact.

Speculators: ha! Greece is gonna default.. apocalypse!! war!! blar blar blar!!

Europe: okay...

Speculators: hmm.. Greece actually defaulted!!!

Europe: ok, so?

Speculators: nvm.. lets go make some money from speculating on the [UK](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17375585) and [Norway](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-14/norway-invites-krone-speculation-amid-interest-rate-shock.html).

Btw.. I've had some experience in how speculators make money using forex trading. They give you an opposing signal, like for example that the UK is doing crappy, then they take the currency pair they like.. such as GBP-USD and make quite a sizeable transaction betting that it will go up in the very short term because when they buy with a sizeable amount it will push it upwards and people will see this and do the same thing thinking they are riding a nice wave upwards and that speculation isn't being taken seriously. While this is happening, they try to slowly sell to the people who are buying for a small profit, and when they are almost done and the upwards trend has almost died out, they immediately execute a very large sell transaction which makes a sizeable downward line on their forex trading software and everyone starts panic selling because when it starts going down, it goes down quite fast and they start thinking that perhaps stuff is really bad as suggested in their speculation earlier. This is how they make millions of profits from speculation. They like uncertainty and fear. The way that currency trading takes place today is very similar to gambling, and any measures that have been proposed keep getting shot down by the UK... so it would be quite funny if this started happening to their own currency just as it happened to the euro many times already. Basically, in order to make money in the market.. growth is painfully slow but collapse is rapid fast profits. These people don't care what it is they are trading, they only care about the difference between what they bought something and what they sold it at. They eventually have to stop with a specific currency pair, because once idiots with big ideas of making money on the forex market have lost several millions (""protect the value of your money by buying us dollars and then taking euros when they are cheaper, netting you a profit""), they need to move onto another group of idiots.

To add something more to this, this is why they want all sorts of idiots to come and ""play"" forex trading with high leverage (""make money faster"").. Do you honestly think that because you got 200:1 leverage and you put $1000 into your account that you suddenly have ""$200000"" and you're going to find a way to make lots of money (theoretically possible, but my calculations say you have a 95% chance to lose your $1000 because of the way the market jumps up and down). Due to leverage, the moment the market changes to what you thought it would do, the margin you have for being wrong is very small.. so suppose you try to ride the upward wave with your high leverage account thinking you're gonna make money... as soon as that sizeable sell transaction hits, your account margin is gonna go to zero and that speculator has your $1000 -- congratulations, you have now lost $1000.. and a few thousand other idiots did too -- which is why you may have noticed lots of ads around the internet telling you about easy account set up with free starting money and lots of different bullshitters telling you about how you can easily make money on the forex market :) Unless you have millions of euros of actual money with low leverage (and become a speculator yourself), you will always lose. The scam is the leverage.

Oh btw.. a lot of speculators are based out of the USA.. so the euro being destroyed and the us dollar being healthy benefits them. All the media, banks and ratings agencies are in on this scam too.. so when it starts going the other way they try to distract people and try to remind people about other people doing bad (omg.. China is gonna grow by ONLY 7% this year... they're going in for a crash!! :O).. so if the europeans are not budging anymore and the euro probably won't be destroyed, they just pick another target.. oh and if someone starts getting onto them.. [they start making shit up](http://i.imgur.com/x2LUq.png).. just like they like to spin stuff like ""hmm.. employment is increasing in Germany.. is this a sign that the euro is about to collapse?""

They might get turned off by the bureaucracy this implies. To be able to hire you, they have to demonstrate that there is no viable applicant with an EU work permit. How difficult this is, and whether it's even a realistic possibility, depends on your qualifications.  
Some professions have a special status, due to a labor shortage in their sectors, and they can just hire you normally. Probably some time this summer, this will be expanded further, and it will finally become easy to hire professionals if their salary is above a threshold that is much lower than the current one.

He also stated that in no way does the action of one party reflect the sentiment of an entire government. It also has no effect on the policies for migration from those countries at all.

true,icandoitbetter,null,null,"Yes, Greece will still have to pay its creditors (but only about 25% of the original amount).

So here we have two kinds of defaults. The implication of the first kind of default (let's call it D1), the default that we all understand, is straightforward: Greece doesn't have to pay anyone back. This is not the default that happend here (even though I saw some US media reporting that D1 happened - journalism at its best). 

And then we have the second kind of default (let's call it D2) that credit agencies have declared, which is basically the **credit event** of triggering CDS payments. What are CDS? They are a financial instrument that insures companies who have bought debt against the possibility of the debtor defaulting. So banks that bought Greek debt but wanted to minimize their losses from a potential default may also have bought Greek CDS, which is a payment to those banks (by the third-party that sold the CDS) to be made when the credit event occurs. It is in the clauses of the CDS that we find D2 defined: it doesn't only refer to D1, but also to cases of extreme debt restructuring (the scenario we are dealing with here), and specifically ""involuntary"" debt restructuring.  How can one define ""involuntary""? It describes the scenario where banks are ""forced"" to write down their debt by the activation of collective action clauses (CACs). The CACs are a legal mechanism retroactively added to the Greek bonds (i.e. after Greece issued the bonds) that allowed Greece to say: ""if a majority of the bondholders agree to write down the debts, then everyone else has to do it as well."" Since Greece made use of the CACs in this case, we are talking about an ""involuntary"" debt restructuring and so D2 happened.

Not to talk about the lost potential (the economic data of  interbellum period in Finland and the Baltic countries is equal, afther the soviet occupation the GDP is about half that of Finland).

true,JB_UK,null,null,"That was interesting, thanks. Another thing I can add is that the risk calculations banks make are based on the Black-Scholes formula, which is itself based on physical equilibrium models. So they assume that fluctuations in the stock market are analogous, for instance, to molecular evaporation and condensation, that although there is movement in both directions, one tends to outweigh the other to provide a forcing towards the equilibrium position, which is based on some underlying property (temperature, pressure on the one hand, or the strength of such and such economy, or scarcity/abundance of this or that commodity, or a million other things on the other). But of course, one molecule doesn't decide its behaviour by looking at its neighbours, like a trader is always watching the market. If the temperature cools down a gas molecule reacts to the underlying properties of the system, plus chance, it doesn't condense because everyone else is doing it. So the risk calculations drastically underestimate, or perhaps even ignore the feedback within the system, and hence the probability of boom and bust. For those eventualities banks take out CDS's, and the prospect of paying out on those appear to act as the final dynamite buried underneath the system.

true,belgianguy,BELG,Belgium,"I think many Europeans will once look back and be glad the sane politicians did not give in to the pleas of 'give us money and just hope for the best'. A common currency ties the fate of all those who use it, and a single bad apple can really ruin it for everybody. If such a bad apple is to be helped, the least it can do is agree that they are to evolve into a better situation. Otherwise the helping party risks spending its hard earned money on something that didn't improve in the slightest. The fact that a country was able to reach such a dire situation could (in my eyes) allow for some monitoring activity to take place, at least until the subject is healthy again. While austerity is a part of this process, I also expect that the same Europe that tightened its grip on wayward countries, will also help them to get on their feet again. 

It's my personal belief that Greece needed a long overdue reality check. It would be foolish to believe that just by adding extra money to the mix, the machine would somehow function differently than before. Some cogs needed to be replaced, some parts were no longer needed and some were just consuming fuel and not delivering any output. Just asking to change them would probably not dig deep enough to remedy the broken parts. While I have no proof to back this up, I do suspect that Greece was made an example to all other countries that would be planning on pulling the same stunts.

Furthermore, at least a better fiscal regulation is taking form. The 'fire extinguisher'-approach is too tiresome and particularly vulnerable to multiple countries going down in flames at once, splitting and consequently depleting the resources in a moment's notice. It also tends to highlight the problems when the flames are already through the roof. A better system would be to install some sort of sprinkler system which would activate on the faintest hints of smoldering, and at least send out a warning signal to the fire department before the structure catches fire.

You could *maybe* get away if you're only using private trackers, or if you're downloading unpopular stuff, but still sooner or later it's gonna bite you in the ass.

The best option if you want to torrent is to either pay a VPN provider for encrypted connection, or using OCHs like rapidshare. Sure, you'll have to pay to download, but it's gonna be much cheaper than getting an *Abmahnung* once. I had to pay 1200€ for downloading twelve tracks of an popular album.

Here's how it works: Companies track popular files on bittorrent. If you get caught uploading, they will charge you with Uhrheberrechtsverletzung (copyright infrigment). This will have no further consequences because the courts will  usually not pursue this because of insignificance. 
But, they will get access to your data (Name, Address etc...) and use this to send you an *Abmahnung*. An Abmahnung is basically an demand to stop a certain behaviour *that does not involve any court*. They will send you a so called *Unterlassungserklärung*, which is basically a document in which you state that you *will not do something in the future*, like sharing files of their clients. 

If you do not sign this Unterlassungserklärung they could sue you in court. If they do this, they will usually estimate that you will continue to share the files indefinitely, which will raise the amount of dispute to 6-figures. Since court and lawyer fees are calculated as a percentage of amount of dispute, this will get *very expensive*. 

The amount you have to pay for the Abmahnung is not because of some penalty, but because they will bill you *their* lawyer costs, which are usually really high.



Another thing that I have to mention is the liablity of the *Anschlussinhaber*. Whoever is the registered owner of the line connecting you to the Internet is obligated to make sure no illegal activies are done there. Meaning: If your landlord, or even your universtity provide you with internet access, they're the ones who will receive the Abmahnung. Do not make the error of confessing to the company which send you the Abmahnung because then *you'll have to pay* and the Anschlussinhaber *also has to pay*, which will most likely just make things more expensive.

If you confess to the Anschlussinhaber is your thing, but if the evidence is strong enough that you did indeed commit the copyright infrigment, whoever is Anschlussinhaber could sue you in civil court to pay the costs of the Abmahnung, even when the company who send you the Abmahnung knows nothing about it.
