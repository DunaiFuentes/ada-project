Need sources. When UK joined European Parliament didn't have any power; it now has more than ever and is gaining more with every revision of the charter. Everybody is represented according to population.  What could be more democratic? 

European Parliament appoints the Commission (and can also fire them, if needed); this is how executive bodies are chosen in all European states, including UK. In fact this is more democratic that the situation in most states, as President of the Commission isn't also the head of the biggest party in the Parliament (then he would in essence be firing himself). Situation like the Blair - Brown transfer could never happen in the Commission.

The Council is appointed by the states and each area gets one vote; they decide on things unanimously. This is also as democratic as things could ever be.

The President of the Council is voted on by the Council. Everybody gets a say. How is this not democratic?

And how would you improve the situation?

&gt;When we joined it was mainly a economic union.

There was [EFTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association), which was like European Communities but only with the economic part. It was founded in large part because integration in the larger framework was not desired by UK (and it linked to EC-economic area, so it wasn't even that it was the ""smaller club""). Britain left EFTA and joined EC knowing that this would involve the ""the larger framework"". And know you're bitching because EC/EU isn't EFTA.

&gt;That said, I don't know what we've done to be the main problem in the EU..

I didn't say ""main problem"" I said ""many of the problems"". As singular problems go, there are bigger. I was referring to ""1000 cuts"" versus ""stab to the heart"". 

&gt;""..and it seems like you don't either.""

Well, most of these things would have been talked about before anything had been agreed upon. They were public, but it's hard to remember afterwards what was planned vs. what actually happened.

There is nothing to back up this optimistic claim.  And if you read the comments here it's clear that changes in attitudes are sadly slow in coming.

It's on tv,music and films. The vast majority of parents immigrant or not don't bother to sit down and teach their kids languages. It's to much effort for most parents.

Opposing austerity now, is not ""we want more money"" is ""we won't pay back anything if you don't allow us to have a way to generate money"".

Now what happened was not only the announced 7% increase on TSU (that is in fact a 64% increase on what was paid). That was only one of the meassures announced and the first. After that, on the following thursday there were announced much more, like the IRS increase (that will mean another 4-5% salary cut), pensions cut of 3 to 10%, new taxes, new cuts on health and education, etc. a extensive austerity package to add on current austerity. 

With all the uproar there were two reaction by Europe that increased the anger at the EU, especially when the IMF is not that keen on the new austerity. Oli Rehn saying Portugal had to do everything imposed or won't receive the next part of the loan and Merkel saying austerity must go on whatever the cost.

The thing most people here and the EU politicians don't understand is that people are now against the wall, if you are a public worker you lost up to 10% wage, then you lost 2 wages on top of that, now you will lose even more with the TSU increase (it can mean a extra wage loss for some, adding to the two already lost) then you will lose another 4-5% with the IRS increase, while inflation keeps getting up, energy cost went up almost 20%, public transportation on average went up 15%, property tax will have a huge increase next year, VAT had stupid increases like restaurants increasing from 6% to 23%, and it goes on and on.

This was a move that was very unpopular in the States and Clinton heard a lot of complaints for it.

Actually, neither of them did a pretty good job at it. Vlip basically confirmed my fear that there is the clear danger that the tax evaders simply move their money and Switzerland then waves it's hands. And the terms of those agreements are less than sufficient to appeal to my sense of justice - and a ton of other people here, too. 

From everything I read to far, the agreements would mean that you'll pay about the same or even less as if you hadn't evaded your taxes in the first place (depending on whether the original amount was black money or not). 

But if you have your money in Switzerland for 10 years, then *all* of it should get confiscated, as fees and penalties would amount to more than 100 % (you have around 1 %/month in interest on owed taxes).  And rightly so, because if you'd done the same thing there, that would be what happens.

And krattr so far only posted links dealing with Germany. It shouldn't really be his concern about what *we* regard as ""lawful"" (just as we don't care about the Swiss POV), but even then:

- courts here have upheld that the CDs can in fact be used for prosecution.
- my uneducated guess is that the proposal to outlaw buying CDs has zero chance of going through the Bundesrat. It's a bone they let the FDP have so they can pick on it. And if it does, it will bite them in the ass in the coming election. The SPD will have a field day over it.

Apart from that, it really boggles my mind that on the one side, they speak about laws and how they must be followed, when they've been spitting in the face of the Maastricht treaty - which is international law, in case someone has forgotten - for years now.

And I really chose my words carefully: *if* the posters here are in any way representative to the rest of the population - ie they aren't the least bit outraged about this, be it through ignorance like Garitsos or the pretext of ""how the law is so important (when otherwise they don't seem to care)"" like krattr  - *then*, yes, they really should think about if they don't deserve the mess they're currently in.

Because I really can't understand that frame of mind. Sorry.

Yes I agree totally. 

But I don't think that there needs to be a NATO type alliance solely consisting of European nations, there is already infrastructure available to allow Europe to act alone, a lot of it comes from the NATO infrastructure that allows it's members to cooperate militarily.

The European Defence Agency exists and there's Common Security and Defence Policy within Europe that includes none member nations.

In 2010 the The Defence and Security Co-operation Treaty was signed between Britain and France to "" develop co-operation between British and French Armed Forces, the sharing and pooling of materials and equipment including through mutual interdependence, the building of joint facilities, mutual access to each other’s defence markets, and industrial and technological co-operation.""

If there's one area of European integration Britain isn't shying away from it's a sensible approach to defence.

The command structure isn't dependant on the USA, and that's the hardest issue to solve. Ammunition and equipment is standardised (funnily enough British tanks don't fire the same ammunition as the rest of NATO's equipment) , and nations have a history of working together through command. For military hardware pan European projects have existed within the Aerospace industry (Think Eurofighter and before that the Panavia Tornado).

What it basically comes down to is equipment, if we want to act as the EU without the USA's involvement then there needs to be a huge investment in military by each of the nations. And every nation in Europe has to take part that includes Sweden, Finland, Austria. It's not the role of the UK/France/Germany/Holland to defend all 750 million inhabitants of the EU or defend their interests.

So the jist of my point is that Europe would easily be able to act on its own if it were to just spend more money on defence.

Yes, we need America because no European countries other than France and the UK make any kind of serious commitment to defence. 

&gt;Similarly; you can fight for British dependencies even if you are part of NATO

Only if they are in the North Atlantic. For example the Falklands war did not trigger automatic involvement of all NATO members.

The Falklands War is an instructive example actually because the only countries that helped the UK were the US (missiles, satellite imagery) and France (preventing the sale of more Exocet missiles). 

When the shit hits the fan most European countries have been very reluctant to take concrete steps to help each other, despite their high minded rhetoric. Even when there was a genocide happening on our doorstep it took the USA getting involved to accomplish anything.

La Franc-Maçonnerie s'apparente à une vaste secte qui s'est emparée du pouvoir. On a des gens non élus qui se placent entre eux à des postes de responsabilités, et qui agissent selon des directives fournies par le haut de la pyramide dont on ne sait pas de qui il s'agit, pas même vraiment eux, la base ayant l'impression de faire quelque chose de bien alors qu'en réalité la somme des tâches demandées sert les intérêts de quelques uns au sommet de l'organigramme.

Et ainsi sont couverts des scandales ou étouffées des affaires, ainsi sont prises des décisions sous couvert de vote démocratique alors qu'en réalité ce n'est qu'une mascarade. Et la Franc-Maçonnerie n'est ni de droite ni de gauche, elle est l'UMPS et responsable de ce bipartisme alterné depuis des décennies, elle est le Système que l'on dénonce, elle est les financiers que l'on fustige. Ils ont aussi quelques agents autours, soit pour avoir des pions chez l'ennemi, soit pour brasser des voix et faire pencher la balance.

Beaucoup se réunissent entre eux au Club Le Siècle, mais il y a encore le Bilderberg et bien d'autres, et là il n'y a plus aucun clivage politique, c'est bras dessus bras dessous à dîner et boire de l'alcool ensemble alors que ça fait semblant de s'écharper devant les caméras le reste du temps.

Soft sciences are a bit different. Often there's much more freedom to build your curriculum, so you may not be even expected to attend lectures due to overlaps between courses. Finding a balance is what distinguishes good students, in many cases. Lectures are split in a curricular part and a separate topic that varies every year, perhaps based on the professor's own research; for example, in a Medieval history exam you might have readings throughout the semester on the evolution of the historiography of the battle of Salaminchia. Part of the material may not even exist in books or journals (yet). If you do attend, the exam (typically oral) will be more biased towards those readings and lectures, and focus less on things that only require memorization. If you don't attend it's the other way round.

Même les préceptes que tu as choisis ne peuvent pas être appliqués de manière absolue, faute de quoi le résultat est soit absurde, soit invivable. Prends, par ailleurs, une question éminemment morale : est-ce que l'avortement est acceptable ? Si on en discute avec des gens raisonnables, on trouvera une variété d'opinions différentes, issues de diverses réflexions, et qui (amha) devraient finir sur un semblant de consensus (c'est un moindre mal), si on en discute avec beaucoup de musulmans, et même de chrétiens, aujourd'hui, on ira pas plus loin que ""c'est mal parce que ma religion dit que c'est mal"". Ce que je défends, c'est la nécessité de pouvoir débattre de ces positionnement moraux, et donc de s'opposer à ces idéologies qui refusent toute réflexion là-dessus, à plus forte raison quand lesdites idéologies sont figées sur leurs préceptes depuis si longtemps que ceux-ci sont en décalage complet avec ce dont le monde actuel a besoin - à savoir un maximum de pondération et de réflexion. 

Je sais que ça peut paraître alarmiste et exagéré aux yeux de quelqu'un qui vit dans un pays laïque dont la religion dominante est en train de poursuivre à un rythme admirable son effondrement, mais prête attention au monde qui t'entoure, étudie un peu les systèmes moraux basés sur des vérités révélées que proposent les religions, connais notre histoire, regarde quelle est l'origine (ou le catalyseur) des principaux conflits actuellement en cours, l'intérêt que tous les tyrans ont à encourager les religions (ou le culte de la personnalité, pareil), comme elles prolifèrent partout là où s'installe la misère et l'ignorance, et à quel point leurs mensonges sont désespérément évidents aux yeux de toute personne n'ayant pas été 'endoctrinée' par ceux-ci assez jeune.

Pour l'autre point, oui, une nationalité, c'est plus que des papiers aux yeux de ceux qui l'ont. Cependant, le seul point commun entre ceux qui l'ont, c'est le bout de papier, parce qu'autant le sang (nous sommes latins ? celtes ? germains ? caucasiens ? indo-européens ?) que l'histoire (les enfants du christianisme ou de la révolution ? des philosophes grecs ou de l'empire romain ?) ne sont que des mythes fondateurs dans lesquels chacun pioche pour former sa nationalité. Donc, quand tu attaques l'ensemble des 'français', tu t'attaques bel et bien à un bout de papier, parce que c'est le seul point de rencontre entre tous ces gens.

&gt;les préceptes que tu as choisis ne peuvent pas être appliqués de manière absolue

C'est pourquoi il n'existe pas UNE religion chrétienne, ni UNE religion musulmane. D'ailleurs c'est le bordel et personne n'y comprend rien. Déjà à l'intérieur du catholicisme (la variante de christianisme que je connais le mieux), il y a tellement de courants de pensée (appelés [ordres](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_des_congr%C3%A9gations_catholiques), par exemple les Jésuites, les Dominicains ...) que personne ne peut dire ""les cathos pensent que l'avortement devrait être interdit"".

Pour l'Islam, c'est pareil, c'est le bordel ! 

&gt;ces idéologies qui refusent toute réflexion là-dessus, à plus forte raison quand lesdites idéologies sont figées sur leurs préceptes depuis si longtemps que ceux-ci sont en décalage complet avec ce dont le monde actuel a besoin - à savoir un maximum de pondération et de réflexion.

Le débat existe évidemment au sein des religions, et rien n'est figé. Pour le catholicisme, l'idéologie a radicalement changé. Rien n'est resté au moyen age, il y a des conciles qui permettent à l'Eglise d'évoluer (le dernier c'est Vatican 2, qui a duré 3 ans et a fini en 1965). Évoluer à son rythme évidemment, la Religion permettant de trouver de la stabilité (dans la tradition) et des valeurs face à l'absence d'alternative crédible et durable. Mais toujours avec beaucoup de pondération et de réflexion.

&gt;les systèmes moraux basés sur des vérités révélées

On est en désaccord là-dessus. Je trouve que les systèmes moraux de l'Islam et du Christianisme sont très bien. Comme je te l'ai dit : amour, charité, pardon, égalité. D'ailleurs, l'universalisme est une valeur chrétienne (on ira tous au paradis), les pères fondateurs des EUA étaient majoritairement chrétiens, pareil pour les pères fondateurs de l'Europe.

&gt;connais notre histoire, regarde quelle est l'origine (ou le catalyseur) des principaux conflits actuellement en cours

Je la connais bien, et c'est bien plus compliqué que ""la religion et la tyrannie c'est pareil et c'est pas bien"". D'abord, les massacres de religion ne représentent qu'[une infime partie des morts dans le monde](http://necrometrics.com/pre1700a.htm). Ensuite, attribuer des morts à une religion, [c'est compliqué](http://necrometrics.com/gunsorxp.htm).

Finalement, la source principale de conflits dans le monde depuis la seconde guerre mondiale, ce sont les ressources naturelles. C'est indiscutable et évident, je te laisse chercher.

&gt;La pire saloperie jamais inventée par notre espèce, un virus idéologique dont la fonction première est de se perpétuer en empêchant le développement de ce qui le combat efficacement : la séparation des églises et de l'Etat, la liberté d'expression, le rationalisme, l'éducation pour tous.

Manque de discernement, de culture, ou réaction de petit bourgeois ? Je ne sais pas vraiment par où commencer. Si tu avais des arguments, ce serait plus facile.

Quelles sont les valeurs apportées par le mondialisme (à ne pas confondre avec la mondialisation) ?

A part l'exploitation de son prochain, l'individualisme omniprésent, et la destruction de l'environnement, je ne vois pas grand chose de très prometteur dans le développement de l'Europe Occidentale et des EAU ces dernières années, et aucune religion n'en est responsable. Tu proposes quoi ?

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"What you say is correct, although I'd like to remind you that English has become much more widespread in Cyprus in the last few years. One of the reasons has been due to the various immigrants (note: I am not saying anything against immigrants here) from different countries. It's a daily occurrence to go to a pub/bar/cafe and have to order in english because the dude/lady taking the order is a foreigner. Most people don't seem to mind. You must also remember that a lot of tourists make use of these shops all year round, so english is overall a very important language for businesses.

It isn't too far-fetched to say that *at least* 25% of the population are foreigners from various countries, and because it's relatively a small country, it's way easier to run into a foreigner. If I remember correctly, Cyprus was recently listed within the top 5 highest english speaking countries of the EU (minus the countries who have it as their official language such as the UK).

Within the last 2 years or so I have been using english with no problem in 99% of the cases and barely ever talked any greek. This recently changed as I started going out with a cypriot lady, so now I talk some greek too :P

With rising foreign investment and an increasing foreign population in a small country, I believe Cyprus will ""evolve"" into an english speaking country in the not so distant future.. especially if there is a reunification. I doubt turkish cypriots will learn greek or that greek cypriots will learn turkish -- a few might, but in general I think they will talk english between them. But I do believe they will continue to teach greek and/or turkish and will talk that language between their friends and family.

tl;dr: Cyprus is slowly morphing into an english speaking country starting from about 5 years ago.

Je me permets de poster ici pour vous parler de cet ""incident"".
Je suis étudiant en DUT à Sarcelles (là où a eu lieu l'explosion), à 100m du supermarché.
L'engin explosif qui a été utilisé n'est ""qu'une"" grenade à/de plâtre (vidéo d'une explosion : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ_vGqQ_VBg)

Étant en cours à ce moment, j'ai entendu un bruit sourd pas excessivement fort sans savoir ce qu'il se passait.
En allant manger dans le Mc Do du centre commercial (le magasin attaqué se trouve sur un boulevard, à l'entrée du centre commercial), nous avons remarqué la présence de 3 voitures de polices et de 4 camionnettes de pompier.

La zone a été sécurisée, mais nous n'avons vu ni blessés ou aucun dégât visible de l’extérieur. Comme vous avez pu le voir sur la vidéo, une grenade de ce genre n'est que d'une très faible puissance. Si il y a vraiment 4 blessés (j'avais entendu parler d'un seul), ce sont des blessures très légères.

Pour ce qui est d'une rivalité entre les deux principales communautés de la ville (Musulmans et Juifs), après un an d'études sur place, je n'ai jamais vu aucun acte d'incivilité ou de violence entre les habitants. 
Ces gens vivent dans les même cités depuis des années et cohabitent. A coté de ce magasin se trouve des boutiques Halal.

Je ne comprends vraiment pas pourquoi cette histoire est utilisée à l'étranger... Pour montrer que la France est elle aussi touchée par des attaques d'islamistes ? Sincèrement, je pense que les deux personnes qui ont fait ça ne voulaient que créer un mouvement de protestation, tout en sachant que cette attaque n'était qu'un signe.

Je suis allé en cours aujourd'hui, la seule chose qui a changé au niveau de ce magasin, c'est qu'il y a maintenant un vigile à l'entrée.

1°/ How it works in the future
The rates are designed to be slightly higher than the normal rates someone would get by declaring his money (those are your rates, not ours).
The idea is that you can ""buy"" privacy at a slight premium or declare your assets and pay your just rate.
That way, in 100% of the cases the foreign government get's his tax money (or slightly more if people prefer their privacy to tax optimisation).

2°/ Handling the past
A strict reading of Swiss laws would net that not a € ought to be paid to foreign countries since noone broke any swiss laws and that money and their owners are under Swiss jurisdiction.
The compromise is that there will be a one time paiement to normalize the situation. That one time paiement is calculated by a very very complex formula that is supposed to net a fair paiement based on your tax rate, how long the money was there, how much there was etc.
Since we are already compromising by even going there you simply won't get any confiscatory levels of taxation (your ""up to 100%"") since that would go out of the legal grey zone straight into the completely illegal zone.
Added argument is that this deal will get voted on by the Swiss people and there is zero chance that any deal with confiscatory rates will ever get through.

I feel a bit silly arguing with you since your heart doesn't really seem to be in your country's conduct :)

Re #1: I'm OK with. We basically have this here too as ""Quellensteuer"", where you get deducted 26,5 % of your interest earnings directly and you can reclaim the money in your tax return. The government doesn't really *need* your name as long as the taxes are paid.

Your #2 has two sub-cases: the one where the money was simply normal, taxed money that was shuffled into Switzerland and gained undeclared interest - in that case, yes, you pay back taxes and you should be halfway in the clear.

The other case is that the money is not taxed from the start out, which I would assume is a pretty huge amount. And this really shouldn't be handled by some horse-trading and rough guestimates, because this is really criminal behavior.

I don't think anyone in the city will give you trouble if they see you and your other half walking around with a baby; I've always seen Spanish people fawning over kids and family is pretty damn important to them. 

With a 15 month old, I would avoid the El Rastro market on Sundays because it gets VERY crowded and you don't want your little one getting jostled around or trampled. The Reina Sofia has some exhibits that are a little intense for young kids (modern art, you know) but just pop in and see the majors (Dali, Picasso), it's worth it. And like Aevum said, free days! The Prado might be boring for your little one but it's great as well. There are also tons of playgrounds throughout the city, just walk around and you'll come across them in every other plaza. 

There are a lot of hostels with private rooms, especially around the Sol area, which is the center of everything. Check Hostelworld or Hostels.com, they usually have good deals. From Sol, you can walk to just about all of the attractions. Madrid is my favorite city for walking and it's free, opposed to the bus/metro. Madrid isn't as expensive as other cities, thankfully. You'll have a great time. Learn some Spanish before you go, I've met many people who don't speak English. That doesn't mean that no one does but you'll have an easier time if you know a bit.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"I've written about it at length down in this conversation, but purely as a hobby, I'll try to close on the subject from a different angle; Britain sees EU as an economic project - an extension of European Free Trade Area EFTA - while the rest of countries see this as a possibility to increase the weight of the continent as a whole and chance for integration on their own terms instead of on American terms. UK is very hard to grasp this, as they are more tied with USA (bonded by culture, legal system, language and contracts). And I don't mean this in the ""lol, 51st state rofl"" way either. They simply aren't endangered by many of the things that the rest of the Europe sees as threats. 

For example, American laws pushed to Europe are more easily incorporated in the UK due to the rest of the law and ""sense of right"" being already closer to it than in the rest of Europe. Similarly, when EU pushes directives to UK, the opposition is bigger because the cultural starting point is so different.

Because UK and USA share a language, UK doesn't understand why ""protecting local languages"" is such a big thing for many European countries or why everybody couldn't just use English as ""everybody speaks it anyway"" (a view many UK redditors wonder about here as well). 

Then there's the fact that the base assumptions for social contract are quite a big closer to each other in social democratic North, formerly Soviet East and largely socialist South compared to Britain, which is a constitutional monarchy and subjects only became citizens in 1981. Most of the legal framework is still based on the assumption that what isn't separately granted, is denied.  

Then there's the fact that island nations are always sheltered from cultural integration in a different way than landlocked countries. It's harder to take outside influence when the ""baselevel"" is zero.

All this leads to the fact that UK has a very different vision for Europe than the other countries - as well as ideas on what's good for UK.

You simply *need* to get you incomes in sync with your expenditures, period. One can argue if the current speed that is going on is right, though. You have also shown that you can't really handle it when you're simply given money.

All of you PIGS (southerners, whatever you wanna be called) have been building your current level of GDP on a binge of cheap credit and that is now gone and probably won't be coming back, ever. 

And as much as you want, as much as you cry and wail, we *can't* really replace that. You absolutely need to come down from what you're currently spending to halfway sustainable levels or you'll drag us all down with you.

Self-employed workers tend to work more than those who have specified hours in an employment contract. The second reason Mr Marianna points to is the different number of part-time workers in each country. ""In Germany, the share of employees working part-time is quite high. This represents something like one in four,"" he says. As these annual hours figures are for all workers, the large proportion who work part-time in Germany is bringing down the overall average. In Greece, far fewer people work part-time. So, because the two labour markets are structured differently, it is actually hard to compare like with like.

true,eberkut,EURO,European Union,"Competitiveness has become the main talking point of the right. They still lack credibility though since they seem to worship the German Haartz reforms now while they have been in power for ten years and did nothing even close. Plus they're in the middle of a fight for leadership so they don't have clear message (yet). Anyway they don't have any power left (they even lost the upper house of parliament last year for the first time).

The left is divided. Hollande has been elected on a clearly leftist platform but he's a centrist at heart. While he was still only one of several contenders for the Socialist Party candidacy, his main proposition was for a comprehensive sustainable fiscal reform which included shifting the tax burden in favor of work and productivity. He's not really talking about it anymore. He was elected with the backing of more leftist parties (Greens and the Front de Gauche, the latter being a local equivalent of Die Linke in Germany formed on the ashes of the Communist and some Socialist splinter group) and the Socialist Party itself included several major figures much more to the left than Hollande (some have become ministers). They all refuse to be nicer to corporation as they see them as the main cause of the dire situation France is in. For instance, when a large carmaker announced last summer that it would be closing a large factory, they blamed it on the boss and the shareholder family's bad strategy and certainly not on the high wages.

Still, Hollande has chosen some rather moderate and competent people for all the economy-related ministries so he may try to enforce part of his original program. He seems to be slowly moving toward increasing competitiveness with some measures similar to what Sarkozy tried to do close to the end of his mandate (with an increase on a social tax instead of the VAT to compensate a decrease in payroll taxes). The local Court of Auditor is headed by a former socialist and is clearly being used to push for such a reform under the guise of independant analysis. With the coming EU Fiscal Treaty, Hollande has no choice but to find a way to balance the budget. Taxes are already rather high. He can only increase them on the highest earners but it won't take him as far as he needs to and it might end up being counter-productive. He doesn't want to cut into public services nor welfare programs since it goes against everything the left believes in. His only option left is to stimulate growth. He's trying to inject money into the economy through a new public investment bank but again it won't be enough. So his only option left is indeed to increase competitiveness. He's pushing the unions to reach a consensus on this issue before the end of the year to avoid any social unrest but he clearly stated that the state would impose a reform if the unions fail.

It reminds me of the last major socialist in power (Jospin, prime minister between 1997 and 2002). He began by signing a EU treaty that he had promised to renegotiate without changing much and he ended up pursuing a much more right-wing economic policy than the right could ever get away with (he privatised more than any other government). At the time, one of Jospin main supporter was...

**STORY TIME**

.

Ho un'amica che una decina d'anni fa era andata in campeggio con la famiglia sul Gargano. 

Era il solito periodo estivo in cui i piromani danno il loro peggio. E dunque accade che il suo campeggio viene avvolto dalle fiamme nonostante i gestori, con l'incendio tutt'intorno, dicessero che non c'era pericolo per beni e persone. 

Nel frattempo però i lavoratori del campeggio accanto bagnavano la proprietà e i beni degli ospiti per scongiurare ogni rischio. 

Ma poi, manco a farlo apposta, i roghi superano il recinto del camping nel quale risiedeva, bruciando, assieme al camper e con esso tutti i suoi beni, il resto delle vetture parcheggiate. 

Lei si salva assieme alla famiglia buttandosi a mare mentre le fiamme lambivano la spiaggia.

Tralasciando la disorganizzazione dimostrata dai proprietari del suo campeggio in seguito al misfatto, passo al punto saliente: tornata a casa apre un blog in modo che i danneggiati avessero un luogo dove discutere del loro caso. 

A quel punto lei era piuttosto sicura che l'incendio fosse doloso - aveva il sospetto che i gestori del suo camping non avessero pagato il pizzo. 

E insomma, per farla breve: dopo qualche tempo che erano tornati a casa, un giorno il padre riceve una chiamata a casa: qualcuno, con fare minaccioso, consigliava alla figlia di chiudere il blog e dimenticare l'accaduto.

Lei, saputa la notizia, lo chiude senza farne più menzione.

IMO politics should be about ugly people making hard decisions

And having a fragmented army/foreign policy doesn't seem such a bad thing when history shows that the opposite tends to lead to misuse of power and straight out atrocities

Why? It's got much going against it.

The only long-term viable writing systems for Mandarin are all Latin-script based but require liberal use of diacriticals, which are difficult for both humans and machines.

The tonal nature of the sounds can be challenging for people who didn't grow up hearing it, so that's a generation or two of non-Chinese-speakers written off.

The vocabulary is small, the grammar is imprecise, and there's a very limited back catalog of useful scientific and other texts, so we'd need years and years of translation in order to catch up.

Why not just go with English? It's easy to type and to represent electronically; it's in much wider use (spread rather than absolute numbers); it can be as precise or imprecise as you like; it's got a comprehensive vocabulary; it's easier for people from a wider range of linguistic backgrounds to learn; it's got the greatest wealth of printed materials already available.",0,1348271478,null,0,false,0,c6bmr0o,t3_108uoa,t1_c6bmr0o,t1_c6bmb4y,null,1429958954,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

&gt; In the school year 2009/2010, the Rütli School was integrated into a new school, the 1. Gemeinschaftsschule, along with several classes from a nearby elementary school and a Realschule. Ninety percent of the students today are of a non-German background. The school is in a period of reform which includes the introduction of new school programs, building of new facilities, and renovation of classrooms.
The school has three gyms, a school kitchen, four PC rooms, an arts-studio, a chemistry lab, a physics lab, a wood and metal shop, and a music room. A museum informs visitors about the school's past.

This is what the German wiki says:
&gt; Ab dem Schuljahr 2009/2010 leitet Cordula Heckmann entsprechend einem Modellversuch des Senats, der pro Bezirk mindestens eine Gemeinschaftsschule vorsieht, die neugegründete „1. Gemeinschaftsschule“ Neukölln, zu der außer den Klassen der Jahrgänge 1, 2, 7 und 8 auch die Jahrgänge 3 bis 6 der ehemaligen Franz-Schubert-Schule (Grundschule) und die Jahrgänge 9 und 10 der ehemaligen Rütli-Schule (Hauptschule) und Heinrich-Heine-Schule (Realschule) gehören. Eine „Sekundarstufe II“ ist geplant. Die 1. Gemeinschaftsschule ist das Zentrum des Campus’ Rütli [9] und Schlüsselschule des Vorhabens „Ein Quadratkilometer Bildung“.[10]
Im letzten Schuljahr begann die erste Bauphase auf dem „Campus Rütli“, und die Gemeinschaftsschule erhielt eine Mensa, modernste naturwissenschaftliche Räume, neue Jahrgangslehrerzimmer und Sekretariatsräume. Neben Fachräumen für Chemie, Physik, Biologie, Musik und Bildende Kunst verfügt die Schule über eine Schulküche, eine Holz- und eine Metallwerkstatt, vier PC-Räume und zwei Turnhallen. Das Schulmuseum entstand in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Künstler Günter Evertz.
Im Schuljahr 2009/2010 gab es 17 Klassen. 90 % der Schülerinnen und Schüler waren nichtdeutscher Herkunft. In den Berliner Gemeinschaftsschulen soll die Zusammensetzung der Schülerschaft von der Einschulung bis zum Schulabschluss gleich bleiben. Das Ziel ist, dass alle Schülerinnen und Schüler unabhängig von der Empfehlung der Grundschule und von ihrer sozialen, kulturellen oder ethnischen Herkunft und vom Geschlecht, unabhängig von einer Religionszugehörigkeit und unabhängig von einer Behinderung gemeinsam mit- und voneinander lernen. Die Schwerpunkte der Unterrichtsgestaltung liegen im binnendifferenzierten, schülerzentrierten Umgang mit heterogenen Klassen und der individuellen Förderung. Das Motto ist: Eine Schule für alle! Kein Schüler bleibt zurück (Modellversuch).
Gemeinschaftsschulen sind Ganztagsschulen. Das bedeutet, dass an vier Tagen in der Woche der Schultag von 8 bis 16 Uhr dauert. Die Schülerinnen und Schüler haben die Chance, aus einem breiten Wahlpflichtangebot zu wählen, das vor allem am Nachmittag stattfindet. Daran schließt ein umfangreiches Nachhilfeprogramm zur Vorbereitung der Zehntklässler auf den Mittleren Schulabschluss in den Fächer Deutsch, Englisch und Mathematik an. Zusätzliche Vorbereitungskurse finden gegebenenfalls in den Schulferien als Feriencamps statt. Es gibt eine Mittagspause mit Speiseangeboten sowohl in der Mensa als auch in der Cafeteria. Daran schließt sich ein „Mittagsband“ mit einem vielfältigen Freizeit- und Lernangebot an.

I am all for the police being a deescalating force and am very critical for when there is a chance they were not, but in this case they had to be there because it was obvious what was going to happen. There is an increasingly more violent and larger group of people in the Netherlands that love these kind of things. 

The groups used to be confined to football hooligans, but they are expanding. They are more regularly meeting with each other just to have fights with each other, and provably plan their next event where they want to wreak havoc (informers in those groups report the plans and activities to the police).

It is a very serious problem, especially since these people also flock to accidents just to harass/violently attack the people that are trying to help injured people or maybe even dying people.

It has become so common, that it has become normal for the police to respond with greater urgency to an accident (where that normally is only important to collect evidence and ensure the safety of emergency responders in the on-going traffic), to make sure ambulance personnel and firemen can do their work and not get beaten so badly they need to go the hospital themselves.

Alcohol was a factor, but the most important factor were a fraction of people that hide in the masses and specifically go to places to fuck things up.

Obviously, you had different experiences with the police and I completely acknowledge that there are cases in which the police did not respond properly and only made sure violence came into play, but they are not always on the wrong end, and from what I can tell the police in the Netherlands has a good idea of how to deal with a situation.

From what I, for instance, have seen from the student riots in the UK, I do definitely think the police in those cases had a significant hand in instigating violence.

But recently here in the Netherlands, the worst problem with perceived excessive police violence was when a police agent kicked for apparently no good reason, but it turned out that handcuffing him had failed and he wildly flailed around with a handcuff attached to one wrist, which could cause severe head trauma or even death if you hit someone on the head with it.

Probably every other language? There's thousands of little nuances between small words which at first sight might seem the same. Here's a random French example i stumbled upon a few days ago:

&gt;**And how would you translate that ['casse-toi riche con!'] into English, exactly?**

&gt; It depends on who you ask. The Daily Mail opted for ""Go away, rich p****!"" The New Statesman rendered it ""Get lost, you rich bastard!"" Google Translate offers ""Fuck off, rich con!"", the untranslated word at the end being a vulgar reference to female genitalia for which there is no real equivalent in English.

true,StoneCall,SACH,Leipzig,"&gt; You have quite a high salary, and cheap private insurances may actually be cheaper than a ""Gesetzliche"" since the monthly fee of a ""Gesetzliche"" is made up from about 15% (don't know excact numbers) of your monthly salary (actually not sure wether before or after taxes)

15.5% of everything below 3825€/month before taxes. 7.3% is paid by the employer, 8.2% by the employee. So he'd pay 313.65€ in the Gesetzliche, while his employer pays 279.22€ - total cost: 592.87€. 

If he chooses a Private, the ratio of employer/employee payment is the same, but the employer never pays more than he would in the Gesetzliche. So if his premium is above 592.87€, the employer will pay what he would pay with the Gesetzliche, and OP has to make up the difference.

A Private might still be cheaper, but this can reverse quickly when OP gets older and his girlfriend becomes his stay-at-home wife with children - in the Gesetzliche, they're automatically included, in the Private they're not, and generally you can't go from the Private to the Gesetzliche.",0,1348313899,null,0,false,0,c6bsnhf,t3_10ajc2,t1_c6bsnhf,t1_c6bskai,null,1429961800,7,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,7

Probably not really in the medical treatment (I´m sure the docs do their best for everybody), but the whole other stuff. They´ll just earn more money with you and so are more interested to have you as a patient. You´ll feel that. For example (Again, personel experience and i´m not a fan of it). You will always get an appointment immediately. It´s like ""I have yada yada pain - Well, visit us on monday in two weeks - Did i mentioned that i´m insured private? - Oh, just come in today, the doc will wait for you."" Or if i go to the doc without an appointment, there is often a full anteroom with sick person waiting, but the nurse calls my name first... And yes, some docs exclusively take private insured people. Not officialy, but they do. You mentioned the luxury like a separate room. Yes, thats inclusive. Also the chief physican... The important part for me is, that you not just get the basic treatment, but the good stuff. For example, i lost my front teeth in an accident and got some fancy dentures which cost about 3000€ each and look exactly like the original. I doubt that the Gesetzliche would pay for that. Of course you would get dentures, but you would probably see that they are fake. Some Private even pay for Lasik... The problem about this, is that they sometimes do unnecessary treatments, because they´ll earn money. But i can live with that. Summarized, if you can pay the private, get it. The system is not perfect and not really fair, but thats my experience about it. I hope this helps.

Déjà à l'intérieur du catholicisme (la variante de christianisme que je connais le mieux), il y a tellement de courants de pensée (appelés ordres, par exemple les Jésuites, les Dominicains ...) que personne ne peut dire ""les cathos pensent que l'avortement devrait être interdit"".""

Par contre, chacune de ces 'écoles' a historiquement cherché à dominer les autres pour imposer sa façon de voir les choses. Ce n'est pas parce qu'ils ne sont pas d'accord entre eux qu'ils ont une morale questionnable et qui cherche à évoluer. Ce sont des interprétations du même vieux livre. 

Enfin, une religion qui est passée à travers les lumières et le sécularisme (non sans lutter contre chaque étape) n'est effectivement pas ce qu'il y a de pire. Les vérités absolues et infaillibles défendues par chaque branche du catholicisme ont dû s'adapter et se modifier avec l'évolution de la société, faute de quoi cette religion aurait disparu, de toutes façons. Quand le tissu anthropologique sur lequel une religion se greffe change, celle-ci est condamnée à s'adapter ou à perdre des fidèles.

""des valeurs face à l'absence d'alternative crédible et durable.""

Si c'est la seule bonne raison de conserver une religion, je propose de remplacer la bible par une anthologie de nos textes les plus sages (on peut garder le sermon de la montagne) et l'église catholique par un conseil de scientifiques et philosophes. Parce que l'alternative ""durable"" qui a attendu l'effondrement du fascisme pour se ranger du côté des démocraties et minauder que tout c'qui compte c'est l'amour du prochain, c'est pas ce que je trouve de plus crédible. Les humanistes sont plus constants, à ce jeu-là. 

""Je la connais bien, et c'est bien plus compliqué que ""la religion et la tyrannie c'est pareil et c'est pas bien"". D'abord, les massacres de religion ne représentent qu'une infime partie des morts dans le monde. Ensuite, attribuer des morts à une religion, c'est compliqué.

Finalement, la source principale de conflits dans le monde depuis la seconde guerre mondiale, ce sont les ressources naturelles. C'est indiscutable et évident, je te laisse chercher.""

C'est pour ça que j'ai dit que c'était l'origine *ou* le catalyseur. Evidemment que lorsque quelqu'un ayant du pouvoir veut déclencher une guerre, il est plus intéressé par les bénéfices et les ressources que par une quelconque idéologie, mais à partir de là, comment font-il pour ranger une partie conséquente de la population derrière eux ? Il y a quasiment toujours une composante religieuse importante. C'est rarement la raison première d'un conflit, mais c'est un outil très efficace de manipulation de masses. 

Pour le côté 'la religion et la tyrannie c'est pareil et c'est pas bien', je ne faisais pas référence à l'alliance du vatican et de la montée du fascisme au XX° siècle, plutôt à nos guerres de religions. Quant au fait que ce soit la même chose que la tyrannie, oui, il est tout à fait défendable qu'essayer de persuader autrui qu'il y a 1) quelqu'un qui sait ce que tu penses 2) qui peut te donner une punition pire que la mort si tu ne penses ou agis pas comme il faut 3) et je sais comment il veut que tu te comportes, c'est essayer de faire vivre ladite personne dans un système qu'elle croit totalitaire pour pouvoir la manipuler. Quand on sait pertinemment qu'un adulte n'y croira pas, et donc qu'on indoctrine volontairement les enfants, je ne crois pas que la phrase suivante soit exagérée :

""La pire saloperie jamais inventée par notre espèce, un virus idéologique dont la fonction première est de se perpétuer en empêchant le développement de ce qui le combat efficacement : la séparation des églises et de l'Etat, la liberté d'expression, le rationalisme, l'éducation pour tous.""

Si je devais corriger ça, se serait ""une"" des pires saloperies inventées par l'humanité. Quand je parle d'un virus (idéologique), c'est évidemment une image, car les religions se comportent effectivement comme des virus en cela qu'elles ont de nombreuses caractéristiques visant uniquement à ce qu'elles se perpétuent. Si tu connais aussi bien l'histoire que tu le dis, tu devrais savoir que toutes les religions (allez, toutes les principales) ont combattu, physiquement ou idéologiquement, ce que j'ai cité, même celles qui ont fini par accepter de guerre lasse. 

Edit : et on oublie le plus important. Les cosmologies et les évènements défendus par les religions sont quasi-certainement faux. Ne devrait-ce pas être un argument de poids ?
Edit2 : les pères fondateurs des USA étaient majoritairement déistes, et de qui tu parles pour ceux de l'Europe ?

La question du mondialisme (l'idée que la mondialisation est une bonne chose et qu'il faut l'encourager ? C'est ainsi que je le comprends) est trop vaste, et je pense personnellement que la mondialisation se fait avec ou sans volonté mondialiste, donc neutre pour ma part. Si tu veux arguer du fait que la mondialisation est une mauvaise chose, ok, pourquoi pas - c'est tellement vaste que même si j'en ai une représentation assez positive, je n'ai aucun moyen d'en être certain. Je pense juste que lutter contre ne fonctionnera pas et rendra le processus plus douloureux.

Das heißt also wenn ich dich Frage wie viele Jahre daueren 10 Lichtjare dann musst du sagen: ""Das kann man nicht ausrechnen? Weil es gibt keine umrechnungsmöglichkeit."" :)

Ja, das will ich dir sagen: es gibt keinen festen Umrechnungskoeffizienten zwischen Jahren und Lichtjahren. Natürlich besteht eine physikalische Beziehung zwischen Strecke und Zeit, die nennt sich Geschwindigkeit: v = s/t. Aber die Lichtgeschwindigkeit c ist nur einer von unendlich vielen Werten, die sich für v einsetzen lassen. 

Und dein letztes Beispiel zeigt es: MEIN Vergleich hinkte nämlich nicht, denn er war das exakte Äquivalent zu dem, was du behauptet hast. Wenn du eine Geschwindigkeit hast, kannst du natürlich von einer Strecke in eine Zeit umrechnen, das heißt aber nicht, dass Strecke und Zeit äquivalent sind!

Ich würde also nicht antworten ""Das kann man nicht ausrechnen, weil es keine Umrechnungsmöglichkeit gibt"", sondern ich würde antworten ""Lichtjahre dauern nicht, denn Lichtjahre sind eine Längeneinheit. Oder wie lange dauert deiner Meinung nach ein Meter? Wenn sich etwas mit einer konstanten Geschwindigkeit v bewegt, dann braucht es eine Zeit t von t = 1 Lichtjahr / v um 1 Lichtjahr zurückzulegen. Wenn es sich dabei z.B. um ein Photon handelt, so ist t = 1 Jahr.""

This is wrong. You only have to pay stuff like the general practitioner and meds, and then you can make a choice whether you pass the cost onto the insurance company or if you reap any possible benefits. (Axa for example pays me back 2 months, iirc, if I don't have any costs for a year.)

Hospital automatically charge the insurance companies. People don't have that kind of money under their mattresses.  

Also, money that you pay when you're younger will go towards later payments. So you pay more when you're younger (still way less than the gesetzliche) than you should.

Where it does apparently get costly is if you add spouses and kids in the mix. This is something OP should check out before.

For the money I pay for mine I wouldn't want to change from my privater insurance.

Aber ich freu mich schon auf das erste Schild an der Autobahn, das die erlaubte Höchstgeschwindigkeit in 0.000000112c angibt. ;)

&gt;Also wenn du v=s/t hast und als strecke 1 Lichtjahr einsetzt dann MUSST du die Lichtgeschwindigkeit ins spiel bringen weil du sonst kein Informationsgewinn hast. v=1Lichtjahr/1Jahr bringt dir garnichts.

Nein, das hat mit dem Lichtjahr gar nichts zu tun. Ein Lichtjahr lässt sich durch einen festen Umrechnungskoeffizienten (da hast du ihn! ;)) in Meter umrechnen. Um *ganz* genau zu sein, brauchst du die Lichtgeschwindigkeit um zu wissen, wie lang ein Meter ist. Das war z.B. nicht immer so und ist eine Frage der Definition. Heute wird der Meter tatsächlich über die Lichtgeschwindigkeit definiert (ein Meter ist genau die Strecke, die das Licht in 1/299792458 Sekunde zurücklegt). Das war früher aber beispielsweise anders: früher wurde der Meter über das sogenannte Urmeter definiert, das war eine Metallstange, deren Länge als 1 Meter definiert wurde. 

&gt;Wenn du auf die Straße gehst und fragst wie lange dauert 1 Lichtjahr...dann wirst du nur selten hören das kommt auf die Geschwindigkeit an. 

Das liegt aber nicht daran, dass das richtig wäre, sondern daran, dass die meisten Menschen leider keine Ahnung von Physik haben.

Du hast natürlich Recht, wenn du sagst, dass die meisten Leute sich an dieser Bezeichnung nicht stören werden, bzw. gar nicht wissen werden, dass sie falsch ist. Aber wie schon gesagt, das liegt nicht daran, dass es deswegen richtiger sei. In der Physik hat das Lichtjahr eine ganz klar definierte Bedeutung, und daran lässt sich auch nicht heruminterpretieren. Und gerade das Deutsche Museum, das doch zur Aufgabe hat, die allgemeine Bevölkerung mit Wissen über Naturwissenschaften zu versorgen, sie erfahrbar und verständlich zu machen, sollte solch einen Fehler nun wirklich nicht machen und damit das falsche Verständnis des Begriffs ""Lichtjahr"" in der Bevölkerung noch unterstützen. 

EDIT: Ich bin wahrscheinlich in der Hinsicht ein bisschen kleinkarierter als der Durchschnittsbürger, immerhin bin ich Physikstudentin und arbeite mit solchen Größen jeden Tag. Da stört es einen vermutlich noch mehr, wenn solche Begriffe falsch verwendet werden, gerade von Leuten, die Ahnung haben sollten.

**Serbian prime minister: Splitting the Kosovo is the only solution**

**Cacic: ""Everything is acceptable as long it means no recognition of independence""**

Belgrade - The Serbian prime minister Ivica Dacic has spoken out for a split of the Kosovo. He told the Belgrade based TV station ""Prink"" on Friday, that he thinks that a separation of the Kosovo is the only possible and realistic solution of the conflict. The social politician also said, that he is sure that the Kosovo-Albanians in Pristina (Prishtina) would accept that solution. But protests in the region could emerge. In the current phase ""everything is acceptable as long it means no recognition of the unilateral stated independence of Kosovo"", he adds.

Belgrade is remaining to consider the Kosovo, which stated its independence in 2008, as a Serbian province. The mostly Serbian populated North Kosovo still detracts itself from the regulation power of Pristina. For years, talks about the splitting of Kosovo have been conducted in quit in Belgrade, but until now no official of Serbia has openly spoken out for it. Dacic has pleaded for the separation a year earlier. At that time he was interior minister.

Exactly, less growth with fewer people is not a problem. If you have a 1% decrease in GDP and 1% decrease in people you would have the same GDP per capita, which is what actually counts for people's well-being. China has huge GDP but low GDP per capita, and most Chinese aren't living that well.

The only reason we ""need"" more children is a decreasing workforce. Less people are the only possible solution to other world problems, especially the ecological ones.

Ah, one other trick: Not sure what sector you'll be working in but, if possible, try to make sure the job title that appears in your contract is something geared towards foreigners (e.g. I'm a project manager/translator but my contract says ""English-speaking translator"" because it goes down better at the Préfecture).

request.
3. I applied for a visa salarié from the get-go. Had to go back to the US for three months while it was being processed. I've heard of people successfully changing from student to salarié. It can be done, but there can be some administrative headwinds. My company had to hire a lawyer to keep one American on the payroll. 

It makes some sense to start out as an intern (as long as you aren't on an intern's salary!), because you're not limited to the 20 hours per week allowed on a student visa. But I'm not sure about the timing of the whole thing (when you would need to apply for a CDI in order to keep your visa, etc.)

The government websites are really opaque and it's difficult to get straight answers. There are lots of associations that specialize in immigration law and have juristes who can help you figure everything out. Or go down to the Préfecture de Police on Avenue du Maine.

I finished engineering school in August 2010, went back home for a couple of weeks to visit family then came back to France to look for a job. My titre de sejour (etudiant) was due to end in November that same year, which pretty much left me a couple of month to find a job.

I got lucky, I guess, I signed for a CDI early October, and I wasn't supposed to start working until the beginning of November. As soon as I got my copy of the contract, I headed to the ""Prefecture de Police"" to ask for a ""changement de statut: etudiant -&gt; salarie"".

It took 6 months to get the new titre de sejour (salarie this time). In the meantime:

 - I was able to work, since they delivered a document (I don't remember the exact name, but something like Contrat de Travail)

 - I was able to travel with a Recepisse, a temp replacement for the titre de sejour I had to renew every 3 months.

There's also something called Autorisation Pour le Travail (or something like that) they deliver to students looking for a job and on the verge of expiring their titre de sejour. You should apply to it a few months before expiration (now?). It basically give you 6 more months to look for a job. I never had it, but I have friends who got it.

IMO Reddit's not the best place to look for info, as requirements change fairly often. The big lines remain the same, but some requirements may change (I've heard different stories from different people). The best way to get info is to go to the prefecture (at the metro stop Cite on line 4, next to Chatelet) and ask. Don't call them, you'll get a vocal server that'll tell you to go on the (horrendous) website. If you're ""lucky"" you may get to a human operator who has very little clue of what you should actually do. Believe me, go there. Before 4pm.

Finally, I'll say that taking this internship and turning it into a CDI is by far your best bet for everything going smoothly for your paperwork. (It's really important that you have a CDI before asking for the titre de sejour salarie, and some employers won't hire you if you don't have it. It's a fucked up process, I know). The only risk you're taking is that your employer isn't impressed by your work as an intern and decide not to give you the CDI. French labor law gives a lot of leverage to the employee (a lot more than the US), so employers are really careful before handing out CDIs. If you do decide to take that internship, work your ass off for the first months, just to be sure you'll get the contract.

true,kennon42,null,null,"To sum up the pros and contras in the thread as well as my own experience:

Pros ""gesetzliche Krankenversicherung"":

* Is based on your income, so when you are older/retired and not making much money/lose your job, you will pay much less
* Family included for no extra cost, including lots and lots of preventative care/learning course type things for kids (it's really great)
* Don't have to pay upfront
* Supposedly ""benefits society""

Cons:

* Is based on your income, when your income is high you will pay a lot more
* 10 EUR/quarter fee if you use any services (woohoo)
* Can potentially wait weeks/months for non-emergency care. Will definitely wait hour+ for most doctor visits unless you go at the right time and/or are lucky.

Pros ""private Krankenversicherung"":

* Is not based on your income - you pay flat monthly fee depending on health/age/policy. For data point, as a healthy 33 year old male I pay 216 EUR/mo (since I'm self-employed this is 100% of my policy price)
* You will almost always go to the head of the waiting line. I almost feel uncomfortable at the doctor since I almost always get called first, even if there is a full room of patients waiting.
* If you don't use any medical services in a year, you can get a sharp rebate on your policy. A couple of years ago I didn't submit any medical costs for the year and got the equivalent of 2 months back. This stacks, so if you go a few years without submitting costs you can get a really steep rebate. It sometimes makes sense, if you can afford it, to hold onto your medical costs for the year and then see if it's worth submitting them versus the potential rebate.
* You have control over your own ""destiny"" - you can choose specifically which policy you want with which options and calculate a price. You're not stuck to a ""one size fits all"" plan/cost (although to be fair there are some subtle differences between the gesetzliche Krankenkassen with respect to which extra services they offer so you do have some choice there too)

Cons:

* Is not based on your income, so even if you start earning way less or get older or retire, your policy will slowly get more expensive.
* You do have to pay non-emergency medical costs up front, although these get sent as an invoice up to a month after the service and you can submit them to your insurance company immediately and they will reimburse. It's usually taken around 3-4 weeks for me to get the money, so you basically only have to float the costs for a few weeks.
* Doctors will nickel and dime you for every possible ridiculous thing. While you do get this reimbursed, it ticks me off to see the things doctors charge private patients for. For instance: a doctor called me a week after a visit and said, pretty much verbatim: ""Guten Tag! Ihre Ergebnisse sind da. Sie können sie jederzeit abholen. Danke, tschüß!"" ... and on the invoice this was listed as a 15 EUR ""telefonische Beratung"".
* If you are older than a certain age (not sure what this is) the GKVs won't let you switch, so you might be stuck.

I'm currently privately insured but will probably switch to public at some point before I hit the age threshold (I have an insurance broker who has taken care of the ins and outs for me).

&gt; Binge drinking more common in northern Europe

&gt; The relationship between drinking and damage to one's health is stronger in the Baltic countries and Sweden than in Italy, new research from Europe shows. The findings, published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical &amp; Experimental Research, suggest that the northern part of Europe tends to report higher alcohol-harm relationships because of a stronger propensity to indulge in heavy episodic drinking, what experts label 'binge drinking'.

&gt; Binge drinking on the rise amongst Dutch teens

&gt; ""Pear liqueur, a can of beer, some whisky and then some wine."" The number of children in the Netherlands hospitalised with alcohol poisoning has increased by almost 50 percent in the space of a year. Paediatricians treated around 500 children for ""serious alcohol-related incidents"" in 2009, double the number treated in 2008.

&gt; More Dutch kids binge drinking

&gt; The number of young binge drinkers increased again last year, according to figures released by the observation centre of the Netherlands Paediatric Association.

&gt; 762 young people were admitted to hospital with acute alcohol poisoning in 2011, compared to 684 in 2010 and 297 the year before that. The victims were also unconscious for longer periods – around 3½ hours on average.

The Irish Green Party has elected representatives at at least council level on both sides of the border.

Then there are the small left wing parties such as the Socialist Party, People Before Profit Alliance and the Communist Party of Ireland which are all registered on both sides of the border.

The Irish Labour party stays out of Northern Ireland but that is so it doesn't split the vote for the SDLP which it actively supports.

Essentially on the nationalist side there is a lot of cross border organisation. For obvious reasons the Unionist parties don't extend into the South.

But as you said there would be an issue in convincing people on the idea of reunification due to the stereotypes of Sinn Féin.

Es gibt zum Beispiel sehr hohe Alkohol Steuern, ist zwar nicht komplett verboten wie in anderen islamistischen Ländern aber trotzdem nicht so einfach zu bekommen. Davon abgesehen gibt es sehr viele Moscheen die wenn ich mich nicht täusche 5 mal am Tag beten. Die Gebete der Moslems sind etwas anderes, da steigt jemand auf einen Turm und schreit durch die Lautsprecher. Ich war damals von 3 Moscheen umzingelnd. Es gibt auch sehr viele Religiöse Länder die so gut wie alle Sexuellen Themen und Anspielungen zensieren. In Rush Hour wurde zum Beispiel die Szene entfernt in der James Carter seine Kollegin nach ihrer Unterwäsche fragte.

Deswegen würde ich sagen das die Türkei sehr religiös ist, man wird halt von der Religion sehr beeinflusst. Andererseits haben die auch sehr wilde Parties... 

In der Türkei werden die Menschen halt sehr schnell verhaftet. Persönlich kenne ich jetzt keinen, ich habe aber auf /r/turkey gelesen das viele protestierenden Studenten verhaftet wurden und den Familien nicht gesagt wurde wie lange die dort bleiben müssen.

Außerdem, es gibt halt überall Kameras und Kontrollen. In der Türkei gibt es ja inzwischen auch ""Media Markt"" und ""Real"" und wenn man zum Beispiel dort einkaufen möchte dann muss man sich erst von Polizisten kontrollieren lassen, wie beim Flughafen. 

Deswegen glaube ich das dort nicht viel passieren wird. Mir fällt gerade ein das in diesem August oder im September eine berühmte Person entführt, ich bin mir nicht sicher aber ich glaube das es ein Politiker war. Dieser wurde aber überraschenderweise sofort wieder frei gelassen weswegen ich das nicht so wirklich glauben möchte.

Depends how you look at it really. Case of Srpska Krajina, can prove the point that in Balkans only when territories are ethnically clean there can be peace. In this case, it was Serbs who were expelled and some Croats from Vojvodina transferred to Croatia, and yeah, it is a possible scenario for Kosovo Serbs too. It is projected that 100 000 Kosovo Serbs are already permanently removed from their home places. I don't say that is a good thing, of course, and it doesn't send a good example, but for Croatia it worked perfectly. They have Serb treat no more.

When I say that I mean, it's primarily just a couple of demographics and not a ubiquitous movement all over. While there was protest over universities about 4 years ago, I don't remember any extreme violence. The violence I believe that YOU are referring to is done by impoverished citizens and or immigrants...often in tough urban areas like the Northern parts of Paris and beyond. They are rioting because of injustices done unto them...religion often plays a role (but not always) lots of these  'youths' are Muslims. I'm not saying that because I'm racist, I just know the large majority of the North African immigrant community and general African community as well are Islamic. They often wear traditional clothing from their culture and a few years ago Sarko stirred up some dust when it came to banning burkas, crosses, stars of david, etc. in schools/certain public places. This group of people are often targets of hate crimes...so whenever that takes place, there's usually hell to pay. I'm not sure if you remember the incident a while back where one young guy was electrocuted while being chased by a cop. He died as he hit the electric fence. While the cop didn't inflict the injury and the whole reason there was a chase was a bit ambiguous, the community still had an uproar about it blaming the death on the cop, and by extension French Government. I've been to France 7 times, and I lived in Paris for three months in summer '11. I learned a lot of different sides to that city than they'd 'advertise.' I'm by no means an expert, but I've see the tensions first-hand. I didn't see torchings, but I could still sense the cultural divide and how some Parisians perceived them as being inferior. So in answer to your question, I don't fully know. The best I can say is that is an angry desperate cry for help. They want the attention achieved from doing something so violent and dramatic.
