&gt; Robolis: A controlled devaluation of the euro.




Let’s put it bluntly: devaluation is theft. When a country borrows too much and then marks down its currency it is stealing from its savers and the trading partners who were naïve enough to think the currency was a trustworthy store of value. So calls for the eurozone or anyone else to devalue rather than live within their means are simply enabling the breaking of what should be seen as a serious promise.

Devaluing the euro will absolutely smooth the integration process — for about two weeks, until the US, Japan, China, Brazil and all the other trading nations that are hurt by a falling euro retaliate with devaluations of their own. Then we’re in Jim Rickards’ Currency War III (the first two happened during the Depression and in the 1970s), complete with rising volatility in prices, interest rates and pretty much everything else.

One of the guaranteed results of a currency war commencing with today’s stratospheric debt levels and systemic fragility will be capital controls of a variety and scale never before seen. Each combatant will try to trap its citizens’ wealth at home in order to confiscate it through inflation, taxation or direct expropriation. - *John Rubino*

true,[deleted],null,null,"Mm. I can't go into great detail, but here are the answers as far as I am able to supply:

The latests protests are in opposition to austerity cuts. There is a lot of animosity towards the current administration.

Its difficult to say if there will be a schedule per say. Because of the frequency with which these protests have been taking place, it is probably just a daily activity. However, the organizers of such protests are pretty good at handing out pamphlets when they want to get a big turnout (like having 100,000 people show up in Sol). Its possible to get pamphlets like this during the morning on weekdays. This is typically rush hour and the organizers hand out packets of information, dates and times to working Spaniards. These hand outs can be found in metro stations. (i dont know if these are currently being made/handed out)

These protests seem to be a bit more dangerous that normal. Typically the protests don't escalate so rapidly, and you usually have an opportunity to gauge both the crowd and the police. You could be fine if you stay on the periphery, stay aware, and don't antagonize the police. Also, be advised: if traveling with a group, be sure to plan a meet up point and time, as cell service rarely works when 100,000 people are in such a small area, and its nearly impossible to navigate crowds like that.

Unfortunately they don't seem to have a very constructive message at this point. They are emphasizing that they do not want to progress with the austerity cuts, and they believe the current administration has ruined the country. As far as I have heard, however..they have no solution.

From what I've read, there are far more Roma who are part of mainstream society than there are Roma who live according to the Roma culture; the assimilated Roma aren't the people who everyone's complaining about.

Pour la FAQ, elle t'en apprendra bien plus que moi sur le sujet (je tutoie, en raison des échanges, par sympathie, tu le dis si ça te gène !). La question n'est pas tant ""est-ce que la demande est infinie"". Mais qu'est-ce que la demande ?
Imaginons un monde ""idéal"" où tous nos besoins matériels sont comblés. Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ? Penses-tu vraiment que tu entreras dans une phase de béatitude éclairée et que tu ne voudras plus rien ? Ah. Depuis quelques décennies, j'ai l'impression que la demande industrielle comme de produits dématérialisés ou culturels est entretenue.

A lire, si ça te tente :
- La Société de Consommation (Baudrillard),
- tout ce que tu peux de Galbraith. A fond. Le Nouvel Etat Industriel, pour commencer.

Au sujet des grandes écoles, c'est bien entendu subjectif. 
Je disais cela de l'ENA car cette école reste tout de même la première machine à fournir nos dirigeants français. L'ENS et l'X représentent le top du top, tout de même, aussi. La différence, c'est qu'elles misent sur une excellence d'apprentissage après une excellence de sélection. L'ENA produit explicitement des dirigeants de haut niveau, sans nuance. On peut faire prof de lycée en sortant de l'ENS. On peut ne pas devenir un grand chef d'entreprise dirigée par l'Etat en sortant de l'X. Mais l'ENA ne sert uniquement qu'à produire des managers (même si ce mot en fait vomir) de haut niveau. C'est la seule école dont l'UNIQUE finalité (et j'insiste sur le UNIQUE) est d'apprendre à diriger et dont la valeur est proportionnelle à la façon dont elle se ferme.

Montebourg est loin d'être anticapitaliste/antilibéral. Il est juste attaché à une certaine vision de l'Etat-qui-peut-tout-faire, et veut le beurre, l'argent du beurre et les fesses de la crémière. Son idéologie n'a aucune cohérence en-dehors d'une sorte de leitmotiv bêlé : ""faut gââââârder des emplois en Fraaaaance"", sans aucun fond théorique unifié ou une façon d'agir réellement. C'est Sarkozy à Industrieland. Il va falloir le brancher sur une dynamo ; on aurait plus besoin de tous ces foutus réacteurs nuquléaires (nu-qu-laires) après ça.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The Engineering degree has been created with the intention to create a adequate replacement for the old engineering degrees. The idea was to build on the reputation of the german Dipl. Ing. and to distinct between normal scientific and engineering degrees. If I remember correctly, it were mostly the Technical Universities (TU) and the FH, which pushed on this possibility. I studied business informatics, which used to be a Dipl. Ing. (FH) course, was discussed to be converted into a of-Enineering course, but ended being changed into a of-Science course. This happened because the of-Engineerings are, as you correctly mentioned, relatively rare and not used by the majority of universities.

Of course the name implies a difference. But if you compare the corresponding courses, you will notice that the typical of-Engineering subjectsare often offered as of-Science courses. It is even worse, because things like business administration are offered as of-Science or of-Art studies, often at the discretion of the university. It was rumored to be about the academic rumor, especially in math/or, but this is untrue. In the end it is a good idea to look at the modules offered, which give a hint on the direction of the course.

It used to be that way, but things at the Hochschulen have shifted from a mere school-like institution to one which also is involved in research. In the end as a student you are taught to work scientificly in both kinds of universities.

Yes, that is the exact reason why of-Engineering degrees are not that popular: They are somewhat outside the borders of the well known kinds of degrees. Plus the relationship between the Universities and the Univiersities of Applied Sciences invloves a lot of rivalry and politics - escpecially from the side of the Universities, who perceive the Hochschulen as a real danger to their idea of education.

Finally just make some Onions (mix them with some flour, so they get crispy) and put them in a frying pan with lots of oil/butter. Before they are to brown pull them out (they get darker afterwards). Then in the same pan put your mushrooms for a few minutes and then put them to the sauce.

There's been an escalation in the protests of some sectors.  The miners have given security forces a bad time.  People are just at the end of their rope with the prepotence of the Spanish cleptocracy. 

&gt; Is there a schedule, so I as a visitor can plan ahead to stay out of your way?

Check on the Democracia Real Ya Facebook page.  Also meneame.net often posts info about upcoming protests. 

&gt; Is it safe to be out amongst the crowds or is there a threat of violence?

I wouldn't expect violence from the crowds.  In fact, in has almost always the police who have started hostilities.  I would strongly advise you to not make the mistake some tourists have made and assume that they'll be safer if close to people in uniform.  STAY AWAY FROM RIOT POLICE!

Also, police have viciously attacked photographers and people sporting recording devices.  If you don't want trouble, don't sport any professional looking camera.  You may want to risk documenting what happens around you, but be conscious you increase the chance of having police coming at you.  I kid you not. 

&gt; What do the protesters hope to accomplish? Are they trying to get the conservative government recalled? Are they trying to get the current politicians to revoke their bad decisions? Are they forming a third party?

They are not trying to get the government recalled, though there's already talk it may not survive the whole term. It's more like a demand that the corrupt political and financial system share in the load of the crisis, and for judicial accountability.

* If you'd like to see expensive cars and an old-style vacancy place, go to [Deauville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deauville), and have a drink on terrasse, and go to the Casino.
* On the road to Dinard, there is a fantastic museum in Bayeux, that presents the so-called [tapisserie de Bayeux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayeux_Tapestry).  
* Also, I would recommand you to avoid all the WWII stuffs in Normandy. I personally found those very boring. The only exception is the [mémorial de Caen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9morial_de_Caen).  If you want to know more about the battle of Normandy, visit this place and forget about the others.
* When you'll get to Dinard, don't forget to go to the old city of Saint Malo and the Mont Saint Michel. These are classics, but they must be visited if you are around there.
* There is another fantastic and amazing museum in Avranches that presents the [Manuscripts du mont saint michel](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Scriptorial,_mus%C3%A9e_des_manuscrits_du_Mont-Saint-Michel), which are 800yo books written by monks, plus the history of the Normandy.
* There are also lots of small places that are only known by locals, and that you'll not found in any tourist guide.  I would recomand you to spend a half day in this one : [l'autre café](http://www.larochequiboit.fr/), nicknamed ""café de la roche qui boit"" by locals. Print the map if you want to get there, because its a bit lost despite being only 15 minutes away from the A84 autoroute.  
* If you like beautifull places in sea-front, you can take the boat from Granville to the [Chausey Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chausey), and spend 1 day there. 
* You'll get amazing souvenirs by doing the [traversée du mont saint michel](http://www.decouvertebaie.com/), which is a long walk from the bec d'andaine to the mont saint michel.  Don't try it by yourself because it can be dangerous, there are guides at the bec d'Andaine that will help you for the ""traversée"".

hm! well, thx for an interesting conversation. You might be right. I'm not sure that's the case, I think there is some asymmetry re what various nations would get from a higher inflation, and I think Germany in specific is against this and well suited by the lower levels as they currently have. Printing money in this case would I presume mean, ECB basically becoming a bad bank of europe, buying up greek, spanish and troubled bank bonds.

Won't investigate further on this though, due to lack of time, but thx for a stimulating exchange.

&gt; What I will think that is going to happen is that there will be more and more places where the ESM needs to put money, and as more and more money is used, the less there is in the instrument, and the more nervous the markets will be leading to ever increasing circle of death.

I think a large part of why the markets can cause such a contagion and the root source of nervousness, apart from admittedly quite limited size of the ESM, and it not being leveraged, is the fact they can pick out a country in trouble and push it beyond sustainability by driving up its lending costs. 

If europe could come up with an eurobond system that wouldn't imply a moral hazard for the largest debtors and wouldn't be more expensive to Germany (due to a higher liquidity poll), this would simply be impossible. It's the 'nuclear option' for this crisis, but I think it has gone on long enough with markets being no more predictable, that it's time for the nukes.

A review I read of ""Was nicht paßt, wird passend gemacht"" complimented Peter Thorwart's ability to go beyond the humor of the Ruhr, and appeal to a general German-speaking audience. I could see what they meant -- the plot wouldn't feel at home in Bavaria or Berlin.

Looking back, I'm still surprised that ""Der Schuh des Manitu"" was such a big hit in all of Germany... of course it was a much bigger hit in Bavaria and Austria. I thought Bully-Parade was a great show, too.

On one hand, I'm tempted to believe that, because this view is expressed quite often by a great number of people, and also because of many failed programs that were designed to help the Roma. On the other hand, it's extremely difficult for me to believe that there is such a sizable group of people that willingly live in such poverty. They are not just poor people who can't afford cable TV or a monthly bus pass, these are poor people who don't even have potable water, live in mud, and have spider bites all over them.   

I think people have a natural instinct to gain material wealth, at least to try and preserve their survival. Especially in the vicinity of highly materialist societies, like those in Europe. And stealing isn't enough, obviously. For me to believe that the Roma willingly live on the edge of survival, I'd have to believe that they regard themselves at the same level as cockroaches.

But what is happening right now is an even greater injustice: Social programmes are slashed, wages are lowered, public services are diminished. Did the poor and the working class create the crisis? No, they didn't, but still they are paying for it. 

If I had to choose between prudent investors and trading partners and the poor, I would gladly choose the former group to pay for the crisis. So, your implicit defending of the current situation to prevent an injustice is defending an even greater injustice. 

What needs to be done is that we have to revise our economic system. The crisis was caused by over-accumulation of capital that no one had a good place to invest. Our model has serious issues.

Member states are to blame for always blaming the EU institutions for their own shortcomings. They made people wary of more federalism and refused to transfer more sovereignty. That's actually what the German constitutional court has been bitching about since 2005: you must provide greater democratic control (and thus sovereignty transfers) if you want deeper integration.

My appointment was 8:30, which is the first of the day, so when I arrived at the OFII office, there was a huuuge line starting at the door and snaking around the building. I was sure that we would be in the line for hours. As it turned out, the people at the OFII are really efficient (most likely because they do this non-stop five days a week), so within 10 minutes of opening everyone was in the building and being sorted based on what they were there for. A security guard does a cursory check of bags at the door, and then I was ushered upstairs and told to give my invitation-thingy (the document that tells you when your appointment is) to a receptionist, who in turn told me to sit and wait. I would hear that many times over the next few hours. Finally my name was called and I was led to another waiting room where, you guessed it, I sat and waited some more. There were many other people there as well, probably 25 or so by mid-morning. 

We were each called into an examination room individually, where a nurse (or doctor, it wasn't clear) took my height and weight, checked my eyesight, asked if I was pregnant, and then ushered my into a small room and told me to strip off everything above the waist. A door on the other side of the room opened, and I was brought into another room where I was x-rayed, and then put back in the small room and told to clothe myself. After waiting in the waiting room (a very aptly named room!) some more, my name was called and I met with a doctor who checked my blood pressure and breathing, looked over my x-ray, asked some basic health questions, and voila! I was done. After a few more minutes of waiting, I got my approved medical certificate, and was led to a small office with an OFII officer, who would theoretically look over my materials and give me the OFII certificate in my passport.  

This is where things went a bit awry: due to several misunderstandings between myself and my university, I didn't have a required document, the proof of residency in Paris. The officer therefore wouldn't issue me my OFII certificate. I called my university and they sorted it out, but I ended up having to come back to the OFII office later that afternoon with proof of residency and was then given my OFII certificate. Kind of a pain in the tuckus, but I was just happy to be done with it!

All in all, the process was mainly just boring. Thankfully two of my friends had the same appointment time as me, so we ended up going through the whole thing together. But I would strongly recommend taking a book! Also, although the doctors and nurses were exceedingly kind, the OFII officers I dealt with were... rude, to say the least.

The poor, i.e. the many ('oi polloi') are mostly paying the bill, as it has always been done in the course of human history. They are paying in innumerable ways, from the lowering of their income to the decimation of all the public services that they have been relying on (the rich can afford private services).

The rich (those that did most of the sinning) are always insulated from these things. They will be the last to pay, if they ever do. Their money protects them, again in innumerable ways. Money is power and this power will always be used to protect its owner's interests. The more money, the more insulation.

true,CheapandCheerful,null,null,"Thinking about what to suggest has made me realize that all I do in Paris is eat... so here are my recommendations for a few restaurants!

Bodega 64 is a wonderful Spanish tapas place in le Marais, located at 66 rue François Miron. The food is excellent and not terribly expensive (you can get three tapas, which is plenty for one hungry person, for 13 euros) and it is very local and non-touristy. The woman who runs it is quite a character-- she bustles about speaking loudly in French and dispensing advice whether asked for or not. 

Also in le Marais is [Pitzman](http://www.yelp.com/biz/pitzman-paris), a delicious Jewish restaurant. They have a window for a quick take-away meal, or you can sit inside, which is cramped in the most wonderful way. Their pizza is incredible (they offer many other things as well, but I had a pizza there), the entire atmosphere is very friendly and bustling, and the pricing is just right (i.e. not expensive).

If you're looking to enjoy a slightly more expensive, but very traditional and yummy French dinner or lunch, I would highly recommend [La Closerie des Lilias](http://www.closeriedeslilas.fr/), located on the southern tip of the Luxembourg Gardens. They have a piano bar, restaurant, and brasserie. The piano bar is wonderful on its own, although it is really more for a couple or a group of friends than for a family. I have never eaten at the restaurant (too expensive for a student!) but the brasserie is honestly as good as many full-fledged restaurants I have been to in the US. I spent about 30 euros on dinner there, although I only had a main dish and a glass of wine. In addition to boasting delicious food, the atmosphere of this place is out the wazoo and the service is impeccable.

In more general terms, I strongly urge you to avoid eating anywhere around any major tourist sites (think Notre Dame, Eiffel Tower, etc), as the food there is overpriced and not very tasty. Even getting one or two metro stops away from the very center of Paris helps in finding better restaurants. Also, don't be afraid to try a very greasy and cheap option like shawarma or gyros, especially if you're trying to eat quickly in between sight-seeing. 

I hope my recommendations help, and have fun in Paris! ",0,1342782185,null,0,false,0,c5gqj3y,t3_wlyy1,t1_c5gqj3y,t3_wlyy1,null,1429423593,2,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,2

Pour l’entretien de la force publique, et pour les dépenses d’administration, une contribution commune est indispensable. Elle doit être également répartie entre tous les Citoyens, en raison de leurs facultés.""

C'est principe C°el depuis 1973 (c.a.d l'incorporation du bloc de constitutionnalité).
Dans le principe cela suppose qu'un impôt qui pèserait trop lourd sur l'une ou l'autre des catégorie soc-pro, violerait l'égalité de la charge fiscale (principe C°el). Sont caractère temporaire ou exceptionnel peut être argué mais alors il faudrait que le Conseil accepte que la C° soit de portée limité en temps de crise (institutionnelle ou politique) ce que plus ou moins même l'article 16 de prévoit pas (plein pouvoir du président en cas de menace pour l'intégrité territorial). Je vois mal le Conseil accepter cela.

À lire pour un rapide exposé : http://www.vie-publique.fr/decouverte-institutions/finances-publiques/ressources-depenses-etat/ressources/qu-est-ce-que-principe-egalite-fiscale.html

Cependant je n'ai pas réussi à trouver dans la juris du Conseil une explication sur ce que serait selon eu un impôt brisant le ppe d'égalité, l'argument toujours avancé à l'encontre des lois de finances étant rarement entendu par les Sages. Le plus souvent il ne le traite même pas, se bornant a estimer que le moyen est sans fondement sans vraiment détailler pourquoi. En 1993 la progressivité a même reçu valeur C°elle

Originally he was the parking attendant for the filming location of ""Texas"" and they decided to give him a minor role for the fun of it.  
When filming 00 Schneider you will note that he always looks into the camera driving the producer nuts. He also insisted on putting his own lines into the movie from time to time. In one scene you will hear him randomly complaining that *they* don't even manage to get him a pack of cigarettes. That was actually addressed towards the film crew, because he was a chain smoker and at some point didn't want him to smoke so much. He insisted on keeping that line into the movie. His most infamous line became ""so lange man lebt, soll man rauchen."" (you shall smoke as long as you live). Körschgen died in August 2002 of lung cancer.

bullshit, the situation was that tsipras and his communists announced that if they were to win the election, they'd be happy to keep receiving eu money but would stop obeying the already negotiated austerity measures. so the rest of europe, lead by germany, made it clear that greece would only keep receiving money if they stuck to the plan they had agreed upon. we have better things to do with our money than to throw it down a bottomless barrel. we didn't threaten you, we just told you what consequences your actions may have

and our politicians have to justify their actions to german voters as well. no one votes for politicians that simply give our money to greece without also forcing them to give some guarantees and agree to some measures that make it realistic that we will ever see our money again.

and deregulation of our own labour market and cuts to our social system a decade ago (look up the hartz reforms) was what enabled us to survive the euro and financial crisis as well as we did. all the cuts the greeks are whining about right now are so harsh because they didn't make them a decade ago (which is where greek voters become responsible, they preferred voting for parties that kept up the illusion and didn't force some tough cuts on them), and now they have to be brutal to save the ship from sinking

and some food for thought after your little rant about evil politicians that are robbing the poor man and can't be held responsible: let me tell you about christian wulff, former president of germany, who had to resign a few months ago because rumours were spreading that he had taken a loan from his bank over 500.000 euros with just 1% interest rate instead of the usual 4%. the man hasn't really broken any laws, wasn't directly bribed etc, the mere sugestion that he might have taken an advantage that was unavailable to other citizens was enough to make the german public go nuts. this is how we deal with politicians that are not up to our ethical standards, how about you do the same and stop whining

and a last word on your politicians and elections: if my government has to choose whom to deal with in greece, between both alternatives we obviously favor the slightly shady old boys club of new democracy, while we don't want anything to do with the guy (tsipras) who even before elections announces that should he win he'll abandon all austerity measures previously agreed upon. you can vote for whoever you want, but don't expect us to keep playing ball if greece decides it wants to be ruled by an unexperienced communist madman",0,1342789006,null,0,false,0,c5grg2z,t3_wucbt,t1_c5grg2z,t1_c5gra63,null,1429424016,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Please understand this, Germany does not lead Europe. As a matter of fact Europe is in this state because we allowed ourselves to be lead. 

Nevertheless that doesn't matter, and I believe the problem is that so many fail to understand it. Right now it doesn't matter if Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, Italy Siemens, Merkel, Sarkosy, Barroso or whoever is our favorite scapegoat messed up big time. What matters is that EUROPE IS A SINKING SHIP, and we all should be working together to find solutions instead of holding debates on whose fault is it. 

So, if there is not a sparkle of empathy in the German people, I ask you to consider the following: when Germany helps Greece, it is not helping Greece, It is helping Germany.

Edit: I'm sorry, Heiminator. This rant wasn't really meant for you, I actually agree with so much that you are saying. The problem is that I'm suffering the European crisis on my own skin and sometimes certain comments, although absolutely truth, hurt more than they should, offer no solution and just expand the distance between us when we should be more united. So bottom line, together we are stronger and we all should be work for the greater good of Europe. Take care.

true,ton2lavega,null,null,"oui mais le problème avec ces francisations est qu'elles ne respectent absolument pas la structure étymologique.

Par exemple, avec ""pourriel"", le remplacement du ""c"" par un ""p"" fait qu'on perd totalement le lien étymologique avec ""courrier"" et ""courriel"". Donc le mot n'a plus de rapport avec son origine.

En plus, pour les anglophones, un ""mail"" c'est quelque chose de bien différent d'un ""email"" : si vous dites à un anglais ""I'll send you a picture of my cat by mail"", il va s'attendre à recevoir la photo ... par courrier postal ! Utiliser ""mail"" pour dire en fait ""email"" est typiquement français. Donc mél est tout aussi stupide.


Je préfère préserver l'information sur le mot original en l'utilisant tel quel comme il est écrit en anglais. Au moins on sait d'où ça vient. En appelant un spam un spam, on conserve l'origine du terme et le sketch des Monty Python. En appelant un lolcat un lolcat, on conserve l'information sur l'origine du terme, la racine ""lol"", etc.

&gt;One CD with information about 1,000 suspected tax evaders is said to have cost 3.5 million euros ($4.3 million). Thomas Eigenthaler, chairman of the German Tax Workers Union, said he thoroughly approves of the move. ""The 3.5 million euros was very well invested,"" he said. ""I expect a lot of corrected returns to come from people who fear they could be implicated by the CDs.
Judging by past experience, Eigenthaler is right. In 2010, several German states acquired illegally produced CDs with customer data from Switzerland, Luxembourg and Lichtenstein. After that, the number of voluntary disclosures by tax evaders soared to about 25,000. Previous years saw only 2,000 people come forward to the tax authorities.
The 2010 disclosures led to about 2 billion euros in extra revenue for German state coffers, according to the German Tax Workers Union. The state of North-Rhine Westphalia alone raked in 300 million extra euros.""

the swiss are really pissed about that, and we do the same shit with lichtenstein and andorra, so you can rest easily, knowing that we put all this pressure on everyone that tries to evade taxes around here

Coming back to your question: I don't think the examples you cite are similar at all with why this happened in Romania.

Here it's the Rroma themselves refuse to integrate in the Romanian society (see some of my - and other Romanians' comments - in this thread) but still they expect to be given the benefits of living in it. Yes, rising the fences is narrow-minded and just a way to hide the actual problem, but the inhabitants don't have any impediments on their mobility. Nobody is preventing them from finding a job (or a better job) and better living conditions, nobody is preventing them from going to school and trying to do better than their peers. However these things are not happening.

So your claim of being similar to the way Jews, Palestinians or black people in the US were treated is a bit offensive for me.

You've seen the video, the garbage, the burned walls, the dirty children and the general feeling of desolation in those places. Who do you think made them the way they are now? Is it the society's fault that a group of people can not adapt themselves of living in it? Is it the state's fault that they don't bring these places in a liveable condition, only to have them vandalized in a matter of years, or maybe months? I, for one don't think so.

That proves nothing. You have to actually link the crisis, in all its forms with this problem. You are just saying ""Look at how big your problems were! Now that you're in trouble it's impossible that the cause is something else"". That's like looking at a drug addict that had the building block where he lived burn down and telling him ""Your life is a mess, therefore that's why your apartment caught fire!"". 

What you fail to understand is that sovereign debt is just part of the crisis. The underlying problem lies with some organisations having too much money lying around and nowhere to invest it. It's a normal process of capitalism: Excess capital is accumulated and invested. It doesn't matter how good the investment is, eventually it will become impossible that the majority of investments are paid back.

In Germany, each states police code clearly defines the circumstances under which the police is able to search you and your belongings (as a preventive measure, so outside of the StPO).

An example being the police code of Hessen, the HSOG:

http://www.landesrecht-hessen.de/gesetze/31_oeffentliche_sicherheit/310-63-hsog/paragraphen/para36.htm

Look at §36, Absatz II, Nr. 2. A location according to §18, Absatz II, Nr. 1 is defined by the states ministry of the interior. This can for example be a park where people deal drugs or the entire area around a large train station.

This means that around the train station, including all surrounding streets, the police can not only stop you and check your ID, but search you and your belongings without any cause whatsoever.

For a fraction reserve of 10:1 (the banks borrowing 10 times as much as they get, which is standard for deposits in modern times), the economy has to keep expanding around 3% (the math is somewhere) for that money to exist in reality, and that's exponentially because each year depends on the last. Some find that was only possible while exploiting other countries and with cheap power, a situation that is slowly changing. There are financial products that reach 40, which means that rate of growth must be even higher.

As to whether it is lawful, that doesn't matter much when they intermingle with governments, especially the US, to the level of writing the laws that govern themselves.

As to whether it is harmful, that is quite a debate. I would say it is very much (at the current level), because the expanding/bursting bubbles hurt the poor terribly every time it happens, while the banks get richer and more powerful. I don't have the models to know how the full impact of things like leveraging, high frequency trading and commodities markets, but at the level they are they are clearly creating bubbles that harm/benefit the same people, for virtually no risk and no work (economy growth) whatsoever. In fact, it is equivalent to skimming of the top cents on a huge number of transactions, it adds up. I'm willing to accept that liquidity is good for an economy, but the levels of inequality, uncertainty, poverty and unrest that are being generated by the level that such methods have achieved are reaching critical levels that cannot be dismissed for very long.

It would be better to discuss the fact that this financial model is failing at the level of deregulation and unaccountability it has achieved before people start starving and rioting, but states are never clever enough to realize it. We will live in interesting times, but I fear they will be very bloody again because the powers that be are unmovable and the masses are placated until they can't eat, and they they get ugly.

""Tecnico"" è solo un appellativo informale che si dà ai governi composti da persone fuori dal mondo della politica, in realtà non c'è nessuna differenza formale con un governo politico.

Quindi quanto segue vale sia per i governi tecnici che politici: il limite di tempo di un governo è legato alla durata del Parlamento, quindi al massimo 5 anni; un governo può durare di meno se il Parlamento vota contro di esso (Voto di Fiducia), ma spetta al Presidente della Repubblica decidere se continuare lo stesso, chiedere ai parlamentari quale nuovo governo vorrebbero, oppure sciogliere il Parlamento e andare alle elezioni.

In pratica non è mai successo che un Governo durasse 5 anni; il record è del Governo Berlusconi II (2001-2005), in media durano 1-2 anni o anche meno. Quando un governo cade, di solito il Presidente cerca di trovare un accordo fra i partiti principali per formare un nuovo Governo, perché le elezioni sono un processo lungo e difficile per la nazione, ma se proprio non ci riesce non resta altro che andare a votare.

We don't accuse anyone of invading Portugal because:

1) Do onto others. We don't like when our neighbors son/daughter complains about discrimination in whatever country they've settled in.

2) Our tradition is one of integration and acceptance. We mostly try not to pass judgement by what you look like or what you are, but rather who you are.

true,EuroTreasure,NORW,Norway,"Norway is led by a three party coalition government between the Socialist Party, Labour Party(social democrats with a dominant neo-liberal wing and a more socialist-leaning wing, much like the UK Labour I guess), and a party which calls itself the Centrist party, which in reality is a special-interest party for farmers and rural folks.

They call themselves the Red-Green Coalition,

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-Green_Coalition

 ..and one of the great lies in Norwegian politics is that this is a match made in heaven and that they share a common set of values. This could not be the further from the truth. The Center-party has borderline social conservative values that reflect the historical Norwegian rural Christian heritage, while the Socialists are liberal and urban. 

Labour is about three times bigger than the two others together and dominates the government. The junior partners have to pretend that they are best friends and time after time have their issues been left out by the dominant Labour, and when one of them get one of their issues into the offical poltics of the coalition, its often at expense at the other junior partner. This have made these two junior parties steadily lose more and more of their core voters, and in Norway 4% is some kind of magic number when it comes to representation in the Parliament, if you get less than this, you can only really just get one seat in the Parlament, because they want to ensure that Norwegian politics turns Italian, with a lot of parties. So when you cross over 4%, you suddenly get a lot of seats, actually an overrepresentation, so basically 3% could give you 1 seat, while 4.2% could get you 8. So it’s very very important to don’t fall under this limit if you want to remain relevant in Norwegian politics.

Well guess what, both junior partners are floating around this magic number right now, and they are getting desperate. Election is one year away, so they start making their own statements whose sole purpose is to rally their historic voters. The Centrist party did this with the ban on circumcision, but that does not sit well with the socialists who have a lot of muslim voters. So Labour had to save the day, and basically said that circumcision should not be banned, but rather be paid for by the government. 

I guess some of the arguments for a ban, was that many of these procedures were done outside of a clinical setting, but that was not the main issue that the Centrist Party wanted to raise, they were primarily coming from a standpoint where it was unethical to alter the body of a minor. So if it makes no sense, it’s because it is not sense. It’s politics. As Bismarck said, he who has seen how politics and sausages are made does not sleep well at night.

I think they should make it illegal to perform circumcision outside a hospital, and I think that the government should not pay for it. I am not the kind who usually goes “My tax money should not…!”, but seriously, my tax money should not go to cosmetic surgery based on 3000 year old beliefs.


Edit:

tl:dr: It does not make sense becuase the coalition goverment is flipp-flopping on the issues and sending mixed signals to please all of the core voters of the parties involed. There will be no ban in Norway.

Les langues s'enrichissent les unes les autres, depuis toujours. 
Combien de mot arabes utilise-t'on sans le savoir ? 
Allez, quelques exemples : alambic, mesquin, matelas, abricot, mousseline, épinard, etc.
Notre langue est remplie de mots étrangers et c'est très bien comme ça...

Je rajouterai que la force de l'anglais, c'est sa capacité à inclure dans un mot un concept technique, et cela de manière à peu près compréhensible par le plus grand nombre. En français, il faut généralement plusieurs mots pour avoir l'équivalent. C'est la raison pour laquelle dans toutes les filières techniques, les termes anglais sont préférés.
Et les nouvelles technologies comme Internet (mot anglais, celui-là accepté par l'Académie française) n'y échappent pas.

Et puis comme cela a été dit, au final, ce sont les gens qui tranchent. Une langue évolue, et c'est les gens qui la parlent qui la transforment, pas des vieux croûtons qui se touchent la nouille dans leur bureau doré.
Les recommandations de l'Académie ne sont jamais utilisées de toute façon. Par exemple, qui a déjà entendu quelqu'un parler d'une ""auto-caravane"" ? (oui oui... c'est un camping-car version Académie française...)

&gt;non **capisca** completamente **la vostra** sistema di governo.

È *capisco* (1° persona singolare, non 3°), non *capisca*. E *sistema* è un sostantivo maschile e non femminile (è la 'a' finale che inganna!), quindi la forma corretta è *il vostro sistema*.


&gt;cio mi ha fatto mi domando...

La forma corretta è *ciò*, ma so che è complesso usare gli accenti correttamente con una tastiera americana (ho lo stesso problema con l'islandese!). ;)
In ogni caso la costruzione della frase è un po' sballata: più esattamente si potrebbe dire *e quindi mi sono domandato...*


&gt;Come si decide **di** avere nuove elezioni?

La frase non è sbagliatissima, ma il *di* mi suona un po' male... Forse sarebbe più scorrevole con un *quando*.


&gt;Prego scusatemi il mio Italiano

Dovrebbe essere *per favore* e non *prego* qui. E una costruzione più corretta è *scusatemi per il mio italiano*, dato che il complemento oggetto (in questo caso 'me') è già incluso nel verbo 'scusatemi' e quindi non ha senso averne due (sia 'me' che 'il mio italiano'; anche perché noi umani non possiamo 'scusare' qualcosa di astratto come la lingua italiana! *wink*).


&gt;ma **prego rispondere** in Italiano 

Anche qui serve un *per favore*, come sopra. E dovresti usare l'imperativo e non l'infinito (quindi *rispondete* al posto di *rispondere* - errore comprensibile, dato che in inglese in questi casi si usa l'infinito).


&gt;perché **è meglio** per continuare ad imparare la lingua. Correzioni grammaticali sempre **benvenuto**.

In questo contesto *è meglio* non funziona bene. L'espressione più esatta è *il modo migliore* (è più formale ed elegante specificare di cosa si sta parlando [il sostantivo 'modo'] e trattandosi di un nome si deve usare l'aggettivo comparativo 'migliore').

*Correzioni grammaticali* è un sostantivo femminile plurale, quindi devi usare *benvenute* e non *benvenuto* (maschile singolare). La frase che hai usato va più che bene in un contesto informale come questo, ma una costruzione più completa e formale potrebbe essere *Eventuali correzioni grammaticali sono sempre benvenute*.


In ogni caso complimenti per il corretto uso degli accenti *é*/*è*! È una distinzione che la maggioranza degli italiani - me inclusa - non sottolinea spesso, per pigrizia o ignoranza. E complimenti anche per lo spelling!

Se dovessi avere domande od ulteriori dubbi, non esitare a chiedere! ;)

true,thomas_slothrop,basilicata,,"Ogni presidente della Repubblica può nominare dei Senatori a vita e in molti lo fanno. Inizialmente era un'onoreficenza data a chi si distingueva all'interno della società: scienziati, scrittori, uomini di cultura eccetera; da qualche tempo a questa parte, però, vengono di solito nominati senatori a vita quasi esclusivamente politici. La mossa di Napolitano di nominare Monti senatore a vita non era necessaria, ma politicamente molto forte: il presidente ha così ""fatto sapere"" pubblicamente che lui avrebbe sponsorizzato un governo Monti.  
I poteri del presidente della Repubblica sono quasi tutti formali, il più importante è quello di firmare le leggi approvate dal parlamento: egli può rifiutarsi di firmarle solo se sono in evidente contrasto con la Costituzione italiana. Se una legge viene respinta dal presidente (cosa piuttosto inusuale) torna in parlamento, dove può essere modificata o ripresentata senza modifiche al presidente della Repubblica. Se la legge viene ripresentata senza modifiche, il presiente ha l'obbligo di firmare la legge anche se la ritiene incostituzionale, a meno che non decida di dimettersi (cosa mai successa nella storia della Repubblica).  
Un altro potere del presidente della Repubblica è quello di sciogliere le camere, come ha detto prima Wedhro, ma anche qui è l'aspetto formale che conta: le camere venogno sciolte sempre di comune accordo con i maggiori partiti.

Come saprai, in Italia noi non eleggiamo direttamente né il presidente della Repubblica né quello del consiglio (e da qualche anno neanche i parlamentari, in pratica, ma vabbè...), quindi sono i parlamentari a votare per noi. Per questo motivo il governo Monti (che viene chiamato ""tecnico"") è pienamente legittimo, a dispetto di quelli che hanno gridato al colpo di stato (o quasi). La legislatura di norma dura 5 anni, dopo dei quali si va alle elezioni, e questo è indipendentemente dai governi che si succedono all'interno della legislatura stessa -- di fatto, però, in Italia questa è un'eccezione, e spesso si ricorre al voto anticipato.

are enjoyed by those born within marriage.

Section 2 means that the state is going to watch over and prevent *any and all* infringements of your kid's rights. Rightfully so, they're not your bloody property but human beings. They don't take away kids on a whim.

It has happened in other countries before (briefly) and has normally been accompanied by pogroms and lynch mobs against Jews. 

So, there is, as far as I know (perhaps there is a major instance which I just am unaware of), no precedent for a ban on circumcision which is bereft of Antisemitism or is not heralding a new movement against the Jews. The Jews of Germany have good reason to be anxious about this, and I don't understand how *any* Germans could think that this would not hurt their international image. When it has *always* been an Antisemitic move, no amounts of saying ""No, it's different this time!"" will erase suspicions that Germany is becoming an Antisemitic country (again). 

If you're dubious or if you just want more information, I'll find you a bunch of examples and sources. The main point, though, is that a ban on circumcision is almost *inherently* Antisemitic.

If anything, failing states like Spain could learn a thing or two from Texas, which has been pretty successful throughout the last decade. What's Spain's youth unemployment? 50%?

Spain's current strategy of chasing away their tax base, business, and continuously increasing the public dependence on the state is having the result that even a five year-old could predict.

&gt;Prvih dana dolazila sam prljava, raščupana i poderane odjeće, ali i tako mala znala sam da nešto moram učiniti od svog života. Kod kuće je bio živi pakao: otac je fizički zlostavljao našu majku, zbog čega je na kraju dobio i dvije i pol godine kazne zatvora. Sa 16 godina prvi put sam se zaljubila, ali otac je imao druge planove za mene. Odlučio me prodati u obitelj ženika kojega je već odredio, za gajbu piva. Otišla sam u centar za socijalnu skrb i rekla im da ću trgovačku školu, koju sam pohađala, završiti milom ili silom. Nastala je strahovita svađa, morala sam bježati 

Girl talks how her father had ""other plans"" for her. Instead of going to school he sold her for 20 bottles of beer. She had to run from home to finish high school

&gt;Željka Balog, učenica varaždinske srednje škole, prisjetila se mučnog slučaja kad je djevojka prodana u Italiju za 5000 eura. Premda i sama Romkinja, mentalitet njezina naroda koji podržava ovakve mučne događaje ni najmanje se ne sviđa Dijani Balog, 19-godišnjakinji iz Puščina koja pohađa prvu godinu sestrinstva na višoj školi.

Girl remembers a case when another girl was sold for 5000 Euro to Italy.

Your statement equating Spain with ""socialism"" is pretty fucking stupid, for starters.  It is almost like you haven't even heard of Canada, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, or a million other places that probably fit your definition of ""socialism"" and provide an infinitely nicer lifestyle than Texas.

Dallas is like three skyscrapers in the middle of the desert, Houston is a fiery hot hellhole made of ugly glass buildings, El Paso, depressing, Amarillo --- wtf, Amarillo?

All I personally know of Spain is that I was just there in May.  It is a lovely place, filled with lovely stylish people and VIBRANT culture.  I took the immaculate Renfe trains from city to city, and in spite of my very shaky Spanish, people in the smallest towns to the largest cities were nothing but charming and nice.

They had some protests in Sevilla last time I was there also and it really made me feel that democracy was alive there, something sorely lacking in America.  The Spanish are not frightened little sheep like America, and they are ready to march for their rights and to punish the bankers who made the mess to begin with, something that will never happen in the US.

You get the sense while yes there is a crisis, communities and people take care of each other in a way that generally does not happen in most of the US, based on what I saw.

One last thing.  I hate to break it to you Sparky, but you're living in a dream world.  Your USD is quickly becoming a US peso, and this trend is going to accelerate as the world slowly wakes up to the fact that the US balance sheet is much worse than Greece, and the last time I checked Texas is in the US.  When the bond vigilantes come, and they will be coming soon, the US will attempt to print its way out of the mess and pretty soon the ""American way of life"" will be changing even more than it already has.

The ""socialist shitbags"" as you call them are already tightening their belts overseas and will be just fine once the Euro is done cracking up and sovereign balance sheets resettle.  The US?  We're doing some bad, bad things with our budget, based on the conservative appeal to ""low taxes"" and when the bond vigilante bill comes it is going to hit Texas ESPECIALLY hard because you cowboys and cowgirls always receive much more in federal funds than you pay in taxes, so you'll feel the bite the most when ""big government"" starts having more problems.

&gt;The Spanish are not frightened little sheep like America, and they are ready to march for their rights and to punish the bankers who made the mess to begin with, something that will never happen in the US.

That's because Americans aren't greedy fuckbags.

&gt;You get the sense while yes there is a crisis, communities and people take care of each other in a way that generally does not happen in most of the US, based on what I saw.

Thanks for your insight into Spanish culture, I'm sure you learned much in your week there as a tourist.

&gt;Your USD is quickly becoming a US peso,

Not as fast as the Euro. I've got about $20k bet against the Euro at the moment and I'm fairly sure this will net me a very large profit.

&gt;and the last time I checked Texas is in the US. 

Texas is one of the few productive states in the US. Attempting to average us out with unproductive, union-infested states and then draw conclusions about Texas in particular is a transparently dishonest argument.

&gt; We're doing some bad, bad things with our budget, based on the conservative appeal to ""low taxes"" 

I love how Democrats are in charge of the government but conservatives still get blamed for what they do. Lay off the Kool-ade.

They don't respect the natives and they don't respect the law. Most of their crimes are just minor violations but it adds up in the public's mind.

The reason why there are so many negative news stories in the local media all over Europe and why these ""horror stories you have heard from others"" exist in such a large abundance is because of how the Roma behave in Western and Northern Europe. This isn't some kind of an ethnic hunt. Many of them really do come here to beg, steal and scam and they apparently see it as completely normal behavior for themselves. Is one supposed to deny reality when forming opinions on a group of people? 

When you come face to face with Roma beggars and traders (aka. scammers) a few times, it tends to change your opinions. The spitting and cursing Roma beggars, who thankfully are a minority, are my favourite at creating resentment. People hate that kind of uncivilized behavior. Is that racism? Sure. Did they bring it down on themselves? For the most part, yes.

*edit: There are different groups of native Roma all over Europe and the groups can be quite dissimilar. When people talk negatively about ""Roma"" they usually mean the travellers from Romania or nearby. In Finland and Sweden for example live a Roma people who call themselves the Finnish Kale.

The short answer is: Because in your country it would be an isolated incident which would be quickly and efficiently dealt with.

The long answer is: corruption is self-sustaining and self-feeding. The more it permeates the various layers of a society, the less feasible it is to *start* fighting it. Injustices are done left and right, one injustice is thought (by those that are doing it) to 'correct' for another and in the end, everybody thinks that this is normal and in any case at least easier than uprooting the whole thing and starting again from scratch.

For example, some of the doctors that accept  the 'fakelaki' (which means 'small envelope' by the way) are probably underpaid by the State to begin with. Others are not of course (because they retain private practice offices as well) and it is simply a matter of greed for them.

""Mr Cameron says he is not for leaving the union but does want to renegotiate the terms of membership, and then perhaps put the result to a popular vote. Amid the talk of repatriating powers, William Hague, the foreign secretary, this month launched an audit of the EU’s authority.""

This really just plays up the divisiveness and the fragmentation inside of the Euro zone, and offers nothing beyond the banal political commentary one can already witness by watching various political proceedings from within different countries.

Disclaimer:  I am an Economist subscriber, so obviously I don't completely hate or ignore this publication.  

There is a consistent theme to its articles, though.  The theme is simply one of ""a European economic block is destined for failure, so don't even bother.""

The thing that sticks in my craw is that they give Cameron, a Tory troll and EU hater a platform to further push the UK away from European integration.  He does this not only economically, but also culturally and politically as well.

I'll also give you another disclaimer that I'm a citizen of the US, the UK, and of Ireland, all of which have a myriad of competing claims to European political maneuvers but also various stakes in its economic claims as well.

Increasingly The Economist is used as a platform not for insightful journalistic commentary, but as a way to mirror the reigning UK/US view (inside the anglophone world) that both countries are somehow moral and economic leaders for future continental ambitions, when nothing could be further from the truth.

I find it equally paradoxical that Ireland who has weathered the storms of European power struggles (for lack of a better term) for so many centuries now finds itself the Anglo flag-bearer of a future European solidarity.

It truly boggles the mind.  For now, I'll continue to read The Economist only as it serves to offer a London based perspective of US and other news of economic relevance from an external perspective, but if I don't see more diversity of opinion or at least more impartial journalism I'll not renew.

Fair enough, and I understand where you're coming from, however I think your example is very weak.

And on a related note, ask yourself when was the last time that something *good* happened in the EU that was newsworthy. It's very hard for a feel-good story to be as newsworthy as a story about *a country about to go bankrupt*. Perhaps the reason we're seeing negative news all the time is because that's all there is to report on? Or, maybe because negative news is more interesting? Who knows.

I'm glad you can brag about the ""awesome"" business climate of Texas, ignoring the fact that:

1.  Texas is leading the way in trying to insert Creationism into US science classes.
2.  Texas is now functioning as the politburo of American education, with social studies curriculum that will put a conservative stamp on history and economics textbooks, stressing the superiority of American capitalism, questioning the Founding Fathers’ commitment to a purely secular government and presenting Republican political philosophies in a more positive light.   This is being done solely because with the scale and size of the state of Texas, they intend to influence the curriculum of the entire US.

If you think about that strongly and still disagree with me, then we'll have to agree to disagree because surely we have perspectives that absolutely cannot be resolved through a simple Reddit discussion.  :)

I see much cause for celebration coming out of the European continent.  A few examples if I may:

- Norway's continued dominance in many world metrics (HDI, Prosperity Index Ranking, #3 at $302.51 donar aid per capita 2011, #3 at 69.9% EPI index 2012, #3 happiest country (Gallup), #2 Gender Equality (World Economic Forum) among other things
- Scandinavian dominance in many similar metrics
- Special mention to Finland, ranked best in education globally by many sources
- Germany, who has a strong economy that even [the US can admire](http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/the-us-discovers-germany-as-an-economic-role-model-a-822167.html), and a very good football team even if said football team could make it all the way to the top of the Euro Cup.  :)
- A special mention to France for having the intelligence to ditch Sarkozy in favor of Hollande.  Does having the best food in the world count as a metric?  :)
- I especially love that some ""East European"" countries (cough, Estonia) have much better public balance sheets than the US.
- Switzerland.  A CHF that appreciates even though the Swiss govt. doesn't want it to because the world knows it is a safe haven.  Some of the best trains in the world, and certainly the best watches and chocolate.  Ranked #1 in the Global Innovation Index.

I won't beat this dead horse.  Instead of listening to the drumbeat of bad news coming out of Europe, it is best to recognize that there are few things yet that the world still admires about European countries.

That's true to an extent, but the EU was doing precisely what needed to be done there. If you think fishermen up in the UK weren't complaining as *they* got ""shafted"" then you're mistaken. Everyone did in their minds, because overfishing was rampant and the common fisheries policy was a requirement to working toward sustainable fishing. Nevertheless, Greece had a considerably more agrarian economy, and that worked for them. They weren't rich, but they had a functioning economy - now they don't.

&gt;We will turn into paradises following the model of Latvia, with a third of the educated youth gone, 23% GDP loss and no social services, all to pay for your high horse.

Privatised social services is different than no social services. As for the fate of Latvia, look to Estonia. They suffered a similar collapse in terms of magnitude, but through strict austerity they have already recovered to 2007 levels of income, and are predicted to achieve 25% growth of the economy by 2016. Latvia's recovery has been slower, but they're likely to return to 2007 levels of income in mid-2013. Brain drain is inevitable in the modern EU, but educated people follow the money and the growth, and the Baltic countries are going to be somewhere to go in the near future.

Yawn.

This doesn't change, despite your hand-waving, the fact is that the Democrats are in control and have firmly continued the path that Bush had led us down.

&gt;I'm glad you can brag about the ""awesome"" business climate of Texas

That was what this thread was about, was it not? Texas is the best state in the US to do business.

&gt;Texas is leading the way in trying to insert Creationism into US science classes.

Here, I'll concede the point: conservatives are wrong on this.

&gt;Texas is now functioning as the politburo of American education

Deal with it, this is the fault of your worship of government. If you don't like it you should be lobbying for less central control. Or you should create a state that is more powerful to counter it. Oh wait, you can't because states governed by leftists are doomed to stagnation and decay!

&gt;Bush

So you're going to denigrate an entire state of 28 million people solely because of a president that wasn't born in it? Durrr....

&gt;You live there, and are proud of the state

I'm actually not proud of the state and I hate Texas conservatives. Unfortunately you've drawn that conclusion from an obviously short perusal of my comments, which indicate nothing more than my residency in Texas at some point. Nice try, stalker.

&gt;I honestly think it is very cute that you believe in American exceptionalism and that the US is doing better than the EU.

And I think it's cute that you think the ongoing collapse of the Euro is insignificant.

&gt;It is kind of like you rooting for two retards, with you cheering on the retard that has less than .0002 liters less worth of drool running down their cheek.

Actually I'm voting third party this November. I'm guessing that your vote will be going toward a retard, though.

&gt;You and your ilk accuse Obama of being a ""Marxist"" and ""Socialist"" which is a very funny thing to call a center-right centrist.

Provide a link in this thread to me calling Obama a ""Marxist"" or ""Socialist"". Oh, you can't? What a surprise that you're a fucking liar. Also, ""center-right centrist""? Hilarious. 

&gt;Canada's success can be solely attributed to the Albertan tar sands.

Yes. Look at the numbers and come back to me.

&gt;Oh, and as for what words did you misspell? precesely

Ohh, a single word? That's it?

true,naughty,null,null,"Competition and geography. For almost 2,000 years Europe has been lots of competing and warring factions, none of which are big enough to take over the others. China is a large, unitary empire that's repeated a cycle of a few hundred years of peace then a hundred years of strife until a new regime takes over.

This is due to the geography of Europe and China, it's just easier to conquer larger areas in China than in Western and Southern Europe. Look at the fertile areas in China along the major rivers and the east coast, if you have them you can feed an army to defeat the rest.

For almost 1,500 years China was the most advanced civilisation on Earth (until about 1600s). But they had no nearby competition to force them to improve. The Europeans couldn't really conquer each other (but still had plenty of wars) so they colonised the world to try and defeat each other economically. The focus on commerce changed changed the nature of politics in Europe drastically as the middle class started to develop. So the law became less capricious and arbitrary and contracts were enforceable.

The Industrial Revolution changed everything, a lot fewer farmers were needed. So more people for mills and factories. It was a very dramatic change with lots of suffering, injustice and great advances. This has also been happening in China but a lot faster than in Europe or the US.

It's nothing to do with the people really, given time China will be innovating as much as the US and Europe. The only piece of the puzzle China is missing is a more stable legal and political system, but once they move from exports to internal consumption the pressure will be there to improve on that.

Oh grow up a little. I didn't say that any more than I said that Africans should stick to subsistence farming - but I'm not going to pretend like Kenya can become the financial capital of the world just because everyone moves to a city.

I'm not saying that only ""superior populations"" *should* have modern economies, I'm saying that countries like Greece *don't* have the economy they've acted like they do, and that they've wanted to have. THey simply don't, and pretending otherwise won't change anything. Greece has stopped producing as much, imports way more, and isn't particularly great at the services industries besides tourism and shipping management. There's an obvious problem there which needs to be solved by the sort of lower tech agricultural production which Greeks can easily achieve at this point in time.

&gt;certainly don't allow them to rent (unless the market crashes brutally), and is definitely not enough for privatized health or education which will lead to bigger class differences and potential clashes.

Let's not be dramatic now, Greek people were doing just fine in the 80's and 90's. Sure, they might not have had the luxury lives they had in the 2000's, but we all saw where going down that route lead them. Greece will be just fine, but it's going to have to accept that it's got a mediocre economy and after acting like it was Denmark or Sweden for a decade or two it's going to have to pay a lot of money out of its mediocre earnings to pay off that debt, which is going to make things tight, but that's the situation they're in.

1a) Schengen countries can accept whatever documents they want. And allow whomever they want. They are still souvereign in this matter. e.g. Germany has more lenient visa on Turkish then the Netherlands. 

1b) However if one country accepts you and grants you visa or residence then all other Schengen countries have to allow you entree (i don't think residence however). 

1c) Here's the tricky part. Without a valid travel document you can't enter any country even in schengen, even if its your own. This is because the country wants you to have a proof of who you are (that's your travel document). 

As for your story: Schengen does not disallow border checks. I have had 2 checks myself on the Dutch/German border. It only bans borders checks when they act as repellants for some people and goods (in a legal and/or practical way) that were allowed into Schengen in the first place.

My advice to you: make sure you have things sorted out when you actually visit one of those countries on the list. Maybe you can mail/call/visit their embassies in Germany. Otherwise i'm pretty sure that eventually you'll land into a legal mess that you don't wanna be in, especially when on vacation.

true,breisleach,NETH,The Netherlands,"Here's my two cents.

I think one of the problems is that technically you don't have a *passport*, rather you have a *travel document*. There is a legal difference. 

The Schengen area is rather complex especially when you are a third-country national. By default you do not have freedom of movement in the Schengen area.

Theoretically, your residence permit from Sweden should give you freedom of movement in the Schengen area, but you have to have a valid Travel Document/Passport to enter the Schengen area (the validity to be determined by the countries in the Schengen area themselves).

so:

1) I am guessing you were rejected because Germany does not recognise your travel document. Schengen allows for this (at entry). This means if you enter the Schengen Area through Germany you could legally be refused entry, since they are the first point of call. 

At the same time this is at odds with your residence permit in Sweden. Which is where the confusion started. This however deals with free movement within the Schengen area, not entering the Schengen area. However, as the email explained for transit reasons you should have been allowed entry. 

2)The links you provided only deal with the *issuing* of travel documents to refugees, and the status of refugees. The *legal recognition* of those travel documents is another issue and is not dealt with in those treaties.

3)I don't know the reasoning behind Germany's refusal of accepting your travel documents. I think one of the problems is that compared to passports and other travel documents, they are rather lacking in information and easily faked.

Please note though that under these rules, you'll only be allowed in Germany for **transit** purposes (that is, travel in order to get to the country for which you have a visa); this may be interpreted strictly whenever the German administration would feel like it, and that could prevent you from touristic or professional activities (like attending a scholarly conference in Germany)

As stated elsewhere in the thread, countries having signed the Schengen treaty retain full sovereignty over their admittance decisions.

2) There might very well be a conflict. Are you willing to litigate this in a German court, all the way up to a decision that would order the German administration to change its ways?

It is not an impossible task, as it has been done before; just very long, very grueling and very expensive.

3) There is no justification needed; this is a sovereign decision by the German administration and there are only two ways to change it:

- political order by the current executive branch
- litigation through the German courts (even the ECHR does not have the power to make Germany change its ways; they can only fine them every time it happens.)

You're looking at this the wrong way: you want to find some moral meaning into an administrative decision. There is none.

In moral terms, I agree that it is unfair and discriminatory. But it won't change the legal landscape.

*My advice*:

The travel document that the Lebanese state grants you is a mess, and you'll only have more problems with it as time goes by.

You're educated, you study abroad. You obviously speak decent English, have probably picked up a smattering of Swedish, most probably speak Arabic; with a Lebanese mother, there is a good chance you also speak French.

Why the hell are you not applying for citizenship in Sweden? Or in the UK? Or in France? These and some other Schengen countries have no qualms about their citizen holding dual citizenship, so that wouldn't make you abandon Lebanese/Palestinian citizenship if it is important to you.

These countries, while wanting you to have some significant integration into their national cultures, still won't pressure you into abandoning your Palestinian identity.

I don't know much about the Swedish citizenship process, but the French Republic has a specific high-speed naturalization path for highly-qualified immigrants. I have helped friends along that path, and it is not very difficult to get through it.
