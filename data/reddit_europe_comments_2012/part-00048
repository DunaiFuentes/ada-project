I lived in France for 4 years, those fuckers claim they invented that, too.

I don't speak Italian (I understand a bit) but even to me I can tell a significant difference between what Ticinesi speak and, say, Piemontese.  It just sounds ""flatter"", if that makes any sense.

It's easier with French because I speak it pretty fluently - let's assume that a Parisian / Île-de-France French is the equivalent of the stereotype that you often hear of Hanoverian being the ""cleanest"" high German, or RP being the ""standard"" British English (having lived a long time in Northern California, I won't even get into the shitfest of which is the ""normal"" American dialect).  

So Romand (Swiss French) is totally different from ""clean"" French.  It's similar to what you'd hear in South-Western Franche-Comté, and my French colleagues generally considered it ""slower"", and again, flat-ish.  The stereotype is that vowels are drawn out, and that the Romands talk....real....slow....(which is funny, because in the German Swiss regions, that is the joke about people from Bern).  It's similar to how Swiss German and really strong Schwäbisch / Alemannisch are quite close.

Also there is no ""Swiss German dialect"".  The difference between the Wallis, Basel, and Zurich are as strong as something you'd get between Pfalz, Sachsen, and Ostfriesen.  It's really extreme.

Wow, there's an essay.

But the really funny thing is how the Swiss Germans think the Romands are all a bunch of homosexual communists, the Romands think the Swiss Germans are uptight and obnoxious\*, everyone thinks the Ticinesi are lazy and annoying, and the Ticinesi just hate everyone.  It's awesome.  I have no idea why it works.  I think it's because everyone agrees to cheer for whoever's beating Germany in football. :D :D :D

* Picnic on the Île de la Barthelasse. 
* Walk to Villeneuve-lez-Avignon (across the river) and check out the monastery/fort.
* Go to L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue (about 40 min. away on TransVaucluse line 6) for their Thursday or Sunday morning market! And then continue on to Fontaine-de-Vaucluse, which is one the prettiest places I've ever seen. 
* Walk into Les Halles (open every morning apart from Monday) and go to the bread people two stalls down on the right. Their *baguette levain* is so amazing and I love their croissants as well.
* Eat at the Chat'Touilleur (near Places des Corps Saints); the leek-scallop crumble is so fuckin' bomb I can't even.
* Bagel &amp; Bagels (Place des Châtaignes) is admittedly overpriced, but the woman who owns/runs it is so lovely that you really have to visit.  She studies at pastry school, I think, and makes all of these yummy American desserts (cheesecake, carrot cake, brownies, cookies).
* Ginette &amp; Marcel (Place des Corps Saints) has yummy and affordable tartes and tartines.
* Check out Rue des Teinturiers for good eats &amp; dranks.
* If you have ever occasion to be out late, there's a secret *boulangerie* that is illegally open after hours.... Let me know if you're interested. :)

Tu n'as certainement pas été le seul à faire ce lien ce jour-là. La réaction de l'enseignante montre son manque de sagesse et le flou de sa pensée. Toute perturbation est en effet une occasion à saisir pour un pédaguogue chevronné, afin de renverser la situation à son avantage et de conquérir cœur et esprit. Tu peux être presque assuré que dans son cas elle n'avait pas grand chose à dire pour illustrer et défendre sa saillie. Qui était une quasi-provocation en fait, voire du terrorisme intellectuel.

Qu'est-ce qui lui permet de dire que le capitalisme marche ?* Tu peux étendre la liste des questions pendant longtemps... Bien entendu, elles amènent tout un travail préliminaire : clarifications des termes, analyse historique, etc. Ce qu'on est sensé faire en cours, normalement. Saurais-tu y répondre succinctement et pertinemment aujourd'hui, à ces questions ? Et tes camarades de l'époque ? Et l'électeur lambda ?

Une reproduction miniature d'un modèle de société. *Dans un premier temps, on dépossède les gens du savoir (ou le plus souvent, on ne les y amène jamais, ex. la manque de professionalisme que révèle la phrase catégorique de la prof d'éco). Ensuite, on leur interdit toute référence au passé (pas le droit de faire le parallèle Auschwitz/le travail libère). Enfin on récuse toute alternative ; pour garder l'exemple de ta prof, je propose une reformulation de ce qu'elle a dit : « le travail dans une société capitaliste est le seul apte à libérer l'homme, critiquer le capitalisme c'est souhaiter l'aliénation ou le chaos ».*

Laisse agir ces mécaniques quelques décennies, et tu obtiens des femmes et des hommes coupés de ce qui les élève dans leur humanité. L'absence d'esprit critique (capacité de discriminer, de discerner à l'aide des outils de la raison), de la connaissance du passé (origines, contextes, comparaison au présent), et de la possibilité de penser l'avenir (recherche d'alternative, sens de la vie, espoir). Ce sont ces trois points qui donnent à un Nicolas Sarkozy ou à une Marine le Pen la possibilité de ces sorties incroyables tout en évitant le tollé général.

Customers vote with their feet . It's easy enough to find a pub or restaurant where the hygiene looks ok. - although I've walked out of quite a few over the years .

If someone writes a long, well reasoned comment on a serious topic and someone picks out one incorrect word in an otherwise well-written post, that's just bullshit. It undermines the content of the comment as a whole and serves little purpose. If, for instance, someone has used ""it's/its"" correctly three times and the fourth time gets it wrong, I see no point in bothering to point it out. It's a typo, move on.

*However*, if someone makes an error and pointing it out will actually help that person, or others, then that's great. For instance, a word that is commonly misunderstood or misused. And an error can be pointed out without calling the person a dumbass.

An example would be a time when I incorrectly used the word ""Melay"" when I meant ""melee"". I actually knew the difference, I just goofed. However, it was right to correct me because it's something that people should know and may not. The person who corrected me sent a private message that read: I don't always correct people on reddit, but when I do, I do it privately. He went on to explain the difference and I thanked him. He could have commented, ""Hey, moron, you mean ""melee"". Melay is a place, idiot."" I see this a lot on here and it's more annoying than the error itself.

Also, there have been a few problems in the french medias these last years with dogs biting children resulting in huge wounds. So a lot of people went to training schools, and depending on the dog's pedigree its  master has to get lessons nowadays.

But I think the main point is that in Paris most people lives in flats, where their dogs can't run wild and they don't always have the time to get them into a park to play a little. So I guess the dogs get accustomed to remaining quiet.

The arguments hereabouts are not trivial and to do it justice would require an essay I'm not too prepared to write but in summary:

Debt is a ""promise to pay"" at some point in the future. Yes, fiat money is not backed by anything physical and is an abstract concept something which seems to upset a lot of people but the currency is basically a statement of faith in the country, its legal system and prospects.

Add in issues like inflation, economic growth and purchasing power and the layman is quickly whisked away from what is a comfortable ""i can touch this"" thing to basically magic. 

Assuming that we accept (I appreciate that you may not) a fiat monetary system is an acceptable means of transferring the concept of value then the debt is as real as anything. 

Debt is rolled over only insofar as the owner of the debt has faith that the profit in generating revenue from that debt exceeds the profit to be gained in doing something else, or that it helps them meet an obligation.

Take pension funds who are often holders of a lot of debt, they hold these bonds which are perceived as low risk in order to satisfy the future calls on their revenue streams. This is the main reason there is a direct link between annuity rates and interest rates. 

We need to stop thinking as everyone who holds financial assets as some uber-elite, directly or indirectly a lot of wealth is held by your average Westerner. 

The concept of government debt is a funny one, on the one hand we do want the state to provide some services as a common good but should we really be using debt to finance it? 

Debt to fund investment is sensible and this should be paid off and not rolled over. War is unfortunate but it has in the past been responsibly for a lot of debt.

Obviously, you'd be insane to write an essay for a Reddit comment. 

&gt;Debt is a ""promise to pay"" at some point in the future. Yes, fiat money is not backed by anything physical and is an abstract concept something which seems to upset a lot of people but the currency is basically a statement of faith in the country, its legal system and prospects.

&gt;Add in issues like inflation, economic growth and purchasing power and the layman is quickly whisked away from what is a comfortable ""[I] can touch this"" thing to basically magic.

Yes. It is exactly magic. The layman sees it but the expert does not. The money system is a philosophical construct. 

&gt;Assuming that we accept (I appreciate that you may not) a fiat monetary system is an acceptable means of transferring the concept of value then the debt is as real as anything.

It's a system we made up and when it causes more harm than good we can make up another system. At least we should be able to because we are intelligent beings with the capacity to organise our societies using creativity, reason and feeling. 

Maybe it's as real as anything but anything is not that real if you think about it honestly (Insert link to Terrence McKenna, Robert Anton Wilson, Phil Dick, Vonnegut, as desired). What part of our construct allows the most people to make the best of their bizarre existence on Earth? 

&gt;Debt is rolled over only insofar as the owner of the debt has faith that the profit in generating revenue from that debt exceeds the profit to be gained in doing something else, or that it helps them meet an obligation.

&gt;Take pension funds who are often holders of a lot of debt, they hold these bonds which are perceived as low risk in order to satisfy the future calls on their revenue streams. This is the main reason there is a direct link between annuity rates and interest rates.

I have not studied economics so there is an inherent obstruction insofar as I can't offer a credible critique to anyone who thinks that expertixe in this matter is essential to comprehension. 

Also, you don't want to write an essay so my question does not demand a comprehensive answer: 

What about this really has any importance? If the system is destroying the ecosphere, forcing people to become poor (which is an inevitable consequence of lending-at-interest) and causing social unrest, change the fucking thing. 

We can make cool things and give everyone a place to live and even kill each other, if we like, without needing a money-as-debt system. 

&gt;We need to stop thinking as everyone who holds financial assets as some uber-elite, directly or indirectly a lot of wealth is held by your average Westerner.

Your average Westerner is an uber-elite. I am at the lower levels of the British economy yet I am (just) in the top 10% of global income. I want for nothing even as I live in fear of the next gas bill. 

&gt;The concept of government debt is a funny one, on the one hand we do want the state to provide some services as a common good but should we really be using debt to finance it?

Well, if you accept the existing system, debt is creating money. You need debt to grow. Mr. Keen, to whom I linked before, explained that public debt is a much less serious problem than private debt. 

&gt;Debt to fund investment is sensible and this should be paid off and not rolled over. War is unfortunate but it has in the past been responsibly for a lot of debt.

Depends what you mean by investment. Whatever money system you develop, it makes sense to invest resources in cool ideas, infrastructure, food, housing, sewage, sex drugs and rock 'n' roll but in our current system investment often means the very super rich printing money for themselves and little else. The banking system could be removed and you could find great ways to stimulate good things using our capacity for ""innovation"" which everyone goes on and on about. Innovation can mean innovating a more positive economic system, greater equality, ways to work with less energy or a new napkin-folding pattern.

In order to offset the ensuing lack of competitiveness, developed nations switched to a consumption-based economy financed by debt (because they could no longer compete on exports). Easy money (cheap debt) led to imbalance and malinvestment.

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Yes. It is exactly magic. The layman sees it but the expert does not. The money system is a philosophical construct.

So much wrapped up here it's worth exploring.

You're spot on, economic systems *are* philosophical constructs. The basic premise is simple ""how do we manage a finite number of scarce resources?""

Is a doctor a magician? What differentiates a medical doctor from a witch doctor? Both promise you that you'll feel better if you drink their respective potions.

Financiers (and yes you may say I am being generous here) are skilled engineers in the same way doctors are. By using mathemtical constructs they are able to determine the risk associated with financial products - read resources - and thereby determine how to allocate them efficiently. 

This is not an exact science and it is far from perfect, but treating all bankers as criminals is both disingenuous and equal to treating a doctor with the backing of scientific method as equal to a witch doctor practising vodoo.

And to quote Arthur C Clarke - ""sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""

The general layman typically has a poor grasp on mathemtics as it is, yet we expect them to understand economic theories and minutiae when they do not have the tools. We do not expect a layman to understand electronics to the level needed to fabricate microchips.

This is not to say the world of finance hasn't gone too far or been exploitative.

So moving back to the philosophy....

&gt; At least we should be able to because we are intelligent beings with the capacity to organise our societies using creativity, reason and feeling. 

Do we really? In the relative blink of an eye we've gone from hunting and clubbing animals to death and dying because of an open wound to shepherding animals in to rooms for slaughter on an industrial scale and having an average life expectancy far beyond what even our recent predecessors could have dreamt of.

Like it or not we are still selfish creatures intent on our own survival. The acquisition of resources for safety and security drive us, as does the desire to attract a mate and procreate. 

Agricultural advancements and industrialisation have given us the skills and means to change how we allocate our time (itself a scarce resource). 

One drum often beat is that we need to ""make more stuff"" usually referring to heavy industry. How idiotic is that? The advancements of our society were not made by beating metal repeatedly until it magically turned itself in to a boat. 

Our society advanced because we have been able to say to certain people ""you sit there and discover crap while the rest of us are beating metal and farming the food"". Yes we need industry to make things but wealth does not stem from beating metal. See the economic breakdown of an iPad.

My humble opinion:

Not going to happen. Not this way, anyway. Germany's primary energy usage is 450 GW (expressed as the average power consumption). Now, if we say that renewables already cover 50 GW (afaik, they don't), we'd have to convert 400 GW to clean energy in less than 40 years. That's 10 GW a year. To put that in perspective, that would be 10 new nukes a year. But we don't build those anymore, so what is it in photovoltaics? About 1000 km^2 + storage (10^3 km^2 would be 2x the world PV production capacity). Or up to 10000 large (off-shore) wind turbines a year. Again, plus storage. These numbers can be reduced by combining the technologies, but not by orders of magnitude.

(The numbers for renewables appear larger because one has to compensate for weather effects by building more capacity. PV in Germany, for example, only produces electricity for ~32 days straight every year.)

As you can imagine, we are not building up to 1000 km^2 of PV every year, nor 10000 wind turbines. Of course, we can hope for significant power savings and increases in efficiency... but they would have to be *substantial*. And the rest of the world must not try the same, because we might not be able to satisfy everyone.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You're spot on, economic systems are philosophical constructs. The basic premise is simple ""how do we manage a finite number of scarce resources?""

How do you get that? I think the basic premise is ""how do we seize as much of the planet's wealth for ourselves as we can?""

&gt;Is a doctor a magician? What differentiates a medical doctor from a witch doctor? Both promise you that you'll feel better if you drink their respective potions.

There is probably a lot less that differentiates these that is generally perceived.

&gt;Financiers (and yes you may say I am being generous here) are skilled engineers in the same way doctors are. By using mathemtical constructs they are able to determine the risk associated with financial products - read resources - and thereby determine how to allocate them efficiently.

I think they have made you believe this but where on earth is the evidence that that's what they do?I think this is just propaganda. Allocation of resources is a product of raw power. The British had an empire at the beginning of the age of industry and went and seized as many resources for the betterment of themselves as possible until their power faded away in favour of the US empire. The money system is part of the toolset used to seize these resources but you wouldn't say a saw designs and builds your garden shed. 

&gt;This is not an exact science and it is far from perfect, but treating all bankers as criminals is both disingenuous and equal to treating a doctor with the backing of scientific method as equal to a witch doctor practising vo[o]doo.

There are plenty of sources suggesting that economists are worse than witch doctors. I suspect this is right since a witch doctor should at least have their patients' interests at heart and is invariably accountable to them. Economists, it seems to me, are totally disconnected from the reality of life on Earth. I can't back this up empirically, of course. 

&gt;And to quote Arthur C Clarke - ""sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""

And you could probably write an essay on what this could mean. 

&gt;The general layman typically has a poor grasp on mathemtics as it is, yet we expect them to understand economic theories and minutiae when they do not have the tools. We do not expect a layman to understand electronics to the level needed to fabricate microchips.

Yes, this is an inevitable product of complex systems. The microchip designers don't understand nuclear power and the mathematicians don't understand permaculture and so on. 

The layman can tell if the microchips are causing something bad to happen and say - *I don't want these microchips to keep doing that any more* or *I don't want microchips at all*.

&gt;This is not to say the world of finance hasn't gone too far or been exploitative.

The world of finance is at source a negative force which will always be exploitative at least since Venetian banks realised they could lend ten bits of paper representing one lump of gold and only be in possession of one lump of gold. 

&gt;Do we really? Etc....

I was being semi-sarcastic. These are qualities we seem very quick to attribute to ourselves. Of course we are the same balding monkeys that roamed the African savannah not 200,000 years ago. Of course most of us are unable to deal with the insane complexity of modern civilisation. It's out of control and we are committing suicide as a consequence because the mass operates separately from the individual, apart from anything else. 


&gt;Like it or not we are still selfish creatures intent on our own survival. The acquisition of resources for safety and security drive us, as does the desire to attract a mate and procreate.

I don't think this is true. There is plenty of evidence that cooperation is as natural and useful as competition if not more so. The influential political, philosophical and cultural forces which are dominated by selfish and competitive people have you believing this is ""nature"" but it is merely a matter of choosing to focus on one aspect of our natures. Prior to agricultural civilisation we were likely cooperative, generous and helpful and had little or no sense of mine and yours. 

&gt;Agricultural advancements and industrialisation have given us the skills and means to change how we allocate our time (itself a scarce resource).

So that most of us are slaves to a mortgage, day-job, technology and pollution? So that gardening is now a hobby you do after work instead of a way of life? 

&gt;One drum often beat is that we need to ""make more stuff"" usually referring to heavy industry. How idiotic is that? The advancements of our society were not made by beating metal repeatedly until it magically turned itself in to a boat.

This is indeed idiotic. 

&gt;Our society advanced because we have been able to say to certain people ""you sit there and discover crap while the rest of us are beating metal and farming the food"". Yes we need industry to make things but wealth does not stem from beating metal. See the economic breakdown of an iPad.

When has such a thing ever happened? I can't imagine the civilisation of the Indus valley included a referendum in which everyone agreed that the majority would toil for a living while a selected few would get a workshop in which to be a mad inventor. Where do you get this from? [EDIT: It's more likely that some beings decided to use force to get control over agricultural land and make people work there for food while they got to enjoy the wealth that came with the surplus created by others.] There is too much weirdness revealed here, companero. The perception that society advanced in a linear fashion from one convenient technology to the next is bonkers, with all due respect. 

The iPad is a high class Fisher Price toy for the rich to fawn over while 90% of the world has not enough and doesn't have an opportunity to make the best out of their lives and talents. It is nothing more than the product of abuse. Of course we spoiled modern Westerners would produce these toys, it's fun. But it has very little value so long as it is built on wage slavery and inequality.

First one that comes to mind: ***stop asking questions in this retarded way.*** Honestly, is this a plan to decieve thought?

Each country has its situation to be examined individually, duh. This isn't the US.

That aside, clearly these ""austerity"" measures are to favour the ones that hold the big debt instead of the good of the nations. You have to stimulate the economy **first**, then tax what happens second. Cutting welfare is only gonna put so much money in the governments' pockets, but it's not an investment. If by ""austerity"" you mean following the rules then good luck teaching a mule rocket science.

So what you *basically*, generally speaking you'd have to do is create more jobs (even in the public sector of course) so people can have said jobs with wich they pay taxes, spend in turn and in the meantime have a decent lifetime. This could mean *less* taxes sometimes, as people must have the opportunity to start a business if constant flow of wealth is to be generated. Economics 101 really, nothing new.

But that would be in the common man's interest! Let's instead tax the already poor the crap outta them, cut them services and the opportunity to make something out of themselves (oh yeah cut education while you're at it) so goverments have their ""balance in order"" (lmao) and debts can keep on piliing up interest. Remember, safety of the investors first!

But it's ok, it's understandable that in times of economic shits like these everyone's an expert economist. As soon as people get a job they'll go back (if they've ever stopped in the first place) drinking heavily at the first chance and see what celebrities are doing.

Same thing different wording. 

&gt; I think they have made you believe this but where on earth is the evidence that that's what they do?

If you are sufficiently well versed in reading and mathematics then it is all there is economics text books.

&gt;  Allocation of resources is a product of raw power.

Absolutely, but as you later note we do try to have some sort of communal division - those in power do throw bits tot he rest of us. Whatever system you choose there will always be the concept of power - please feel free to suggest one that doesn't.

&gt; The layman can tell if the microchips are causing something bad to happen and say - I don't want these microchips to keep doing that any more or I don't want microchips at all.

I bet they can't, though irritatingly I am struggling to think of a good example right now.

&gt; The world of finance is at source a negative force which will always be exploitative at least since Venetian banks realised they could lend ten bits of paper representing one lump of gold and only be in possession of one lump of gold. 

Finance is a force like any other it can be used for good or bad. If you do not have the power/resources/money to acquire something that is critical for you but a bank/person/friend is able to provide you with the resources then it is a force for good is it not?

&gt; There is plenty of evidence that cooperation is as natural and useful as competition if not more so.

Of course it is, but as numerous studies of animals has shown cooperation is generally fine as it gives one power over another or offers a perceived benefit (this may not be an actual benefit). Things are done selflessly, but not often.

&gt; had little or no sense of mine and yours. 

Even groups of primates have distinct hierarchies and everyone knows where they fit in. Ok, it may be stretching it to say that one monkey owns a rock but other things such as mating rights are brutally enforced.

&gt; So that most of us are slaves to a mortgage, day-job, technology and pollution? So that gardening is now a hobby you do after work instead of a way of life? 

We are slaves to existance. We need to eat and drink at least. Maslow went one further and gave us a pyramid of needs and although I think he was not very good he does have a point.

What should we be slaves to? Nothing? Where does our food come from? Grow your own is fine to a point but that's basically back to subsistence farming. You can forget about all the higher tech stuff we have.

&gt; When has such a thing ever happened? I can't imagine the civilisation of the Indus valley included a referendum in which everyone agreed that the majority would toil for a living while a selected few would get a workshop in which to be a mad inventor.

Of course it is not linear, I was simplifying greatly. It has happened by virtue of those in power having - through accident or design - spare resources such that some of the populace with sufficient resources were able to devote free time to other things.

I seriously doubt Isaac Newton was farming every day and devoting an hour every other evening to research. 

&gt; The iPad is a high class Fisher Price toy for the rich to fawn over while 90% of the world has not enough and doesn't have an opportunity to make the best out of their lives and talents.

Indeed, and the economic breakdown is interesting because that is reflects in the value chain. $8 of the retail price is kept in china for manufacture the rest of the overpriced thing is the perceived value of the designers and everyone else.

Die Bezeichnung „Freiberufler“ bezieht sich hingegen immer auf Angehörige ganz bestimmter Berufe, nämlich der Freiberufe (Architekten, Ärzte, Rechtsanwälte, Steuerberater usw.), sie sagt nichts aus über die Art des Beschäftigungsverhältnisses (ein Freiberufler kann auch weisungsgebundener Arbeitnehmer sein).

So a ""Freiberufler"" can work completely independently (selbständig) or as a ""freier Mitarbeiter"". Both scenarios are sometimes called Freelancer in Germany.

Before anyone tries to make the argument, yes, we are invited over as repeat guests, yes, we only tend to consort with clean and tidy people, and no, our bathrooms are not spattered with urine.  If I ever had a guest who was such a pig, I would not invite him back.  Easy, and far less bizarre in my mind than pre-emptively lecturing someone on how they should use the toilet.  I view that as strange and borderline obsessive-compulsive.  

As we're talking about personal opinions, I also can't help but also find it more than a little smug and self-righteous - ""oh, you don't do something in a way that I approve of?  Ew.""

Honestly though, while I understand that people don't find cleaning toilets to be pleasant, I find the thought of not regularly cleaning your bathroom to be far more revolting.  Not to mention that, if you don't close the toilet lid while flushing, complaining about pee is pretty silly.

Learn to aim and urinate without splashing.  Yes, it is possible.  If you want technical details, pull back your foreskin for a better stream, aim at a steep part of the bowl to avoid splashing, push up underneath your balls when done, and wipe with paper instead of shaking it.  There.  Easy.  Don't people's parents teach them these things?

On solar, commercial panels are still a way away from the initial limit (Shockley-Queisser), and that limit is surmountable using layers to break up high energy or combine low energy photons, or by using multijunction devices. Moreover, the majority of the cost of the panels is the silicon, so there is a lot of scope for finding cheaper ways of producing it, or reducing the width of the silicon layer by using engineered reflective surfaces, or simply switching to other materials. I think we'll continue to see costs drop for a while yet by the 8% a year which has been the recent trend.

true,socrates28,null,null,"Austerity for me makes no sense in a time of recession, however austerity makes perfect sense in a time of economic boom. Something to the same effect was said by [Obama](http://atlanticsentinel.com/2012/02/obama-administration-says-time-for-austerity-not-now/). 

Let me explain as I learnt it in one of my classes. To put it simply, in a time of recession it is only the government that is left with the resources and money to spend in order to get out of a recession. Particularly spending on those necessary services such as eduction, welfare, and healthcare. These services offer a cushion to families that have been heavily affected by the recession (i.e. unemployed). With the loss of income their spending either contracts or becomes reoriented to necessities. At the same time banks were hit heavily and required massive bailouts, the housing market collapsed, and US car makers were hit. So in both cases you have less spending, well the only entity left with the money to spend and by doing so giving the private sector and public time to recuperate safely and take over spending once they are in a better position. If the government doesn't spend then no one is helped, money is not being pumped into the economy, and everything just falls apart. Which is worrying for Greece considering they are implementing some pretty harsh austerity measures, but the blow is at least cushioned by the bailouts. However, austerity could potentially affect the economy in the long term simply by never giving the chance for each sector to recover and so though there may no longer be a recession, but the economy is still weaker when compared to a pre-recession boom. 

Consider for instance students as a social class. Well cutting into education has some pretty big ramifications for students and their future, and in my opinion if there is one place governments don't spend enough on is post-secondary education. Generally to go to university or college requires a lot of capital, which an 18 year old does not have, and there isn't a big opportunity to wait for the capital (because at minimum wage it will take a long time to save up for all the years of schooling especially if the student has to live on their own). Add to this, for some disciplines if you wait too long, the window of opportunity for getting a decent job can be significantly reduced. So the 18 year old feels pressured to go immediately or within the next couple of years to college, they can't afford it and so take out loans. They graduate and have difficulties finding a job because of the market, but they still have loans. These loans become debt with interest and cut into the amount of cash available for spending. They then spend the next years working off their debt, delaying their contributions to the market. So if a 22 year old graduate has to wait until 30 or 35 before they can start buying things they like well that's 8-13 years of lost profit from that individual. If that individual was to buy an iPhone at 22, making a decent living, they would be able to make multiple upgrades so they could potentially buy 3-4 or more or less iPhones over 13 years. With debt they may not even buy an iPhone at all. But we tell them to be more responsible, support themselves fully (i.e. don't expect handouts), and contribute to the economy, but with a ""Oh, by the way, now that I am retiring you gotta support me too!"" mentality. Increase austerity, you increase this burden on students and in the end screw up the next cadres of employees and consumers. The idea is that students are looked down upon as parasites on the state rather than as a future pillar supporting the state that just needs to be built. We apply it to the poor as well, and have no patience to better their situation, so when each solution inevitably fails we view them as hopeless. This does not change when the middle class becomes poor due to a recession, and so we are not willing to help them out at all. 

And this is the problem of austerity, it represents the mentality I have described above. We developed a myth of where lack of wealth automatically attributed to laziness so the way to become wealthy is discipline and austerity. The problem is that we view poverty as a personal failing only, and absolve society, politics, etc. of all responsibility; meaning the problem is never solved and the poor are always poor.",0,1335449999,null,0,false,0,c4guccz,t3_staqt,t1_c4guccz,t3_staqt,null,1428800562,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Nope, it just switches jobs from one sector to another. The tertiary sector of the economy has been growing since there is less need for people working in the primary and secondary sectors due to advancements in technology/efficiency. In the future you will just have more people dedicated to creative jobs instead of manual ones, that does not negate the existence of jobs in the future, it just means they will be more service oriented.

&gt;I'd say ""look where it's got us"". We seem to be in a complete mess.

Yes we are, but even in our mess we still live better than the average joe a hundred years ago. Besides, the reason we are in a mess is not because of capitalism, but rather the lack of it. We have chosen centrally planned economies over the wisdom of the free market and thus ended up with a mutated form of capitalism.

&gt;I don't like to sound condescending but it sounds like you're set in your opinions and unwilling to stand for anything but the norm. What exactly about my idealistic view of the future was it you took stance against?

I believe we will always need capitalism and money, even in a world where machines are responsible for all the work. You will always need those two to allocate resources in the most useful way, unless we reach a stage where we can fully manipulate matter, and thus have nearly infinite resources. But by the time we reach such a point we will be transhumans, so it's of little importance to us right now to look so far in the future.",0,1335450519,null,0,false,0,c4gufzm,t3_staqt,t1_c4gufzm,t1_c4gu69z,null,1428800614,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt;If I am insufficiently educated in mathematics then I don't get to opine about it? In which case, any system too complicated to understand should be violently abolished. 

&gt;Absolutely, but as you later note we do try to have some sort of communal division - those in power do throw bits tot he rest of us. 

Enough to avoid the noose. Are you satisfied with this? 


&gt;Whatever system you choose there will always be the concept of power - please feel free to suggest one that doesn't.

This seems to be true but it's, thus far, a matter of degree. But we are free to evolve. There are plenty of ideas and implementations of systems in which power is controlled (geddit?) and limited. We need to increase in wisdom, I think, to make such things work on a large scale but if you are interested Ivan Ilyich, Charles Eisenstein, David Graeber, Peter Gelderloos all have interesting stuff to say about this, there are tons of proposals and people creating alternative communities within the existing system. 

&gt;I bet they can't, though irritatingly I am struggling to think of a good example right now.

I mean the products of what microchips do. I can oppose the electronic trading systems in the financial markets because they concentrate power in the hands of the few. I don't have to understand electronics to be right. I can be in favour of discouraging people from using their Walkmans while driving, I don't have to understand the mechanism. 

&gt;Finance is a force like any other it can be used for good or bad. 

Surely you want to distinguish between a force of nature about which we can do very little other than learn the best way to live with it and a human invented system. Finance (assuming you mean the economic system) is a construction which suits a minority. It's inherent to the system. I would have a system which benefits the majority better than by letting them have the crumbs from the table. 

&gt;If you do not have the power/resources/money to acquire something that is critical for you but a bank/person/friend is able to provide you with the resources then it is a force for good is it not?

Due to being stuck within a capitalist money-based economy I have few choices as far as many resources are concerned. I limit my dependence as best I can but I am here. In a different system, I wouldn't depend on money or currency. I am, at present, forced to demand financial compensation for sing my skills to help others but I would be happier not to. I do work for free when I can and am often happy to barter if it's possible. 


&gt;Of course it is, but as numerous studies of animals has shown cooperation is generally fine as it gives one power over another or offers a perceived benefit (this may not be an actual benefit). Things are done selflessly, but not often.

I was thinking about human societies. In tribal systems there are hierarchies but power is as much a burden as a boon. There is certainly not a situation where a small clique owns 99% of resources while the rest of the tribe starve. For most of human history we probably shared everything and worked together at least within tribal groups. If there were dominant beings with power over others it was nowhere near as absurd as what we have today. If hierarchies are inevitable, we should use them only insofar as it benefits the many. It needs people who know what's going on and who will not obey disproportionate power. Sadly our present society has created a very ignorant population. 


&gt;Even groups of primates have distinct hierarchies and everyone knows where they fit in. Ok, it may be stretching it to say that one monkey owns a rock but other things such as mating rights are brutally enforced.

This is not an area I know much about. I feel skeptical about animal research I have read about because our base presumptions are so very flawed I can't imagine we can judge too well. I don't know. 


&gt;We are slaves to exist[e]nce. We need to eat and drink at least. Maslow went one further and gave us a pyramid of needs and although I think he was not very good he does have a point.

&gt;What should we be slaves to? Nothing? Where does our food come from? Grow your own is fine to a point but that's basically back to subsistence farming. 

The pyramid of needs is obvious. I don't know anything about Maslow. Ultimately we *are* slaves to existence but there are degrees of slavery. Would you accept being a slave in the way that Africans were in America, based on this logic?? I guess not. Would you prefer to be a slave to whatever you are doing now than to Foxconn? I guess yes. I can't not be a slave to existence but I can own myself and my relationships with society (although, we mustn't forget the self is illusory anyway).

&gt;You can forget about all the higher tech stuff we have.

Where is your imagination and vision? We can have high tech stuff without money. The threat to industrial civilisation is that environmental collapse and economic collapse will pull the rug from under our feet before we can do anything about it. 



&gt;Of course it is not linear, I was simplifying greatly. It has happened by virtue of those in power having - through accident or design - spare resources such that some of the populace with sufficient resources were able to devote free time to other things.

But it could also happen without gangsterism. Just because something happened does not mean we have to keep on going the same way. 

&gt;I seriously doubt Isaac Newton was farming every day and devoting an hour every other evening to research. 

We know he wasn't. 

&gt;Indeed, and the economic breakdown is interesting because that is reflects in the value chain. $8 of the retail price is kept in china for manufacture the rest of the overpriced thing is the perceived value of the designers and everyone else. 

And this is all controlled by the military power of the US and its lackeys like Britain. And the Chinese are controlled by their authoritarian system.  It has nothing to do with money controlling access to resources. Money can be eliminated and this abuse can continue or it could be eliminated and abuse can be minimised. Money is not real and none of the shit that's going on NEEDS money to happen. 

It's just a game. 

&gt;There is no such thing as true equality. The concepts of equality of outcome and equality of opportunity are mutually exclusive.

Is this all we can imagine? ""True"" equality or brutal abuse? Come on, motherfucker. 

You will never be equal to me in drumming. I will never be equal to you in whatever you do. But we can be equal in our ability to live somewhere and share the resources and technology that we need to meet our basic needs without being caught up in a system of a few huge winners and many losers.

So after using one of the toilets over here, I've heard Americans say things like ""I feel bad for the cleaning lady who has to clean that bowl from the shit sliding down the side"" and I was a little shocked.

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; If I am insufficiently educated in mathematics then I don't get to opine about it? In which case, any system too complicated to understand should be violently abolished. 

Feel free to opine but you should not be surprised if your opinion should is given less value than someone else better educated. At least in my mind. 

And I dont restrict this to mathematics. I'd sooner trust a doctor and trained medical practictioner to come up with sensible opinions on medicine rather than an alcoholic who hasn't been sober in 10 years.

This will crop up later but the scale of human knowledge is increasingly specialised to the point where that unless you take a reasonable amount of effort a layman cannot reasonably be expected to make a balanced or reasoned viewpoint. There is much in science that is counter-intuitive for example.

&gt; But we are free to evolve. There are plenty of ideas and implementations of systems in which power is controlled (geddit?) and limited.

Power is never controlled simply moved. I cant remember where I read it - it may have been Terry Pratchett - but simply put a system works insofar as people believe in the system, the minute that belief goes then the whole thing crumbles. 

Going back to what you said about groups and co-operation, society has formed groups around shared access to resources ""I work for/with Person A because they enable me to have access to more resources than if I worked with Person B"". That may beg the question of how Person A and B are in a position to allocate more resources to Person C but we'll leave that for the time being.

&gt; I would have a system which benefits the majority better than by letting them have the crumbs from the table. 

Which system(s) truly allow this? And here I presume you mean the majority of the global population rather than simply poor Westerners.

&gt; There is certainly not a situation where a small clique owns 99% of resources while the rest of the tribe starve.

&gt; I feel skeptical about animal research I have read about because our base presumptions are so very flawed I can't imagine we can judge too well. I don't know. 

Have a look at [this](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347200914714) and [this](http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=t6262j1j1160t962&amp;size=largest). They are only summaries but clearly describe that there exists an element of competition between animals for food. This is to be expected when food is in short supply. 

So, no maybe 99% of an animal group will control food but lets be clear that there is an element of competition and these animals are not living some hippy nirvana. 

Yes we may not fully understand the motives but some behaviour is clear in intent i.e. the dominance of a group.

&gt; I can't not be a slave to existence but I can own myself and my relationships with society (although, we mustn't forget the self is illusory anyway).

Ok, so what is it to ""own oneself""? do you mean the absolute freedom to do whatever you want come what may? Or do you mean the freedom to act within the constraints of society?

If the former then surely you are aware of the concept of public goods and the freerdier problem?

If the latter then with a bit of planning and forethought you can have what you want. If you dislike society then so be it, but you have quite a lot of freedom. Especially if you are fortunate to be living in the West.

&gt; Where is your imagination and vision? We can have high tech stuff without money.

I never said we couldn't. I expressed myself poorly I am sorry.

What I mean is that the increased specialisation that is needed to organise hi-tech products requires a degree of skill and investment (in education etc) money - or some equivalent concept - enables us to have a means of exchange which is universally accepted. The division and specialisation of labour is critical to higher tech society.

&gt; But it could also happen without gangsterism. Just because something happened does not mean we have to keep on going the same way. 

Indeed, but again let's pick a system or 2 and debate them. There are flaws with the status quo and frankly I don't like it much either but I have yet to see a system which would be much different in substance to what we have now - again ""the king is dead long live the king"" we'd be replacing one elite for another. 

&gt; It has nothing to do with money controlling access to resources. Money can be eliminated and this abuse can continue or it could be eliminated and abuse can be minimised. Money is not real and none of the shit that's going on NEEDS money to happen. 

Again, I explained myself poorly. The point was about value - real or perceived - not about money. Money is a simple means of exchange. 1 token buys 1 bread. Value means that 1 bread is worth 1 token but 1 house is worth 10 tokens.

&gt; ""True"" equality or brutal abuse? Come on, motherfucker. 

pfft, do you really mean equality or do you mean to drag everyone down to some lowest common denominator? If you pick equality of outcome then you get a lot of pissed off people who miss out. Pick equality of opportunity then you have to accept people will achieve different things and guess what pissed off people. 

So what do you do? Try and balance the two no doubt. That is what we do. What is your version of ""equality""?

&gt; we need to meet our basic needs without being caught up in a system of a few huge winners and many losers. 

The basic needs of many are met the number in absolute poverty is significantly less than the population of the [world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty#Absolute_poverty) - being generous only some 20% of the global population is in absolute poverty. 

Don't get me wrong that is a lot of people but there are a lot of winners there.

But austerity can also mean that you check the areas where you spend money, if there is any possibility to do the same with less money, i.e. to be more efficient.

true,tugasnake,PORT,Portugal,"&gt;How is this going to work? There is a genuine need for manual work at the moment as we need manual labour to generate a whole host of essential things for ourselves.

I never said there is no need for manual work ಠ_ಠ

&gt; There is no need for creative work at all, if everybody is satiated in their needs by being cared for, fed and looked after then why the need to hold on to antiquated ideals like capitalism and money?

No need for creative work? Tell that to the millions of artists who love what they do and produce entertainment and culture. Creative jobs are the best and in the future people will be free to pursue what they like since capitalism and money have allowed civilization to grow past the point where most of the population needs to be involved in agriculture.

&gt;The free market is what leads to capitalism which leads to this ideal that ""one must work to generate money, the more one works and the harder the more one earns"" which I don't see why we would hold on to. The person who enjoys the job that they do is few and far between, basically we're slaves to the the big society which expects of us that we bow down and do as we're bid. Are you averse to the idea of not working for purely an increase in money or an increase in power (arguably the same thing)?

Profit is a incentive to work, if only the people who enjoy their jobs worked we would'nt be discussing this in here because there would not even be a electric grid. It was capitalism that allowed parents to let their children go to school instead of working with them, it was capitalism that allowed working conditions to become better, it will be capitalism that will lead to a world where most manual work is done by machines, freeing humans to pursue their interests instead of working in a factory or doing some other repetitive boring job.

&gt;Letting the market be 100% I hypothesize would lead to one hyper-company ruling the entire globe. We already have multi-nationals which are so incredibly powerful as to be basically untouchable. I don't like this and neither should anybody. Wealth should be spread. Well, wealth should not mean ""how much money you have"" but should instead mean ""how much you get out of life"" or something along those lines. A wealthy man would be one who gets a lot out of life, is happy rather than the current terminology being one who is rich.

Your logic does not explain the rise and fall of companies. Companies grow and fall, on a long enough timeline they all go bankrupt. No company will ever be able to become the dominant one in a free market. Those untouchable multi-nationals are so because they have the support of governments, in the free market they are subject to the consumers and must please them if they wish to remain in business.

&gt;I can not guess, but yes you would require something to stop a single malicious person from taking over the globe.

No person/company/country will ever take the globe. Some countries may seem to have come close but even they had their limits and their time. In the end power is constantly switching around, no one can come close to grabbing it all, much less forever.

1. Habits are generally things people *do*. Having more or less water in a toilet bowl is not a habit  - it is, as you mentioned, a technical issue. However, I've never heard anyone but Germans comment on our toilets. For the sake of this argument, I do believe that Germans are on the outside of this one. Toilet bowl design is moderately standard, at least in any of the countries I've been to through-out North America and Europe. But Germany is the country everyone remembers because of the ""poop shelf"". And most new toilets in America are water-saving and it's becoming much more socially pressured to have eco-friendly plumbing, gadgets, appliance, etc. So while our toilets may not ever look like yours here, they are becoming just as water efficient. 

2. I have seen rather disgusting public toilets in Germany as well. Sure, it's a nice idea to think everyone is polite enough to clean up after themselves, but ideal is not standard. My Gastvater couldn't wipe his own ass to save his life. Not all German families are raised the same. So I'm sorry your roommate is messy, but he is not and should not be taken for your whole perspective on American bathroom hygiene and technique. Yes, men there generally stand up. My father doesn't (this was not the happiest day of my life finding that one out). 

3. Wiping too hard generally has more to do with the roughness of toilet paper. You can't tell me you've never had a sore anus from having diarrhea or the like. I have never had a 'bleeding when wiping' problem, but I like to use baby wipes in certain situations. I have found German toilet paper to be, on the whole, much larger per sheet than American TP and mostly softer. I haven't ever compared prices, so I can't relate quality/cheapness.

No it is *not*.

This is like when the conservatives in the U.S. refer to the very wealthy as ""job creators"" in order to justify not raising taxes on them and even giving them *more* tax breaks than what they have.

""Austerity"", as I perceive it being used in Europe right now, means making the 99% pay for the mess that the 1% made (sorry, I'm going to use that ""99%"" thing, I know it's a cliche at this point, but in this case it's the best way I can explain this).

Now of course the original designers of the pension system had thought this too. Everything would have gone smoothly by the next generation always covering the previous one, however when people started to have smaller number babies, the next generation wasn't big enough to cover the last, thus enlarging the funding gap even more.

Luckily our state did note this a decade ago and made pension reforms that has already lowered current and future pensions, however those probably haven't been enough and future cuts need to be made to make the system sustainable. Unfortunately this really doesn't help my generation, we have to work harder, pay more and retire later: I just got calculation from my pension fund and with my current income level I can afford to comfortably retire at 68.",0,1335460480,null,0,false,0,c4gwk12,t3_staqt,t1_c4gwk12,t1_c4gt0mg,null,1428801697,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I think some of the conditions and pace of austerity is might be a little too tough (such as the deficit limit) and that cutting during economically difficult times can often prolong them and result in the deficit not being sufficiently tackled (as a result of loss of tax receipts/increase in welfare ect). 

Most successful deficit reduction programs involve 85% spending cuts matched with 15% in tax rises, the heart of reducing your deficit is through spending cuts (although as mentioned earlier it can potentially harm growth if handled badly). Unfortunately in order to make any meaningful cuts you have to reduce spending on big ticket items such as welfare/defence/education ect, if you choose to protect one department you will have to further decrease other departments. 

I don't think I'm qualified to give an opinion on what the exact solution should be but governments do need to make sure to maintain confidence so that they can finance their budgets without increasing their national debt/deficit too much.

**Part I**


&gt;Feel free to opine but you should not be surprised if your opinion should is given less value than someone else better educated. At least in my mind.


My opinion might be given less value by those conditioned to certain beliefs and it might be given more value by those who are not conditioned. (For clarity, I understand ""my"" opinion is a convenience. I have opinions that leech out of the culture just as do yours.)

Whether or not you think it, I don't need to understand the mechanics of the system, a dead fish told me about it. 

&gt;And I don[']t restrict this to mathematics. I'd sooner trust a doctor and trained medical practitioner to come up with sensible opinions on medicine rather than an alcoholic who hasn't been sober in 10 years.

What a strange comparison. And yet, if the doctor has interests beyond providing you healthcare, like paying off his sports car, he might be tempted to offer you something you don't need or something harmful. Maybe an alcoholic would be better suited to advise you in some situations. I know alcoholics who are never drunk although they can't be said to be sober. How much trust do you give doctors anyway? They are reckless self-serving lunatics. The are drug addicts, they are egomaniacs. Maybe you should compare a doctor and a shaman. Maybe the doctor would prescribe Seroxat which will make you kill your wife and the shaman will prescribe mushrooms that make you see how one second is an eternity and life is bliss. I know I'd prefer a doctor to sort me out after a car crash but there is a lot they don't know too much about no matter what you think they know due to education. Even  a narrow minded, straight laced-person like Ben Goldacre tells us enough about shoddy research, shoddy interpretation of data, corruption in the creation of medicines. The truth is we don't know what a doctor can do a lot of the time. Maybe you are a scientist, maybe you know something about your field but what do you know about other fields? Howabout some context? Maybe the ten-year alcoholic is a fucking doctor. They often are. 

&gt;This will crop up later but the scale of human knowledge is increasingly specialised to the point where that unless you take a reasonable amount of effort a layman cannot reasonably be expected to make a balanced or reasoned viewpoint. There is much in science that is counter-intuitive for example.

Again, you seem to be implying that not understanding the mechanics means we shouldn't comment. I disagree. Science is a belief system. I know the car works and the TV. But I don't really know about Monsanto and I don't have to to know they are dangerous. I don't have to know exactly how nuclear powerplants work to know the are dangerous. I know enough. You know enough. 

You want to believe? Good for you. We all want to believe something but let's not get too caught up in it. 

&gt;Power is never controlled simply moved. I cant remember where I read it - it may have been Terry Pratchett - but simply put a system works insofar as people believe in the system, the minute that belief goes then the whole thing crumbles.

Yes, this is what I was saying about the financial system. It's not real. The money is not real and ultimately whether or not we are in debt isn't important if you realise that we can just change our minds about supporting the system. What's missing from what you said is that the system can collapse from under you. No matter how hard the Egyptians believed in it, the Egyptian civilisation collapsed. Rome collapsed. The British empire collapsed. 

&gt;Going back to what you said about groups and co-operation, society has formed groups around shared access to resources ""I work for/with Person A because they enable me to have access to more resources than if I worked with Person B"". That may beg the question of how Person A and B are in a position to allocate more resources to Person C but we'll leave that for the time being.

You seem to be brushing off abuse, bullying and coercion. Don't you want to do something good with yourself instead of defending the status quo? You want the iPad but you are afraid to think humans are collectively capable of dealing with the burden of existence in a fairer way. Why do you fear this? When you interact with people in your immediate environment do you not practice kindness and expect it in return? Do you not give things, do you not forgive people? Why do you defend a system in which Cameron and Murdoch and Louis Walsh are allowed to be arseholes when you wouldn't put up with their behaviour in the personal sphere? 

&gt;Which system(s) truly allow this? And here I presume you mean the majority of the global population rather than simply poor Westerners.

There are, as I said, plenty of ideas and even implementations which allow it. I suggested sources. Anarchism proposes something I like. But I am not dogmatic about it. It is possible the American Natives lived pretty well. Why not apply their system to the modern world and see what happens? Why not encourage local currencies to augment the national currencies? Why not try different models at once? Why not make gift economies viable? Yes, we are in the globalist trap at the moment but I think this is coming to an end because the system you believe in is coming down whether you believe it or not. I am, as I said, aware that even poor Westerners are well off by comparison with the majority of the world's population. I think that relative poverty is an issue but I can get free healthcare whenever I need it (at least this year if not next) and I know people in poor countries who can't get basic medical problems sorted due to lack of money and resources. 

&gt;Have a look at this and this. They are only summaries but clearly describe that there exists an element of competition between animals for food. This is to be expected when food is in short supply. 

You can read anything about anything. Of course all beings will act differently in times of crisis but a great deal of the time there is not much of a crisis. Most prey animals are not too bothered most of the time, most apes have what they need in their areas. It is when humans encroach that habitats are stressed and tensions arise. I remember reading an anthropology book in which they point out that studies of chimps, for example fail often to take into account that habitats are under threat, their natural living areas are shrinking and conclusions about violence and hierarchies may be distorted by these factors. Humans are pretty stupid. The really stupid ones are those who think their education made them less stupid.  

&gt;So, no maybe 99% of an animal group will control food but lets be clear that there is an element of competition and these animals are not living some hippy nirvana.

Hippy nirvana? 

Try to notice how often you throw out these false dichotomies. It's either enslavement by the capitalist class or hippy nirvana? You are propagandised, comrade. 

&gt;Ok, so what is it to ""own oneself""? do you mean the absolute freedom to do whatever you want come what may? Or do you mean the freedom to act within the constraints of society?

Freedom is meaningless. We negotiate freedom with each other. Sometimes freedom means being as unconstrained as one can be and sometimes freedom is to be held in a rigid framework (a monastery springs to mind). In society freedom must be the ability to make choices but the obligation to minimise harm to others. Unless you're a cunt, of course. 

&gt;If the former then surely you are aware of the concept of public goods and the freerdier problem?

Etc. 

&gt;If the latter then with a bit of planning and forethought you can have what you want. If you dislike society then so be it, but you have quite a lot of freedom. Especially if you are fortunate to be living in the West.

I don't have much freedom because I am a prisoner of the money system. My biggest challenge in life is paying the rent and bills. I think that society should free everyone from this and it could be easily done. But most people are too attached to their slave status and iPads. 

I am extremely fortunate to be in the West. It is luck. The freedom and comfort I enjoy, however, is derived from the brutal oppression of others who are less lucky but no less deserving of the good lifestyle I enjoy. People who have more than I are enjoying vast excess at the expense of others. I know I can lower my lifestyle and still be comfortable. Meanwhile across the world people work 14 hours a day for a pittance to make this laptop and could never afford one.

&gt;What I mean is that the increased specialisation that is needed to organise hi-tech products requires a degree of skill and investment (in education etc) money - or some equivalent concept - enables us to have a means of exchange which is universally accepted. The division and specialisation of labour is critical to higher tech society.

If the price we pay for a high tech society is abuse, pollution and the eventual catastrophic destabilisation of the climate and the death of the oceans, you can stick it up your arse. You think it's important, any of this? It's not. It's fun but that's all. I would ask the people who don't enjoy the benefits but who feel the shitty end of our civilisation what they think. 

Our present system of money is not a means of exchange. The TEM system or the Brixton Puond or the LETS system is a means of exchange. Money is not a means of exchange. It is a means of transferring power and wealth up the chain. If you buy the means of exchange thing, you aren't getting anything. Fractional reserve banking is not required for a means of exchange, neither are shares and credit default swaps or stock markets. You and I might use it as a means of exchange but the government uses it as a means of control and the system uses it as a means to make sure that you are always worried about losing your supper. 


&gt;Indeed, but again let's pick a system or 2 and debate them. There are flaws with the status quo and frankly I don't like it much either but I have yet to see a system which would be much different in substance to what we have now - again ""the king is dead long live the king"" we'd be replacing one elite for another.

I have referred you to a reading list already. David Graeber, Ivan Ilyich, Charles Eisenstein, Morris Berman, Peter Gelderloos, Derrick Jensen (with a pinch of brine, I would suggest), Michel Albert, all the dead anarchists. 

Two systems which appeal to me and which can be implemented within the existing order are the gift-economy and the alternative-currency. A gift economy just means giving stuff to others. We do this all the time anyway. Why not have an economy based on just giving each other stuff (look up also economics of altruism). And with alternative currencies you can find tons of stuff. 

Admittedly, it takes a transformation of perception to get these things off the ground but instead of defending slavery, why not plant some new ideas? Especially if you know that shit is fucked up. 

Replacing one elite with another is a waste of time or at best entertainment and catharsis. It doesn't make sense although I can easily imagine bankers swinging from lampposts in my lifetime and would be inclined to support it if just for a change of pace. 



&gt;Again, I explained myself poorly. The point was about value - real or perceived - not about money. Money is a simple means of exchange. 1 token buys 1 bread. Value means that 1 bread is worth 1 token but 1 house is worth 10 tokens.

This is not true of debt based banking. If we each work an hour and get a token and can exchange the token for something we need, fine but you know that our money doesn't work like that even though it serves that purpose for we little folk. 

&gt;pfft, do you really mean equality or do you mean to drag everyone down to some lowest common denominator? If you pick equality of outcome then you get a lot of pissed off people who miss out. Pick equality of opportunity then you have to accept people will achieve different things and guess what pissed off people.

False dichotomy alarm. 

&gt;So what do you do? Try and balance the two no doubt. That is what we do. What is your version of ""equality""?

Who does that??? We don't in our society. What are you smoking? Our society worships those who grab a disproportionate slice of the pie. It is obscenely disproportionate. I don't give a shit if you have more stuff than me or a nicer car. The shit I can do with a drum kit is worth a million times more to me than anything I could ever own. And I ain't that good at it. 

My version of equality is everyone being able to make the best of themselves in terms of their talents and desires but not being able to acquire so much that it impact's on someone else's wellbeing. I assume that would require constant negotiation.

&gt;The basic needs of many are met the number in absolute poverty is significantly less than the population of the world - being generous only some 20% of the global population is in absolute poverty.

Who sets the measurements? 

&gt;Or perhaps you're more concerned about relative poverty? Yes, there is a lot to be said for this measure but I do think that is something for /r/firstworldproblems.

Relative poverty is not to be ignored. If you write off the poverty of someone in a sink estate versus a millionaire because others are worse off in another part of the world, you are denying your own intelligence. To brand relative poverty as ""First World Problems"" is politically ignorant. The global inequalities are important but local inequalities are as important. These are parallel problems.

What you can do to make people react more to your trolling attempts is to be slightly more consistent.. like for example: make a new muslim sounding nickname, and go around saying all sorts of pro-hardcore-islamic stupid crap. You will probably annoy people much more this way.

The thing that ruined your trolling attempts for me is that you used the nick 'EasternEuropean' and try to pretend to be pro-nazi or some crap like that.. it's just comical.. inconsistent troll is inconsistent.

Oh also.. the other thing you have to account for is that certain groups of people react to trolling attempts in a more entertaining way than others. Find a niche group and there are lots of luls to be had.

However if the government doesn't take on debt the investors still have their investment moneys but they have to look elsewhere to place them . If the government creates good conditions for new business investment this will attract the placement of investment moneys , will stimulate the economy but won't cost the taxpayers anything . Business people are far better capable of successfully applying investment moneys than government . Government is likely to be very ineffective - ie. unproductive - in it's application of any investment moneys.

That is a horrible outlook! I certainly hope that that isn't a widespread view, in particular among European leaders. Just giving up on them is like asking them to riot. Someone who just turned 40 still have 25 productive years ahead.

i tried copying the search results with filters but seems like its too long and i doubt it will work. so do this:
go to: http://www.wg-gesucht.de/
enter ""düsseldorf"" in the box under Angebote Lesen
you can choose under ""Rubrik wählen"" either WG-Zimmer (which is flat-share) or 1-Zimmer Wohnung. I suggest WG-Zimmer cos i don't know if you can meet up with the landlord with such short notice. But try both and write to all of them.

Here, you have to do some filtering: min. Einzugsdatum (minimum date to move in), put something like 15th May
and in max. Einzugsdatum put in 1st June (latest day you have to move in)
If you want to you can also choose under ""Mietart"" - Zwischenmiete, which means you will be there for only a short period of time.

You can live in the boroughs: Stadtmitte (city) Bilk, Oberbilk, Derendorf, Friedrichstadt which are all near city and easy to access. But you may not have the luxury to choose.

You can write in English, but maybe you can start like this (change the brackets to your info).

Hallo, ich heisse (your name) und ich werde ende Mai nach Düsseldorf einreisen um ein Praktikum für mein Jura Studium zu machen. Das Praktikum endet Anfang August und ich hoffe eine Wohnung zu finden wo man gut in die Stadtmitte kommt. Ich komme aus (where you come from) und spreche leider noch nicht sehr gut Deutsch, deswegen werde ich weiter in Englisch schreiben.

you can continue in English then. Since you might have flatmates, its nice to talk a little about your interest, hobbies, maybe a little about your hometown and your studies etc. Usually, younger people and students do WG and if you are lucky and one of them does American studies or is an anglophile, you might have a very good chance.

1) Yes! You can simply walk or bike along the banks of the river Rhine to travel between Düsseldorf and Cologne. I suggest you take a bike so that you can make the trip (and easily, too) in one day. If you want to return quickly, you can take your bike on the local train (S-Bahn) for cheap outside of rush hour. I've made this trip on bike several times.

Just stick to the river; with your experience, you don't even need to take a map. There are a couple places where you have to get around an industrial lot, that's all. Stick to the left (looking downstream) of the river on the southern half of the trip. (You can cross via the bridge at Leverkusen or the ferries in Langel/Hitdorf and Zons. Up north, I believe both sides are okay.

2) Even big German cities usually have a core downtown small enough to walk around. If you buy a ticket for local public transportation, it's valid for everything: bus, subway, tram.  
The S-Bahn and other regional trains as well as long-distance trains are fine, too. Check bahn.de (they're in English, too). It's the company for long distance trains, but they'll find bus and tram connections, too.

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-432075/Multiculturalism-drives-young-Muslims-shun-British-values.html
- 75% of young muslims want women to wear the veil (or at least hijab) compared to 19% of adult population.

– 40 percent support the introduction of sharia for British Muslims.
– 33 percent support a worldwide Islamic caliphate based on sharia.

However, for the rest, you might find that it can be quite cheap to travel around by train. For example I, starting from Bucharest, can buy a ticket all the way to Paris for roughly 150euros (230 two-way) and that's basically clear across the area covered by the pass. Then again the most expensive destination from Buc. would be Koln for 204 or 230 two way so there are differences across countries...

That being said, depending how much you travel you might find that it you will pay just as much for more intense travel over 2-3 weeks or for a pass for the same period...Or you might pay for the pass too much considering the limited benefits for that short a period. (something like the 2-3months would provide significant benefits otherwise its more a hit or miss)

My advice, take a look at these [regional passes](http://www.eurail.com/eurail-passes/regional-pass) might be more useful... and any additional tickets are cheap enough...

The problem is that it would take power away from national leaders, whose main roles in the EU are within the European Council and the Council of Ministers. The EU has a democratic deficiency because much of what the EU does is decided by these councils, who are responsible only to their national electorates, rather than the European electorate. If these powers are instead transferred to the Commission and Parliament, then they could easily be reformed into a more traditional parliamentary system.

This has been the single most fundamental debate over European integration. How far does supranationality progress at the expense of national sovereignty? Taking away power from the European Council and the Council of Ministers would represent a huge loss of sovereignty for every member state, which is something most Europeans do not want. Europeans need to understand that the desire for a more democratic EU can really only be done at the expense of their own nation-state's sovereignty. The moment this debate is resolved is the moment that the EU's endgame becomes clear: Either it becomes a federation or not. Most Eurocrats want federation, or something closer to it. The only practical way to get to federation is decades of gradual integration and building a common European identity. This issue will resolve itself in time, but it won't happen now. To put it simply, what do Europeans care about more: a democratic EU, or preserving major elements of national sovereignty?

That being said, there has been talk of merging the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission into one position.

I read today that if solar continues to grow at the exponential pace and efficiency gains it has over the last 20 years which is following a similar path to what computing has under Moore's law, it will take 18 more years for us to reach complete energy abundance through solar whilst only using 1% of what is technically available. With energy abundance, comes fresh water and food abundance (with help through automation). Add in solar powered electric Google cars (which could all be pooled together to give greater efficiencies) and you get travel abundance, planetary resources and robotic based advanced recycling for commodity abundance and the final disruption needed will be medical abundance. I think by 2050 money will still exist, but will not hold the power it does now and working will be optional or only something you need to do for a small amount of time until you have enough to make whatever choices you like with you're time.

   What is more important, maintaining the entertainment industry in its current shape or ensuring freedom of information? Either way, the world doesn't end.


 If we try to protect the entertainment industry, as well as other forms of intellectual property, doing any creative work is initially a legal minefield but afterwards can make enough profit to induce further work.  This favours the already big and successful, those industries which have large initial cost which they cannot avoid, and lawyers, whom thrive off of fear and uncertainty.
       

 On the other hand, ensuring freedom of information would destroy most current big movie studios, game developers, music producers,  and publishers of all kind.  Replacing them with viable business models will take time and will cause a lot of disruption to a lot of people lives, such as those working in television, film theatres, game stores, and book shops. But it would also remove barriers to creative work for both producers and consumers, and that seems important if you grew up on boot-legged/ scanned science fiction books and comics, which weren’t published in my post-commie country, and currently seeing stuff like [this](http://notch.tumblr.com/post/8519901309/bethesda-are-suing-us-heres-the-full-story) happening.

a) ""Greek statistics""

&gt; In 2004, four years after Greece's eurozone application had been endorsed on the basis of those statistics, the newly elected New Democracy government decided to change the method of recording defence equipment expenditure, so as to lighten the budgetary burden during its term of office. This change meant recording expenditure upon payment of the deposit, instead of recording it upon delivery, as had been done by the government until then. However, this change had the effect of increasing government deficits prior to 2004 and thus damaged Greece's reputation. [...] But the allegation indicates ignorance, not to say hypocrisy. Because even including defence expenditure upon order and not delivery, under the new recording method the revised state deficit figures in the critical year (1999) became 3.1% of GDP against 2.5% of GDP previously. The precise figure was actually 3.07%, according to Eurostat (AMECO). *This deficit is still lower than the equivalent revised deficits of other member states that were assessed on the basis of 1997 statistics, and which formed the first wave of member states that created the euro area in 1999.*

In other words, even France couldn't (supposedly) join the Eurozone. It should be noted that the ""statgate"" was a (non) issue raised by [EPP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party)'s leaders (New Democracy's partners in EU), trying to get back at [PES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_European_Socialists).

b) [Greek Porsche owners](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17702226)

&gt;Lukas Kunze (spokesman at Porsche) says the story is ""ridiculous"". In total, they had only sold around 1,500 Porsche Cayennes in Greece since the launch of the luxury car nine years ago.

c) [High incomes, low contributions](http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_25/04/2012_439333)

&gt; Real incomes in Greece dropped by a massive 25.3 percent in 2011 from the year before. [...] In total, the share of tax and social security contributions (by employers and employees) amounts to 38 percent of total salary costs. 

Less income, more taxes, cost of life remains as high as ever. There's the explanation about the increase in suicide rates.

On a lighter note (not), international community's statistics:

&gt; The recession, initially predicted by the IMF to be -7.5% between 2009 and 2012, is now estimated to have reached -18%, resulting in a failure to meet other targets and generating intense social unrest.

You don't solve any debt problem during a recession. You need to get the economy to restart at a reasonable pace. Most European countries have basically the same problem Greece has, only several orders of magnitude smaller. The cold truth is you can't solve the debt problem without growth and you can't have growth with austerity.

There's something that could be done with the help of European Central Bank : issue bonds with a low rate dedicated to reimburse the old debt stock and purge it. With such a mechanism, a country like Italy would get out of the red zone, since without the charge of interests, Italy wouldn't have any deficit. It would ease the situation of many countries without favoring spending spree from politicians.

&gt; Some corrections were proven to be necessary for Europe's model of the welfare state.

Did I miss part II?

&gt; I don't need to understand the mechanics of the system, a dead fish told me about it. 

I would argue you do, at least to some level because otherwise how to do you believe one ""expert"" over another? Look at the silly comments you get when talking about particle physics - some of the populace appear to believe the world will end if you collide too many atoms.

Something somewhere must inform your point of view, you are a part of whatever system you are in, whether it is anarcho-communist or libertarian - something must inform your view. Otherwise you really are harking back to very simple faith-based models.

&gt; if the doctor has interests beyond providing you healthcare, like paying off his sports car, he might be tempted to offer you something you don't need or something harmful. 

Indeed, but this is true for any person under any system. Someone can always have a motive which is non-obvious. Motivation does not evaporate because you change the system. 

&gt; But I don't really know about Monsanto and I don't have to to know they are dangerous. I don't have to know exactly how nuclear powerplants work to know the are dangerous.

How did you arrive at those conclusions?

&gt; What's missing from what you said is that the system can collapse from under you. 

*Any* system can and inevitably will collapse. Yes we need to evolve how the systems work to reflect how society changes but we should have reached a point where these changes can happen in a managed and order fashion. If you're talking abotu revolutions and whatnot then you've taken a few evolutionary steps back.

&gt; You seem to be brushing off abuse, bullying and coercion. Don't you want to do something good with yourself instead of defending the status quo?

Honestly, the status quo suits me reasonably well. I have sufficient resources to do most of what I want. Certainly I am living well above the global average.

However, this is not to say I dont want to change the system and improve it. Of course I do. But every single alternative system I have read about from the strains of anarchism to more extreme versions of libertarianism and communism are basically wanting to replace one set of bastards for another. 

Some of the power may shift, but only to another person or group which will replace the current set of political elites. 

Some of the talk of how anarchist communities would work sounds great and I would support transition to those models however, as far as concepts go they do no more to promote equality than any other system. The promote different types of equality.

&gt; Most prey animals are not too bothered most of the time, most apes have what they need in their areas.

Even a cursory glance at a BBC nature program would show that your comment is a bit fanciful. Nature is slightly more brutal than an ape sat around scratching his arse surrounded by plentiful food. You're projecting an idealised state.

&gt; I remember reading an anthropology book in which they point out that studies of chimps, for example fail often to take into account that habitats are under threat, their natural living areas are shrinking and conclusions about violence and hierarchies may be distorted by these factors.

Yes, this is a valid argument.

&gt; Humans are pretty stupid. The really stupid ones are those who think their education made them less stupid. 

Agreed. 

&gt; You want the iPad but you are afraid to think humans are collectively capable of dealing with the burden of existence in a fairer way.

You keep mentioning fairness and equality. Please define what you mean by these terms. They are quite subjective.

&gt; I know people in poor countries who can't get basic medical problems sorted due to lack of money and resources. 

Money is a representation of a resource, a means of deciding and arbitrating the value of resources relative to each other i.e. a means of exchange.

&gt; There are, as I said, plenty of ideas and even implementations which allow it. I suggested sources. Anarchism proposes something I like. But I am not dogmatic about it. It is possible the American Natives lived pretty well. Why not apply their system to the modern world and see what happens?

I know, I have read up on many of them as I am sure you have too. The reason for not adopting systems wholescale is primarily because people dont want to. People are inherently afraid of change - ""better the devil you know""

Also there is a cost to changing systems, a lot of people would not want to pay this cost and maybe the change itself is not practical. I know your comment was slightly flippant but ther eare not sufficient resources to get 60 million Britons migrating behind herds of wildebeest - not enough grass for a start!

&gt; You are propagandised, comrade. 

To some extent yes, but then we are all conditioned by one thing or another. We are relatively lucky in that we can mostly choose how we are propagandised. 

What has led you to your current set of beliefs? I mean in a life context not just ""I picked up a book and my mind was blown"" what led you to picknig up that book. What is the influence of your parents and friends etc?

&gt; Hippy nirvana? 

Yeah ok, a bit unnecessary but my point is that animals do not live in a world of plenty, they never have. Neither has humans. The concepts that you throw around ""basic needs"" and ""equality"" are reasoanbly subjective and change over time. 

Like as not we are competing with both other animals and each other for no particular purpose other than to spread our genetic material. It is inherently destructive since greed is a winning strategy. Altruism has evolved and offers some bonuses but a persistent altruist will be a dead one soon enough.

&gt; I don't have much freedom because I am a prisoner of the money system. My biggest challenge in life is paying the rent and bills.

In all seriousness what do you think your biggest challenge should be? One way or another resources need to be expended in order to feed you, clothe you and house you.

In various models were that is taken over by the state you then have a very powerful state, sure there are suggested ways to mitigate that but the problem remains. And then again there is the issue of the Freerider. Why expend resources on someone who is not contributing? 

&gt; Why would someone feel entitled to live of the backs of millions of abused people?

You believe wrong, what's happening in Greece and Spain right now shows that not only is austerity not working, it's making things worse: a sinking economy cannot pay its debt, even if gov't spending is way d

What went wrong over decades is that gov't started accumulating debt. Why did they? The main reason was not so much spending as the Austrian-inspired push to lower taxes. Sarkozy is especially guilty of that nonsense, since his very second move upon getting the presidency (the first was giving himself a raise) was to lower taxes on the very rich (""bouclier fiscal""). 

I understand that it's right wing policy, and when you elect a fascist you get reich wing policies, but what I'm faulting him for is that he lowered taxes _before_ he lowered spending. Well he actually never lowered spending. 

Sure, lowering spending is hard, but that's no excuse for fucking up the budget. 

And the sad joke is that this fascist piece of shit wanted to pass a ""golden rule"" law a few months ago, after having fucked shit up for nearly five years.

**Part I** 

(I have never been made to write so much)

&gt;I would argue you do, at least to some level because otherwise how to do you believe one ""expert"" over another? Look at the silly comments you get when talking about particle physics - some of the populace appear to believe the world will end if you collide too many atoms.

What I'm trying to say is that I don't have to understand in great depth the mechanics of a thing. I feel that I understand enough about the economic and political systems to opine. Otherwise you can't opine about anything at all because it is all so very complex and specialised. I understand that money is loaned into existence and that credit default swaps are a sort of insurance policy which can never be paid out. I understand that nuclear plants can break and release incredibly toxic material into the environment. Preventing this requires the accoutrements of industrial civilisation. 

I don't know about the consequences of colliding atoms but if the people telling me it's OK are proven to be untrstworthy I would rather tell them to stop and find something else to play with. 

&gt;Something somewhere must inform your point of view, you are a part of whatever system you are in, whether it is anarcho-communist or libertarian - something must inform your view. Otherwise you really are harking back to very simple faith-based models.

Something of course informs the point of view. It's just that that something is not expertise. You can't be an expert in more than one or two fields these days unless you're a very rare type of person. Even most experts are possibly not really experts because you and I can't tell if they're experts or not. If I tell you I am an expert about fish and you know nothing about fish, you can't tell. But if I tell you that fish stocks are depleted due to ocean acidification and over fishing, you can assess whether you think it's true or not depending on various bits of available knowledge whose credibility you can judge on your gut. After all, most of what we think and decide is from the gut and then we pretend we are rational.

&gt;Indeed, but this is true for any person under any system. Someone can always have a motive which is non-obvious. Motivation does not evaporate because you change the system.

Yes. But when the system is designed to actively encourage corruption and dishonesty one might think it would be a good idea to think about ways to have systems that discourage those things. There will always be muggers but our system tries to discourage this. If you had a system that encouraged mugging you might want to change it even knowing that you could never stop it altogether. 

&gt;How did you arrive at those conclusions?

Everything I read about Monsanto that I can understand shows me they are not trustworthy and they do not have the interests of their customers or humankind at heart. I don't have to understand anything about genetic engineering to dig this. Monsanto are monopolising seed stocks, they are using patent laws to restrict freedoms, they use their influence with governments to pursue their agenda etc. I know that I don't trust them to fuck around with the building blocks of life. I don't have to become an expert in bio-genetics or whatever it is to know that I want them to go away.

&gt;Honestly, the status quo suits me reasonably well. I have sufficient resources to do most of what I want. Certainly I am living well above the global average.
 
This is very important. This is selfish and short term thinking. I am living well above the global average. It is luck and not related to any virtue I may embody. I do something I like and something I don't like but that isn't too bad. But I am aware that it's built on the suffering of others and would be happy to take a cut if it meant greater fairness. I am conscious that your children could very easily be the suicidal Foxconn workers of the next generation. Your intelligence should lead you to take a broader view of things. I am sad you are basically saying ""I'm alright Jack.""

&gt;Even a cursory glance at a BBC nature program would show that your comment is a bit fanciful. Nature is slightly more brutal than an ape sat around scratching his arse surrounded by plentiful food. You're projecting an idealised state.

You know that a BBC nature programme, as delightful as it is, is produced for entertainment value. The lion grabs the wildebeest but there are thousands of wildebeest who aren't affected. For ten minutes it's all life-and-death action. The sea birds swoop and grab poor fishies from beneath the waves and it's a massacre for an hour but for the rest of the time the fishies go about their business without a care in the world. I don't think I'm projecting an idealised state. I think the world is a brutal hellhole. 

&gt;You keep mentioning fairness and equality. Please define what you mean by these terms. They are quite subjective.

I think I have the best chance if I use examples. Unfair is that if you happen to be born to parents wealthy enough to send you to a private school, you are introduced to a social network and are taught to obey certain rules and regulations (""education"" some would call it) that give you a huge advantage in life insofar as gaining status and access to material wealth. Of course the unfairness can be overcome but only by a few particularly determined people. Fairness would be having an education system that gave everyone an equal chance to do well in society. Attending one particular school or being part of a particular network or institution should not be an automatic blessing for some people. I realise that people will tend to help each other and support the members of their networks anyway, it's even a good thing on a community-wide basis but being institutionalised like this is unfair. 

Staying on the topic of school, inequality is having a system of education which favours people with an affinity for a particular type of knowledge and way of understanding the world. In the present system even a good institution favours what I would refer to as ""book-learning"". If you like maths and geography, facts and reason, you can find something fulfilling in education. But maybe only a third (just a wild guess for sake of argument) of us are naturally inclined towards this sort of learning. What about the artists, craftspeople, philosophers and out-and-out lunatics among us? We are forced to adhere to the book-learning model. This means the system treats people with different inclinations unequally. Equality would be finding ways for people to learn in line with their inclinations. Sure we all need to know reading and basic maths.

&gt;Money is a representation of a resource, a means of deciding and arbitrating the value of resources relative to each other i.e. a means of exchange.

It could be but it's not actually that. The value of money has no relationship with availability or value of resources. It is created when an individual or organisation borrows it. Prices are set by a complex system to do with what you can get away with charging for something and how easy it is to exploit the labour of people who produce stuff. Not to mention there is a massive system of money trading as if it's a thing of some sort which affects the relationship between currencies. 

&gt;I know, I have read up on many of them as I am sure you have too. The reason for not adopting systems wholescale is primarily because people dont want to. People are inherently afraid of change - ""better the devil you know""

Yes, I am aware that people are not conscious of the mechanisms that control our lives. They think we are free and that we make choices. But we are controlled by massive propaganda efforts and our desire to conform is exploited to the max. A change in consciousness is required - like you realising that the system is unfair and not wanting to be part of it. Maybe it takes generations for the idea to spread. By the by, I believe the system is going to crash disastrously some time soon and possibly in my lifetime (I might have another 30-40 years on the planet at most). Then people will have to change. 

&gt;Also there is a cost to changing systems, a lot of people would not want to pay this cost and maybe the change itself is not practical. I know your comment was slightly flippant but there are not sufficient resources to get 60 million Britons migrating behind herds of wildebeest - not enough grass for a start!

Also there is no way for 60 millions of Britons to be fed by the resources on these Islands the expertise isn't here anymore. Once East Angular is under water, this becomes even more difficult. We should be seriously thinking about this because flying your food in stops being viable in a few years. Do we need to think about cost under these circumstances, especially since we know that money, the measure of cost, is voodoo? 


&gt;To some extent yes, but then we are all conditioned by one thing or another. We are relatively lucky in that we can mostly choose how we are propagandised.

Hmmm. It's good you know we are propagandised but the majority don't know this. Also, you can know intellectually but not KNOW. 

&gt;What has led you to your current set of beliefs? I mean in a life context not just ""I picked up a book and my mind was blown"" what led you to picknig up that book. What is the influence of your parents and friends etc?

I am not real, or my sense of self and individuality is an illusion. I am an eddy in the vast current of biology and culture. My thoughts and views are largely a product of this flow mixed with my personal hang-ups. I assume the same is true of most. If I believed in some sort of spiritual system I might think that god or karma yield an influence too but I don't think I believe anything like this. 


&gt;Yeah ok, a bit unnecessary but my point is that animals do not live in a world of plenty, they never have. Neither has humans. The concepts that you throw around ""basic needs"" and ""equality"" are reasoanbly subjective and change over time.

I don't understand why you think this. Which animals suffer from a lack of resources? If nothing else, the levels of population are largely controlled by availability of resources. Only humans have escaped that relationship. Of course there are occasional die offs, there will always be upsets. 

&gt;Like as not we are competing with both other animals and each other for no particular purpose other than to spread our genetic material. It is inherently destructive since greed is a winning strategy. Altruism has evolved and offers some bonuses but a persistent altruist will be a dead one soon enough.

Humans have broken free of certain constraints that bind the other life forms. Greed is not a winning strategy as far as it works at the moment. Watch as the human population has to adjust suddenly from nine billion to one in a short time because we kept thinking this. Horror. 

The social Darwinism idea is really stupid. It's a product of an inability to interpret what evolution is. And I don't think that evolution is fully understood. It is a recent development that suggests that your individual life can change your genetic structure in a way you can ass traits on to your offspring. 

Altruism could work very well as a system and has worked for as long as modern agricultural civilisation has, if anthropologists can be believed. 


&gt;In all seriousness what do you think your biggest challenge should be? One way or another resources need to be expended in order to feed you, clothe you and house you.

I don't have any input into this. My biggest challenge should be whatever turns me on. The feeding, clothing and housing might be done by people who feel they want to work in those areas or who can be rewarded for doing those things. Some people might do those things themselves. We will always trade something for something else. I don't know if this is the case still but in Cuba, if you want a home you had the option of becoming a labourer on a building project and you would be given somewhere to live. The problem of accommodation and food does not need to be a ball and chain. Without the very basics taking up your entire life you can challenge yourself with a million differnt things which are far more useful or enjoyable. 

&gt;In various models were that is taken over by the state you then have a very powerful state, sure there are suggested ways to mitigate that but the problem remains. And then again there is the issue of the Freerider. Why expend resources on someone who is not contributing?

I don't think a state is required but communities would be. Also, I don't think that providing basic things makes the state any more powerful than it is. The state is a menace to our existence. If I was entitled to free food and shelter it would not make things worse. It would free me from the power of employers to blackmail me into doing stuff for them. 

I am not concerned about free riders. Let someone free ride. Who gives a shit? Who says what amounts to a contribution? Anyone who interacts with their fellow humans is making a contribution, they talk to their neighbours, give them some weed, help them move the sofa, they volunteer, they do a bit of babysitting or they have an allotment. People who are totally reclusive and don't want to engage in society at all are a minority and I am more than happy to ""pay"" for their existence. What's the problem? I am doing OK and don't mind giving something away, I don't need to feel anyone owes me something. Grow up. Healthy and balanced people want to do stuff. Trust a bit. 


&gt;It is sad that some do and it is something we should try to fix. But unless you are prepared to start fighting more wars things are not gonig to change at a speed that you would want.

I doubt your integrity. Whether you realise it or not, by being attached to the system we have, you are actively contributing to abuse because it is an essential component of the system. For you to have a car and a large house (by global standards) and hot water (or running water at all) others (90% of us) HAVE TO GO WITHOUT. It's the way the system works. 

We have little or no power to change this system in a tangible way. We have no access to the political and economic systems. I don't even think that individuals who are powerful in those systems have access to do anything novel if they could even recognise the need to do so. But you can change the way you look at things, your intent and consciousness. This can spread.

&gt;And the sad joke is that this fascist piece of shit wanted to pass a ""golden rule"" law a few months ago, after having fucked shit up for nearly five years.

France had a social safety net (long before Sarkozy) which activated and increased public deficit when the crisis arrived. That's why the budget is not in a good shape right now. By your comment I guess I cannot convince you of how people, in any country, tend to overvalue the role of presidents in the state of the economy.

Take for example, the boom in Latin American countries and Australia. Is it good political leadership? Think more about the demand in raw materials from emerging countries like China and India. Of course, if you compare Colombia and Venezuela you might be able to attribute divergences in economic performance to political leadership. But this local factor is much smaller than the global factor.

&gt; * an annual budget deficit no higher than 3% of GDP (this includes the sum of all public budgets, including municipalities, regions, etc.)

If you were to additionally increase public spending, investors would have been further doubtful of the government's capacity to pay its debt. Any *possible future* alleviation of the debt provided by *the possibility* of growth *in the future* would have been outweighed by the *certain* and *immediate* aggravation of the debt imposed by this public spending. The mess Greece and other European countries were in simply did not allow room for growth policy backed on public spending at the time.

true,Liface,null,null,"I came to Spain in late November in the last year from the United States in a similar position as you - about three years of experience in the tech field, decent level of Spanish, but probably just below the level required to use it in a professional environment. 

The first thing I did was pull my contacts and networks together - I searched on LinkedIn for any friends of friends that lived in Spain. Through one of these contacts, I had a job interview and subsequent offer the second day in the country. I ended up turning it down because it was pretty far outside Madrid and the salary was pitiful (16,000€ a year). As a side note, get used to seeing low, low, LOW salaries. If you can make 25K€ a year, consider yourself incredibly lucky. I've seen listings on Infojobs for that much for managers of 15+ people. 

So after I turned the job down, I just went to tecnoempleo and infojobs and applied for about three jobs a day. For the Spanish listings I sent in Spanish resumes and for the English listings I sent in English resumes. I ended up applying to 80 jobs in total over the course of 2.5 months. During this time, I was travelling around Spain, staying in different hostels, talking to people as much as I could and ended up improving my Spanish quite a bit. Of the 80 jobs, I got about 8 phone interviews, 5 of which led to an actual interview, 3 offers, and ended up taking an offer in Barcelona.

It certainly *is* possible to find technical positions that don't require Spanish. That's why a lot of job postings on infojobs are posted in English only. But knowing Spanish will be a huge leg up. For example, my company does not require any Spanish level at all. However, even though we are 200 people from 40+ different countries, the common language is Spanish, not English. When we go out to eat, we speak Spanish. When we go to the water cooler, we speak Spanish. Even if I'm doing official business for the company, I speak Spanish 95% of the time. I feel sorry for the few people at the office who don't speak Spanish because they are frequently left out of the office ""culture"" just because of the language barrier.

So, take-away points:

1. Get used to seeing ridiculously low salaries for ridiculously highly-qualified positions. 

2. While you apply for jobs, take some time, travel around Spain, immerse yourself, and improve your Spanish. 

3. Be persistent, be patient, and use your networks. Eventually, you will find something.

Dans ce cas précis, il s'agit d'une arme par destination, utilisée pour blesser psychologiquement la cible.

**Les violences psychologiques sont réprimées comme les violences physiques** (c'est essentiellement fait pour protéger les conjoints victimes et les membres de sectes), donc c'est bien une arme.

(En passant, je pense quand même que même avec une tarte, c'est un coup dans la figure, donc une violence physique.)

Regardons ensuite **les dégâts** : s'il n'y en a pas, c'est une contravention de 4ème classe ; s'ils sont inférieurs à 8 jours d'ITT (l'échelle utilisée en droit pénal pour mesurer les dégâts ; c'est un médecin légiste qui, après examen, détermine le nombre de jours d'ITT), c'est une contravention de 5ème classe.

Dans ce cas, il n'y a probablement pas ou très peu de dégâts, mais l'usage de l'arme est une circonstance aggravante qui fait passer l'infraction dans la catégorie supérieure, celle des délits.

Pour moi, il y a même deux autres circonstances aggravantes (la liste est dans l'article 222-13 du code pénal) :

* sur personne dépositaire de l'autorité publique
* avec préméditation et guet-apens

Je ne sais pas si ces circonstances ont été retenues par le procureur ou le seront par le tribunal. 

Les peines maximales prévues sont donc :

* sans circonstance aggravante : contravention de 4ème ou 5ème classe
* une circ. agg. : 3 ans de prison et 45.000 € d'amende
* deux circ. agg. : 5 ans, 75.000 €
* trois (ou plus) circ. agg. : 7 ans, 100.000 €

Je rappelle en conclusion que :

* **la justice en France n'est pas un algorithme** (de plus en plus au fil des années, mais encore très en deçà de ce qui a cours aux USA par exemple) : les juges prennent en compte les circonstances et la personnalité de l'intéressé, et **il n'y a pas de peine minimale** pour une infraction donnée

* le procureur (ou ses services) décide quelle est l'infraction à poursuivre (on dit *qualifier*), mais il ne s'agit que d'une indication pour les juges, lesquels sont les seuls à pouvoir qualifier définitivement.

To do this we both need a pan-European banking authority and regulator, but more than that we need pan-European deposit insurance institution with authority to tab additional funds from the ECB if needed. There are multitude of reason why we haven't already created this, few of the big ones are... A) member states reluctance of submitting authority to European level; and B) question about what to do with bank profits, if risks involved with banks are Europeanized, then shouldn't also taxes be paid to the EU and not to members.

I myself believe that in this decade we will see these issues solved as we have already seen the creation of Eurozone wide banking market with the introduction of SEPA system just recently. With SEPA system in place all Eurozone banks are domestic banks, it costs and takes the same time to transfer money from an account to account even if the banks are located in different countries.

Actually IMF already called for the creation of the pan-European insurance scheme.

true,glacinda,null,null,"Thanks! Honestly, I'm not surprised. Saarbrücken seems like no-man's land, even though there are a *ton* of students here. So, for the sake of staving off boredom, here goes!

1. My experience here is a bit different. I'm an au pair for a German family who is unlike any other German family I've ever met (big into hunting, unable to take care of themselves without outside help, never ever use public transportation, etc). As I've been to Germany twice before for 2 month+ stays, this really surprised me. So, while I like the city enough itself, I do not enjoy my living situation. Case in point: the mother didn't tell me I had the night off until 14:00, which means most of my friends here, who are students, already have plans or are unreachable. However, it's a nice enough city, close to France and Luxembourg. It would not be my top choice for staying permanently, but it was a nice change from Berlin and Baeyern. 

2. I guess I answered that, but I am not a student. I already have my Masters. I took an au pair job to hopefully make it easier to find teaching jobs over here. Pro Tip: It wasn't, hence moving back to the States in July. Get more experience, then try my hand again! However, because there is a great IT/CompSci PhD institute here, there are a lot of students. Strange that they don't use reddit (not a single person I've met here, some even being Americans also, knows about the site!). 

3. I have no idea about any music scene. There are lots of those random band stickers you see covering every public surface in Germany, but I've not experienced anything local. There are quite a few bars and a couple clubs. I've never been disappointed when I've gone out though, I will admit. Lots of smaller places to discover. Mainzerstrasse, Saarcenter, Johanneskirche - all good areas to explore!

4. A day off, huh? Well, walking by the river is nice, seeing the remains of the Schlossgarten and checking out the history museum. There's even an art musem. I mainly head to Saarcenter, which is a nice outdoor mall-type area.

I'll just add :  

* **Wednesday** : The Louvres is huge and full of beautiful art to see, decide in advance with your group what interests you because it's impossible to see it all. (personal favorite : Italien and French painting/Greek and Roman statues)  
There is an entrance that most people don't know about la [porte des Lions](http://imgur.com/YtHST) because the main entrance will have a queue no matter what. But I'm not sure about the closing hours.  

* **Thursday** : Honestly Champs Élysées is not a *need to see* It's not that pretty, full of tourists, every shop or café/brasserie on it is ridiculously more expensive then anywhere else... so walk down to Place de la Concorde visit the huge Louis Vuitton store if you want, but don't stop for lunch or even a quick cup of coffee.  

**DON'T** have lunch or even tea at Angelina. Same as the Champs Élysées it is terribly overrated, to expensive and you will have to wait in line to get in (which I find preposterous knowing how many nice cafés and little bistros there are in Paris waiting to be discovered)  

Notre Dame/Sainte Chapelle and Panthéon all in one afternoon ?  
I think you'll have to pick only one, two if you rush it and have no queue. IMO you don't need to visit the interior of Notre Dame, the facade is what is most interesting. Pantheon is nice and free.  


* **Friday** : what is Rue Cler ? Is there some restaurant you heard about in that street ?


* **Saturday** : No need to go to Moulin Rouge, just walk around in Montmartre, get lost and enjoy the little streets, unknown places, it can be quite amazing.  


I'm guessing by Musée de l'Orangerie you're not referring to the one in Tuilerie but to the [Musée du Luxembourg](http://www.museeduluxembourg.fr/en/infos-pratiques/acces/) that is next to orangerie in the Jardin du Luxembourg ?  


* **Sunday**  Giverny is an excellent choice !! The Marais is nice for a lazy sunday afternoon/evening.  



Carrousel du Louvres is just a shopping mal with an Apple store and starbucks... 




* Paris isn't the best city to go clubbing but there are some nice ones depending on your taste of music and the people you like to hang out with. I recommend : [Le Silencio](http://silencio-club.com/en/) designed by David Lynch kinda posh or in a more hipster/hype the [Rex Club](http://www.rexclub.com/) if you feel like dancing all night under the influence...  

""Lounge"" bars I enjoy are [Curio Parlor](http://www.curioparlor.com/) or [Prescription](http://www.prescriptioncocktailclub.com/) they're a bit expensive I guess but make some of the best cocktails in Paris and are very nice to chill. Also [La Candelaria](http://www.candelariaparis.com/) I like a lot.

Otherwise ask around for the nice bars that close late, avoid the tourist neighborhoods and the bouncers at the clubs can sometimes be a pain (but if you're all girls I think you'll be fine).

I'll also just recommend [Le Verre à Pied](http://leverreapied.fr/html/index.php?home) an old parisian bistro, food is good, waiters nice and not expensive. It's not too far from Pantheon.

If you have any questions feel free to pm me, otherwise I hope this helps and you'll all have a great time in Paris.

Yes, there are plenty of people that should not be allowed to own guns, like those with a record of violence or mental instability, but that does not negate the right that law-abiding citizens have to own firearms for legitimate purposes like recreational use and/or self-defense.

For every person that dies because some moron decided to draw his gun over something stupid there are probably more that live because they could defend themselves, and plenty of crimes prevented just by the deterring potential provided by a gun.

Shooting, obviously. It's a legitimate, fun sport, and as it is we don't even allow our bloody OLYMPIC SHOOTERS to train in the country. It's ridiculous

Our current gun laws are too restrictive, based on knee-jerk reactions when one nut shot some people in the 80s / 90s. Criminals (by definition don't obey the law anyway), so it's a rather meaningless ban meant purely to hinder honest citizens and give the sense of false safety to stupid middle-class housewifes.

&gt;But other than these well-circumscribed exceptions, people living in a civilised democracy don't need killing machines.

You can kill people with ANYTHING. Should be ban hammers and screwdrivers? People could still strangle others! We better ban hands!
