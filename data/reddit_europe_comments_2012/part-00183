true,rkoloeg,null,null,"As someone who speaks English, German and a bit of Swabian and Plattdeutsch, it's interesting to see how some Dutch words are more similar to archaic or ""folksy"" constructions in older Germanic.  For instance, in your passages:

similar/soortgelijke/ahnliche - the Dutch is closer to something like ""sort-alike"" in English, ""art-gleich"" in German, i.e. similar in type, which has been replaced by a Latin construction in English, and I don't know where the etymology for ahnliche comes from.

closer/dichterbij/naher - in German you could say ""dicht bei"" which literally means something like ""thickly upon it"", which also works in English - -think of the term ""cleaves to it"" which means to be closely bound up with another thing.  ""Nah"" in the German is closer to ""near"" in English but has come to mean ""close"" as well.

One more: ""Volgens mij"" could be rendered in German as ""volgend mir"" which is grammatically incorrect but roughly means ""following me"", which could be ""according to me"" in English and would also get the idea of ""in my opinion"" across sufficiently.

Nen ungewaschenen Sack oder Mumu zu haben ist auffällig. Es riecht. Er hat auch nie gesagt, dass keiner das Recht hat mit ungewaschenen Leuten Sex zu haben.

Schwarzer macht hier mal wieder eine Standardaussage von: ""Da wir ja so emanzipiert sind, werden Männer verpflichtet alles in die Hand zu nehmen"". Das Beispiel für ""Feminismus"" auf Bildniveau, der aus Emanzipation nur Vorteile will, aber nicht die Verpflichtungen der Männer teilen möchte. Und da wundert man sich noch wenn der ernsthafte Feminismus dann verlacht wird, weil er sich nicht auf das Schwarzer Level herunterlässt und gequirlte Scheiße von sich gibt. Das klingt wieder alles nach ""keine Widerrede weil ich ja sowieso gewinn', weil ich'n Mädchen bin"".

Jeder sollte auf Hygiene  achten, vorallem bei der schönsten Hauptsache der Welt, aber bei Schwarzer wird ebend nur noch Sexismus mit Sexismus bekämpft. Der Mann hat Schuld, die Frau ist das Opfer der bösen bösen Patriarchie und soll sich doch gefälligst nicht mehr rasieren, da dass ja ein Sinnbild der Unterdrückung durch den Phallus ist. 


Und jetzt rege ich mich schon wieder über diese Frau auf, womit sich für mich wieder beweist, dass sie durch ihre zweifelhafte Medienexistenz immer noch genug Einfluss auf uns hat. Dazu kommt noch, dass dieser weibliche Chauvinismus absolut konterproduktiv zu den ernsthaften Frauenbewegungen ist.

true,guysguy,null,null,"I disagree, at least partly. :) Germany’s success is not built around “tricking” or “forcing” others to buy our products, it’s a combination of countless things but I’ll get into a few here.

There was a recent article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung called [“13 reasons for Germany’s strength”](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/erfolgsgeheimnisse-deutschlands-staerke-hat-13-gruende-11925735.html), which mentioned a couple of things that are really important. Some of the reasons in the article are very subjective, others are facts. 

There’s no doubt that Germany has benefited greatly from the Euro, but I’m not sure why some people (not talking about you) point that out completely ignoring that Germany was well off *before* the Euro as well. We can look at the introduction of the Euro for certain things but we cannot make the Euro the main reason for Germany’s development. 

Another thing not mentioned in the FAZ article is that German companies are relatively autonomous. They don’t rely on banks a lot, they don’t want to borrow any money from banks and can operate without taking a loan. The German word for debt would translate to “guilt” and I think it’s definitely a cultural thing that companies in Germany want to be able to do whatever they want instead of having a bank telling them what they should do. In regards to this, I recommend this short BBC article: [German economic strength: The secrets of success](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18868704)

Another interesting article is this one from the L.A. Times: [Germany's economic strengths make it like the U.S. of yesteryear](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/22/business/la-fi-germany-middle-class-20120122)

As the comments there point out, this man flees into heval metal music far beyond what is normal. It is of course exceptional, but the government benefits allow him to have a normal job. 

[Yawasfb's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/155183/til_a_man_in_sweden_receives_disability_benefits/c7jidmy) clarifies:

&gt; Furthermore, it is not so much that he receives disability due to liking Heavy Metal. It interferes with his day to day life. He has some serious issues that I would not wish on anyone. He is, however, happy it seems so that is always something.

&gt; This is a man that will never be able to have a ""normal"" life. He have already managed to sabotage relationships due to this and several jobs. Anyone that has met him however say the same thing: He is obsessed with heavy metal but he is a real nice dude.


&gt; I would like to make a parallel here to hoarders almost. It is two completely different things but the idea is the same. They might look ok on the outside and in passing but enter their ""domain"" and you will see that their lives are dominated by something else.


&gt; I would take a guess that he has got professional help by now and probably working some minimum wage job (which is basically the disability benefit. He works for ""free"" somewhere and the government pay him minimum wage) saving up for the next concert or festival to go to.

Yeah, you know nothing of the situation...

In Belgium the racists vote for vlaams belang

&gt;Vlaams Belang (English: Flemish Interest, VB) is a Belgian far-right[3] political party in the Flemish Region and Brussels that advocates the independence of Flanders and strict limits on immigration, whereby immigrants would be obliged to adopt Flemish culture[4] and language. The party rejects multiculturalism, but accepts a multiethnic society as long as people of non-Flemish backgrounds assimilate into Flemish culture. The party is also eurosceptic.

The party in the article is NVA

&gt;The main objective of the party is to work on great institutional reforms by gradually obtaining more powers for both Belgian communities separately. Furthermore, it emphasizes its non-revolutionary and pro-European character (as opposed to the far-right character of the Vlaams Belang) in order to legitimize increased Flemish autonomy.[10]

also

&gt;A label for the political orientation of the N-VA is difficult to find as the party combines both left and right-wing policies. According to its 2009 election programme for Flanders, the N-VA is economically liberal and ecologically green. It supports public transport, open source software, renewable energy and taxing cars by the actual number of kilometers driven. It wants more aid for developing countries but also more compulsory measures to require that immigrants learn Dutch.[citation needed]

They are also cooperating with other parties

&gt;They currently participate in the Flemish Government, in coalition with the Christian democratic CD&amp;V and socialist sp.a.

It looks like Moria before dwarfs escaped :) They made whole underground chapels there from salt, etc.

If you like WW2 history, I recommend Uprising Museum in Warsaw. It's a great museum, very interactive. You can also see Old Town in Warsaw, remains of Warsaw Ghetto (there was another Uprising there - different from the Warsaw Uprising). Warsaw was almost completely ruined after WW2, then rebuilt, it's worth to see the Old Town for that alone - there are photos of how it looked after WW2.

Also worth seeing - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf%27s_Lair - it's big complex of bunkers and underground installations made by Germans during WW2 to coordinate Eastern Front fightings. It's in Mazuria region of Poland, also worth seeing because of tousands of lakes there. The plot to kill Hitler happened in the Wolf's Lair, too.

Other than that in Poland I recommend Gdańsk (also known as Danzig of WW2 and Solidarity fame), Malbork (kick ass Teutonic Order castle here - one of the biggest in Europe), Toruń (great medieval city, Planetarium there is nice, Copernicus was born there), Lublin (the best preserved death and concentration camp - Majdanek is nearby, there are still the original barracks there), also Old Town in Lublin is pretty (great renneisance and baroque sights, very different from germanic architecture in western Poland, Polish-Lithuanian Union was signed there, in Lublin Castle there is painting by famous Matejko of that event).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_Due

&gt; P2 was sometimes referred to as a ""state within a state"" or a ""shadow government"". The lodge had among its members prominent journalists, members of parliament, industrialists, and military leaders—including Silvio Berlusconi, who later became Prime Minister of Italy; the Savoy pretender to the Italian throne Victor Emmanuel; and the heads of all three Italian intelligence services (at the time SISDE, SISMI and CESIS). When searching Licio Gelli's villa, the police found a document called the ""Plan for Democratic Rebirth"", which called for a consolidation of the media, suppression of trade unions, and the rewriting of the Italian Constitution.

&gt; [...]

&gt; The Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry, headed by Anselmi, concluded that the P2 lodge was a secret criminal organization.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licio_Gelli#2003_interview

&gt; In 2003, Gelli told La Repubblica that it seemed that the P2 ""democratic rebirth plan"" was being implemented by Silvio Berlusconi:

&gt; &gt; *Every morning I speak to my conscience and the dialogue calms me down. I look at the country, read the newspaper, and think: ""All is becoming a reality little by little, piece by piece. To be truthful, I should have had the copyright to it. Justice, TV, public order. I wrote about this thirty years ago... Berlusconi is an extraordinary man, a man of action. This is what Italy needs: not a man of words, but a man of action.*

&gt; He talked of many Italian politicians. Of Fabrizio Cicchitto he said he knew him well (è bravo, preparato - ""he's good and capable""). With regard to Berlusconi's program for the reform of the judicial system, he boasted that this had been an integral part of his original project. He also approved of Berlusconi's reorganization of TV networks.

And it's not as if many heterosexual couples wouldn't enjoy anal sex, either.

Most justified argument for the old ways is the semantic one - marriage used to be only for man and woman and it is not nice when things change. But that was when the world was different - different types of families work as well and definitions change to fit the reality.

true,blubloblu,IREL,Ireland,"Abortion has been illegal in Ireland since at least 1861, that's the date of the law currently still in force.

After Roe -v- Wade in the US, pro-life people in Ireland were worried that the 1861 law could be changed, so they campaigned for a referendum to get the ban on abortion into the constitution: harder to change. In 1983, 67% voted in favour of our eighth amendment which enshrined an **equal right to life of the unborn and the mother.**

(there have been a few issues related to allowing information and travel to the UK for abortion)

In 1992, the attorney general attempted to stop a fourteen year old rape victim travelling to the UK for an abortion. The resulting Supreme Court judgement, the ""X Case"", interpreted the eighth amendment as allowing abortion in cases where there was a ""a real and substantial risk"" to the life of the mother, including suicide.

Following that ruling, an amendment was put to the people to specifically remove suicide as grounds for abortion, this was rejected in 1992, 65%. A similar referendum in 2002 was also rejected, 50.42%.

Despite the 1992 ruling, and the votes of the people, there has been no legislation passed (in twenty years!) to allow abortion in those circumstances. The current Government might pass something in the new year. If it does, it will likely be very narrow.

It will still be a long way before abortion will be allowed in cases of rape, fatal fetal abnormalities or risk to the health (as opposed to the life) of the mother.

Most of our exportations are of luxury goods, with a big added value, and since the market for those things is booming in China and Asia generally, the fact that sales in the Us and Europe were down didn't bother us. Sure, tourism was down, but since Gstaad is more of a luxury destination than, say, Ibiza, it wasn't all that bad. We also have very lax work regulations, and this brings much more investors than in France, with all their bureaucracy. Just one example of this : next to the Bâle-Mulhouse airport, at the border between France and Switzerland, there are two industrial zones, one operating under the French system and one under the Swiss system. The french zone is empty, the swiss zone is booming. What's more, this is not done at the expense of the employees, as workers are paid 50% more in Switzerland than in France - which itself is hardly a third world country.

But last year the crisis hit us, because the Swiss frank is a ""safe"" currency, and people tend to invest massively in it in hard times. So a year ago the exchange rate with the euro was 1:1. Our economy is really turned towards exportation, so having such a horrible exchange rate hit us hard, though it meant that the federal country could borrow at levels unheard of (we even had a couple times where we borrowed with a negative interest rate). So the BNS (our Fed) set the exchange rate at 1 EUR = 1.20 CHF, and is spending millions to maintain this. That's really the only bad point, but really we don't complain of it when you look at other countries - especially since there's a steady immigration to Switzerland from Portugal and Spain and the immigrants bring with them tales that make you shudder.",0,1356205899,null,0,false,0,c7kouq7,t3_15a4j2,t1_c7kouq7,t1_c7knj9a,null,1430745835,17,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,17

We take our daughters out to the shooting range, they are very comfortable with the guns and are good marksmen.  But all the arguments put forth about personal protection...I can't think of a time when I would have had time to get my guns out of their safe storage and get them prepped in time to respond to a situation, and if I could have, the situation could have been dealt with another way.  *Except* perhaps when I was a young woman living alone way out in the country and occasionally people would come lurking around.  In that instance it helped me sleep at night knowing I had my gun in my bedside table just in case, just to give me a chance, because certainly nobody would hear me scream out there.

I hear the thoughts about how we have the right to bear arms specifically should we ever need to stand up against our government, but that seems ridiculous, too.  All over the world people are managing to do what needs doing without that express right in a written constitution.  Besides, there's no way we could ever out-gun what our government has.  If the idea was for us to match them in force, we'd need to all have bombs and nuclear weapons, too.  

I go around and around with it, and I look at how the rest of the world is doing things, and I just can't justify all these guns we have.  I don't want to give mine up, and I use them responsibly, but still.

Never.  It's hard for a parent to do that to their son or daughter, no matter how out of control they are, no matter how fearful they might be.

We've been having public ""debates"" about immigration for decades, at the very least since the 90's which is the last time these fucknuts reared their ugly heads. Back then, they were Neo-Nazi skinheads -- today, they're suit-and-tie politicians. Their goals, their rhetoric and the target demographic is, however, exactly the same; moving the goalposts until their views are construed as a ""growing concern with immigration,"" rather than the pitiful squeaks of a few overprivileged shitheads.

Look.

You're not a racist for having concerns about the growing underclass. It's perfectly fine to feel threatened by someone who might take ""your"" job, or ""your"" child's spot in daycare. You've been meticulously trained to feel entitled to social services over people who don't ""deserve"" it as much as you do.

You're not a racist for wanting to sing your national anthem (yes, in church) on graduation day. No matter what the ""nationalist"" victim card is trying to portray, this is not racism. It's uninformed, laughably simplistic and looks terribly self-centered, but it doesn't make you a racist.

You're a racist if you talk like a racist. You're a racist if you use ""culture"" as a codeword for ""race,"" or if you take to Facebook every time someone makes a statement that your Pavlovian conditioning deems to be Politically Correct (a dead giveaway by itself). You're definitely a racist if you feel like being in ""your"" country is a privilege, and that the slightest misstep should warrant ""sending them home.""

SO hoity-toity. When the usage is found in Chaucer, Auden, Shakespeare, Byron, Thackeray, Dickens, Eliot and Jane Austen I really wouldn't be so bloody pompous if I were you.

&gt;*Is ""They"" the Future of Generic Pronouns?*

&gt;*I will state for the record that I am a firm believer that someday ""they"" will be the acceptable choice for this situation. English currently lacks a word that fits the bill, and many people are already either mistakenly or purposely using ""they"" as a singular generic personal pronoun; so it seems logical that rules will eventually move in that direction.*

http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/he-they-generic-personal-pronoun.aspx

&gt;*I am flummoxed by the controversy over it and by the resistance of many people to accept it. Singular they has long been used in literature and in conversation, and though it still has an informal taint, it seems to me absurd to resist adopting it when it satisfies an aching need.*

http://www.dailywritingtips.com/is-%E2%80%9Cthey%E2%80%9D-acceptable-as-a-singular-pronoun/



&gt;*The New Fowler’s Modern English Usage, has written that it’s only a matter of time before this practice becomes standard English: “The process now seems irreversible.” Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed.) already finds the singular they acceptable “even in literary and formal contexts,”*

To allow is not to promote. And I'm pretty sure they're against homosexuality not because of any rational reason but rather because the scripture defines it as sodomy and an abomination in the eyes of God.

My opinion on independence is that it's a fantastic idea. Unfortunately, polls show overall Scottish support for independence anywhere between 25 and 40 percent of the population, which wouldn't be a great referendum result. Ultimately, though, today's polls don't mean much: so many people are finding a place by emotional response, or because they don't understand the bonuses of independence. The SNP's White Paper, explaining the ins and outs of an independent Scotland, won't be released until next year, and neither the pro-indy or pro-Union campaigns have shifted into full gear yet - so there's lots of uncertainty and misinformation.

The sort of independence we're talking about is Scotland becoming a completely independent country from the United Kingdom, which today consists of Scotland, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The SNP, who have a majority in the devolved Scottish Government, want to keep Scotland in the European Union and in a free travel arrangement with the United Kingdom. They also want to retain the UK's currency until the Euro is stable enough to join. (The Republic of Ireland started their own currency, ""the Irish pound"", and pegged it at a 1:1 exchange rate with the British pound for many decades.)

Major pros are empowering the Scottish electorate. Scotland's government is much more left-wing than the UK government, to put it simply and bluntly; there are lots of disagreements over welfare and defence, both of which are matters reserved to the UK government. While the Scottish people can elect members of the UK parliament, this is obviously a small portion of the UK parliament, because Scotland's population is 5 million compared to the UK's 63 million or so. (Scotland is the second most populated part of the UK after England. Wales has something like 3 million, and Northern Ireland might be around 1 million.)

Details on the pros: Scotland would be able to start an oil fund, such as that which Norway has, by saving and investing the money earned from North Sea oil. This money is currently splashed about by the UK government on projects like the Trident nuclear weapons programme, which is based on the river Clyde in Scotland. It's been made clear time and time again through demonstrations and polls that the people of Scotland don't want nuclear weapons on their soil, but the UK government has refused to move them. Scottish independence is literally the sole option available to the Scottish people to remove these nuclear weapons from Scotland.

The major cons are losing what some are calling an ""economic safety net"". In the past, Scotland has been reliant on the rest of the UK, generally because of financial mismanagement by the UK government. Especially in the Thatcher years, Scotland's economy was devastated by poor decisions in London (there was no devolved parliament). Other cons are that we would be severing an ""ancient tie"" between the kingdoms of England and Scotland, and therefore losing some cultural heritage, which is an idea with which I strongly disagree. I think Scotland and England can share British culture without being one state, just as Norway and Sweden share Scandinavian culture. I feel some shared culture with the Irish, despite not being part of their country. In any case, I'm clearly biased, so best ask someone else about cons.

As for the relationship with England and the rest of the UK, it would remain relatively undamaged if the Scottish Government got their way, and it was handled amicably. So far, it has been relatively amicable and civilised, despite some childishness from certain members of both campaigns. Essentially, though, a good relationship with the UK would be important to a number of SNP desires, such as licensing BBC programmes for Scottish broadcast on Scotland's own new national broadcaster. There's also speculation that Scotland would do better to buddy up to the Bank of England if it wants to use the pound, because then the BoE could set economic policy that also benefits Scotland. However, it's pointed out that this is not actually necessary for Scotland to use the pound; it can simply follow the Irish and peg a ""Scottish pound"" to the British pound, or indeed accept British pounds without negotiating it with the British government.

Also amnesties for illegally exported capitals and so on. A very profitable scheme when you can inform 'friends' of upcoming amnesties so that they can take full advantage.

 2. Naive, easily brainwashed people. They get bombarded with a barrage of stupid news on the TV and tabloids that gradually paint a distorted picture of things.

true,CptHaddock,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; What's your opinion on independence (I'm assuming you're a Scot)?

(I'm not mojojo42 but I'm answering you) I lean towards the Union but I think I could be convinced for independence with a good argument. No one seems to be trying very hard to convince me though, which is what puzzles me. Nationalistic rhetoric has no sway on me and that's mostly what I see from the nationalists so far.
 
&gt; What is the opinion of the general public in Scotland?

For years now polls have shown about one third would vote for independence, which makes me think they need to start a really strong campaign to get a yes, which, again, I see little sign of.

&gt; What sort of independence are we talking about here?

Leaving the UK and becoming a completely separate state. England, Wales and Northern Ireland would still be in the UK.

&gt; What are some major pros and cons?

I don't know! Becoming a tiny state in Europe, do we stay in the EU? Have to re-apply? We wouldn't have much bargaining power, would we have to take the Euro? But we could truly set our own agenda, very few conservatives get voted in in Scotland but they currently run the UK parliament. Would we get downgraded from the UK's triple A credit status? There's a million unknowns.

&gt; How would this affect Scotland's place in the U.K./ their relationship with England as well as their place in the E.U. ?

Out of the UK altogether, obviously retain very close ties with everyone we would hope. There is ongoing discussion with the EU about whether we would automatically remain in or have to re-apply. The EU doesn't want to make it too easy a ride to be honest because that would set a precedent and independence movements in other areas, notably Catalonia, could gain momentum.",0,1356216541,null,0,1356216902,0,c7kr9b0,t3_15a4j2,t1_c7kr9b0,t1_c7kqdtl,null,1430746988,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Ideally, this would be the same for Scotland and England. There's little incentive for either the Scottish or UK Government to set up a bureaucratic armed border - the only reason they might set up a border check is if Scotland is forced to subscribe to the EU's Schengen Agreement, of which the UK is not currently a member. Some UK government ministers have suggested this would be the case because then the UK government would be afraid of Scotland being used as a proxy to get illegal immigrants or other undesirables into England and Wales.

(**edit:** Forgot to talk about trade. There should still be free trade, as both the United Kingdom and Scotland would be members of the European Union, of which free international trade is a core tenet. Unfortunately, there's a lot of Euroscepticism in the south - not lots, but more than in Scotland according to most studies - so it's possible the UK doesn't remain within the EU that much longer. If that's the case, I assume independent negotiations for free trade might be established. Scotland exports quite a lot to England and Wales; not just luxury items like scotch, either... we also provide them with quite a lot of electricity, and those contracts should last post-independence, given that it takes time to create new power plants.)

One big difference between Irish independence and Scottish independence, other than the nonviolence and democracy of the Scottish independence movement, is that the SNP don't want to found a republic. Alex Salmond is a fan of the monarchy, apparently, and wants to retain the current Queen as Queen of Scotland, and the rest of her line. This actually makes a sort of sense, because the Queen of the United Kingdom is directly descended from a past Scottish monarch, who became ruler of both the independent kingdoms of Scotland and England well in advance of their political union. Because of this, Scotland would seek to remain within the [Commonwealth of Nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations), which also includes Canada, Australia, and India.

Basically Grillo was a comedian that started tackling 'hot topics' a few years ago, pushing hard for stuff like electric cars -which might make sense- but also stuff that was pure snake oil. His shows became increasingly political, until he decided to ride the wave of political disenfranchisement that followed the Berlusconi years and Monti's emergency government.

He started a 'movement' of people who wanted to demolish the current political caste and start over with common people in the places of power, with a more direct form of democracy: online polls and internet discussions to decide policies. This captured the interest of MANY people who were fed up and were not voting any longer, an suddenly they jumped ahead in the polls. They even managed to elect a mayor or two and several city council members, picked from absolutely unknown, but 'common' people.

He's not even a candidate, but he directs the 'movement' with a dictatorial rule, banning and choosing people on rules that he makes up now and then. For example he suddenly decided that no one of the movement was allowed to go on TV if invited, and he kicked out those who did anyway. Some of his members started to complain about the lack of internal democracy, and he kicked them out too.

In the end they seem to be a bunch of 'political terrorists': they want to send people in the parliament to 'blow it up', but without having a clear goal beyond that.

In general, however, I think the EU is trying to act appropriately to the harmfulness of the substance at hand.

There's constant battle in the media, which goes roughly like that:

 - Kaczyński (from PIS) says PO badly managed the situation, and Russia is suspicious, and Poland should get the wreckage immadietely after the crash, and the investigation should be made by Poles from the start, and not Russians.

 - PO says everything was OK, and Kaczyński shouldn't use catastrophe for political means, and we will get the wreckage soon (which doesn't seem likely from what I understand)

Population would be about 25 million, with a total GDP of 1,6 billion USD (11th largest economy in the world, after Canada)

The federal government would be charge of federal taxes, foreign policy, commerce and the military. It would develop a naval force with an extreme focus on the arctic, with the ability to completely control the territory of Greenland and surrounding strategic area. A federal monopoly on mining and oil would extract the resources of Greenland and surrounding areas (instead of the current retarded initiative of giving it to the Chinese) and use the profits to fund the welfare states of the federation.

The kingdoms and former indepedent states would no longer have any powers, as the new regional governments would control areas a bit smaller than the current countries, I.e. Denmark would have a regional government of Jutland and one for the Islands, and Sweden would have a regional government for Skåne and other similar sized regions. These regions would all have a great degree of autonomy in many areas such as welfare, education, hospitals, etc. , and regions would have a weighted amount of mandates towards electing the federal government.

The Nordic Federation would be able to leave the EU, or at least get a much looser ""deal"", since the laws of the Nordic countries ( all with an extremely high ""ease of doing business"" rank) aren't really that compatible with the more bureaucratic and corrupt mainland Europe.

Border controls and immigration would be tightened up, and harsher measures against illegal immigrants would be taken, while legal immigration by citizens of civilized countries who come for work would be encouraged, with tax cuts and laws implemented to promote a re industrialisation of the region (which would require more labour).

A common currency of the Nordic Krona with a floating exchange rate, controlled by a federal central bank. Regions (such as those of finland) would also be allowed to introduce other official currencies, such as Euro.

true,[deleted],null,null,"**TL;DR: The UK will still exist, just without Scotland being named in it. Scottish independence could affect the rest of the UK in some odd little ways, but for NI and Wales to get independence, they'd have to call their own referendums which is highly unlikely due to the Troubles in NI and the poverty levels in Wales. Also, I ramble.**

If they wanted independence, they'd have to get referendums of their own. Northern Ireland is a possibility in the distant future I guess, but I'd imagine that the Troubles would be reignited full swing the second that it was mentioned. Wales is highly unlikely because their economy is very dependent on England, and also they've been part of the UK for the longest - they used to be counted as part of England actually.

The UK will, in theory, remain. It might change a bit, with regards to how budgeting works and how much the government is devolved to Wales and NI. Other than that, it should remain much the same though - there is no reason to change it any more than was changed when Ireland left in the early 20th century and when India and Hong Kong were both ""lost"" from the Empire. It might change some of the national services, such as trains and buses. Also, the conservative party would have a larger majority in the remaining UK as the Scots only voted one conservative MP in last election, so their power against the conservatives (not much, but still there) will be lost if everything else remains equal.

I kind of went into more depth than needed, but the general idea is that the UK will still exist - Scotland just won't be in the Great Britain part. It could be ""The United Kingdom of England, Wales and Northern Ireland"" or it could remain as-is, with the understanding being that Scotland isn't in Great Britain. Also, Scotland would be a bit more like Canada or Australia, where they are still very connected to the UK and in the Commonwealth, but they get to revive their national identity and have a different government due to different public opinion.

Oddly enough, most of the arguments for independence in Scotland are actually against Scottish independence for the rest of the UK and vice versa. The ""Better Together"" campaign, when not blocking roads while holding stupid signs (they're not a very good organisation, regardless of their message), claim that Scotland takes more money from the UK than it gives back making it unviable as an independent state, but in terms of the UK, if that were true (it's debatable, as different figures can be used), it would be better for Scotland to be gone and they're essentially using ""you're a parasite to the English"" as a reason for Scots to vote to stay with England, because it's a Scotland-only referendum - if it were the whole UK, they'd be trying to argue the opposite. Likewise, the whole ""we want a representative parliament who are more left wing with few conservatives"" will go the opposite for England - they'll have less left wing MPs to balance out the conservatives, but the idea with that is that the English people are voting conservative anyway so it won't matter if they have a stronger majority.

**Edit:** Also, if Scotland did get independence, it would set a precedence in the UK, making it either significantly easier (due to them having paved the way) or significantly harder (due to the government changing laws after to make it near impossible for it to happen again) for Wales or NI if they did want to leave. There's been jovial talks of Scotland, Wales, NI and RoI forming a ""Celtic Union"" but they're just 'what if's. It would also set precedence in Europe for Catalonia, Venice and any other areas who have had recent talks of independence. Catalonia especially could benefit from Scotland's independence, and vice versa.",0,1356232076,null,0,1356232463,0,c7kuqr5,t3_15a4j2,t1_c7kuqr5,t1_c7ku0p6,null,1430748619,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7
true,cb43569,SCOT,Scottish Socialist Republic,"Is it nationalist rhetoric you're hearing from civilian supporters of independence, or from political parties? I think the Scottish National Party and Scottish Greens have been challenged in pointing out how independence can appeal to everyone without alienating people in the process, but they've shown remarkable efforts to avoid the traditional nationalist sentiment, I've thought. They're trying to be clear that independence is not rooted in Anglophobia, and the independent Scottish government would work hard to maintain ties with the UK and EU through diplomacy.

So far, I'm swayed towards independence because I'm largely unimpressed by the state of UK politics, which I don't feel adequately represent me. The UK might have ""more influence"", but I'm never impressed with how it is used; we use our military might in illegal wars, our political sway to hamper progressive political movements, and we can't seem to reform anything without huge problems along the way. The AV referendum makes me honestly ashamed - a great shot at electoral reform ruined by Conservative-funded lies (honestly fabricated numbers). I don't want the independence referendum to go that way. House of Lords reform failed too.

We have a shot to take our parliament, which is unicameral and elected by proportional representation, which alone makes it more fair than Westminster, and hold it accountable for everything. I can trust an independent Scottish parliament more than I trust the UK government. They've defended healthcare, tried to remove nuclear weapons, spoken with true tact on the Gaza conflict, given us free university tuition and prescriptions like I believe we should. As far as I'm concerned, they are the voice of the Scottish people, and they shouldn't answer to Westminster nor be forced to abide the UK government's decision to tighten the Scottish budget to make us ""pay our share"".

If you want to have a game of numbers, I'd be happy to talk facts and figures with you, not to mention point out that the UK itself may find itself without that oh-so-important AAA credit rating soon (with its importance notably downplayed in the independence campaign as of late, as it becomes obvious it isn't a reliable argument), but I think I've essentially set out why I want Scottish independence. It gives the Scottish people the power to craft the country they want to live in, without restriction from Westminster, and without losing the deep cultural tie we have with the south.

Also, pro-western scholars in politics have to stop preaching about the 'Greek origins' of democracy as if everyone had a say and people lived hand-in-hand just jerking each other off in peace. The term *democracy* is not static. It has constantly evolved. It literally means power bestowed by the people. African tribes wherein power was based solely on seniority were inherently democratic since *the people* all believed in the system. Bitches could run it like an authoritarian dictatorship, but as long as the people had given the power to the leaders through blinded belief in the system it would still be a democracy.

That's what happens when the population of one country is 1% of the other. 

&gt;And that assumes that he would have.

And you're assuming he wouldn't have. I think my assumption is fair to make.

&gt;The law? I looked over some of the examples and the information provided checks out with external sources.

Really? Then kindly point me to the criteria used and how each case was classified. It doesn't appear on the linked page, which only had a yes/no in the field ""Weapons obtained legally?"" Mother Jones is an extremely biased publication with a clear agenda on the issue, I'm not going to take any assertion they make at face value without significant details.

&gt;I meant actually shooting them. In any military situation the majority of bullets are used for suppression, not actually to wound and/or kill.

Guerrilla warfare isn't traditional warfare. Bullets would be expended sparingly, probably in quick ambush attacks.

&gt;Why do people think that the prospect of a tyrannical government is realistic?

Every government eventually turns to tyranny. Did you pay attention to the 20th century? Americans want options besides a docile stroll into the cattle car. And the American government has been making serious strides down the path of tyranny in the last decades. It's started two belligerent wars in the last decade. It has a policy of kidnapping and torturing foreign nationals, some of which will be locked up without trial forever. It is now recording every call, SMS, and e-mail we send and has decided it doesn't need even the formality of a warrant to do so. Most importantly, it has recently decided that the head of the executive branch has the ability to kill a citizen and his minor son without trial or oversight. If you don't think the extrajudicial execution of minors because of the crimes of their fathers are a significant step on the road to tyranny, I think you may beyond the power of my arguments.

&gt;I was referencing the disproportionately higher homicide rate, not the proportion of guns. 

No, you were referring to killing innocent bystanders.

&gt;They have, and they've also happened in places with little to no regulation.. which is why we don't use specific examples to make a substantive case.

I'm sorry, what event has prompted this conversation?

&gt;So what you wrote was false after all.

I never said it in the first place. Try again.

&gt;No, then there'd be less homicides because most of them are done on-the-fly.

No, homicides would just be done with a different tool. ",0,1356239796,null,0,false,0,c7kwhmo,t3_14wlp6,t1_c7kwhmo,t1_c7ki5as,null,1430749504,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,mielove,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Who are the biggest victims of racism in Sweden?    
  
Hard to say. I'll go with Middle-Easterners. That's no scientific statement though. SD however has gained its main support from being an anti-Islam party.  
  
&gt;Why is racism talked about so much in Sweden? I mean - do you think it's a bigger issue in your country than in other places? Or are you guys just more concerned with getting it right?  
  
At the moment probably because of the rise of SD. They came from out of nowhere and suddenly entered parliament. They became the weigher and because the Alliance refused to cooperate with them they had to form a minority government. Poll projections show they're currently the third biggest party meaning other parties may be forced to work with them in the future.  
  
SD of course are also getting votes for a reason. They're a protest-party, after all. There's huge debates involving immigration, refugees, integration, etc in Sweden right now. As for racism being a bigger issue in Sweden than elsewhere? No. It has however been a taboo to talk negatively about immigration in the mainstream so now that people are finally talking about it because of SD there are a lot of heated opinions.

true,Intelensprotient,GERM,Germany,"&gt;Pavlovian conditioning deems to be Politically Correct (a dead giveaway by itself)

This can be repeated as often as you want (and it will be), it's still bullshit. I despise PC for the exact reason that it IS racist, sexist and a lot of other -ists in my opinion. By shifting the focus towards some characteristic that is deemed to make someone needy of special treatment, you are actually saying that those people cannot help themselves, and that they are weak, solely based on whatever characteristic you separate them by. Saying ""citizens of African descent are in need of our support"" is essentially not at all different from ""niggers are bums"". The only function this kind of language serves is making the person who uses it feel better about their own ""politically incorrect"" thoughts, which _everyone_ is bound to have at some point. (Don't kid yourself. Educated people only combat them with reason.)

Furthermore, changing the language does not help those who are discriminated against at all. This is called the euphemism / dysphemism treadmill. If a word is currently loaded with stereotypes, those will very quickly taint any new ""PC"" word that is forcibly introduced. This leads to more and more idiotic constructs that become tainted as well, which in turn lead a decrease in accuracy while increasing clutter and thus confusion. I've heard people calling others ""African-American"", just because they're used to that being the ""PC"" term, even if their family never originated from Africa and they're living in Germany.* All that while we have perfectly valid words for people with darker skin - ""black"", ""negro"" and so on are by themselves no more problematic than calling white people white. It's only their usage by people who wanted to create hatred that made others shun them. But will those agitators stop agitating? No, they will switch to the next ""acceptable"" word in order not to out themselves right away and the process repeats itself. 

And as for the clutter, I'd like to quote an essay from Switzerland where gender-neutral speech is law. Consider the sentence 

""Ein künftiger Lehrerberater sollte zuvor auch ein bewährter Schülerbetreuer gewesen sein.""  
(Roughly: ""A future teacher's advisor should have been a proven student's counsellor before."")

Politically correct, it becomes

""Ein künftiger Lehrer- bzw. Lehrerinnenbetreuer bzw. eine künftige Lehrer- bzw. Lehrerinnenbetreuerin sollte zuvor auch ein bewährter Schüler- bzw. Schülerinnenberater bzw. auch eine bewährte Schüler- bzw. Schülerinnenberaterin gewesen sein.""  
(Exactly the same thing, but emphasis is put on the biological sex of the people, rather than on the grammatical genus of ""Lehrer"", ""Schueler"" or ""Betreuer"". Also, it's extremely confusing because there are combined words that have to be made gender neutral, so student's counsellor becomes ""female or male student's female counsellor or female or male student's male counsellor"".)

And to some, this is still ""gender fascism"", so they require a Gender Gap or a Queer Star (for people between the sexes or completely outside traditional definitions of gender.) In addition to what I said above, these cases defeat the purpose of written language, as the latter constructs cannot be pronounced. (Though some extreme people even tried to introduce them in spoken form, by signalling the symbols with clicks like some African languages have.)

(Just to be clear, that example is fictional, but would have to be enforced by the law in question. This one is real, but less complex:   

""Der Kantonstierarzt und der leitende Tierarzt können auch die Funktion eines Fleischinspektors ausüben, der Kantonstierarzt, der leitende Tierarzt und der Fleischinspektor die eines Fleischkontrolleurs.""  

becomes  

""Der Kantonstierarzt beziehungsweise die Kantonstierärztin und der leitende Tierarzt beziehungsweise die leitende Tierärztin können auch die Funktion eines Fleischinspektors beziehungsweise einer Fleischinspektorin ausüben, der Kantonstierarzt beziehungsweise die Kantonstierärztin, der leitende Tierarzt beziehungsweise die leitende Tierärztin und der Fleischinspektor beziehungsweise die Fleischinspektorin die eines Fleischkontrolleurs beziehungsweise die einer Fleischkontrolleurin."" 

Again, no change in meaning, but it takes thrice as long to read and five times as long to understand.)

To sum this up, no, I will not let you call me racist or sexist for thinking that this is idiotic.

I know, but based on what? He went around Europe and couldn't get the ammo. If the US hadn't provided it to him it's highly unlikely that he would've had anywhere else to go. I doubt he would've sourced them from, say, an African country.

&gt; Really? Then kindly point me to the criteria used and how each case was classified. It doesn't appear on the linked page, which only had a yes/no in the field ""Weapons obtained legally?"" Mother Jones is an extremely biased publication with a clear agenda on the issue, I'm not going to take any assertion they make at face value without significant details.

Then feel free to read up on each and every case to confirm if they are 100% accurate. The ones that I looked up checked out on whether they got their weapons illegally or legally.

&gt; Guerrilla warfare isn't traditional warfare. Bullets would be expended sparingly, probably in quick ambush attacks.

&gt; Every government eventually turns to tyranny. Did you pay attention to the 20th century? Americans want options besides a docile stroll into the cattle car. And the American government has been making serious strides down the path of tyranny in the last decades. It's started two belligerent wars in the last decade. It has a policy of kidnapping and torturing foreign nationals, some of which will be locked up without trial forever. It is now recording every call, SMS, and e-mail we send and has decided it doesn't need even the formality of a warrant to do so. Most importantly, it has recently decided that the head of the executive branch has the ability to kill a citizen and his minor son without trial or oversight. If you don't think the extrajudicial execution of minors because of the crimes of their fathers are a significant step on the road to tyranny, I think you may beyond the power of my arguments.

If that's your definition of a tyrant, then the US has always had a tyrannical government. Wars? Torture? Kidnapping? Been done since the US' creation. It doesn't make those things right, of course, but it's not like the government is going to attack their own populace or resort to fascism.

Indefinite detention without trial is law. The President crying crocodile tears over the Connecticut children has killed ten times as my children himself. Tyranny is here, and it will only get worse.

No, you specifically claimed that guns killed innocent bystanders ""often"". This, given the large number of guns in the US, is clearly not true.

&gt;Your use of Anders Breivik as evidence that gun control doesn't work. 

This conversation is happening because a man in Connecticut, an ""outlier"" according to you, killed a bunch of kids. You can't try to grab guns because of one ""anecdote"" and ignore the contrary evidence provided by another.

The emperor, nominal big boss (who in reality had to negotiate for almost anything, especially later on), the electors? The landed nobility? The regular folk? 

Not to mention the title of this thread, to be honest; it wasn't European disunion done right. It was European and disunion, fair enough, but I'm not sure about 'done right'. The HRE, after all, was very instable rather often, and the fact that later emperors had to fight far more than, say, the kings of France, in order to enact anything all through their realm made it far less powerful than a realm of that size might have been. The internal instability in and of it self may also well have been the cause (and opportunity) for that one backwood and barely Christened region to become (or well, lend its name) to what would become the leading and dominant military power of Europe, especially after French military hegemony ended with the defeat of Napoleon III. (And no, France didn't surrender all the time, ha ha ha. ) 

 Furthermore, I disagree with their assessment that the geographic similarity ended with Charlemagne's death; on the contrary. What would become the Western Frankic part is now more or less France plus bits of Belgium, the middle part is pretty much what would become Burgundy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the rest of Belgium, Switzerland and parts of the Rhineland. East Francia became more or less what is now Germany, only  with less eastern expansion.

Yes, people were more free than in the absolutist countries, and it was relatively peaceful except when it wasn't.

And yes, rulers of some of those territories that weren't large enough for military glory sought to make their mark in history by attracting the great thinkers of their time and this spawned cultural and scientific centers in a few of them. If you have 300 rulers, some of them will probably decide to fund the arts.

""God made me this way"" or the similar ""I was born this way""

The reason I do not like that argument is that I feel as if the people using it as making excuses. Rather than say I want this for myself or I like it, they say I was made this way in one fashion or another, and that they had no decision whatsoever.

The other argument is that perhaps they are slightly true which I didn't really address or think of when I wrote that is that we can only rarely control which chemicals fire in our brain in response to which stimuli.But these do change, whether it is the love of an individual or the love of an activity. I just find it hard to believe that, for example, every man that has ever walked down the wedding isle to marry a women and later decided that they enjoyed men were to put it bluntly, lying through their teeth and their whole life prior to the act of loving a man was a lie.

**CUSTOMS**

It's fairly standard — Christmas Eve is the big event, and that's also when we exchange presents. Some families do the whole Santa Claus thing, in which case a dad or uncle dresses up and brings presents to the kids, some families don't.

Christmas trees have the usual decorations, plus we tend to decorate ours with the national flag — which doesn't have as much of a nationalist aura as in other countries, it's just seen as festive. One thing that people from other countries find unusual is that we dance around the Christmas tree on Christmas Eve — that is, the whole family and whoever is present forms a circle, joining hands, and sings a few Christmas carols and songs while walking around the tree and beholding its magnificence. :D

**FOOD**

Most people have either duck or pork roast with gravy, boiled potatoes, and two dishes that may be unfamiliar to non-Scandinavians: [Chopped, boiled, and sweetened red cabbage](http://www.duda.dk/Grundfag/Kristendom/Jul/julemad/roedkaal/roedkaal002.jpg), and [candied boiled potatoes](http://www.dk-kogebogen.dk/billeder-opskrifter/billeder/7425/4_300.jpg).

For dessert, the traditional dish is [risalamande](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risalamande), which is cold rice pudding mixed with chopped almonds, fresh vanilla, and whipped cream, usually eaten with warm cherry sauce. Usually there is a single whole almond in the bowl, and the person who finds it gets an extra present or a treat.",0,1356271524,null,0,false,0,c7l0i96,t3_15bqn2,t1_c7l0i96,t3_15bqn2,null,1430751396,49,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,49

We do that with porridge, and on the day before Christmas Eve. The winner gets a marzipan pig. 

Our traditions are quite similar to the Danes, for obvious reasons. The 'dance around the tree' thing is here too, but I doubt it extends much outside of families with small children. 

The by far two most common dishes on Christmas Eve (which is the *big* day) are pretty much [pork] (http://www.norsk-akevitt.org/avApr/objects/Arne-Brimis-ribbe.jpg) and [lamb](http://www.matsiden.no/images/artikler/Pinnekj%C3%B8tt.JPG). My family have both. 

On Christmas Day, at least *my* extended family has a tradition where we go to each other to eat good food. We used to rotate between two, but now there are three different families who do once every three years (as my youngest uncle got a family). I don't know whether this is a common Norwegian tradition or not, it's just how we've always done it.

Dress up in traditional peasant clothes. Then we have a parade in the front there are bulls with their nuts cut that are carrying a giant [Olentzero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olentzero). There is also candy and roasted chestnuts. The people in the parade dance and sing 
and we also have [kalejira](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passacaglia). When the parade finishes we burn Olentzero and drink hot chocolate. 

At dinner we just eat more elaborate and fancy food than usual, seafood is big at this time. Foie gras, good embutidos. Then for dessert we eat the typical spanish sweets like turron(duro or blando), mazapan, polvoron(the best ones are made in Vitoria-Gasteiz our capital). We do have a basque christmas eve dessert and that is intxaursaltsa. Then we sing basque christmas carols and drink with the family.

Next morning when we wake up we will have Olentzeros presents and a big family lunch.

edit:My galician family always eats lamb. I hate it but...
Also there is one person in charge of bread and up to 20-30 baguettes will be bought since the 25 there is no bread so we have to buy it in advanced. This is probably the most important job. If you  fail oh boy!

It's quite noisy as people are louder than average. There will definitely be a lot of getting used to things and people, that's for sure. I've lived here for several years now and the tranquilo mentality still gets to me sometimes. I live with my wife and we total roughly 1500 per month in living expenses without cutting corners, as in we're not trying to save money. Add leisure and fun on top. Public transportation is good and cheap (0.9 per trip if you get a 10-trip pass). One thing to note though is I didn't like living in Barcelona itself, for many reasons, I live in a small town just outside of Barcelona (it's surrounded by towns like that). It's called Castelldefels, it has much less crime, a slower pace of things, way less tourists and a closer community. It's a cleaner place and the beaches here are second to none, Barceloneta (Barcelona's beach) just can't compare. It's also a 30 minute train ride to the very center of Barcelona, which is less than it takes many people living in the city to get to the center.
 I'd say - go for it, absolutely. If you happen to lose a job then severance pay is good in Spain, so that should not be a problem. Take note though, that if you don't speak Castellano/Catala and don't know anyone then you will be looking for an apartment via an agency, most of which want 10% of yearly or 1 monthly pay for their services, which isn't cheap. On top of that landlords will generally be expecting a deposit of two monthly payments, so if you've found a place with 800 monthly fee, then you're looking at roughly 3000 euros to move in, because they will also expect you to pay one month in advance. It is possible to find apartments without agency. Some landlords will want yearly insurance with is ~400 euros.
Also, internet is utter shit in Spain, expensive too.
TL;DR - If you're young and single, then stop thinking and start moving. Make sure you have enough money for a deposit or make arrangements with your employer regarding housing during the first month or so. I'm yet to meet a person who regretted moving to Barcelona.

By this I mean that surely disenfranchised catalans who are unemployed should feel they have more in common with striking miners and struggling galicians and castillians rather than their respective ruling class which arguably has not really felt the brunt of the economic crisis. How valid would you deem what I'm saying? is there something i'm missing?

**Customs**:

I guess the most significant habiit it's getting all family together, a good amount of people leaves cities and go to their family origins houses in villages in the interior of the country.

Usually exchange presents, this year with the pressure of some euro-'friends' with the internal economy being trashed, much less and in many cases agreement to not buy presents for each other, except for children.

The Bolo-Rei cake usually cames with a broad bean hidden inside, who gets the broad bean pays for the next Bolo-Rei!

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"&gt;I don't have an issue with people having issues with certain practices, but with those who try to plug those attitudes unnecessarily, especially if they word those statements in a disrespectful way. Homosexuals' desire to have the option to have their relationship with their long-term partner officially recognized by society and secure the same legal status that heterosexual couples have always taken for granted has preciously little to do with them ""fucking each other in their asses"". And it's not as if many heterosexual couples wouldn't enjoy anal sex, either.

Yes, I agree. Hence my downvote for him. I disliked his answer too, and one can guess that it might stem from a sense of having to appear opposed to it.

&gt; Actually, it might well do.

I am sceptical towards such statements. It is a neat hypothetis that fits with many of our beliefs. But even then, getting a strong correlation between being a homophobe (and you'd be required to pinpoint exactly what makes you that, and to what extend) and a closet homosexual will be rather difficult.

Consider the following: in societies in which *all* males are brought up in behaving hostile towards homosexuals, do you really think all homophobes are going to be secretly homosexual? That is, biologically speaking, highly unlikely. But then, how are you going to differentiate? Why is it different for societies in which there is a less homophobic upbringing or peer group for most men? 

&gt;The prejudice of homophobia may also stem from authoritarian parents, particularly those with homophobic views as well, the researchers added.

Is quoted directly from the article to support my point.

Furthermore, there is a certain mathematical problem when dealing with one particular person and attempting to use statistics to decipher their behaviour. Even if you can find a considerable correlation, this tells you nothing at all about how this correlation comes into being. But worse, the individual you are dealing with is essentially detatched from your statistical findings. This is one of the greatest problem of frequentist probability most people do not get - one random experiment is as good as none at all. It has no information. Only if you get to a high number of persons, you can make informed estimations.

true,NME24,AUST,Australia,"Interesting research by Mr. Tenenbom. What's clear to us from the headlines and broadcasts are people's (particularly Europeans') manifested reactions to other races, but never the depths of the psyche where the root of a problem can be truly found. Conscious reasoning often takes you nowhere with a racist.

His ""eight in ten"" statistic was alarming for me, until I read what it was based on:

&gt;Tenenbom defines anti-Semitism as a belief that Jews hold vast power relative to their numbers, that they are obsessed with money and that Israel is solely or overwhelmingly responsible for the conflict with the Palestinians. 

I don't know whether to be disappointed or relieved, but his results are definitely exaggerated because the definition was objectively *wrong*. 

Anti-Semitism is a serious phrase and should not be tossed around lightly, in Germany of all places. It encompasses simple, dumb hatred. Not the observation that relative to their numbers, the Jewish people are pretty high-achieving, due to historical and socio-economic factors that would take another wall of text to discuss. And in contrast with such a troubled past! Like every Jewish person I've befriended or met, I'm sure Mr. Tenenbom would happily, at least humbly acknowledge this. Why get upset when others notice and automatically assume a case of tall poppy syndrome, when many other cultures are snidely frowned upon for being ""ignorant"" or ""uncivilized""? That perspective in Europe poses a much larger threat at the moment. It's a source of my relief that the findings aren't entirely correct, since the only clear criteria for anti-Semitism would be the second, which brings me to the main point:

I am frustrated as always to see people who support the Palestinian cause instantly branded as ""anti-Semetic"" or ""self-hating Jews"" (self-hating, honestly? ridiculous). There are many humanitarian motives for condemning Israeli policy, and if you disagree with that, by all means discuss it - just don't resort to strawman labels. We could do without that narrow dichotomy of thinking.

In fact I would go even further to argue that many are inclined to support Israel do so out of a far uglier subconscious bigotry, one cultivated by selective journalism which presents the Arab people as angry but fails to reveal why, shows men rallying in the streets without the wives and children they aim to protect, reports killings by Arabs rather than the killings of Arabs, which are *unimaginably* greater in number.

The truest irony of all shines through when people like myself try to point out the ethnocentrism of Israel, and its failure to provide equal rights - and are called racist for it.

Customs:  
Christmas Eve (Heiliger Abend) is most important day of the Christmas holidays. This is the night where we exchange gifts with close family, friends or with your partner. The [ Christmas Tree](http://imgur.com/ROj6p) (either a traditional like this one with straw figures or a modern one with Christmas balls and sometimes sweets) is put up on this day, not before. That's because the presents and the tree come together, the [Christkind](http://imgur.com/fQAfF) (either baby Jesus in angel form or a female angel with blond curles) traditionally brings it. Entering the room while the Christkind ist working is forbidden of course, it would disappear in a second! Due to american media influences the Weihnachtsmann is becoming a thing here too, but we settled now for a compromise where they work together. 

All bars, restaurants, shops are closed by 2 PM, bars are allowed to reopen at 10.

There is no fixed time line in what happens when, in my case for example I'll visit me parents at 6 o'clock, we will eat, drink some beer and wine, exchange gifts, talk some more and by 8 or 9 I'm out of there. Then I will drive to some friends and we will continue to drink and talk. Traditionally between 1 or 2 AM I'm walking home slightly drunk.

The 25th and 26th are the typical ""meeting the larger family"" celebrations, that means visiting your grandparents and meeting cousins and other relatives you only see once a year. Everybody does it, everybody hates it :) Those are the typical banking holidays, just like Sundays, bars and restaurants open, shops not. 

Food:

**Customs**

I'll describe Christmas as it was when I was a kid. It was better then.

*Christmas Eve* - we'd have a Christmas Eve 'brunch' (see: Food) with some family friends. Exchange gifts, play board games (our favourite is one called Balderdash - you're given a random word and you have to make up a definition for the word, then you all vote on which one you think is right. Great game). When they left, we'd probably settle down as a family and watch a festive movie or something. We might have a light dinner.

Before we go to bed, we'd make sure our stockings were hung and we'd leave a mince pie out for Father Christmas and a small glass of sherry, and a bowl of water and some carrots for his reindeer.
I later found my dad would deliberately messily eat all of it and leave crumbs behind - tell-tale signs that Father Christmas has been here.

*Christmas Day*

Wake up, when everyone's awake we'd eat a light breakfast and then open presents. When we were kids, my brother and I would open our presents first, then mum and dad would open theirs. Now we each take a turn to open a present.
Chill for the morning, help mum cook dinner, when guests arrived (if anyone is coming over, this christmas it's just us) we'd entertain, chat, blah blah blah, all that nonsense.
We'd have dinner, and then the afternoon would be kept for board games and drinking and music.

We're not very 'singy', so singing and dancing is not the sort of thing we would do. When it got late and if we were hungry we'd eat some snacks, party food mostly. If guests are with us, they'd stay late. If not, we'd probably just chill with some cards.

The town I used to live in, our road was well known for all the christmas lights, so we might take a walk to look at them dependant on weather.

*Boxing day*

Normally Boxing day would be Christmas day but for family who we didn't share christmas day with. Basically the same as Christmas Day, except the meal is different.

**Food**

*Christmas eve*

Brunch consisting of croissants, bacon, sausages, toast, jams, spreads, fruit, yoghurt, eggs etc.
Light dinner of sandwiches, cake etc

*Christmas Day*

Breakfast consisting of orange juice/bucks fizz (Champagne and OJ) and toast/cereal/fruit
Dinner is huge - yorkshire puddings, stuffing, broccoli, carrots, roast potatoes, parsnips, swede, pigs in blankets (cocktail sausages wrapped in streaky bacon), and then our meat - this varies, sometimes we have turkey if there's lots of us, other times we have a pre-prepared duck in a duck in a duck (chicken inside duck inside turkey, something like that). Just a small joint, enough for 4 people and sandwich leftovers.
Dessert - big deal in my house because my mum is an awesome cook. Usually consists of a combination of christmas pudding, cake, trifle, eton mess (meringues mixed with cream and berries and sugar), or some other delight. This year she's just making trifle and cheesecake.

*Boxing Day*

Same as Christmas day, except the meat is cold.

**TL:DR** Christmas just isn't as good as it used to be - family has dwindled, 'spirit' is obviously reduced because of Santa, have reduced my desire for 'stuff', so that's not an exciting part for me anymore.

The best bit about christmas for me this year is that my friend whom I've known since I was born is coming over on Boxing day for the day with his family, will be great fun.",0,1356281404,null,0,false,0,c7l25q0,t3_15bqn2,t1_c7l25q0,t3_15bqn2,null,1430752174,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

But to be sure, the normal rule is, that after long vocals or double vocals (ie, ei) there has to be a sharp ß. E.g.: ""Floß"" [flo:s] or ""heißen"". Written with ""ss"", a german would pronounce the vocal short, like [flos] which would lead to misunderstanding.
After short vocals like ""Pass"" or ""Schuss"", there has to be a double s [pas], otherwise, germans would pronounce the vocal longer ""Paß"" [pa:s], which would lead to misunderstanding.
Of course, there are some cases - in German there are always exceptions - where it is not clear. So ""Straße"" can also be written ""Strasse"" becaues it is not clear wheter or not the vocal is short or long...

true,bas-bas,ESTE,"Catalonia, not Spain","&gt; It seems to me the catalan demand for secession/independence has gained momentum from the economic crisis, how much would you agree with this?

Not really, the main reason for the current boost is the 2005-2006 negotiation of the Catalan Statute and the 2010 sentence of the Constitutional Court on that affair. Especially the way it was considered by the Spanish media. I guess an economic crisis means that people are generally a bit more interested in politics, but the criticism of our fiscal imbalance has been widely accepted by the Catalan public for the last 20 years. The feeling that all ""our"" proposals have been useless is what has driven most people into separatism.

&gt; do you think there is an element of selfishness that feeds the movement? 

Yes, but I would rather call it ""not liking being ripped off"". 

&gt; By this I mean that surely disenfranchised catalans who are unemployed should feel they have more in common with striking miners and struggling galicians and castillians rather than their respective ruling class which arguably has not really felt the brunt of the economic crisis.

I guess so... but why would they feel have more in common with struggling galicians than with striking greeks? Many places in Europe are in a tough situation. I am not sure what you mean in here.

&gt; To what extent are you concerned with the way a catalan secession would affect the rest of Spain? 

It will force them to change their unchangeable constitution and their inefficient government system, and I hope that they will move towards a more democratic and transparent system. With the current discontentment towards politicians, taking a different path would create an unbearable situation of public unrest.

&gt; Would you accept full federation as an alternative to independence?

Personally I would not, but a decent proposal would probably be supported by the majority of the Catalan population. However it would need to imply real power for Catalonia and right now it seems impossible to get a proposal like that from the Spanish government.",0,1356284697,null,0,false,0,c7l2w2x,t3_15a4j2,t1_c7l2w2x,t1_c7l11ti,null,1430752526,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,rensin,POLA,Poland,"to your 1st question: when speaking of poland would you call the instance on recreating a polish state, polish nationlism or simply foreign rejection? as in the polish case there is a need to be nationalistic in Catalunya to maintain our cultural identity and not get drowned out by Spanish influence. I personally feel that once Independence is achieved and the aftermath of ""patting ourselves on the back"" subside nationalism will go down to what you would find in your average EU country.

To your second question: I think spain still has an afterglow of it's civil war in politics, meaning that the two main political groups are somewhat socialist and/or facist. the Spaniards will use in the short to mid term future a populist Spanish sentiment to gain votes (as does catalunya with a populist catalan sentiment) so the oppressive policies will continue and catalunya will continue fighting back. Thus I do not think that a full federation could work unless the Spanish and Catalan politicians can remove these old sentiments from politics and really look eye to eye and respect one another, this hasn't happened for years and history has its way of sticking around, and we need a change of policies now, not wait another 10-15 years before the governments decides to be courteous to one anther (which may or may not happen). 

3rd Question: I feel neither of your ""options"" is correct with what I (me speaking for myself not a representative of all Catalans) beleive. I ""expect the rich to give more than the poor and feel that this should logically follow on a national scale"". In fact I believe that it is vitally important! (there is that socialist afterglow). 
However I believe the catalan sentiment is like that of the germans towards spain ""why should I give my money to them if they are not enacting enough changes so they wont constantly ask for more in the future"". Germany is more productive than I believe all EU countries, just as catalans are more productive than most of the rest of spain,the diffrence is germany is in a voulantary union with spain, more so it has the power to ask for reform before giving them money, and Catalans do not. Germany can collect its own taxes and then decide what it wants to do with it, unlike catalunya that its tax revenue is taken directly to madrid and we get the leftovers which are close to none. but not to worry spain does give us a very generous amount of debt which is crippling our government. So does national identity create exceptional circumstances? no especially not with other groups such as the Basques, Valencians (is that the English term i dunno), Galicians etc.... but I do think Catalan national/cultural identity helps productivity levels.

**Christmas Eve** - nothing. Travel if you wanna be somewhere ready for christmas morning. No opening your presents!

**Christmas day**: up earlier than normal. Nothing to eat for breakfast. Younger member of the family hands out presents, the idea being that you unwrap them one by one so everyone can see what each person gets. Descends into a freeforall by the end, and of course there's a lot of feigning joy and surprise at what you got. 

Lunch is served! This is toasted with a christmas cracker, which is a cardboard tube with an exposive inside (!) that you pull with your neighbour at the table. When it pops, out falls a paper hat, a joke and a really crap toy. You take it in turns to tell your jokes, groan and explain to the group which toy you got. Then the food: Turkey with potatoes, veg, brussels sprouts (which no one, including the cook, likes and only come out at christmas), gravy, pigs in blankets. Pudding can be a number of things, including christmas cake (which no one likes, see sprouts), christmas pudding (which no one likes, see sprouts and christmas cake), trifle or cheesecake. 

You then move over to the lounge and sit down feeling the full force of the amount of food you've had send you into a post-prandial coma. Around 3PM is the Queen's Christmas Message on most of the regular TV channels simultaneously - a look back on the year (will include the olympics and jubilee) and usually contains a rather oddly religious message (the UK, whilst celebrating christmas and being traditionally christian, is mostly areligious now, with most real religionists being old or immigrants).

By the end of the day one of the non-sattelite channels has managed to use half its annual budget to purchase a blockbuster from the last 5 years or so to screen, so you might end up watching that, or a plethora of nostalgic talking-heads type shows where people go ""ooh, who remembers 1973?!""

**Dec 26th: Boxing day!** In the old days this was the day when you gave a box of presents to the people who worked for your family in your house (if you were rich enough). These days it means eating the cold turkey. 

The whole next week: turkey sandwiches, turkey curry, turkey trifle, turkey icecream, turkey milkshakes... you get the idea.

**Then new years eve and new years day** 

25th,26th and 1st Jan are all mandatory days off work (you get them off in leiu if you work a job that requires it, such as in a hospital or 365 call centre. There is NO public transport on the 25th.

true,goerz,ITAL,Italy,"This is my experience in Italy, but please consider that traditions vary greatly on a regional level.
Christmas Eve is less important than Christmas day itself, which lasts 2 days and includes Dec. 26th. On Christmas Eve there may be a light supper, usually based on fish. My family always skipped this part. Sometimes family members exchange gifts, if children are past the Santa Claus phase, otherwise it's done on Christmas day morning. Sometimes we play tombola, a sort of bingo. Mass at midnight.
On Christmas day we have a sumptuous family lunch at home, an affair which can last for several hours and requires a prodigious appetite. There's no fixed menu, but after an appetizer there are usually [cappelletti in brodo](http://www.adgblog.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/cappelletti-in-brodo.jpg) (meat stuffed pasta in a turkey soup) as a first course. Second course is usually stuffed  roasted turkey, but it can really be any other meat. Dangerous quantities of wine, spumante (Italian champagne wine) and [grappa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappa) are also consumed. Traditional sweets are [panettone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panettone), [pandoro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandoro), and [torrone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrone). Dried fruit, oranges and tangerines complete the picture.
December 26th is also a holiday, and those unfortunate enough to have a large family must endure another lunch, with another side of the family, although usually not as lavish as the Christmas lunch. Choosing one side of the family over the other for the main Christmas lunch can cause years of bitterness and resentment from the ""ignored"" side.",0,1356291717,null,0,1356291939,0,c7l4mzs,t3_15bqn2,t1_c7l4mzs,t3_15bqn2,null,1430753417,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

In a nation that has no realistic threat for the visible few next decades it makes it a hot topic of discussion wether we need an army at all or not. So obviously each time our army needs to replace big ticket items (Fighters being the most obvious of those) this sparks a huge debate wether or not we really need to spend money on them.

Couple that with a direct democracy which insists on popular votes for such big ticket military purchases and you have a recipee for a lot of debate.

Hungary won't comply, some time will pass, it will eventually get a strongly worded letter saying ""you'll get a fine"", and then it will change the national legislation.

So the german history has caused that some Nazi signs and Stuff are just forbidden and not covered under free speech. Also hate speech and stuff, things like Westboro Baptist Church etc., would never happen in Germany.

Another point is the INDIZIERUNG, this is what we probably talk about here. Like everywhere, there are different age levels for all kinds of media. And for some games or movies you have to be at least 18.
And there's an even harder point, when authorities ""beschlagnahmen"" (=confiscate) games/movies/books.  This means, that these articles are not allowed to be sold by retailer or other salesman anymore. It is not illegal to own these articles, you may just not officially sell them.

So easy (?)

Short:
No Nazi stuff (history)
No hate speech and other bullshit that is illegal in terms of our Grundgesetz (German Constitution)
Free speech is part of the Grundgesetz, though. So it's always a decision of a court, they need to decide for every case which law is more important (normally, the right of a possible victim weighs much more than the right of free speech - makes sence, when you look at hate speech and stuff)

And gore is kind of illegal to sell. But also here, a court needs to decide wether to ban or not. This is highly controversial btw.
For example, DOOM was banned in the 90ies. Some years ago the unbanned it again. Make no sence. But ok, in times of the internet, no one really cares anymore about it (it is banned? Torrent or import...)

It stems from not knowing about what happened on 16 September 1992, Black Wednesday in British economic history.   And not knowing about it's aftermath. 

And I level no criticism at anyone who doesn't know about this because why should they?

On that date, 16 Sept 1992,  the pound fell out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), the precursor to the euro.   The ""Daddy"" of the euro.    

The pound, sterling, the UK currency proved on that date it could not retain it's value in a c. 2.25% trading range against a basket of european currencies including the West German mark .

Despite the UK government spending as much as it could afford, billions, back in the day when billions were a lot of pounds, the UK currency fell through the lower band and out of the ERM.

And the pound being unable to maintain a stable level against a basket of european currencies was unable to be a part of the euro.

Very bad news obviously and the Europeans all laughed at the British, still the sick man of europe.

This happened in September 1992.

In August 1993 the French Franc came under the same pressure.

But the currency bands, the tolerances, were moved from c. 2.25% for the pound to 15.00% for the Franc.

So obviously, the Franc stayed in the system, which is what the pound would have done if the pound had the support the Franc did. 

In the circumstances, of the Germans and French clearly stitching up the British back in 1992 .... the British have been very well mannered and civilised to remain as engaged as they have over the last 20 years.

You probably would've been right if you were writing this a year ago. At this moment, [50.3% of all UN members](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Kosovo) recognize Kosovo as independent, and the trend will only continue. The countries that don't recognize it can quite easily be put into two groups:

1. countries that have their own minorities to oppress so they can't recognize other country's minorities (Spain, Slovakia, Romania, China)

2. countries who have no clue where Kosovo is and aren't important enough to be pressured by the US &amp; EU to do so (Nepal, Madagascar)

\+ Russia is a category in itself, since it likes ti ""stick it"" to the US and because Serbia handed over its strategic resources just to get some ""brotherly"" help

Countries from group 2) will continue to recognize Kosovo one-by-one if they have nothing better to do. Countries from group 1) might do so at some point in the future, if they manage to solve their own minority problem. Russia will probably never recognize it unless Serbia does so, and since it has veto power, Kosovo might stay out of the UN for a long time.

Also, demographics might be interesting in the future. Kosovo continues to have the highest birth rate in Europe. Serbia has something like the lowest growth. In just a few decades the situation will be that the Serbia of 5- million is asking the Kosovo of 5+ million to ""come back"".",0,1356304773,null,0,false,0,c7l7tgs,t3_159zpg,t1_c7l7tgs,t1_c7l37fp,null,1430754916,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

The train is a great option for travel, as well as the bus, for short trips. Sometimes it is well worth it to pay more for a train ticket rather than to languish all day on the bus. For example, taking the high-speed train from Madrid to Barcelona is relatively painless, and will allow you plenty of time for a weekend trip. Taking a bus is about a fourth of the cost, but takes up to eight hours one way, which is less than ideal.

Fun places to go in Madrid depends on what you're into, I guess, but seeing Parque Retiro in the spring would be nice, and you should check out Templo de Debod. As you said, nightclubs are numerous, and fun, but Madrid is more than La Marcha.

Also, speak Spanish, even if you're afraid of making mistakes. A lot of younger folks do speak English, but unless you are really having a communication failure, try to stick to Spanish.

I know you didn't ask, but bring slightly dressier clothes than the usual college student uniform (hooded sweatshirt, sneakers, etc.) .

Each region has its own typical Christmas dishes, so it's impossible to list them all. Southern regions tend to focus on fish, northern regions on meat, but anything goes, really, and this is also the occasion to prepare complex, incredibly caloric dishes that almost never get made otherwise.

Decorations include a Christmas tree with lights and decorations, and often a nativity scene, especially if the family is at least a bit religious. Nativity scenes, called 'presepio' can be very simple or large engineering projects with handcrafted statues. Naples is famous for the number of artisans that make them, ranging from the 'serious' to the satyrical (like Berlusconi as Jesus, or stuff like that).

Some families exchange gifts at midnight between the 24th and 25th, especially if there are kids around, possibly making presents appear under the tree after distracting the kids and claiming that Santa brought them. Some others go to mass and do the deal on the morning of the 25th.

After the food orgy you have a few days of rest, then on the evening of the 31st there's ANOTHER megameal. This is often done at a restaurant with friends (usually for a price of 50-100€ each), but it's not uncommon to organize a home dinner in which everyone brings something different. Then there's games and drinking until the new year arrives.

Finally, the 6th of january is another holiday called 'epifania', in which a old hag/witch is supposed to bring chocolate to good kids and coal to bad kids.

&gt;Obama has sworn fealty to Israel - His campaign manager Axelrod, is tied to the Israeli agent Rahm Emmanuel, the Israeli Defence Force veteran who is a Representative for a district in Chicago, who ran the Congressional Election campaign for the Democrats, and made sure that anti war candidates didn't get the support from the party.

&gt;Obama's foreign policy handler Ziggy Brzezinski thought that America needed a new Pearl Harbor to rally people to war, he got it on 9-11, when elements in the Regime and their Israeli accomplices carried out the false flag attack on America.

&gt;9-11 was an inside job! The biggest conspiracy theory is the official fable of 9-11 in which 19 Arabs who could not fly jetliners, seven of whom are still living, rammed planes into the WTC and Pentagon.

**The FBI has admitted that they have no case against bin Laden for 9-11...they don''t even want him for it on their website.**

&gt;They cleaned up around the Kennedy assassination...they cleaned up around the Clintons... around OKC.. these people murdered a police officer...Officer Yeakey who knew too much and was looking too closely at the real perpetrators of the April 19 attack on the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.

&gt;Before World War I was launched, the bankers needed a credit mechanism to create the credit necessary to wage the war...and, conveniently, they also passed a Income Tax Amendment to give the power to the banker regime the ability to tax incomes, to pay for the ''loans'' that Uncle Sucker would need to wage war.

&gt;Look at the lowest income earners in America, the bulk of whose income goes to food, transportation and housing...the official inflation figures...like the official story of 9-11, comes from the same crock of feces.

**Yet this Regime promotes free trade with nations whose daily wages are less than the hourly wages of our workers .. why are we at war in Iraq and Afghanistan?**

Some more traditions:

Put some straw (could be a small little bundle, or it can be strewn across the table) under the table cloth to symbolize how Jesus was born on straw in a manger.

In many parts of eastern Poland (and parts of western Poland where Poles from former eastern Poland were deported after WWII, and much of Ukraine), a traditional dish called [Kutia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutia) is eaten, which is basically a sweet grain dish made with milk, honey, poppy seeds, and nuts (though the ingredients vary a bit from region to region).

Presents are typically opened the night of Christmas Eve, either before or after the midnight mass. A funny thing to see is oftentimes when you go to midnight mass in smaller villages you will see men come to church with sausage and vodka packed away in their coats, so that right after the mass is concluded they can begin eating meat and drinking heavily.

&gt; Havia ainda a tradição de que os cristãos deveriam comer 12 Bolos Reis, entre o Natal e o Dia de Reis, festa que muito cedo começou a ser celebrada na côrte dos reis de França. O Bolo Rei terá, aliás, surgido neste país no tempo de Luis XIV para as festas do Ano Novo e Dia de Reis. Vários escritores da época escreveram sobre esta iguaria, até mesmo Greuze celebrou-o num famoso quadro, com o nome de Gâteau dês Róis. Com a Revolução Francesa em 1789 este bolo foi proibido, ""como mais tarde iria acontecer em Portugal"", só que os pasteleiros que tinham um excelente negócio em mãos em vez de o eliminarem decidiram continuar a confeccioná-lo chamando-lhe Gâteau dês Sans-cullotes. Com isto parece não haver dúvidas que o Bolo Rei tem verdadeiras origens francesas, apesar do Bolo Rei popularizado em Portugal no século passado não ter a ver com o bolo simbólico da festa dos reis existente na maior parte das províncias francesas a norte do rio Loire, na região de Paris, onde o bolo é uma rodela de massa folhada recheada de creme. O nosso Bolo Rei segue a receita a sul de Loire, um bolo em forma de côroa feito de massa leveda.

&gt; They have. There are Presidential hit lists with American names on them. Citizens and children have already been murdered. Drones have already begun to fly in American skies. Indefinite detention without trial is law. The President crying crocodile tears over the Connecticut children has killed ten times as my children himself.

IIRC the figure for just innocent people being shot in something they weren't involved in was 1100~. Even if only this is taken in to account (and the other 10k+ gun homicides are ignored) the US' rate is still higher than other developed countries.

&gt; This conversation is happening because a man in Connecticut, an ""outlier"" according to you, killed a bunch of kids. You can't try to grab guns because of one ""anecdote"" and ignore the contrary evidence provided by another.
Translation: we only use examples that work in our favor. Examples that work against use are clearly invalid.

Nice bullshit strawman and projection.

I haven't used an anecdote yet. The one basing his arguments around examples is you. Stop being such a dishonest cunt.

&gt; This is not me ""strawmanning gun control by pretending that it claims to stop all gun violence"".

Wrong again.

You claim that these examples are examples of ""failure"" of gun control. The logical inference is that you think it claims to stop all crime, which is an asinine assumption on your part.

&gt; They are failures of gun control. Gun control was implemented and hundreds of millions of people were stripped of their natural rights. In exchange, their societies got nothing, and spree killers are still able to terrorize them.

Good job on directly contradicting yourself. Above this paragraph you denied that you considered these examples to be failures of gun control.

&gt; The ""data"" you've pointed to so far is a vague study of a propaganda group, utterly without substantiation or sourcing.

Of course, we *all* know about Harvard's bias.

&gt; Then why do countries without legal gun ownership have a higher incidence of knife **crime** than the US? 

Define ""knife crime"".

&gt; You're trying to pin the failings of society and people on an inanimate object.

Food overall though is in my opinion the best part of Christmas.

First the meat, either a turkey or sometimes a roast of some description, then thousands of crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside roast potatoes (if there are not thousands you are doing it wrong), loads of stuffing (preferably sage and onion but others are appropriate), pigs-in-blankets (sausages wrapped in bacon) lots of these and perhaps even some nice large yorkshire puddings. Finally the veg; roast parsnips, steamed carrots, tureens of peas and runner beans, maybe some cabbage and I suppose if you like that sort of thing some broccoli.

And I'll add a section for where to live / how to rent a piso.

**WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVE (things to check out):**

* Parque del Retiro: A beautiful park located east of Sol. I would walk there from Sol up calle prado because you pass through a really nice neighborhood. In the park, make sure you see both ponds, the peacock park, and the rose garden. I would skip the modern art museum, it's okay but there are better ones and you'll get sick of them. On the way back, head by Banco de España, it neighbors the park.
* Templo de Debod: When the weather is nice, tons of people come here to hacer botellón at nights, but even when it's cold it's worth coming here checking out the sunset and view of the city. The temple itself is incredibly old and was gifted to Spain by the Egyptions for their help in preserving arabic monuments.
* Palacio Real + San Francisco el Grande Basilica: These are really close together so I'm lumping them into 1 trip. Check out the palace, where you can sometimes see the king+queen coming and going. A couple blocks away is the basiclica, which is not the greatest ever but worth visiting for sure.
* Sol+Plaza Mayor: Two mega-touristy areas in the center of the city. Hold on to your wallet though, sketchy shit. Still, there's a ton of history there, and both are must-sees. Get some overpriced tapas in plaza mayor with friends and sit outside on the tables (weather permitting).
* Museo del Prado: Art history museum, one of the most famous in Europe. They have goya's black paintings and it the most awesome exhibit I've seen in Europe
* Museo Reina Sofia: Modern art museum. Contains works of dali, picasso


**WHERE TO GO OUT (dancing):**

* Kapital: 7-story club near Atocha station. Pretty touristy, costs 15 euros for cover and a drink, but you will end up here at some point. IMO the best of the shitty tourist clubs.
* Joy: Don't fucking go here, everyone always wants to go but it's definitely the most touristy IMO.
* The Cave: Cool club located in Moncloa. Reasonable cover and drink costs.
* Barco: WAY FUN live music bar with dancing (not really a discoteca/club) located between sol and tribunal. Cover is something like 8 euros with a drink and drink prices are average.
* Independence: Club with the best music IMO, mostly indie remixes. Relatively expensive but I'd rather blow money here than joy.


**WHERE TO GO OUT (bars):**

* La Latina: Calle de Cava Baja on La Latina has some of the best tapas bars in the city, and they're reasonably priced if you're going for drinks and not for dinner. Just walk the street from start to finish and hit every bar on the way. It might take a couple nights.
* Malasaña/Tribunal: A bit more spaced out than Cava Baja but this is a really hip/trendy area with a ton of young people and really cool bars.
* 100 Montaditos (Cien Montaditos): A chain of bars in Spain, they're everywhere. They offer jarras (beer, will explain this later) for 1 euro if you get a montadito with it (the montaditos cost ~1-2 euros, depending on what you get. On Sundays and Wednesdays, all montaditos are 1 euro. Be wary though, don't get a shit ton of food at once or else you won't want to order more and then the beer will cost 2 euros, which is pretty dumb. Grab a montadito or two for each beer per round.
* La Sureña: another chain of bars. You can get a bucket of 5 botellas (small bottles of beer) for 3 euros. They sometimes have good deals on tapas, but I wouldn't go here for dinner.

**ORDERING A BEER:**

* In Spain, 90% of the time you order beers by the size of the glass and not by the type or brand of beer.  Note that sometimes they don't give a fuck about what you ask for and just give you whatever glass you have.
* Cañas are most popular, they're little 200ml glasses of draft beer. You can get these for a euro at most inexpensive bars, and sometimes when you order a caña you'll even get a bigger glass like a tubo or a wine glass.
* Tubos are tall, thin glasses of draft beer. Usually a bit bigger than a caña and a bit more expensive
* Jarras are 750ml glasses with a handle of draft beer. This is roughly the size of a beer you would get when ordering a beer in USA. If you look around, you can sometimes find these for cheap (cien montaditos) but usually they're 3-5 euros.


**SPANISH BEERS I'VE HAD FROM WORST TO BEST:**

* Mahou (classica): Green-label mahou. It's the most common beer in Madrid, and the shittiest. I'd say it's worse than bush light but you be the judge. Saving grace is that it's unbelievably cheap. You will drink your weight in this every month, easy.
* San Miguel (especial): A really light lager with no taste. Therefore, it's better than mahou classica, but I wouldn't order it over anything else.
* Alhambra (especial): Really common in andalucia but not so much in Madrid. It's priced the same as green mahou usually and is nearly red mahou quality.
* Cruzcampo: Standard lager. I never really drink this because it's pretty forgettable but it isn't bad.
* Mahou (cinco estrellas): The red-label mahou. It's not nearly as bad as the green, and I would rank this roughly with bud light or something. It's definitely drinkable, and it has much more abv than the green one. You can find it for 1.20/half liter in a china shop, not expensive at a bar. The increase in abv alone makes it worth the price increase from green.
* San Miguel (1516): A much better variety of San Miguel. It's sort of expensive and hard to find.
* Alhambra (1925): I've only seen this in andalucia, but it's a really solid lager and isn't that expensive.
* Estrella (galicia): Really uncommon, I've only seen this twice and once was in andalucia. It's a pretty solid beer but relatively expensive. I wish I could comment on it more but I haven't had enough of it.
* Estrella (damn): The most common beer in catalonia, and my favorite session beer from spain. It isn't particularly hard to find, and costs the same as red mahou.
* La Virgen (lager): I've only found this in bottle shops and it's really expensive, but it's the best spanish lager IMO.
* La Virgen (negro): Literally THE ONLY Spanish beer I've had that wasn't a lager or shitty wheat beer so I think it wins by default.  It's a porter that I would say maybe ties Yuengling's but is way worse than Anchor's.


**IMPORTED BEERS IN SPAIN:**

* Belgian beers aren't hard to find at most grocery stores, and are the same as what we have in the US (leffe, chimay, duvel, grimbergen)
* Mexican beers are findable, and there are some restaurants. Same shit we have too (corona- called ""coronita"" in spain, pacifico, modelos, dos xs if you're lucky)
* US beers are NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE to get except bud. This info is the product of like 3 months of searching:
* (bar/restaurant) Mad Cafe in La Latina on Calle de Cava Baja has US craft brew imports (in addition to delicious burgers and wings). Brookyln brew shop, sometimes flying dog. This is just a good burger joint in general actually, go here when you miss american food.
* (bottle shop) La Pinta Buena in Mercado de San Fernando. Has a decent selection of Flying Dog, Steam, Left Hand Brewing.
* (bottle shop) La Tienda de Cerveza in La Latina: comparable to La Pinta Buena but I always end up going to La Pinta Buena for some reason.


**GETTING AROUND:**

* Walking: Don't take the metro for the first week you're there if you can help it. Walking the city is the best way to learn it, and there's a lot to see.
* Metro: This is by far the easiest way to get around. You'll learn the lines (they aren't difficult), but grab a map to use at first. Also, google maps has a public transport trip planner that works with the metro, it's the bomb. The metro closes from 1:30-6:30am, so plan accordingly on the weekends.
* Bus: Busses in madrid are pretty flaky. They don't show up on time, take foerver, and the routes are weird. Avoid the public bus unless you need to take it.  HOWEVER, intercity busses are usually the cheapest way to travel to other places in Spain, and are completely reliable.
* Cab: Cab rides in Madrid are actually really cheap, it's worth splitting one with a friend to get home on the weekend if you need to get back early or something.


**GETTING AROUND (cost options):**

* There are three zone- A, B1, and B2. A is the inner-city, B1 is the immediate suburbs, and B2 is way the fuck out. Traveling within A is really cheap (1.20) but to go from A to B1 is 2 euros, and that shit adds up if you're using it to go to school. I've never had to travel to B2 so I don't know how much it costs for 1 trip. Luckily there are some options.
* 30-day pass: This is your most cost-efficient option if you're taking transport every day. You have to find out if your school is in zone B1 or B2 and pick your pass accordingly. You have to go to a state tobacco shop to get one of these (called ""tobaccos"", they're on most street corners). You can get the one for people under 23 years old, but you have to give them your address and it takes 2 weeks for them to mail it to you. Here is a list of zones and prices: http://www.metromadrid.es/es/viaja_en_metro/tarifas/abonos/index.html
* 10-trip pass: 12.50 euros. This is what I use to get around in the city. However, if I would do it again, I would get the joven pass I think. You end up using the metro a shitload. 


**Renting a Piso (Apartment)**

* The location you want is going to depend on where your school is, but as a general rule of thumb, live near a metro station if you can.
* You will likely be renting a habitacion (room) in a shared flat/apartment (piso).  Make sure you meet your compis de piso (flatmates) and you can get along well with them.  I would offer to buy them a beer after viewing the place, it's a good way to find out more about the apartment and you're potential future flatmates.
* When checking out a piso, make sure you notice the little things: Is there an oven?  Is there a washing machine?  A/C? Do you get cell phone reception?  How noisy is the place?  etc.
* Book a hostel for a week before you arrive, that way you'll have a place to stay while you search for a piso.  Have a couple pisos picked out to visit before you go, but don't sign on anything until you see it.  I stayed at Way Hostel near Sol, which was crazy fun, but you won't get much sleep staying there.  There are multiple websites such as Tripadvisor that rate hostels for you, I would check them out, read some reviews, and pick one you think you would like.  It wouldn't be a bad idea to get a hostel in the area you want to live.
* It's pretty common to have a shitty contract, and it's not impossible to have no contract at all (depending on who you're renting from).  I lucked out and have THE NICEST LANDLADY IN THE WORLD, but be careful who you're renting from.  Also, if you're looking for a piso in Moncloa/Arguelles, my room will be open after January 9th, so PM me if you'd like to come check it out.
* In my opinion, the best barrios to live in are La Latina, Moncloa/Arguelles, Tribunal, and Novaciando.  Don't live right in or around Sol if you can help it, it's a giant tourist trap and it's way crowded and noisy.  Unless that's what you're into.
* I found my place through [idealista](http://www.idealista.com/), but it was a huge pain in the ass.  Most of my friends used [Aluni](http://www.idealista.com/) or [EasyPiso](http://www.idealista.com/)",0,1356346098,null,0,1356349199,0,c7lg12w,t3_15ceqw,t1_c7lg12w,t3_15ceqw,null,1430758848,10,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,10

A simplistic chart from a notoriously biased website is not a set of ""facts"" if the methods used to create the chart are kept secret. 

&gt;Er, you may want to read up on some history.

Cool, then give me a previous example where the President of the US issued a death warrant for a citizen and his child. Hint: you won't find one because this is unprecedented.

&gt;How is this the US attacking their own populace?

You don't think extrajudicial murder counts as an attack? 

&gt;If you want some place to live which is free from any sort of government intrusion then your choice is only Somalia.

And if you want to live in a place where the government will keep you safe your only choice is North Korea. What a fun game this is.

&gt;IIRC the figure for just innocent people being shot in something they weren't involved in was 1100~. Even if only this is taken in to account (and the other 10k+ gun homicides are ignored) the US' rate is still higher than other developed countries.

Yet still not anything close to ""often"", given the number of guns and incidence of ownership.

&gt;Nice bullshit strawman and projection.

Yes you have. If you're going to dismiss any real-world evidence that's harmful to your case then I will do the same to yours.

&gt;You claim that these examples are examples of ""failure"" of gun control. The logical inference is that you think it claims to stop all crime, which is an asinine assumption on your part.

Again, stop trying to claim I said something I didn't. It's childish. If you wish to intentionally misinterpret what I say that's your business. But lying isn't an effective strategy on the internet.

&gt;Good job on directly contradicting yourself. Above this paragraph you denied that you considered these examples to be failures of gun control.

No I didn't. Christ, learn to read. Or how to not lie.
