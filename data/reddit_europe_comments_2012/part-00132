No its not irrelevant, seeing as those are the source countries of the immigrants. Unless you suggest that the neural network of an immigrant from there gets magically reformed to leave those ideas behind by the act of crossing the border, I dont see your point.

Besides, there are also statistics that show similarly unacceptably high support for barbaric ideas among the immigrants. For example:
&gt;36% of 16-24 year olds believe if a Muslim converts to another religion they should be punished by death, compared to 19% of 55+ year old Muslims, 13% of 16-24 year olds admire organisations like Al-Qaeda compared to 3% of 55+ year olds. 61% of the questioned agree that homosexuality should be illegal, and 31 % agree that Muslim conversion should be forbidden and punishable by death.

I hear that irony theory pretty often (it is applied to all kinds of racist apologist rhetoric, and was very popular in the US after the civil war in relation to the migration of the freed black slaves to the north) and it implies that the people who criticize antiziganism have never been confronted with **The Gypsy**. The minute those non-discriminating people meet **The Gypsy** they immediately change their minds because get to know **The Truth**.

So that's why I wrote the comment. Take it anyway you want it but I didn't say precisely you are discriminating. But thanks for the ""I'm not racist, I have black friends"" type reply. It's only second to ""I'm not racist but ^*insert ^vile ^racism ^here*"".

On the issue of giving them ""opportunities"". It is only partially true. In fact very little of it is true. It's a blatant lie actually. What if I told you that those extreme cases where Romanis (who have for generations lived a nomadic life and were then tucked into some housing in remote parts of the country) destroyed their opportunities are actually exceptions? Have you ever thought it's not all of them? And that you probably never see the good examples because they never make it into the media? Ôr because integrated Romani are actually ashamed of their non-integrated ethnic group compatriots?! No, no.. it's clearly ALL OF THEM. Let's first remember that the *merciful Gods* that gave them those opportunities were also the same kind people that developed unhuman assimilation strategies which included kind [opportunities](http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/August/200608171045451CJsamohT0.678158.html) like [sterilization](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6409699.stm).

&gt; Of course, if the not working ones got less money from the state, they would call us racists, yet they are not willing to do honest work, because they don't have to. It's an endless circle.

My family successfully employs Romani people. It wasn't easy. Took some time of unlearning bad habits but actually works pretty great. Especially for my dad who has less costs (wink, wink). The hardest are the young men but it's more because of their drug/alcohol habits. The Romani themselves see that as a huge problem but cannot help themselves. The clan mum came personally to me to give me her ""white magic"" (lol) because because of my father's giving them jobs and talking with them in ""good strict plain text"" I quote ""the kids aren't eating their shoes anymore"". They even created their own construction firm (with the help of my dad) and are now employing other Romani. They started repairing old houses of poor ethnic ""white people"". Unexpectedly works for everybody, really.

I promise you. The second you try to actually work with them, it works out better than all those empty stereotypes. Well, they still remain Romani... and that's not always nice to deal with.. but it's the same thing with everybody.

It's not even about whether it actually does affect his duties - it's whether the public are likely to perceive it.

Hence the term 'blind justice' - hence why Lady Justice is always shown blindfolded.
 
Anyway in answer to your question - if people perceive the officer to be showing a political allegiance, it may put them off approaching him or dealing with him fully and that will affect his duties.

It's as simple as that.

And it's not just a case of me being arrogant - you yourself can go through the comment history and see where you've ignored very good points from people, been downvoted, and made ridiculously obtuse 'questions' designed to illicit the response that you want, when the answer is very clear and obvious.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Nope. A civil war requires (at least) two strongly supported factions with coherent but conflicting intended policies and a willingness to resort to violence to see them implemented. I don't see that in the current makeup of Greek society.

Golden Dawn is the only faction that I can see wanting to resort to violence, but let's be serious. 90% of them are neighborhood wannabe tough guys who will scatter when they encounter serious resistance. A police operation could disband them in a couple of days. That would be, if there was any political will to do so. The only reason they've been left alone to play nazi kids is because they offer the current gov a useful diversion from all the economic doom and gloom. 

The ""Radical Left"" isn't that radical. Syriza started moving towards the political center once they realised they actually have a real shot at the government. If they actually manage to win they will have to form a coalition to gain a parliamentary majority. The parties that are to the left of Syriza on the political spectrum are not really open to that (a possible exception is Antarsia, a party that got less than half percent in the previous elections in June). The resulting coalition would be diluted with many social democratic MPs. I think the result would be only a little further to the left than mainstream european socialist parties. Not really the kind of people you would expect on the frontlines.

Now, regading the military. Yes, it is the most ""respected"" institution. Do you know why that is? It's because it really doesn't do all that much.   Greece still has a mandatory national service period (aka conscription) of 9 months for every adult male citizen. Practically everyone has already seen first hand (or has a close realtive that has seen first hand) the military form the inside. Frankly, except for the special forces and some first line sections like air force pilots and naval crews, the military is mostly public sector busywork with uniforms. Most of the current officer corps is made up of educated lower middle class guys looking for a steady job. Also,let me remind you that there actually was a period of military rule in Greece's modern history (1967-1974) which was widely considered to be a disaster and has discredited the concept of the army as a political force in the minds of the younger generations.

Sweden in  general, and Malmö in particular have had a lot of immigrants from the Middle East and Africa during the last 20 years, most of them Muslims. They are, compared to the rest of the population and other immigrants, badly integrated, live on welfare, commit more crimes etc.

Swedish politicians haven't dealt with this at all, talking about it brands you a racist don't put any demands on the poor immigrants etc, so, naturally we now have a party that (immigrant wise, not on all other things) is very right, want to throw out the immigrants etc. That pattern might not be so different from a lot of other countries.

In Malmö they combine this, somehow with a lot of Muslim immigrants living on welfare, with inept politicians who doesn't really do anything.The Jews in Malmö have been attacked several times, and when they complained, the ""strong man"" in Malmö, Reepalu, suggested that perhaps *Israel* should change its tactic, implying that is was their fault. Completely ignoring the fact that they are not Israeli and that we have freedom of religion. 

Reepalu (mayor) is a complete idiot, and was forced by his party (the social democrats) to retract his statement, but he is not a Nazi. 

Basically, they are just saying, everytime somethings happens ""Ooops"". The Malmö politicians (Reepalu et al) refuse to see the pattern, and they refuse to actually call out those parts of the Muslim community who commit these crimes.

true,Meneth,NORW,Norway,"&gt; Congratulations on cherry-picking which statements in my post you responded to, hoping that it would make you appear intelligent.

Considering you dismissed my link entirely, I don't see how you have any right to complain about 'cherry-picking'.

I addressed the points I found most important, but I'll address your posts paragraph by paragraph if you prefer that:

&gt; You don't have any evidence at all, whereas I have experience. I'll take my experience over your lack of both evidence and experience any day of the week.

I linked a study that clearly shows the placebo effect can have the effects you say acupuncture has had on you (stopping the suffering of debilitating pain)

&gt; I'm familiar with the placebo effect, but that only works on those who go into the procedure not knowing about said procedure. They've been given the impression that it works beforehand.. whereas I researched many different methods of pain relief and only after the research did I decide to try accupuncture. The reason I reacted as strongly as I did is that your comment was sudden, not backed up by ANY evidence whatsoever.

The placebo effect works regardless. To reference the video I linked again: The effect persisted even after the patients were told their surgery was merely a placebo.

More anecdotally, the placebo effect causes painkillers to have immediate effect for me, despite me well knowing that it takes a while for the body to actually absorb the drug.

&gt;While evidence exists that the placebo effect is real, what evidence do you have that it's effecting ME?

&gt;Also, one link to one scientific study does not disprove an entire field. It's a good start, but you have a LOT more proof to get before you effectively disprove something that relieves a large amount of pain for me.

While a single study of course doesn't disprove acupuncture on its own, it does quite clearly show that your experience could merely be placebo. Your anecdotal evidence is not good evidence of acupuncture's efficacy.

&gt; You may not think it's real.. but it sure FEELS real to me. Accupuncture allows me to go about my day in less pain than I would otherwise.

I'm sure practitioners of any other alternative medicine would tell me the exact same thing, as would the placebo group in the study I linked before they were told they received a placebo surgery rather than real surgery.

&gt; Sorry to say, you failed.
Address the entire post, otherwise you're no better than a troll.
Also, one piece of ""evidence"" is not enough to disprove ANYTHING. Where is the rest of your evidence?
What that? Oh, you don't have any? That's what I thought

As this is a non-argument, I'll refrain from responding to it.

&gt; You can keep believing whatever you want. Unless you are willing and able to prove your point through conclusive science, all you're doing is flapping your gums.

I'm an Arab Muslim who studied in Europe and is currently back home in the Middle East, and I am just as opposed to radicalism and backwardness as most Europeans are. That applies to both Muslim radicals and radical, racist xenophobes such as yourself. What you are doing here is lumping me, and millions upon millions of decent people with those who espouse the values that you are so against. 

You continually refer to us as ""savages"" simply because we are Muslim, and you have made your mind up about what that implies about us as persons. Truth is that you don't know the first thing about what I and millions of Muslims - whether in Europe or elsewhere - actually think. 

When you dehumanise the other, reduce them in your mind to nothing more than ""savages"" - and presume to know what is in their heads and hearts - you are just as bad as the very people you so strongly criticise.

It is quite frankly frightening to see the dangerous increase in the very type of thinking that led to the murder of millions of Jews in Europe in the 1940s. If you go back and read the bigoted garbage that many Europeans were saying about Jews back then, you will find that they sounded very much like you sound today.  

I don't even feel angry anymore at seeing this garbage continually spewed and upvoted on this website. I feel sad more than anything, because what drew me to Europe in the first place was the respect I had for its tolerance, open mindedness and progressive thinking.

&gt;Witness Moshe Dyan Kaplan’s claim to be a Pharisee and his contempt for the Jews who were gassed, Cheesies he called them .. Kaplan was a RAAF bomber pilot in WW2 who had flown in the 1945 air raid on Dresden, who says his Amsterdam family emerged unscathed.

&gt;After the war he flew Lockheed Electra’s for KLM in Holland and for Lufthansa .. he was the son of a well established Jewish family with antecedents in Johannesburg South Africa, in Amsterdam and in Western Australia, later he was a pilot in New Guinea and dabbled in pawnbroking.

&gt;He was the image of the actor who played [Emmanuel Goldstein](http://i6.minus.com/jcrxI6.jpg), in Michael Radford’s 1984 movie 1984, starring John Hurt and Richard Burton, when I asked him how Radford obtained the footage, and under what circumstances it had been shot, he remained unforthcoming and seemed amused!

**After the war he returned to Amsterdam .. I said it must have been heart rending to go back to empty rooms and deserted halls, since Hitler’s men had their way!**

&gt;He said it was good, I said sure but what about all his friends and rellies, he said they were fine, I said that they could not have been fine, since Hitler had the whole lot rounded up and sent to Auschwitz. 

&gt;Indeed The [Diary of Anne Frank](http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v03/v03p147_Faurisson.html), a tale of oppression of Jews by the Nazi’s was set in Amsterdam, as well Stanley Kramer’s great movie [Ship of Fools](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bCCAYRTd92U/T_hTB5rNOCI/AAAAAAAACTE/EkdlxP5uVbM/s1600/vlcsnap-2012-07-04-20h49m23s59.png), based on the true story of Jews fleeing the Nazi’s, had its culmination in that city where the ship finally docked.

&gt;After having been turned away from Havana Cuba and from New York, the passengers themselves speedily transported to Auschwitz gas and death .. Moshe nodded sagely, he told me he was indeed a Pharisee..

&gt;That the Jews of Amsterdam as depicted in The Diary of Anne Frank, were certainly Jews however were not in the same category as him.. they were he told me called Cheesies, since their diet consisted largely of that product.

**That they were missing from the community was because they had indeed been gassed, he gave me to understand that as far as he was concerned, they were neither missed nor mourned.**

&gt;And to clean up any racial minority or dissident group who were perceived as a threat, or were seen as capable of becoming a threat at some time in the future, so the commos, pamphleteers, whacko’s, crazies and the lunatic fringe, were all bundled in with the Cheesies, Gypsies, Russians and Poles, and in Hitler’s words exterminated.

&gt;After each phase of dirty work proceeded in a master plan devised by the Pharisees, the thugs had carried out the dirty deeds were themselves murdered, [Ernst Rohm](http://zaprasza.net/znf/0.Ernst%20R%C3%B6hm.JPG?article_id=31908) leader of the thug SA movement, murdered with numerous of his thug mates, in the in June 1934 [Night of the Long Knives](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/The-Night-Of-The-Long-Knives-ADOLPH-HITLER-Hermann-Goering-NAZIS-1934-Newspaper-/00/s/NTEyWDY0MA==/$%28KGrHqJ,!rIFBPSRPY,LBQYDwbz+cQ~~60_35.JPG) Massacre.

Was ist den nochmal das Problem mit den männlichen Worten bzw. der entpsrechenden Grammatik?

Als jemand der nicht aus dem deutschen Sprachraum kommt, wirkt die ganze Diskussion auf mich irgendwie wie ein 1st world Problem. Etwas was eigentlich keinen Schaden anrichtet. Klar klingt das auch komisch wenn man es verweiblicht aber das macht es jetzt nicht wirklich falsch oder böse. Das sogar teilweise extrem komisch wirken wenn man das Beispiel mit der (zu meiner Zeit) unterbundenen Verweiblichung von Rängen in der Bundeswehr ansieht. Bei Frau Gefreite wäre ja noch gegangen. Bei Frau Stabsunteroffi(ziöse/zierin??) wird es aber richtig affig. Die Ränge jetzt auf eine 3. Art umzuformen würde es nicht besser sondern schlechter machen weil man nicht einmal die gut klingende männliche Form hätte. Jedenfalls in meinen Augen.

Ich weiss nicht ob man den betroffenen Gruppen (Piraten, Sprachwissenschaftlern, Feministinen) einen Gefallen tut wenn man versucht etwas einzuführen was für alle komisch klingt nur um eines Zweckes willen den sich diese Gruppe erst ausgedacht hat. So sieht es für meine Augen auch aus. Es sieht so aus als hätte diese Interessensgemeinschaft eine Realität geschaffen in der diese Worte ein Problem darstellen welches man genauso ändern muss wie den Gebrauch von Nigger. 

Das was der Autor gemacht hat (und da er ein Sprachkundiger ist, wahrscheinlich auch mit Absicht) war auch heftigst zu mixen. Es kam die tatsächlich historisch fassbare Diskriminierung durch Worte vor (Neger, Homo, etc.). Es kamen die Märchen der Kinder vor die zu wenige weibliche Hauptdarsteller haben. Sachen die mit dem obigen eher wenig gemein haben. Da liegen doch Welten zwischen Neger und Pirat. Es gibt gute, für alle heute nachvollziehbare Gründe warum man nicht Neger sagen sollte. Er hat das ja mit der Oma sogar als Beispiel angeführt. Bei dem Piraten scheint mir jedoch, daß er absichtlich dramatisiert oder sich dumm stellt. 

Ich weiss nicht. Kann das im Nachhinein nicht mehr wirklich ernst nehmen. Ich denke auch, daß die Feministinen sich keinen Gefallen damit tun Energie und Zeit in so einen Quatsch zu investieren.

Some Muslim immigrants admit their bias quite openly. An Islamic Mufti in Copenhagen sparked a political outcry after publicly declaring that women who refuse to wear headscarves are ""asking for rape."" Apparently, he's not the only one thinking this way. “It is not as wrong raping a Swedish girl as raping an Arab girl,” says Hamid. “The Swedish girl gets a lot of help afterwards, and she had probably fucked before, anyway. But the Arab girl will get problems with her family. For her, being raped is a source of shame. It is important that she retains her virginity until she marries.” It was no coincidence that it was a Swedish girl that was gang raped in Rissne – this becomes obvious from the discussion with Ali, Hamid, Abdallah and Richard. All four have disparaging views on Swedish girls, and think this attitude is common among young men with immigrant background. “It is far too easy to get a Swedish whore…… girl, I mean;” says Hamid, and laughs over his own choice of words. “Many immigrant boys have Swedish girlfriends when they are teenagers. But when they get married, they get a proper woman from their own culture who has never been with a boy. That’s what I am going to do. I don’t have too much respect for Swedish girls. I guess you can say they get fucked to pieces.

""The Whore Lived Like a German""

In the past four months, six Muslim women living in Berlin have been brutally murdered by family members. Their crime? Trying to break free and live Western lifestyles. Within their communities, the killers are revered as heroes for preserving their family dignity. How can such a horrific and shockingly archaic practice be flourishing in the heart of Europe? The deaths have sparked momentary outrage, but will they change the grim reality for Muslim women?

Like german neonazis. But everybody _can_ openly criticize German Nazis, we can make fun of them, we can call their ideology shit, we can oppress them, we can openly say that we do not want their shit ideology to spread.

But we cant openly criticize Muslim Nazis because they are Muslims. They disguised their nazism as a religion, and because of various laws for religious tolerance, we are not allowed to criticize religion directly. They abuse the religion as a protection shield, because every time you criticize them, you also simulteneously criticize all the moderate Muslims too, who happen to share the same religion.

When you call Muslim Nazi's ideology shit, like we can and *do* call German Nazi ideology shit, suddenly _all_ Muslims rise and protest because you insulted their prophet. They share the exactly same ideology, they only adhere to it to a different degree. And instead of very clearly distancing themselves from the fundamentalists, the moderates help protecting the underlying nazi ideology (Islam) from criticism.

It would be like having all Germans regarding ""Mein Kampf"" as a holy book, but only a few black sheep being fundamentalists.

I dont know how representative this poll is, but if it is, it is something to think about when making long-term decisions about how many Muslims terra-formers (also accounting to their higher birth-rates) we want to have in Europe in the long term. Half of them will work on transforming Europe to Islamistan.

We've already seen this here in Germany during the circumcision debate and the Muhammad movie debate. Suddenly, you see Muslims pushing their religious shit into german laws. Genital mutilation of children, which most Germans oppose and which is illegal under the current law, suddenly has to be legalized because Muslims ""need"" it. Making fun of Muhammad in carricatures and movies is legal and not something Germans oppose, but it suddenly is on the verge of becoming illegal because it is ""insulting"" to Muslims, etc. There are ""only"" about 5% Muslims in Germany, but you _already_ have them (successfully) pushing Islam heavily into laws affecting everybody else.

Je lis l'article et tombe, entre autres, là-dessus :
""Des racistes, comme partout, il en existe au Front national. «Ils appartiennent à la vieille génération, celle de Jean-Marie Le Pen», veut-elle croire.""

C'est au sujet d'une jeune femme dont les parents sont immigrés de Tunisie (je n'aime pas l'expression ""d'origine tunisienne""... comme si, lorsqu'on était Français, on devrait avoir ""des origines"", berk).

Le ""veut-elle croire"" est particulièrement vicelard. Cela sous-entend automatiquement, du point de vue du journaliste (sur quelles bases ? Avec quelle source ?) que les adhérents du FN sont nécessairement racistes.

L'article est bourré de ce genre de choses. On est en plein dans la propagande molle et triste d'une gauche qui n'a plus rien à vendre sauf une opposition avec la droite et l'extrême-droite.

Taper sur le Front National et mépriser ses électeurs, ça mange pas de pain et ça ne demande quasiment aucune réflexion.

Quant à cet article de Marianne, il ne pose réellement aucune question. Il interroge et juge dans la foulée, avec un parti pris hallucinant. C'est vraiment du mépris ouvert pour des gens-qui-votent-mal. On est très loin d'un travail de journaliste documenté et désirant se monter objectif. Non : on est face à un journaliste qui va voir des égarés pour leur demander pourquoi ils votent comme des cons. Et lorsque cela ne correspond pas à sa réalité (la fille d'immigrés qui adhère aux idées FN), ils tournent tout de même leurs propres commentaires pour faire comme si elle était totalement aliénée.

La haine de l'autre, tu la trouves partout si tu as envie de la trouver, hein. Au PS, lorsque Hollande sortait ""je n'aime pas les riches"", alors qu'il avait un bon million de patrimoine, je trouvais ça aussi violent. Lorsque Sarkozy parlait de racailles ou insultait un quidam qui avait refusé de lui serrer la main, lorsqu'il bafouait les règles de la République en empêchant des gens de s'exprimer avant ses déplacements (flics qui passaient pour retirer des sigles, drapeaux, pancartes, affiches), je trouvais ça tout aussi violent.

On en arrive au stade où c'est limite le FN qui peut donner des leçons d'antiracisme à l'UMP (voir les remarques mémorables de MLP à NKM lors de leur fameux débat sur le sujet), et où le PS a bâti une partie de son programme sur une accusation directe de ""riches"".

Si tu veux voir de ce côté, regarde tous les reportages, articles, etc. dédiés au Front National. Avant même qu'un militant n'ouvre la bouche, on parle de suite des conditions socioéconomiques des votants. Ce sont nécessairement des âmes perdues, des gens égarés, des laissés-pour-compte, etc.

Ce qui est drôle, d'ailleurs, c'est lorsqu'on dit que le FN est le ""premier parti ouvrier de France"", en justification.

Alors que non : il faut nuancer. 

Le FN récolte une majorité de ses voix dans les ""plus basses classes sociales"", c'est vrai. Mais c'est le Parti Socialiste qui capte le plus les voix des ouvriers. La nuance statistique est très, très, très importante. Le Parti Socialiste reste un parti charmant les classes populaires.

Le truc fun, donc, c'est que dans le premier cas, c'est parce que les gens ont peur, se sentent délaissés, etc. Dans le second, c'est parce qu'ils y voient de l'espoir.

Justification ? Aucune. Les médias. Tout est fait pour qu'on voit avant tout le FN comme un véritable parti de frustrés, avec un vote peu valorisant. 

Mais putain, on peut les prendre pour des êtres humains comme nous, ces gens ! Merde...! 

A se demander aussi : si des gens votent pour un parti en pensant qu'il peut régler ses problèmes, cela disqualifie le vote ? Si des gens ont peur et votent pour un parti, c'est bien par espoir, non ? On peut tourner ce genre de remarques n'importe comment.

They said pretty much stupid stuff. For example when the Bank Northern Rock was the first UK bank in more than 100 years to have a run on the bank. The government nationalised it since it wasn't functioning anymore. The guy in charge of our economy at that time said it was a bad idea and the market should deal with it. This is at the time Lehman Bros collapsed and the stockmarkets were dropping by hundreds of points. No one was buying any bank shares unless it was to short sell it.

They got away with most of the stuff but the referrendum was is the ablatross on their neck. This dates back to when the new EU treaty was going to be signed. They put Pressure on PM Brown not to sign it without a referendum. PM Brown signed it but got some redlines for the UK. They spent the year hounding him for not having a referendum. When it was their turn to be the government they very quickly said it was going to happen at the end of their term around 2014/15. Until then their plan was not to hand the EU any more power from the UK. They hoped that would please the crowd  while quitely killing thereferendum. 

It didn't work and it flares up often. The Euroskeptics remember and they feel betrayed. They spent so much time when they were in opposition fanning the flames of Euroskepticsm that they now have to deal with it. The Labour party can easily ignore the Euroskeptics because most of them never vote for Labour, but for the Tories it was a double edged sword and now it's leaning in their direction. The majority of the country hates the Conservative party or don't even trust them. Their real core support is in Southern England among communities that are likely to be Euroskeptic.

Je dirais que cette radicalisation des propos du PS/UMP n'est que relativement récente dans l'Histoire de la Ve République. Je pense que Sarkozy et son gouvernement ont plus ou moins délibérément tenu des propos scandaleux pour continuer à piocher dans les voix des électeurs FN.

Historiquement, le FN est un parti violent qui prend ses racines dans la haine de l'autre (il suffit de lire les exploits de JMLP en Algérie et plus tard dans sa longue et prolifique carrière politique). Et même si aujourd'hui, le parti peut se targuer de ne pas avoir de propos plus violent qu'un autre, c'est son Histoire et ce qu'il représente qui me dérangent à titre personnel. Jamais le PS/l'UMP n'est aller fricotter avec une milice de skins en tant que ""service d'ordre"" par exemple, jamais d'autre parti ne s'est vanté d'avoir tenu des propos négationnistes devant la presse (je n'ai plus les citations exactes en tête mais je me souviens d'un récent: ""l'occupation allemande n'était pas si inhumaine""), jamais d'autre parti (MNR exclu) français n'a ouvertement mis en avant l'idée de superiorité de ""la race blanche"" (cf propos récemment réitérés durant l'université d'été du FN), c'est CA qui me pose problème avec ce parti et qui me pousse (et nombre d'autres français) à me demander ce qui conduit une partie de nous à voter pour le FN.

Est ce que Marine a définitivement tourné la page de cette Histoire sulfureuse?

However, in the last 20 years there has been somewhat of a Cultural resurgence of the Catalan. This has been a result of the integration of Spain in the Schengen treaty. People in Northen Catalonia have been willing to resume economic and Cultural relations with Southern Catalonia as they did until the [18th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_the_Pyrenees). It has to be considered, for example that Barcelona is closer than Touluse or Paris, so many young people consider going there to study.

The maximum exponent of this cultural resurgence has been the succes of the [Bressola Schools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Bressola), a network of comunity schools that introduce the Catalan language in their curriculum.

Politicaly however, there is no strong nationalist movement, and no desiere to split up from France.

Ah ouais, et on pose évidemment la question aux milices d'extrême-gauche, également ? Heureusement que les partis ""centraux"" n'utilisent pas de services de protections privés : 1. ils ne gênent généralement personne, 2. ils ont le soutien des autorités au moindre souci.

Ce que tu condamnes à l'extrême-droite, tu l'as eu et tu l'as encore à l'extrême-gauche, hein. Tu l'as en fait au sein de tout groupe minoritaire qui peut être directement menacé physiquement (ce qui n'est quasiment jamais le cas de tous ceux adoptant une posture centrale, consensuelle, et bien intégrée dans un système qui les accepte à 100%).

Pour l'occupation allemande ""pas si inhumaine"" : bon, le type l'a vécu. Pour avoir voyagé dans les pays de l'Est, et entendu parler d'anciens résistants et des ""vieux"" de l'occupation, si c'est *uniquement* cette phrase qui a choqué, je suis d'accord. L'occupation a été atroce pour des minorités (Juifs, par exemple), mais le Français moyen a surtout été soumis à une économie de guerre et risquait peu de choses. La collaboration restait tout de même assez massive...

Ouvre un livre d'histoire et compare avec l'occupation dans d'autres pays. La Pologne, par exemple. Le projet était simple : épuration systématique, en commençant par les Juifs. La France n'a pas connu ça. Jean-Marie Le Pen ne s'est justement pas compromis en affirmant quelque chose de tel, alors qu'il s'est déjà activement battu (dans son idéologie, et ce qui est contestable) ""pour la France"".

A noter, et ça va te faire rire, que si la SFIO a majoritairement collaboré, De Gaulle s'est par la suite trouvé sur-entouré de Juifs (normal) et de nationalistes (certains antisémites). C'est logique, hein, pas besoin d'être étonné : le même genre de gus qui remplissent les rangs du Front National, qui ont pu faire l'Algérie, etc. n'appréciaient pas du tout de voir leur pays envahi. Le patriotisme et le nationalisme, ça reste tout de même une tendance à voir d'un mauvais œil toute forme d'attaque contre son pays.
Voir ce genre de choses : http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_%28r%C3%A9seau%29
http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un_paradoxe_fran%C3%A7ais

C'était une sale époque, hein. Tiens, d'ailleurs, vu que le Professeur Choron s'est engagé activement pour l'Indochine, tu condamnes l'existence même de Charlie Hebdo ? Bien sûr que non. On en est pas là. Idem pour toute la filiation entre la SFIO, Mitterrand et le PS actuel.

&gt;jamais d'autre parti (MNR exclu) français n'a ouvertement mis en avant l'idée de superiorité de ""la race blanche"" (cf propos récemment réitérés durant l'université d'été du FN),

Ils n'ont pas parlé de supériorité de la race blanche. JMLP a défini, comme le font la plupart du temps les nationalistes, son ""peuple"". Ah, tu sais qui il a cité, pour cela ? Lorsque le terme ""race"" a été prononcé, c'était en référence à une citation de... *De Gaulle*. Aïe.
http://www.20minutes.fr/politique/1008523-jean-marie-pen-enchaine-provocations-immigration

Quant aux questions sur le ""peuple français"" (quel que soit la signification de ce truc... bah, je n'y crois pas), c'est normal que des nationalistes se la posent. C'est un peu comme si des gens s'étonnaient que des gens d'extrême-gauche se posent la question de la lutte des classes (qui consiste tout de même à essentialiser par la position socio-économique et des conditions matérielles -possession de capitaux, par exemple- le comportement d'individus... ben ouais, d'un côté comme de l'autre, on essentialise, on généralise, et on oublie les individus).

J'étais récemment dans un pays à forte majorité musulmane, et ai vu les manifs devant le Consulat Français. C'est pas des blagues. Ils ne plaisantent véritablement pas avec leur Mahomet, hein (ils y tiennent, putain !). Ça ressemblait plus à une manif de milice fasciste (marche au pas, slogans bien récités en gueulant) qu'à une gentille manif comme on en connaît avec des étudiants ou des infirmiers en France.

Je comprendrais presque que des laïques purs et durs se rattachent par exemple avec le Front National parce qu'ils se rendent compte que les Islamistes et une partie des Musulmans ne croient pas en une seule seconde à une acceptation d'anciennes caractéristiques de l'idéologie républicaine (laïcité, absence de condamnation du blasphème, liberté d'expression quasi-totale...). Lorsque tu vois comment certains pans de la population réagissent à un pauvre film et à des dessins mal foutus, tu fais éventuellement le lien avec la situation de ton propre pays.

Pendant un moment, j'ai compris pourquoi des nationalistes, des laïcs et des ""extrémistes"" flippaient. Lorsque tu vois le déballage de haine profonde, essentialisante elle aussi, dont font preuve ces fous furieux, ça fait peur. Perso, je prends pas position ; je me sens pas plus proche d'une ""culture française"" que d'une autre.

Pour ceux que ça intéresse, France 3 (mainstream, arrgh) a diffusé un reportage (au titre évocateur qui risque de déplaire à beaucoup apparemment) l'année passée sur le sujet. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZGP_bSGFoQ)[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZGP_bSGFoQ]

En ce qui concerne la citation attribuée à De Gaulle, il faut quand même voir le contexte dans laquelle cette phrase a initialement été prononcée puis ensuite reprise par Le Pen. Primo: l'origine de cette citation n'a jamais vraiment été vérifiée, secundo: celle-ci aurait été prononcée pendant la guerre d'Algérie donc un contexte radicalement différent.

Then you should look at our neighbouring countries like Norway. Their government recently made a deal of open deportation of Somalis with the Somali government.

&gt;As for the bullshit you're spewing about Belgium, just shut the fuck up already.

I think the rest of us will be laughing when your country fractures into three pieces. Brussels is obviously the next to go Luxembourg.

&gt;Your monocultural ""nation"" is an invention that's not even 200 years old. 

Our monocultural nation is roughly 800 years old, 489 if counting the little tiff with Denmark. It's always cute seeing globalists tout the party line.

&gt;Immigration has always been a very large part of European history. 

Not really, very few nations were of the Netherlands ""let's invite everyone"" sort. We had a few very strict intake of a couple of hundred workers under Kings, but beyond that ""immigration"" for us meant one Swede living in another city up until around 1970. 

&gt;Forgot how we sent everybody overseas, by the way? 

Emigration you mean. Most of which came about due to starvation.

&gt;Human history is one big motherfucking migration. Do you think Swedes sprang out of the ground in Scandinavia? Holy shit.

Swedes sprang out of the Corded Ware culture that settled in Scandinavia post-Ice thaw. (arguably Bromme-Lyngby, but that's more argued) 

The first mention of our people as Swedes is found in Roman sources by the by. 

&gt;As for the EU and Europe and not collapsing, you didn't understand a word I said.

I know full well you think only backsliding nations could resort to it, I retorded on the grounds that only the EU is actually for it. 

&gt;Besides, somebody who thinks Belgium can't be representative for Europe, but his white Scandinavian ass is, what a motherfucking joke. 

Belgians can't, which is why you got the EU presidency. No one to identify with and a fractured nation ready to separate is obviously perfect for anti-nationalism.  

&gt;Get the fuck out of here. You're about as representative for Europe as Saint Paul, Minnesota is for the USA.

The Midwest basically is the American baseline, yes.

&gt;You and your fascist little friends are going to have to learn that your monocultural dream is dying every day, a little bit more. :)

Don't worry, i'm sure we'll do just fine. After all, multicultists are already dying off in droves ideologically here and in neighbouring countries.

&gt;En ce qui concerne la citation attribuée à De Gaulle, il faut quand même voir le contexte dans laquelle cette phrase a initialement été prononcée puis ensuite reprise par Le Pen. Primo: l'origine de cette citation n'a jamais vraiment été vérifiée, secundo: celle-ci aurait été prononcée pendant la guerre d'Algérie donc un contexte radicalement différent. De Gaulle en 59 était déjà sur la sellette, les mentalitées changeaient et De Gaulle restaient sur ses convictions datant du début du siècle ... Le Pen a repris cette citation en 2012.

Donc on sort du contexte lorsqu'il s'agit de JMLP lors de la Guerre d'Algérie, mais on remet dans son contexte lorsque c'est De Gaulle, qui se faisait tout de même traiter de fasciste dans les années 60 ? Ah.

&gt;C'est aussi bien de se poser des questions sur l'Histoire du FN et des autres partis politique français, mais je ne peux juste pas comprendre comment on peut être dans un déni pareil de la violence associée à ce parti comparé au reste du paysage politique (note que je ne parle pas des autres partis extrémistes!).

Peut-être parce qu'historiquement, tous les partis politiques ou hommes politiques ont quasiment tous opéré de façon plus ou moins sombre ? Je t'ai donné plusieurs exemples avérés, et t'ai rappelé que là où des partis extrémistes doivent compter sur des forces privées (milices, groupes de défense, etc. de gauche ou de droite, hein !), les partis ""de gouvernement"" peuvent compter sur les forces publiques (services secrets, police et gendarmerie, gardes du corps payés par l'Etat, etc). Lorsque des gens se font bousculer, arrêter, malmener physiquement (je cherchais justement la dépêche, datant d'il y a quelques années, d'un pauvre type qui s'était fait péter la main par les gardes du corps de Sarkozy mais ne le retrouve plus...) par des gardes du corps ""officiels"", on en parle moins.

Pour la fin, et les deux derniers paragraphes : hey, je rapporte ce que j'ai vu. Et d'un coup, je comprenais bien plus la position de certains nationalistes. Je n'adhère pas. Mais comprends. Désolé si ça te choque. J'ai le même rapport aux idéologies chrétiennes extrémistes. La différence, c'est que ces dernières se sont fait suffisamment rabaisser en quelques décennies (même s'il y a du boulot à faire, encore !) et sont déjà plus timides. L'idéologie islamiste ne s’embarrasse pas des mêmes pincettes. Et oui, lorsqu'on les voyait parader avec leurs zolis drapeaux et leurs chouettes slogans, et qu'avec mon amie on s'est fait tout petit dans la foule environnante, j'avais plus l'impression de voir des fascistes marcher au pas que des manifestants assumer juste des opinions publiques ordinaires.

Le fait qu'on puisse considérer que la religion musulmane, au même titre que n'importe quelle religion du monde, a sa place en France, j'y crois totalement, hein. Qu'on puisse offrir une liberté totale de construire des mosquées, minarets, lycées privées, etc. aussi. Par contre, qu'on puisse chercher à m'imposer de ne pas rire ou me moquer, ou critiquer, une idéologie/une religion, que ça soit à travers des manifs anti-Piss Christ (où des hommes ont été brutalisés par des chrétiens extrémistes) ou anti-caricatures (où, à l'étranger, cela a tout de même provoqué des morts), ça me choque.

Hatred is not there for no reason. You think this camp in France was burned down just for fun? No, the hatred exists because roma people cause many problems (crime rates go up, drugs everywhere, etc.) but thee gypsies themselves don't give a fuck. Most of them don't even have any sort of ID, so they can't legally be brough to court for damages. Even if they get a letter (which is unlikely because they don't have a permanent place of residence) or a verbal request to come to court, they simply pack up and move somewhere further away.

We had a few groups of such gypsies not far away from where I live. They found a nice place near a big lake (it's a nature reserve, building anything is forbidden, so there were no houses close by), unpacked all their caravans and trucks and settled down for a couple months. Police kept coming daily and giving them tickets for parking too close to the lake and also littering, but hey, gypsies ignore the law on drugs. Surely they won't start following the law on littering.

Same thing as always has happened: people who live not far away (who come to the lake for some relaxation, fishing, etc.) got pissed enough and started breaking up the tents and stuff like that.

There's a ton of history here - as somebody with a degree in history, I should know - but that doesn't determine the future. Frenchmen, Dutchmen, it's all invented identities anyway. Nationalism is bollocks either way. You're being anachronistic in saying Sweden from 800 years ago has much to do with Sweden today as a nation. That's what our beloved Flemish nationalists like to do as well, and it remains idiocy. Modern nations and nationalism are a byproduct of the 18th and 19th century, anything before that is romanticism by dreamers. If you really think that, you're subscribing to some sort of 19th century school of historiography that serious scholars have long since discarded. Fuck, I could go on about how Caesar said Belgians were the bravest of all Gauls, but due to massive waves of migration since then, those original tribes are probably not more than a drop in the gene pool. So yea, the first mention of Belgians also dates to the Romans, how Romantic and completely irrelevant. 

Saying the Midwest is the American baseline is quite funny, and you're lucky most Americans haven't gotten down to this stinking conversation, 'cause they'd disagree. Saint Paul is a rather boring monocultural place compared to most of the USA, but that could be said about Sweden as well. Fuck, even your krimis are the worst in Scandinavia. ;)

I love how you say that Belgium is not in any way representative, but Sweden is and then turn around and say that until 1970 immigration was almost non-existant. That would make you the fucking anomaly, wouldn't it? Immigration has always been a powerful force in Europe, and one can see that in the Balkans, in Spain, in France (shit, France is nothing more than a mixing pot, even Celine acknowledges this at the start of Voyage Au Bout de La Nuit, and you can't call him a multiculti-lefty-loon, can you now) ... you missed how Danzig isn't German anymore, did you?

Your first point, by the way, is hilariously Europhobic (the commission is in league with everyone, yar yar, I bet you believe in Eurabia as well), but that is the baseline for the anti-European Breivikloving Rightwing, so that doesn't surprise me. I'm not going to be political correct and keep calling you people fascist though. It's not because the media has capitulated that you've changed. :)

Every month when I get my pay check, after deducting living expenses including abbreviation for apartment and car loans, I have approx 700 euros of money that I have no particular use. 

Currently, under the 30% capital tax, what I do with my money is to invest it into stocks. I make constantly valuations of what I see are future prospects of different SMEs and invest into their stocks, or pull out if I see their market conditions worsening. I myself am making valuation work, but the money is too working, it is capital, it is the money that enables companies to function.

Now lets say there would be 75% tax on capital gains. Would I invest into stocks? Hell no! I will either consume it or put somewhere where it can't be taxed. It is my money, I worked for it, I earned it and paid taxes for it, I'm not going to pay even more taxes on investing it.

And the reason why I'm saving and investing the money to stocks is that I want to gain some capital, so that one day when the opportunity arise, I or my friends have a good idea with good timing, I can leave my current job and create new start-up. Hopefully get rich by starting it. However if there would 75% tax on capital gains, you know what, I wouldn't be starting a start-up - what is the point of starting a company, taking risks and working your ass off so that the government can take 75% of the gains I make?

But think about what being rich means. It means having / consuming a lot more resources than the average person and that includes human resources or amount of time that people work for their needs.

Take the richest man on the world and let everybody else stop working for him in any way and he would have nothing almost instantly. Nobody to clean his home, no worker running a plant to provide his home with electrcity and heat, nobody to work the fields to produce food for him, nobody to wash his produce or wash his clothes.

This is kind of true for everybody in a complex society based on trade, that's true.
But it still means that there are many many people working ""in service"" for a rich person. If you look at the very rich and translate the money, you'd probably get a whole army working round the clock to provide all the luxury.

At this point you might say that they earned it while others will answer that many poor work very hard as well and then it's an argument about the free market and so on and so forth.

Obviously, in Swedish as well, but since there are other Scandinavians on this board, I hope you believe me when I say that the links do concerns ""wealth taxation in Sweden"". This particular link is an essay that have looked into it, and made the conclusion that it is not good for an economy like Sweden.

Sweden and France are not exactly alike, but some of the unintended consequences the wealth tax had here, would be good for Hollande to know, and, I believe, give him pause.

Apart from the flight of capital, the tax in itself actually didn't generate a lot of money. What it did however, was to provide a constant argument for everyone against the social democrats (that has, mostly been in power since WWII). Particularely during Göran Persson, our former prime minister, when Sweden was trying to be more competitive, more ""working on a global market"", trying to do tough reforms etc, it was a formidable argument for the opposition on how the social democrats weren't out to reform, how they hated wealth and success etc. 

It was removed by the government Reinfeldt (right) in 2007, but I have no doubt that Persson would have removed it himself, had he won the election, he was quite liberal, and above all, economically sound. I might add, the last years of the wealth tax, it was being called from left to right to remove it, both by prominent social democrats, even the odd communist, the union leaders etc. They recognised it for what is was, something that generated very little income, but a lot of bad press, and a lot of assumptions of their attitude, that they didn't want.

I must say, at least for me it is the same. What in God's name is France up to, might as well be my headline. Aren't they smart?  I understand that you do not care one iota about what I say, but you should care about the signals you send to the market. The wealth tax signals a lot to the market, and I don't think you can ignore that, as well as the capital flight. 

Finally, here is a French paper that says the wealth tax is bad.

South serbia (close to kosovo) is having illegal albanians coming daily and trying to take south serbia as well. Even here in Belgrade you can find albanians trying to buy a place illegally.

First of all, the 75 % is a marginal rate, i.e. you pay it for the amount *above* one million. If you tell me  - with your huge experience of investing a measly 700 euro - ""I wouldn't invest in that case"", then you're either stupid, terrible at math or deluded. Or please explain to me how - say - 250k profit on your second million isn't worth the bother?

Second, you seem to have a misconception about personal taxes. ""I'm not going to pay even more taxes on investing it."" Well, you're not. Investing is pretty much free. But you definitely *should* pay taxes on the amount of profit you earn from it, because I fail to see how that is different from earning it via work. And as I said: it's *not* money that works, it's people. So you might have an argument not to tax corporations, because those gains might get reinvested, but any money *you* earn should get taxed with your personal rate. It's the same as with inheritance - sure that money has been taxed, but now it's *you* that got it, so you should pay taxes for it.

Thirdly, you don't really ""invest"" if you put money in stocks. You are exchanging papers with other people that put some arbitrary value in that paper and bet that your valuation skill are better than theirs. Just listen to the crap they spew in the finance TV news, and you should get an idea that no one actually has *any* idea what that shit is worth. ""Yes Bill, the S&amp;P is up due to the good news on the labor front"". Yeah right.

*Investing* - as you said - means that you actually put money in businesses, enable them to make more money. If you ever get to this stage (which I doubt from reading your post), you most likely won't have enough cash in the first place, so you need to take in credit from other investors - which in turn will want control and tell you when to sit, jump and bark. The most likely outcome will be that you'll have a job - but work for them and not for a boss.

Anyway, I'm still missing a good reason (""I wouldn't like that"" doesn't qualify) as to why capital gains shouldn't be taxed at the income tax rate.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; First of all, the 75 % is a marginal rate, i.e. you pay it for the amount above one million. If you tell me - with your huge experience of investing a measly 700 euro - ""I wouldn't invest in that case"", then you're either stupid, terrible at math or deluded. Or please explain to me how - say - 250k profit on your second million isn't worth the bother?

Measly 700 euros per month addition to my personal fund... Non of the less 30% capital gains tax is still tolerable, there is plenty left for me. However if that tax would grow based on my income, the more I make the less I would have motivation to have more.

In case of that 1 million and 75% tax, there is huge difference, that money can buy you new car, new apartment or enable you to retire sooner. However more important than that is that it isn't terribly fair, you are contributing more to the society already, but what the state wants to do is to take most of it, not just part of it. If you think that the system is unfair then you don't have much motivation to work.

&gt; Second, you seem to have a misconception about personal taxes. ""I'm not going to pay even more taxes on investing it."" Well, you're not. Investing is pretty much free. But you definitely should pay taxes on the amount of profit you earn from it, because I fail to see how that is different from earning it via work. And as I said: it's not money that works, it's people. So you might have an argument not to tax corporations, because those gains might get reinvested, but any money you earn should get taxed with your personal rate. It's the same as with inheritance - sure that money has been taxed, but now it's you that got it, so you should pay taxes for it.

It is the capital working. And for the state is it is beneficial to allow successful individuals accumulate it as they will put it to a good use.

&gt; Thirdly, you don't really ""invest"" if you put money in stocks. You are exchanging papers with other people that put some arbitrary value in that paper and bet that your valuation skill are better than theirs. Just listen to the crap they spew in the finance TV news, and you should get an idea that no one actually has any idea what that shit is worth. ""Yes Bill, the S&amp;P is up due to the good news on the labor front"". Yeah right.

Or because I work in corporate environment I might see where things are going, not to mention that my co-workers and my friends are also too working in different sectors of the economy, by exchanging with each others on what is going on, one can induce a picture on where things are going to. It can be as simple as talking with BI-company representative about their sales outlook, for example one representative said that Nordics and especially Finland is one of their hottest sales areas.

&gt; Investing - as you said - means that you actually put money in businesses, enable them to make more money. If you ever get to this stage (which I doubt from reading your post), you most likely won't have enough cash in the first place, so you need to take in credit from other investors - which in turn will want control and tell you when to sit, jump and bark. The most likely outcome will be that you'll have a job - but work for them and not for a boss.

So? Of course the point is to lure at first angel investors and then via their contacts venture capitalists, of course they will give their input, but they have same goal as I, to make the start-up grow quick and make it profitable. Yes, I will loose control, and if and when we hit jackpot, I will get less than I would have without them, but heck, they gave the capital that enabled the growth. And what bad is having a boss or somebody to whom you answer? You are always answerable to somebody.

&gt; Anyway, I'm still missing a good reason (""I wouldn't like that"" doesn't qualify) as to why capital gains shouldn't be taxed at the income tax rate. Sure everyone does it that way because capital is sooo mobile and shy. But that's not a good reason in my opinion.

What you are looking for is moral justification, but the only moral justification on why we all shouldn't just get the same pay is because with this way everybody will have more, because there is incentive for everybody to work more.",0,1348947230,null,0,1348947544,0,c6f7x81,t3_10o0l4,t1_c6f7x81,t1_c6f7itn,null,1430022260,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"There are some more subtle nuances, but in general, it works like this:

""Du"" is for friends, family, people who look younger than ~18. Also people who participate in the same subculture (you rarely say ""Sie"" to people you meet in clubs, but that may depend on what kind of club it is) or, if you are a student, other students. 
Strangers in general are to be addressed with ""Sie"", but there are grey areas, like people younger than 25, if you're roughly the same age. That may depend on the context:  If it's informal, ""du"" might be better, but be careful in more formal settings, then you should use ""Sie"", just to be sure.
But if you're older, you're not perceived as part of the group, so if you're older than 30, don't use ""du"" for people in their 20s.
Whether you can use ""du"" for co-workers depends on the social climate of your company or wherever you work. In supermarkets you can sometimes hear a mix of polite and casual forms of addressing, like using ""du"" with ""Frau""/""Herr"" or ""Sie"" with the first name), but that's not very common.

If someone offers to use ""du"", you can just accept it. Don't offer it to someone who is older or of a higher social ""rank"" - wait until they offer.

So my advice is, try to observe people and their usage and try to internalize it. When in doubt, use ""Sie"", but don't worry about making mistakes too much.

true,LunaMinerva,null,null,"Take the *traghetto* to visit all the minor isles - especially San Giorgio Maggiore, where you'll find the homonym church designed by Palladio. Another Palladian building of note is Palazzo Foscari - take a look at the university Ca' Foscari while you're there. And of course there's also Biblioteca Marciana, whose design by Sansovino paved the way for Classicism in architecture.

La Fenice is Venice's major opera house, check it out. Unfortunately the current theatre is not the original from the late 18th century, as it has been rebuilt twice due to fires. Still, it's very beautiful and quite close to the original.

Avoid eating in restaurants too close to Piazza San Marco and the other main landmarks: most of them are tourist baits, the food is nothing too special and you'll be literally robbed. They speak well of 'Ai Mercanti', even though it's not the cheapest; I've never been there, though, so I can't vouch. *Trattorie* and *Osterie* are less sophisticated but the food is generally very good. And try *risotto*.

'Tonolo' is arguably the best patisserie in Venice: don't miss it. Try both 'normal' pastries and *frittelle*, which are typical of the Carnival period (especially those with *crema* - your mustard, more or less - and those with apples). I'm sure you won't regret it.

Not very far from IUAV (Venice's Architecture University) there's this extremely small and extremely crowded place called 'Bacareto da Lele' - it's awesome. They sell small sandwiches (always fresh, they serve so many people they just keep making them) and *ombre* (small glasses of wine) and it's very cheap. It's very rustic and unsophisticated, but the atmosphere is authentic. 

Try *espresso* in one of Venice's coffeehouses: they're different from cafès and bars in that they sell *only* coffee, and you can also buy it in powder or beans. One of them is 'Torrefazione Costarica'. And as far as *gelato* goes 'Gelatoteca Suso' is a must; it's near Ponte Rialto, but it's a little hidden.

It won't be hard to get lost in Venice - the fact that it's rather small will help. :)",0,1348952544,null,0,1348952965,0,c6f91yf,t3_10mhua,t1_c6f91yf,t3_10mhua,null,1430022792,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

Yeah, maybe, kinda, sorta. There is no real reason why that should actually be or remain the case. Europe is a pretty huge market, after all, and caries a lot of clout. So this could be subject to change. All it takes is a consensus and a little push.

&gt; And despite the happy lies you tell yourself, very few people like paying taxes or want to sacrifice more of their income so that their government may waste more.

Of course no one ""likes"" to pay taxes. I don't know where you get the idea that I'd claim that.

Yes, this intentionally-obfuscated scheme is difficult to comprehend. As it was designed to be. But at the same time it amounts to making a dodgy loan with taxpayer dollars. If the countries on the receiving end of the loan screw up, it is the taxpayer that won't be seeing his money again since the underlying loan being financed is still risky.

I do. Here is an article from the Economist who doesn't like it either. [Link](http://www.economist.com/node/21530093).

Above all, apart from the monetary flight, I can tell you what happened in Sweden. The financial gain from the wealth tax was actually rather small. But, at least since the 80's, it was used as an argument against the government (the social democrats) on how much they hated wealth, success, wanted millionaire to flee, etc. Not all the time of course, but a lot. It grew worse. At the end of the ""wealth tax"" life in Sweden (2007) a lot of people was calling for it to be abandoned. Not just the usual right, which one would expect, but some social democrats, some union leaders, the odd communists, etc. The only thing that the wealth tax conveyed by that time was:

""Entrepeneurs beware- If you make money Sweden will punish you""

""People with money beware - the state will punish you""

""Run, run like the wind with your money, we will punish you"".

I am exagerating a bit, but it is somewhat true. It did the biggst damage to the perception of the government/Sweden. 

I think that is the same for France. Yes, just like Sweden, they will experience a capital flight, but it will take years. 

But, what I, and it is not unlikely that some people in ""the market"" think the same, is that from now on, France will hunt/hate capital. If people make money, France will go after them. France is not interested in entrepeneurs, they want to punish them. 

That might not be right, but after our own experiences with wealth tax, I can't help but distrust the current government and thinking they do hate wealth/investors etc, after all, if you look at it from an economic standpoint, it is not even financially sound. They are doing it from an ideological standpoint, they do not like millionaires. 

That is not the best picture to convey to the market, but please France, go ahead. I will not stop you. I just wish we were Belgium and would get more of the money.",0,1348969833,null,0,false,0,c6fcr7w,t3_10o0l4,t1_c6fcr7w,t1_c6f9ezv,null,1430024614,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

They make your fucking iPads and jeans and electric devices but when they come knocking on your door for a better life (the same that you would have done) you just dismiss them easily by labeling them ""illegal"". 

See the fucking bigger picture man. No matter how many immigrants you beat up and torture, no matter how many you put in prisons, no matter how many walls you raise in Evros these waves will never stop. They are only getting bigger as the planet's population is massively rising. Only way for them to stop is if the first world supports the countries from where these people come, not just exploit like a fat little spoiled child all the resources of the world. 

If you are from Greece you probably have a relative or a friend who has someone who was an immigrant, back in the US in the start of the previous century, in Germany and Australia later, hell, even nowadays with thousands of people fleeing the country for a better life. It's the same thing. And you cannot even understand it. You are seeing the tip of the iceberg. 

When there were jobs in Greece and everybody wanted the immigrants for their crops and for the building blocks being built and for your Olympic Games of million of euros borrowed for a false sense of grandeur in the circus of consumerism, you really liked them back then doing all the dirty work. Now that they are not needed since there is no work for nobody and the market has sank, now Greeks have shown their true face, that of racism and of just looking for their ass. 

If you are from a middle or lower class and you are angry turn your hate to the fucking parliament, to the corruption, to the rich, to the rousfetia and fakelakia, to the client system of politics in Greece. And also to the troika whose austerity measures just sink the country deeper in recession. And the EU law that has turned Greece into a buffer zone of immigration without offering any support for the country. Turn your hate to these things and not to poor undefended immigrants (and don't fucking tell me they *all* steal and rape cause that is what the TV tells you by taking some incidents and creating all this fear mongering, they are fucking hundreds of thousands, most of them are peaceful and want just to work or leave the country anyway but they can't).

Wer lieber mehr Einstellungsmöglichkeiten hat und mehr Auswahl bei der Hardware, dafür aber mitunter ewig auf Updates warten muss kauft sich ein Android.

Der Hype, den Apple um ein Telefon ohne wesentliche Neuerungen veranstaltet ist lächerlich. Genauso peinlich sind aber die Werbungen von Samsung als Reaktion auf das neue iPhone. Genauso bescheuert wie die Anhänger beider Seiten, die sich gegenseitig die Köppe einschlagen.

&gt;In the November referendum the three options will be statehood, sovereign free associated state, and complete independence. Sovereign free associated state is basically the status quo but with more autonomy. 

And that is technically correct but irrelevant for two reasons.

1. There can be no change without consensus. Unless one of the status options gets an overwhelming number of votes there will be no change.

2. Puerto Rico can't change its status unilaterally, and this is what the US has to say about the enhanced commonwealth:

&gt;""(u)nder the Commonwealth option, Puerto Rico would remain, as it is today, subject to the Territory Clause of the U.S. Constitution (p. 26) and that ""consistent with the legal conclusions reached by prior Task Force reports, one aspect of some proposals for enhanced Commonwealth remains constitutionally problematic—proposals that would establish a relationship between Puerto Rico and the Federal Government that could not be altered except by mutual consent...such provisions would not be enforceable because a future Congress could choose to alter that relationship unilaterally.""

But even if the poll is meaningless, it will be rather interesting. Some supporters of independence are expected to vote for the enhanced commonwealth definition. The conservative faction of the commonwealth party rejects the new definition. And many members of the statehood party will not vote in the election as a rejection of their party's embrace of the Republican ideals.

So it's more a case of it being a label that has been tainted by history, than you thinking very differently from the average fascist. :) Same as how people are now running away from the ""multicultural"" label. 

You do the exact  same thing by bitching about ""multiculturalism"" and ""political correctness"", so lay off the victim mentality. Grachtengordel's keeping you down, oh yea. 

&gt; I have a problem with multiculturalism, yes. I also have a problem with race-mixing, yes. I think Africans should have kids with Africans, Europeans should have kids with Europeans, Asians should have kids with Asians, so on so forth.

See, that's a racist attitude. If you're being racist, I'll call you racist. It's very simple really. Ten years ago, when I had this discussion online, most of the right would just come out and admit they were racist and still adored the VNV (or NSV for you guys) ... I know it's not as politically correct these days to just call the extreme right racist, 'cause apparently that's ""stifling debate"" and ""hurting the feelings of ordinary people"" .... doesn't make it less true. It's pretty much the inverse of the debate in 1995. 

Kebab in the Netherlands is different from the Turkish Kebab. European Kebab as a whole has evolved a bit, just like ""Chinese food"" in Europe is not like Chinese food in China. There's a very European equivalent. In Belgium, for example, it's quite common for them to put fries in that. You think that's a Turkish custom?

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"&gt; What places would you recommend to someone who has never been to Europe and may never get a chance to see it again?

I like your pessimism about us blowing ourselves to smithereens, but you might be able to help out in the aftermath with the red cross or bringing some chocolate too.

So you get another chance or two, maybe.

&gt; What are the most important places that you wish everyone would visit?

First, I'd give the advice not to focus solely on the big cities and tourist attractions. If you can't live in a country, then at least try to go to the less travelled parts and mingle a bit with the locals. Then you've got more than just some pictures about where you went that everybody else has too.

That being said, I'll say that if you are interested in old buildings and culture, you should try to visist ruins and castles in the Scottish Highlands, maybe Edinburgh too (lovely city). In England, I'll say that York is a wonderful town for history-buffs too, because there you have large parts of the city wall still standing.

If you're not into that, but like to visit a smaller place, I'd recommend Maastricht. My brother studied there, and it is really lovely. Plus that's the place of the picture where they converted an old church into a library you always see on reddit.

And if you are a naturalist, and aren't satisfied with Scottish Highlands or need to see more, then the Alps are a must. Book a guide, and walk around for at least a day. It's great if you're from a place without real mountains.

To chill, I'd recommend southern France - Niece, Toulouse, Marseille. They're all great cities to party, too, especially Toulouse as it is a major student centre (and the semestre has begun right now).

Edit: Oh, for great cities Krakau (Poland) or Stockholm (Sweden) are very nice choices as well. Or so everyone I know who went there has told me.",0,1348996353,null,0,false,0,c6fh36l,t3_10p8l0,t1_c6fh36l,t3_10p8l0,null,1430026646,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Who pays all the administration costs? State or Church?
I guess state.
Let the church do it's own dirty work. Tithing should be voluntary too, imposing it as a tax undermines the good faith of the congregation. Not very Christian!

As for general advice, I've just started backpacking in Malaysia, and my advice would be that you can buy things when you're there, so don't worry too much about packing for every possible situation. Lugging around a huge pack is a pain in the arse (and back). Also, make sure you have a backup debit card or travellers cheques or some other means of getting money.

Generally, you can really easily navigate along the coast by trains as the main line follows the coastline. It could be a thing into itself, especially going eastward as it is quite beautiful.

Around Nice, westward, Antibes could be a good target, there is the Picasso Museum there, a castle and the sea front is really nice. 

Eastward, you can go to Eze or Villefrance (both nice villages) or even Monaco (the sea museum and its huge aquariums, as the botanical garden are quite interesting, the rest of the city not so much).

If you go inland, I would choose Vence, Tourrettes-sur-Loup or Saint Pierre de Vence, (all three are very close ot each other) : they are typical middle-age provence villages, very beautiful and with wonderful vistas. There are buses but it might be a bit longer to get there.

Don't hesitate to go to the tourism office, they are very competent, speaks a perfect english and can give you a tons of docs and info. IIRC, they are close to the train station.

Cela entraîne également une culpabilité de la femme (meurtrière : on parle bien de meurtre, hein, au-dessus) assez lourde à porter, et qui génère pas mal de dépressions, d'un rapport malsain à leur propre corps (qui donc, ne leur appartient pas totalement), etc.

There are a some really beautiful churches and cathedrals as well, France is full of them!

Unfortunately, I haven't been that much to Germany, but Nürnberg was a rather cozy place, and the cathedral of Köln (Cologne) is something well worth seeing IMO. If you're going in the near future, you might be able to get to the Oktoberfest in München (Munich) in time.

If you do get time over, I recommend trekking a bit farther east as well, like Gdańsk in Poland, Budapest in Hungary and Salzburg and Wien (Vienna) in Austria. Some of the post-communist countries might be a bit shabby, but the old cities still retain their charm, and with all the restoration work going on over there, most of them have already regained much of their former beauty.

And yes, the gang in question was a second-gen immigrant gang, but that hasn't been the focus at all in the Danish media (though everyone realises it, of course). The owner actually publicly declined a visit from the former leader of the anti-immigration Danish People's party saying that ""she's way too racist for me"". That was a really good move, I think. It shouldn't become a Muslims versus native white population issue, it should just be a normal people versus crime issue.

Yes.

I guess it depends on what the treaty is asking for, obviously there's something we don't agree with hence it's not getting signed.  Or should countries never object to treaties and just sign up because of good intentions?

If something so dangerous is already only producing a few deaths each decade, I'd say we're doing pretty well.

true,MadeInWestGermany,null,null,"I´m sorry that you have such rough times at the moment. First you shouldn´t even think about not taking the job. It´s a big chance to get out of this situation... But i´m sure you are aware of this. Just don´t let administrative barriers hinder you.

There aren´t enough detailed informations about your current legal status, location, age (it´s important if you are over or under 25 years) etc.. I would assume you get ALG2!? I´m not an expert in social law, but i just checked the social security code (Sozialgesetzbuch) and i´m pretty positive about your case.

First, you are pretty short of time, because you need the positive declaration before you pay anything. They usually wont refund you afterwards.

Since 2009 the issue changed very much because of a new law.

The most important law for you/your case would be:


""Übernahme von Umzugskosten nach §22 Absatz 3 SGB II !

This paragraph says, that under certain circumstances it is possible to get payed nearly everything you mentioned.

First we have to proof that your relocation is necessary and appropriate! The necessary-part is pretty simple, you are getting a job. The job is also 200 km away, so i guess you couldn´t reach it in the stipulated 2,5 hours

The reasonability-part is codependent on your rent. (Which i don´t know.) You should be allowed to get arround 50qm.

Now we have to look at the procurement costs of the new flat. You should file everything you pay. Including advertise, phone calls, Newspapers research...

You also mentioned a provision of 700€. Provisions will be only refunded if their is no provision free alternative. But i guess, you ment security deposit!? This would be easier, because the employment agency is able to loan it to you till the end of the tenancy. (If you don´t destroy the flat)
§22 Abs 3 SGBII

Further refundable  moving expenses would be the removal van, Boxes, mail forwarding instructions, notification of change of address, and catering of your helpers. It would be possible to hire professional movers if you can proof that you aren´t able to do it yourself. (Age, disease, handycaps...) Than you need to get 3 estimate of costs and the employment agency chooses one.

It´s also possible to gain rent payment for both flats (old and new) if you can proof that it wasn´t preventable. (cancelation period vs. job offer)

The Bundessozialgericht decided that §22 Abs 1 SGB II says it´s possible to refund the costs of renovation work in the new flat if the lease contract dictates them.

The renovation work in the old flat is a little bit catchier. The employment agency rates it non-refundable, but the social welfare court sometimes decides contrary. At least you can apply for it.

Well, this points should cover the whole ""Moving part"". All in all the limit of the moving expenses is 4500€

As i mentioned before, since 2009 all these benefits aren´t really determinated. The new basic concept is ""individualized support"". This means that you have the chance for all the benefits i mentioned, but at the end your consultant looks at your special case and decides for which benefits you are qualified and how much money you get. Based on his valuation, your arguments/proofs and the agencies current budget. (+ probably his personality...) Because of this its really important, that you speak to him as quickly as possible. Think about profound arguments and probably get advice from a lawyer, or independed counselor. There are several insitutions which will help you. And don´t surrender too fast. Even if they they refuse benefits. You allways have the right to enter an objection or even sue for your rights. (But remember the deadline)

I just want to say, that the guys at the job center are not really your enemies. They generally have a bad reputation, but i´m sure most of them really want to help you. And furthermore they have a basic interest in supporting your future plans, for the simple reason that they wont have to pay your unemployment benefit...;)

Well, i hope i didn´t wrote too much and that i could help you a little bit. As i said, i´m not an expert in social laws, but i tried my best to reflect this issue correct. No liability assumed!:D

 Anyhow, you really should visit an expert!

I wish you much luck with everything and of course fun in the glamorous working world..;)

Edit: I´ll forgot about your mobility problem. I´ll add some infos later. but i think §§ 53 Abs. 2 Nr. 3b, 54 Abs. 4 and § 45 S. 2 Nr. 2 §§ SGB III a.F. should be interesting for this topic.

The [Deposit Guarantee Fund of Credit Institutions](http://www.fgd.es/en/index.html) will pay up to 100,000 EUR per account holder in case a bank goes bankrupt.

For banks in deep trouble, especially for the ones in huge trouble such as Bankia (in need of in excess of 24 billion euros)  and Catalunya Caixa (in need of almost 11 billion euros), it has been proved it would be cheaper to let those banks go bankrupt (and pay up to 100,000 EUR per account holder from the FGD) than to bail them out. In fact, money for the FGD comes from the all the banks in Spain, not from State funds. Only investors will lose money, and well, investors should expect to lose money in some of their operations.

But of course most those banks' executives are mostly former politicians from the biggest political parties in Spain: PP, PSOE, and to a lesser extent CiU. Corruption has been rampant in their management, and they do not want by any means a proper investigation of that. Bailing out the banks will avoid a proper investigation.

So yes, it is definitely class warfare.
