Germany has already spend several hundred billion Euros for the rescue of Greece. Now what do you expect Germany to do? Hand over a blanco cheque, so that Greece might survive another two years, until their broken economy collapses again because their politicians fail to initiate necessary reforms?  For ten years Greece was borrowing money on the low interest rates that came with the Euro. For ten years the Greece government did nothing to fight corruption or to initiate the reforms that would have been necessary to fix their broken economy. Just because it was to comfortable to live on low interest rate. Germany went through reforms ten years ago, and believe me, it was no fun, but it was necessary and it pays off now. For me it's astounding, that all are focusing on Germany while no one asks, what the Greece government has done the past ten years - or what they not have done.

Greece will receive money. They are already receiving money. Otherwise they would have went bankrupt months ago. They will receive loads of money, and several hundred billion Euros are coming from Germany. So far. The first economic recovery plans were initiated as well - with the aim to create jobs and growth and improve the infrastructure. Greece will receive money, but not for free. It's time for them to show the will to fight corruption, increase the efficiency of their administrative machinery, to get the taxes from the rich (which literally didn't happen the past ten years) and to enforce necessary reforms like many other countries including Germany already did years ago.

Barajas Airport is on the upper right corner (soft pink line), and Chamartin is left of it (clear blue and dark blue).

Avoid taxis, sometimes they try to trick foreigners charging them a lot more than the real price (and it will be at least 10 times more expensive).

If you are going to stay for some days, the ""10 travels"" tickets are worth it (under 10€ IIRC). Keep in mind that Metro tickets also work in the buses inside Madrid (the blue ones), but only in those. Also, look for tourist passes.

If you are going to visit all Spain, **buy a Eurail Pass**, it's a fucking bargain.
http://www.eurail.com/eurail-passes/one-country-pass/spain

Don't mistake it with the InterRail Pass, which is only for european citizens.

Also, get a IYHF card, which allows you to sleep in hostels for a really cheap price (if you don't have the card somwtimes it will be more expensive, but sometimes you won't be allowed to stay at the hostel; you need a IYHF card to stay at some hostels, keep that in mind).

Here you have a hostel searcher
http://www.hihostels.com/
There are more, look for them.

And I think you will be fine with the money you are spending. I visited France, Belgium and Netherlands for 16 days with less than 800 €.

true,belgianguy,BELG,Belgium,"&gt; European Industry Commissioner Antonio Tajani says the agencies “work for the dollar” by constantly downgrading the credit ratings of European countries. The commissioner accused them of “blackmail,” referring to their announcement of downgrades before the EU summit on January 30, 2012, where a tax on financial transactions was to be discussed.

I've had the same conversation with some friends, and at one point this same sentiment came up. None of us thought it was far-fetched that these rating agencies might not be as neutral as they claimed to be. But this conversation went even further and ended up bringing forward a theory that these rating agencies might be artificially propping up the dollar by continually kicking the legs from under the Euro when it tries to get up. And now, after another turbulent (but hopeful in the context of the Euro) event, the same behavior appears. It's odd, really, and while I can't deny said theory sounds very conspiracy-like, I can't  disprove it either. Now that I read that such sentiment is even shared by higher-level politicians, I'm not sure what to think about it.

in addition, even if we were: what happened in Greece (just like the subprime bubble in the states) has been played out as if people one day woke up and suddenly realized that the whole system is busted.

let's say that is true (which it isn't. it's been presented that way, but these things don't just ""happen"" overnight, so someone must have known and shut up about it). if this is true, then there are three explanations:

1. capitalism doesn't work, or it works only under superheavy regulations and control. if it worked, if the mythical ""gentle hand of the market"" could really take care of everything, then we wouldn't be in this situation.

if capitalism doesn't work, the discussion shouldn't be ""how we save as much as we can so that we can keep going?"", but ""how do we dump a system that has ruled our working life for at least a couple of centuries, and still manage not to go back to ancien regime-type societies?"" No such debate going on in most circles to this date.

2. capitalism can work, but it needs regulations. next time someone proposes a commission to check each EU nation's fiscal health and the germans (among others) disagree, like it happened in the years before Greece became the source of all evils, we should realize we're asking for troubles. next time someone comes up and asks for deregulations, we should realize he's really asking for helping him or his friends to cause the next market crash.

again, no such debate going.

3. capitalism work, the market can take care of itself. then, obviously, there was a big cover up of the situation in Greece. to all the people that shout and scream that Greece should be kicked out of the Euro because they cooked their books to get in, I would like to ask: instead of directing your rage to Greece and its population, how about focussing it on your own politicians, economic experts, journalists, bureaucrats, etc that either didn't have a clue (and so are guilty of not being able to do their job, and should not hold public office) or knew and did not say a work (thus causing so much misery to an entire continent and possibly the world)?


I don't see another solution. However one puts it: yes, the greeks are responsible and should ""pay"" in one way or another (possibly one that doesn't completely fuck them up in the short, middle and long run, so that they can actually help themselves out of this pickle). but if the population is responsible (and it is, in its way), so are countless other ""big figures"" who are not being asked anything. not money (that they must have put in their pocket), nor explanations (this money disappear, apparently, because the greeks are corrupted and can't take care of themselves. mmmmmh.....), nor political or career ""paybacks"".

quite simply, once again, the system is not fair because there's always the same people that pay, and there's always the same people that prosper, or, at worst, manage to keep their lives together without stressing too much.",0,1329240091,null,0,false,0,c3r5nrs,t3_pnbme,t1_c3r5nrs,t1_c3r3b3t,null,1428352678,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The goal is to prevent this crisis from spiraling (even further) out of control.

true,Raerth,ENGL,England,"&gt;But how posting in original language could harm r/europe? 

Let me begin by saying I have no problem with non-English sources being linked, the rule was not my creation.

I agree that it is not very difficult for people to use google translate on articles they don't understand, but I would also point out that you may be vastly limiting the audience if you post a link that 60-90% of subscribers cannot read. I'm fairly confident that a lot of people will not bother to translate the source unless they can first read something in a language they understand which summarizes the article.

If we change the rule to allow non-English articles, I predict that English articles will attract more attention than a previously submitted non-English one.

That said, if people really want the change I would be happy with it. We can run a poll on this later if you want?",0,1329242730,null,0,false,0,c3r66c3,t3_pozwz,t1_c3r66c3,t1_c3r3bh6,null,1428352919,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

It's like going to your local newspaper and telling them to stop writing about sports because you're not interested in sports and you think the sports section attracts sports fans and they will ruin the quality.

To me it just seems like a major general subreddit (like I assume r/europe is) should be free of such ""regulations"". If a certain number of people desire to have **only** serious news and discussions about Europe they should create a subreddit just for it, like r/europenews or whatever. If people desire to share a lot memes about Europe they should create their own r/memeurope. But the main general r/europe should be just open to anything *""Europey""*. A lot of subreddits sort stuff like that. I personally think that's dumb in this case because there aren't going to be THAT many memes making it to the frontpage.. but if that is the case.

I once posted a rage comic in here that was only relevant to this subreddit. It wasn't something that would have never made any sense as a self-post and noone definitely writes articles on the guardian about it.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"They can't be expelled directly, but they could be given a strong incentive to exit ""voluntarily"". Greece would be out very quickly if there were no more bailout payments. They would default disorderly, and then they'd pretty much have to go back to the drachma and almost certainly would exit the EU entirely.

However, imagine you're a big time bond investor, and you've just seen the Eurozone dropping Greece like a hot potato. You'd have to assume that this would be a precedent for other countries. Portugal and Ireland are already disconnected from the bond markets, but Italy and Spain aren't. If you'd have to assume that the Eurozone wouldn't bend over backwards to keep them afloat if things got worse, then you'd either price this risk into interest rates you demand for buying their bonds, or choose bonds from safer countries instead. (Even) higher interest rates would make Italy's debt (even more) unsustainable, and Spain would be seen as extremely risky because they'll have high unemployment for the long term and are very exposed to Portugal, should the Eurozone drop them, too. So, there would be a risk of some of the larger Eurozone economies, that right now have big but still manageable problems, to get pushed over the brink.

Other consequences would be that a Greek default would trigger credit default swaps, and nobody really knows how large this problem is. Some banks might have to get bailed out, meaning more debt for governments, and even those that would normally be fine in principle would have problems because the other banks would have to assume that they aren't (essentially, like after the Lehman Brothers fiasco).  
There's also the direct exposure to Greek debt, but that's less problematic.

However, you may have heard quotes out of the Eurozone that ""day X"" is getting less scary. The longer it doesn't happen, the more time the financial sector has to prepare for the impact, and they have come a far way from the early days of the crisis already. The banks are currently in the process of ""voluntarily"" taking a 70% loss. Other troubled countries are working on getting their budget under control, and the Eurozone is stocking up on bailout funds. Partially, all this is done to fix underlying issues, but another objective is to minimize the risk of contagion in case push comes to shove.

Last but not least, you can hear a lot of emphasis on Greece being a special case. Apart from it being true, this serves two purposes: One is to ensure markets that if the Eurozone lets Greece sink, that this wouldn't be a precedent for other countries. The other purpose is to put pressure on Greece (and calm domestic voters) by making it clear that the other members aren't willing to keep throwing money at the problem if there aren't reforms, just to avoid contagion, and that they are indeed prepared to let Greece default if they don't deliver.

So, yes, there is a possibility that it might happen, but it's small. It would be very risky, and it probably would be more expensive than to keep bailing them out. There also might be a tiny shred of European solidarity in there, because it almost certainly would be even worse for Greeks than what they have to endure already -- when you read people claiming otherwise keep in mind that they're proposing a very risky bet with *extremely* high stakes.

But then I found a comment in the NYT comment section that said the article seemed biased. Any Greeks interested in reading the article and putting it into perspective.

Here's the quote from the NYT, as of my writing, 3rd highest rated comment, (with 1st and 2nd being more general political comments, rather than being about the article itself)

&gt;I've lived in Greece for two years, and somehow this piece doesn't ring true. It feels like the writer had an idea for what he wanted to write, and then found people and quotes to support it. In that sense, I'd say this piece represents the worst kind of reporting. No one here believes a sense of community will save them. Greeks are loyal to their family and closest friends, and that's it. They distrust their government and routinely blame others -- bankers, Germans, the Second World War -- for their troubles. They never take responsibility for their actions, and never speak well of each other. The Greek people haven't figure it out yet: you are where you are because of who you are. And everyone here, to the extent they are Greek, is to blame. The situation, though dire, has degenerated into farce. The public looks to the same corrupt leaders who got them into this mess to get them out. The police drink coffee and smoke cigarettes with the rioters and fire-starters. I would like to end this by asking the writer, ""Did you ask the people you interviewed if they paid income taxes in any of the last twenty years?"" I believe I am right in saying that in all of Greece, only 5,000 people declare an annual income of 100,000 euros or more. It is routine for doctors to declare incomes of less than 10,000 euros. It is unprecedented, perhaps, in the whole history of the world. An entire nation of cheats. Don't pity a single one.

The EU has levels of indebtedness around 80%, well below the USA (100%) and Japan (220%). Despite US levels debt increasing by 40% in the last 5 years, it is still able to finance its debt without major problems.

“Apart from Greece (158 percent), even the European countries affected most by the crisis are not excessively indebted: In Spain, the national debt level is 68 percent, in Portugal 102 percent, in Ireland 112 percent, and in Italy 120 percent, about the same level as when it joined the euro zone. German (82 percent), French (85 percent) and British (80 percent) government debt are around the average level of the OECD countries.

There must be other causes to account for the fact that Europe has become the target of the international financial markets. To probe deeper it is necessary to consider the social changes that have taken place over the last three decades.”

*""But by far the most important issue is education. Lithuania is trying to improve the quality of Lithuanian-language teaching in schools (amid a wrenching decline in school numbers) and has required the Polish-language schools to teach more subjects in Lithuanian. This has sparked a furious protest by local Poles, readily echoed in Warsaw.""*


Lithuania has 48.8% of all the foreign polish schools (55 Polish-only and 28 mixed Lithuanian and Polish schools) while only 2.05% Poles live here. There's additional 15-200% of financing for foreign schools. Until recently all subjects could be tought in Polish. The parliament passed an education reform some time ago which requires everyone to pass national level language exam before graduating from school together with a plan to teach more subjects in Lithuanian (especially history of Lithuania). Teachers were promised extra compensation for additional efforts teaching Lithuanian language and students were given transitional period.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I don't know why I keep writing ""tax withdrawal"" when I mean ""tax evasion"", but I did mention it. It's definitely a major problem. Greece now resorts to collecting property taxes via the electricity bill. Other creative solutions include using taxes on swimming pools as a proxy for high income, but they just cover them up so they don't appear on aerial photographs. Think about that for a moment.

The report about the Porsche owners has been shown to be false, AFAIK, but the point that high income earners in Greece tend to evade taxes is still true. I think of it as more of a symptom of the dysfunctional bureaucracy than the primary cause for Greece's problems, though. The state seems incapable of identifying high income earners, and corruption prevents controls from being effective if the happen at all. With conditions like this, the problems are hardly limited to this specific aspect of public administration, but affect e.g., contracts for public construction work as well. So, if Greece would magically manage to get tax evasion down to normal levels, a whole range of other bureaucratic inefficiencies would still exist, and that level of corruption, nepotism and incompetence would still add a significant overhead to the economy and keep it from becoming internationally competitive.

How can they expect businesses to keep their books in order if the government falsifies its own data? When the new head of ELSTAT, the new Greek statistics agency, corrected the data and tried to abolish practices like voting on numbers, he got investigated for ""breach of faith against the state"", which carries a life sentence. It's bizarre.

Anyway, the problem with wide spread tax evasion isn't just the lack of revenue. Not all taxes are difficult to collect, it's relatively easy to deduct taxes from an employee's paycheck, especially if it's a public employee. So those are the taxes the government has to increase to raise revenue, which leads to more social inequality. They can (and do) raise other taxes, but raising taxes that are easy to evade is less effective, because then tax evasion itself increases. It's not just that the financial incentive is higher, those who actually pay the taxes simply feel stupid if their neighbor doesn't and gets away with it, and businesses would have to charge higher prices than their tax evading competitors.  
Similarly, that there are many rich Greeks who don't pay their taxes makes things like the bailout packages politically difficult for other countries -- effectively, I have to pay the taxes that some of those Greeks who make significantly more than me don't, just because my country is in a better position to collect.

The claim that the only alternative to the brutal austerity measures demanded by the ""troika"" and banks (i.e. ""private money markets"") is state bankruptcy and economic disaster have a hollow ring, when one deals with the objective reality of the impact of the demands of the ""private money markets"" and the austerity measures.

&gt;Eighteen months of austerity have produced a social decline that is unprecedented in peacetime. Wages and salaries in the private sector have decreased by 20 percent and in the public sector by up to 50 percent. Over one million Greeks, one in five adults and one in two young people, are unemployed. Only a third of these receive unemployment benefits, which are now due to be reduced from €460 ($600) to €360 ($470) per month.
The new austerity package passed Sunday evening will reduce the working class and broad layers of the middle class to a naked struggle for survival. By 2015, an additional 150,000 state employees are to be laid off and an additional €11.4 billion slashed from the budget, with even more cuts in public-sector wages. With prices for basic commodities at Western European levels, survival will be impossible for many, especially if they have to support destitute family members.
One does not have to be a mathematical genius to see that these measures will not solve, but only worsen the debt crisis. All economic indicators are pointing downwards. The economy shrank by 7 percent last year, industrial output by 16 percent. Despite an increase in the VAT rate, revenues from the tax declined by 19 percent because 60,000 small and family businesses went bankrupt. A further 50,000 bankruptcies are expected this year.

There are no definite standards and it depends very much on the type of business.)

Germans value reliability above all, i'd say, so if you want to impress them, don't ever be late, don't promise more than you can deliver, deliver what you promised. Americans have the reputation of being ""too superficial"" (a cliche, but you will have to deal with that in germany), so while being polite is important in most contexts, Germans will be sceptical if you are ""overly friendly"".

Don't mention the war. Don't disrespect football. Don't lecture us about american culture, we think we know everything about it. This of course is not true, but we will ask questions later, when trust is established to some degree. Germans tend to be very ambilvalent towards americans.

Instead, germans from the south will be easily flattered if you point out how beautiful their area is (however boring it might be). It's harder in the north of germany, but basically the same thing, they will like it when you notice and appreciate the details, like the nice town hall, the nice pubs, stuff like that. There are considerable differences of mentality in different parts of Germany, which might complicate things.

Overall it's comparatively easy in germany for americans, i'd say, just pay attention to reactions, don't take ""weird"" stuff personal, and roll along. ",0,1329294129,null,0,true,0,c3rf0kq,t3_ppq6b,t1_c3rf0kq,t3_ppq6b,null,1428357136,11,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,11

Well, they can always choose to refuse to pay their loans. How will that help them, given the fact that they need new loans every few months to fund their governmental expenses? How will it be better than the current EU-brokered deal, that also cuts 70% of their debt?

&gt;when one deals with the objective reality of the impact of the demands of the ""private money markets"" and the austerity measures.

Objective reality is that Greece needs imports and trade, and therefore has to be *somewhat* compliant with the standards in vogue in the rest of the world. 

What is their alternative that *doesn't* necessitate heavy budget cuts?

&gt;You go on to say ""an alternative is to patch up the hole with European money"" this ignores the fact that the rich of Greece have stashed away €560 billion in foreign accounts, which is almost twice the entire Greek national debt, why not use this?

While preferable, that money is effectively unreachable. Nothing is stopping Greece itself from doing exactly that, proving that cutting the budget is easier - given the fact that it'll probably end the political career of most people who voted in favour, that's significant.

&gt;I also feel that you have somewhat ignored and consequently not responded to the data that outlines that your initial claim that the Greek and European crises is based on debts that are no longer payable or can be refinanced does not stand up to investigation.

Given the political constellation in and the current construction of the EU, it is automatic nor inevitable that other EU countries will jump in to share the debt burden. Therefore, the debt capacity of the rest of Europe is not yet relevant.

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"&gt;I'm guessing the Romanian Hungarian Party is just as shitty as the Serbian Hungarian Party, which supported the Milosevic government.

The RMDSz Hungarian Party here would never have supported [PRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Romania_Party). They were (and are) sworn enemies. But the party does have its fare share of corrupt folk. Verestoy Attila is the most notorious for his business involving timber (from the forests of the Szekler Land)

&gt;You know, maybe the Romanian Romanian parties should fix the situation on their own, without pressure from the minorities.

The Romanian Romanian parties do not have platforms for the Hungarian constituency. Even in areas where Hungarians form the majority, the Ro-Ro parties represent the Romanians. I guess the unwritten consensus is that Hungarians are the RMDSz's constituency. Plus the fact that addressing Hungarian issues by a Ro Ro party is risky politically. They would probably lose votes in the non-Transylvanian areas of Romania.

Also, the RMDSz is the more moderate of the 3 Hungarian parties (and the oldest and the only one to have MPs). The others are the [Hungarian Civic Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Civic_Party_\(Romania\)) and [László Tőkés](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laszlo_Tokes)'s People's Hungarian Transylvanian Party (or something along those lines, a rather new party). I would personally like to see something more inclusive along the lines of the [Most - Hid party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most%E2%80%93H%C3%ADd) from Slovakia.

Another thing I'd like to question is how you can [have a shadow economy that is estimated to 27 % of the economy](http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2011/07/11/110711ta_talk_surowiecki) if only 1 % are the bad guys?

[How the Greeks retired earlier and with more pension than other countries](http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90853/7167301.html). Yes.

[Where Greece is on the corruption list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index). You do not get that low without it penetrating every aspect of society.



This is not the working of 1 %. This is systematic failure by the society as a whole, and yes, the average Greek did contribute to it. Perhaps they didn't think it would lead to this, perhaps they didn't think it was so bad, but to say the average Greek didn't know, or never did anything is like saying a 200 kg chainsmoking man is taken by surprise when he has heart problem. This might be the moral attitude someone was talking about in an earlier thread, but it does pisses me off when someone blatantly ignores fact and make themselves out to be completely innocent.

true,Narvaez,null,null,"San Sebastian... what a fantastic city. I'll try to make a brief resume:

San Sebastian is a wonderful place if you like water sports and the beach, it has three fantastic beaches and one of them ""la concha"" is very famous. Zarauz, a near city, is great for practicing surf.

Places to eat... well, San Sebastian is the perfect city to eat, there are plenty of good restaurants, mostly in the old part of the city, and you will have the opportunity to eat the famous ""pintxo"", like the famous spanish ""tapa"" but a more elaborated version, cheap and delicious, lots of seafood. 

There are also world-famous restaurants like ""Arzak"", or the famous restaurant of ""Karlos Arguiñano"", but they are expensive and exclusive. San Sebastian and the province (Gipuzkoa) happens to have some of the most famous cooks in the world, Juan Mari Arzak, Karlos Arguiñano, Martin Berasategui, Pedro Subijana, and of course my absolute favorite David de Jorge (not so famous, but huge).

If you like to eat the ""typical"" food of the countryside you can go to a ""Sidreria"", a restaurant where they make their own cider and you eat a menu which includes a huge steak caled ""chuleton"".

The city itself has a lot to see, it was burned to ashes by the french and rebuilt, it has a military past, you can visit the mount ""Urgull"" if you like the napoleonic warfare, the naval museum and aquarium are nice visits. In the countryside you can also find a lot of interesting places to see.

Cultural agenda: international cinema festival, heineken jazzaldia (jazz festival), the day of st. thomas, the day of S. Sebastian (January 20th) where a huge parade called ""la tamborrada"" takes place. You should also check the ""Kursaal"", an auditorium, for concerts.

Near places to visit: Pamplona (of course), where the ""Sanfermines"" take place every year in july, Irun, a near city in the frontier with France (smuggled parfum? lol), Zarauz, Bilbao (the guggenheim museum), Vitoria (good wine my friend), and the french cities of Hendaye and Bayonne.

I could keep going for hours... but my recommendation: get along with locals, hang out with them and you will have the best time of your life. 

Oh... I almost forgot to mention, the province is bilingual (basque and spanish), so expect to see a lot of words that you won't understand, it's normal, don't worry, everybody speaks spanish, and if they see that you make an effort to understand basque language you will be highly rewarded with friendship.",0,1329304693,null,0,true,0,c3rfqi7,t3_pqbrq,t1_c3rfqi7,t3_pqbrq,null,1428357480,6,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,6

Again you ignore the the fact that the rich of Greece have stashed away €560 billion in foreign accounts and decide to attempt to lay the blame for the Greek and European crises at the door of the working class, the workers of Greece have not caused this crises the banks, financial institutions and their political representatives have caused the crises.

&gt;Objective reality is that Greece needs imports and trade, and therefore has to be somewhat compliant with the standards in vogue in the rest of the world.

What you conveniently missed out of this selective quote are the statistics that highlight the devastating social impact of Greece being ""somewhat compliant with standards in vogue in the rest of the world"" and again attempt to promote the hollow argument that if the austerity measures are not implemented Greece faces economic disaster. You clearly refuse to accept the reality that for the working class, economic disaster has already struck.

&gt;While preferable, that money is effectively unreachable. Nothing is stopping Greece itself from doing exactly that, proving that cutting the budget is easier - given the fact that it'll probably end the political career of most people who voted in favour, that's significant.

Firstly, what is stopping Greece from seizing the €560 billion in foreign accounts, is an unelected, undemocratic, technocratic government of bankers who represent the interests of the banks and the rich and would much rather implement austerity measures on the workers of Greece than seize the billions of the very people who caused this mess. Your concern for the political careers of politicians who are nothing but the gimps of the European financial elite, while expressing not one iota of concern for the devastating impact their decisions are having on millions of Greek workers, is more than a little disturbing. 

Let me stress again, €560 billion in foreign accounts is almost double the Greek debt, if paying of the Greek debt was the issue, then why is there no political will to seize this money? The debt would be paid of today!!

&gt;Given the political constellation in and the current construction of the EU, it is automatic nor inevitable that other EU countries will jump in to share the debt burden. Therefore, the debt capacity of the rest of Europe is not yet relevant.
The best thing that can come out of this crisis is more political integration, with a reduction of corruption as goal. That will help Greece the most in the long run

You appear to be missing the point about levels of debt. Your initial claim  “The choice was made when Greece decided to take out loans it couldn't pay back, using their sovereignty as pledge"" does not stand up to ivestigation. Countries such as Japan have much higher levels of debt than Greece yet do not face the same attacks from the banks, financial institutions and ""private money markets"" and still manages to finance its debt without any problems.

You also still fail to explain why countries with relevant low levels of debt such as Spain where the national debt level is 68 percent, in Portugal 102 percent, in Ireland 112 percent, and in Italy 120 percent, about the same level as when it joined the euro zone and indeed   French (85 percent) and British (80 percent) are also under attack from the banks, financial institutions and ""private money markets"". 

How you can be talking of ""political integration"" and ""reduction in corruption"" when Greece and Italy both have unelected technocratic governments carrying out the demands of the banks to the huge disadvantage of the populations of these two countries is an absurdity.

That is rich coming from someone who asked if I was German? I am not, but what does that has to do with statistic from OECD (which I noticed you haven't  countered) or articles from the Economist. Who hands out links to threads like this, to discuss Greeks burning flags?  What infantile person burn flags, or admires it? 



&gt;Greece was constructed at the start of the 19th century,

Like Belgium, Italy and Germany as well by the way. Portugal, military dictature until 1974. And don't get me started on Eastern Europe, under Sovjet rule until 1989. That is no reason, nor is an excuse to lie and cheat. So, because you have been under foreign rule, you do not have to construct a sustainable pension system? Is that really your argument? What countries in Europe hasn't been under foreign rule. Not many, but I don't see Finns, Estonians, Hungarians, Irish, or anyone else blaming that. I have to ask you how old you are? So any country, that has anything bad, or even a lot of things bad happen to them, do not have a responsiblity, for all time? Do you think you are the only country in the world with problems? 

You still haven't countered my arguments that the Greeks themselves contributed to the downfall by being very ineffective, by cheating and retire early (and raising salaries much more than they could afford). the only argument you have had is ""History hasn't always been nice to us, therefore we are allowed to behave bad"". *Every* country has shit in their history, you just choose how to deal with it. 

Oh, here are links from Spanish and Dutch papers, so you see that is not just the Germans.

In other words, if your plane is supposed to land at 9:30, don't expect to be in the train station at CDG before noon (best case).

TGV is your best option, but there are very few trains that go directly from CDG to Aix, so you'll probably have to go from CDG to the « Gare de Lyon » inside Paris to board a convenient TGV towards Aix.

The RER B express metro is somewhat expensive from CDG, but convenient and reasonably fast. Stop at the station « Châtelet les Halles » in the center of Paris, and board the RER A towards « Gare de Lyon »

Also, check with train station is most convenient for your arrival, depending on where exactly you have to be by night, and plan on how you'll get there from the train station. Cabs are expensive and may not be numerous at night, buses usually don't run after a certain hour.

&gt;Greece was constructed at the start of the 19th century, by other European countries

*Belgium* was *constructed* at the start of the 19th century, bacause the winners of the Napoleonic wars wanted it so. Unfortunately, this was not was the Belgians wanted ( or seem to want at the moment, since the country is hugely divided). They do not use this as an excuse to be number 80 on the corruption list or to build up a shadow market that is 25 % of the economy. 


A bad history does not  give you the reason not to construct a sustainable pension scheme 200 years later, you are mixing apples with oranges. Very few countries do *not* have a bad history. One has to look forward, not backwards and stop blaming everyone else. The Estonians do not behave like you do. Neither does the Belgians, the Poles etc. Other countries have been constructed too, or have definately suffered more (I think every 6th Pole died in WWII), not to mention countries like South Korea etc. The only one who can fix Greece is the Greeks, and you will never do it until you accept more blame than you are letting on. 


And- you are still not answering why Greeks are cheating on their taxes. Because a you didn't like what happened in 1821 you use that as an excuse to behave immoral almost 200 years later. It sounds to me like the sort of reasoning that is used in the Middle East, and it always ends up with both sides being loosers and no one is the winner.


And yes, I did read the comment. Have you read all my links? Do you want me to give you more articles from more countries, or are you still determined to accept none of the blame, and to keep saying that everything is Germanys fault?

Bureaucracy and inefficiency fun fact of the day: the building registrations are kept in dead tree form, and so are the land use registries which are decentralized; the IRS has no way to independently verify that your immobile assets are what you state, and there has been considerable backroom pressure to not get them digitised and networked.

As a personal example, it has been so far impossible for my wife to get an official listing of land plots that she has an ownership stake of (apparently, to evade taxes her extended family decided to give her unilaterally ownership of some land while she was still a kid, and several people have since died, and took that knowledge  with them).

E-mail sent from the office of Amelia Anderstotter (Pirate Party MEP):
&gt;Dear all

&gt;It has come to our attention via twitter that there seems to be some
rumors that the European parliament automatically sends Acta related mails
to the spam bin. As me and Amelia is on the inside she suggested that I'd
let you all know that this is not true.

&gt;The mail that get sent to the MEPs are handled in microsoft outlook and
the control over the spam filter in outloook is entirely in the hand of the
individual MEP. The default setting for the spam filter is ""low"" and in
that setting roughly somewhat less than 10% of the acta related emails that
was sent to Amelias account got sent to the spam bin. Those mails were all
identical and sent more or les at the same time which i probably why the
spam filter reacted. 

&gt;So, to sum it up: with the default settings a tiny minority of the
acta-related emails got sent to the spam bin. The control of the spam
filter is in the hand of the individual MEP. If you take the time to
actually write the email yourself and adressing the individual MEP instead
of mass sending emails to all MEPs at the same time your email do not risk
being stuck in the spam filter at all regardless of the topic. 

&gt;Feel free to spread this information to anywone who've expressed concerns
regarding the spam filters in the parliament.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hey. relevant question here: I'm a German native, and the article you linked to doesn't mention spam filters *at all*. I found remarks about it in the comments, but the article, as it stands now, doesn't mention it.

EDIT: I did a exact quote search for ""Die Parlamentsverwaltung hat entschieden"" which is a part of the quote that stated that the administration of the parliament decided to mark ACTA emails as spam. 

Here's what, possibly, maybe even most probably happened: 

The Taz article is dated to Feb 14. Several of the exact quote results (see above) predate this day. I suspect Taz didn't factcheck the statement, put it into the article, and then edited it out afterwards. 

EDIT 2: Here's another German newspaper, that first quoted taz on this, then added that EU Parliament stated the claim is untrue.
http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/kritisiertes-anti-piraterie-abkommen-acta-ist-am-ende-1.1284545

Given that I have seen no direct evidence or quote of this supposed decision, I'm now 90% sure it was a hoax, with the intention to get ACTA opponents (a group to which I belong as well) up in arms.

If that's what happened, it would be incredibly sleazy by taz, by the way: repeating an unsourced statement, and then not even owning up to it after removing it.",0,1329318151,null,0,true,0,c3rgypd,t3_ppwwp,t1_c3rgypd,t3_ppwwp,null,1428358077,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,cauchy37,CZEC,Czech Republic,"I'm Polish and I live in Czech Republic for 4 years now, the basic understanding is fine, but try and have a meaningful conversation with Czech and you will find yourself misunderstood and they will be confused as well. There are too many words that sound similar but mean something completely else (or even positive), for instance

* *čerstvé pečivo* - fresh bread 

* *czerstwe pieczywo* - old bread 

* *děkujeme za nápady* - thank you for ideas

* *dziękujemy za napady* - thank you for robery

* *šukat* - to fuck

* *szukać* - to search

There are then more and more words that are completely different with both sound and meaning.

You can understand and even communicate with foreigners, but notice that very often you have to look for synonyms, you have to use hands or other body parts to gesture what you mean.

To communicate on a level that both of you understand and express yourself coherently, you still need to learn the language.

You also might think that learning a language that is similar to your own would be easier than learning something that is completely foreign to you. Well, at the start it's true, but after some time, when you reach higher levels, you might find yourself in an awkward position of simply forgetting if you just used Czech word or Polish word with changed ending to sound like Czech, you'd be surprised how often I hear my fellow Poles using phrases that are not Czech at all but Polish made to sound like Czech. For me personally, it was much easier learning completely foreign language because you lack those connections and you just have to learn new words by heart, and thusly you remember them easier.

That's all nice and true, but Greece is asking the banks and Europe for money. Period. The alternatives are clear and will cause a much larger drop in welfare of the people, at least in the short run. Be my guest, I like social experiments.

&gt;the devastating social impact of Greece being ""somewhat compliant with standards in vogue in the rest of the world"" 

Go ahead and default, how will that be better for the Greeks?

&gt;the hollow argument that if the austerity measures are not implemented Greece faces economic disaster.

I never said that: the economic disaster has long happened, at the time the Greeks and the banks signed loans that weren't going to be paid back. The EU has arranged that the banks have to swallow 70% of the bad decision, the Greeks 30%: it's up to the Greeks to decide how exactly and how to distribute the burden internally.

&gt;an unelected, undemocratic, technocratic government

Governments never are elected, but all the coalition parties are. That doesn't mean they aren't undemocratic etc, but the fact of the matter is that the Greeks also were pleased with the situation and voted to keep the corrupt party that was going on for decades already going on a bit longer. Understandable, but claiming they are nothing but peons of their evil overlords is ridiculous.

&gt;then why is there no political will to seize this money? The debt would be paid of today!!

Because it's difficult in practice. It would be very easy for a politician to promise that.

Announcer: She got enough Xs; she will now move on to the next stage.

Guy on left:  That was great.  Just a quick question:  Are you Bilingual?

M: No haha

GoL: No?  You don't speak English at all?

M: No, but even still I know a bit from the song

GoL: Really?  Because you have very good diction and pronunciation, in addition to singing skill.

And some were bribed, some participated, some were actively opposing it.   As far as corruption is concerned, you need to bribe to get a driver's license. Sot it's really corrupt. 

Europe's fault lies in delivering the wrong medicine for the wrong causes.  It pushes neo-liberalism as a cure all. It does nothing for stomping corruption and nepotism. It punishes the least responsible for this mess the most. 

I've left Greece years ago, but imagine being a young Greek now. Your country is the sick man of Europe once more, and the ones responsible for it the sickness are the one least affected by it.  You acknowledge the faults of your own society, but there's someone beating the living hell out of you. What exactly are you supposed to do ?  If you don't accept the wrong medicine they'll tell you'll die, if you don't get any medicine at all you might die as well.

So, in my view, this leaves two choices. Either hope that the doctor changes (it might happen) or try to find a cure by yourself.  Chances are however you'll die. 

What deeply annoys me about moralising on the issue is that in your example, is the 200KG chainsmoking man is dying, and you've put him in a hospital telling him to run so he can lose weight. He gets one heart attack after the other, he's condition gets' worse, the doctors can see it but they are not that interested in fixing the problem rather than yelling at him ""die fatso"".

On the other hand, the banks in Cyprus have invested A LOT of money in Greece (in some cases more money than they invested in their own country -- and I believe the reason they aren't discussing this aspect so much is because there will be a public outrage about it), therefore a Greek default for example is not something they actually want to see happen (ie, if they were publicly recommending that greece should leave the eurozone, they would be harming themselves as a creditor).

When you look at this thing that apparently passed in the european parliament at this time as well: http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/euro-parliament-calls-return-varosha/20120215

It just seems like it came out of nowhere at the same time when there are real articles being published in the country about how Greece may not be someone we would want to have in our community from the european perspective.

At the end of the day my stance is that Greece is in need and they deserve our help, simply because I know that if the tables were reversed they would also help. They are definitely making it hard to help them but I believe it's the greek politicians who have caused all of this mess. It seems entirely possible that they have been lying to the people and misusing the previous bailout funds etc which is probably why there is such public outrage right now in Greece about the EU forcing them to take more cuts.

It just seems a bit worrying to me that all of a sudden, Cyprus got something voted in their favour randomly in the parliament and the media has released this information regarding a highly respected european businessman who doesn't screw around recommending that Greece is kicked out.

You may consider Cyprus to be a crappy insignificant country, but you also need to remember that it's a eurozone member and net contributor to the EU which has strong ties to Greece. It seems worrying to me that all of a sudden people are being given information to convince them that it may be time to let go of Greece.

I guess in a way there was also a positive aspect to what the CEO said -- he talked about helping them start back up with their own currency.

Is this just another tactic to add pressure on Greece to give them the guarantees they need for the bailout? -- or are they preparing to cut them lose?",0,1329335774,null,0,false,0,c3rkal0,t3_pr3by,t1_c3rkal0,t3_pr3by,null,1428359692,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

He gets one heart attack after the other, he's condition gets' worse, the doctors can see it but they are not that interested in fixing the problem rather than yelling at him ""die fatso""


Well, perhaps my example was wrong then, because that was not the image I was trying to convey and I apologize. What I meant is, that you do not become a 200 kg chainsmoker without knowing about it, I mean, you *know* that you are at high risk for a heart attack, and you still keep on smoking/eating.

Greece has been borrowing money since, well forever, budget deficit, large shadow economy, corrupted, tax evasion, problem after problem etc. One has to know, at some level, that this is wrong and it can't go on. How can one then be surprised that it collapse, or claim (as in the OP:s case) that everything is Germany's fault? That is what I was trying to say with my example, our fat man can't be surprised when his heart fails or blame it on someone else for that matter. 



&gt;You acknowledge the faults of your own society, but there's someone beating the living hell out of you. What exactly are you supposed to do ? If you don't accept the wrong medicine they'll tell you'll die, if you don't get any medicine at all you might die as well.


Some of the medicine is wrong, but some isn't. It is hard to grow an economy when a) they don't really have much that they produce b) when you are cutting wages c) low productivity. I don't think all of the austerity measures is helping, something making it worse, but what should they do - ask for more money from their voters?

But, some of it is just because you really had it easy before. One of the earliest retirement age, pension based on the most productive five years, no property tax (not really much of taxes at all), retire after 30 (or was it 25)years for 14 % of the workforce, a  lot of people (700 000) working for the government (and apparently doing nothing). Half of them should have been fired years ago, as it seems. Are those things suppose to stay? It's hard to defend to the rest of the EU that they have to send money and pay more taxes, so the Greeks can keep that way of life. Pensions has to be realistic. So does salaries and spending in general. 

But I agree with you. I'd love to see every Greek tax evader get a big fat bill and I'd like to know where every single EU euro has gone. Also, anyone who corrupt should be jailed, which seems like most of the parlament and government workers and many many more.. Doubt if the EU is going for that though, they are more likely to just drop Greece, unfortunately.

I think that is because the EU lacks a real polis, an interconnected conversant electorate with relatively consistent opinions, who are going to hold its political institutions to account. Rather than a national parliament operating within a reasonably united society with an active media, Europe operates in the sunlit upgrounds away from real public scrutiny, as a kind of mish mash of centralized technocracy and national diplomacy. So although the fundamental ideas are good, everything has a tendency to drift, and/or get stuck in illogical compromises.

Part of that is a generational ignorance about the role of the EU (you could certainly say that in Britain), but part of it is also that Europeans are not able to move to other countries, get jobs, marry, have children, and become interconnected, or share the same media, to the same extent as people do in other functional nation states, because of the diversity of language.

&gt; that you do not become a 200 kg chainsmoker without knowing about it,

It was widely known. I wasn't surprised (and I think many people weren't either). But not because Greece was some kind of a socialist paradise. Greece was horrible for a large percentage of the population before the bailouts, it's even more horrible for the same percentage after the bailouts. So while an 1% was making the big bucks, 20% was being bribed to vote for them and another 10% was implicated one way or another, there was (and is) rampant slave like conditions in the private sector (not just for Greeks, but for immigrants as well), which EU policies are making worse. And while the media is sensionalising about how good public sector employees had it, nobody bothers checking the other side of the fence, how horrible private sectors employees are treated. 

Concerning now foreign corporations, their behaviour in Greece was the same as in every third world country. They saw poor idiots ready to be bribed and exploited.  The fact that lot's of people were willing to accept bribes does not make it right.

Who exactly ?

That was a photo taken during a protest. Not only is it blown out of proportion but the person next to the policeman wasn't proved to be a rioter. Also rioter =/= protester. Huge difference, right?

Being from southern California originally, we always debated what would happen if we annexed Mexico or Mexican states. Mexicans in California do pretty well, so the logic would be that we could clean up Mexican states pretty well under US administration.

Greece is the prime example of why that won't work. What incentive does Greece really have to clean itself up? More indebtedness?

I don't think it will happen, but Greece should default, leave the EU and everyone goes back to square one. Greece gets relief, the EU learns a valuable lesson and goes back to the drawing board for new treaties to deal with dead weight in the future.

I remember when the EU came to be, one of the arguments was how Greeks would be currency rich within a year because of the drachma being so valueless compared to other European currencies, but then would fail due to inflation.

If they go bankrupt and revert to a weaker currency? That will work. But they can't borrow in Euros, leave the EU and then pay it back in weak drachmas. ",0,1329342423,null,0,false,0,c3rloy6,t3_pr3by,t1_c3rloy6,t3_pr3by,null,1428360351,-7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-7

as far as why they're doing as well or not as well as they are, i think it's down to Barça being in a time of transition, incorporating Cesc/Alexis/Tello/Cuenca and developing different tactics, as well as their injury issues. as for RM, it's due to the greater cohesion and confidence  and trust gained after a year of playing together, as well as the desire and hunger to win after 3-4 years of being dominated.

First, let me apologise that I do not have time to read all your arguments but I'll try and focus on your links.

Secondly, let me try to defuse the situation first: http://9gag.com/gag/2681884 [ps: I'm not this guy]

Note it says it clearly: don't trust the media

Back to your links:  
[1]. We do not have a functioning state because the politicians were employing incompetent people in exchange of votes. Yes, none of these incompetent people ever complained before the crisis and that is indeed our fault.

[2]. I wonder how can somebody estimate the ""shadow"" economy but anyway, that figure surely includes economic activity conducted by immigrants. (not that I mind them, I'm just noticing it)
Also not that the figure for the US is 9% so it's either there are three times more criminals in GR than the US or the Authorities in the US are three times more effective than in GR. Now, go back to square one: incompetent public workers are employed in exchange of votes.

[3] Oh dear, this argument again. Ok, let's start by the article. It says:

&gt; More than six in 10 taxpayers earn less than 12,000 euros per year and are not required to pay income taxes under the Greek tax system.

So, I hope you don't mean that the lowest incomes should pay taxes and I move on arguing; it is impossible to tax-evade in Greece if you are a salaried employee in a legally-operating company. 

Yes there are many companies who don't operate legally but these are mainly SMEs, shops and cafes - low pay jobs - and they operate without registering or insuring their employees. As you would imagine, people working there really need their job and they cannot complain about the situation. So, whose fault is that? The average person's or the richer boss? 

Another popular way to tax-evade is to own and rent property, while not declaring the income. In this case the tenant is at fault for not reporting it but if they do they'll probably be kicked off soon. However, it's not the tenant who is tax-evading so they are not in this statistic. The person who is tax-evading is a certainly above average multiple property-owner who is not declaring their income.

So, 6/10 are tax evading. How many of them can do something about it without losing their job or their tenancy and how many of them are rich compared to how many are average? My guess is: very few of the average population tax evades.

I appreciate that these property and SME owners are not 1% but they are certainly above average. 

Another popular-in-the-media method to fish this statistic is by looking at the legal definition of ""tax evasion"" in Greece. Did you know that *every* foreign tourist who has visited Greece has tax-evaded? That is because: buying something without asking for a receipt is, legally, tax-evasion. Some media outlets took this statistic and declared Greeks as Tax-evaders.

Now, let me dwell on this issue for a bit more: I strongly believe that in every large enough group of people there is a percentage of them who are criminals. That percentage cannot deviate too much from a bell curve. Therefore it is just absurd to think that 60% of Greeks are tax-evaders while it's only 1-10% in other countries. It just happened that the media targeted Greece as tax evasion heaven but what would have happened if they hard targeted the UK as a social benefit paradise or Germany as a bribe-owned country? I'll let you guess.

[4] We have almost no in-job or job-seeker benefits compared to other countries. The worker's rights and benefits are almost always related with retirement age and pension value. Yes, we're treated better than in other countries after we retire, but we're much worse while actively in a career. Also, these are measures pushed, again, by the politicians and the union leaders who keep paralysing the country with illegal strikes. (by the way, union leaders are definitely rich and highly political as well)

[5] Of course, there is 30% unemployment in Greece and 50% for the young. What did you expect if there is no growth? Also, like in every other European country, we have serious problems managing the ageing population but because of the hardships of the last 30-40 years we don't have enough workers (then children) to cover it up. This is the result of a very complicated process, it's not fair to just flash it to me!

[7] Again, corruption is done by the rich. Why? Because they get rich through corruption and they stay rich and corrupted, high-ranking public employees. But again though, these are not 1%, certainly not average though.

My 1% rant was mostly against politicians and those who benefit from Greece being a sleeping nation.",0,1329345773,null,0,false,0,c3rmd9o,t3_pp0qq,t1_c3rmd9o,t1_c3rfke9,null,1428360677,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

""In the sense of this last ominous question we must how discuss how the influence of Socrates has spread out over later worlds, right up to the present and even into all future ages, like a constantly growing shadow in the evening sun, and how that influence always makes necessary the re-creation of art (I mean art in its most profound and widest metaphysical sense) and through its own immortality guarantees the immortality of art. For this fact to be acknowledged, before it was established that all art inherently depended on the Greeks, from Homer right up to Socrates, we had to deal with these Greeks as the Athenians dealt with Socrates. Almost every age and cultural stage has at some time or another sought in an ill-tempered frame of mind to free itself of the Greeks, because in comparison with the Greeks, all their achievements, apparently fully original and admired in all sincerity, suddenly appeared to lose their colour and life and were reduced to unsuccessful copies, even caricatures.

And so a heartfelt inner anger constantly kept breaking out against that arrogant little nation which dared throughout time to define everything that was not produced in its own country as “barbaric” Who were these Greeks, people asked themselves, who had achieved only an ephemeral historical glitter, only ridiculously restricted institutions, only an ambiguous competence in morality, who could even be identified with hateful vices, yet who had nevertheless taken a pre-eminent place among nations for their value and special importance, something fitted for a genius among the masses? Unfortunately people were not lucky enough to find the cup of hemlock which can do away with such a being, for all the poisons they created—envy, slander, and inner anger—were insufficient to destroy that self-satisfied magnificence.

Hence, confronted by the Greeks, people have been ashamed and afraid. It seems that an individual who values the truth above everything else might dare to propose as true the notion that the Greeks drive the chariot of our culture and every other one, but that almost always the wagon and the horses are inferior material and cannot match the glory of their drivers, who then consider it funny to whip such a team into the abyss, over which they themselves jump with a leap worthy of Achilles.""

EDIT: I have to LOL at the downvotes here. This is what happens when people think with their hearts, not their heads. Yes, completely defaulting would be much better for Greece's credit rating than actually discharging the debt. 

Back in my sales days, one of my biggest customers was the US gov't. Of all the corporate and gov't clients we had, no one had a better credit rating than the US gov't. It was guaranteed they would pay, and they did. If there were interest to pay, they would get the lowest rate. 

Also, if you have a good credit rating, your bonds are secure, which allow you to borrow money or attract investors for public works projects.

&gt; More than six in 10 taxpayers earn less than 12,000 euros per year and are not required to pay income taxes under the Greek tax system.
So, I hope you don't mean that the lowest incomes should pay taxes and I move on arguing; it is impossible to tax-evade in Greece if you are a salaried employee in a legally-operating company. 


Yes, I certainly do. In my country, who has just contributed a lot of money to bailout/Eurozone  we start paying at € 1100. One pay it percentagewise, not absolute numbers. It is rather high if you compare it to other European  countries to start at €12 000. Why should you start to pay taxes later than us? I am a low income student, should I pay taxes so you do not have to?


&gt;I wonder how can somebody estimate the ""shadow"" economy but anyway, that figure surely includes economic activity conducted by immigrants. (not that I mind them, I'm just noticing it)

Of course, no one has the perfect number but it's done quite frequently, and accurately for a number of countries (including my own). So, the number is probably around correct.This number didn't come out of nowwhere. You are not the only country with immigrants and small cafés, but most countries tries to lessen it - it seems Greece do not. Why haven't you protested about this before? Because it suited everyone, not just the rich.



&gt;Yes there are many companies who don't operate legally but these are mainly SMEs, shops and cafes - low pay jobs - and they operate without registering or insuring their employees. As you would imagine, people working there really need their job and they cannot complain about the situation.


Again, you didn't complain about this a few years ago when business was booming and the waitress could have found a new job, the small café shop was quite comfortably off bribing someone. The shadow economy didn't grow out of nowhere in the last year - you have sustained it and refused to deal with it for years. A lot of countries have small business and cafés, unemployment and are trying to survive - that is not a reason to cheat and to be corrupt. Iceland had a hell of a ride, they are not very corrupt for example. Greece is very low on the corruption  list for a reason - the politicians, the rich and yes, the ordinary Greeks haven't dealt with it.  



&gt;Also, like in every other European country, we have serious problems managing the ageing population but because of the hardships of the last 30-40 years we don't have enough workers (then children) to cover it up. This is the result of a very complicated process, it's not fair to just flash it to me!


What, not being fair? If I point out correct fatcts, I am being unfair?  You said it was all other countries and the 1 %  fault that Greece is in trouble(which I am happy to notice you do not do in your post anymore, I was going to comment on that later) and I pointed out that no other country has constructed your pension plans, where you retired earlier with more of your salary than other OECD countries  - you voted for that, we didn't. I might add that those pension plans benefited more than your 1 %. You have corrctly stated that you have an aging population (as many other countries). So why an overly generously pension plan? Didn't you know you had an aging population before 2010? I know you are starting to change that, but it is only because you have been forced. Of course unsustainable pension plans contributed to Greece's downfall. Btw, we have 67, and it's being talked about raising it, so it was  chocking for me when the Greeks protested retiring at 65. 



&gt;Now, let me dwell on this issue for a bit more: I strongly believe that in every large enough group of people there is a percentage of them who are criminals. That percentage cannot deviate too much from a bell curve. Therefore it is just absurd to think that 60% of Greeks are tax-evaders while it's only 1-10% in other countries. It just happened that the media targeted Greece as tax evasion heaven but what would have happened if they hard targeted the UK as a social benefit paradise or Germany as a bribe-owned country? I'll let you guess


I don't believe most of the Greeks are hard core criminals if that is what you ask, but if you throw out statistic, please back it up with reports or articles.  What I believe is that it is so common to bribe people/evade taxes that everyone got used to it and  didn't really see it as a crime. A fellow countryman of yours stated in this thread that Greece was ripe with corruption and nepotism, and that one had to bribe to get a drivers license for example. So, how many drivers instructors has gotten fired? That is what I mean with that it's everywhere. Anecdotal yes, but you do not get to number 80 on the corruption list without in being a fixture in society. 



I can understand that it's not fun being (a young) Greek at the moment and from what I understand is one of the reasons that although  a lot of people has contributed to bringing Greece to where it is now, it seems like only the lower and the middle class is paying the price for it. Fine, be angry with them, I certainly wouldn't mind if every tax evader and corrupt person in Greece was thrown in jail. What I was originally opposed to however was that you claimed that it was only because of them, or only because of the foreigners, or that you had unique hardships throughout history that made you do it - I do not believe that, and I am very happy that you have taken the time to explain your posting a bit more and not mentioned that again. 

Ultimately, the only ones who can change Greece is the Greeks and to do that one has the change what is wrong. The upper class certainly has behave like bastards, the banks are no angels but my point that  all of Greek society has contributed to that, not just them, although not all are paying the price.

- Start at *Potsdamer Platz* (see the *Sony Centre*, not much else to do here except for a visitors platform on top of kollhoff tower), from there walk towards *Brandenburg Gate* via Ebertstr., on the way you will find the 
- *Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe* on the right, from Brandenburg Gate, take Simsonweg through that tiny northeast part of *Tiergarten* to the *Reichstag*, walk back to the 
- *Brandenburg Gate*, walk across *Pariser Platz*, then walk along *Unter den Linden* towards Alexanderplatz, on the way you will find 
- *Friedrichstraße* (shopping to the north, *Checkpoint Charlie* to the south), here you  take a right turn into Friedrichstraße, walk past the VW showroom (there's a couple of Bentleys and a Bugatti Veyron in the windows, if you're into that sort of thing) and past the *Galeries Lafayette*, then take a left after Galeries Lafayette, you are now walking straight towards
- *Gendarmenmarkt*, with it's twin churches and a beautiful theatre. From there, walk north on Markgrafenstr., at its end, take a right, then you have 
- *Bebelplatz* to your left, which has a very powerful memorial in remembrance of the bookburnings of the third reich in its centre (look for the window in the floor), the *Deutsche Staatsoper*, a beautiful old library and a domed cathedral. Walk across Unter den Linden towards the 
- main building of the *Humboldt University*, to its right you will find
- *Neue Wache*, a memorial to the Victims of war and tyranny, walk further east on Unter den Linden, across the river, and you're on 
- *museum island*, there's the *Lustgarten* to your left, with the *Altes Museum* and the *Berlin cathedral*. Now, there's much more to the Museumsinsel, so you should seriously consider walking along Am Zeughaus and Am Kupfergraben (before you cross the river to Museum Island), so you can see the *Pergamonmuseum* and the *Bodemuseum*, cross the river via Monbijou bridge by the Bode, go south by the water, take the next bridge onto museum island, see the *Alte Nationalgallerie* and the just recently rebuilt *Neues Museum*, you'll easily find your way back to Unter den Linden, where you go east off museum island, there's the Radisson Blu to your left, which has 
- the *world's largest cylindrical fishtank* in it's lobby (25 meters high, 12m diameter), from there it's just a quick walk to the
- *Fernsehturm*, Berlin's most prominent landmark.

This concludes our tour, I hope you've enjoyed your trip and you will recommend DudeTours to your friends.

All in all, this should be about 5-7km, which, depending on how long you want to spend at each sight, of course, should not take you longer than three or four hours, and it should be very easy for you to retrace my steps on google maps so you can be prepared when you get there. This trip will allow you to see a lot of the more remarkable and historic architecture Berlin has to offer, and has most of Mitte's main sights covered.

&gt; (In Italian) I'd like to refer to an article published in the French, German and Italian press this morning...We're not doing very well at the moment, but we need to reconcile integration, which we need more and more of, and democracy, which we of course don't want to give up. (Switches to English) So how do you reconcile democracy with integration? Of course integration (applause). Of course, of course, only a deeply superficial, insular culture might consider that (applause punctuated by heckling) might naively consider that integration means  a super-state. (Presumably some heckle about who he was elected by, in response) ... a vast majority of the Italian parliament. (Switches back to Italian) President, excuse me if I'm taken by the passion for European integration. (Some people very pleased, others angry, others mildly bewildered). Integration does absolutely not mean a superstate, but the continuation of the principle of subsidiarity, and it must of course be reconciled with democracy. And we can see what happens today if people in some member states get the impression that the integration is happening to the detriment of democracy. (Reference to the Greek riots I suppose. Goes on to talk about the EP as a democratic body).

Not sure why I typed all that out. Not very much in it. Although I'd argue that using the word culture makes it seem a bit like an attack on Britain in general rather than just UKIP. Ironic that Dr  (Prof?) Monti would switch into English and then make a linguistic mis-step like that. Although perhaps it was in response to heckling earlier, and the context would be more clear if you were there.

I didn't understand a lot of it, so I don't really know what I was supposed to be hearing. So I'll reserve my judgement for a later point in time when I have more information available to me.

Wouldn't it be nice if external parties (e.g. not the uploader) could submit 'draft' translations/subtitles? How hard would it be if such a service was tied to a Google+ account, and perhaps could be 'crowdsourced' like Wikipedia? It would suffer the same drawbacks as Wikipedia (vulnerable to misinformation and bad edits), but as Wikipedia is *somewhat* reliable, what would stand in the way of having such functionality on YouTube? One could always set a flag to ""disable external subtitles"" or ""make the uploader accept and review before publishing"". Even if the uploader wouldn't speak the language of the subtitles, this other service *coughGoogleTranslatecough* could indicate whether or not said subtitles would match with what was being said. So the uploader could have as much control over the quality as he likes.

Actually, I'm pretty sure neither is technically possible, but simply cutting off funding would have the same effect. Without the bailouts, Greece would have to reintroduce the drachma to at least domestically have a resemblance of solvency.  
There is no exit mechanism for the Eurozone but to exit the EU altogether, and there are other reasons why this would be necessary in such a situation. Imagine you're Greek (or have assets in Greece), and you hear (and believe) a rumor that they've started to print new drachmas. What do you do? You try to beat the others to the bank, to get as much cash in hand as possible, and you transfer everything you can to an account in the core countries. You liquidate all your other assets, at a loss if you have to, and move them abroad. Then you pack your family and remaining stuff and start a new life elsewhere. All this is already going on, to a certain degree. Greece can't let this happen, and they'll have to break several essential EU treaties to prevent it.

The very first step in a return to the drachma would be capital controls. No more international bank transfers, all cash withdrawn from your bank account would have a stamp that crossed out the word ""euro"" and said ""drachma"" in big bright red letters, to later be replaced with new bills. It's very likely that they would search you for euro cash and possibly valuables if you wanted to leave the country. Greece would begin to collect duties on a range of products, especially luxury and consumer goods, and on products that can be produced locally.

Now, the flaw obviously lies in the population size, since that's not a constant. But I think it's still kinda interesting.

true,radaway,PORT,Portugal,"&gt; what if the reforms you are being asked to do is to commit suicide ?

The reforms will be done either you want to or not because either way there is no more money for the structure you had in place. What the money we are getting now does is buy time to do them a little slower.  
  
I know we need better deals, seriously, there's no way we won't default with the current one. All I'm saying is that I can understand the countries helping us need reassurances that we are, and will continue to, changing our path; before they give us a better deal. It's a matter of trust, we need to regain it. It's basic moral hazard.  
  
&gt; What if you have an unelected Prime Minister ? What if EU is currently doing it's best to delay elections ?  
  
I don't know what to say to this, it's a shitty situation. Still your prime minister has the support of the majority of your parliament so it's not like he is operating illegitimately.  
  
&gt; What if nobody wanted the bailouts in the first place ?  
  
I did agree with indirectapproach2 that elections would be a very good idea, the sooner the better. I know we probably would be having the same problems if we didn't have elections like Ireland did.  So elect someone that will not take the bailout route, and good luck with that (honestly).  
  
It might even be good for us, because, if you guys take that route, Europe will want to firewall the rest and will probably give us a much much better deal than we have right now.

Their sound is definitely disco-ish, pop-ish with a lot of 80s synth in it. Not trashy, dirty or clashy like the ones from Justice. Also, we all know daft punk for their heavy and distorted sound, but around the world is not a banger sound, and something about us is clearly funky rather than electro per your definition.
The thing is, what I've noticed with many french electro artist, and again I'm not just talking about french people, is that the groove is something very important in the sound. No matter what it has to be funky and has a great vibe to it. That's how I qualify frenchelectro, nice melody, great groove, funky bass, 80s moroder feeling for the main part. But also nice crafted breaks, ultra layered kicks and snares with some heavy sidechain compression in it. It can be banger like Justice or simply soulful like breakbot, in my mind they both qualify for frenchelectro. And that's what this reddit is about.

EDIT: perfect example is [this track](http://soundcloud.com/dilemn/dilemn-modern-slave) from Dilemn. It starts very slow, with some nu-disco vibe, then progresses to a more dance-floor tune with some slight hints of distorted sound, until it reaches its full dirty ed banger tone! Dilemn chose to put all the styles, all the influences of french electro in this track.

There is not much. You pay bottom-level wages, and the local mafia enforces them. It's a win-win situation for the investor and local gangsters. 

Dropping the wages even further (something that even the Greek union of industrialists was against) guarantees further recession, as none has any money to buy anything. Thus, the GDP will go lower again, etc, in death spiral to the bottom.

A simple sandwich costs 3 euros, a midday snack ('tyropita' - cheese pie) costs 1.50, gas costs 1.70 per litre. Simply commuting to work will cost you more than 3 euros per day in gas alone, i.e. about 90 euros per month. That's a minimum. On top of that, (obligatory) car insurance costs about 40 euros per month. On top of that, you also have to pay a special tax for cars, starting from about 10 euros per month, depending on the car. That's 150 euros per month *just* for the privilege of having a car and using it to go to work (nowhere else). Scraping it and taking the bus won't be much cheaper, either.

Food will cost you about 200 euros per month for a single person and of course you will have to cook everything at home (eating out once in a while at a cost of 10-15 euros per person is a luxury with this wage). Rent comes at a minimum of another 300 euros per month. Factor in electricity, water and telephone bills.

I have no problems with people doing in their bedrooms whatever they want, it is the kind of loudly attracting attention which is the characteristic of American gays is what bothers me. Also, I am Eastern European, we tend to be more conservative in these things than WE. But even in WE you typically don't really see very ""flaming"" looking people riding the subway in morning commute time the same way as in NY or SF. They tend to keep their things more to themselves which is I think the way things should be. There seems to be a general unspoken agreement that people don't hate on gays, in return they don't try to attract much attention. 

In other words, tolerance means that given that other people have a say in public matters but not in private matters, sexuality is then considered private, hence others have no say in it, and the flip side of it that then really keep it private then, don't really flaunt it too much in the public. (Except for the Gay Pride day, which is when all the suppressed attention-whoring comes out for a day.)

Mind you, this attention-whoring I think is a general American trait, not just a gay one. Even the opposite side, like e.g. conservatives do this, I mean these t-shirts of the ""peace through superior firepower"" type and the Jesus bumper stickers. Or political ones. Why do people feel the need they must advertise their views and push it onto others?

* No more loans. No. More. Loans. The debt must be frozen and be repaid at a later time. This will be best for everybody. Also, a full disclosure of what Greece owes and to whom, when was that money borrowed and by whom, where did it end and *most importantly* how much of the money that is owed is capital and how much is interest. This is very important. People are literally dying here. To what end? Full disclosure. Not only to the Greeks, but to every European people. Let the truth shine and burn those that should be burned, no matter who they are (even if it is me who is at fault).

* A sense of social justice must be restored among Greeks. See my previous [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/lwdls/greek_pm_papandreou_faces_party_revolt_over/c2w6grs) on this matter. Note: this is not optional. As things stand, if the above is not done, it will all end in tears and bloodshed. People are ready to invade and burn down the Parliament. As I said in my older post, it is not a matter of choosing financial option A vs. financial option B.

* Cuts must be made. But not the easy, lets-take-money-away-from-the-poor kind of cuts. The hard, lets-take-money-away-from-the-elite kind.

* As things are winding down and sanity is restored, Greece must slowly start producing again (instead of blindly consuming German goods, fueled by German loans - and I'm writing this reluctantly since I want to fully respect this subreddit's guidelines and keep my personal opinions to myself).

&gt;No more loans


Imagine everyone agrees to freeze all debt and interest payments on it for an indeterminate amount of time. Mind you, that is not how it works... this scenario is called ""uncontrolled default"".  But imagine it can happen, and all debt is now zero. Then what? Then Greece is STILL diving straight into bankruptcy. Why? Because it STILL spends much more than it actually produces. Greece won't be able to pay for salaries etc in the very next month.


Greece needs to adjust its spending to its production. This is a huge problem, because there has been almost no progress in that area since the crisis started. Not just cuts, like you mentioned in your third bullet point, but a complete reform that takes actual production as the baseline for all economic spending plans.


&gt;A sense of social justice must be restored among Greeks


This is going to be hard to swallow, but: there has been no social injustice done upon the Greeks. This didn't *happen* to the Greeks, it was *caused* by them collectively. It's not the ""1%"" that did this to Greece, it was the 60-70%. This unsustainable system was endorsed and considered normality by an entire nation for decades.


I do agree with your last bullet point. After spending is equalized with production, Greece needs to start growing in a sustainable manner, by building up its production in any way it can.

The power over their lives have slowly been leaking away to a corrupt minority. A minority who rather spent the billions in aid they've received from EU to continue lining their own pockets rather than fix their own system or (god forbid) pay taxes. 

What need to happen is a little revolution. A full restart of the system. A banning of every single politician of ever holding office again and drakonian control of every single remaining bureaucrat (maybe a truth commission in the coming years, hunting down all the bribe takers), the state seizing all the assets of the tax-dodging rich bastards (the back taxes easily exceeds the assets of just about every  single one of them). 

Are the Greeks to blame for anything? Of course they are. It's a democratic country. They've accepted full-blown corruption in their leadership for decades, kept voting for leeches sucking the very lifeblood out of their economy, kept blowing of anyone who warned that they where heading to hell in a hand basket and so on. 

Greeks, every other nation in the EU want you to fix your problem, to get viable as a state again, but we are running out of things we can do. We can't keep giving you money because, lets face it, it'll just drain away in that corrupt system of yours, never doing a shred of good for anyone.  Besides, most of us are in a recession to, extra money is a rare commodity at the moment. We can't change your government by force, that would amount to declaring war on a friendly country, and nobody wants that.

No, what should happen, what needs to happen, is popular revolution. For the power to flow in the direction of the people again. Then, maybe we can help Greece rebuild. ",0,1329404132,null,0,false,0,c3ru0cm,t3_pnbme,t1_c3ru0cm,t3_pnbme,null,1428364356,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,nestoras,GREE,Greece,"&gt; Imagine everyone agrees to freeze all debt and interest payments on it for an indeterminate amount of time. Mind you, that is not how it works... this scenario is called ""uncontrolled default"".

You are talking finances, interest rates and politics. I know how it is called. I even know some legal terms myself, like 'odious debt'. In the end, we are talking about human lives here. With all due respect, I do not think that we are seeing eye to eye here. I can tell you again that there are a lot of people who do not have enough to feed their children. These are the people who are being asked to give back more and more and MOAR!!!1!! by foreign politicians on TV, like Mr. Schauble. Funny thing, they all wear very-very expensive ties.

&gt; But imagine it can happen, and all debt is now zero. Then what? Then Greece is STILL diving straight into bankruptcy. Why? Because it STILL spends much more than it actually produces. Greece won't be able to pay for salaries etc in the very next month.

I agree. Hence, my third point about cutting expenses. The deficit must go to zero, or even better Greece must produce a surplus. Points number 1 and 2 are necessary preconditions for this to happen.  I think that at this point we are spending 108% of what we are producing, or thereabout. This cutback must be swift, but it must also be **fair**. Please understand, any more cuts to the smallest salaries and pensions (the 'easy targets') and people will have nothing to lose any more. Desperate people do desperate things and they *certainly* don't pay back interest. I am sorry that I cannot convey this to you any better. You know what, here's an idea: let's NOT buy those 40 Eurofighters from Germany and France that we must buy as a condition for the loan (wat?).

&gt; This is going to be hard to swallow, but: there has been no social injustice done upon the Greeks. This didn't happen to the Greeks, it was caused by them collectively. It's not the ""1%"" that did this to Greece, it was the 60-70%. This unsustainable system was endorsed and considered normality by an entire nation for decades.

This is a very big discussion, but for now let's just say that I respectfully disagree. The Greek people are certainly not blameless, but your assessment of the percentage of the blame is way off IMHO.

&gt; I do agree with your last bullet point. After spending is equalized with production, Greece needs to start growing in a sustainable manner, by building up its production in any way it can.

I think we can all agree on that. Except for the people who'd rather have their profits from the interest rates right now. And I still can't forget how expensive those ties look.

&gt; Problem is: all this is not going to happen.

tax accountants here are all insane.  they take 6 months minimum to put a few figures on a form and charge €300+ for this.  they may decide simply to not email back the following year because they found it too difficult or took offense that you insisted on politely inquiring after 6 months if they were perhaps finished yet.

you may be required to use a professional tax accountant for residency.  

it sounds like you are not here anymore.  you pay taxes in your country of residency and pay taxes on all income wherever it was earned. I pay German taxes on US income that I did while living here.

so file for your home country, declare the € income and declare foreign taxes paid €300 which will then be subtracted from your taxes owed to your home country.  

if you paid any significant amount into soziale kasse (social security) then you can actually get this back if you've left.

true,nestoras,GREE,Greece,"&gt; Maybe you should not be eating 3 euro sandwiches then?

I don't. Many people don't. Little stores are closing left and right, since in a capitalist system it is very easy to raise prices but very-very hard to bring them back down (the man that provides you with meat for making your sandwiches won't lower *his* prices, not before many of *his* customers have closed shop).

&gt; Bread, meat, butter, tomato and cucumber does not cost more than in Slovakia or Estonia.

Why, yes, yes they do. They do cost more. Their price has doubled and tripled and quadrupled since 1999. Tomatoes are especially expensive at ~1.50 per kg (four tomatoes, the cheapest you can find). Bread is at 1 euro per &lt;350gr. Meat is also very expensive, boneless chicken costs 8 to 10 euros per kg. In short, if you make a sandwich yourself it will of course be cheaper than buying it from a store, but not by much. You can make a nice sandwich for 1.5 to 2 euros maybe. And that's just a sandwich.

But that is not the point. The point is that neither Greece, nor Slovakia or Estonia should have to abide by these conditions.

&gt;  You should look at yourself first if you are upset about your sandwich costing that much.

If only you knew me personally you would understand how funny that sounds when being directed to me (or many other Greeks for that matter).
