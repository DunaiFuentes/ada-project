As for the cultural clashes, obviously the bigger the EU gets, the more voices come into play. For such a big organization to work, there must be the will of the politicians to achieve consensus on difficult issues. That's not always possible, unfortunately.

Sure it's expensive as hell, public transport sucks, it rains all the time and it's filthy but that's London.

London is the most accepting city of foreigners.  That may be why more than 300 languages are spoken there.  It was, after all, started by a bunch of illegal immigrants, from Italy.  

It's contemporary music is the best.

Not only did it produce a once in a generation voice in Amy Winehouse but it's just gone and produced another in Adele.   Yeah, I know Adele is fat but she can sing.

(Nice vid, shot on the Seine no less, methinks.)

London is  just down the road from Glastonbury and the whole of the rest of the English festival scene, which is booming.

You won't be taxed to oblivion to pay for idle self-righteous functioonaries to look down their noses at you.

Sure, you will be heavily taxed but it's worse elsewhere.

The official religion is Church of England - so nothing to worry about.

And the place is crawling with eastern European hotties just desperate to get their hooks into some nice Canuck with some spends.

Flatshare.com is a site that really shifts product.  It's real hard and fast.  It should give you as accurate a picture as you can get without being on the ground.

But be advised, the accommodation scene in London is a catfight.   That's because so many people want to live in London. 

Obviously, you will look at whatever else your own research uncovers.

If you are into the music thing north London may well be better.

There is quite a difference between north of the river and south.

In the broadest possible terms the north tends to be a bit more artistic, musical and drunk and the south a bit more football, football and drunk.

I suppose it's only to be expected since all the great London football teams are north of the river, Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.

Traditionally, the west of the city is quieter and the east edgier.

Of course, this song doesn't come from nowhere,

You're under 30, so you're eligible for the Working Holiday program which allows Canadians to work for 1 year in Belgium.  Here is info on the programme:
http://www.diplomatie.be/montreal/default.asp?id=37&amp;mnu=37

The best general site to find a rental is http://immoweb.be/fr/  

A big thing to know, however is that renting in Belgium is not like renting in Canada.  For one thing, the most common lease is called a 3-6-9, which is essentially a 9-year lease.  You can sign a 1-yr lease, but you must read it very carefully because many landlords try to slip in extra costs assuming you won't read and question it.  

Having said that, I'd highly recommend that you look on the housing section of www.xpats.com to find an apartment and roommates (do not be thrown off by how shitty this website looks... it is an extremely good resource for housing and good, cheap furniture).  Brussels has a large population of young people working for the European Commission and the EU, and a lot of them use this site.  The other place you can look for housing is on the school housing boards, e.g., at ULB.

www.resto.be has a pretty comprehensive list of restaurants in Belgium.  You might want to run a search of restaurants in Brussels that meet the criteria of the place you want to work for and contact them directly.

&gt; Yes, that's an age in which trans people know that they are trans.

Independent scientific studies? The hints thrown in the article say very clearly that most ""trans"" kids eventually become homosexual adults.

When I was 11, I wanted to be a physicist forever. Nowadays, I can't imagine something more boring thatn high-level math with no applications in real life. 11 is not an age where you should have the ability to change your life into a fixed rail.

&gt;&gt; Suicidal tendencies -&gt; instant psychiatry.

&gt; Defiance to death in not the same as suicidal tendencies. If I say ""I'd protect my kid against a mugger to the death"", am I suicidal, then?

There's a difference in motivation. One is ""waiting until you are of age, with no real negative perprecussions, because you cannot have the full picture right now."" It's akin to the kid who throws itself at the ground in the supermarket for not getting ice cream. Your example is a threat/risk assesment based on rational thought.

&gt; Probably in good faith that the Jugenamt wouldn't act without actually assessing the situation.

To me, it appears the Jugendamt did. They got info about a possible negative influence of the mother on the kid, and sent her to a psychiatrist, which after a talk determined that in fact she had manipulated her kid. The fact that this assessment is not exactly what Alex's mom had in mind does not mean the psychiatrist had been manipulated. 

&gt; No psychiatry can prevent a human from committing suicide without a) fixing the actual problem (and that is having her basic rights infringed upon) or b) restraining and/or pumping them full of phychotropics, for life. Is that what you want?

Nobody wants a permanently-sedated person. I disagree that fixing the mental problem does take accepting what she/he believes is her free will. The problem might very well be having been brainwashed into the role she plays. Psychiatrists and psychotherapists are rather good in fixing brainwashing victims.

&gt; There would be no bleeding danger of suicide, in the first place, if the Jugendamt would have its act together and get a proper assessment.

&gt; 11 is not an age where you should have the ability to change your life into a fixed rail.

Read the article, that dutch study, which says that trans kids *claim* to be girls, homosexuals merely *want* to be girls. Assessments that early are possible. Reassignment surgery and hormone treatment is a completely different kind of beast, and, yes, should have to wait.

&gt; One is ""waiting until you are of age, with no real negative perprecussions, because you cannot have the full picture right now.""

What's currently at stake is getting her brainwashed into not being trans and having her suffer through a puberty. The brainwashing part is known to lead to suicide later in life, the suffering through puberty part torturous.

&gt; They got info about a possible negative influence of the mother on the kid, and sent her to a psychiatrist

Quoth the article:

&gt; Alex wurde nie neutral begutachtet. 

""Alex has never been assessed independently"". Stop pulling stuff out of your ass. There was a doctor that talked to both parents and inferred it, it's not mentioned that he even was a psychiatrist. Then the mother visited a therapist, fearing *herself* that she could have an issue, the therapist found nothing.

&gt; The problem might very well be having been brainwashed into the role she plays. Psychiatrists and psychotherapists are rather good in fixing brainwashing victims.

Might, yes, though overall it's unlikely. Still needs to be assessed, which so far didn't happen.

&gt; The one getting accepted by the taz?

One that brings out the truth, and results in a way out that doesn't force Alex into suicide / living her rest of the live as psychotropic vegetable, whether she's trans or not.

Let's start with an initial assessment, puperty inhibitors if being trans can't be reliably ruled out, and constant re-evaluation for continuing to inhibit puperty. She's young enough to have years before the late onset of puberty, and long-term assessment is quite reliable indeed. Should the situation turn out to be bogus, *he*, then, can have a puberty, not later, or much later, than many other boys. But forcing *her* into a male puberty and no pudding if she doesn't like football is torture.

The southern economies aren't less fortunate, they are less competitive in the global economy, too rigid and inflexible, and too dependant on few key sectors of their economies, that is why they are in trouble right now. Germany could also be in trouble, but what Germany did in the beginning of 00s were reforms to their economy that allowed their economy and companies to function and compete better in the global market.

I would also like to point out that the success of Germany is not due to Euro, it is not due to its southern neighbours fairing less well, it is providing the market was the market wants. In the case of Germany that is exporting tools and machinery to developing world like the BRIC countries. In case of southern countries, like for example Italy, their traditional industries like textile and clothing had time to prepare to globalization of trade and competition, but they didn't act and invest, and neither did the Italian government.

And if we go to redistribution of resources between different areas, that isn't possible if there isn't any common policy including labour and social legislation, any common rules on government spending etc...

1. Doesn't matter. Oil and gas that run economies cost more with less valuable currency. Also many German companies produce products and services that can't be replaced, they will be bought at almost whatever price. Secondly German companies are global, they reorganize their production chains, in essence relocate parts of their manufacturing to places with lower human costs, like their eastern neighbours.

2. Low yielding debt doesn't obligate countries to borrow more money, that is purely political decision in a state level and a business decision on bank level. If states, banks, companies and individuals have made bad decision then there are consequences including bankruptcy and lower standards of living at least for a while.


In my honest opinion the problem in southern countries is that people are holding back on changes and thus necessary changes aren't being made to the economy. For example in Spain what would be needed is US kind of personal bankruptcy laws that would allow indebted persons to go bankrupt and then allow them to rebuild their lives from a clean table. Yes, many banks could go bankrupt, but if people can't reboot their lives, then the whole economy will suffer greatly before things get better. 

Not to mention that state bureaucracy in a place like Greece should be wiped out completely, if the people don't want to or can't pay for their state services, then the state should offer only bare minimum amount of services that people are willing to pay. Again this would cause great deal of pain for people working for the state, but then again, they would employ themselves sooner or later by people buying their services directly from them. Again law like the US personal bankruptcy is needed, also what is needed is removal of many labour restrictions and allowing free at will hiring of people. Again, great pains, but it would allow people and companies to try, hire somebody, if it works, great, if not then that is too bad, but at least it was tried.

One of our biggest problems is the existence of the two party system. The modern Republican Party is ideologically not far removed from many European neo-fascist parties such as France's Front National, and the vast majority of the Democratic Party would be considered right of center in Europe. Because of cultural and institutional barriers, the vast majority of voters think of every issue in black and white terms, with two opposing views. Yet another problem with being a superpower is the nonsensical nationalist sentiment that permeates throughout all aspects of society. The Republican Presidential candidates are vying for votes in the Republican primaries, which is comprised of the more hardcore ideologues, who are far more likely to vote, and are incredibly nationalist. They make statements that appeal to them in order to win the nomination so that they can go on to the general election.

true,CountVonTroll,null,null,"Both Frankfurt and Düsseldorf are very expensive. Among the larger cities, Leipzig offers the most bang for the buck, and there you could make do with $2000/month -- but barely. Think temporary adventure, not long term plan. Keep in mind that if you live in Germany, you need to pay German taxes, that having health insurance is mandatory, and if it was long term you'd have to think about retirement savings as well. There's also the ""risk"" that the euro recovers and eventually gains vs. the dollar.

Another thing to consider is that you can't just fly to Europe, rent an apartment and set up a life there. Imagine a Mexican trying that in the US. That he's working for a Mexican company remotely doesn't mean anything. Why would you think it's different when you're the immigrant elsewhere?

What you could do would be to find a room in a shared apartment to live there temporarily. Students often go live somewhere else, either on an exchange or just work or an extended vacation, and want to move back into their old room when they return. So, they look for somebody to pay the rent while they're gone, without wanting to move in long-term.

* Budget for 10€ at least for food each day, closer 20€ if you'll be eating out (e.g. buying take-away, going out to lunch at work).

* Landlords typically wish to see net income which is triple of what you will pay for accommodation. I'm not saying you cannot survive on less, I am saying that it looks better this way.

* Public health insurance comes out of your gross here. Will you be privately insured or will you become a member of the public health insurance system? (This severely affects cost and coverage.)

* How will you pay for the move? A transatlantic move could set you back several months' salary.

I am assuming the 2k$ are your net income which at the current exchange rate translates to 1.5k€. 

Yes, you can live on that in Germany without worries. Note that not all big cities are necessarily more expensive. Munich, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt and Hamburg are. Berlin, e.g., is not.

La diferencia de acento en toda Andalucía se remonta a los tiempos de La Reconquista; *Andalucía* proviene de *Al-Andalus* y fueron los últimos territorios en ser reconquistados por los reinos cristianos. Por esta razón el acento andaluz es tan diferente y recuerda levemente al árabe.

**Bonus:** tras el descubrimiento de América los españoles establecieron puertos situados en Andalucía como base para sus viajes de conquista. Por ello la gran mayoría de colonos y conquistadores tenían origen andaluz y del sur de España... Y por eso hoy en día los habitantes de la América del Sur y Central hispanohablante mantienen características similares al acento andaluz, como el seseo.

D'une part parce qu'éviter ces répétitions en déployant un vocabulaire plus riche est apprécié, et d'autre part parce que l'on fait beaucoup usage de procédés [métonymiques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy).

Dans le même registre, on a gardé le terme de ""péninsule ibérique"" (espagne+portugal), et plus rarement le terme de 'ibère' pour désigner un espagnol (ou encore 'germain' pour un allemand).

Quant à l'aspect chauvin: il existe, mais pas nécessairement sur un mode péjoratif; il faut prendre en compte le contexte. Parfois l'ambiguité est parfaitement voulue. La phrase ""nos amis anglo-saxons"" peut parfaitement être vraiment amicale (dans le cadre d'un match de Rugby par ex.), ou au contraire sous-entendre (par antiphrase) que ""le concurrence étrangère qu'il faut vaincre sous peine de perdre notre identité"", ou quelque chose de cet ordre.

L'exemple de ""enseignement en anglo-saxon"" que tu rapportes me parait simplement être une façon très maladroite de dire ""anglais international"".

Une autre explication possible est que souvent ""anglo-saxon"" désigne en réalité spécifiquement ce qui est américain. Il s'agit dans ce cas d'éviter d'utiliser ""américain"" à cause des sentiments partagés qu'ont les gens vis-à-vis des USA: anti-américanisme primaire (comme on l'appelle ici), mais aussi ""ringardisation"" (c'est à dire ""devenu ringard, passé de mode"": admirer les USA était à la mode dans les années 60-80, mais maintenant on se doit d'avoir au moins un point de vue critique sur ""l'amérique"").",0,1328207477,null,0,false,0,c3n8n63,t3_p7t3j,t1_c3n8n63,t3_p7t3j,null,1428284694,4,false,france,t5_2qhjz,4

""Intersex, in humans and other animals, is the presence of intermediate or atypical combinations of physical features that usually distinguish female from male. This is usually understood to be congenital, involving chromosomal, morphologic, genital and/or gonadal anomalies, such as diversion from typical XX-female or XY-male presentations, e.g., sex reversal (XY-female, XX-male), genital ambiguity, or sex developmental differences. An intersex individual may have biological characteristics of both the male and the female sexes.""

Aspects of fascism exist in nearly every country on Earth, as well as aspects of communism, liberalism etc. There are no countries that follow pure political ideologies. I'm merely stating that it is a ludicrous and unjustifiable accusation. If you honestly think that you can compare the United States to these dictators then you have a lot of learn about the world.

Why?

You claim to be such a rational and knowledgeable person and yet you have failed to provide valid arguments or data to backup your claims apart from that obvious ""we ain't mass killing our own"".

Resorting to attacking European problems to divert from the US discussion is pointless and childish. I, unlike you, do not suffer from the nationalism sentiment, I am more than willing to recognize, accept and try to solve Europe problems and flaws. Funny though, is that your exacerbated nationalism is another prominent trait of totalitarian regimes, it's called indoctrination.

But the problem lies precisely in this question, says Hrant Dink, publisher and editor-in-chief of the Istanbul-based Armenian weekly Agos. Turkey's bureaucratic elite have never really shed themselves of the Ottoman tradition — in the perpetrators, they see their fathers, whose honor they seek to defend. This tradition instills a sense of identity in Turkish nationalists — both from the left and the right, and it is passed on from generation to generation through the school system. This tradition also requires an antipole against which it could define itself. Since the times of the Ottoman Empire, religious minorities have been pushed into this role.[146]",0,1328226516,null,0,false,0,c3nc9kt,t3_p4lgm,t1_c3nc9kt,t1_c3mjmhk,null,1435744474,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
true,takeitlikeaditch,SLOV,Slovenia,"My Slovenian is kind of shit since I've been out of the country for so long, but my English is good, so here is my translation of her statement:

**On Thursday, 26 January 2012, in accordance, and under the instruction of the government of the Republic of Slovenia, I signed the inclusion of Slovenia to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).** A somewhat **longer explanation** in regards to the signing can be found in the Media center of the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which explains the contribution of MZZ, and also mine as the ambassador of the Republic of Slovenia in Japan. From the explanation, if follows that I signed the agreement because I was authorised to do so by the Republic of Slovenia, and because it was part of my job.

**But why did I sign ACTA? Every day through e-mail and Facebook, I am bombarded by questions, mostly friendly, but also irritated in nature, from people who do not understand why I would sign such a dangerous agreement to both the country and its people.** With this response, which is of an exclusively personal nature, and expresses only my own personal opinion, I wish to respond to them, friends and acquaintances who are silent, to the anonymous, and in the end, myself and my children.

**I signed ACTA from a civil negligence because I did not pay enough attention. Simply enough, I did not link the agreement, for whose signing I was authorised by my country, to that agreement, which in my civil opinion limits, and takes away freedom of operation on the largest and most important network in the history of mankind, and thus limits mainly the future of the generation of our children.** I afforded myself a period of civil peace of mind, for some time I disconnected from from the media reports from Slovenia, took a break from Avaaza and the inflation of its petitions - simply said, I gave myself a rest. In my defense, I tell myself that I really needed the rest, and that I am still having trouble gathering up the energy for a new year of the dragon. At the same time, I am trying to carry out the work that did not lessen with the arrival of the new year, if anything there is more than ever. Everything in the style of the [key?] that we - probably not just us diplomats - received in recent times; less for more *(I have no idea what the hell she is talking about here)*. Less money and less people for more work. And thus you overlook what it is you are signing. And the next morning you wake up with the weight of infinite lightness of some signature. *(again, no idea what she means by that)*.

**First I apologized to my children. Then I attempted to respond to the first acquaintances and strangers who marveled and were shocked. Because there are more and more, I am responding publicly. I wish to apologize, because, though I did fulfill my official duty, I did not fulfill my civic duty.** I do not know if I had the power to not sign, but I could have at least attempted it. I did not. I did not take the opportunity to fight for the right to conscientious objection from us bureaucrats.

**There is another, very important reason for my writing this. It is about a demonisation of *""some fool""*, that is, me, who had her hand in signing something in secret, far from home in Tokyo.** This was heard in the Slovenian Parliament and in the Slovenian media, and is spreading across the internet. It is dangerous mainly because it masks the responsibility of those who actually had the power of decision and actually made the call that Slovenia will join ACTA. The decision to join was made by the Slovenian government and the Committee of EU Affairs of the Slovenian Parliament, and before that Slovenia participated for quite some time in the coordination of the agreement. All of this was done not enough in front of the eyes of the public, according to the horrified responses that appeared after the formal signing. What to me seems very dangerous for the future (lack of) development of the democracy in Slovenia is that it was not just me that did not pay enough attention to the affairs of the government, we all failed as a people, in our civic duty. *(not to mention the opportunity for blah blah, something about the previous elections and how the government in slovenia is shit - that last part is implied)*.

**On Saturday, 4 February, a protest against ACTA will happen in Ljubljana.** The true worry and determination of the slovenian citizens, that we must stop the implementation of the agreement, will show in the number of people who will come join the rally. One of my concerned correspondents asked me what my brother, the late dr. Janez Drnovsek *(unimatrix: [""former"" communist and last president of Yugoslavia who was also the prime minister and later president of Slovenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janez_Drnov%C5%A1ek))* would think. The fight to preserve our civil liberties is certainly in the spirit of his heritage, much more than the removal or non-removal of some statue. Saturday's rally is just one small step in this everyday struggle with no end. **Let my example serve as a warning of how quickly we make mistakes if we wane. If nothing else, we will have trouble falling asleep at night.**

De esas, Granada fue mi ciudad favorita. Tienes que visitar la Alhambra y tratar de ir a la parte vieja (creo que tiene un nombre específico, pero se me ha olvidado) para ver las cuevas gitanas (gypsy caves). Si puedes, trata de estar para Corpus Cristi, porque hay una feria muy grande (como un carnival americano con muchas atracciones, gente bailando, etcétera). En Madrid, además de los museos más famosos, me gustaron mucho el Templo de Debod, el Museo Naval (cerca del Prado, y gratis), y el Museo Arqueológico (donde está la Dama de Elche). Un bar famoso para estudiantes extranjeros es el Tigre en Chueca (el distrito gay). Si quieres ir a un lugar diferente de las desinaciones corrientes, recomiendo San Sebastián (AKA Donostia) en el País Vasco en el norte. Ahí hay unas playas fantásticas (aunque dicen que llueve mucho en el verano) y es fácil ir a Francia o Bilbao.

Los españoles suelen ser muy simpáticas, aunque si eres una chica bella (y aún peor, rubia) te van a piropear mucho (es decir, comentar sobre tu belleza u otras cosas). Eso sucedió mucho a las chicas de mi grupo. Otra cosa que no me gustó de España fue que a veces es difícil practicar español porque los españoles quieren practicar su inglés. Muchas veces estaba yo hablando español y el español me respondía en inglés. A lo mejor en una ciudad menos internacional que Madrid eso no sería problema tan grande.

I just typed this all up and realized your said your Spanish isn't that great (but take heart, some people in my group spoke it much worse than you write it and got around fine).

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I think that historically, the lack of there even being a German nation state contributed to it. There were dozens of tiny countries, and especially during the Enlightenment some of the rulers were competing for cultural greatness and tried to attract the greatest minds of their day to their courts. If you have many monarchs, odds are some of them will seek greatness by founding and supporting universities and otherwise become cultural and scientific centers, especially if their size doesn't permit them to seek military greatness. Once you've got an established cultural center, it keeps fueling itself for a while, because the contemporary cultural and scientific elite likes to hang out with each other. Take tiny Weimar, for example. When I lived there, even after years I kept having ""what, [famous artist/scientist/philosopher] used to live here, too?""-moments.

Those decentralized cultural centers and small countries lead to a huge number of medium sized cities. Even today, compare Berlin (pop: 3.5 million) to the capitals of other large European countries. Have a look at [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Germany_by_population) and keep in mind that most of the larger cities used to be capitals of their own little state. With the Industrialization, many of them found their economic niche, and the common language and free trade within the [customs union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zollverein) certainly helped. Google ""straight razor Solingen"". Steel, blades and cutlery is what this city of 160k people still lives off today. Once the know-how is there, it gets passed down from one generation to the next, and becomes the go-to place if you want to do something in this direction.

This economy of decentralized specialization still sets Germany apart from most other countries. There are a couple of large household names, but the *Mittelstand*, the long tail of small and medium enterprises is unusually large. They're often family owned, so they're after long-term development, not quarterly profits. They usually specialize in boring stuff and are unknown to anybody outside of their industry, even though they may be the global number one in whatever they do and export their product all around the world. Since they're usually located in a small city, their owners are integrated into the local society instead of only moving in elite circles, and are dedicated to the economic prosperity of the region so they try to keep the jobs local.

Lately, what really helped is that Germany happens to make the stuff e.g., China needs to grow -- specialized machines for their factories, and cars for their nouveau riche. There's also a tight network of those *Mittelstand* companies sharing know-how and contacts for export markets, and they get a lot of support from politics.

Finally, that ""Made in Germany"" thing that the Brits insisted on so people would know what was the foreign inferior product back in the day, it still helps.

[These](http://aebrain.blogspot.com/p/reference-works-on-transsexual-and.html) should get you started.  It's a known phenomenon that happens prenatally.

&gt; 11 is not an age where you should have the ability to change your life into a fixed rail.

Which is exactly what having any puberty you're not sure you want would do.  Hence delaying it until she's older and can make a more informed decision.

&gt; waiting until you are of age, with no real negative perprecussions, because you cannot have the full picture right now

Hm, there is. So let's look what the easily-accessible sources (in this case: Wikipedia) say, huh?

&gt;  Some clinicians report a significant proportion of young children with gender identity disorder no longer have such symptoms later in life.

Or ... ""it just may be a phase"".

&gt;  It should be noted, however, that such blocking of growth hormones may cause significant detrimental musculo-skeletal problems if done for a prolonged period of time.

Or ... ""irrevocable medical issues in preventing puberty"".

&gt; Yet, because transexuality disturbs you personally and because one of the accepted treatments for Gender Dysphoria is sex reassignment, you will ignore the criteria and the diagnosis that best fits the situation and insist on a less accurate one instead

I am **not** disturbed by transsexuality. What **does** disturb me is seeing a healthy kid getting thrown into a legal mess because his/her parents fight, and now is supposed to do an unnecessary medical treatment to proove a point and to make her/him stand on a pedestal of self-proclaimed gender equality crusaders, stealing from him/her the opportunity to make an informed, adult decision later in life only *after* her/his body has been irrevocably altered (and yes, delaying puberty *will* alter her/his body and mental development.)

So, let's say he or she stays in a child-like limbo until at age 18, the doctors decide it's time to stop possibly dangerous medicamentation, he or she is old enough to choose. For reasons unknown, he or she decides either way. The appropriate steps are done.

Either way, she or he will have lost years in her mental and sexual development, lost opportunities to learn how to hook up with potential partners, how to act in an adult society. Hormones change behavior, as every parent of a teenage kid will tell you, and she or he will experience this at age 18 or 19, when he or she is supposed to be at university or working (which will probably lead to problems in either field).

There is a **persistent preoccupation with the dress and activities of the opposite sex** and **repudiation of the individual's own sex**. The diagnosis requires a profound disturbance of the normal gender identity; **mere tomboyishness in girls or girlish behavior in boys is not sufficient**.

Going through the wrong puberty gets in the way of wanting to date anyone anyway.  Avoiding that is worth delaying puberty for a while.  Yes, I'm aware of how hormones change behaviour, first hand, probably more than you are.  If she *doesn't* start hormone blockers now, and still does transition later (which sounds more than likely), she's just going to go through two puberties rather than one.  [Tgjer has have already pointed out to you](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/p5cj7/german_trans_girl_to_be_institutionalised/c3mxvkn) just why going through the wrong puberty before the right one would cause irreversible damage.

She won't be lagging behind her peers for the rest of her life.  Sure, she will at first, although having just the one puberty, the right one, should actually *minimise* the delay.  It's not like she's condemned to live out her whole life in everyone else's shadow as a result, however.  I've actually overtaken many of my peers in terms of career now, for example, despite (or perhaps because of) my initial setback.

&gt; But it still is a problem.

Sure, but it's still *less* of a problem than going through the natural puberty and then the right one some years later would be.  *Far* less.

&gt; We've all, regardless of our gender perception, had our bad teenage years. It is pretty natural.

You've clearly never seen a transsexual going through their teenage years.  In between my two puberties, the first natural, the second due to taking the hormones I needed, my mother was constantly worried I'd kill myself.  Once I finally got on the right hormones, it was ""like she finally got her happy child back.""  She sent the gender-specialising-psychiatrist I was seeing who'd prescribed the pills a thank-you letter and everything.  Sure, I'm an only child, so there's no ""control group"" here, but I gather most children don't have her-mother's-constantly-worried-she'll-kill-herself teenage years.",0,1328263930,null,0,true,0,c3nh8os,t3_p5cj7,t1_c3nh8os,t1_c3nh4lm,null,1428288880,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3
