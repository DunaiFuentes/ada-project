&gt;Auch der Abmahnindustrie könnten unerwartete Turbulenzen drohen. Den Rechteinhabern hat der Gesetzgeber einen eigenen zivilrechtlichen Auskunftsanspruch eingeräumt. Werden mit Rücksicht auf die Verfassung möglicherweise sogar die Rechte der Strafverfolger eingeschränkt, führt diese zwangsläufig zu der Frage, ob der Auskunftsanspruch der Abmahner noch verhältnismäßig ist.

Quote from the article ""Not All Business Problems Have Solutions"". Exactly! This doesn't mean we/politicians/economists shouldn't try to find solutions, but all those zealots that believe that they (and only they) have **the** right solution and interpretation of the crisis (""Just pour more money into Greece, it wasn't their fault, the Germans did it!"", ""Just stop giving any money into Greece, it was their fault alone!"") are deceiving themselves and others. The problem is too complex for any analysis that simple, and there are good arguments for and against most of the proposed solutions. I really like this article for precisely this reason: any of the solutions is countered by rational arguments why it is not ideal. Once everyone understands this much, that no solution is ideal, we can start trying to determine what is the *optimal, given the circumstances* solution.

This isn't a question of absolutes. A  'zero waste' economy is, of course, a nonsensical piece of marketing; but the idea that we should strive at all costs to cut down waste is daft because we don't do anything *at all costs*. so the point would be to balance the *cost* of having waste, and maybe paying to have it dealt with, to the *cost* of struggling not to produce it or to reuse it.

Let me quote Tim Worstall, talking about 'Zero Waste Scotland':

&gt;*For what they're going to find is that, measured by how well we prevent the planet from burning up, we already recycle too much. For example, we crush up green glass to be used as underlay for roads: this produces more CO2 then simply dumping it. Dumping waste food underground and collecting the methane (as we do at every landfill now) produces fewer greenhouse gases than sticking it into a wormery: worms do that eructation thing you see, just with NOx which is 10 times more polluting that methane.*

That the euro is probably 30% overvalued for Greek needs is a Kafkaesque absurdity lost entirely, apparently, upon the Germans.

&gt; Exactly, you agree. You are enforcing your traditionalist beliefs on others. The existence of people who do the opposite doesn't seem to phase you. You don't need to pull out the reflexive anti-capitalism. Instead you could respect modern lifestyles, alternative working hours and individual differences. Other countries manage to function just fine without being artificially restricted on the basis of religion.

You make a host of assumptions about me that could not be more wrong if you tried. How am I enforcing *anything*? Traditionalist beliefs, reflexive anti-capitalism, not caring about people different from me? I don't *respect* differences? And again, why are you talking about religion? I am an atheist, and our current legal situation *isn't based* on religion - it is merely an accepted social convention that is a holdover from more religious times.

&gt; Any constitution that uses explicitly defends ""spirituality"" is in need of reform. Basically, the fact that the Protestant and Catholic churches can bully shops into conforming to their bullshit signifies that the constitution is flawed.

Not sure if Greece would be up for it.

And if I have the settings of my PS3 to English, most games will start up with the English version rather than German (as most games here are at least hard-coded with English, French, Italian, German and Spanish). Also, if you have any HDMI ready TV, just hooking your Xbox 360 or PS3 up with an HDMI cable is as easy as it is back home.

As for playing online, I experience no issues, except having to be up late to play with people back in the states. This goes for both my PS3 and 3DS. I have generally found internet connections in Germany to be much faster than in the States.

As for violent games, I have always either bought them on a trip over, or just had a friend bring it when he/she came to visit.

Mi hija tiene vientiún años y quedaba en España desde agosto. Todo era bien hasta enero cuando la comunicación entre nosotros cambiaba a ser casí nunca. El 21 de enero, perdió a su vuelo a los Estados Unidos, y nos dijo que el vuelo estaba el 21 de febrero. No tuve acceso a su itinerario entonces, la creí. 

Después de muchas semanas sin comunicaciones, el 20 de febrero me llamó de un café Internet a Alicante. Dijo que está viviendo por los calles, durmiendo en las cajas de cartón, y comiendo la comida de las basuras. Dijo que no tenía bastante dinero para ir a Barcelona para coger su vuelo. Le pregunté de controlar su intinerario y descubrió que estaba equivocada respecto de la fecha de su vuelo. Ella tiene síndrome de Asperger. Aunque puede relacionarse bien, no tiene sentido común. 
Le dije de descubrir cuánto dinero necesitaría por viajar a Barcelona y llamarme otra vez  para que le enviamos dinero, y dijo que lo haría. 
No he sentido más que una palabra desde he enviado esta mensaje. Ni correos electrónicos ni Facebook, ni nada. Por cierto, me preocupo muchísimo. 

Es una persona confiada, y viajaría con alguien que siembra amable. Por suerte, puede hablar español muy bien, y además conoce el francés, alemán, y ruso. 

¿Alguien tiene amigos que conoce la zona entre Alicante y Barcelona? Puede ser en cualquier lugar. ¿Es segura la Alicante? ¿Qué es la actualidad sobre las drogas? ¿Hay agencia de policía o gobierno que puede ayudarme en encontrarla?

Gracias.

Since the town started targeting the soldiers with its marketing, you can quite frequently see some American families in town. (No, they are not easy to recognize. I only ever met polite and nice Americans, by the way.)

The base was also extended recently (that was, I think, a consolidation effort, not an extension of US military presence in Germany overall) and some families moved into town. There were also some houses built for them. The US military also only recently started broadcasting the [American Forces Network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Forces_Network) on FM in the region. (Which, despite having no doubt the lowest budget of all radio stations in the region, still manages to beat all the others. Yep, we have nothing but shitty radio stations here. Did I fall in some sort of wormhole and end up in the fifties when only AFN played the good stuff, or what? Only the endless PSAs on AFN about depression, suicide, alcohol abuse and so on really get me down. I guess it’s not easy being a soldier.)

They are an economic factor (as tourists, basically), but since the town I’m living in could get by without them for decades (because they would rather travel to Nuremberg, Regensburg or even Munich and never even consider other options when they want to go shopping) they really don’t matter.

They do matter for the really small town directly next to the base where many jobs would be at stake. Them leaving would be like losing a large employer. Many there work directly or indirectly for the base. (Heck, even my dad, who is an engineer, moved an air control tower for the US military in the eighties and did some more mundane work for them later.) All this wouldn’t matter for Germany as a whole, but it would matter for those living directly next to the military bases. I can already hear the wails of the local politicians (should those US military bases ever decide to close).

—

I’m unsure about the future. The US Army only recently built this [mini version of suburbia](http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Netzaberg_Housing_Area_Grafenwoehr_Germany_2008.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20081115222402) on top of a hill nearby, but they also only recently announced that they will move troops out of Germany. I’m guessing the base will always be at least some sort of logistics hub and training ground.

So, I’m not affected by it one way or another. I guess those whose jobs depend on it would be quite upset if the US military left. I don’t really have any ideological reservations against the US military having bases in Germany.

I would also like to point out that in your case the amount necessary to keep in reserve would lead to severe restriction with loan policies. Essentially it would take time back 20-30 years when the only people who could get loans were the ones who could back their loan with extant assets. That would lead to increase of inequality among citizens as even well earning people without financial backing from their family or relatives couldn't get loans for housing or starting businesses.

I would also like to point out that printing money is taxing people who hold money. Most rich or well to do people don't actually have cash, but have invested it to inflation safe investments like housing and stocks. The people who are most hurt of inflation are the middle and lower classes who aren't protected from the inflation and whose wages and living standards are being suppressed by always increasing prices. Worse than that, high inflation will make upwards social mobility practically impossible as people can't save money for future investments like housing or starting a business as inflation eats up their money.

The best way for state to fund its activities is throe taxation with tax code that has the least amount of deductions as possible. This way people know how much they are paying and who is doing the paying. In my honest opinion paying up state finances with printing money is cowardly as politicians are then taxing the population without them largely knowing about it.

So they live in this limbo and the Serbian state needs to occasionally move them to shelters when the temperature goes below 0.

Your ridiculous and patronizing suggestion that the authors of the WSWS have only ""skimmed Marx and Trotsky"" and are unaware of the Frankfurt School, reveals just how little you know about the World Socialist Website and how unserious and inaccurate your whole analysis of the journalism produced by WSWS is.

In regards to your accusation that the WSWS is unaware of the works of the Frankfurt School I suggest you read a  book by the WSWS which outlines its opposition ""against pseudo-Marxist conceptions prevalent among various philosophical tendencies influenced by the *Frankfurt School* and contemporary neo - utopianism"", http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/aug2007/marx-a24. (Marxism, History &amp; Socialist Consciousness)

I find it interesting that you associate the language of the WSWS with the ""rabble-rousing slogans like in 1920s"", what does this say about the objective economic and political reality of today or as you say the ""parallel universe"". 

I also associate your poorly researched and unfounded anti-socialist rhetoric and bluster also with the 1920's but with organisations *maybe* you would not wish to be associated with. You are not one to decide what is "" on par with the modern discourse.""

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; You really have to ask yourself why we are using privately owned central banks at all.

We don't. You may have seen one of those YouTube videos by the ""abolish the Fed"" nut cases that gave you this impression, but the Fed is a very special case in that it's technically owned by private institutions.  
The ECB's shareholders are the (usually, there *might* be an exception or two that are *technically* private) publicly owned national central banks of the member states.

&gt; CREATED OUT OF THIN AIR

OMG, witchcraft!

&gt; We need at take back the power to create money from these private banks and have our governments create their own debt free money,

You have a problem with fractional reserve banking, and want to replace it with a system where you literally just print money?

&gt; reducing your taxes and taking away the gun the central bank holds at our economies head.

The ECB is set up to be as independent from governments as possible to prevent just that. There are two very good reasons why letting governments print money is a bad idea. One is that it almost inevitably leads to hyperinflation. We had that in the Weimar Republic, where bills were used as wallpaper and even for heating. On payday, women picked up their husbands with wheelbarrows for the cash, and then raced to the nearest shops to spend it all before prices went up further. Some people patiently waited for the retirement account that they had payed into for their whole working life to come due, picked up the whole amount, and spent it all on one loaf of bread. It's just not a good idea.  
The other reason is slightly more complicated. Just to pull a number out of my ass, let's assume that 20% of Greece's government spending is *actually* wasteful, in the sense that it's not used in a productive manner. This could be because corruption and nepotism leads to public contracts that are either unnecessary or go to contractors that overcharge and/or create sub-par results, because departments are overstaffed or unnecessary, or simple embezzlement. Effectively, this means you work an hour everyday not for yourself, but for somebody else. Those aren't even the government as a whole, but individual public employees and contractors that are either incompetent or frauds. There needs to be an incentive to reign in that problem -- the ability to simply print money would have the opposite effect, it would create an incentive to spend even more.

&gt; Greece is in this trouble in no small part due to the money it owes the central bank

Wrong. The ECB by now holds a significant amount of Greek debt, but it's far from the majority, and they only hold that much because the private holders offloaded a large part to the ECB (at an estimated average of about 70% of its face value).

Greece is in trouble because it has a governance problem and issues with corruption, nepotism and sheer incompetence. This leads to an inefficient bureaucracy. You can't have a competitive economy under conditions like that -- this overhead of wasteful spending (*actual* wasteful spending, not the US-Tea-Party-style buzzword), and the inefficiencies of the bureaucracy's incompetence and red tape, goes straight out of productivity. (Just to be clear: There's nothing wrong with high taxes and regulation, but those taxes need to be spend in ways, and the regulations have to serve purposes, that benefit society.)  
Now, you could print money to make up for that, but what you'd save in taxes would instead be lost to inflation -- nominally, your net salary would be higher, but you could buy less with it. You could make all of Greece's debt go away, and a couple of years later they would have the same problem, because the underlying cause still hasn't been addressed. Even if they would magically keep a balanced budget, that unproductive overhead would still be lost to the dysfunctional bureaucracy, instead of either benefitting society as a whole or the standard of living of the individual. If an individual public employee does nothing but sitting on his hands all day, this will go out of the earnings of another individual tax payer either in Greece or abroad, and it will remain that way until the core issue has been addressed. *Someone* will have to pay for it, one way or the other, sooner or later with compound interest. Where the actual cash that pays for the waste and fraud comes from, whether that's from the printing press, lenders or tax payers, has preciously little to do with that.

Edit: The problem Europe as a whole is facing is that you can't just buy an efficient bureaucracy that would make a competitive economy possible in Greece, we have to rely on the dysfunctional bureaucracy we've been dealt to heal itself, preferably without trampling all over Greece's sovereignty that it represents. The problem Greeks are facing is that this dysfunctional bureaucracy goes for the lowest hanging fruits instead, and that happens to be the taxes and benefits of the ones that are the least responsible for the causes.",0,1330181626,null,0,true,0,c3uvhmm,t3_q57y8,t1_c3uvhmm,t1_c3utzq2,null,1428418185,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

[IMF say so](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,817152,00.html), [ECB too](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203824904577212763546615878.html?mod=googlenews_wsj). And what is worst, is that shortage is happening only for political reasons. No recovery it's possible in those conditions, Bernanke docet. Maybe if the target an higher NGDP it will be fine. But a lot of German politicians (and public opinion) seem to have moral issues with that (maybe the German fear of hyperinflation is real, bad memories from Weimar, but also the current [deflation](http://alea.tumblr.com/post/16532792602/eurozone-m3-annual-growth-rate) isn't really better).

- Do it between friends
- Use the correct tone of voice

You unfortunately fail on the first one, because (I assume) most Brits don't know you well enough to tell when you're joking. This isn't helped by your failure on the second part, since you're communicating in a text-only medium and thus you need to specifically point out your tone of voice to not have your message taken at face value by many people. A simple /joke would have sufficed. Because of this problem, your edit seems very condescending as well. One might go as far as to say butthurt.

Finally, there's a difference between someone taking the piss out of something that is theirs, and taking the piss out of something that is someone else's. If it's not yours, don't automatically assume you can do it.

It's like how parents can call their children every name under the sun, but will get defensive if someone else says the same about their kids.

* [The Decalogue](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092337/): Particularly #1 and #5. #1 left me puzzled and angry, a very powerful experience. It took me some time to appreciate it. #5 is recommended for the simple honesty of its scenes.

* [Life is Beautiful](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118799/): The horror film that never was. There's something very scary about the whole idea of a death camp portrayed as a game. 

* [In Bruges](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780536/): Beautiful mix of drama and dark comedy.

* [Let the Right One In](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139797/): Not very strong but it really manages to pull off an atmosphere of isolation.

* [Pan's Labyrinth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/): Great magical realism. I like how the two worlds choreographically clash and complement each other.

* [8½](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056801/): Best WTF of the century. Also, very good use of self-reference.

In recent years Bulgarian cinema has been on the rise, so here are a some of my favourites:

* [Eastern Plays](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1426361/) - it's about finding meaning, a quest for the ""real"" and the ""authentic"". The movie is about the inner struggles of the main character, who's not a professional actor and plays himself in the movie. He's a drug addict and died of overdose shortly after the movie was shot. Although his character is authentic, the story in the movie is fictional. 
* [The World is Big and Salvation Lurks Around the Corner](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1178197/) - a great trip back home.
* [Zift](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1264914/) - A Bulgarian neo-noir movie. 

From Poland, I really like Krzysztof Kieślowski's movies. An extremely beautiful cinematography. I would recommend watching [The Three Colours Trilology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Colors_Trilogy). 

[The Day of the Wacko](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330243/) is another Polish movie I like. I love it for its bitterness.

Serbia is famous for its comedies. I'd recommend [Who Sings Over There](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076276/) - although it was filmed in 1980, it is still hillarious.

I'd love to see something from the Baltics as well, so it would be great if people from this part of Europe take part in the discussion. ",0,1330258376,null,0,true,0,c3v5aa2,t3_q5zal,t1_c3v5aa2,t1_c3v0lyu,null,1435737979,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

I second the RER.  It starts at CDG, so you are sure to get a seat and stow your luggage.  Just follow the signs that say 'Trains to Paris' and get on the RER B to Robinson or Remi Les Chevreuses.  It's hard to mess up.  Stay on until Denfert-Rochereau (some people say to change at Chatelet, but line 4 is pretty packed sometimes and the station is big and kinda sketch, but not terrible).  At Denfert, you transfer to line 6 to Etoile.  You will need to go down a set of stairs and up one, which sucks, but it's not terrible. It's like 3 stops to Montparnasse.  Once in Montparnasse follow the signs to Suburban Trains.  Then, relax and have a sandwich from Paul.

If you have some time you can check your bags into lockers for a few hours.  There is a luggage check on the 1st floor, kinda hard to find but there are some maps available.  Here is a handy [Imgur]Map(http://i.imgur.com/9DKaR.png) . Red marks Paul.  If you wanna get a nice shot of the Eiffel tower, follow the blue line on the right.. go up the escalator/stairs and continue straight through the parking garage.  You will end up on Vaugirard and if you look to the right, you have a great view of almost the entire tower in the distance.

In terms of local places to eat/drink if you check your bags and have some time:  walk over to rue de la Gaite and there are a few cafes, theaters (and sex shops) but you should be able to find something.  I recommend Le Cafe Tournesol.  If you stand/sit at the bar, you can get a wine for a few euros.

Cheers and good luck.  Should be cake!",0,1330263766,null,0,false,0,c3v5n1c,t3_q61wo,t1_c3v5n1c,t3_q61wo,null,1428423043,3,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,3

It’s the usual way of doing things. You get in touch with a professor, send them an exposé of your project — it comes handy to already have one before getting in touch — and there you go. If you have previously studied under a professor and are on good terms with him or her, you are likely to be accepted even without a fully spelled-out research proposal, maybe even getting a RA position funded by the university or by one of the foundations financing research. Such are the mores here.

As Elsaxxx said, there aren’t many structured PhD programs here, and they are usually fairly competitive. The “informal” approach is just between you and the professor, as far admission is concerned, so if they like you, your exposé and your credentials, you’re all set. Getting a scholarship or funding for your project is an entirely different beast, however… 

Think twice about applying for publicly announced RA positions, in many cases the announcements are just a formality and they know EXACTLY whom they are going to hire, usually someone who studied at the same university.

true,klabauterfrau,null,null,"Every now and then your exact same question pops up in this thread. 
I posted the following earlier and people seemed to have appreciated the information.
Dortmund has anything you need. If you live on campus in a Studentenwohnheim, a grocery store is in walking distance.

Things to do: For drinks and bars find the Kreuzviertel. Lots of good bars and pubs. There is also a good little club there: Silent Sinners. Also for clubbing and concerts: FZW near the Hauptbahnhof. They have good concerts and clubnights. (The audience for some of the clubnights is a littel older, though.) If you like it rough an dirty, go to the Spirit. It is a club owned by the local biker gang. Better after 2 or 3 am, best very drunk !

Dortmund brews its own mircobrew: Hövels. Go out for a traditional German food and beer night in the Hövelsbrauerei. Maybe after you saw a play in the theatre. The ""Studiobühne"" in the ""Schauspielhaus"" has pretty good experimental stuff going on and tickets are half off for students (bring your student ID).

Do you like climbing? Dortmund has the best climbing hall of the whole Ruhrpott (that is what we call the Ruhrgebiet). It is on the outskrits, but well worth it (www.kletterhalle-bergewerk.de).

In the summer: Rombergpark and Westfalenpark for some great walks. For some beer drinking (and other things) at night: West Park

The Nordstadt may look a little rough at the beginning, but you will find some very good ethnic food there and some cool bars, too.

For getting away I would recommend the nearby lakes (Möhne, Sorpe, etc.) All the other surrounding towns have cool stuff, too. Bochum for example also has a very cool bar scene. You can travel for free with your Stundtenticket in all of NRW. Make use of it. But do not even try to understand the train system, just ask other people to help you.

For being up to date, get a Coolibri magazine at the beginning of the month. You will find it in most bars to take for free. It will give you info on the best things to do in town.

Have fun in Dortmund. It is a great place. At the beginning you might think that it is ugly, since a lot of its pretty parts were destroyed in WWII and rebuilt in the 50s and 60s. But be assured, it has a lot of pretty places, is very diverse, has a lot of ""underground"" culture. The people are a little rough in the beginning, but have a ""soft heart under a rough shell"". (That's a German saying: Harte Schale, weicher Kern.)

If you meet Prof. Walter Grünzweig (which I am sure you will): He is awesome.

* Erdmöbel

Man nimmt sich einen Germanisten/Gitarristen, lässt ihn dichten/komponieren, dann trommelt man den Rest der Band zusammen, lässt die herumfeilen bis alle zufrieden sind, nimmt den Song im eigenen Studio auf und dann darf der Bassist/Produzent noch herumarrangieren.

Was mir gefällt: Munteres Schlagzeug, melodischer Bass, prominentes Klavier, Posaune (besonders die Posaunensoli bei den Konzerten sind garantierte Highlights), Texte die locker von der Zunge rollen aber trotzdem mysteriös bleiben, und dass sie ihren Sound immer entwickeln und neue Sachen probieren; [dieser Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fid4BgPnTVQ) ist zwar schön, aber keineswegs repräsentativ.

* LaBrassBanda

You can totally bring it up, like any topic of similar gravity.

I see it this way: You can and should make a joke about absolutely any topic, but a joke that can hurt people is only permissible if you either need it as an outlet to deal with a difficult situation, or if it is truly hilarious.

true,Brainsen,null,null,"Hi, posted somewhat similar in a different thread, so this might help:

German here, just submitted my PhD thesis (history) in England, did my Magister in Germany. There are certain things you definitely should know.

The regulations regarding PhDs vary widely from university to university or by federal state. Only some unis have grad schools / structured programs where you have to go to classes, teach etc. Normally you just write write write. In contrast to England, there often do not exist any regulations regarding meetings with your supervisor you are entitled to etc. Also, your supervisor normally is also your final and only examiner (well, there is also a second one but they rarely read the thesis). This makes you really dependent on him/her which can lead to quite uncomfortable situations if you disagree about research design / methodology etc or if he/she just is an arsehole.

To acquire your title in Germany, you are legally required to publish your thesis, in most cases in almost the exact same format you handed it in. Since you cannot change it for the market, this may lead to significant additional costs since you might have to pay a publisher to put it out in some form. Also, there is no word limit, so German thesis in the humanities can easily exceed 300 pages.

Regarding money, there are a lot of foundations where you could apply. Tuition costs, however, are negligible in comparison to the US or the UK. Scholarships are normally between € 900 and € 1200 a month and limited to three years, grad schools might give a bit more. Of course, it really depends how expensive the city is you live in, normally, this allows you to remain slightly above poverty level. There are also a lot of part-time posts where you are supposed to work/teach 20 hrs/week and get about €1200 after taxes (TVL-13, 50%). However, the workload can be significantly higher, depending on how much of an arsehole your supervisor / professor at the institute is. Since you completely depend on him, you cannot really object to the additional work in this setting.

Edit: and to answer your question - yes, it is normal and expected in the German system to get in contact with professors. Until a couple of years ago, it was up to professors to suggest to YOU that you should take up a PhD and didn't work the other way around,",0,1330301354,null,0,false,0,c3vb4tf,t3_q6u77,t1_c3vb4tf,t3_q6u77,null,1428425690,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

FTFY

Per rispondere alla domanda ti posso dire che non credo si possa già parlare di influenze rilevanti nell'arte da parte dell'immigrazione, dato che è un fenomeno relativamente giovane per l'Italia.  
Per il cibo è probabilmente già diverso: personalmente ho constatato un boom di locali con cibo etnici (ristorante cinese e kebab su tutti), tanto che se fino a pochi anni fa questo genere di cibi si potevano trovare solo in grosse città ora sono diffusi anche nei piccoli comuni di provincia.

true,BeardBeeman,null,null,"I lived in Palma for a couple of years. I highly recommend getting around the Island to some of the smaller towns as well. Never went to Magaluf, so don't really know much about it beyond it being full of drunk British tourists. I highly recommend you look at the CouchSurfing group in Mallorca, it is extremely active and there are multiple weekly activities to check out. Look at the hiking group as well, they do something every Saturday during the day. As far as things in Palma go:

Food: 
I recommend the Ruta Martiana, which is a tapas crawl in the old city that happens every Tuesday, tons of restaurants and bars participate, tapas are usually 1 euro or maybe 2 if it is particularly nice. If you decide to do that, make sure you hit up L'Ambigu (i still dream about their pincho of pate, blue cheese and balsalmic glaze) and Molta Barra (huge portions, cool bar and great food). 
Go for dinner the neighborhood of Santa Catalina, lots of great little bars and restaurants.
My favorite restaurant in the city is Bar Dia on C/ Apuntadors, great traditional tapas and they make a killer steak with chips and salad for like 11 euros.
Bungalow in Es Molinar makes insanely good paella and has a nice wine list and is not so expensive, if the weather is good you can sit on the edge of the sea.

Clubs and Bars:
If you're going to clubbing in Palma, Cultura Club is my favorite club, indie rock on Fridays and electronic music on Saturdays.

Ca'n Angel, I can't really remember which street this is on as I always came away drunk as hell. They have bottles of Pomada (menorcan gin called Xoriguer mixed with lemonade) which they serve in the gin bottles and pull out of the cooler for you.

Guirigall, Valhalla and Lorien are all within walking distance of each other near the Plaça del Mercat and are geared toward nice beer. They have extensive, international beer menus.

Rest of the Island: Soller, Deia and Valldemossa are great little towns in the mountains, not much to do other than walk around, drink a coffee and enjoy the scenery.
You're a little early for swimming, but it might be warm enough for the beach. My favorite beach within access of Palma is Ses Illetes, take the number three bus to the end and head to the cover on the left, which is less developed.
