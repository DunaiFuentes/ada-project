It is actually quite like the movie Mean Girls. 

Someone creates this instagram account where they first asks people to submit pictures and info about ""sluts"". This account soon becomes very popular. The pictures are usually just peoples facebook profile pictures or similar, but added to these pictures are accusations of different sorts. Think an online version of the ""Burn Book"" from Mean Girls if you've seen that movie. 

The poster wrote that this or that person has slept with this many people, and she was cheating that many times on her boyfriend etc etc. 

This of course made a lot of people very angry, and after a while they started a facebook group/event where they encourage people to go to the school where the some believe that the creator of the Instagram account studies. I haven't seen this page myself, but rumor has it that they told people to ""have their revenge"". 

A few hundred people show up, and as always there are going to be idiots who get violent, and there are videos circulation showing one girl getting kicked in the head while she is lying on the street. I've seen 3 videos of this, and it looks as it though they show different beatings, but could be the same beating from different angles too. The police say that they do not know if anyone is injured, which would suggest that she did not get a very serious beating. 

The riots then spread to Nordstan (a mall) nearby, and stones were thrown against police and passing cars. 


The school in question is called PlusGymnasiet, and as a resident in Gothenburg I'd say it's not a very good school. Most students there are there only because they could not get into a better school, and I'd guess most students failed at least one class in elementary school. 

The person who posted on the Instagram account uses horrible grammar, and can't even spell Cheese. 

As a resident of Gothenburg this entire thing is just embarrassing. First of, why some punk as teenager takes the time to post rumors, lies and other discrediting insults about more than 200 people in just a few days is beyond my comprehension. Secondly, that people are so fucking stupid as to just organize a mob and beat up the first suitable candidate to who did things (no-one actually knows who is behind the account) is scary. Even more so now that they attacked passing cars and police too. 

Really pisses me off. Wish these people would go back under the fucking rock where they came from and just spare the world of their idiocy. ",0,1355878803,null,0,false,0,c7isuat,t3_151uff,t1_c7isuat,t1_c7ijsc5,null,1430712689,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

You claimed,and I am quoting here ""e, but artificially increasing the interest-rate, while in the worst financial crisis since urban skydiving without parachutes was last in fashion amongst businessmen, doesn't seem... unbelievably outrageous to you?

I never said it wasn't. In fact, I think it is horrible. 

However, I'd like you to explain to me, how *skydiving*(or whatever you claim) is worse, in any way, than the fact the *every Euro country apart from Finland, Estonia (and Sweden* who is not really a Euro country, but hey, lets give them three), didn't follow the Euro rules.

You do know the rules of the Euro, don't you? 

The rules that says that *each country is responsible for their own debt*. *No other countries tax payers should be responsible for any other tax payers debt*. *Anyone who breaks the rules will be fined*

I am sure you know the rules. The Euro countries did. They signed up for them, around 300 millions of them, and then they decided not to give a fuck. They caused the Euro crises. Sweden didn't. We are to small. Denmark didn't, you are even smaller. UK didn't, they are not in the Euro and they actually want things to work.

 I am not drunk, not rambling, but if I point out, that southern Europe, truly fucked up - I will get downvoted. Frankly, I do not give a damn.

What I would like for you and southern Europe (but do not expect,because I do not think you think that way), is to give me a sheet of how much you cost the EU every year- and why. Why is Lithuania supposed to pay for Greece, and for how long. I'd like to see an end sum over what they contribute to the EU,please.
Why is that OK with you. Why are you aruing about skydiving when Greece is lying about its debt. 

I do not think I will be provided with that. If you have it, you will never give it to me. It is like asking Italians why they re-elect Berlusconi. I personally find the fact that any countries elect and re-elect Berlusonci disgusting, but I guess that is another thing that will get me banned.Guess what- I do not care, he is an asshole, and the Italians who constantly elect him are too. If you do not like my opinion - fuck you.

Il che, profilandosi una campagna elettorale Monti versus Bersani, è anche semplice. A vantaggio di Sel giocherà anche il fattore del cosiddetto voto utile: agli elettori di sinistrissima timorosi di disperdere il voto scegliendo qualche partitino o Grillo verrà offerta la possibilità di scegliere un partito gagliardamente di sinistra eppure con una prospettiva di governo. L'unico serio rischio che corre Vendola è una vittoria non netta del centrosinistra (ovvero Senato ingovernabile): in quel caso, Bersani dovrebbe andare a trattare con Monti e la condizione per intavolare la trattativa sarebbe sfanculare Sel (e Bersani non chiede altro se non un pretesto per farlo)

* Prc e arancioni (che andranno insieme quindi li cumulo) - Confusione media. L'obiettivo è svuotare Grillo offrendo al suo elettorato un'alternativa istituzionalmente più educata e rassicurante. La piattaforma è più o meno la stessa (solo con un po' di antimafia professionale in più dato che c'è di mezzo Ingroia) ed il bacino di utenza cui ci si rivolge pure. Le prospettive sono abbastanza fosche (Bersani l'accordo con questa gente non lo farà mai, e quindi toccherà prendere il 4% che è tanta roba) ed il rischio di non entrare in Parlamento c'è tutto. Qui si vedrà anche quanto consenso riesce a conservare Di Pietro dopo che mezzo partito gli ha detto arrivederci e grazie per andarsi ad alleare col Pd (con l'obiettivo dichiarato di portargli via voti)

* Radicali - Confusione abnorme. Bersani non ha confermato l'accordo che si era fatto con Veltroni, quindi niente posti sicuri col centrosinistra.

No I do not miss the point of the federation. Please, give me the legal grounds why a Swedish taxpayer are to pay off a Greece tax payers debt, since the Greeks can't be bothered.

I'd have missed this in the legal and scientific fact. Please, provide them. Otherwise, you are talking about your dreams. No facts, anywhere. Just give me the legal facts.

    Anything else is just a scheme to fleece to poor and relatively powerless and leave them worse off than they would be not participating in the scheme.

Oh, the end. Just to make me feel bad. Truly, you have not provided me with any arguments why the Swedes should work to pay off Greece's debt, but more importantly, you choose to ignore what I actually said.

Here it is again. This time you can't cheat, or ignore it. Please, explain scientifically why I shouldn't act this way of you disagree with me, and provide me with the links please, or just shut up. So, here it is:

I will not pay of Greece's debt. I do not think that is the responsiblitity of the tax payers of the northern countries, even if you do

I would like you to provide me with the above all legal papers, that says I am obliged to pay towards anyone, and the scientific papers, that says it actually makes a difference. I'd also like you to provide me with the scientific and legal reasoning behind the fact that the Euro countries decided not to follow the rules. I'd also like for you to ecxplain to me (legaly, sientifically etc) why they should not pay fines and follow the rules. I have access to all online academic journarls, so please, give me not only a good reason, but also a good excuse why other countries (like DK) should pay for anything. Preferably from an economical, DK way. .

I am guessing you will not even answer me. You do not care about right/wrong/ or what is actually legal. If you do, please provide me with the papers please. Otherwise- you are just another person who do not care if countries lie/cheat and steal. If you cared, you would try to change it.

I will happily, as a tax payer, pay towards poorer countries. I will be happy to see my money make a soignificant change in Malawai, Afghanistan, Ruwanda and other countries. However, I do not think Greece is one of those countries.

Please, explain to me why the world is better off paying off the Greek middle class than Ruwanda? Scientifically please.

Above all, I'd like you to explain why I, in any way, have caused Greece.

It helps build regions that need to catch up rather than making those regions effective slaves of the richer regions.

Of course. I choose to support Ruwanda, it is a poor region. Do you choose Greece? Why? Have you thought about how many African children who dies... You tried to make me feel bad, how about you. Why do you not support Africa?

Were you paying attention to Bush's wars? The US military just got done getting defeated twice by cavemen with rudimentary weapons. It's more than possible particularly since the military will have to kill its own people, who will be simultaneously starving it of cash.

&gt;Correction: Simple-minded Irrelevant anecdote.

How the hell is it irrelevant? The spree killer with the highest body count so far was able to perform his atrocity in a country with strict gun control laws. The people of Norway still get massacres just like the US. The fact that something is devastating to your argument doesn't somehow make it ""irrelevant"".

&gt;Then that's just factually incorrect.

Then point me to this fact that proves it incorrect.

Also a good note: be sure you have proof of having had your licence for a year+. Some North American licences don't show it.

2. There's the obvious Nürburgring. There may be age issues there as well. Maybe other people will have ideas. As for museums/factories you have to see Transparent Factory in Dresden and the Autostadt in Wolfsburg. One fun thing might be [Classic Remise](http://www.remise.de/Classic-Remise-Berlin-english-summary.php) in Berlin. Other obvious things would be BMW Museum in Munich and the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart.

3. Hiking is pretty much Germany's favorite past time. There are trails literally everywhere. My favorite trails are in the Sächsische Schweiz (near Dresden). I also liked the many trails on Rügen, particularly the famous Jasmund National Park near Sassnitz. Also I can recommend much in Thüringen, specifically around Eisenach. Additionally the Harz Mountains would provide great hiking. Obviously the Alps would good too, but people with more thorough knowledge of the South can recommend there.

4. I'm sure someone can fill you in.

6. I quite liked Warnemünde up on the Baltic coast. But more realistically you are going to be near lakes and there are an innumerable amount of lakes to swim in in Germany.

Just as they were in Norway.

And what happens when the United States' source of funding dries up due to a civil war? Also, citation needed on that ""funding both sides"" bit. Even if you should be able to produce such a citation, the fact remains that the US is losing both wars to cavemen with primitive arms.

A historical fact is not an anecdote. And no, I'm using that event to demonstrate that gun regulation cannot make homicide ""extinct"". I'm using it to demonstrate that it is utterly useless against a determined individual. When the modern record-holder for spree kills did his deed in a society that severely limits gun ownership, it completely destroys the argument that gun control will prevent such things.

But the assertion that he would've done it anyway is.

&gt; Just as they were in Norway.

A) He had to resort to the US to get the ammo.
And B) I'm glad you like to dismiss peer-reviewed papers with the same anecdote.

&gt; And what happens when the United States' source of funding dries up due to a civil war?

This is based on the assumption that it will, which is highly unlikely.

&gt; Also, citation needed on that ""funding both sides"" bit. 

http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/watercooler/2012/sep/13/picket-us-taxpayer-funded-taliban-retaliate-agains/

&gt; Even if you should be able to produce such a citation, the fact remains that the US is losing both wars to cavemen with primitive arms.

Simply not true. People think all the Taliban do is run around with a few AK-47s and that's the reason that they're alive.

&gt; A historical fact is not an anecdote. And no, I'm using that event to demonstrate that gun regulation cannot make homicide ""extinct"". I'm using it to demonstrate **that it is utterly useless against a determined individual**.

And we're back to the ""it would happen anyway!"" argument. Let's give nukes to everyone, because, after all, people will find ways to kill each other anyway. La dee da..

&gt; When the modern record-holder for spree kills did his deed in a society that severely limits gun ownership, it completely destroys the argument that gun control will prevent such things.

I'm glad you didn't bother to read the research I cited and are continuing to vomit the ""it would've happened anyway!"" nonsense.

&gt; As someone that apparently likes calling out fallacies, I encourage you to educate yourself on the definition of ""strawman"".

You attacked an argument that does not exist. This is an obvious strawman. Your entire argument revolves around the ridiculous ""it would've happened anyway!"" argument despite the fact that no one is stating how regulation makes gun homicides etc go to zero.

&gt; The worldview that believes gun control will prevent massacres. The worldview that thinks that somehow its opinion on the domestic policy of another nation is relevant. The worldview that wishes to impose its tyranny on humanity, but is hindered by guns and individual rights.

It's not a world view if it's backed up by tonnes of research. But hey, ignore it at your peril. I'm glad you would willingly let others die for your ideology.

&gt; To invalid inputs. 

To completely valid inputs. *You claim* that it would happen anyway. Following *your logic*, murder should be legalised because people kill regardless of what the law is.

&gt; If I sank to rhetorical tactics such as yours I'm sure I would compare your positions to advocating murder and rape.

Looks like you're just making things up at this point. How would me advocating gun regulation relate to murder and rape, then?

&gt; But I don't need to delve to such depths since I have logic and reality in my court.

But we can still leave the EU. And the EU / EEC was always going to develop and whilst we were *in* the EU these developments weren't hidden (from the government). We didn't get a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty when we should have (though the Irish Referendum perhaps shows how useless a gesture the referendum would have been anyway).

Different architecture styles from different periods (under the Bourbons, the Hapsburgs, the hideous messes built under Franco), monuments, and museums are usually best enjoyed (not overlooked) with a little context.

**Do Bring:**
* Good-quality walking shoes, preferably in a solid, dark color. Something like Aerosoles or Clarks.
* For clothes, go with flexible, basic pieces that can be worn in many combinations. This will cut down on your luggage and storage needs. Also, Madrid has lots of great shopping, so keep in mind that you can buy something if you need more variety. Also, don't wear gym shorts, track pants, sweatpants, etc., unless you are out running. Put jeans or slacks on for class, runs to the grocery store, etc.
* Any prescriptions or standard-issue over-the-counter stuff (cold medicine, tylenol, whatever). This can be a little tricky to get, especially if you have dicey insurance or have shaky language skills.
* A sturdy backpack or messenger bag to use for weekend trips, so you don't have to haul your big luggage around.

**Don't Bring:**
* Flip-flops or loud-colored sneakers, which generally identifies you as a tourist. 
* Hair dryer/straightener/other small grooming appliances. Just buy one when you get there, it's not worth it to buy a transformer and adaptor for every single thing.
* Lots of stuff. Space is at a premium in most flats, so having extra stuff to squeeze in is just going to make things difficult. Travel light!

**Visit:**
* Museums!- The Prado, The Reina Sofia, even the extremely corny Museo de Cera (wax museum). Beautiful and interesting, and you get a student discount.
* Chueca - totally fun neighborhood for restaurants, bars, even fetish shops. A traditionally gay area, but now it's just sort of everybody.
* Goya- fancy shopping for the nobles.
* Parque Retiro- huge, beautiful park in the middle of the city. I highly recommend renting a rowboat and paddling around the pond.
* As others have suggested, walking is a great way to get to know the city, and a good way to stumble upon restaurants/bars/stores that you might not see otherwise. However, I strongly recommend getting a metro pass as well, for errands and commuting. You can also use this as a way to explore the city.
* Side trips: Toledo, Segovia, [Valle de los Caidos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valle_de_los_Ca%C3%ADdos), the last of which is one of the creepiest places I have ever been.

**Don't Visit:**
* McDonald's/Burger King/KFC/Starbucks- Skip the American fast food! You will find something better, healthier, and almost certainly cheaper if you go to a real cafe.

Yes, I'm sure Anders Brevik would have abandoned his quest for guns and blood if he had been properly restricted.

A) If the US was the gun-free utopia you desire he would have gotten the ammo elsewhere or made it himself. B) You've produced no peer-reviewed papers.

Spree killings are highly unlikely, yet you wish to push your agenda according to their conduct.

Hold up here, because this is hilarious. You seriously think that a film made by an individual in the United States was funded and sanctioned by the government? That some shadowy US government organization was responsible for it? That you're as stupid as the Taliban?

&gt;Simply not true. People think all the Taliban do is run around with a few AK-47s and that's the reason that they're alive.

No, they're alive and winning because their form of guerrilla warfare is insanely effective against the US military, a lesson civilians can't help but learn.

&gt;And we're back to the ""it would happen anyway!"" argument. Let's give nukes to everyone, because, after all, people will find ways to kill each other anyway. La dee da..

Strawman.

&gt;You attacked an argument that does not exist. This is an obvious strawman. Your entire argument revolves around the ridiculous ""it would've happened anyway!"" argument despite the fact that no one is stating how regulation makes gun homicides etc go to zero.

More strawmen. And your argument revolves around ""it wouldn't have happened if we'd done X"".

&gt;It's not a world view if it's backed up by tonnes of research.

Which you've alluded to but never produced.

&gt;I'm glad you would willingly let others die for your ideology.

And I'm glad you'd willingly let others succumb to tyranny for your ideology. 

&gt;To completely valid inputs. You claim that it would happen anyway. Following your logic, murder should be legalised because people kill regardless of what the law is.

No, this is just an example of you failing to comprehend my arguments. Demonstrate how gun ownership is equal to murder.

&gt;Looks like you're just making things up at this point. How would me advocating gun regulation relate to murder and rape, then?

You're willing to twist my words in some childish effort to argue that I advocate murder. Why not rape? Come on, if you're going to be a disingenuous cunt follow through.

true,theozoph,IDF,Ile-de-France,"&gt; Quel constat? Comparer la vie avant l'industrialisation et après? Retourne vivre en 1750 si tu préfères...

Le constat que les conditions de vie et de travail du petit peuple se sont dégradés sous les régimes libéraux au XIX^ème siècle, et qu'elles ne se sont améliorées qu'en sortant de cette logique, à la fin du XIX^ème comme au sortir de la guerre 39-45 avec le programme du CNR.

Et franchement ton conseil, c'est le niveau zéro de l'argumentation.

&gt; Je ne vais pas réexpliquer.

Revenons sur tes contributions :

&gt;&gt;Sauf qu'on vit mieux maintenant qu'avant le capitalisme et la révolution industrielle. Et qu'avec la mécanisation du travail les conditions de vie des ouvriers se sont améliorés.

Deux affirmations sans démonstration. La première fait un lien causal qu'elle ne démontre pas et  se contente de nous dire qu'on vit mieux qu'il y a deux siècles. Au XVIII^ème, au vivait aussi mieux qu'au XVI^ème, tu sais? Ça s'appelle le progrès. La seconde est fausse car les conditions de travail des ouvriers se sont améliorés grâce aux combats sociaux, aux normes de sécurité et au droit du travail et non grâce aux machines, lesquelles ne sont objectivement responsables que d'un accroissement de la productivité.

&gt;&gt; C'est un constat. Avec l'apparition du capitalisme le niveau de vie des hommes a augmenté d'une façon inédite. Augmentation de l'espérance de vie, développement de nouvelles technologies, amélioration des conditions de vie des plus pauvres...

Encore une fois, tu ne démontres pas le lien causal entre un système économique et ses prétendus bienfaits. L'augmentation de l'espérance de vie vient des avancées de la médecine et de l'hygiène, les nouvelles technologies naissent des percées scientifiques qui se moquent bien de savoir comment est organisé le marché, et l'amélioration des conditions de vie des plus pauvres sont le résultats d'une meilleure redistribution des richesses créés par la mécanisation. D'ailleurs, maintenant que le pendule part de l'autre côté, le niveau de vie des occidentaux baisse.

Enfin, continuons, tu as au moins un argument qui ressemble à quelque chose dans ton dernier commentaire.

&gt; Ces améliorations ont été rendues possibles par l'enrichissement global de la société. Sans machines, pas de gains de productivité, pas d'argent en plus, pas d'amélioration possible.

Effectivement, sans création de richesse, pas d'amélioration du niveau de vie. Cela dit dans ton argument je vois des machines, mais pas de libéralisme... Et je viens d'expliquer que le progrès scientifique ne dépend pas du système économique. Après tout, les russes ont longtemps devancés l'Amérique dans ce domaine (Spoutnik, Gagarine). Ironie de l'histoire, c'est au prix **d'un effort de l'Etat fédéral** que ce retard à été rattrapé. Ah oui, l'interventionnisme c'est vraiment le mal absolu.

&gt; Ah, la Russie communiste, paradis des libertés, du progrès...

Devançons le contre-argument, je ne défend pas le système communiste, j'indique seulement qu'il est la preuve qu'on peut s'industrialiser, faire de la recherche scientifique et améliorer le niveau de vie de sa population sans libéralisme. On peut certainement faire mieux, mais rien n'indique que le libéralisme tous azimuts soit la panacée que tu prétends.

&gt; (avec un dictateur en roue libre... tellement libéral qu'il avait nationalisé toute l'industrie).

Et qu'il avait résorbé un chômage de 6 millions de sans-emplois en 3 ans (33-36) par un programme de grands travaux (l'Autobahn, Volkswagen, etc.) dans une économie ravagée par les réparations de 14-18 et une dette catastrophique (qu'il résorbera aussi), la transformant en une puissance industrielle sans pareille en Europe, et bientôt en une puissance militaire qui mettrait le reste de l'Europe à genoux. Mince alors, c'est vraiment nul, l'interventionnisme économique!

Je pourrais continuer avec le Japon de l'ère Meiji, ou l'Angleterre coloniale et son protectionnisme, mais bon l'argument reste toujours le même: en macro-économie, l'intervention de l'Etat permet de résoudre les déséquilibres conjoncturels ou structurels qu'un laissez-faire libéral ne peut résoudre.

Tu me prends pour un Stalinien, mais en fait je suis pour un libéralisme des petits entrepreneurs, et un interventionnisme patriote au niveau étatique. On protège son marché, on développe ses infrastructures, on établit une politique industrielle et agronomique saine afin de pouvoir vivre sans devoir de compte aux voisins, et on prend soin des plus faibles. Bref on gouverne dans l'intérêt du peuple (qui comprend les petits entrepreneurs, figure-toi), et non de la ploutocratie vivant de ses rentes. Le libéralisme n'est que la feuille de vigne derrière laquelle s'abritent les grands patrons du MEDEF, et comme théorie elle est incapable de résoudre les grands problèmes d'un marché international.

It all boils down to caffes that are all the same, folk clubs that are annoying and, if you like sports, football. In Zagreb there's some choice, but if you don't like football, you'll end up in a small community where everyone knows everyone, and you'll rarely meet someone who likes similar stuff like you outside of that small group.

Ad essere sincero trovo che *questo* test sia  di per sè sbagliato: cosa bisogna pensare di un/a insegnante che non lo passa dopo aver insegnato per anni (anche se precario)? Che non era all'altezza nonostante l'abilitazione? 

Non mi aspetto che la tenera e svampita professoressa di filosofia sappia usare un pc (in classe si trova sempre uno studente capace di far partire le slide): vorrei un test che sia tagliato sulla materia che si insegna, non uno generico in cui si valutino le capacità logiche che, diciamocelo, daranno pure un giudizio sulla supposta qualità di astrazione, ma non è indispensabile per tenere una buona lezione sui presocratici o Marcuse. Perché fare domande di lingua straniera se si insegna tutt'altro?

A questo punto per scremare i professori si poteva usare uno strumento più comodo, veloce, economico e solo leggermente più arbitrario: un bel sorteggione. 

Ma la scarsissima considerazione di cui godono gli insegnanti si è vista nella proposta di allungare di un terzo, a parità di stipendio, l'orario di insegnamento frontale. 

Con questo non voglio discolpare i professori che effettivamente non sono adatti, ma sono tratti che non possono essere valutati con un test simile. In Germania gli aspiranti professori vengono valutati da un panel di altri docenti e psicologi della formazione: questo mi pare il metodo giusto.

Avevo un professore ex(?) alcolista, ora relapso, che pur avendo una cultura sterminata doveva essere tenuto lontano dalla cattedra perché incline a esplosioni di rabbia con bocca schiumante.

Nel frattempo, non sottovalutare il quizzone. Se uno non capisce come è strutturato questo test e come sbilanciare le probabilità a proprio favore, non sarà _mai_ in grado di preparare un test a risposta multipla decente. Vedi l'esempio che ho fatto [qui](http://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/151olh/classico_rant_allitaliana/c7ikyvj?context=1). E lo dico per esperienza, sia come insegnante (ho tenuto un paio di corsi a una facoltà di informatica), sia perché ho provato a farlo online (e sono riuscito a fare 47 risposte esatte su 50 in 15 minuti, quindi tanto difficile non era).

Sì, ci sono domande del cavolo. Ma come puoi pretendere che i tuoi studenti mantengano la concentrazione in un compitino di latino se non sai farlo tu per primo?

Tra l'altro, a me sono sempre stati sulle balle i miei compagni che non studiavano matematica ""perché tanto non serve a niente"".

This is expensive due to the fact that each company has to deal with the same paperwork, and is further amplified by the fact that it really does require a lot of paperwork to run a company in Spain.

Both of these factors (most of the workforce employed in small businesses and a relatively heavy burden of bureaucracy) are incidentally shared by other European nations with notoriously low productivity (Greece, Italy, etc.), but not by nations with high productivity (Scandinavia, Germany, UK, etc.).

I don't know how it was called then, but after WWII, with the communist regime, religion was frowned upon, and a few decades after outlawed altogether. The figure that remained was connected to the New Year. The name I have been taught was Grandfather of the New Year (Babagjyshi i Vitit te Ri), which is funny, since, in all children's shows, a Santa-like old man represented the year that was about to end, and was soon followed by a 5-6 year old kid dressed as Santa who was called the New Year.

After the 1990s, the New Years figure was ditched, and due to the ongoing influence from the Italian TV media, Babbo Natale is a name anyone can relate to, and is often used in informal conversation. However, when it comes to the politically-correct naming, since the majority of the population is Muslim, the name has been reduced to just The Grandfather (Babagjyshi).

But at the moment the eurozone is making it worse.

The numbers could not be simpler nor more readily accessible.

Between 2008 and 2012, Greek government debt has risen from 105% of GDP to 170% of GDP.

Italian Government debt has gone from 103% to 118%.

For Spain it's from 36% to 69%.  

For Portugal it's from 68% to 108%.

It's all just getting worse and if you look at the charts, there is no reasonable basis to say the debt corner is about to be turned.

http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/government-debt-to-gdp

From 2009 - 2012, Greek GDP has contracted by c. 14%.

Italian GDP by c. 4%.

Spanish GDP by c. 6%. 

Portugese by c. 5%, which may just be trending out of slump.

You can find these charts at tradingeconomics.com

So the way things are, the debt crisis is going to outlast the current eurozone because the debts just keep getting bigger, while the money made to pay them by the people that incur them, shrinks.

The eurozone remains intact and is still breathing but treading this water it is drowning not waving, drowning maybe slowly but drowning nonetheless.

&gt;China's coming along rapidly, as is your own new home nation

But, for ""coming along rapidly"", you also have to read - becoming increasingly unequal, throwing more and more into destitution, inflating local prices way way beyond any regional impact on wages - especially as regards property, driving small business people out of the cities and small landowners off their land, favouring transnational corporate interests over local ones, breaking up families, increasing drug dependency/corruption, etc.  If you think ""globalisation"" is benign, then you've never lived in a country being globalised.  It works for some, but it destroys the majority.

&gt;No, but I hope they're male, because maybe that'll make up for the fact that they murder 1 in 10 baby girls at birth.

I'd need to research this, but I think both of us would concur, male abuse of powerless women and children needs to be crushed resolutely - preferably by women and children, I'll provide the necessaries!

There are some particularities : Christmas is the time for special treats : *papillotes*, which are chocolates or fruit pastes (*pâtes de fruits*) in a fancy wrapping. We also have [Christmas markets](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xv9nkt_strasbourg-capitale-de-noel-2012_travel) which can last several weeks ; you can buy every kind of sweets, pastries, handmade stuff, Christmas-related items, and of course *Vin chaud* (mulled wine) ! Most cities also have a huge Christmas tree on the central town square. And the 25th December is a public holiday o/


I live in Alsace (the area near the German border) and Christmas is kind of a big deal here (many many tourists come for the Christmas Market in Strasbourg, in an already touristic area), so maybe it's different in the South of France !

edit: almost forgot Saint Nicolas ! I'll have to paste the wiki because I'm in a rush, but it's very well explained, better than what I could have done


&gt;St. Nicolas comes primarily in Alsace, Nord-Pas-de-Calais (French Flanders), and in Lorraine, where he is patron. A little donkey carries baskets filled with children's gifts, biscuits and sweets. The whole family gets ready for the saint's arrival on 6 December, with grandparents telling stories of the saint. The most popular one (also the subject of a popular French children's song) is of three children who wandered away and got lost. Cold and hungry, a wicked butcher lured them into his shop where he killed them and salted them away in a large tub. Through St. Nicolas' help the boys were revived and returned to their families, earning him a reputation as protector of children. The evil butcher followed St. Nicolas in penance ever since as Père Fouettard. In France, statues and paintings often portray this event, showing the saint with children in a barrel.
Bakeries and home kitchens are a hive of activity as spiced gingerbread biscuits and mannala (a brioche shaped like the saint) are baked. In schools, children learn songs and poems and create arts and crafts about St. Nicolas, while in nursery schools, a man portraying St. Nicolas gives away chocolates and sometimes little presents. He is sometimes accompanied by an actor playing Père Fouettard, who like his German counterpart Krampus, carries switches to threaten the children who fear he will advise St. Nicolas to pass them by on his gift-giving rounds.

Good shout, will try to have a gander (although as a student the word ""holiday"" is meaningless to me), but I was referring to the messing up of the middle east as a whole. I know Iraq's creation was squarely on us.

Pros: 

* The nightlife (there are rock clubs, pubs and every kind of entertainment you desire, the drinks are fucking cheap and even if you don't feel like going to a pub, you can just buy some wine and sit out in the parks - technically it's illegal, but the police doesn't give a shit as long as you remain civilized), 
* The density of the public transportation grid (you can get anywhere in a reasonable time),
* The girls - yeah, every country claims that their girls are the prettiest, but I didn't realize how utterly spoiled I was until I moved to the Netherlands,
* The weather. Summer is hot, winter is cold, autumn and spring are rainy. As they are supposed to be.

Cons:

* Traffic. Driving morale is essentially like in Italy with a dash of USA. Bicycles are hated.
* Politics. Everywhere. People can be extremely fanatical about it.
* The city is filthy. Even the tourist-frequented areas are pretty filthy and it only gets worse. And the buildings are covered by the gray sooth from the exhaust gasses. Every summer there's a smog alert or two (LA-type).
* Lack of affordable sport facilities. There's a free soft-surfaced (made of recycled tires) running track on the Margitsziget, but it's falling apart due to disrepair and the pools are expensive and usually crowded by pensioners (they get a deduction).
* Crime. I had to be aware, always. I stayed away from corners, dark spots, areas not covered by cameras, etc... and even then some people attempted to mug me.
* Europe's highest taxes. We work for the state until pretty much the middle of July.
* Corrupt politicians. Metro lines costing more per kilometer than the fucking LHC. *Renovating* a stretch of 160 km/h railroad costs more per kilometer than *building* 240 km/h railroad in Germany. The government is taking away money from education (the students are on the streets demonstrating right now) to stuff the pockets of the oligarchs, build unnecessary stadiums (for several times more than it would cost normally - one in the hometown of the PM. Which wouldn't be too obvious if said hometown was a big city - but it's a fucking village!), etc...

Maastricht, where I currently live:

Pros:

* Bike friendly. Bike lanes are pretty much only necessary on high-traffic roads, the drivers are used to cyclists so on low traffic roads they share the lane. I can cycle through the city without anyone trying to kill me, which was surprising initially. Bike racks are everywhere.
* Clean. No heroin needles, cigarette butts, dog shit, etc... on the streets and the sidewalks. Due to the low traffic the air and the buildings are much cleaner.
* People are friendly.
* Low crime. Bike theft is bad here due to the amount of bikes, but otherwise I'm not afraid even in the darkest corners of the city. Or maybe I'm just conditioned to the VIII. district of Budapest, who knows...

Con:

* Pretty much every popular nightlife spot is an ISO standard club. With the same 10-15 tracks playing over and over again. And I hate ISO standard clubs. Yeah, and beer is 2€/2dl. In Hungary you get 5 dl for that in clubs and 1l in some bars!
* Lack of trees. No, not weed, there are coffeeshops... but actual trees. I've never noticed this while living there, but Budapest is a very green city with trees growing on the sides of most main roads, even in the inner city. I miss them.
* The weather, especially now. You can choose: wind from North, strong, brings a lot of rain but not so cold or wind from the South, strong, dry but very cold. Sometimes the two follow each other, so it's cold *and* raining. And I haven't even started to talk about the occasional bouts of arctic and Siberian air.
* Barely any public transport. I never thought I would say this, but I miss the BKV (fellow Hungarians will understand why I never thought that I would say this).
* Restaurants are expensive. At least I had to practice cooking.",0,1355938608,null,0,1355961950,0,c7j4r45,t3_153uc4,t1_c7j4r45,t3_153uc4,null,1430718515,21,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,21

&gt;&gt;Denkt mal an die Zeiten, als für Kabarettisten ""es wird davon ausgegangen""

Du kannst dich gerne nach Aufnahmen bzw. Skripten der Lach- und Schießgesellschaft aus den späten 80ern umschauen, wo Henning Venske &amp; Co. dieses verbale Unding karikierten, zusammen mit ""außen vor"" und ähnlichen Scheußlichkeiten.    

""Vermuten"", ""annehmen"", ""glauben"" sind Alternativen.

Drei Wirte statt einem. Ein schiefes Bild wird gestelzt bemüht (wer geht denn da eigentlich von wo nach wo?), um einen einfachen Sachverhalt auszudrücken.

&gt;Wozu darauf bestehen einfordern in zwei Wörter aufzuteilen? 

Ich bestehe keineswegs darauf ""einfordern in zwei Worte aufzuteilen"". ""Fordern"" genügt vollkommen, die Vorsilbe ist schlicht überflüssig und fügt dem Verb keine Bedeutung zu, die es nicht schon für sich allein hätte. 

Beim ""anfordern"" hingegen gibt es so eine Änderung, hin zu ""bestellen"" oder ""ordern"".

&gt;Und wieso bietest du mit speichern und aufbewahren gleich zwei Alternativen für vorhalten 

""Vorhalten"" kann man jemandem etwas, Tadel zum Beispiel, oder eine Tüte für Seekrankheit. 

Warum soll das jetzt aber ein Synonym für ""speichern"" sein?

Hollande is certainly not inspiring, if anything he is an example of a politician relying so heavily on promising everything to everyone that in the end, he's not able to do anything for fear of losing a bunch of his electorate (see the alliance between right and far-left against the new budget...)

I have a feeling that most danes make terrible excuses for the slow-moving bureacracy we have because they have never experienced anything else. The foreigners have a point of comparison and that's why they seem so critical.

But some examples...

Are you a student? Applying for stuff like boligstøtte (financial support for low-income renters like students) is a royal pain in the ass.

The healthcare is system is also super bureaucratic and slow. In order to see a specialist you need to wait at least a month. This is because the system requires you to see your family doctor first who then refers you to a specialist to do further observations and he will then make an appointment for you with the person who is actually going to treat your ailment. It always takes at least two fucking weeks between these appointments; it's such a shitty system.

And udlændingestyrelsen (the ones who deal with foreigners in Denmark) is purposely made to be a Kafkaesque bureaucracy to keep out all the pesky foreigners. It's a kind of prison where you must show up before noon and then stay for maybe 6 hours with no guarantee that will you get to see one of the people at the desk (it's perpetually understaffed). If you leave to get lunch you aren't allowed back in the building.

Best: 

* Easy-going people
* Really really good looking girls
* Good fashion sense, high quality clothing and lots of options (at least if you're a girl, most definitely if you're a girl)
* Food's decent
* Best coffee, no doubt about it

Worst: 

* Tons of bureaucracy and paperwork involved if you want to do anything. You better be easy-going, cause whatever you want to do, you're not gonna do it fast
* Crappy internet providers (fiber is still a rare sight)
* Tiny streets combined with lots of cars makes for very shitty circulation within some cities
* Many of the really really good looking girls + lots of fashion options + advertisers selling vanity = spoiled, demanding women, and they somehow don't age all that well either...
* Taxes, VAT, etc, the usual shit

That's all I can think of for now.

He moved to small-towny Aarhus, rather than Copenhagen, apparently didn't do basic research like ""will my driver's licence be valid here?"", and crucially decided not to learn the language and didn't really make any friends here...mostly because he thought danes would think it perfectly natural to speak English all the time instead of Danish whenever they smell a foreigner in the vicinity. Languages don't work that way... even though Danes almost all speak passable English, it doesn't make it enjoyable or natural for them to completely switch to English.

I'm not sure what he thought was going to happen. He should have moved to Copenhagen, stopped thinking he was moving to Utopia and made some expat friends instead of thinking everybody would naturally accomodate him and speak English all the time. This is the case in any country where English is not the majority language, not just Denmark.

In our example, the UK and rest of europe don't hate the crap out of each other. Neither will be made to bow to the demands of the others, due to WTO rules.

true,ajuc,POLA,Poland,"In Poland we celebrate St. Nicholas (6th December kids find presents at morning under they pillows, sometimes Święty Mikołaj comes with presents), and 24th December (yes, the day before Christmass, there's huge feast with whole family, it starts at evening, and lasts untill 24:00, when everybody go to church). The feast is without meat, only fishes, soups, mushrooms, such things (cause it's fast until midnight), only after the mass you can eat meat and such. The most important food is usually carp (people buy a live carp and bring it home three or two days before Christmas Eve. It is kept one or two days in a bathtub, and then killed and prepared). Other traditional food is barszcz with mushroom filled ""uszka"" (sth like dumplings). There is custom to have in total 12 diffeent dishes, and to leave one empty place at the table for surprise guest. Another custom is to have a little hay under the tablecloth for luck, and to see family pets and household animals at midnight, they are supposed to speak to people if they aren't comfortable.

The feast starts with everybody taking blessed in church ""opłatek"" [Christmas wafer]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_wafer ), breaking it and dividing with each other kissing and wishing each other something nice (it's THE customary time in the year to forgive someone, too). Animals get different colored waffer in some regions (but you don't have to kiss them ;) ).

Everybody gets presents at Christmass eve, too, in my region it works such - kids are told to look out for the first star, in the meantime presents ""appear"" under the christmass tree, when somebody see the first star everybody can unpack their presents.

Who gives presents depends on region of Poland. In my region it's Santa Claus (Święty Mikołaj), in other it can be ""Gwiazdor"" (Starman), or Christ child.

Alcohol is only alowed after the midnight, too, as is singing the carol songs (but it depends on the family).",0,1355956822,null,0,1355957790,0,c7jagri,t3_153n4i,t1_c7jagri,t3_153n4i,null,1430721571,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,Ipsey,UNSA,United States of America,"Mostly it's been healthcare issues. I'm used to the American system, where I can just throw money at my problem until I get an answer or it goes away. 

I am a student, but I don't have to get financial support because I am married to a Dane. I did have a hard time understanding how SU worked, because I had to apply through a gymnasiet for one course and my academy for another SU when I first started. There was a lot of confusion with that.

I've had tons of trouble with the language school in my area and trying to get my exams processed. I took my test last week and I got an immediate result on my speaking test but I haven't heard on my written test. I passed my hearing and reading tests a month ago. This is the final test I need to complete my residency requirement, and my government sponsored period ends in April, so I'm super antsy about this. The response I've gotten from them was ""We don't know.""

Udlændingrestyrelsen has been nice, they just take a really, really long time, which has made me paranoid. I live in Esbjerg so I've never had to deal with them in person. 

Jobcenter assigned me to a job finding program that has twice sent me out to the muslim ghetto across town from where I live. And though I have absolutely nothing against muslims or ghettos (When I lived in the States, I lived and worked in close contact with both); it does make me feel that there's something of a 'one size fits all' approach to these sort of programs. 

Regarding schools - in the States, I worked in Pharmacy for five years. I don't want to move to Copenhagen for school, and the only healthcare school in town rejected me three times because my Danish wasn't good enough. The third time I applied they accepted my husband. I have since been accepted into a different program. I help him out with some of the subjects he takes in school. He tells me that I speak better Danish than some of the people that he goes to school with. 

Despite what it sounds like, I'm not really complaining - in the end, I think I'm happier with the program that I'm in now than with any of the other options that I would have been set up with otherwise. It's been an uphill climb to get where I am, and I've had to do a lot of navigating in a system I really don't understand and I don't have anyone to explain to me. But I really like where I'm at now, I like my teachers and my class mates, and the place where I live now. 

And above all, I **love** living in Denmark. I wouldn't trade living here for anywhere else in the world. I love the slower pace of life, and the hygge and the pølsevognen and the pebernødder and even the grinning old lady who insisted that it was TVENTY KRONERZ when I got a cola Christmas shopping this week (I guess she heard my accent).

I love that I ran into my mother in law shopping yesterday and she bought us a bag of chips and drove me home. I love that I walked to the store in the first place and it was completely dark at 4pm and I ran into our regular checkout girl and she smiled at me. I love that my best friend from school and her husband came over tonight and we made plans for midsummer and it's not even Christmas.

This place feels exactly like we're raised to believe small town America should be and it's *not even in the same hemisphere*. In the morning kids ride their bikes to school and there's a playground outside my garden and I have a garden (How cool is that?)!

I never said it was. I also haven't got a clue what liberal socialism is, as far as my knowledge of politicology goes, and it goes a very substantial end, it is not actually a thing.

&gt; They don't consider proletariat oppressed anymore

Considering my last point, let's assume you were talking about liberal-individualism instead: the proletariat is not the minority here, in fact, it's the majority. Especially in a democracy, so says the liberal-individualistic philosophy, you should fear the 'dumb majority', and protect the minorities (this includes not only the groups that you describe, but more importantly, it includes **the rich** who are also a minority in virtually any country in existence)

&gt; And the culprit of their alleged oppression aren't the rich, but the western civilization.

Considering that socialism itself is a product of western civilization, and it's offspring ideologies are very dominant in the vast majority of countries that we consider to be part of the western civilization, I have to dismiss this statement of yours in its entirety because it's absolutely nonsensical, because accepting it would mean that many people with socialist tendencies are now accusing themselves of being the oppressors of the people they are trying to liberate. 

The problem with your argument is not that there is no merit to anything you are saying (not saying there is, but just that it's not the main issue here), but that it is completely baseless. I don't think that you have ever read a book about the factual history and original philosophical verbalization of the political ideologies that we have inherited from the 19th century.

Pros: Nice scenery, generally nice weather (summers not too hot, winters not too cold, decent amount of sunshine), laid-back people, high standard of living, mostly safe (although there are areas which are pretty bad as far as safety goes), people are generally pretty friendly, economic situation isn't too bad compared to most Western countries (although we have many moving to Australia each year), religion doesn't interfere in daily life and politics.

Cons: Our cities can be pretty boring places with not much to do (compared to Europe or Australia), public transport systems are generally awful, isolation (you could see this as a good thing, but I would love to have easy and cheap access to other countries), and people here can sometimes be pretty closed-minded (although the country is generally progressive).",0,1355960667,null,0,false,0,c7jbm39,t3_153uc4,t1_c7jbm39,t3_153uc4,null,1430722074,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Oder vorsichtshalber gleich den Volltext, ich will dich ja nicht überfordern.

Ich  gehe davon aus...

Wenn ich sage, ""Ich gehe aus"",
dann ist mir daran wichtig,
wohin ich gehe, und nicht woher.

Wenn aber ein Politiker sagt ""Ich gehe aus"",
hält er es nicht für wichtig, wohin er ausgeht,
sondern wovon.

""Ich gehe davon aus"", sagt er,
aber er sagt nicht, wohin.
""Ich gehe davon aus, daß -, sagt er,
aber er sagt nicht, daß und wozu und mit wem er geht
und wohin.

""Ich gehe davon aus"", sagt er, ""daß man mich gewählt hat.
damit ich meine ganze Kraft dem Wohle des deutschen Volkes...""
und so weiter oder so ähnlich sagt er, daß er davon ausgeht,
also von da weg.

Er entfernt sich von dem, wovon er sagt, daß er davon ausgeht,
und geht irgendwohin, wo alles ganz anders sein muß,
denn sonst hätte er ja gleich dort bleiben können,
wovon er ausgegangen ist.

Aber obwohl sie pausenlos ausgehen,
sind sie doch alle immer noch da,
ohne daß von ihnen groß was ausgeht,
und wenn ihnen was ausgegangen ist,
dann der Verstand.

Und sowas geht - davon kann man ausgehen -
nie gut aus...

&gt;The Social Democratic Party's position has a theoretical base within Marxist revisionism. Its party program interchangeably calls their ideology democratic socialism, or social democracy. The party supports social welfare provision paid for from progressive taxation. The party supports a social corporatist economy involving the institutionalization of a social partnership system between capital and labour economic interest groups, with government oversight to resolve disputes between the two factions.[4] In recent times they have become strong supporters of feminism, equality of all kinds, and maintain a strong opposition to what they perceive as discrimination and racism.

true,ProcrastinationMan,EURO,European Union,"Funny how nothing in that bit says anything about the destruction of western civilization. For your information, the main reason why neomarxism differs from different forms of Marx's theories is because it's ***less*** radical than it's predecessor. It seeks to realize ideals *within* the framework of the modern liberal state, not to destroy it. 

Furthermore, social-democratism has in fact become more liberal over the years in many countries. The socialist approach to democracy used to only include social equality, not legal equality. That was an ideal of the liberal approach to democracy. Furthermore, the socialist approach to democracy was theorized around the idea that the voice of the majority is the only thing that matters, whereas the liberal approach focused on civil rights to protect the minorities from the oppression of the majority. So when you're saying that the EU is becoming more socialist because of anti-discrimination laws, you are actually saying the exact opposite of what is factually happening.

**edit: If you want to learn something about social-democratism in the post-WWII era, I recommend reading *Postwar* by *Tony Judt*.

   The feeling of powerlessness is kinda ingrained in a lot of populations, best example being Eastern Europe.

&gt;Really? Do you worry about defence a lot? Anywhere in Europe is protected by NATO. No one would attempt to attack it.

While NATO has existed it has always caused some concern in Western Europe.  Everyone, especially the French (The french fully joined NATO after the cold war, when this concern was no longer immediately relevant), believed that they would be turned into a battleground by it's largest, most influential and most isolated member, the USA, and collateral damage will be ignored when devising strategies. This belief has been confirmed recently by USA supported paramilitaries such as GLADIUS, which also brings memories of what the USA has done in Panama and Afghanistan, i can expand on this if you want.  NATO is still an american tool in many ways and it's effectiveness is also contested, especially very recently with the Lybian intervention. Also, the pushing of armament procurement  from USA companies is creating some dissatisfaction.

&gt;Are you saying that you want the rebuilding contracts to involve your country after the EU invades other countries? Sorry I'm a bit confused with this bit :)

I have given an example of recent agreements between the USA and several smaller countries, specifically I was thinking of New Zealand joining the Iraq war on agreement of allowing Fonterra to participate in the reconstruction. Such agreements made by the USA are fairly common, notably in E.Europe, where politicians are attempting to ease visa restrictions. This is not the only tool of soft power that the USA has used, others include aid money arm twisting in Africa and the political force with which it twisted the arm of several European countries into helping with extraordinary rendition. 

It can do so because of it's size and ability to effectively organize a cohesive foreign policy, dividing and conquering smaller states. The EU does not need to emulate these policies, it just needs to make the less effective by serving as a more effective negotiator though size of people represented and resources, much like a workers union.

Oh, look, he's invoking Begging the Question again.

&gt; B) You've produced no peer-reviewed papers.

&gt; Spree killings are highly unlikely, yet you wish to push your agenda according to their conduct.

Whoops, I forgot facts and reality had an agenda. I do apologise.

-_-

&gt; Hold up here, because this is hilarious. You seriously think that a film made by an individual in the United States was funded and sanctioned by the government? That some shadowy US government organization was responsible for it? That you're as stupid as the Taliban?

Read the fucking article. Aid isn't distributed very well so the Taliban gets billions. The US ends up funding both sides.

&gt; No, they're alive and winning because their form of guerrilla warfare is insanely effective against the US military, a lesson civilians can't help but learn.

The billions from the US help, too, obviously.

&gt; Strawman.

Accurate analysis. *You* keep on stating that it would've happened anyway. So why not give everyone nukes? After all, the nuke ""doesn't trigger itself""!

&gt; And your argument revolves around ""it wouldn't have happened if we'd done X"".

Because that's what the facts show.

&gt; And I'm glad you'd willingly let others succumb to tyranny for your ideology.

Oh, yeah, more stringent background checks and buy-back schemes sure as hell scream tyranny. Poor you.

&gt; No, this is just an example of you failing to comprehend my arguments. Demonstrate how gun ownership is equal to murder.

I didn't state it is. What I did state that your logic can also advocate for zero laws because the criminals ""break them anyway"".

&gt; You're willing to twist my words in some childish effort to argue that I advocate murder. Why not rape? Come on, if you're going to be a disingenuous cunt follow through.

I have never stated that you advocate murder. Try reading for once.

&gt; Debunked? Who debunked my argument? And, again, the fact that Anders Brevik murdered more than 100 people despite strict gun control is not an ""anecdote"", it's a fact inconvenient to your position.

Again, facts devastating to your cause can't merely be dismissed as ""anecdotes"". The Brevik is the spree killer with the highest body count is quite relevant to the discussion, as the overall effectiveness of gun control measures is relevant when considering whether they're worthwhile.

&gt;Oh, look, he's invoking Begging the Question again.

No, I'm undermining your notion that he'd have stopped had he not gotten ammo from the US.

&gt;Learn to read[1] .

You hadn't linked to that in previous comments, so I don't see how you get off being a cunt here. 

&gt;Read the fucking article. Aid isn't distributed very well so the Taliban gets billions. The US ends up funding both sides.

And that has nothing to do with the success or failure of a domestic revolution.

&gt;The billions from the US help, too, obviously.

Guess where those billions came from? The taxpayers that would be revolting.

&gt;Accurate analysis. You keep on stating that it would've happened anyway. So why not give everyone nukes? After all, the nuke ""doesn't trigger itself""!

Because nuclear weapons aren't guns. They're indiscriminate in who they kill. It's not possible for an individual to use them without harming others. 

&gt;Because that's what the facts show.

The facts show that spree killers still get their guns regardless of regulation.

&gt;I didn't state it is. What I did state that your logic can also advocate for zero laws because the criminals ""break them anyway"".

So you're still failing to understand this... No, I'm not. The crucial distinction here is that gun ownership doesn't inherently harm society. 

&gt;Using one example to base your whole argument is an anecdote. That's exactly what an anecdote is!

He's not the only spree killer in Europe, Australia, or any other area with strict gun control. It's not just one example of the failure of gun control, it's a series of failures across many nations and ethnic groups.

true,Enda169,null,null,"&gt; I can't quote the gesetz book, but there was a couple of days ago a report on these exact topics (handy, can't link) and this is the GEMA reform for 2013. The tax on hd's and USB? Fact. The charge per song? Fact as of 2013 (with an average of 1300 euro per dj per concert assuming 10k songs on hard disk as a reasonable dj's collection. I think I saw it on gemastoppen.DE).

First of all we are not talking about laws (or Gesetze) at all. The GEMA is a private company and their tarifs are not laws. The tax on harddisks, USB-drives and all other forms of storage media is correct. Although it is a fee, not a tax, but that's only a minor detail. You might notice, I didn't contest that. And you can argue about this fee and whether it's necessary. Personally I don't really mind it and it makes sense in a way.
The charge per song? Never heard of anything like this. Definitely can't find it anywhere in the official GEMA tarifs. I'd recommend to look up the fees directly in the official tarifs. Don't rely on some anti-GEMA website when you can easily find all the relevant information first hand. GEMA tarifs for clubs and events is based on things like number of dance-floors, size of venue, entrance fees, and so on. The number of songs on the harddrive or even the number of songs played doesn't come into it from what I can find in the official tarif guidelines.


&gt;The block unless contract was GEMA's answer to my question why I can't watch YouTube vids released by non-european artists. Sorry if I got anything wrong here, but from what I managed to find out these seem to be the facts. It is meaningless to say 'abolish GEMA '. It is a legal entity. Their control and business model is what needs to be abolished, not the executives. 

Block unless contract means youtube needs to have a contract with the GEMA. The artists already have one.
The way it works in Germany is, the content owners buy rights from artists to distribute music via CD, DVD, music downloads and so on. The GEMA then covers when the music is played somewhere in public. Radio stations, events, clubs or in this case youtube. They have an official ""catalogue"" where they have defined how much everyone has to pay for the license to play music. The major IT trade group in Germany has already signed contracts with the GEMA. Same as most other websites who wish to deliveer content. Only youtube is still refusing to even talk terms. This is less an issue about money and more about Google not wanting to appear as if they are delivering content. Googles stance is, that it's the individual uploader who provides content so each individual uploader should pay GEMA fees. Which in my opinion, is ridiculous, especially since youtube is the one providing the ads and therefor the revenue.


-----

Now all this doesn't mean that I agree with everything the GEMA does. I believe there are many things wrong with how the GEMA handles things. Most importantly the extreme bias in favor of high-earners the GEMA has. But that doesn't mean that the system of the GEMA itself (or the laws it is based on) should be abolished.",0,1355996500,null,0,false,0,c7jjgah,t3_153p0a,t1_c7jjgah,t1_c7jjahr,null,1430725893,0,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,0

[Pharmacies](http://sharpsburgpharmacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/PrescriptionAreaDropoff.jpg) tend to be larger on a whole, and tend to be a function of a larger store. 

A **drugstore**, which is like a small grocery store that sells makeup and a few perishable goods and candy and small, useful items, but primarily prescription medication and over the counter medication (which is usually out and readily available for people to pick and pay for at the normal registers, not at the pharmacist counter). A portion of this does get stolen, but most people just pay for it. 

Most **supermarkets** have pharmacies in them, which is what makes a supermarket different from a grocery store (some also do other things like tires and sell TVs, like Walmart, Costco, and Sam's). They also have over the counter products.

Over the counter medicines are cheaper in the States too, and easier to access, so if you wanted to, you could buy [25 bottles of cough syrup](http://www.violentacres.com/archives/193/what-would-happen-if-you-bought-25-bottles-of-nyquil/) and nobody would really care. You can also get them in [larger quantities](http://m.cvs.com/img?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cvs.com%2Fbizcontent%2Fmerchandising%2Fproductimages%2Flarge%2F5042816031.jpg&amp;ttl=30d). My parents send me a package one a year with all the medicines that I need because it costs them about $20 for the year and it can cost me upwards of 300 dkk every four months. 

On top of that, one of the medicated hand creams I use for my allergies is only available with a prescription. It's taken me three years to actually get a prescription for it, and it's .1% and the strength I get from the States and use on a daily basis is 1%, and comes with Aloe and lavender in it. 

One of the medications I use to treat my migranes, which I have taken to my neurologist and shown to them, is not available here at all. They just laugh at me and tell me to keep importing it from the States. One of the bulk sizes lasts me over two years, and costs $15. Or I could pay monthly for a prescription here. 

This, again, is not good or bad, it's just different. 

The flip side of this equation, is that my prescription medication for the stuff I super need to take, every day, or I stop breathing and I stop being able to function like an adult, is a fraction of what I was paying in the States. I paid over $3000 annually for my medical care, including medication, doctor visits and hospital stays, for issues related to epilepsy, migranes, asthma, and other conditions, and I was fortunate enough to have medical insurance. 

I pay *less* than 10% of that here in Denmark. The *only* thing I pay for is medication, whether over the counter, or by prescription (And Dental, but that's separate). That 10% is a fraction of the real costs associated with that medication, so even if my source in the states dried up, I'd still be satisfied with what I have and wouldn't be complaining.

By pure chance I had kept the receipt, and I called them to resolve the issue but they insisted that they had no records of me turning in the equipment.  I had to go in and show the receipt and the bastards immediately said, oh yes, we see you returned it. I think they just do it because people probably throw away the receipt and then is on the client to prove they returned it and if you don't have the receipt, you're fucked.

Poland has been homogeneous for a very long time now and many conservatives will fear this new direction and the challenges that come with it.

Even though historically Poland has been a land of many cultures and nationalities (up to WWII), this new wave of immigrants is something Poland has never experienced. Before the war, immigrants came from neighboring regions with traditions or languages similar to Poland's and conglomeration wasn't too difficult to handle. Today immigration for Eastern Europe also causes relatively little problems in this regard.

But immigration from distant lands will face a language barrier and a cultural barrier that'll be hard to adjust to. Polish is hard to learn and who knows how the general population will react to immigrants making mistakes. I hope most of the population will appreciate others trying to adjust and I hope we will help them out in the process.

true,Enda169,null,null,"&gt; This is the article I saw about the 'per song' fee. While obviously biased, I believe the basic facts are correct.

The facts in this article are definitely wrong. I unfortunately can't provide any english speaking links except the GEMA itself. All the fees can be found there. There is no pay per song to be found anywhere.
And when I consider your link also has this passage: ""It's unclear at this point whether GEMA is assessing this fee for each track played or each track on the hard drive. Considering its ""difficulty"" with accurately tracking music played, I would assume GEMA will opt for a levy on the contents of the drive, which will be less ""onerous"" and result in larger fee assessments."" This sounds very much like a biased source creating panic over nothing.

&gt; All I'm saying is that the current business model seems preposterous, convoluted and needs to be changed.

The GEMA only gets involved if you want to publicly play copyrighted music. They have nothing to do with you buying CDs or MP3s or anything like that. Their only job is to make sure artists are compensated when someone uses their music for his own events. It would be impossible to always track down each individual musician and make a deal with each one, so the GEMA was created to represent all musicians in these cases. They charge a fixed fee for music played to clubs, radio stations, events, and so on. And then distribute this income to all musicians on their roster, depending on how often their music has been played.

I think this is a very good system in theory, which allows radio stations or clubs to play music relatively hassle free while also ensuring that the musicians get paid. There is valid criticism against GEMA, mainly in the area of how they distribute the money and how high the fees are for certain cases. But that's not a problem of the system and only a problem with how it is set up.

----

&gt; I do not contest that creators should be compensated for their work. All I'm saying is that the current business model seems preposterous, convoluted and needs to be changed. I'd say this in regards to all media, not just music. I for example, pay a fee to a company that allows me access to media (t.v., music, movies) on a per-GB basis. This goes on top of my ISP bill. Sadly, this company does not have a way (or desire?) to compensate the creators, but I hope that in the future they would and I won't be considered 'pirating'

Now, basically what you are saying here is that you believe that creators should be compensated, but you don't really want to pay yourself. Maybe someone else can do that for you? Because what you do is nothing else but piracy. And it should always be called piracy. You and the company you pay both have many legal options to aquire media. A lot of very convenient and well working ones at that. You just don't want to pay a fair price and instead go with piracy.

If you would really care about creators getting a fair compensation, stop pirating. Otherwise you simply have no leg to stand on. Piracy is a lot worse then anything the GEMA does. At least they give some compensation to musicians. You chose to give them none at all.",0,1356009086,null,0,false,0,c7jkrt5,t3_153p0a,t1_c7jkrt5,t1_c7jk25k,null,1430726527,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

It's funny because on the one hand they tend to be the least-integrated immigrants of all, yet they rarely demand anything or cause any troubles.


So much this. I don't mind immigration at all when they work that hard. I don't care about integration then.

My girlfriend is of asian descent(her parents fled from war). She's never had a problem with getting jobs, being accepted, etc. Her parents worked their ass off, and now they, alongside with all other asian immigrants coming from that war, are doing very well, living in big houses, good jobs, etc.

You could ask yourself if we're really *that racist* in Scandinavia/nothern Europe; Or the problem lies with the immigrants who blame everyone else? Namely, middle eastern/african immigrants.

Too bad we took too many from the wrong cultures in here..
