true,bunburya,IREL,Hibernia,"&gt; the newspapers don't seem too interested.

I think this is a large part of the problem; so often the EU gets blamed for failing to communicate with the people, but effective communication requires third parties like the media, and citizens themselves, to take some form of an interest in its doings. This rarely happens. I think a large part of it is that the newspapers (many of which, the trashier ones at least, have a pronounced anti-EU agenda themselves) are much more willing to report on negative things about the EU than positive things, or even to put a negative slant on things which could really be considered neutral or positive. Either way, they rarely give the full side of the story. I bet the next article you see in the Telegraph or the Daily Express bitching about the lack of transparency in the EU won't link to this portal.

A TV station might be a good idea, but some people would criticise it as being propaganda no matter how objective it sought to be, and then you have to ask who would watch it. Perhaps more of an effort could be made to promote awareness of the EU through the education system. In Ireland we take a class called Civil, Social and Political Education which is supposed to touch on the basics of the EU but it is far from adequate. For one, it is only taught from approximately ages 13-15, and the exam in it is never considered for college applications or anything. The exam is pitifully easy, leading it to be perceived as a joke class by students. Teachers who teach it are usually not specialised in it or any connected area. And it only touches on the very basics of the EU, not really making any effort to impress upon students just how important it is.

I have always thought we should have a better, more serious political and social education in schools which would focus strongly on the EU.",0,1356541592,null,0,1356546682,0,c7md73v,t3_15gwwl,t1_c7md73v,t1_c7mckxo,null,1430774874,26,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,26

This didn't help of course cause people didn't want to move to the poorest province in the country, but the official policy could blame it on the Albanians.

Similar policies existed after Kosovo was conquered by Serbia in 1912. Recently I was listening to discussion on a Serbian radio station about the atrocities committed against the Albanian population during the Balkan wars and how those atrocities started the hatred which exists till today. If you're interested I might find the radio show for you (it's in Serbian).

On the other hand, the Albanians didn't systematically colonize Kosovo, they just outgrew the Serbs through the centuries. The Serbs moved north, into what is now Vojvodina (where today you have many non-Serb place names and cultural remains), and left their homes in the south. Not because they were somehow forced to do so, but because the north was always richer, had better quality land etc.

The registrar is annoying because you can only get that done in a few venues (has to be approved and tasteful &amp; can't be outside, limitations on what you can say during the ceremony) and the civil servants only work 9-5 Mon-Friday.

Humanist groups couldn't do weddings because they wouldn't count as ""religious"". They've changed the law to make it less strict so semi-philosopical groups can qualify now.

It is simply not worth making such expensive films only in German.

I don't so much think that it is a double standard. As you pointed out, the USA is a huge country, and as such it can take in and enjoy foreign culture without being threatened by it. Smaller countries can be overwhelmed. 

When I was growing up most of what I watched was American TV (Friends, Frasier, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly etc) and childrens TV is very much the same (Rugrats, Kenan and Kel, Spongebob, Recess, Saved by the Bell and Fairly Odd Parents all being American I believe). Doctor Who, Coupling and Red Dwarf are some of the only British TV I recall watching a significant amount of (there's no doubt a lot more but I don't watch a huge amount of TV). This doesn't even mention the movies and games (especially now Japan seems to be losing a bit of grip on the gaming industry). It's no doubt the same with books as well (though Harry Potter is of course English and a lot of authors I read are Canadian).

For myself I'm not complaining (and am happy the UK and US speak the same language) but I can see how it could overwhelm and be a cause for concern. As long as you keep American politics (and [Piers Morgan](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/keep-piers-morgan-usa/cbpHr9R2?utm_source=wh.gov&amp;utm_medium=shorturl&amp;utm_campaign=shorturl)) on your side of the ocean I'm happy.

true,MadManWithTinFoil,BAVA,Bavaria,"&gt; they effectively devalued their currency,

with a currency worth twice as much as the DM. 
Our DM was never worth more than the Dollar. 
And you will surely claim that the DM would now be worth more than the Euro on its own.

In return I am going to ask you why the Euro was worth more than the DM in the first place? 
I don't think the value of a currencies is calculated the way most people think it is. 

On a sidenote, with a stronger currency we would not only strengthen our domestic market  (you know we Germans actually could afford to buy all those nice things) we could also import more cheaply, which is also important for our Export.
Mostly because we don't export things which grown on trees, and need a lot of raw materials and energy product.
 And that would lower the cost our products. 


Back in the Days when the € was worth around 1,6$ people here were concerned that the € could be become so expensive that it could hurt our exports.

During that time I read a study where they came to the conclusion that our corporations wouldn't have a problem if the € would be worth up to 30% more. They used the reasoning I tried to describe above.
Sadly I can't find the study right now, than again I don't know if you would be interested in a German study.

I also want to add that there is a problem with your assumption that German goods are competitive because of the Euro. 
If this would be true, there wouldn't be a need to adjust our Economy with reforms under Schröder, the Euro would have done that for us.
But we all know that Germans had to go through the ""Agenda 2010"" reforms, which not only meant having a decade without pay rise, we also had to adjust our welfare programs.  


There are other reasons German corporations have benefited from the €.

And you could only propose such an argument because your country has never been invaded. So you don't understand the first thing about an invasion.

At least americans would have some idea of what it must be like for the innocent people on the other side.

America will never be invaded because it holds nuclear weapons not because you own ""firearms"".

Many Europeans speak English, but most Americans only speak English. Therefore European films find it difficult to penetrate deeply into America. If you wanted exposure to the full menu of European films, are you prepared to learn a second language? Or more realistically, a third and fourth and fifth? There are always sub titled films, but nevertheless, language is a very real barrier.

This is disingenuous. Most of the European population watches American films with subtitles or overdubbing. In fact, outside of special showings — or English-speaking countries — pretty much everyone does.

Europeans are more willing to watch American films with subtitles than to watch their own films. 

This is partly because Hollywood is very good at producing the video equivalent of donuts — something that subverts the brain's reward-incentive system in order to manipulate behavior in favor of a commercial product.

Yes — though this is intertwined with earlier history, when much of the Southwest was ultimately controlled from Madrid.

However, today I think the USA's general receptiveness to immigration is a major factor. In many parts of the country Mexicans are thinner on the ground than Central Americans, who have also been arriving in large numbers for decades. 

Of course the fact that they share a common language with each other and with Mexicans makes it possible to achieve a linguistic critical mass that immigrants from, say, Asia can't.

Italy can then take on the Lira currency in the meantime like Spain and Greece will as they all exit the Eurozone from January 1st 2013 onwards.

It is time the Jesuit run fascist and Marxist dictatorship European Union crumbled into the fiery pit it once arose from. Note the front puppets of the European Union are all connected to the Papacy.

What about their connection to the giga-wealthy Pallavicini family? A family who were funding wars into the millions of monies centuries ago and long before any Rothschild family.

The timing of the attacks on Silvio Berlusconi were interesting considering the invasion and destruction of his friend, Muammar Gaddafi. Muammar Gaddafi would have destroyed The Worshipful Company of Mercers and their financial system if his wonderful Golden Oil Plan had come into play. You have to wonder why they feared Berlusconi so much back then and continue to try to smear him daily as they have done with Dominique Strauss-Kahn and others lately. Notice how they purposely slaughtered Muammar Gaddafi in their third public live snuff movie broadcast for all to see. This was to put the warnings out to anyone who dared to execute economic warfare (real warfare) on the City of London Corporation and King Juan Carlos of Spain. The first live snuff film was the 9/11 attacks by GAPAN, UK Ministry of Defence, NATO, Royal Canadian Air Force, Bombardier Master Trust and The Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath. The second was the hanging of the man they claimed was Saddam Hussein (they reported his death three years prior to the hanging).

Then read their citations.

&gt; None of which provide the information I seek or that you base your argument on.

The first one provides a list of the worst mass shootings in the last fifty years, the second provides a map of where they took place, and the last provides details on weaponry and whether they were acquired legally or illegally. By all accounts, that's exactly what MotherJones reported on.

&gt; Past experience reading its content. The general admission of its contributors. The consensus of pretty much everyone on the Internet. It's a lefty rag.

That doesn't automatically make it biased. Faux is right-wing but dismissing them based on solely them being Faux is a dangerous game to play. Evidence should trump everything.

&gt; Yes, but it hasn't targeted US citizens until recently. And at any rate the whole ""War on Terror"" is further evidence of my argument that the general level of tyranny is increasing.

I always saw it as feigned incompetence myself. The military contractors hold quite a bit of sway in the political realm so going to war is to be expected. It's a little depressing. Britain has similar problems in that regard.

&gt; Knowledge is actually less powerful than high explosives delivered in the form of a missile. Trite aphorisms aren't necessarily true.

Not psychically, but imagine what would happen to those in power if everyone was aware of what happened to Anwar-Al-Awlaki.

&gt; So this is you admitting you're intentional misinterpreting what I've written and have been bashing a strawman?

No, this is me writing that you deem all of gun control a failure based on what you have written. If you mean regulation x or y is a failure, then feel free to say so.

&gt; In a country of 300,000,000 people it is.

Even then it isn't. The death of the innocent alone dwarfs that when compared with the total gun homicide rates of other countries. I'm assuming you're not a sociopath so you do care about those people, don't you?

&gt; Which also didn't provide the information I require.

You asked for the breakdown and it has been provided across multiple sources. At this point you're choosing not to ""believe"" it.

&gt; Which are also impossible to directly compare due to the geographical burden of the war on drugs.

Except for the fact that none of the violence is present in the US due to the drug war. You can make that argument for, say, Mexico, but not for the US.

&gt; Private gun ownership is, for all intents and purposes, banned in those countries. That limitation of personal ownership is kind of what your argument hinges on, after all.

No, it's not banned, and no, limiting ownership outright is different than limiting ownership only to those who need it. The frame here is with the latter.

&gt; And people have never resorted to desperate means to acquiring guns. 

Irrelevant. Most gun homicides are crimes of passion.

&gt; If you're going to make your argument from the perspective of lives saved at least be consistent here: guns, alcohol, tobacco, cars, fast food, and skydiving should all be banned.

Except that I haven't written about banning anything. Try a better strawman next time.

&gt; Now you pathetically confused or pathetically disingenuous. Our argument over the meaning of ""often"" is quite separate from the argument in which you attempted to conjoin bits of separate paragraphs of one of my responses into a new sentence I never wrote.
&gt; This is where you attempted to conjoin two separate bits of what I wrote into one sentence, liar.

Good job on confirming your illiteracy. You wrote what I quoted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14wlp6/reading_about_the_conneticut_massacre_as_a/c7lg3xi);

&gt; Yet still not anything close to ""often"", given the number of guns and incidence of ownership.

I quoted this as;

&gt; Yet still not anything close to ""often"",
&gt;  given the number of guns and incidence of ownership.

Either you're illiterate or you're a lying sack of shit. Which is it?

&gt; That Mother Jones is a biased rag is not something I just made up. I would have similar suspicions of any study commissioned by Fox News or other such organizations.

Being suspicious is fine, but claiming they're biased based on your suspicion alone is not.

&gt; And crimes of passion can only be committed with guns. Ok...

They can't, but if all you have around is a spatula then no one is going to die.

&gt; Of course they would be. The only thing the lack of guns could prevent would be mass shootings, 

Mass shootings actually are linked more with mental health, gun control is supposed to quell the majority of one-off shootings.

&gt; which still happen in countries with strict gun control. Therefore, gun control does almost nothing to prevent violent crime.

Are you trying to sound stupid now? No one claims that gun control would bring down crime to zero.

&gt; It isn't. 

Sweet.

&gt; But for some reason you think this cancels the argument over the discriminatory nature of the weapons in question. It doesn't. A nuclear weapon, even used responsibly, will kill innocent bystanders and cause significant environmental trouble. Guns don't have either of these properties.

The only time guns don't hold these properties is if the only people around are the people meant to get shot, and since that only happens in places where very few people live, this would affect most people regardless.

You think it doesn't matter? Well, you're wrong. Four-hundred Dutch Peacekeepers stood by and didn't do shit when innocents were massacred in front of them in Bosnia (prompting America's entry). When Kuwait was invaded (we get most our own oil from Canada), we stepped in to defend them. 

And don't say we created these problems. We didn't. The British Empire, and Europe in general, did when they annexed, and then partitioned, the Middle East and Africa. We are only inheriting it and keeping the status quo so the mess ya'll made doesn't spill over too much.

I was very surprised when rattling through my Michel Thomas French tapes for the n'th time, repetition being for me the core to language learning and Michel started going on about how ""sentir"" doesn't in a meaningful way contain the English concept of ""feel"".

Not convinced, when I got the chance, I asked as ten year old kid who is completely bi-lingual and whose first language is French how one would say, in French,

""I feel it would be a good idea to ...""

And without a second's hesitation he plonked for ""je pense.""

I suppose he should have done because Michel Thomas is only about the most successful language teacher ever and he was French - so I suppose he should know. 

It struck me as a very interesting expression of the emphasis, perhaps excessive, the French are prone to place on intelectual analysis.

No, the debt has gotten a haircut. The private debt of Greece has been reduced by 50%, so the reckless private lenders have had to swallow their part already.

&gt;No, other countries tax payers are paying off their debt.

All the aid they have been getting is in the form of loans, not gifts.

&gt;Can you please tell me why Estonia's taxpayers, who are poorer than the Greeks and who should pay for the Greeks? Or are you saying that they are not? Why do Finland have to pay.

Because the benefits Estonia or Finland are getting from the Euro far, far outweigh the disadvantages.

&gt;And, are the Greeks now less corrupt than before? They are not number 80 on Transparency International Corruption list anymore? They have done the proper things, for example started to tax collection in the proper way? (For God's sake, most of it isn't even computirized, so you could have it ""fixed"" easier). Is that gone?

Their budget is under scrutiny 24/7. I think they're making the progress that is possible.

&gt;I know that, but, an gift towards HIV medicine there might still make a bigger difference, through the proper channels, than to complaining Greeks.

So population pressure rises again and triggers another war? It's never that easy. If the Greeks didn't get the loans, it would mostly be social services like healthcare that went on the chopping block, anyway.

true,derwisch,null,null,"Zum ersten Teil (bevor das mit den Auftragsforschungsinstituten kommt) ein paar Anmerkungen.

&gt;  Für viele Forscher ist die Unterzeichnung eines Vertrages Normalzustand, in dem sie sich verpflichten, die Ergebnisse geheim zu halten, bevor der Auftraggeber die Genehmigung zu Veröffentlichung erteilt. In einigen Verträgen behalten sich diese auch das Recht vor, die Studie zu jedem Zeitpunkt abbrechen zu dürfen. Auch den Studienteilnehmern, also den Patienten, steht oft nicht das Recht zu, die Ergebnisse einzusehen.

Arzneimittelstudien müssen vor Beginn nicht nur der zuständigen Ethikkommission, sondern auch den Behörden gegenüber angemeldet werden. 

&gt; In den meisten Fällen ist das Design so ausgelegt, dass das neue Arzneimittel seine Wirkung nur gegenüber einer Placebo-Pille und nicht gegenüber einem bereits auf dem Markt befindlichen Medikament beweisen muss. Dieses Vorgehen legt die Latte niedrig. 

Stimmt. Das führt zu mehr Konkurrenz im Markt. Dass ein Medikament zugelassen wird, heißt aber noch nicht, dass es erstattungsfähig ist. Hierfür ist eine Nutzen-Risiko-Abwägung im Vergleich mit dem bestehenden Markt gezeigt werden.

&gt; Dies ist gerade vor dem Hintergrund der Tatsache bedenklich, dass der Anteil der Placebo-Responder, also derjenigen Probanden, die auf einen Placebo positiv reagieren, aus noch nicht genau bekannten Gründen gerade bei den Psychopharmaka immer höher] wird.

Das verstehe ich nicht. Die Latte wird durch Ansprechen auf Placebo doch wieder höher.

&gt; Eine andere Variante ist es, zwar ein Konkurrenzprodukt zum Vergleich heranzuziehen, dieses aber in zu hoher oder niedriger Dosis zu verabreichen.

Habe ich noch nicht beobachtet, aber gut, kann es geben. Aber der Konkurrent hat auch eine Marketingabteilung.

&gt; Teilweise sind die Versuchsgruppen zu klein, um verallgemeinerbare Ergebnisse zu erhalten.

Verallgemeinerbarkeit und Gruppengröße hat erst einmal wenig miteinander zu tun. Zwanzig zufällig gezogene Namen aus dem Melderegister sind repräsentativer für die Gesamtbevölkerung als 2000 Diabetiker, die nur in Krankenhäusern der Maximalversorgung rekrutiert werden, für den Diabetes. Alles bis Phase III ist bezüglich der Verallgemeinerung höchst fragwürdig. Wirksamkeitsstudien haben zunächst das Ziel zu zeigen, dass das Zeug überhaupt wirkt.

&gt; Über die Auswahl der Teilnehmer werden die Ergebnisse präformatiert. Denn oft sind Studienteilnehmer gesünder als die späteren, realen Patienten, im Regelfall sind sie zudem mit weniger Begleiterkrankung belastet. Die Wirksamkeit der Testsubstanz stellt sich dadurch besser dar.

Vor allem wird dadurch die Variabilität verringert, wodurch die Trennschärfe der Studie steigt. Das führt auch zu einer Unterschätzung oder zur Blindheit gegenüber der Nebenwirkungen. Das war eines der großen Probleme beim [Vioxx-Skandal](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rofecoxib#Marktr.C3.BCcknahme).

&gt; Die primären Endpunkte (beispielsweise der komplette Rückgang der Erkrankung) werden nachträglich geändert. Eine Dateianalyse zeigt dies beispielsweise für das Antiepileptikum Gabapentin. Wie üblich war knapp die Hälfte der jemals durchgeführten klinischen Studien zu Gabapentin nie veröffentlicht worden. Für 12 veröffentlichte Studien überprüften die Autoren nun, ob die in den internen Dokumenten im Vorwege gesetzten Endpunkte mit den späteren übereinstimmten. Aber von den 21 genannten Endpunkten erschienen später nur elf. Sechs wurden ganz unter den Tisch fallen gelassen, weitere vier wurden plötzlich zu sekundären Endpunkten.

Das zu prüfen ist Sache der Behörden, die auch nach dem Verbleib von Daten der angemeldeten Studien  (siehe oben) fragen können.

&gt; Ein ähnliches Vorgehen attestierten Statistiker klinischen Studien schon 2004. Das Centre for Statistics in Medicine in Oxford nahm 102 klinische Studien unter die Lupe, deren Ergebnisse in 122 Fachmagazinartikeln veröffentlicht wurden. Über die Hälfte der Endpunkte war, glaubt man der Analyse, unzureichend wiedergegeben und fast zwei Drittel hatten im Verlauf ihren primären Endpunkt verändert. Mehrere Endpunkte werden so kombiniert, dass undeutlich ist, das ein vergleichsweise unwichtiger Endpunkt den größten Beitrag geleistet hat. Es werden mehrere Endpunkt gewählt, in der späteren Analyse werden aber nur die mit positiven Ergebnissen genannt.



Durch die Anmeldung der Studien (bestenfalls durch Publikation des Prüfplans) wird eine solche Erkenntnis erst möglich. 



&gt; Weil messbare und klar defininierte Endpunkte oftmals schwer zu erreichen sind, werden Ersatz-Messwerte (med. Surrogat-Marker) herangezogen, von denen ein Zusammenhang zu Krankheit vermutet oder aus früheren Untersuchungen als bewiesen gilt. Ein Beispiel hierfür ist die Verringerung der Chance von Herzinfarkten durch das Senken des Cholesterinwerts mit Hilfe von Statinen. Inzwischen reibt man sich an diversen, lange als gesichert geltenden Erkenntnissen, die durch Surrogat-Marker gewonnen wurde, denn es ist bekannt, dass ein statistischer Zusammenhang nicht unbedingt eine Kausalität anzeigt und zudem Ausbruch und Verlauf von Krankheiten von diversen Einflüssen abhängen.

Das ""correlation is not causation""-Argument verfängt hier nicht. Ein statistischer Zusammenhang zeigt eine Kausalität an, wenn die Behandlung randomisiert wurde. Dadurch wird (vorbehaltlich ""Pech"" bei der Randomisierung, dessen Wahrscheinlichkeit bei einem statistischen Test angegeben werden kann). 
Es werden Subgruppen aus der Untersuchungseinheit heraus gelöst, bei denen das Medikament gewirkt hat. Damit werden Hypothesen erst nach der Datenerfassung gebildet.

&gt; Die Aussteiger aus der Studie werden in der späteren Analyse ignoriert.

Damit kommt keiner mehr durch. Sowohl die Publikationsrichtlinien der wichtigen medizinischen Publikationsorgane als auch die Richtlinien für statistische Praxis bei klinischen Studien stehen dem entgegen.

&gt; Eine weitere Möglichkeit ist es, eine Studie früher als geplant abzubrechen, weil die bis dahin gewonnenen Daten positiv sind. Eine systematische Übersichtsarbeit von der McMaster Universität in Kanada kam 2005 zu dem Ergebnis, dass sich die Anzahl der abgebrochenen Studien seit 1994 verdoppelt hatte.

Dagegen ist nichts zu sagen, wenn der Abbruch von Beginn der Studie an eingeplant wurde für den Fall, dass der Effekt sich als stärker offenbart als ursprünglich eingeschätzt. Das Jahr 1994 markiert das Datum der wichtigen Publikation von Bauer und Köhne zu solchen ""adaptiven Designs"", die solche Abbrüche vorsehen können, ohne dass die Aussagen zu Irrtumswahrscheinlichkeiten ungültig werden.

&gt; Es wird nicht beides, relativer und absoluter Nutzen einer Arznei angegeben. Das geschieht vor allem deswegen, weil Studien gezeigt haben, dass ein relativer Nutzen gerne überschätzt wird.

Im Gegenteil ist es so, dass die Annahme des relativen Nutzens zur Überschätzung eines Effekts führt. Mal ein hypothetisches Beispiel: Nehmen wir an, die Beschneidung reduziere die Inzidenz von Peniskrebs auf die Hälfte. Wer wolle sich einem medizinisch so sinnvollen Eingriff verweigern. Weil aber der Peniskrebs eine ausgesprochen seltene Erkrankung ist, verhindert man bei Zehntausenden von prophylaktischen Eingriffen einen einzigen Fall. Demgegenüber muss dann die Komplikationsrate aufgerechnet werden.

Zu den Ausführungen weiter unten ist zu sagen, dass die Spezialisierung auf verschiedene Funktionen eben auch zum Beispiel dazu führt, dass die Daten nicht mehr durch einen PJ-ler zwischen zwölf Uhr und Mitternacht aus einem Zettel in eine Excel-Tabelle eingegeben werden, weil sein Chef so ein begeisterter Wissenschaftler ist, mit den vorhersehbaren Folgen für die Datenqualität.

Cooking itself is a talking point: How did you do that, When I try it that way it never works, Can you chop the onions, I got this nice knife for my birthday etc.

When you eat you at least talk fiften minutes about what you eat: Do you remember that little restaurant on our holiday, My grandma used to serve potatos with that, That farmer around the corner has the best salad, We have to make this ourselves next week etc.

After dinner, you drink a digestif, sit on the couch, a cheese plate is there and you talk about how your parents are doing, where you want to go on holiday, what is going on in your lives etc.

&gt; Eigentlich müsste bei einem Vorher-Nachher-Vergleich die Testsubstanz doch besser abschneiden, wenn die Studienteilnehmer kränker sind als die späteren Anwender? Denkfehler meinerseits?

Das kann so, aber auch andersrum sein. Hat mit Denkfehler nichts zu tun, hängt von der Krankheit ab. Wesentlich ist, dass durch ein Kollektiv mit Begleiterkrankungen die Heterogenität größer wird, also das Signal-Rausch-Verhältnis sinkt.  

Wer ein Experiment aufsetzt, möchte die Nebenbedingungen so konstant wie möglich halten, das ist gute Praxis in der Wissenschaft. Dem steht aber hier das Prinzip entgegen, dass man über den Einsatz unter realen Bedingungen etwas lernen will. Im Prinzip ist die Reproduzierbarkeit zu Beginn der Forschung und Entwicklung am wichtigsten, die Verallgemeinerbarkeit wird dann aber immer wichtiger. Die Abfolge ist vergröbert wie folgt:

 * monoklonale Zelllinien (wenig aussagekräftig über Auswirkung beim Menschen)
 * Tierversuche (schon ein wenig mehr Aussagekraft)
 * Phase I (das erste Mal am Menschen zur Verträglichkeitsprüfung, junge gesunde Probanden, immerhin schon mal die richtige Spezies)
 * Phase II (das erste Mal an der interessierenden Krankheit, meist ohne Kontrollgruppe, enge Einschlusskriterien)
 * Phase III (randomisiert gegen Kontrolle, an mehreren Krankenhäusern etc. gleichzeitig, weitere Einschlusskriterien)
 * Zulassung (oder wie man hier sagen würde: PROFIT!!!!)
 * Phase IV (keine experimentalen Bedingungen, sondern Sammeln der Daten über tatsächlichen praktischen Einsatz)

Je weiter fortgeschritten, desto teurer, aber desto weniger Moleküle werden auch getestet, die meisten fallen schon vor oder bei Phase I durchs Raster.

true,MadManWithTinFoil,BAVA,Bavaria,"You are somewhat right, I think (personally) that a break up of the Euro would lead to a German default. 
The European economies are heavily connected to each other, a lot of German money is invested outside of Germany (in fact, captial flowed out of the country since the creation of the Euro, Germany was the second biggest capital exporter behind China). 
A break up would destroy a lot of money, and I don't think many German banks and corporations could survive that.

I also assume that Germany wouldn't be the only country how need to default in that scenario, since not only Germany has invested a lot of money in other European countries. 
I see a good chance of a mass default in Europe, and only Jebus knows what the consequences would mean for the global economy and the capital markets world wide.  

And yet I have to disagree with you when you write that Germany should be doing more to keep the Euro alive. 
It is not up to us to fix the problem, the GIIPS countries need to do their reforms to sustain the Eurozone. We will buy them time for it but that's it. 

Greece will get another Haircut, because their debt level is not sustainable and everyone knew that (a lot of Germans made even fun of Samaras when he gave out a guarantee that Greece will pay back all of its credits). This time the taxpayers across Europe will pay for the haircut, and while most people wont like it, there is no way to avoid it. 
 
And Spain will be allowed to use the ESM to finance their ""bad banks"". 
That is already a lot of aid, and I haven't even mentioned Portugal and the other EZ countries in trouble.

And there isn't support for even more aid. Especially seeing the lack of responsibility, the blame ""everyonebutourself"" game and the pure hatred towards Germany. 

And since you mentioned that the Euro is still overvalued for Southern Europe, UBS had a study with nice graphs. You can see [the income growth in the Eurozone](http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5030e87d6bb3f7c83b000002/image.png). 
And maybe that has something to do with the Euro being to expansive for the Club Med?

You can also see why the German politicians will have trouble to explain a further decrease of our living standard to the voters.
We had to do a internal devaluation to stay competitive and after a decade we should do it again so we can subside other Countries?

It was a joke. Seriously, stop being serious :)

&gt; I was thinking more about France and the UK, but I just googled sharia law in Germany and it seems you already have some of those good courts functioning.

It is decreasing. In matters such polygamous marriages entered before immigration the german law is inadequate. So some islamic law was used for that. But otherwise no muslim born in Germany expects islamic law to be used in German courts today. Once the older generations of immigrants is gone, the need for resolving polygamous marriage disputes disappears automatically.

&gt;  The ones who immigrate are usually the smartest and tend to have a good work ethic.

If you accept that, then please be respectful of black immigrants who come to Germany. Some of our best students and researchers come out of that community.

If the defending the Euro means cheating and breaking every single rule, is it worth defending? It's not only jackals out there, there are a lot of sensible people and countries who is questioning this.

Why do you think a currency is worth defending that forces the poorest countries (Estonia, Slovenia) to pay for the cheating corrupt countries (Greece, Spain, Portugal). 

Why do you think it is OK to break every single rule that the Euro has? Do you know those rules? Where is the democracy in that?

Do you even care one bit about democracy? You talk about defending the Euro like it was the last line of defence against fascism, but you do not seem to care one single bit about democracy.

If the Euro was democratic, and people (like you) and countries cared about democracy, you would start *following the rules*. You know, those rules *that the Euro countries are ignoring*. Each country is responsible for their own debt, the ECB should not help individual countries, the debt should be 60 % of the GDP etc.

Those *are* the rules. The rules the people voted for. Yet, the Euro countries are ignoring those, and changing them, blatantly ignoring democracy. One can't do that, the countries said yes, *under those circumstances*. 

If you, as you claim, truly care about democracy, you would see how undemocratic this is. To save a corrupt country like Greece, you change the rules for everyone (and yes, I know other countries have broken them too, and I'll be happy to see them fined).  Fuck Estonia, fuck Finland, fuck countries that are following the rules. We will break them to save corrupt Greece, and in the meantime, pay off their debt too. 

How on earth can you not only defend, but encourage that behaviour. It is as undemocratic as it get. You are prepared and willing to sacrifice the democracy of the EU, rather than let a country take responsiblity for it behaviour.

&gt;If you fall, people will catch you  

Except the state you've been paying taxes to will not catch you, only your network, which you will not have established for some time as he or she points out. So just make sure you don't fall for your first 5-10 years and you'll be fine, ridiculous. Austrian social democracy is one big fat lie. You can expect to be screwed by everyone from real estate agents mobile phone companies, your company or university and the government on multiple levels. Austria has recently plummeted down the corruptions perception index to well below the USA and just above Spain, where it deserves to be as it is little better than Spain. The political class is almost universally corrupt and is the core vortex for the rest of society which is a series of client groups to that political class getting various protectionist and exclusive favours. Some dot points.   

* Corrupt real estate market, if you are not connected pay 2-3 times rent in commission  
* Mickey mouse legal system only available to the very rich  
* Endless red tape  
* Takes an unreasonable amount of time to set up a business, private sector is second class to the public sector in every way, businesses also heavily ""grouped"" into little protectionist mafias  
* Healthcare is attached to employment, you will be denied it rudely despite paying taxes if you quit your job to set up a business (which you can't set up quickly because you need to sign on to this or that protectionist group which will now handle your healthcare).  
* Extremely rude bureaucratic ""made men"", I use that term because it's like the mafia, they will think nothing of interrupting a conversation to take a private phone call for 10 minutes and then after it's done they will say ""I'm sorry you need to see so and so around the corner"" (something they couldn't quickly say before taking the private call right in your face). Extremely arrogant power play type behaviour.  
* The universities have been entirely taken over by these people, you often can't even see them because while at the low levels they will have almost non-existent office hours at the upper levels they hide behind keypad locked corridors and never answer the buttons even during hours (that's if they are there and not jet-setting off to a conference of academic bureaucrats to discuss how to cut money from the conference funds for the actual real academics).  
* As I understand it there are no real competitive entrance exams to the universities. Plagiarism is endemic and high level politicians can get away with it with impunity (whereas in Germany they at least have the decency to resign, for a while, or stop using the title because the university actually has the integrity to withdraw it). Here you get whitewash from rigged inquiries that everyone knows are rigged but nobody cares.     
* Bureaucrats don't just invent endless forms to justify their existence they also harass shop owners I know in very nasty ways, and in one case I've had a (native) shop owner tell me they had to pay a bribe.  
* *Everything* runs on deep connections, and people talk about it like it's nothing to be ashamed of, but it is.

I fully believe the corruption ranking: it's more corrupt than Washington and only slightly better than the basket case that is Spain. The natives will get restless at my critique here, but they are the fish that don't see the polluted water they are swimming in, it is a disgrace. Sure I have my networks now, the last job I got wasn't even advertised, the last apartment I got wasn't either and I didn't have to pay the real estate mafia. But I don't feel good about that, even though I benefit it doesn't make it any less of a disgrace. Being denied healthcare over some stupid paperwork after paying taxes for a long time was one of the last straws I can take, if I get much more trouble with my business - as I unfortunately expect - I think I am going to leave. It's one thing having all the paperwork but the pure arrogance and rudeness of the bureaucrats is just breathtaking. So yes great for a holiday or study, but expect some serious pain if you want to live here longer. About ten years of pain, at which point you might be comfortable and can enjoy all benefits with most of the downsides behind you, but at that very point you will also have to live with the shame of being complicit in the system.

No, a lot of the debt have been transferred to other countries tax payers. 

Also, you might not know economics, but if people do not *want* to lend you money because you, as a country, are so irresponsible that you can not pay them back, it is not being loaned. The Greek people were loaned money to a much, much lower rent than they otherwise would have gotten. The difference was made up by the tax payers. That difference is a pure financial gift. Other countries tax payers are subsidising Greece's loans, there is no way around that. The cost goes to other countries. Otherwise, the interest would be sky high, as in 30 % or something ridiculous like that, because the simple fact is that no one wants to lend Greece the money.

&gt;So population pressure rises again and triggers another war? It's never that easy. If the Greeks didn't get the loans, it would mostly be social services like healthcare that went on the chopping block, anyway.

No, that is *Greece's* choice. They *could* for example start taxing their shipping, which is tax free, or just become more effective (like start using computers and records, so it will be less easy to bribe etc) and become more productive. If they choose to cut down on schools etc, it is their choice.

&gt;Because the benefits Estonia or Finland are getting from the Euro far, far outweigh the disadvantages.

Please, provide me with sources for that statement. I know for example that a huge debate in Finland is that it is *not* benefitting them, at all. If Finland compare themselves to Sweden for example who is similar to Finland, Finland's economy is worse off, and some of it can be attributed to the Euro. For example, they actually had to increase their national debt, take up new loans (at the same time when they were subsidising Greece) which was hugely unpopular. Sweden has been paying off it's debt since the 90's (apart from 2009 I belive).  They also have no control over their currency, while our national bank is happily trying to adjust our interest to the *Swedish* needs, not Germany or France's. So, provide sources, I claim that you are wrong.

&gt;Their budget is under scrutiny 24/7. I think they're making the progress that is possible.

So, why haven't they even fulfilled the terms from the *first* bailout then? If they cared, they would have.


&gt;It was you who brought up Africa.

Yes, I know, but it still doesn't answer my question. You claimed, that I had White Guilt. I am still wondering why I, as a Swede should have White Guilt about.

&gt;Would you be happier if the Greeks went bankrupt and became fascist again? If you like them to suffer a bit before you consider them eligible for aid, go to Greece and see for yourself what the budget cuts so far are doing.

So, that is the only alternative. Threats? Fascism? Why can't the Greeks behave like Argentina? Or, there are poorer countries in the EU and the Euro, and they haven't subjected at all to fascism, for example Estonia Lithuania, and Latvia, or why not Slovakia etc. If the Greeks become fascist, it is because they *choose* to, nothing else. Do you think the EU should succumb to blackmail from the Greeks - if you do not help us, we will become fascist. I think not,that would be impossible.

&gt;Preventing that will prevent much more harm than giving HIV blockers to someone in Rwanda, so he can die from another cause.

You really do no know anything about Africa do you? That is so ignorant and your view of people dying of AIDS is disgusting. If you truly mean that, you are a horrible, horrible person. I hope you do not.

&gt; you like them to suffer a bit before you consider them eligible for aid, go to Greece and see for yourself what the budget cuts so far are doing.

Are you truly, honestly, comparing sub Saharan Africa with Greece? Are you claiming that the Greeks are suffering as much as those countries? Are on the same level. If you are, you must be one of the most ignorant people on the Internet, and that is saying a lot.

If we can't deal with that content ourselves and if we get offended by it then reddit clearly isn't the place for us.

Yeah, well, it's been done before here on r/europe itself, people have been banned for making such comments and for less as well.

true,AgathaCrispy,null,null,"I studied in DE for two months, but I only spent three days in Berlin. I'll give you my impressions of my time there. Short version: It's awesome! Great history, night life, and plenty to see and do. There's alot of tourism, so they are used to seeing us American's wondering around bewildered. The people were very friendly and helpful, so don't be afraid to ask for directions, and they even tolerated me butchering their language very well. If your German isn't very good, you shouldn't worry about it. They appreciated the effort, but the majority of people I talked to spoke better English than I did German.

I'm going to assume that you have to have health insurance for the time that you are there in order to be accepted (thats how my school did it) and that students get a transportation pass through the Uni, so you've got that covered.  You'll want to get a pay as you go phone most likely, but a basic one is cheap, the cell coverage in Europe is crazy good, and you can get phone cards just about everywhere. 

I'm sure that your host family will meet you and want to show you around, so that will help you to get the lay of the land. The Uni will also have student liaisons that will probably give you a tour and then take you out for a beer later. 

I tend to mostly wander around when I'm in a new city, and try to see more than just the tourist areas. I like to pick random streets and follow them or hop on whichever bus comes next and see where it goes, and that's what I did in Berlin for the most part. I found the transportation system very easy to navigate, and there are city maps at many of the stops, so if you get lost, just check your location there. I wouldn't worry about getting around or getting lost. It is a large city and spread out, but honestly there are so many landmarks that it is difficult to get really lost, even in the suburbs. [The Fernsehturm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehturm_Berlin) is a good one to look for, as you can see it from many parts of the city. Berlin is a big destination for tourists, so there are alot of English translations on signs and such.  I carried around one of the free tourist maps you find at the information booths just because they show exactly where landmarks are, and you can use them to get your bearings. I'm sure that, as with every city, there are 'bad' parts that you might want to avoid, but I didn't find them. The locals will be able to tell you more about that than I can.

Things you might not think of? 

Check with your bank to see if there are any crazy fees associated with using your debit/credit cards in Europe. Mine had transaction fees, so it made more sense to just take out cash every once in a while rather than using the card. At the very least let them know that you will be traveling there (give them dates and locations) so that they don't put a hold on your card when a charge from Germany shows up on it. 

Bring a good waterproof jacket and shoes and pack a dufflebag (or buy a cheap one when you're there) since you will pick up alot of stuff over the next four months and it won't all fit in your luggage. That's all I can think of at the moment.

If you have an Android phone, get Offi Transportation Buddy. Hands down amazing public transport app. Google did not have transit info for my town. (Konstanz). You can mark your host family's flat as ""Home"" and there is a great ""Take me home NOW"" route planner.

One big thing about Google Maps.. After coming from the US and plotting a walking route, stuff looks FAR away, but is 600m and a 3 minute walk. Make sure you keep perspective!

I moved on very short notice and do not speak Deutsche yet, but I am slowly trying to learn. Duolingo.com is an amazing free language site.

For me, it has been a big shock to see so many people out riding bicycles in the snow and ice. It may just be where I am living, but i see people peddling uphill with their kid(s) in a bike trailer and they are spinning their wheel 2:1.

I have also pretty much given up Coke or any kind of soda, but tripled my coffee intake.

Enjoy Germany. It is beautiful here!


EDIT - A couple other quick things:

Make sure your mobile is unlocked before you try to buy a prepaid SIM and shove it in.  If you have T-Mobile or AT&amp;T (99% GSM), you can call 611, tell them you are travelling to Europe, and want to use a SIM while you are here.  If your account is in good standing, they will most likely give you the unlock code for your phone.  If you are on Verizon or Sprint (99% CDMA), sorry but your phone will most likely not work over here.  You can ""rent"" a global phone from them, but you might be better off picking up an older GSM smartphone from Craigslist or something.

If you are not using Google Voice, get a Google Voice number or start using Gmail/GTalk to call home.  Install either GrooveIP or Talkatone on your mobile phone to call home for free via Wifi.

On Android, you can also cache areas of Google Maps offline so you are not using data just looking.  Hold down to mark a location, and select ""Save offline""

Corrected the name from Offi to Öffi. It is hard to find in the app store without the umlaut!

Lastly, be careful what appliances/devices you plan on bringing over.  Europe is 240V, so keep an eye on your electronics.  Almost everything you would travel with can usually handle 240V, but check the Input Voltage on the transformer.  If you are planning on bringing anything like an XBox or PS3, know that only new TVs with HDMI are easily usable, they have something called SCART connectors over here which is not like the old yellow/red/white connectors.",0,1356640292,null,0,1356641604,0,c7mxnnc,t3_15j110,t1_c7mxnnc,t3_15j110,null,1430784686,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;It's an intellectually dishonest view that we can simply leave at any time, or that we have no ties keeping us in.

You do can leave though. If you choose to remain in then don't act like we're forcing you into this union or that we're keeping you down.

&gt;Funny how 'showing commitment' means 'going 100% with the group, with no dissent' to you.

It doesn't mean that, it means to work with the group and it means not trying to undermine the project you're a part of.

&gt;No other countries gets this flak.

No other countries constantly threat to leave the union. No other countries constantly claim that EU is illegitimate. No other country alienates itself so much from the rest.

&gt;We are far from the only country that complains or tries to bend things towards their own benefit. Hell, look at France and their CAP. 

True that. Unfortunately.

&gt;You don't see a single fucking comment in this subreddit saying how (to continue this example) France 'needs to commit' or 'need to decide if they're in or out' whenever they push for their own thing. 

Because they don't constantly threaten to leave the union. Just because they're steering it in the wrong direction (and they are, to continue your example, CAP needs to go or be radically reformed) that doesn't mean they're acting against the EU, they're simply trying to get the most out of it (which is reasonable enough, though yet again, you're absolutely right that protectionism and government subsidies be it on farming or on whatever are inefficient, unsustainable and harmful for the union).

While France doesn't need to be more committed to the EU, they do need to change its policies. The UK, IMO, needs to do the exact opposite, keep its policies but work to see them implemented EU-wide, to actually show some commitment instead of opting out on everything and badmouthing the EU whenever they get a chance.

&gt;But the moment Britain does anything, hold the phone! Stop the presses! The Brits are out of control and are going to have a rude awakening!

&gt;We didn't join out of a sense of European unity or identity, only to ensure our economy could be maintained. In exchange for this privilege we had to surrender part of our sovereignty and pay a fee.
 
We Portuguese joined you on EFTA. Though we left it and joined the nowadays EU out of a sense that more could be achieved if we worked together on a wider array of issues.

You British did the same. If you're having second thoughts and regrets, fine, but you can't claim ignorance, you can't say the free-trade union was hijacked and that the rest of Europe is pushing you down a path of ever increasing integration against your will, so far your representatives have always agreed on the British membership of the EU, never during the process were the British forced in.

&gt;So it is no surprise the public holds no love for Europe, we joined the union under economic threat. If I am wrong please explain.

If the benefits outweigh the costs then remain in the EU, if not then you're free to leave the Union.

The UK (and everybody else) wants what's best for its own people, and since you're in you do can try to steer the EU so that it works more to your benefit, however you can't say you're under economic threat or that the EU ought to only give you the benefits of being in the single market and exempt you from the costs of participating in such an agreement.

Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, Ukraine, Turkey and Morocco are all examples of countries close to the EU that yet aren't a part of the Union. They never joined and they're not under economic threat. They lose out on (some of) the benefits on the single market but they also don't have to pay for (some of) the costs associated with it.

true,2early2bcreative,null,null,"i rode from Cologne along the rhine up to Karlsruhe, then crossed the Black Forest (in September IIRC, so not High Season). i´ll try to answer some

1. since the route is flat (or downhill if you start in andermatt), campgear extra weight isn´t much of a deal, but gives you more flexibility. i think it´s officially forbidden, but if you find a nice spot out of sight you can camp for free. taking your rubbish with you is understood. hostels, campsites and cheap B&amp;B are plentiful along the way, anyway.  

2. can´t tell, but easily believable. make a detour through the countryside if you have time. 

3. fuckheads are everywhere, so better be safe than sorry. decent locks should do, though. when going sightseeing finding a place to store your stuff wouldn´t be bad (railway station?)

4. most of what i´ve ridden on was good. sometimes i switched to the road.

5. if that´s around 100euro it should be good (for germany). switzerland is a bit steep in prices.

6. since it´s flat you can do 100km a day easily. if you want to do sightseeing (and there´s a lot to do), the trip can take you a month.

7. dictionary, GPS unit is nice to have, maps otherwise. 
8. upper rhine valley (via mala) is stunning, walk around there. all the old cities (konstanz, basel, strassburg, bonn, cologne,etc...), castles in the middle rhine valley,...

Chillax, go out, have a good time and don't act like such an horny mofo.

As for your edit, I just read it now.

&gt;Women don't drink here. 

Italy isn't Saudi Arabia, women do drink. You have to know the proper clubs and you might have to buy them a drink or two, but they do drink.

&gt;And if they do go to places where drinks are served, they don't go alone (never!) or with only female friends.

If they did, it would be too easy. Don't you also have friends? Go out with them, you'll have a good time and you'll have plenty of chances of being with girls.

&gt;So, believe me, what you suggest has no possibility of ever happening.

Not if you act all socially awkward and give up before even trying.

Has it ever occurred to you that there are other reasons for moving here than work? Or that the unemployment rate doesn't affect educated foreign nationals as much as it does Spaniards?

There are *plenty* of IT jobs availabile for the taking, especially for native English speakers. 

I was in the same situation as lucky7strike last December. Dual US-EU citizen, moved to Spain as a recent college graduate, 3-4 years of IT experience. I had a job offer the second day for a startup (turned it down because of low salary), ended up getting 5 more interviews and three offers in total from 80 CVs that I sent out over two months. 

Here was the routine I followed:

Every couple days, I crawled the following sites for new job listings:

* http://barcelona.craigslist.es/jjj/ 
* http://www.loquo.com/es_es
* http://www.indeed.es/
* http://www.infojobs.net 
* www.trabajos.com
* http://www.wiseri.com
* LinkedIn - various Spain groups
* http://www.tecnoempleo.com
* http://www.oficinaempleo.com/ 
* http://www.monster.es

Honestly, the only really good site of those above is InfoJobs, actually it's far better than any site we have in the US because you can see if the employer has actually looked at your resume and you can see how many people have applied to each job.

Apart from cold calling, I also used my personal networks:

* I searched for anyone on LinkedIn who had connections that lived in Spain and asked to be introduced. Got my first job offer this way.
* I went to language intercambios and if I met someone who was in IT I networked with them, got their e-mail address, shot them my resume, etc. Also was great for improving my Spanish at the same time.
* I sent my CV to absolutely everyone I knew in Spain, no matter what field they were in, and asked them to keep their eyes out if they saw anything that fit my needs.

So there you have it. After two and a half months I was happily employed. The biggest lesson I learned: **If you want it bad enough, and you are qualified, you will get it.** Don't sit around bitching about the crisis and how there's no work. Go out and create your own opportunities.

You can stay on the pulpit and preach the fury of hell against cheaters, or you can actually come down and do something about the mess.

&gt;Why do you think a currency is worth defending that forces the poorest countries (Estonia, Slovenia) to pay for the cheating corrupt countries (Greece, Spain, Portugal).

Spain had a lower government debt than Germany. Portugal is one of the poorer countries themselves. Greece is a fraud, but it's too late to complain about that now. Estonia and Slovenia have benefited more the Euro than it has cost them so far, and then we're not even talking about the long term.

&gt; You know, those rules that the Euro countries are ignoring. Each country is responsible for their own debt, the ECB should not help individual countries, the debt should be 60 % of the GDP etc.

Those rules were untenable as soon as a real crisis happened.

&gt;I know other countries have broken them too, and I'll be happy to see them fined

Hey, where were you when the stalwart champion of financial austerity, Germany, broke the rules and set a bad precedent? Why not make an example of the first one to break the rules? Oh no, can't pick on the big ones. Let's find someone smaller to pick on...

&gt;We will break them to save corrupt Greece, and in the meantime, pay off their debt too.

Estonia has paid 148 million, which is not a back-breaking sum.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;No, a lot of the debt have been transferred to other countries tax payers.

That's how you rebalance an overloaded debt burden. Being in a union means that you stick by in the bad times, my fair weather friend.

&gt;Also, you might not know economics, but if people do not want to lend you money because you, as a country, are so irresponsible that you can not pay them back, it is not being loaned.

So far the theory: in practice, everybody looked to each other and the rating agencies, and the latter made up stuff to make everybody feel good about loaning more. Everybody (private, public, individuals, institutions, everyone) was drunk on the debt party. Greece is a convenient scapegoat, but they're just an aperitif to sanitizing the financial system.

&gt;No, that is Greece's choice. They could for example start taxing their shipping, which is tax free, or just become more effective (like start using computers and records, so it will be less easy to bribe etc) and become more productive. If they choose to cut down on schools etc, it is their choice.

Why, yes, it's solely a matter of good will and effort. If they *really* wanted to they could wave their magic wand and put a fresh computer on every desktop, and people would stop asking for extra fees because they're suddenly 100% sure their doctor won't ask for a bribe next time they need him. Do things have to change? Yes. Will they do spectacularly overnight? No.

&gt;So, provide sources, I claim that you are wrong.

I'm going to do exactly the same.

&gt;So, why haven't they even fulfilled the terms from the first bailout then? If they cared, they would have.

This isn't kindergarten you know. Sometimes things are hard to change, and the cookies simply aren't in the jar, it's not because the nanny doesn't care for you that you don't get one. So crying that it's not fair won't change her mind.
And even if it did, what's the point? You need to vouch for Greece, fishy budgets or not. Because if you don't, they're going after Spain next (even though Spain had a very low debt to GDP rate), and then the whole thing falls apart. Fairness is not relevant here. Relevant is what you can enforce.

&gt;Yes, I know, but it still doesn't answer my question. You claimed, that I had White Guilt. I am still wondering why I, as a Swede should have White Guilt about.

I didn't mention white guilt, if you read it into something I said, cite me.

&gt;So, that is the only alternative. Threats?

You again assume that things happen because people want them to happen. Grow up and face reality: Greece is close to the Balkan with a recent history of war, there was a dictatorship in the '70s, and fascist groups are already gaining support. There's a real chance that such a thing happens, yes. Not because of bad faith, it's just the way things are.

&gt;Or, there are poorer countries in the EU and the Euro, and they haven't subjected at all to fascism, for example Estonia Lithuania, and Latvia, or why not Slovakia etc.

Hold your horses, they've been independent for a mere two decades in a period of enduring prosperity. If things become sufficiently bad, some people will say ""it was better with communism"" or ""it's the fault of the immigrants!"" (doesn't matter if it's true), and there you go. Then again, it might not.

&gt; If the Greeks become fascist, it is because they choose to, nothing else.

As I said, it only takes bad luck and an aggressive minority to end up with a militaristic regime. It's always a minority that grabs power, making *all* Greeks responsible for it is just a way to soothe your own conscience.

&gt; Do you think the EU should succumb to blackmail from the Greeks - if you do not help us, we will become fascist. I think not,that would be impossible.

Yeah, Greece will become fascist just to take revenge on the EU. &lt;facepalm&gt;
Even if that was true, then the costs of military intervention and humanitarian aid would dwarf what we're spending now, so it remains the cheapest option.

&gt;You really do no know anything about Africa do you? That is so ignorant and your view of people dying of AIDS is disgusting. If you truly mean that, you are a horrible, horrible person. I hope you do not.

If you really knew something about Africa you would know that only as recently as the nineties hundreds of thousands of people were killed in genocidal slaughter. Apparently that's no problem for you, while you lambast the Greeks for blackmailing (you! personally!). I would call it hypocritical if I thought you knew what you were talking about.

&gt;Are you truly, honestly, comparing sub Saharan Africa with Greece? Are you claiming that the Greeks are suffering as much as those countries?

Be sure to download the [ÖPNV app](http://www.androidpit.de/de/android/market/apps/app/de.schildbach.oeffi/Oeffi-OePNV-Auskunft), so you can easily find the best connections for public transit on the go. The first few times you'll still have to constantly consult the app and might still get a bit confused sometimes, but that will quickly wear off.

 Don't get a car, you won't use/need it, but definitely buy a (used) bike - that and the ÖPNV will easily get you everywhere you need to go.

As long as you remember to bring all your (visa) paperwork, your passport and money there is really nothing you couldn't easily get in Berlin. 

One thing that foreigners (especially yanks &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;) often forget is how important it is to speak German, even if you're unsure about certain words or grammar. Everyone with an university education speaks good English, but it's highly appreciated if you show an effort to learn our language and culture. 

Also, be nice and bring a gift for your host family.

Viel Spass und gute Reise :)

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;That's how you rebalance an overloaded debt burden. Being in a union means that you stick by in the bad times, my fair weather friend.

You claimed that *Greece's* tax payers paid for it, that it was just a loan. No cost to other countries tax payers, since they *loaned* the money. Now you are saying yourself, that Greece have received money (not loans) from other countries. Then Greece have costed all the other countries tax payers money. That is something you claimed that they hadn't before. So, what is it then? Loans, that Greece take to *the full price of the market, that doesn't cost other countries tax payers a single dime*, or, is Greece actually being sponsored by other countries. 

&gt;I'm going to do exactly the same.

Are you a teenageer? You do know one doesn't have to prove a negative? As in, prove there is no God? You claimed, that the Finns were better off, because of the Euro, but you are not willing to back that up with facts?  I have, unlike you I suspect, followed the Finnish debate, and the problem for the pro Euro government is that they have no facts to back it up with. Parts of the Finnish opposition (the True Finns/Sannfinländarna who is a populistic party rather against the Euro and the bailouts)want out, and have repeatedly ask them to prove the claim that the Euro is better. I have no great love for the True Finns, but they are right there - the government can't. So, since you seem to be sitting on information not even the Finns have, please, give it to them. The Finnish government will love you. 

But fine,  be a child then. [Here](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/sweden/indicators) is Sweden's financial information. In the GDP growth for example, I choose 2001- 2011 - [here](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/sweden/gdp-growth).
[Here](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/finland/indicators) is the same information for Finland [here](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/finland/gdp-growth). Could you please point to me how Finland is better off with the Euro? Prove it, because to me it doesn't look that way. Now I guess that you are going to say something like ""two different countries etc,can't compare"", but remember, *you* claimed it, then you should be able to prove it. 

&gt;So far the theory: in practice, everybody looked to each other and the rating agencies, and the latter made up stuff to make everybody feel good about loaning more. Everybody (private, public, individuals, institutions, everyone) was drunk on the debt party. Greece is a convenient scapegoat, but they're just an aperitif to sanitizing the financial system.

I don't like our fincial system either, but it is not a reason or an excuse to cheat for Greece, or to make other countries pay for them. Belgium for example has fucked up too, but at least they don't ask other countries tax payers to pay for them. We aare all part of the same system, yet Greeks are the ones who need to be bailed out all the time. What makes them so special? 

&gt;Why, yes, it's solely a matter of good will and effort. If they really wanted to they could wave their magic wand and put a fresh computer on every desktop, and people would stop asking for extra fees because they're suddenly 100% sure their doctor won't ask for a bribe next time they need him. Do things have to change? Yes. Will they do spectacularly overnight? No.

Oh, the poor poor Greeks again. Their is absolutely no possibility, in the last four five years that they could start taxing their shipping for example. Of course the Greeks can't start to use computerized records, or actually fire the people they said they were going to fire in the *first* bailout. Poor, poor Greeks. We will just have to wait and pay them, until the Greeks decide they can do those things. *Or* they could man up and start to change and doing the things they promised to do in the first place. But they are not.

&gt;Hold your horses, they've been independent for a mere two decades in a period of enduring prosperity. If things become sufficiently bad, some people will say ""it was better with communism"" or ""it's the fault of the immigrants!"" (doesn't matter if it's true), and there you go. Then again, it might not.

Probably not. Have you been there? They do not want to go back to communism. They also believe in having a choice, and not whining. Estonia for example, worked like hell to get into the Euro. The people of Estonia *choose* not to cheat. Those decades of prosperity you are talking about, they happened in Greece to, and they have been a free country much, much longer btw

&gt;This isn't kindergarten you know. Sometimes things are hard to change, and the cookies simply aren't in the jar, it's not because the nanny doesn't care for you that you don't get one

Is that your argument for why Greece isn't fulfilling the conditions from the *first* bailout. This is not kindergarten. What other international financial agreements do you think states should just walk away from, just because ""this isn't kindergarten""? Is that OK for you, just ignoring treaties and agreements? Should every single country be able to do that, ignore treaties and agreements, or is that a special provision you make for Greece? If so, why is Greece so special? If not - do you see what happens (Euro crises for example) when countries does not follow the rules. Why should Greece be allowed to continue down that road? 

&gt;You again assume that things happen because people want them to happen. Grow up and face reality: Greece is close to the Balkan with a recent history of war, there was a dictatorship in the '70s, and fascist groups are already gaining support. There's a real chance that such a thing happens, yes. Not because of bad faith, it's just the way things are.

That is still no reason tu succumb to threats, and yes, I do assume those things happen because they want to. Do you mean for example that the rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is because people *do not* want them. Of course they do, even though they are not very democratic, the people of Egypt are voting for them. Their choice. If the Greeks choose to go down that path, it will be their own doing, and their own path. Do not even dare to blame that on Europe, Finland, Sweden or anyone else. EU will deal with it then, but the EU can not pay for Greece for or eternity, since *otherwise we will become fascist.*. That is blackmail

&gt;Yeah, Greece will become fascist just to take revenge on the EU. &lt;facepalm&gt; Even if that was true, then the costs of military intervention and humanitarian aid would dwarf what we're spending now, so it remains the cheapest option.

Again, that is a) if they *choose* to become a dictatorship b) then they will have to leave the EU btw, and c) is the EU willing to intervene after that? Again, that is only if the Greeks chooses to fuck up even more. They do have a choice you know, frankly, more choice than most people in the world, if you look at the statistics of finances, education, women equality etc. So yes, they have every chance of not becoming fascists.

&gt;If you really knew something about Africa you would know that only as recently as the nineties hundreds of thousands of people were killed in genocidal slaughter. Apparently that's no problem for you, while you lambast the Greeks for blackmailing (you! personally!). I would call it hypocritical if I thought you knew what you were talking about.

Yes, I do know that. Unlike you I suspect, I have been in Ruwanda. To say however, that there is no use helping them, because they will die of something else anyway, is a horrible attitude. And the genocide, frankly, that to me is even more reason to help them, make sure it doesn't happen again. I suspect you care more about Greece though, than dying children of Africa.

&gt;You brought up Africa. And apparently you would rather risk letting Greece devolve a good part of the way towards African averages just to satisfy your bloodlust, rather than facing the facts and doing what is necessary.

Yes, I did bring up Africa. I said, with *my* money, I'd rather help the people of Africa, than of Greece. You however, keep claiming that the EU, IMF etc have nothing more important to do than to help out the Greeks. And, you do know, tax payers money is always someone's money. I propose a vote among the tax payers of Europe. Do you want to keep paying for the Greeks with your money, or not? Who do you think will win?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You can stay on the pulpit and preach the fury of hell against cheaters, or you can actually come down and do something about the mess.

That is not an argument against not following rules, treaties and regulations. 

Are you saying that one shouldn't? And then, please provide a good answer why one shouldn't follow rules regulations etc.


Also, I'd like to know that since you do not seem to care about treaties etc, does that go for every singel treaty in the world, or just financial ones, or just the ones in the EU. Which treaties, laws etc do you think is right to follow, and which isn't? Geneva convention? Rio convention? Lisbon treaty? Do you want anarchy, since you seem to think it is OK to ignore them. 

If requesting that countries follow the treaties that they promised to follow (and have the ability too) is ""preaching the fury of hell"" or being on a high horse, well then I guess I do that. I think people and countries  should do what they promise. I try to do that, and I try to vote for people like that too. Mostly, my country does follow the rules, and I do too. I set standards, that I expect me, and my country to follow. Do you think that is wrong? Why? 

Germany could have followed the rules,  Greece could have. They both *choose* not to. Apparently they do not care.

&gt; Estonia and Slovenia have benefited more the Euro than it has cost them so far, and then we're not even talking about the long term.

Proof please. Is Estonia far better off than Latvia, Lithuania due to the Euro? Doubt it. 

&gt;Those rules were untenable as soon as a real crisis happened.

No, they were not, and one of the reasons a real crises happend, is that countries and people kept ignoring them (which you seem to think is OK, agreements are not important to you). If the countries had stuck to them, it wouldn't have been so bad. Also, perhaps it would have been better for Greece as well. Yes, they would have been thrown out (or never let in in the first place)of the Euro, but they would have had real chances of growth, planning their own finances etc. Now they seem to be angry at everyone but themselves.

Besides, you are dodging the question. Is this democratic? How can you defend the non-democratic behaviour? The people of the EU has voted about *these* rules. They said yes to the Euro under certain circumstances. If they are changing the rules, one need to ask again. One can't just keep breaking them, ignoring them, for eternity? That is appallingly un-democratic, and I can't even begin to understand why you encourage and defend no democratic behaviour.

Is that what you think? That the EU should become more and more non democratic, ignoring rules and treaties and what the people voted for? Because, that is what you are defending. Remember - each country is responsible for their own debt.......

What other areas do you think the EU should be non democratic in? Do you prefer dictatorship?


&gt;Hey, where were you when the stalwart champion of financial austerity, Germany, broke the rules and set a bad precedent? Why not make an example of the first one to break the rules? Oh no, can't pick on the big ones. Let's find someone smaller to pick on...

No you are just making things up. Are you blaming me for not being in an argument with you in 2003? (which is I believe, when Germany broke the rules the first time, can be wrong about that though). I voted no to the Euro in the Swedish elections of 2003, and have been arguing against it, ever since. Before my Finnish friends used tot tease me and asked if I like my silly Swedish money/thought we could survive outside the Euro etc - I joked back Then I started to make fun of them and ask if they liked being the only good pupil in the class. I continued asking if they loved taking up new loans to pay for Greece, while the Greeks were dodging taxes like there's no tomorrow. Now I have stopped, we are rarely referring to it any more. They just look sad, sigh, and I don't want to kick them while they are down. 

I have critisized the Euro since 2003, and a lot of the countries in it. I do not see how you can claim that I haven't. I'll be thrilled if Germany/France/the Netherlands/Belgium etc were fined for example. But above all, I have never belived in that so different econmies can ""join up"" without significant permanent financial transfer. Nor do I believe that different economies can join up, without something going wrong. Also, one need to have ways of stricter enforcing of the rules etc. And, I believe that Sweden is a small country and no one would look out for us. They want our money, but do not care about us. I belive our government makes a better job, than the EU in taking care of Sweden etc - as you can tell, I have millions of arguments against the Euro.


&gt;Estonia has paid 148 million, which is not a back-breaking sum.

It is a lot for them, and the fact is, it is not your, or anyone elses choice to make. They were supposed to pay nothing. And, please know that they are poorer than the Greeks. Why should they pay anything. What on earth have they done? 

&gt;So what does ""taking responsibility for its behaviour"" mean for Greece exactly, apart from a public flogging and a stern talk?

Stop voting for corrupt idiots. Admit that they have been voting for corrupt idiots for decades because it has suited them. Start doing what they have promised to do (like for example fulfill the conditions of the *first* bailout). Start using financial common sense, like start taxing their shipping industry, stop paying stupid pensions to public employees etc  (seriously the shipping is so bloody stupid and corrupt. It's like Sweden wouldn't tax our forrest or mining industry). Start paying taxes. Stop paying bribes. Start caring and working towards being more productive (I know the Greeks work, but their productivity is really low).  Start following the rules, for God's sake.",0,1356669142,null,0,false,0,c7n52b8,t3_151p9n,t1_c7n52b8,t1_c7n1js1,null,1430788252,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
