true,OneSalientOversight,AUST,Australia,"I live in Australia but this argument is still the same.

There are multiple factors which have led to the US being high in gun violence - not just the occasional mass shooting but the common one-on-one murders that occur every day and which hardly ever get reported.

One factor is the lack of a welfare net. We in other western countries choose to pay our poor and unemployed more money and give them more generous benefits overall. We also have universal health care. The US has very little of these benefits. Turning to a life of crime is seen as a legitimate career opportunity for many. Moreover, people are expected to ""look after themselves"" so much that the potential for failure is huge. This puts a great amount of psychological pressure upon people. I'm confident that an expansion in the welfare system in the US to be at European levels will result in less crime overall, and thus less gun crime overall.

But then there is also the issue of gun availability. The US has the highest level of guns per capita in the western world. They also have the highest levels of gun crime in the western world. This is one of those cases where correlation does equal causation.

Most gun crime is committed by those who have illegal weapons, but where did these illegal weapons come from? There aren't illegal gun factories operating in third world countries that are shipping their products to the US. Most of America's guns are made legally and made in America. How did these legal firearms end up in the hands of criminals and becoming illegal?

true,tugasnake,PORT,Portugal,"&gt;I disagree with that, before the state put the banking retirements on the Social security bill, the social security was viable for at least 30 more years. Now the government say it can only last for 7 more. So it's not that the program are viable in the long run (although i can agree adjustments need to be done due to the aging population), but it's the government mismanagement again of money that people paid them for their retirements, so again the government breaking the social contract.

SS is a ponzi scheme, when it was created the average life expectancy was much lower and the birth rate much higher, since then it has not adapted enough to our new reality and is unsustainable in the long run, with or without banking retirements. You can't have a working SS with growing recipients whilst the tax base is shrinking.

Besides being economically better, the free market is also morally superior since it's based on voluntary interaction and respect for human freedom and private property.

&gt;And do you wanna trust your retirement and your health to the banks and private companies? Especially in a monopolized economy like ours

With the market ***I*** have choice, I can choose how and with whom I do business, it's in my control. The same does not apply with the state which obliges me to follow their decisions. 

&gt;No, the leadership is elected to represent it's electorate, they should govern on what they promise on the campaign, which is why people voted for them. our government right now is going way beyond the troika's memorandum and doing things that they promised on campaign they never would do. They effectively lied to the people that elected them. I cannot explain why people voted constantly on the same 3parties, but the last election I'm sure no one though these guys were gonna turn into such a psychopaths.

They know that they can fool the people, in the end we're all to blame, politicians for not looking after the interest of the nation and the citizens for letting them get away with it.

&gt;but the last election I'm sure no one though these guys were gonna turn into such a psychopaths.

Their not following these policies out of a sadistic pleasure of seeing the people suffer, their following them because there's no other way out of this crisis... It would be much easier for the government to increase social spending/decrease taxes and increase their odds of getting re-elected, but they just can't afford that.

&gt;It's not working because it makes no sense. The troika says fire 100.000 public servants. The government does, and says they'll save x amount of money, and they forget that those people don't disappear because they were fired. 

You also forget that to employ those 100.000 public servants you are taking from the economy so when they're fired the government reduces it's expenditure and can afford to cut taxes eventually, and I say eventually because tax cuts will only be feasible if we balance our accounts through spending cuts.

Now instead of working in the private sector where they would likely be more productive they are employed by a state which cannot afford them and does not have the necessary motivation to put their skills to their best use.

http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html#disbanding_troops

Bastiat explains this much better than I ever could.


&gt;They will get unemployment, RSU maybe after that, and they won't pay taxes, and they will probably buy much less things and be another number for the increasing unemployment rate.

Or maybe they will find another job and keep on with their life, we can't afford so many public servants and it makes no sense to keep them employed because we fear they may not find their own way. You have to believe in their capacity and understand that there's no other way... For all intents and purposes the only thing between us and bankruptcy is the Troika and we must deal with our debt crisis now rather than later since our debt is like a snow ball that just keeps growing. We have a very short time frame to get our shit together before our debt reaches a unsustainable point where a default becomes inevitable (which may have already happened, but that's a whole other discussion)...

&gt;You can't cut all spending and cut taxes and implement austerity all at the same time because austerity causes more spending for the social security. I think everyone wants spending cuts, on the actual non essential things, like the public-private partnerships, not on social safety nets.

Not if you austerity centers around liberalizing the work market and leaving more wealth into the private sector... Either way what alternatives do we have? We are broke! Cutting spending is all that's left for us to do and although I agree that we should start with non essential things of which there are plenty, there's no doubt in my mind that social spending will also have to receive cuts. The old paradigm where the state took care of us is dying and a new is being born where individual responsibility takes more relevance.

If you were a jew in Nazi Germany, would you want guns (and all of your fellow jews to have guns)?  We have seen countless times in history how governments (who are always armed) turn violent on their people.  And if the people aren't armed, they have to put up with the tyranny.  The framers of the US constitution were being killed by the government, and their wives were being raped.  They included the right to guns in case future generations needed to rise up against an abusive government.  

Canadians are just as armed as people from the US, but they don't have the violence.  **US has a fucked up culture**, and no laws can change that.  The American people need to change who they are (though like everywhere else, most people are GOOD in the US).  

Also the media is to blame.  They cover the tragedies as if it's crucial to everyday life of every American (while ignoring things that actually are like wars, corruption, etc.)  There aren't that many fucked up people who think about mass shootings, but those who are fucked up see what instant celebrates the media is willing to make them, and then they go for it.  

Then there are the pharmaceutical companies that have their way with American society.  So many of these drugs caused people to act out violently.  

You have the strict drug laws, which lead to a great deal of gun violence that wouldn't exist if drugs were legal.  

Last but not least, the US has very little mental healthcare.  Obviously no form of healthcare is universal here, but even those with insurance often don't have mental health coverage, and even if they do it doesn't pay for enough of it. 

So in short, you can ignore the constitution (which allows for the right to own guns) and ban them if you want.  But it won't change the culture.  It won't change the lack of mental healthcare.  It won't change the media.  It won't solve all of the things that are REALLY causing this.

2010 FBI Uniform Crime Report, it's online and breaks down crime by type, race, gender and other factors.
Black men account for ~55% of homicides according to the UCR but make up only 6% of the US population according to Wikipedia.

Globally, our per capita homicide rate is 4.2 per 100K (wiki again). If you do the math and scale down the number of homicides to be in line with the percent of the population they represent, you get a per capita homicide rate of 2.2 per 100K, which is the same as Finland.

Hopefully that walks you through my analysis enough for you to be able to retrace by steps and sources.
(Aside, black men also make up the majority of victims - it's easy conjecture to attribute the bulk of those homicides to gang and drug related crime given the situation society's created for them)
6% is probably an over-estimate btw since it includes black men of all ages, when the homicides are disproportionately committed by the young. If you included age as a variable as well, our per capita homicide rate of 2.2 would be even lower. Alas, I could not find an exact number so I went with the less generous 6% figure.

Take a moment and absorb that...a minority making up less than 6% of the population of the US is responsible for over 55% of homicides. They murder at such high rates that they move the US per capita homicide rate from western european levels to tin pot dictatorship levels. Three decades of bad government policy turned a group that lead a peaceful civil rights revolution into a group that murders more than any other group on the planet.

In America every one has a gun and there's crime on an even larger scale than in Europe (not saying we don't have large scale crime). If people in America don't have guns they are genuinely vulnerable because the state is a lot less able to protect them than in the EU.

The USA doesn't interfere with individuals lives to the same extent as in European countries meaning the USA can't monitor its civilians and tourists closely enough to keep illegal guns out.

The logical conclusion is to give other people guns too. There by making the guns that criminals have less effective. There's just no solution to America's gun problem. You can't get rid of the guns and letting every one have them makes every one marginally more safe. That's why they do what they do. There are other bad reasons they do it aswel. Such as wanting to have the ability to over throw the government..... Oh and because it's their ""God given right"" or something. Those are bad reasons, but they only need one good reason which they have.

1. The American War on Drugs is a prohibition campaign, not a year long war with hour-long firefights between army units and drug cartels armed with assault rifles and machine-guns. Stop talking about what you don't understand.  
2. I thought you wanted to stick with mass shootings? Those that were stated above didn't relate in any way to the war on drugs, in case you didn't notice that. Also there's still the argument that there wasn't a single comparable incident in the largest european country this year, while the USA had at least half a dozen.

There was a case of 7 people shot in 2007, which caused widespread horror because it was basically unprecedented and remains unrepeated to this day. Even our crime syndicates don't go around with guns blazing.
4. I highly doubt the overall effect of the Mexican Drug war would be anywhere near the level it is at, if it was significantly harder to get firearms.

1. Just because the USA has cracked down on ""organized crime"" greater than Mexico does not mean the effect of gang/drug trafficking crime is any less.  So Mexico moves with large numbers (suppliers) out in the open while USA's are small and turf fighting (distributors) does not negate statistics.  Which, btw, your rational may equal more homicide figures for the USA seeing as Police shooting criminals aren't counted as homicides.

2. Sorry, I tried to follow you /shrugs  But to the point, we would have to operant define a ""mass shooting"" and have a large enough period of time.  As usual people want to discuss an issue when it fits their political cause.

3. This is just ridiculous.  So, you have more sophisticated thugs and are supporting cultural differences?  

4. There is the discussion of Gun legislation and then there is the discussion of Economics of Guns.  Those two are vastly different.  I find those people that discuss the former without the latter to be most dangerous. The reality is guns are here in the USA and will be for generations whether you make a Ban or not.  So those of you that think Laws will make a difference for this culture of violence are just wanting to harm good people, imo.

The Mexican Thugs/Gangs/Organized Crime has no problem getting their hands on guns even though it's illegal in their country.  Now I'm not a fool, I'm sure the USA is a major supplier BUT who is going to be if the USA bans guns.  And that's the ticket, is the USA is a huge market and no one talks about the economics.  There is already a HUGE supply so banning or legislating guns will not do anything for decades.  Then when it does make a difference it will only affect those not willing to challenge the ban and/or those without the cash.  Bottom line is where there are drugs = guns = deaths.

People who are excluded from purchasing firearms under this system are people who have been convicted of serious crimes, been convicted of drug offenses, been involuntarily committed to a mental institution, and undocumented immigrants or immigrants out of visa status.

In the Holmes case, he had seen mental health professionals, but he had never been involuntarily committed to psychiatric care, so (under the current system) there was no record or cause to deny his firearms purchases.

The health care system is very decentralized in the USA, and there is an emphasis on patient privacy (at least privacy from government). As long as there is no coherent national health system, I reckon it would be difficult to have some kind of system to ""flag"" those currently under treatment for psychological conditions.

Of course, these regulations are all around firearms transfers through federally licensed dealers. Most states allow private transfers without any registration or background check. The only requirement is that the buyer and seller live in the same state, and both are over the age of 18. For example, I've sold an AR-15 to a guy I met through the internet.

true,mielove,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;You know what would get you a lot closer to getting rid of ""barbaric"" halal slaughter? (Which, by the way, is a small part of ""halal."")  
  
It's already illegal in Sweden. Muslim and Jewish groups have joined together quite recently to campaign against it. It's also been proposed that we ban ritual male circumcision too (most doctors already refuse to perform it for non-medical reasons). Said groups again got upset and see it as an attack against them and their religion. 
  
And that's the problem in a nutshell. Mainstream Swedish society sees such laws as protecting the rights of animals and children (which trump the right to religion since the right to religion only pertains to the individual). There is no compromise to this view on either side.

illness to carry concealed handguns deters violent crimes and appears to produce

the rest country had adopted right-to-carry concealed handgun provisions in

I'd like to expand on this argument. I know that even if somebody broke into my home while I'm there, I'd still be pretty safe.

In the US, the robber would have to assume that I had a gun and would be likely to use it, and therefore it would make sense to bring a gun of his own, which he could easily do. This means a confrontation would be potentially life threatening for both parties.  
Here, even if I had a (legal) gun, I would be required to keep it in a safe, and I would have a very hard time arguing self-defense even if I would manage to get it out and ready to shoot in time. So, bringing a gun would serve little purpose but to increase the sentence significantly if he got caught. Also, police would throw much more resources at the case. A knife would almost certainly be enough to keep me away and make a retreat possible (but still increase the sentence).

You will see many American Redditors repeating the same NRA taking points without even realizing that they come right out of NRA press releases.

These include: 



If someone is going to kill, they're going to kill whatever weapon they use.



Cars (etc) kill people so should we ban cars?


Guns don't kill people, people kill people.



If  guns where taken away only criminals would have guns.




They're the sort of arguments where English can be manipulated seemingly without end. You engage in these arguments and they go around in circles.







What's at the root here, even amongst progressives is a defeatist attitude that the world is violent and nothing can be done.
In the US we are saturated with violent images daily on the local news and most American Redditors are white males who indulge in violent fantsies all day playing video games.

When I lived in Australia I was shocked at how the media talked about this small boy named Mocrombie who was kidnapped and then found dead. He was treated with such reverence. In America children are abducted and killed everyday and it phases us for a second and then we forget. In Australia this boy brought an entire nation to a halt and everyone mourned for him. He wasn't famous or rich. He wasn't a child beauty pageant contestant or an aspiring model. His parents weren't shady characters. But everyone paid attention because it was horrible.

I don't know how sucessful people like me will be on this issue.

So what you get is all moderates and intillectuals grouped into the liberal camp and they automaticaly lose their earnest credibility because the general consensus seems to be ""oh well both parties suck, can't trust anyone.""  

I recommend reading ""It's Even Worse than it Looks.""  It's been labeled a liberal book because it's research comes to the conclusion that Republicans are the main problem.  One of the authors is a conservative working for a conservative think tank. But because the books conclusion wasn't ""both sides are to blame"" CNN wouldn't touch it (unless they agreed to have ANOTHER conservative on to simply disagree with the conservative who wrote the book) and only Dan Rather and MSNBC gave the book and its authors (both accomplished academics from both sides of the political spectrum and working in Wahlshington since the 60's...these weren't fly by night ""hey let's write a book bshing republicans"" kind of guys) any attention.

true,Jedibeeftrix,null,null,"It boils down to a decision society makes on the 'proper' balance between negative liberty and positive liberty.

An example or two:

Your right to property ownership and its inviolability within the law (my home is my castle), versus the states right to demand access on the grounds of (potential) child abuse/debt/etc.

Your right to trial by jury versus the states right to revoke jury trial in order to protect vital intelligence.

Your right to drink alcohol at whatever the market price for it is, versus the states right to impose minimum pricing in order to protect those from themselves who would abuse alcohol to detriment of themselves and others.

Your right to own items that are (potentially) dangerous if misused, versus  the states right to place limits on the ownership of such items in order to enhance public protection (from the consequence of their misuse).

The US has always leaned strongly towards negative liberty, and arguably the continent has gone equally strongly in the other direction of positive liberty. Britain by contrast has always been in the middle.

This can be seen in practice when we look at a nations basic concept of the state, in my experience europeans typically see the state as an enabler and guarantor of their rights and protections, whereas Britain looks to treaties that protect the people's rights from [the tyranny of] the state. The US obviously takes this distrust of the state to an even higher level.

There is no right or wrong answer to this, by and large society gets the state it wants and deserves.

Speaking personally, I am personally glad as a Britain that we have the example of the US to provide a counterweight to that of europe, for no nation exists in isolation and without that example our own expectations would drift into conformance with europe.

I like our basic wariness of the (overpowerful) state, it places natural limits on how much money we will tolerate being removed in taxation, and thus how much power the gov't has to intervene in our lives.

To sum up; can you say in public, hand on heart, that you accept that strong property rights will result in more horror stories of abuse, more terrorist atrocities, more lives blighted by alcohol abuse, and more massacres from unstable people who had access to dangerous items, and hold it an acceptable price to pay for [my] individual freedoms? 

I can say this.

&gt;(b) The classes of the militia are—

&gt;(1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and

&gt;(2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.

The UK and Canada also use winner-take-all, but have places like Quebec or Northern Ireland, which consider themselves apart from the larger nation and form region specific 3rd parties.

Concerning food, keep in mind that German restaurant prices are always tax and service charge included - you tip around 5-10% depending on how happy you were with the service, but if they are complete assholes you could also not tip at all without feeling bad (waiters don't depend on tips for their income as they do in the US).

Then, you add a hefty teaspoon of coffee inside and stir it up. Once you've done that, return the whole thing onto the heat and while stirring gently, wait for it to start boiling again. This is the tricky part and it separates the best from the rest. Ideally, you want to lower the temperature of the stove about a third before you put the dzezva back. Stirring the coffee gently while it's boiling will produce the nice cream on the top. You leave that on for about 2-3 minutes, and then proceed to take the thick cream off the top and distribute it evenly among all the cups. Once tit's evenly distributed, pour the rest of the coffee. So remember, don't let the water start boiling like crazy, lower the temperature a bit, and feel free to add a full teaspoon or even 2, to a small dzezva of coffee.

Lol oh god you're trolling right? And North and South Korea?! Really? I though i was trying to have a argument with a Portuguese Republican for some reason, but you're other crazy or just trolling here.

&gt; Besides being economically better, the free market is also morally superior since it's based on voluntary interaction and respect for human freedom and private property.

Lol yes, look at the gasoline market, it's so free and works so well and you have so much choice. Next year you'll have your wish with electricity and we'll see how brilliant it is to just leave private companies decide how much essential services should cost without and regulation.

&gt; Their not following these policies out of a sadistic pleasure of seeing the people suffer, their following them because there's no other way out of this crisis... It would be much easier for the government to increase social spending/decrease taxes and increase their odds of getting re-elected, but they just can't afford that.

I'm sorry, but if you think they have any empathy, you're blind. Gaspar only sees numbers, Passos Coelho gets a boner everytime he hears Merkel's name and Relvas is just trying to make his and his friends bright future post government. Gaspar may be the only one that actually believes in what he is doing because he's fanatic enough. 

&gt; Or maybe they will find another job and keep on with their life, we can't afford so many public servants and it makes no sense to keep them employed because we fear they may not find their own way. You have to believe in their capacity and understand that there's no other way... For all intents and purposes the only thing between us and bankruptcy is the Troika and we must deal with our debt crisis now rather than later since our debt is like a snow ball that just keeps growing. We have a very short time frame to get our shit together before our debt reaches a unsustainable point where a default becomes inevitable (which may have already happened, but that's a whole other discussion)...

You forget that while those public servants are working they are paying taxes and contributing for the economy, while when they are unemployed they will just be a ""burden"". If they will be better if working on the private sector then why doesn't the private sector hire them? Because no one is hiring anyone right now, especially more than a 3months contract!
We have almost 16% unemployment rate, and over 120.000 young people immigrated this year, and the deficit is getting bigger and we're getting deeper in recession. This measures are not working. I dunno what to tell you to show none of the troika's supported measures or the gov's own initiatives have failed, because they haven't got anything right. You cannot keep applying the same recipe over and over when it keeps failing, it's insanity.

&gt; Not if you austerity centers around liberalizing the work market and leaving more wealth into the private sector... 

How is the liberalized work market produces wealth to the actual workers and not just the big companies? It's easier to fire someone than ever, and how many jobs did that created exactly? How many people are in non paid internships because why would companies pay someone when they can have someone working for free and then replace them every 3 moths for free? 

&gt; Either way what alternatives do we have? We are broke! Cutting spending is all that's left for us to do and although I agree that we should start with non essential things of which there are plenty, there's no doubt in my mind that social spending will also have to receive cuts. The old paradigm where the state took care of us is dying and a new is being born where individual responsibility takes more relevance.

You can renegotiate the conditions to pay the loan, you can have the conditions Greece got right now, with no interests for a period of time, or lower interests and extend the period to pay the totality, so we're not 'forced' to implement bad measures that will just make us go deeper into recession and get a 2nd loan soon.
Most of european countries, Canada, etc, have several socialist implemented measures who work fine, just because some governments were corrupt doesn't invalidate this model in no way, just means we need to have better transparency and fix everything that we did wrong. Self responsibility is very nice to say, if you're really prepared to let people starve because they were ""irresponsible"" and did bad choices. I'm not ready for that kind of society.

C) Knowing to what extent your country monitors you, especially on the internet, is a pointless exercise, especially if you try and rank them.

Because it's in the US Constitution, and lots of Americans have a nearly religious belief in the US Constitution and their ""Founding Fathers"". They think that the US Consitution is the best thing every and is the only thing really protecting them from massive tyranny and that no other country has any kind of legal document as amazing as the US Constituion and that it was the first document to have such amazing liberty.

Hence they can't really admit that there's anything wrong with the US Consitution or that the Founding Fathers got anything wrong. All debates are about ""What did the Founding Fathers really mean?"".

It's quite simple really - you wait until trees start to recover from winter and then drill a small hole in it to get the juices out (i believe 5 cm deep hole should be enough). Put in a tap or pipe for juice to run along and a bucket or bottle on other end. A cloth filter can be placed between tap and bottle to prevent stuff falling in there but can be filtered afterwards as well. The output varies on trees and time of year but its not a fast process in any case. After you done jam it shut with some cork so you don't damage the tree so much. Its very easy and doesn't take almost any effort.

I love J.K. Rowling's thoughts on this:  
  
&gt;I chose to remain a domiciled taxpayer for a couple of reasons. The main one was that I wanted my children to grow up where I grew up, to have proper roots in a culture as old and magnificent as Britain’s; to be citizens, with everything that implies, of a real country, not free-floating ex-pats, living in the limbo of some tax haven and associating only with the children of similarly greedy tax exiles.

&gt;A second reason, however, was that I am indebted to the British welfare state; the very one that Mr Cameron would like to replace with charity handouts. When my life hit rock bottom, that safety net, threadbare though it had become under John Major’s Government, was there to break the fall. I cannot help feeling, therefore, that it would have been contemptible to scarper for the West Indies at the first sniff of a seven-figure royalty cheque.

With a 75% tax rate you don't need to earn many millions per year before the first few steps become irrelevant and the actual paid taxrate is close to the top-level.

Don't forget VAT, that comes on top of the outrageous 75% he's already paid.

When I troll I don't tend to write such long posts... What you pay for SS is not the money you'll get when you retire, it's what will be used to pay current and near future expenditures. The SS as I said also promises more than It can accomplish and just like a ponzi scheme that works whilst the tax base is increasing, but then when it stops increasing the whole system starts to collapse and you either raise taxes or cut benefits.

&gt;And North and South Korea?! Really? I though i was trying to have a argument with a Portuguese Republican for some reason, but you're other crazy or just trolling here.

They're pretty good examples of a society that allows the free market to work and another that centralizes everything on the state and the outcomes are pretty damn visible... One has gone through massive growth and increase in quality of life and another is a hell on earth where humans have been reduced to cattle.

&gt;Lol yes, look at the gasoline market, it's so free and works so well and you have so much choice. Next year you'll have your wish with electricity and we'll see how brilliant it is to just leave private companies decide how much essential services should cost without and regulation.

Look at all the taxes on gasoline and then tell me something... Competition is what drives prices down, in gasoline there is not that much competition and that coupled with taxes is why we pay so much.

&gt;I'm sorry, but if you think they have any empathy, you're blind. Gaspar only sees numbers, Passos Coelho gets a boner everytime he hears Merkel's name and Relvas is just trying to make his and his friends bright future post government. Gaspar may be the only one that actually believes in what he is doing because he's fanatic enough.

So I'm assuming you know them personally and not just from the TV and leftist blogs?

&gt;You forget that while those public servants are working they are paying taxes and contributing for the economy, while when they are unemployed they will just be a ""burden""

They're paying taxes on income that they received from taxes, that's like drinking your own piss.

&gt;If they will be better if working on the private sector then why doesn't the private sector hire them?

Because the work market is filled with rules and bureaucracy that creates a hostile environment for hiring, specially when there are other countries in Europe and the world that are far better places to invest.

If we got rid of the minimum wage, made it easier to fire people and reduced taxes on companies then we would have a more friendly environment and slowly more jobs would be created. There's no magic bullet to our unemployment problem but there are steps that we can take to slowly address it. I know nobody wants to see wages go down but there's clearly a lack of demand for labor and excessive supply, so that's what will have to happen if we want unemployment to go down. Otherwise will just have to keep subsidizing the unemployed when they could be taking care of themselves and acquiring work experience.

&gt;How is the liberalized work market produces wealth to the actual workers and not just the big companies?

The same way a baker produces good bread to get his money. For the big companies to grow wealthy they must provide you with a quality service that you're willing to purchase, this competition between companies for your money leads to increasingly better products for lower prices and slowly the pie grows for everyone.

Hell, I'm sure I live better nowadays than a CEO 100 years ago... If that's not proof that capitalism slowly increases the quality of life of everyone then I dunno what is.

&gt;How many people are in non paid internships because why would companies pay someone when they can have someone working for free and then replace them every 3 moths for free? 

You get what you pay for. A experienced employee will not sell his services for free and will have higher productivity than someone who is doing an internship. On the other hand the person who is doing the internship is gaining skills that will allow them to get better jobs in the future.

I will agree that in some areas it's pretty damn hard to get a legitimate job, but it's the responsibility of each person to know what their getting themselves into.

&gt;Self responsibility is very nice to say, if you're really prepared to let people starve because they were ""irresponsible"" and did bad choices. I'm not ready for that kind of society.

There are more people starving in commanded economies than in more capitalistic ones and don't assume that I would deny food to anyone. There's no reason why people should starve in a first world country and I would have no problems if the state stepped in to prevent that in case charity is incapable to do so.",0,1355674554,null,0,false,0,c7hgbs2,t3_14tpki,t1_c7hgbs2,t1_c7hfp5r,null,1430688802,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

In Defense of the Gun in this Current Situation

Guns kill people. But this is not about guns. This is about the problems the Connecticut killer faced that ultimately made his decision. I don’t know where I stand on the gun issue, but I can tell you this, that man wouldn’t have stopped if guns were barred. I could say he would illegally obtain it, but disregarding that, he would simply use another tool, like a knife or other such weapons. The point is, banning guns doesn’t stop this.

The thing to remember is thatmental health issues are a real thing.You ask, “What sane man does such a thing?” The answer is that no sane man DOES do such a thing. The guy was not right in the head and didn’t probably get cared for, or did not recieve any attention to his mental health, or even he himself was not aware that he had a mental illness. The US does not get any coverage on mental issues, and that’s a big problem.

It saddens me that everyone gets a Kony knee jerk reaction and raises their arm to bellow that we must have gun control. But why do you not address that the US does not have a mental healthcare system in this country, excluding prisons? It’s not even confirmed if the killer was insane, but as I analyze what I see, it seems to be the case. To reiterate, guns kill, but the insane use them for such inhumane purposes.

I suppose it goes without saying that I need to remind the general public that personal defense guns save many, many goddamn lives. I assume everyone understands these stories do not get anywhere NEAR the coverage something of this magnitude does, and in fact, sometimes it might not get any other coverage. Do guns do more good than harm or vice versa? I don’t have the statistics to back the following statement, but in my belief they do more good, and not just good, but for laid back shooting at a range, which I very much enjoy.

Ah… this essay is getting all over this place. Let me wrap it up by saying that I feel extreme sympathy towards the dead, the wounded, the families, and even the killer, for I am terribly disappointed his mental problem took control and led him astray. If he had gotten help, maybe this could’ve been entirely avoided. Finally, please, if you know anybody who has gone through something extremely traumatic or is showing some very different, very odd tendencies of late, or both, please convince them to see someone. And if you yourself are not thinking straight and are thinking very dark thoughts, see someone as well. We don’t want this to happen again.

We have no perfect party either, unfortunately. Our green party is cpmpletely out of touch with reality half or the time (think tin foil hats...)

&gt;""A voted for B, and B supports position X, therefore A supports X"". 

Well, yes, sometimes you can. One can't claim when one voted for Bush the second time that one didn't know one voted *for* the Iraq war. One can't vote for the Egyptian constitution now and say one do not know that one vote against women's right. One can't vote for Netanyahu, and say that you are voting for peace with the Palestinians. If one is claiming those things, one is either delusional or a lier. It is the same with the French. The CAP takes up 44% of the EU budget, billions, and by far the biggest post. The French can not claim *anything* with regards to fairness, sound finances or sensible economics within the EU, as long as they are defending the current CAP. It is hypocracy at its finest. And, it is not like the French don't know, they just do not care about it. One can't always blame the politicians, the people have to take responsibliity too, and yes, just like I blame the Egyptian voting against women's right, I blame the French for the CAP.

&gt;However unfortunately French people in general have reactionary opinions, and are not particularly in favor of fairness as long as they get the best end of the deal, despite what the motto of our republic says.

The stories (which often overlap):

* Mentally ill (both natural, like schizophrenia, and inflicted, like PTSD)
* Disabled
* Poor or no family support structure
* Drug addict
* Economically screwed - those who would work, but can't get hired
* The completely complicit - those who just plain want to be homeless

What I think helps:

* Treatment and rehabilitation facilities. As much as possible, we should help people be better, not just manage their problems.
* Public or private assistance with job transitions (retraining, work placement, etc).
* Easily accessible emergency assistance for food, medicine, clothing, and shelter.
* A recognition from society that these people are people too. They probably made some bad choices to get where they are, but that does not invalidate their basic humanity. 

The actual implementation of my preferred ideas is still very, very much up for debate. What would be great would be to take an experimental approach to these programs. We should state the goals, and see how a variety of approaches are effective, ineffective, or harmful toward reaching those goals. Then, we should publish the results and implement the most effective techniques.

If they didn't want to help, the least they could do is point her to the wagon and told her they are sorry but really busy. In a nice way.

The boss needs to know this shit. We have good employment protection in Germany. But maybe someone else, who is nicer to customers, would like to have a go at the job. 

I personally can't stand people being shitty to customers. If my employees would be shitty towards me and nice to customers I would promote them. 

Problem is most likely that Obi is a corporation. People get promoted because they are nice to their boss, not nice to the customer. Because it's all politics. Corporations usually have little to do with free market or shit like that. They are usually not run like a business anyways, but rather like a country. A feudalist country that is. And that is a pretty shitty way to run a country. So most likely the boss don't give a shit about their customers. At least not the local boss.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;But full blown assault rifles...

It's always nice to hear from the clueless. It is *""possible""* to own one of these, but they are rare, and cost $20,000 and up. This is a fully automatic, select fire weapon, which requires extensive paperwork, permits, and they're highly regulated. They are also *manufactured*, not ""blown"". You may be thinking of glass products.

&gt;It has been unlawful since 1934 (The National Firearms Act) for civilians to own machine guns without special permission from the U.S. Treasury Department. Machine guns are subject to a $200 tax every time their ownership changes from one federally registered owner to another, and each new weapon is subject to a manufacturing tax when it is made, and it must be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in its National Firearms Registry.

&gt;To become a registered owner, a complete FBI background investigation is conducted, checking for any criminal history or tendencies toward violence, and an application must be submitted to the ATF including two sets of fingerprints, a recent photo, a sworn affidavit that transfer of the NFA firearm is of ""reasonable necessity,"" and that sale to and possession of the weapon by the applicant ""would be consistent with public safety."" The application form also requires the signature of a chief law enforcement officer with jurisdiction in the applicant's residence.

&gt;Since the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of May 19, 1986, ownership of newly manufactured machine guns has been prohibited to civilians. Machine guns which were manufactured prior to the Act's passage are regulated under the National Firearms Act, but those manufactured after the ban cannot ordinarily be sold to or owned by civilians.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;So the next question is do you have a full overview of the complete production chain for all those products?

If it says ""made in China"" or ""made in Indonesia"" then one can't plead ignorance, it's well known how the labour laws are in these countries and the moment you buy something knowing full well under the conditions it was made, you can't excuse yourself saying you didn't know.

Don't be like those hypocrites who sometimes do cocaine and then say the government ought to do more against the drug cartels - if you buy, you're part of the problem.

&gt;Do you even have an overview of the production chains for the products you regularly buy? Are you sure the information you do have about the products you buy and their production chain is accurate(its not reasonable to expect producers to advertice negative aspects of their product)?

That is already regulated, the producers can't lie to the consumers about their products. If you buy an ipod or something like that even thought it's on the news how they treat the workers who make these in South-east Asia, then don't say ""oh, I didn't know"", you know full well, it's your fault and the fault of the rest of the buyers - I can guarantee you that if nobody bought these because of how they were made, then this situation would stop overnight as nobody would benefit from this.

&gt;What is important is that all of these actors have power to significantly reduce the problem and they are all parts in the system and they directly or indirectly cause, benefit and take harm from these negative aspects.

The only actors here that can make a difference are the consumers, while they continue to choose to buy these products, companies that provide them will benefit and companies that don't provide them will lose business.",0,1355678025,null,0,false,0,c7hh1xi,t3_14xngc,t1_c7hh1xi,t1_c7hff1e,null,1430689146,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

Again just because there's a bunch of incompetent/ corrupt guys ruining Social security doesn't make it a failure. It worked well until now, and it works fine on all other countries. Give me an example of a country where there is no state run option for social security at all and it works wonderfully as you purpose? There is none. 
And a dictatorship is not an example you can compare, we are talking democracies here, so that is ridiculous. Give me an example of a country where there is a complete free market and unregulated capitalism and it works greatly as you purpose. Because you keep giving me these 'great liberal capitalist ideals', but where were they all implemented and were successful?

&gt; Look at all the taxes on gasoline and then tell me something... Competition is what drives prices down, in gasoline there is not that much competition and that coupled with taxes is why we pay so much.

Then look at the price raises that happen after the market was liberalized and tell me it's not all the companies agreeing on the prices to profit more? Yes our taxes are bigger on our country then on some, but that doesn't explain the dramatic price spikes. But on regulated markets the prices are always lower, so tell me how does the unregulated market help the consumer? They still had the same choices with the regulated market, but now we have to pay almost double to fill the tank. 

&gt; So I'm assuming you know them personally and not just from the TV and leftist blogs?

This has nothing to do with my political allegiance but because i'm a honest human being, and these people make me sick. Please don't tell me you actually defend this government, because if you say you think Relvas is a competent and honest politician you loose all the credibility i'm giving you. Would he be in a different country he would have the decency to quit his position and disappear from the public life after his first scandal, but sadly he's in Portugal where he'll manage to be a joke forever while helping to sell all our public companies cheaply to his buddies.

&gt; If we got rid of the minimum wage, made it easier to fire people and reduced taxes on companies then we would have a more friendly environment and slowly more jobs would be created.

Yes let's become the China of Europe, congratulations you managed to be as radical as our finance minister.
How is not having a legal minimum wage gonna make companies pay better? Are you living in the moon? Have you seen the contract proposals companies offer? someone with 5years of experience, master's degree, fluency in various languages and they offer a 3 month contract with 485€.  How is this helpful? Big companies like Sonae, Jeronimo martins, etc had more profits than ever, yet they hire people with this conditions. This isn't the law's fault. Although the Gov is helping making someone's work as precarious as possible. Again it's easier than ever to fire someone. Again tell me where on the world there's no minimum wage and companies are just as generous they pay very well?!

&gt; You get what you pay for. A experienced employee will not sell his services for free and will have higher productivity than someone who is doing an internship. On the other hand the person who is doing the internship is gaining skills that will allow them to get better jobs in the future.

Again, go to a job search site and tell me where this is happening? Someone will always be desperate enough to accept a very low offer, because they have to eat, pay house, etc, so this argument is very naive. An experience employee will accept any offer right now because they run the risk of not having anything at all. Companies in general aren't staying with employees long term. Simply because it's cheaper to replace them with another one for a short term contract.
And you can't say it's all some areas fault they have lower employment rates. We have medical doctors emigrating right now because they can't get a job. Your argument is invalid. 

&gt; There are more people starving in commanded economies than in more capitalistic ones and don't assume that I would deny food to anyone. There's no reason why people should starve in a first world country and I would have no problems if the state stepped in to prevent that in case charity is incapable to do so.

Again why are you bringing ""commanded economies"" to this argument? Most democratic countries have some sort of capitalist economy so you can start telling me how some work better than others, what i'm saying is completely unregulated capitalist added to a monopolized system like in our country isn't gonna help anyone but the administrators of the winning companies. And yes there's no reason people should starve in a first world country, that's why the state should step in before ""charity"".  And some organizations who work non profit can help reaching where the state can't in time, but we shouldn't expect charity to replace social safety nets.

This is not true, only few countries links citizenship to taxes (the US being the big case). In the case of France renouncing french citizenship has basically no effect tax wise.

What is firstly taken into consideration when considering where you should be taxed:

-the place where the assets being taxed are located (what is in France is going to be taxed in France no matter what).

-the place where you and your familly is living (you can not easily fake this one).

-the place where you are working (hard to fake).

-the place where the center of your economic interest is located (very hard to hide).

true,maschlue,NRW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"I agree with what the others said, that it is not usual for employees in Germany to do more than what their job description says.

But there is also the fact that Germans are very frugal. This has caused shops like Aldi to exist, where everything is on palletts and you are supposed to do pretty much everything yourself. The products are not neatly displayed in the shelves and the whole store has a whole-sale feel to it. All the employees do is cleaning, rolling in palletts of stuff and ringing you up. You will have to bend your knees to get your products, you will have to bag your groceries and you will have to do it quickly.

I think that all this that is very different to how things are run in the US, is pretty much expected in Germany. I think if your mom had asked nicely and explained herself (I hurt myself, I can't physically do this... etc), the employees of that hardware store should have happily helped her. But it is in no way expected, because, just like Aldi, helping yourself as much as possible is expected.

If someone from a store helps you more than is usual, a ""Trinkgeld"" (Tip) is not really out of the order. That is why the frugal German will not ask for help at all. And everyone at least believes that this behaviour will keep the prices down.

&gt; Unless you'd like to argue that there were people a couple-hundred years ago that decided that a device to overthrow a malign government should be controlled by that same government it was meant to be used against.
If you'd like to make that argument, I would love to hear the reasoning and/or explanation behind it. It should be quite educational.  
  
Here's the deal, at the drafting of this constitution nobody feared their state government. They were as afraid of an oppressive state-government as they were an oppressive local-government. The entire Federalist anti-Federalist debate was really over reassuring the American people that a federal government under the proposed constitution would not be powerful enough to discriminate and oppress single states.   
The civil war proves these fears; the revolution against the government was indeed manufactured by the state governments themselves. [State governments would be the imagined conduit between the people and the protection against the federal government.](http://www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/pubs/10/ngr10_4.pdf) Just think of the militias that were organized leading up-to and during the Revolution. They were organized and met-regularly but did not hold demonstrations in towns or carry their flintlock pistols into the market square. We can at least agree that a militia does not imply individuals carrying weapons in public spaces for protection.   
  
In fact, the draft passed by congress before ratification of states [had capitalized Militia and States giving them a proper-noun status, i.e. a clearly visible organized militia and the States specifically meaning the 13 states of the United States, not the country in general.](http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt2_user.html)  
  
&gt; Also, if you're going to talk about militias, you should probably also talk about 10 USC § 311[1] - Militia: composition and classes.  
  
Essentially this code says citizens shall be able to bear arms, and I do agree with that. But that code/classification says nothing of owning weapons for personal-protection or carrying weapons into public as an active deterrent against crime.  
  
The NRA and other 2nd-Amendment organizations have extended the meaning and original purpose of gun-ownership from ""citizens being prepared to fight a rotten government"" to ""we should give guns to kids on campus"".

Not all products made in China or Indonesia are made under terrible conditions this reactionary approach will only hurt developing economies by boycotting them without discriminating. Many products made in the west contain parts that are made in Indonesia and China under poor conditions that you will never be aware of.

&gt;That is already regulated, the producers can't lie to the consumers about their products.

Have you ever picked up a pair of adidas sneakers and read on the box
""These shoes were made under terrible conditions in the phillipines?""

Does it say on your Romanian produced Nokia telephone that it contains blood minerals from Africa?

Do you think average Joe has time to research every ingredient supplier involved in the production of every precooked meal he buys?

&gt;The only actors here that can make a difference are the consumers.

It should be painfully obvious by now that the only solution you for some reason think is possible, is not working at all. 

We can however limit the problem by other means or make it easier for consumers to make the right choice:

&gt;But on regulated markets the prices are always lower

What? Are you saying that for example TAP and RTP provide the same service as Ryanair or TVI but cost less to run? lol!

&gt;Yes let's become the China of Europe, congratulations you managed to be as radical as our finance minister. How is not having a legal minimum wage gonna make companies pay better? Are you living in the moon?

[Germany doesn't have a minimum wage like we do. Nor does Austria. Nor does Denmark. Nor does Sweden. Nor does Finland.](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-QA-09-029/EN/KS-QA-09-029-EN.PDF) Yet all these countries are in a much better situation than we are.

[Here, watch this small video by Milton Friedman about the minimum wage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca8Z__o52sk).

&gt;Again it's easier than ever to fire someone.

No, it's not, it's still harder to fire 5 workers than it is to shut down a plant, it's no coincidence that here companies just suddenly close doors without giving any signs of warning.

Companies have to pay massive subsidies to employees and they need a reason to fire people, which is all fine and dandy from a social perspective but from a business perspective it makes it very hard to fire people meaning companies are much more cautious when hiring and that older workers who might even no longer do their work properly aren't fired because it would cost the company a lot of money to fire old timers whereas they have a much easier time in firing younger people who are working there for less time simply because even though they might be more productive, the company doesn't have to pay as much in benefits to young workers.

&gt;Again tell me where on the world there's no minimum wage and companies are just as generous they pay very well?!

What? Even in Portugal, if the minimum wage is 470€*14 and you're paid, for example, 800€, if the minimum wage were to be abolished, you'd receive just the same. It's only a minimum, it doesn't actually bring the wage rates up. Regardless, the pdf I posted a few paragraphs back has several examples within the EU itself.

&gt; Someone will always be desperate enough to accept a very low offer, because they have to eat, pay house, etc, so this argument is very naive.

So you're saying to desperate people ""we know you're desperate for money but we can't let you work for less than 470€*14, you'll have to get by being unemployed"", which is insane, if you're actually trying to help people, then you're doing it all wrong, unemployment isn't a better choice than a relatively low wage!

&gt;what i'm saying is completely unregulated capitalist added to a monopolized system like in our country isn't gonna help anyone but the administrators of the winning companies.

The monopolies we have are the state-run ones. If you deregulated and allowed them to compete against the private sector, I'm sure a lot of other companies would show up - a good example of this were the TVs, back in the days there was only RTP but now the market has been slightly deregulated and the state-monopoly is over.",0,1355682867,null,0,false,0,c7hi909,t3_14tpki,t1_c7hi909,t1_c7hh3ie,null,1430689709,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;HURR DURR YOU SUPPORT TAXES? YOU PARASITE HURR DURR. 

I'm talking about these 75% taxes, which you seem to support.

If you tax at a fair rate and tell me ""it's to pay for the public lighting, it's to pay for the policemen and the firemen, it's to pay for the education and the healthcare of everyone, it's to keep the courts running and the roads free"", sure, I support those taxes, everyone does, it's paying to get something in return, just like I pay the baker when I buy bread. Who'd ever not want this?

However, if you tax some much more than others, you don't disclose anything about where you'll spend all the money and instead make demands and empty threats, accusing those who don't want to pay such absurd values like 75% of unpatriotic and greedy, then I'm sorry but you're wrong, I fully reject this.

Why should a person work to see the product of his labour taken away by the government and then come to find out that his hard earned money which he never got to enjoy was instead spent on useless submarines or airfields in the middle of nothing or subsidies to breast implants surgeries or football stadiums for a single event or on new top-of-the-line cars for the deputies of the Assembly of the Republic or on higher wages for the directors of state-run companies like the TV or national airline company (all these examples of public mismanagement of money that happened here in Portugal) then I wonder, how could anyone ever support these massive taxes? It's for more of this shit that the people who actually work have to suck it up and continue to work the same for less and less? Why don't we first focus on minimising the already massive spending and, once the waste is contained, do increase taxes if we really have to in order to keep the state running?",0,1355684505,null,0,false,0,c7hipgg,t3_14xvzf,t1_c7hipgg,t1_c7higt5,null,1430689927,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

And if wishes were horses, we'd all be eating steak.

It's not like he decided ""Yeah, I'm gonna be bitchy and ruin this womens day!"". How we approach our feelings and worries is result of our upbringing, culture and many other factors. You don't usually make a conscious decision.

Another factor is, that most likely there were two different cultures colliding with different expectations, approaches to conflict and maybe even body language. A german might have interpreted the helpers actions and behaviour very differently. And the helper might have percieved the OPs mother very differently than she intended.

The guy might actually not have been as unfriendly as percieved. People from a different cultural background often appear ""fake"", ""slimy"", ""rude"", ""overly friendly"", ""uninterested"", ... even though to someone from their own culture this behaviour appears completly normal.

An assault rifle is a well defined term, completely *unlike* the term 'assault weapon'. The second means, black, scary, has parts and stuff... The first, the assault rifle, is a select fire, fully automatic, military weapon. Private ownership is *highly* restricted, and the price tag starts in the multiple tens of thousands of dollars. Here, read this about the problem *assault rifles*:

&gt;It has been unlawful since 1934 (The National Firearms Act) for civilians to own machine guns without special permission from the U.S. Treasury Department. Machine guns are subject to a $200 tax every time their ownership changes from one federally registered owner to another, and each new weapon is subject to a manufacturing tax when it is made, and it must be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in its National Firearms Registry.

&gt;To become a registered owner, a complete FBI background investigation is conducted, checking for any criminal history or tendencies toward violence, and an application must be submitted to the ATF including two sets of fingerprints, a recent photo, a sworn affidavit that transfer of the NFA firearm is of ""reasonable necessity,"" and that sale to and possession of the weapon by the applicant ""would be consistent with public safety."" The application form also requires the signature of a chief law enforcement officer with jurisdiction in the applicant's residence.

&gt;Since the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of May 19, 1986, ownership of newly manufactured machine guns has been prohibited to civilians. Machine guns which were manufactured prior to the Act's passage are regulated under the National Firearms Act, but those manufactured after the ban cannot ordinarily be sold to or owned by civilians.

&gt;If we're working within the framework of ""sanity"", then contributing more when you have more is a perfect example of a sane and responsible system.

How is paying 75% in taxes a ""sane and responsible system""? Don't get me wrong - I am not against helping a little those who want to work but cannot for one or another reason. The taxes are supposed both to finance general society needs and to work as a premium for state  insurance (read: to get state benefits or pension when needed).

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Wait, what? Where did I write that?

That's what we're talking about, it all started when you mentioned a possible race to the bottom that could happen if people could move to places with lower taxes.

I tried to refute this, I think it's quite obvious that, if anything, precisely because people can avoid this by moving elsewhere, that's what prevents governments from instituting massive taxes like 75% or 100%, like what's now happening in France, in trying to constantly increase taxes as opposed to keep them at a reasonable rate and minimising their expenditures instead, they're having this new problem - and it isn't certainly leading to a race to the bottom, it's actually what's preventing a race to the top in terms of taxation.

&gt;I would tell you my ideology about the taxing system but that'll be a story for another day.

Ok, one day you'll tell me that, I'm actually interested in discussing those. Though it's quite obvious that we have different views, you seem quite reasonable, it should be good. :)

&gt;Unfortunately, like you wrote, most of the people thinks that their fair tax rate is 0%.

If you get something from the government (and we all do, we don't live in an anarchy), then the tax rate can't be 0%, it's wouldn't be fair to not pay and to benefit from it.

What I said is that the optimal tax rate is the one that tends to 0, but I was just referring to minimising costs, and this also quite simple to understand, for example, if you were Depardieu and you could get the same benefits you get from the French state but in Belgium for a much smaller tax rate, why would you not?

Of course that this can get skewed up quite easily, it's all about the cost-benefit ratio and not simply the cost (aka the tax rate). That's why it's hard to determine an optimal tax rate, for example, the tax rates in a neighbouring country can be 5 or 10 percentage points lower but that state can have a worse justice system or a much lousier NHS and so you can't just look at the tax rate to determine what is best for a society.

Again, I fail to see an incentive to a race to the bottom like you described. Sure, there's an incentive to minimise costs like there is everywhere but there's certainly not an incentive to get careless with public safety or the accessibility of healthcare or education, that's why no matter how people might want to not pay taxes, there will always have to be some taxation, because people also always want some degree of these public goods and that costs money.

&gt;What I'm trying to do, is showing that Depardieu's problem isn't the fact that it is socially unfair for him to pay 75% income tax.

And I'm trying to argue from his position. He thinks that he has paid more than his fair share and that the government is getting careless and is going to recklessly spend more, and I get his position. I'd probably do the same if I had that kind of money and the government threatened to take that away from me and was openly hostile to people who had my level of income.

Wouldn't you do the same? Wouldn't you try to get away with not paying such massive taxes if you could? Or would you agree to such an increase in your taxation when things were fine as they were previously and now you'd have to pay much more but get no extra benefits?

&gt;Who decides what is fair? What is the fair tax rate for Depardieu? Or rich french/portuguese/wtv in general?

I certainly don't know what would be the fairest but it certainly wouldn't be to place such a disproportional burden on the few who are wealthy. A 75% tax rate, regardless of your income, certainly doesn't seem fair to me, I'll tell you that much.

I wouldn't worry so much about the money they do have, rich people aren't some weird kind, they don't take their money with them to the grave.",0,1355688547,null,0,false,0,c7hjtzz,t3_14xvzf,t1_c7hjtzz,t1_c7hj5d7,null,1430690522,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Here, watch this small video by Milton Friedman about the minimum wage.

Lol cute attempt http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/index.htm but all of those countries even if don't have a legal minimum wage they instead nationwide collective bargaining agreements set minimum wages by job classification for each industry or just negotiated between unions and employer associations. So nop it's not your free market paradise as employers setting minimum wage as they please as you're saying. Although i'm sure that in Germany for example non-union people are probably getting payed much less than they should. 

&gt;Here's a list, remove the top countries which produce oil and you'll see that the more they focus on the free market, the wealthier and more successful they are.

Lol all of those countries have some sort of public option of social security and healthcare so you're agreeing with me, having social  safety nets increases social mobility :)

&gt; No, it's not, it's still harder to fire 5 workers than it is to shut down a plant, it's no coincidence that here companies just suddenly close doors without giving any signs of warning.

Nop, just in january of this year the number of collective downsize on companies doubled http://www.publico.pt/economia/noticia/numero-de-empresas-em-despedimento-colectivo-quase-duplicou-em-janeiro--1535976 
And companies will always want cheaper labor, they came to Portugal before because at the time we were cheaper, they went to eastern europe for same reason, more recently china, and i'm sure too. You can't compete with cheaper labor, because you will always loose to developing countries. So i'm sorry companies won't come back to portugal because they can fire someone even easier, because they can have 5 chinese people or more doing the same job for the same wage.

&gt; What? Even in Portugal, if the minimum wage is 470€*14 and you're paid, for example, 800€, if the minimum wage were to be abolished, you'd receive just the same. It's only a minimum, it doesn't actually bring the wage rates up. Regardless, the pdf I posted a few paragraphs back has several examples within the EU itself.

Again you are talking about being paid above the average wage, but look at the facts http://www.jn.pt/PaginaInicial/Economia/Interior.aspx?content_id=2658883 engineers for example are being offered in average 500€, so how can you say if there was no minimum wage companies would pay more if they pay only as low as they legally can? 

&gt; So you're saying to desperate people ""we know you're desperate for money but we can't let you work for less than 470€*14, you'll have to get by being unemployed"", which is insane, if you're actually trying to help people, then you're doing it all wrong, unemployment isn't a better choice than a relatively low wage!

I'm saying people can't just flat out refuse lower wages and make a company offer more for a qualified professional because people need money, so they will accept any offer what so ever.
And for the record the minimum unemployment payment is 419€ which is less than the minimum wage so no one can refuse a job ""because they make more being unemployed"" 

&gt; The monopolies we have are the state-run ones. If you deregulated and allowed them to compete against the private sector, I'm sure a lot of other companies would show up - a good example of this were the TVs, back in the days there was only RTP but now the market has been slightly deregulated and the state-monopoly is over.

REN is a good example, how are you gonna privatize a company that  is the holder of the country's two main energy infrastructure networks gas and electricity? Anyone that buys  that company will always be successful. And no i don't think essential infrastructure should be privatized because you as a citizen already paid for it's construction.

&gt; What? Are you saying that for example TAP and RTP provide the same service as Ryanair or TVI but cost less to run? lol!

Lol yes actually TAP provides a better service as Ryanair, anyone who's fought with both companies would tell you that.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;First of all, it's not 75% of the income, it's only after a certain tax bracket. Second of all, 75% for someone who barely scrapes by is different for 75% for someone who earns as much as he does.

I'd like to see you win 100.000.000€ in the EuroMillions and not say a thing when 25.750.000€ got into your account.

Though even this example doesn't make my argument justice because it assumes that the first 1.000.000€ isn't taxed at all and is about a profit on a gamble, whereas this is tax on income, it's not something that you make based on luck alone.

&gt;Second of all, 75% for someone who barely scrapes by is different for 75% for someone who earns as much as he does. 

Sure, taxing a rich actor at 75% might be less wrong than to tax a poor fellow who works three jobs to keep his children in school and his family fed also at 75%, but it still is not right to tax the rich actor at 75%.

Sure, he might have more money than he needs to live and sure, there might be people out there on much much more difficult situations than the one he's in, but let's not go Robin Hood on the actor, he had to work for the money he had and it's certainly not his fault that there are others in society less fortunate than he is.

Sure, we live in society and it's expected for people who have more capacity to also pay more, after all, we all live within a state and nobody works for free, it has expenditures which have to be paid for by taxes, but to place such a disproportionate burden of these taxes on a few who happen to be wealthier, to accuse these and to be openly hostile to them if they get iffy in suddenly paying such a larger amount of tax when they'll personally not benefit one bit from the new situation, that's crazy.

While I personally find it difficult to imagine having his income, I certainly don't find it difficult to understand why he would want to move to Belgium when the French government is suddenly out there trying to punish the wealthy for being guilty of the crime of being wealthy.

So far he has paid his taxes, it's not like he's an asshole trying to get away with being a leech in the system. For us to attack him like he's being an evil bastard, I disagree with that, he's just being rational, anyone in his position would do the same, nobody gets rich by paying more than what he should.",0,1355690166,null,0,false,0,c7hkare,t3_14xvzf,t1_c7hkare,t1_c7hjf2g,null,1430690741,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;all of those countries even if don't have a legal minimum wage they instead nationwide collective bargaining agreements set minimum wages by job classification for each industry or just negotiated between unions and employer associations.

Which is precisely what we need here, instead of a system that sends people to unemployment if they happen to be below a certain threshold decided by the deputies, that value is decided on a case-to-case level, people entering the labour force can get a lower minimum wage and people who have a lot of experience can get an higher minimum wage.

&gt;So nop it's not your free market paradise as employers setting minimum wage as they please as you're saying.

Employers? There's no monopoly by the employers on the wage level, just like there's the employers who want to minimise their costs and pay less, there's the workforce who wants to maximise their benefits and receive more. On a free market, a company can't just say ""you're paid 1€ or you get nothing"" as then that worker can just find employment elsewhere and the initial company loses out on him.

On a free market, there's also no barriers to the entry in the market, even if there was only one company in the previous example and they only paid 1€/month, all it would need for it to be finished would be for someone to open a similar company and to instead pay 2€/month that all the labourers on the first company would go to work elsewhere and the first company would be out of business.

You fail to realise that in a free market, just like there's incentives for the prices to go down, there's also incentives for the wages to go up. Besides, if wages didn't go up, the companies wouldn't be able to sell so well their products in the first place as society wouldn't have the purchasing power required.

&gt;Lol all of those countries have some sort of public option of social security and healthcare so you're agreeing with me, having social safety nets increases social mobility :)

I'm not against a social security system, do pay attention that I'm not tugasnake x)

As for the social mobility, it's more complicated than that.

&gt; And companies will always want cheaper labor, they came to Portugal before because at the time we were cheaper, they went to eastern europe for same reason, more recently china, and i'm sure too.

Sure, some companies, yes. Others favour a more knowledgeable workforce. Just because the Danes and the Finnish are paid much more than the Ukrainians and the Chinese that doesn't mean the Danes and the Finnish are all unemployed. They just produce pharmaceuticals and cellphones instead of shoes and pens.

&gt;You can't compete with cheaper labor, because you will always loose to developing countries.

True that, but still, a different minimum wage doesn't mean we want to compete with the Chinese, it's simply giving people like the younger people out of college a chance at the labour market. If there's people who are willing to work under 470€ (like I would if I wasn't studying at the moment), why should it be illegal for me to do that here but fine if I went to Germany?

&gt;So i'm sorry companies won't come back to portugal because they can fire someone even easier, because they can have 5 chinese people or more doing the same job for the same wage.

Again, liberalising the labour market isn't trying to compete with the Chinese, it's simply to try and not distort the market. With that logic, we ought to have a minimum wage of 5000€, that would mean we'd all out-compete the Austrians and the Norwegians and the Japanese, though it doesn't work like that, as it's quite obvious, if we did that, we'd just have a 90% unemployment rate or 90% emigration rate.

&gt;engineers for example are being offered in average 500€, so how can you say if there was no minimum wage companies would pay more if they pay only as low as they legally can? 

If they're offered 500€ and they take it then it's because they accept it. It would be the same in Sweden.

&gt;And for the record the minimum unemployment payment is 419€ which is less than the minimum wage so no one can refuse a job ""because they make more being unemployed"" 

Yup, that skews things up and I personally know of people who refused to work part-time because they made more money being unemployed. That's not sustainable, though.

&gt;REN is a good example, how are you gonna privatize a company that is the holder of the country's two main energy infrastructure networks gas and electricity?

REN is a natural monopoly, that's not a free market if there's such a massive restriction for new competitors.

Though we could still make a lot of money out of it by privatising and taxing it a lot, but I don't know if we should do that. :P

&gt;And no i don't think essential infrastructure should be privatized because you as a citizen already paid for it's construction.

There's a lot that could be privatised that could benefit us all as it would lead to a great decrease in state expenditure and would be more efficiently run by the private sector. RTP and TAP were two prime-examples but there are several more, another two examples would be STCP and Metro do Porto.

&gt;Lol yes actually TAP provides a better service as Ryanair, anyone who's fought with both companies would tell you that.

At what cost? TAP costs millions of euros to the state while Ryanair costs nothing. You know those massive tax increases and the money that we're not spending on out healthcare, our education and our elderly? It's being spent on TAP whereas Ryanair does the exact same thing and costs 0€.

&gt;RTP is a diferent deal, because even if i don't agree with it's ""public service"" definition, i certainly don't agree with all the privatization models suggested so far.

What I don't agree with is the massive taxes that are driving businesses away from Portugal that lead to an increase in unemployment that lead to more young people leaving the country, all this because the state can't stop squandering money on useless shit like RTP, specially when we already have several privately-owned TV stations that can make a profit and not be yet another burden to the taxpayer.",0,1355692022,null,0,false,0,c7hku7l,t3_14tpki,t1_c7hku7l,t1_c7hjyuz,null,1430691009,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

If anything, that deficit was accumulated because the state mismanaged its funds and couldn't keep its spending in check. And they continue to do so, or at least that's what it seems, a 75% tax rate is insane, it would be much more reasonable if they instead tried to cut spending.

That it hasn't succeeded yet doesn't mean it can't succeed. The US military has basically lost three major wars in the last fifty years against peasants with simple weaponry. It could very well lose the next revolution.

&gt;It has protected murdering of innocent children. That was my point.

No, it protects individual gun ownership but doesn't grant any right to kill people. Also, in Norway Anders Brevik killed way more people than died in this massacre, yet there's no Second Amendment to blame it on. This may surprise you, but millions of gun owners go through life without massacring children.

true,mirered,null,null,"&gt; Which is precisely what we need here, instead of a system that sends people to unemployment if they happen to be below a certain threshold decided by the deputies, that value is decided on a case-to-case level, people entering the labour force can get a lower minimum wage and people who have a lot of experience can get an higher minimum wage.

See that's reasonable, i can agree with you that would be ideal, but how can you realistically implement this? 

&gt; You fail to realise that in a free market, just like there's incentives for the prices to go down, there's also incentives for the wages to go up. Besides, if wages didn't go up, the companies wouldn't be able to sell so well their products in the first place as society wouldn't have the purchasing power required.

 I realize this is the theory, but i'm not sure it will work so well in our context. I mean just look at how ERSE is managing the liberalization of the electricity sector. They are essentially forcing people to leave the regulated market by raising prices until they leave. That's not freedom that's blackmail. If it was truly free as it should, the lower prices and better offer of the liberalized market companies would suffice to incentive people to leave the regulated market.
So while on theory i could agree with some reforms to the labor laws, but not just making them more precarious, because i don't that's the solution, i'm mostly afraid of the implementation in Portugal. Because most of our adaptations of other countries suck. And of course the companies obviously take advantage of poor governing.

&gt; Again, liberalising the labour market isn't trying to compete with the Chinese, it's simply to try and not distort the market. With that logic, we ought to have a minimum wage of 5000€, that would mean we'd all out-compete the Austrians and the Norwegians and the Japanese, though it doesn't work like that, as it's quite obvious, if we did that, we'd just have a 90% unemployment rate or 90% emigration rate.

No, but the minimum wage should definitely be adjusted to the cost of living. There's a reason all the social partners including the companies confederation and and the confederation of commerce and industry are ok with the proposal to raise barely the minimum wage to 500€. Because they know their employees barely pay their bills right now. Why don't they just raise the wages without being the law like you propose? I dunno, maybe because they only want to pay what's the legally minimum and nothing else.

&gt; If they're offered 500€ and they take it then it's because they accept it. It would be the same in Sweden.

Nop because according to collective bargaining most have to be payed above above a certain rate, so it would be illegal for a company to hire someone violating the rates set by collective bargain.

&gt; Yup, that skews things up and I personally know of people who refused to work part-time because they made more money being unemployed. That's not sustainable, though.

Part time jobs are a completely thing. You don't have any of the protections for full-time job, and you can't really support yourself with a part-time job.

&gt; REN is a natural monopoly, that's not a free market if there's such a massive restriction for new competitors.
Though we could still make a lot of money out of it by privatising and taxing it a lot, but I don't know if we should do that. :P

Well i'm against this type of privatization because some private entity will just get a monopoly and guaranteed profits for pretty much forever and no risks. Yet it was sold and not for a large amount of money :\

&gt; At what cost? TAP costs millions of euros to the state while Ryanair costs nothing. You know those massive tax increases and the money that we're not spending on out healthcare, our education and our elderly? It's being spent on TAP whereas Ryanair does the exact same thing and costs 0€.

Portugal can't directly finance it's airline company because the EU finance rule prohibits the countries from doing that.  So no you're not giving money directly to TAP from your taxes now. And Ryanair services can't be compared to TAP, they are a low cost airline, so you have to pay for everything that they deem more than essential. And TAP is certifiable a great airline, how many awards did Ryanair won? What's the average review of a Ryanair passenger? And TAP isn't exactly a near bankrupt company, it has a big passive yes, but so do a lot of airlines. The value of the company is certainly more than the 20 millions it's gonna be sold. So if the Gov want to have a serious talk about selling TAP for it's true network value it needs to be a transparent process and again not run by Minister Relvas.

&gt; What I don't agree with is the massive taxes that are driving businesses away from Portugal that lead to an increase in unemployment that lead to more young people leaving the country, all this because the state can't stop squandering money on useless shit like RTP, specially when we already have several privately-owned TV stations that can make a profit and not be yet another burden to the taxpayer.

Again, all of the privatizations that are going on are gonna serve the tax payer better and that's the problem. I never said i agreed with the model of RTP has, i just said i don't agree what it is happening with the privatization process. Yes you pay a fee now for the ""public television"" but once the Angolans buy 49% of it and apparently become majority shareholders (who would think 49 would be the new 51?) you will still efectivly pay a fee for a state propaganda tv station owned by angolans.  So is this helpful? Again if the Gov would want to have a serious discussion about this they wouldn't made any of the bullshit that has been happening.",0,1355695840,null,0,false,0,c7hlxcm,t3_14tpki,t1_c7hlxcm,t1_c7hku7l,null,1430691507,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

No, the agenda is banning guns. The justifications change, the goal remains the same. And, as mentioned in my last post, Anders Brevik kind of destroys the notion that making them more restricted will reduce the size and frequency of such tragedies. 

&gt;The bottom line is: if these shooters could not get their hands on more damaging weapons, then the shootings would be fewer and less severe

The shooters performing these massacres aren't using exotic assault rifles that one would find in a video game. They're using small-caliber rifles and pistols. Going after the guns they use would effectively be outlawing guns since other guns are more powerful.

&gt;And as far as you having a basic right to an MP15, you've gotta sell me on it better than ""cuz it's a basic right."" 

In the US it is defined as a basic right. More accurately, it is defined as a matter in which the government is specifically prohibited from interfering. I could just as easily demand from you an argument detailing why the government has the ability to interfere with our lives when it comes to the possession of objects.

&gt;That's just not an intelligent argument. If you want to make the argument that you want to stock up these weapons to defend yourself against some tyrannical American government, fine, I guess then that's a valid response, but I personally think it's a bat shit crazy one.

The US government has started two wars of aggression in the recent past. It is recording every call, e-mail, and SMS of its citizens without warrant. It kidnaps foreign nationals and sends them lawless places, [occasionally sodomizing them](http://news.antiwar.com/2012/12/13/human-rights-court-cia-tortured-sodomized-german-citizen/). The President has begun a policy where he can kill anyone, including US citizens, on a whim without judicial oversight, a power he used on a sixteen year-old boy simply because he was born the son of someone declared a terrorist and killed by the president. Those drones operating overseas are now being used domestically, and the likelihood of Presidential hit lists being employed within US borders seems to be very high.

That's just not true.  You really think these people are so ingenuine as that their real goal is to keep YOU from having guns, not stopping atrocities?  Please, that is typical American politics (e.g. the bat shit crazy kind) to believe the other side has bad intentions instead of also trying to come to a good solution to national problems.


&gt; The justifications change, the goal remains the same. And, as mentioned in my last post, Anders Brevik kind of destroys the notion that making them more restricted will reduce the size and frequency of such tragedies.

That's one event, so, um, you can't talk about frequency.  The *average* impact, and the frequency of these events in Norway is less.  

&gt; The US government has started two wars of aggression in the recent past. It is recording every call, e-mail, and SMS of its citizens without warrant. It kidnaps foreign nationals and sends them lawless places, occasionally sodomizing them[1] . The President has begun a policy where he can kill anyone, including US citizens, on a whim without judicial oversight, a power he used on a sixteen year-old boy simply because he was born the son of someone declared a terrorist and killed by the president. Those drones operating overseas are now being used domestically, and the likelihood of Presidential hit lists being employed within US borders seems to be very high. I don't think there's any question that the US government is tyrannical.

Yes, and guns are legal, and it's not stopping the US government. You're all too busy watching Dancing with the Stars.

This is a culture issue folks. Whether you like it or not, making guns illegal today would do almost nothing to curb gun crime, and furthermore, it would give the thousands of criminals that have illegal guns a leg-up on citizens.

Personally, I hunt and own several rifles, but I think handguns should indeed be illegal, and I think anybody that owns a gun should have to go through extensive training to have a permit. I also think that carrying a gun around does indeed increase your chance of mortality if an incident arises. But the rhetoric on this thread is RIDICULOUS.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;See that's reasonable, i can agree with you that would be ideal, but how can you realistically implement this? 

Just like the Austrians and Germans and Danes and Swedes and Finns did, it's presented, discussed in parliament and approved. What could be so difficult about it?

&gt;I realize this is the theory, but i'm not sure it will work so well in our context. I mean just look at how ERSE is managing the liberalization of the electricity sector.

Again, the electricity sector is a natural monopoly. Unless it's a free market where there are several competitors and they have a equal chance and aren't working as a cartel, you can't discuss these issues.

&gt;So while on theory i could agree with some reforms to the labor laws, but not just making them more precarious, because i don't that's the solution, i'm mostly afraid of the implementation in Portugal. Because most of our adaptations of other countries suck. And of course the companies obviously take advantage of poor governing.

You're comparing the electricity market where there's one supplier and a lot of consumers to the labour market where there's a lot of suppliers and a lot of consumers. It would work here just as fine as it did in the countries previously mentioned, there's no incentives for it to go work, both the employers and the employees would benefit for a less restricted market and the labour unions could actually start doing something useful for a change.

&gt;No, but the minimum wage should definitely be adjusted to the cost of living. There's a reason all the social partners including the companies confederation and and the confederation of commerce and industry are ok with the proposal to raise barely the minimum wage to 500€. Because they know their employees barely pay their bills right now.

There's more to it. The labour unions want it because it does protect those who are already employed (the people who they're there to protect), the social partners are fine with it because it shows they're not evil and that they want us to succeed and are willing to give something up (and it's isn't that big of an issue, it's only a small increase) and the companies also aren't making much of an issue because they already have people they hired whose wages make up for the minimum wage and because if the minimum wage was lowered instead of raised then they could possibly lose if some other company hired these new workers under the current threshold while the companies which already wired the workers would either be stuck with the workers they have now or have to pay fees if they decided to fire them.

The ones who'll lose the most if this goes forward are not represented, it's the workers (like me if I wasn't studying) whose qualifications aren't enough to make up for a 500€ wage.

I agree with you, the minimum wage needs to be adjusted to the cost of living, but not like this, it should be on a case to case level like in Austria, because it's actually silly that a 21 living alone on a rented house to have the same minimum wage than a guy in his 30s with an unemployed wife and 2 kids, and our systems completely neglects the situation of the individuals it tries to protect.

&gt;So no you're not giving money directly to TAP from your taxes now. And Ryanair services can't be compared to TAP, they are a low cost airline, so you have to pay for everything that they deem more than essential. And TAP is certifiable a great airline, how many awards did Ryanair won? What's the average review of a Ryanair passenger? And TAP isn't exactly a near bankrupt company, it has a big passive yes, but so do a lot of airlines. The value of the company is certainly more than the 20 millions it's gonna be sold.

One thing is certain, TAP workers are public workers paid by our taxes while Ryanair is completely independent. These both offer the same services and Ryanair isn't a burden for the state and actually flies more people.

If Ryanair charges for a drink on board and only flies if the flight is full while TAP offers everyone a meal and doesn't bother flying a plane with only a dozen passengers, that's besides the point - it's not the role of the state to have an airline, specially one which is so inefficient and is costing us all more money than the benefit it's giving us.

About its privatisation, I don't know about it, I also don't trust Relvas but between him selling it or TAP continuing to add to our debt, I much rather have TAP being managed by the Chinese or Argentinians or whatever and not be taxed as much. So if the Gov want to have a serious talk about selling TAP for it's true network value it needs to be a transparent process and again not run by Minister Relvas.

&gt;Again, all of the privatizations that are going on are gonna serve the tax payer better and that's the problem. I never said i agreed with the model of RTP has, i just said i don't agree what it is happening with the privatization process. Yes you pay a fee now for the ""public television"" but once the Angolans buy 49% of it and apparently become majority shareholders (who would think 49 would be the new 51?) you will still efectivly pay a fee for a state propaganda tv station owned by angolans. So is this helpful? Again if the Gov would want to have a serious discussion about this they wouldn't made any of the bullshit that has been happening.

You're right. If it was me, I'd sell 100% of it, the state doesn't need the expense and certainly needs the money it would make by selling it.

I don't even watch RTP, the only Portuguese TV I watch is almost only SIC Notícias and SIC Radical, so it's not like I'd even bother at all if the new owners decided to change the channel drastically.",0,1355698937,null,0,false,0,c7hmrn5,t3_14tpki,t1_c7hmrn5,t1_c7hlxcm,null,1430691904,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;You really think these people are so ingenuine as that their real goal is to keep YOU from having guns, not stopping atrocities?

Yes, mostly because eliminating private gun ownership doesn't stop atrocities. If they were genuinely concerned about the problem they would address it rather than addressing a mostly tangential issue.

What? What would be painful would be to inflate our wealth away and fail to fix the underlining problem which is the constant excessive deficits.

&gt;while Germany doesn't help Portugal.

You've got to be kidding me, they have already sent millions and millions through cohesion and development EU funds. What, you think it should be Germany the one to pay for all of Portugal's mistakes and mismanagements?

&gt;That's why the ECB left euro interest rates unchanged at its last meeting.

ECB =/= Germany

&gt;That just isn't fair.

It also wouldn't be fair for the rest of Europe if we paid less than that which we agreed to.

&gt;A judicious management of demand, like indeed the &gt;3% German fiscal deficits earlier in the cycle has it's part to play.

If we agreed to a 3% deficit through the euro convergence agreement, we can't complain about it now. If anything, it should have been more strictly enforced in the past - if it were, we wouldn't be in the mess now.

&gt;No one is suggesting some absurd Weimar printing.

You're the one who wants to print money, as if inflation shouldn't be kept in check at 2% or 3%.

&gt;But a reasonable sensitivity to the travails of Southern Europe could be expected of Germany in view of how Southern Europe's demand helped Germany earlier in the cycle. 

It isn't about helping in cycles, it's about all of us working together. We can't fuck up out fiscal budgets for years and demand the Germans to pay for this.

&gt;I just cannot abide people who think the Germans are gonna do them a favour when the Germans are just gonna stiff 'em.

true,dageshi,null,null,"Making this EU super state is going to take many years. What's happening to the southern states and the recession that's spreading through the eurozone is part of it. All these countries must synchronise their economies together in order to make them viable within a single currency and ultimately a single nation, this isn't going to happen quickly, it'll still be going through the same problems in a years time and a year after that. If you're in the eurozone then ultimately you must believe this is worth the price, ""to punch above your weight"".

But this process for the UK causes us to rebalance economically away from the eurozone (and so the bigger part of the EU), if countries are in recession there is no growth in these markets so we can't export to them, we must export elsewhere, gradually as Mr Farage pointed out our net trade with the rest of the EU will diminish.

So we start to think what's the point in being in it exactly? Twenty or thirty years ago perhaps it made a lot of sense because trade barriers were much higher, but with globalisation nowadays trade barriers are much lower all over the world. If the EU is going to be busy building a super state for many years is it really best to stick around holding things up? Because we're not going to join but every year there will be a new treaty which we will have to argue about because we won't want it to apply to us?

I no longer think so. And I don't think it's good for the EU to become this big homogonised lump it's becoming. Same currency, same fiscal policy (coming soon), same laws, probably soon same taxes, same VAT rate.

C'est le prix a payer pour aller de l'avant et progresser en tant qu'espèces. 

On ne peux pas en vouloir à Marie Curie, Einstein ou Rockfeller pour ces morts. Car le seul moyen d'éviter tout risque serait d'absolument rien entreprendre et de rester à vivre comme des primates dans la savane. Sans moi. La civilisation c'est aller de l'avant, prendre des risques oui, pas faire du sur place et passer son temps à se préoccuper de ceux qui restent derrière mais aider ceux qui veulent et peuvent aller de l'avant. Aujourd'hui en France on met des battons dans les roues de ceux qui prennent les risques pour aller de l'avant et on leur crache dessus quand ils se plaignent qu'on veule prendre le fruit de leurs risques et labeurs.

Quelques citations du grand Thomas Sowell pour méditer sur tout ça:

&gt; I have never understood why it is ""greed"" to want to keep the money you have earned but not greed to want to take somebody else's money.

&gt; If you have been voting for politicians who promise to give you goodies at someone else’s expense, then you have no right to complain when they take your money and give it to someone else, including themselves.

&gt; Socialism in general has a record of failure so blatant that only an intellectual could ignore or evade it.

Second mandatory helmet laws tend to reduce bicycle use (shown in NSW Australia for example in the 90s), thus making cycling more dangerous per the previous point. 

In other words, there isn't necessarily a negative causality between helmet use and safety; rather, mandatory helmet laws are a common cause for both helmet user as a % of riders going up and safety going down.

About your second point, it could be argued that this point of view is the same for both sides. Both Armenians and Azeris are guilty of ethnic cleansing (or at least ethnic expulsions), both governments claim Karabakh is their own and advance their legal/historical/moral/... justification to that end, both parties use anti-other propaganda to cement their claim.

But in the long run, both parties risk never being able to make peace. As of now, the population on both sides are taught completely different histories and interpretations of the conflict, emphasizing that everything is the fault of the other, who is the real bad guy. But, if there is to be a real lasting peace, it needs to be approved by the Armenian population and the Azeri population as a whole, not just by their respective governments.

In both cases a large and prosperous middle class was formed in the new democracy. In Spain's case much of the Post Franco model of a property owning constitutional monarchy was clearly based on the UK.
Right down to the example (unlike the US) of making mortgage debt follow the lender not end cleanly as one hands in the keys. In the last ten years too both countries went through a housing boom and brought in vast number of immigrants. 6 million onto a population of 40 million in the case of Spain. The saving grace ( if that is what is was...) of the UK is that little new housing was built.

true,llehsadam,EURO,"Berlin, from Poland","I disagree, I think you should read The Moral Landscape by Sam Harris. It explains how different cultures with different moralities can coexists, and how some plainly can't. But this doesn't have much to do with my argument, it's just something you should read (or reread to understand fully).

Most with your assumption that cultures have to be competitive. You do not support your claim that this is *by nature*. Your examples are more of religion than of culture and I think there should be a distinction between the two. I give myself as an example. Culturally I am Polish, but *I am an atheist*. I don't feel superior to anyone, well... maybe Germans. But who doesn't, right?

Anyway... I *strongly* believe that something more important for culture than religion, ethics, or morals is tradition. If you believe sustained tradition to be the central pillar of culture, then the idea of multiculturalism becomes much easier to handle.

Culture has nothing to do with feeling superior, this is baggage that comes *de facto* from being born into an ignorant inheritance. It is *the job of multiculturalism* to show these children why their culture is special and fits into a diverse European family of cultures, but at the same time *is not the only viable culture out there.*

Lets not fool ourselves, some cultures are not viable. But these are extremes that die out when released from poverty through education and the empowerment of women. If these cultures exist in Europe, then that means our social welfare system does not serve to promote self-independence, our educational system does not empower women like it should, and our governments ignore their citizenry. **By all means, the existence of human-rights-disrespecting culture in our midst points to our own failures as a secular culture.** Something the American model got right was that in order for immigrants to be successful, they had to learn the language, work hard and merge their own traditions with American ethics. If only Europe had an effective socialist method of doing this, we would not be having the outbreaks of extreme religion among immigrants in Europe.

Multiethnicism is something that exists because race exists. It comes into being due to other factors and shouldn't be striven for in itself because that way of thinking could be considered racism. A proposal for mulitethnicism without multiculturalism is alarming. It's literally asking for race without the baggage, which to me sounds like an intolerant's guise for racism. Multiethnism comes from different cultures coming to one place (these cultures will likely be of different races), bringing with them their cooking, tradition, and other cultural values. Stating that these are not welcome, i.e that these beliefs are not as good as the ones you have, is intolerant and in this case, racist. It's exactly like a situation that forces an individual to state ""I ain't racialist, look at all me black Asian friends"" when stating this alone does not prove anything.  

You have to accept the traditions and some of the views of other cultures to not be a racist bigot. Of course there are cultures with major flaws, but if a culture is to work in our society, European ethics need to be as strong as American ethics in forcing that culture to iron out these flaws for a well-pressed suit.

EDIT: To get an idea as to how America became the success it is, talk to an American that remembers some of these discussions from high school. EatingCake makes some good points.",0,1355743585,null,0,1355746302,0,c7hwrpk,t3_14uy0j,t1_c7hwrpk,t3_14uy0j,null,1430696688,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I came to this subreddit for content belonging to the latter, but it's becoming increasingly obvious that a large group rather want to discuss eating habits, roma populations and share pictures of Europe seen from the ISS.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, and it actually fits the description of the subreddit. But the more high brow stuff which dominated earlier is being buried by these other types of submissions. 

Since I believe I'm not the only one preferring subreddits with r/asksocialscience or r/askhistorians and not r/funny or r/DAE-content, there might actually be an audience for an old fashioned boring subreddit discussing European politics.

true,llehsadam,EURO,"Berlin, from Poland","Great examples, but also the American model i.e. the melting-pot promotes multiculturalism in a way Europe should strive for. In America, tradition is absorbed into the conglomeration because the basic American ethics of hard work and tolerance are very general and easy for immigrants to fit into. It also helps that in order to succeed, immigrants have to learn to appreciate differences and develop a tolerance for cultural-mix. Also, the shared feeling of opportunity among all immigrants gives a common topic for conversation. Be it from the first time you substitute traditional foods with American products, or when you visit your work friends and eat foods you never tasted before. I speak from experience, my family moved to the US when I was 5 and I got to live the process that Europe lacks. I lived in Queens for the first year, and yeah, it's multicultural. We probably added to it when we invited our neighbors for dinner, or when we talked to other immigrants at my school. (I'm back in Europe now, because America is not perfect... especially when it comes to university costs which are a big thing for me right now).

And the most amazing thing about the States is that multiculturalism sticks long after the second/third generation forgets the language. Americans never forget where they came from and cherish their own cultural distinctions because that's what makes American diversity function and that's what America is proud of.

Europe... lacks that and needs to come up with a solution that fits Europe. It's a daunting task and I'm not surprised we are having difficulties. 

A lot of Europeans probably won't agree, but I think the solution should not be looked for in short term changes. Here are my thoughts...

 I think reforming education^1 and creating a social net^2 that forces the jobless to seek jobs or relearn for a new one. Also, Europe needs to embrace some solid ethics that everyone takes to heart. This can't be done overnight be government (well propaganda helps a bit), it'll have to be a cultural change coming from the people. Right now, through crisis, we have an opportunity to change the European mindset. Something wonderful that is emerging out of this is the principle of being green, but we also need something that immigrants could attach themselves to, e.g. opportunity, egalitarianism, secularism, fraternization.

These are probably not the answers we are looking for, but **something has to be done in Europe to establish an identity immigrants can relate to**... because if we don't we will become bigoted with perceptions about the world that don't necessarily reflect reality.

1. In my opinion, in a way that promotes competition among students but still gives a minimum education to those that don't wish to compete, except if it is the parents that are the problem (schools should have a solid counseling department for students that works in spite of bad parenting).  Bad parenting is the biggest problem our education system is facing, so a work-around would be good.

2. This social net has to also help families. Women need a place they can anonymously go to seek counseling from peers who were in similar situations. For example, a woman with an abusive husband should have a place she can go to without anyone's knowledge where a woman of similar cultural backgrounds can offer her help.",0,1355745993,null,0,false,0,c7hx0jf,t3_14uy0j,t1_c7hx0jf,t1_c7h0v54,null,1430696804,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

La politica italiana oggi è in uno stato di confusione totale. Questo avviene per due fattori. Primo: sta venendo meno lo schema che ha tenuto insieme la baracca negli ultimi vent'anni, ovvero Berlusconi di qua e tutti gli altri di là. Secondo: il governo tecnico ha avuto, politicamente, l'effetto di azzerare quel poco di bipolarismo che si era innestato a forza dopo la fine della prima repubblica. Gli effetti di questa confusione impattano sui partiti in modo diverso.

* Pdl - Confusione massima, dovuta in gran parte al fatto che Berlusconi è al minimo storico di lucidità. Negli ultimi sei mesi l'uomo ha sbagliato tutto quello che poteva sbagliare, ritrovandosi adesso costretto a fare campagna elettorale contro Monti e a dovere offrire alla Lega qualsiasi cosa chieda per tenere insieme l'alleanza e provare a rendere ingovernabile il Senato (dove la legge elettorale prevede un complicatissimo meccanismo di attribuzione seggi su scala regionale) con l'obiettivo di costringere chiunque vinca a venire a bussare da lui. Altro problema: sotto di lui (e della sua ridotta di fedelissimi), il partito è oltre l'implosione. Buona parte di quelli di An escono oggi: faranno una lista ""di destra"" (qualunque cosa questo voglia dire) da federarsi col Pdl e poi si vedrà. I montiani (ovvero quelli che cercano una sopravvivenza oltre Berlusconi) sono quelli messi peggio di tutti: avevano scommesso tutto su Alfano per uscire dall'orbita di Berlusconi e agganciarsi al centro, solo che Alfano - dimostrando di avere enormi limiti politici - non è riuscito a reggere l'urto dell'operazione e li ha lasciati con una mano davanti e una di dietro. Per loro rimarrebbe l'ipotesi di scissione, ma la portata della cosa sarebbe talmente ridotta da metterli in condizione di trattare col centro in posizione di assoluta debolezza, e questo a non tutti conviene.

* Lega - Confusione alta. L'uscita di scena di Bossi è ancora lungi dall'essere metabolizzata. Il problema è che l'elettorato è arcistufo di Berlusconi e del Pdl, ma senza un'alleanza solida l'irrilevanza è sicura. La trattativa in corso sulla Lombardia (che la Lega si vorrebbe prendere per fare il filotto con Piemonte e Veneto) serve ad intavolare quella sul piano nazionale. L'obiettivo è di allearsi con Berlusconi senza darlo troppo a vedere, ma non è facile

* Pd - Confusione media, ma in compenso molta incazzatura. Già aver dovuto rinunciare a stravincere le elezioni un anno fa per fare contento Napolitano e piazzare Monti a Palazzo Chigi gli ha fatto girare le palle in una maniera bestiale. Adesso che si sono resi conto che la promessa di neutralità di Monti in cambio della quale gli avevano dato il via libera era una solenne presa in giro, sono fuori dalla grazia di Dio. Nel giro di due settimane sono passati dalla vittoria sicura alla prospettiva di dover fare campagna elettorale contro Monti (il che implica un forte spostamento a sinistra con tutte le conseguenze del caso). La prospettiva di vincere male e di dovere negoziare con Monti (bene che vada mandarlo al Quirinale, male che vada farlo governare o da Palazzo Chigi o dal ministero dell'Economia) li terrorizza. Di positivo c'è che i problemi interni sono stati temporaneamente sistemati con le primarie (che peraltro hanno dato una grandissima mano quanto a immagine): per adesso si darà un qualche spazio alla corrente di Renzi, e poi al congresso si vedrà.

* Centro - Confusione totale. Il balletto di Monti che forse si candida o forse no o forse gli dà il nome in franchising o forse nemmeno quello li sta facendo diventare matti. Il punto è che, senza il faccione di Monti variamente spendibile nel simbolo elettorale, le ambizioni di questa gente sono drasticamente sovradimensionate rispetto all'effettivo quantitativo di voti a disposizione. L'idea che hanno (scommettere sul fatto che chiunque vinca lo faccia non bene e debba comunque venire a patti con loro) non cambia: solo, un conto è fare questi ragionamenti col 10% e un conto è farli col 20%. 

* Beppe Grillo - Confusione oltre l'assoluto. Il consenso è alto perché la logica del partito protestatario contro la casta, le banche e il padronato funziona sempre. Il problema è che la cosa gli sta scoppiando in mano. Complici l'esposizione mediatica e una struttura drammaticamente inadeguata, il partitello di Grillo sta perdendo quell'aura positiva che aveva fino a un mesetto fa. Al suo posto, si fa strada l'immagine del partito-setta gestito da due dittatori pazzi che decidono in solitudine orientando una massa di fanatici e cacciando gli altri. Il punto è che in Parlamento arriveranno dozzine e dozzine di grillini, nessuno dei quali ha idea di come funzioni la politica, e sarà un bel casino.",0,1355747055,null,0,false,0,c7hx4hm,t3_14yptw,t1_c7hx4hm,t3_14yptw,null,1430696856,27,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,27

The civilized, militarized west, including the US and Germany. 

&gt;  I doubt Germany even has the military capability to get down there on its own.

I doubt you have a good grasp about German military ability. We don't advertise it, though, so I don't really blame you.

&gt; For instance despite the fact that I'd love to invade NK and completely renew that country, we can't, because Seoul would be levelled in the process.

So? In war, people die. As we have painfully learned when *someone* decided it was a wonderful idea to targed civilian populations (yes, I am aware we were not exactly better, either).

&gt; Another example, Syria, is very complicated, because the Russians and Chinese oppose it to a decent extent, and knowing how much of an extent is hard.

Thus, geopolitically inconvinient. And really, I don't see how supporting the Syrian insurgents is a good thing considering Assad was a rather liberal dictator and one thing the Arab Spring has taught us is that now ""freed countries"" become more radically religious and more a quagmire with human right violations left and right.

&gt; Oh right, so let the genocides carry on and just ignore them yeah?

Yes, exactly that. Not because I like genocide, but because it is hypocritical to just support the extermination of genocide when it suits our policy. We got enough problems to fix already on our immediate neighborhood, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan/Pakistan or North Korea are none of our business and we should stay the fuck out of there.

&gt; I would say that's very German of you except the majority of Germans seem to be opposed to genocide these days.

False equalisation. Not wanting to military intervene != supporting genocide. Most Germans like that our military stays at home for the most part.

Pretty much all major capabilities of militaries are well known and published. Germany maintains a medium sized standing army with poor heavy lift capabilities and very little sea based power projection capability.

&gt;So? In war, people die.

So it's not really our call to make to invade NK when it'll involve a large percentage of SK'rs dying. It's abhorrent, and if there were a solution which didn't involve half of the population centres of SK being flattened then I'd take it in a heartbeat, but as it is, pragmatism wins out for the day.

&gt;Thus, geopolitically inconvinient.

If you like, I take that as realistic, if you want to call it that then geopolitically inconvenient seems a legitimate reason to me.

&gt;And really, I don't see how supporting the Syrian insurgents is a good thing considering Assad was a rather liberal dictator

That last word there, y'know, the ""dictator"" one, that's a good reason right on its own.

&gt;one thing the Arab Spring has taught us is that now ""freed countries"" become more radically religious

And unemployment went way up in post apartheid South Africa, I suppose you'd advocate putting the whites back in charge there eh?

&gt;it is hypocritical to just support the extermination of genocide when it suits our policy. 

We don't only oppose genocide when it's convenient, we just only *do* something when we're able to, which isn't hypocritical, it's just not suicidal. I've met many who think like you before, who seem to think that if we don't invade *every* country which does something bad then it's hypocritical to use military action upon any, as if we can't take the view that we will aim to achieve what is possible but not destroy ourselves trying to do everything.

&gt;North Korea

North Korea have concentration camps. And you think we should ignore that? My goodness.

I am genuinely quite shocked, and am not sure whether it's that you've received a terrible education, or maybe you're just really a monster.

&gt; Not wanting to military intervene != supporting genocide. 

Well it doesn't look like KJU is just going to decide to abolish his concentration camps for shits and giggles, so yes, it probably does require military intervention to stop that.

Berlin is also an excellent destination. 
Safety won't be an issue if you exercise normal caution, the one you'd use in Rome, for example.

A final advice regarding our national obsession: food. After countless Big Macs and flaccid train station sandwiches, you'll be tempted to get into one of the many Italian restaurants that entice you with their familiar sounding names and menus. Don't do it. Those restaurants are not for you, they are for the locals and they have adapted to local tastes. They are also overpriced by our standards. Instead head to a local eatery, it may be traditional or ethnic, not be afraid of experimenting. I had a wonderful Indonesian dinner in Amsterdam, reindeer soup in Norway, Eppelwein and bratwurst in Frankfurt and... something of undefined texture in London. However, they were all more memorable than the overcooked pasta bolognese you'd be served in an Italian restaurant abroad.

I think the Germans should have used quantitative easing as the Americans did to ease the severity of the crisis so that the South could carry out the structural reforms needed.

Inflation has not gone haywire in the US as the Germans said it would in 2008 and still say now.

US inflation is currently less than the eurozone's.

The ECB should lower euro interest rates so the euro can reconnect with its pre-crisis price relationship with the dollar to increase overseas demand for Southern Europe product.

Again to give the south the opportunity to carry out the reform needed.

As it is, the German inspired toxic austerity is killing GDP faster than it is reducing debt, locking the South in a death spiral, killing the european dream, and visiting totally unnecessary German manufactured misery on millions.

That's because we do not plan to engage in military adventures. Especially the rest of Europe should be quite content with that, given our history. 

&gt; So it's not really our call to make to invade NK when it'll involve a large percentage of SK'rs dying.

Saddam having and *using* Scud missiles against Tel Aviv did not prevent the US or the UK from getting into Iraq in '91. ""Protecting third-party populations"" is obviously not a priority.

&gt; That last word there, y'know, the ""dictator"" one, that's a good reason right on its own.

I'd take a liberal dictatorship against a pseudo-democratic sharia rule anytime.

&gt; North Korea have concentration camps. And you think we should ignore that? My goodness.

So does the United States. Now, why are we not attacking or at least embargoing the Americans? Because we live well knowing that.

We also live well knowing about NK concentration camps. We have known about them since the early 1970s, potentially earlier. We did nothing about them in the last fifty years, and now we are getting comfortable with them for the next half century. 

&gt; Nice dose of cowardice that is.

Sometimes, not engaging in military action is the right thing to do. For reference, see the [Convention of Tauroggen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_of_Tauroggen), which was almost exactly 200 years ago, as an example about how we think doing vasal service for other military powers.

I worked in English &amp; lived with people who spoke english, and did one lesson a week for about 9 months. After that the association shut down, and the only other lessons available were during work time, so I couldn't go. It was incredibly difficult. Immersion and making a real effort to talk french is one thing, but you also have to find french people who make the effort to talk back to you. when you can't say more than &lt;salut, ca va? oui, ca va&gt; the conversation isn't very interesting for anyone...

I progressed a bit because I have an english friend who speaks excellent french - I spent a lot of time in the bar listening to her talk to people, and occasionally asking for a translation or joining in a little. Eventually I met a nice french guy and after 9 months with him I'm quite comfortable talking in french, altho I still get stuck for vocab &amp; my grammar &amp; use of different tenses is very limited.

Since I lost my job &amp; have time I'm doing lessons &amp; am considering having a go at a DELF B1/B2 (the level below what you need for university) next year, but I need to learn more grammar &amp; get my writing up to standard. I honestly wouldn't dream of attempting university in French. A day of general conversation leaves me knackered, a day of lectures would do my head in entirely. But if you want to go in at the deep end, you will certainly be exposed to an enormous amount of French that way.

TL;DR immersion is bloody hard work for you &amp; for the french around you. You need the basics to even start. Maybe come as an english teacher, start with a week or 2 of intensive lessons, and see how you go :) Consider applying for university after 6 months or a year if you like it here.",0,1355753759,null,0,1355753949,0,c7hxzxo,t3_14yrh3,t1_c7hxzxo,t3_14yrh3,null,1430697268,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

31/10 vs. a target of 1,300) will be very hard to reach in the last two months of 2012. Regarding audits of VAT non-filers, the end-of-year benchmark in terms of number of audits has already been met (18,071 audits by the end of 2012 against a target of 10,000). The collection rate to date this year (20.83% of tax and penalty assessed) is in line with the 2012 target of 20%.
