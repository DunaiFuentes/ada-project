Look at what happens within countries themselves:

- they fight people from different religions (doesn't have to be islam vs christianity.. when they're done with that, it's protestant vs catholic, catholic vs orthodox... and the list goes on)
- they will fight over football teams
- political parties
- region vs region (dodgy southerners vs retarded northeners)
- city vs city
- town vs town
- village vs village

All of this is fueled by exactly the same thing, and it applies to country vs country, continent vs continent etc etc..

So yeah.. the only way we will stop 'fighting' between us and consider ourselves european (and btw, this ALREADY happens) is when we start comparing ourselves to other continents/federations etc (such as the USA, China and all that). You'd be surprised how many brits will identify as europeans in an argument/discussion with an american (and then it becomes ""us europeans, you americans"" and all that.

The other thing is... we are called europeans by people who are not in europe as we do generally have a lot of common things between us that we don't really see ourselves as we're too busy focusing on our differences... Censoring boobs? Un-european... Privacy abuse? Un-european.. Death penalty? Un-european.. etc etc..

I don't think anyone really needs any proof of this happening, we all know that as soon as we start having a little fight with americans, we all suddenly work as a team of 'europeans' to tell them how much more awesome we are than them (and vice versa of course).. just as we do with every other thing -- because we are humans and we are flawed in this way...

So.. british citizens being extradited to the US over trivial non-illegal things under british and european laws... the british government wanting to track everything their people do online (more than likely as part of some american thing to do with ""intellectual property"")... eventually the EU is going to speak up and a lot of anti-EU brits are gonna be like ""the EU is crap.. but okay, I agree with them right now.. damn americans thinking they can do what they want in europe!!"".. simply because their survival instincts activate and they realize that the the USA actually is much more powerful than them and the only way to get them to stop bullying is as a collective... but until then?? Pffft.. my country is the strongest and most important country in the world!! :)

So yeah.. basically that's all it takes for each individual EU country's citizens to suddenly feel european.. get pwned by someone much bigger than them... until then, that country's citizens will always think they are superior, who belong to the superior region of that country, in the most superior city etc etc etc..

In fact.. if the americans were not too busy crapping themselves about external threats (""everyone is out to get us because of our freedom or [insert any other propaganda here]""), they too would start falling out with each other, because just like in the EU.. some states are leeches and others are contributors (for example, Texas keeps threatening to secceed from the USA if they don't get their own way, but it's mostly a bluff.. basically Texas is the UK).

So... if your wish is for human beings to stop trying to screw each other over and for complete peace to exist... we need to find another race in our galaxy to fight with.. and then become friends with them when some other races from another galaxy start pwning us... until then, we're gonna keep expanding our groups by what makes us similar and fight with the other groups (or keep peace by all groups knowing that everyone would lose if they duked it out.. kinda like US vs Russia)",0,1334250129,null,0,true,0,c4bgc4o,t3_s5z9h,t1_c4bgc4o,t3_s5z9h,null,1435721638,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

true,Jonisaurus,EURO,European Union,"I am not talking about a general Pirate Party phenomenon, but looking at the German version alone: many pride themselves with admitting to not being knowledgeable about all topics and then condemning other politicians for being liars which is an incredibly stupid statement to make. This is where we come back to black and white, good and evil. Only simple minds divide into those two categories.

Now coming back to my own personal opinion (the above was merely a fair observation), I don't think their idea of liquid democracy is good. I'm not at all a support of direct democracy, and I don't think we need more of it. I may lay trust in the general public to judge a person's character or general political directions (like the balance between small government and social systems etc.), but I absolutely do not trust the general public in making good judgements in single issues.

To give some examples: the American public largely thinks Reagan's economic policies were good for their economy, they think Reagan won the Cold War. The British public vilifies the European Union as something that it clearly isn't (incited by their media) and the German public condemns nuclear energy almost religiously. No, I do not trust the general public to make good decisions.

Ohai, direct democracy has nothing to do with immigration.

&gt; But in a direct democracy you do not vote for representative, you vote for issues that representatives would be there to solve.

I think we have to clear something up.  I regret if there is a misunderstanding.

Switzerland, except in certain local elections, is not a full ""direct democracy"".  It's usually referred to as a direct democracy because it is by very very very far the country in Europe which empowers individual citizens the most vis-à-vis their government.

I assume that by ""direct democracy"" we mean ""partial direct democracy"".  Switzerland elects representatives at local, cantonal, and federal level, but it also gives each citizen the possibility of (comparatively easily) triggering a vote on any issue of concern, at all levels, and frequently results in decisions made by politicians and/or bureaucrats being overturned.  And of course you also have a constitution which lays out fundamental limits.

Of course full and total ""direct democracy"" is not possible as soon as you have more than a few thousand people.  I regret if there is any confusion.  Before I go on, I invite you to tell me if your other points still hold given the above, and I'll gladly reply.

Das meiner Meinung nach einzige nennenswerte Gegenargument ist die mögliche Behinderung von Kindern, die aus sochen Beziehungen entstehen. Allerdings ist es ja, wie von der Autorin erwähnt, auch behinderten Personen erlaubt Kinder zu bekommen die mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit auch behindert sein werden. Ich persönlich denke zwar, dass es in solchen Situationen insbesondere bei schweren Behinderungen, die vererbt werden, ein Verbot vom *Kinderkriegen* geben sollte. Das lässt sich aber auch mit Verhütungsmitteln so bewerkstelligen, dass die Partner immer noch Geschlechtsverkehr haben können. Außerdem widerpricht ein solches Verbot den Menschenrechten, da ja jeder selbst entscheiden darf, ob er Kinder haben will oder nicht, und sich dies nicht durch eugenische Maßnahmen des Staates bestimmen lassen muss.

true,[deleted],null,null,"All right I'll rebut your earlier reply then, given that we're talking about limited direct democracy (i.e. ""the Swiss model"").

Switzerland has always had a high immigrant population (the numbers tend to be around 20%-25% foreign-born - the country has always been well able to handle integration of second and third generation persons of foreign origin), due to its importation first of low-skilled labor, then of successive waves of refugees, and finally after the flood of highly-educated foreigners following the massive relocations of corporate headquarters to the country.

The main effect has been a downward pressure on salaries, and an upward pressure on housing.  Although it means Swiss consumers can't go on so many cheap holidays abroad anymore, it's also had the effect of forcing retail prices to more sensible levels, and stimulating the construction industry - not to mention making Switzerland _much_ more competitive as an exporting nation.

I won't address your paper, as it concerns a very very specific aspect of Swiss democracy - namely decisions on naturalization of immigrants.  This is no longer the case almost anywhere, beyond a very few small communities.  It has absolutely no bearing on the larger issue of immigration to the country, which has had net positive effects.

&gt; One of the greatest examples of why Europe should become a federation is Switzerland.

Switzerland is not a federation.  Switzerland is a confederation with federal elements.   Confoederatio Helvetica.  The example is totally inapplicable to Europe, because Switzerland, despite a linguistic diversity, has cultural commonalities combined with a small size that make it feasible to maintain a good balance between federalism and regionalism / local rights.  This would _never_ work in Europe as a whole with the same structures.  It is too big and too diverse.  

The rights of individuals, which have been cherished in Switzerland, both in myth and in fact (in the latter basically in the form of local yokels with sticks who occasionally burned down whatever aristocrat's house who was getting too uppity) are deeply rooted in the national conscience.  This assures that a centralized bureaucracy will have a lot of trouble taking them away - something you cannot say about Spain, France, the Netherlands, Lithuania, the Nordics, Greece, you name it.

Back to your original point,

&gt; a Switzerland united by alliances and trade agreements went through a period of foreign invasions and civil war and came out as a federal republic. The reason as to why the French Invasion was rather peaceful was because of disfunctionality.

You will also note that the French invasion was a positive experience for the country, as it overthrew the oligarchic old order and introduced concepts of constitutional rights that culminated in the 1848 constitution.  

A war of conquest nowadays is so far-fetched, due to the sheer unprofitability of it, that...no.  Just no.

&gt; And see the goal is not to make your life easier, it's for you to make the loves of other's easier. This isn't the same thing because you don't have incentive to help others if you have a direct democracy. 

First off, the goal is to make everyone's life easier.  You can't just break it down into ""I vote in pure rational self-interest"" like some sort of nonsense Ayn Rand mishmash, or ""representative democracy yields altruism"".  And forgive me, but the second part of your statement is just nonsensical.  For me it is typical of the distrust of voters harbored by many Europeans fearful of some sort of populist armageddon.  Voters are not stupid, voters are not base egotistical beasts.  Look at the last 10 national referenda in Switzerland - in most cases, the ""sensible"" option prevailed (a recent case in point being the ill-conceived attempt to raise the mandatory base holidays to 6 weeks/year, recognized easily as unaffordable and unsustainable).    

&gt; ""Politics is the continuation of war by other means"" and if it is the populace that acts as politician, instead of politics, you'll have civil strife.

Es genügt ein Gentest der potentiellen Eltern, ob tatsächlich ein erhöhtes Risiko für Behinderung der Kinder besteht. Das ist ja auch bei Geschwister nur wahrscheinlicher, nicht sicher. Den Gentest müssten dann aber auch nicht verwandte Menschen ablegen, da bei ihnen auch ein erhöhtes Risiko behinderter Kinder besteht.

I think the problem is that the a lot of the British expats refuse to learn Spanish. That leads to closed communities, where they have their own restaurants, bars, supermarkets, and hang out with other expats only. The result is that is very rare for Spaniards to have personal relationships with English speakers, and therefore there are few opportunities for practising the language. They only need a small subset at work, and they don't have opportunities to improve their skills in their personal lives.

What I find interesting is the situation of the 2nd generation of expats. Their parents don't speak a word of Spanish but they attended Spanish public schools and have a lot of Spanish friends. They studied the same English as a regular Spanish student, and therefore their written English is just terrible, although they are bilingual and keep the accent of the city of origin of their family.

2. True - no promises. But it's the closest it's been for years.  The left is notorious for fighting among themselves over dogma, I think that pretty much everyone but KKE ( i.e ANTARSIA, SYRIZA, the smaller leftist groups) have said yes to some form of cooperation. 

3. I was thinking about Kamenos, Kouvelis, Bakoyanis. Kamenos platform is right-wing, it's pretty easy for him to move to the big old party or at least support a coalition government. Same for Kouvelis - he said something along the lines of whatever has been signed is a done deal - so I can see him taking part in coalition government (he changed that later, but he's flirting too much with being part of a non-leftist coalition). Bakoyanis differences with ND are on a personal level (for proper neo-liberalism I guess you have ""Drash"" and ""Dimiourgia ksana"" or whatever it's called.  In think, on a practical sense, all these guys are pretty much equivalent.

Kamenos is relying solely on ND voters who hate the loan situation. If he does a U-turn, then his voters will have his head, probably. Do you think it's just a ruse on the part of ND to pretend to be both pro and against the loans? It seems doubtful.

As far as non-native Germans learning/understanding German, I do not think there would be many cases where a non-native could pick up on the small innuendos of the language that a native would be less capable of doing.  Non-native ears are not as trained to listen to both the pronunciation and the context of words at the same time, as a native would be able to do.

* First, the bulls used in bullfighting are an artificial breed created by humans, pretty much like a German Shepherd or any other dog breed. So basically, if bullfighting disappears, what would be lost is an artificial species. See here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miura_bull for the history of a particular breed of fighting bulls. 

* The second consideration is a bit more complex to explain and it is related with what should be legally allowed as a form of entertainment. The *corrida* is ritualized animal torture, it is very difficult to deny that the bull goes trough extreme suffering during the entire event. At the same time, many aspects of bullfighting are fascinating, like the story of Juan José Padilla. These are the elements that followers of bullfighting love to see and hear about but, as I said, at the end the core of bullfighting requires an immense amount of animal cruelty. 

Personally, I find a show that revolves around torture disgusting and, going back to your original point, if the fighting bull disappears with the *corrida*, not much would be lost.  ",0,1334277178,null,0,false,0,c4bm85m,t3_s6uyr,t1_c4bm85m,t1_c4blbnh,null,1428709970,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Romania paid *all* the state debt during the 80s. We started the 90s as a debt free country, yet our economy still went to shit during the decade.

You may recall that he's been pretty much shunned since the hypocrisy of his membership in the Waffen-SS came out, overshadowing the literary work he's known best for (The Tin Drum).

For beer, best go outside the city limits, locate a place called Oberursel just outside Frankfurt or Bad Homburg. They are even on the local transport system. For Oberursel, check out Vetters and for Bad Homburg, the Kronenhof/Zeppelin Brewery (both good brew pubs).

The politicans whose opinions actually do matter made it CLEAR that the euro will not be allowed to fail because of the unknowns surrounding it, now please stop spreading misinformation based on what you read somewhere by some other hater who also has no clue.

Is the euro facing political problems as it currently exists? Absolutely! This problem however will be solved soon.. it just takes time.

And then it gets funnier.. all of the factors that are being used against the eurozone such as unemployment and low growth exist globally right now, including your superior country. I hope your country prints lots of money and then you can fill up your car with petrol using 5000 of your currency, but that's okay, because your currency is good and the EU is evil... and you will have many big numbers in your pocket!

Btw... check out the growth and unemployment in Romania, Latvia and Hungary... they don't use the euro -- they have their own currency and they can print whenever they want... and they are doing worse than the eurozone.. that could be your country soon as well.. but you know.. this is obviously irrelevant, because they are not you.. everyone else is screwed and you are the best :)

I think that another thing that is not mentioned here is that in some European countries *IVF falls under social healthcare and is therefore paid by taxpayers.*

In this light, some restrictions might make more sense. For example, where I live there is a restriction on age (I believe you can try up till the age of 47) and a restriction on the number of times you can try. Now this makes sense because the state is actually paying for your procedure, but it has drawn a line as to what it finds acceptable. The likelihood of success does go down with age, so there's a point where it is decided  that state money will no longer be spent on this. 

In some countries you are also not allowed to sell parts of your body, including sperm or eggs. Egg donation is not forbidden, but you're not allowed to pay someone for it (barring expenses). They basically have to be voluntary donations. These laws are put in place so that richer (but infertile) couples cannot take advantage of poor young girls who would be willing to sell eggs or have their body used as an incubator just because they need some cash.

None of these have to do with discrimination of infertile couples, or  some sort of Catholic conspiracy.

Please do explain how will you keep a monetary policy for countries like Germany with a booming economy that needs specific meassures and countries like Portugal and Greece where the economy is all but destroyed with skyrocketing unemployment? 

The entire problem from the beginning of this crisis till now is like the poster above said,in the US you have federal interest first, in the Eurozone you have national interest first, if the countries don't pull the head out of their asses and start thinking for Europe and not only for their next national elections the Euro will fail, no matter how much you or I like it.

Also you should check growth and unemployment of Greece, Portugal and Spain.

Decent agendas are those that are shown to be correct either by science or by time.

All policy making has a scientific basis. Why are the most advanced countries investing in green energies? Why are they investing in education? All of these political choices have a reason behind them. It's either because studies predict that the policies will result in X and Y or because similar policies have resulted in X and Y in other countries.

Now, what can we gather from countries that decided that the extreme right wing was right? Based on empirical evidence from the 3rd reich, the bosnian war and so on, I can predict that such policies would be destructive at best.

Now, are you going to choose policies that promote progress, peace and natural balance or are you going to cater to the minorities that want ethnic cleansing or those that want maximum short-term profits?

Page 22 to 26 you have the price per minute for voice when you're abroad, per country. ""Pays en cours d'ouverture"" means that it's not available yet but planned, ""pays ouvert"" means it works.

true,Oda_Krell,EURO,"German, living in the Netherlands","Okay, I admit, my response sounded a bit angrier than it should have, but this habitual blaming of ""German interests"" in this whole mess of a financial crisis is really not helpful. I usually restrain myself and don't just casually blame ""Greek laziness"", so I expect that others (at least on a pan-European forum like this) in return avoid making claims about egotistical Germans that only think about their own welfare and are willing to destroy Europe. They/we're not, at least most of us aren't.

Anyway, the US comparison doesn't really work, for one simple reason: as far as I know, the US federal budget is independent of the state budgets, and does not include regular ""transfers"" from the federal level to the state level.

(Disclaimer: I tried to find English sources for this knowledge that I read about a while ago in an article, but I can't find anything. If anyone knows the details, please feel free to chip in or correct me).

In other words, the US system is essentially that of the EU, *before* the crisis. There are parts of the EU budget that contain subsidies and investments to overcome structural differences between regions, but by and large, each country is responsible for its own budget. That's the situation in the US as well. Which, for example, lead to the huge budget crisis in California a few years ago.

However,in the EU, this has changed, because of the financial crisis hitting some countries in Europe especially hard, pushing them to the brink of default. So it made sense to install some kind of non-permanent transfer mechanism -- which is what the ESM + EFSF essentially are, taking money and collateral from the ""safe"" countries to offset some of the debt of the debtor countries. 

Please note: I actually think that this is, at least for now, the right thing to do. But this is a major difference to the US, where, even though the states are politically more integrated into the federal system than the European nations are in the EU, their budgets are, as far as I know, completely detached from the federal budget, i.e. less integrated compared to the EU of today.

I always think a (semi)appropriate comparison is how young Germans tried to ""cleanse"" themselves of the old Nazis, during the 60s protests. I'm going to simplify it a bit here, but there were two big things going on: for one, huge protests, riots, moral outrage by young students that couldn't believe that half of their professors and half of the German judges were just the old guys that were already in their positions under the Nazis. It seems to me that Greece got that part, the protests, down already.

But there was a second part, perhaps more important: young people entered politics and law *themselves* to change the system from within. Now, I don't want to glorify the politicians that they became (e.g. Joschka Fischer) too much, maybe you like them, maybe you don't, but at least, they did what they could to change and replace a system that was much, much worse.

Let me try again, for hard of thinking. 

Grass is presumptively an antisemite for:

+ **volunteering**  for (not being forced into)  the German military right towards the end of the war
+  for joining the Waffen SS and for not attempting to run away
+ and for then guiltily keeping mum about it for half a century

We have many counter examples that demonstrate very clearly that none of these things *had* to happen. The current Pope is just one notable such example.

So Grass is in a difficult position subsequently. Our presumption, as I say, is that he's antisemitic; and his attack on Israel but no other of the many countries around the world who are far, far worse in many, many ways underline the presumption.

And if you don't like ad hominems, just tell me the facts about Israel; don't tell me that Grass has written a poem.

You don't even know there's a difference between fascism and nazism. You are uneducated, and stupid.

true,Eryemil,ESPA,Spain,"&gt;I don't think culture and religiosity is any valid argument for accepting and/or barring a country to the EU. 

I disagree. 

&gt;France and Hungary, for example, could be considered gross violators of animal rights since they force-feed geese to make the liver taste better, while defending it as a national right on account of cultural tradition.

Human rights &gt; animal rights and I say that as a vegetarian who is greatly concerned with animal suffering. 

&gt;Infant circumcision however, should not be banned and is IMHO in no way counter to European values if it is done either soon after birth (when the child won't remember the ordeal) or after the age of majority, when they'll be able to decide for themselves.

I strongly disagree and so do a few of our most progressive countries; yours being one of them if I remember correctly. But this is not the place for that particular discussion.  

&gt;Moreover, despite high religiosity, Turkey has a strong and long tradition of secularism, similar and actually even based on to France's laicism, especially in the western parts.

Turkish secularism is not anything to write home about. It's looking more and more untenable every year. I wonder how much of [this](http://www.newscientist.com/data/images/archive/2565/25653701.jpg) is due to religion and how much is simply lack of education.

Ce n'est pas que quelques allumés extrémistes qui pensent ou évoquent un tel conflit, c'est un pourrissement de la situation avec deux cotés bien identifiés :

- D'un coté tu as les européens ou occidentaux en général, pure souche ou métissés de 2nde et 3eme génération et donc bien assimilés, de culture (mais pas nécessairement de culte) chrétienne, qui sont attachés à un mode de vie occidental typique (consommation, épanouissement personnel, individualisme, libertés fondamentales...)

- De l'autre tu as une culture ancienne à tendance rétrograde, qui arc-boute sur des textes religieux médiévaux comme seul référence pour maintenir une société qui leur semble cohérente, et qui dans le cas des flux migratoires, reproduisent le même modèle social dans tous les pays qui construisent des ghettos plutôt que des politiques d'acculturation.

Les valeurs de ces deux groupes sont trop différentes pour cohabiter, et en France, le deuxième groupe, représenté par les islamistes fondamentalistes, se sert du communautarisme et de la paupérisation des ghettos pour conforter sa présence.

La réaction, en mode ""réflexe de bête blessée"", de la branche conservatrice de la société française est de traiter ce communautarisme comme une invasion, voir une infection. Et vu la difficulté à établir un dialogue et trouver des compromis permettant la cohabitation avec des mecs aussi cons et bornés que des fondamentalistes, on peut pas trop leur jeter la pierre.

Faut pas perdre de vus la définition même d'une nation : un peuple (voir ethnie), une culture (voir un culte), une langue, une monnaie (ou autre convention d'échange), et des règles de vie communes (la loi).

Quand tu prends deux nations et que tu les mets sur le même territoire, pas besoin d'aller chercher très loin dans les news pour voir que ça se passe mal. Israël, Soudan, Rwanda... Donc en toute logique, alors que la tension monte entre la nation française et l’embryon de nation islamiste qui s'installe et se structure dans certaines zones, on peut se dire que ça va finir par péter.

Les issues possibles sont les suivantes :

- Mode bisounours : les connards fondamentalistes et les connards xénophobes sont moins cons que leur définition ne le suggère et ils trouvent un terrain d'entente. Ca veut dire pas de Charia en France (trop opposée aux principes du droit en vigueur), pas de discrimination sur l’ethnie ou la religion en contre-partie. Une liberté de culte modéré, garantie par la constitution de l’état laïc, mais les extrémistes de tout bord seront expulsés ou enfermés dès qu'ils deviennent violents, sans quoi ça met la société en danger.

- First Strike préventif : méthode Guéant / Le Pen : des charters et de la répressions, mais dans ce cas il ne faut pas le faire à moitié car les poches non ""nettoyées"" deviendront de plus en plus violentes car oppressées. C'est la protection de la culture dominante contre le risque d'invasion, ça peut se finir comme en Syrie.

- Sécession : les nations antagonistes se répartissent les territoires et richesses et font leur vie de leur coté. Impensable en France, mais c'est ce qui se passe au Soudan.

- Guerre civile : le plus fort éradiquera le plus faible et poursuivra le conflit avec ses soutiens externes. C'est le scénario évoqué dans l'image, et qui à l'heure actuelle semble être le plus réaliste si les islamistes ne se calment pas un peu.

Note que mon intention jusque là n'est pas de prendre parti, et que je reconnais la légitimité d'une communauté musulmane au sein de la société française en vertu de la laïcité de l'état français. Ne pas le reconnaître requerrait, par principe constitutionnel d'égalité, qu'aucune religion ne soit autorisé... Ce qui serait alors contraire à la liberté de culte.

Par contre, et c'est bien pour ça que certains parlent d'islamisation, c'est aux communautés de cultures minoritaires de s'adapter à leur terre d'accueil et pas l'inverse. Et tant que des zélotes islamistes tenteront de faire appliquer la Charia (les morceaux en contradiction avec le droit français) sur le sol français, même à leur domicile, alors leur comportement est criminel et ils sont responsables de l'envenimement de la situation.",0,1334434990,null,0,false,0,c4ca0j4,t3_s912m,t1_c4ca0j4,t1_c4c5fvc,null,1428721551,13,false,france,t5_2qhjz,13

Condolences to the families, they must be going through a living hell right now. It's not normal, nor easy to get your child killed in these circumstances.

Everybody has ""quite a bit of problems"" with everyone in the Balkans. We all know that.

What we don't know is who/what/why did this.
Jumping to conclusions that ""the others"" did it is purely speculation and only adds fuel to fire.

I just hope that the situation gets cleared soon, because the more this uncertainty lasts the more there's a chance that people will come to prejudices and jump into conclusions and speculations without any further proof.
