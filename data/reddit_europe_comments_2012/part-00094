Which patently isn't going to work.

If a real debate about a ""federal europe"" had started a year ago and we were now in the process of going through the necessary constitutional changes and referendums to make it happen then I would fully understand all the can kicking.

But none of that has happened, instead Spain now seems likely to require a bailout which just about might be possible, but after that comes Italy who's interest rates are not far behind Spain's. 

Is there enough money for a bailout of Italy?

The only viable solution I see left is some kind of managed breakup, I know that is not popular here, but *no one* is doing anything to actually prevent it now, that's where we're drifting towards, slowly but surely.

That statement is 100% true to the core and as someone who is living and working i the US, I see it on a daily basis.  
  
Most Americans have been brainwashed over decades to believe you can not survive without guns and a lot of them because either A) the government will get you or B) some bad guy will kill you just because. I have never in my close to 20 years living here, had any use for any gun. Not to mention, according to most Americans you should not survive in a country without guns. This of course is a problem for them when faced with facts but as every great American knows, facts have a liberal bias so they shouldn't really be take too seriously.

Incorrect!  
You can be as responsible as you possibly can, take every precaution there is, but you can still get killed at the blink of an eye because society as a whole is not doing the same. This is not a personal issue but a social issue. Without enacting social change, you will forever be living in fear and were you will never be able to achieve your goal of taking responsibility for your own protection.  
  
You can be 100% responsible but still become a victim because it is not up to you ALONE! You don't think countries with low crime is down to people taking responsibility for their own safety do you? No, they are down to the social situation in that country! As long as you have a large swat of your population living in abject poverty, a high number of crimes and often very violent crimes, is to be expected.

No, it's really not. Ultimately, the one who loses out biggest if you die is you. You are the one who has the most interest in your own survival, and because of that it is your own responsibility.

Society has some responsibility, but ultimately the cost of a failure on their part falls primarily to you.

If something dangerous is happening, Police will not be there as it happens. They will be there *after* to conduct an investigation, but that doesn't do the dead person any good.

&gt;Without enacting social change, you will forever be living in fear and were you will never be able to achieve your goal of taking responsibility for your own protection. 

Yeah, we don't live in fear. Helplessness - to me - is a far more scary feeling than personal responsibility.

&gt;You don't think countries with low crime is down to people taking responsibility for their own safety do you? No, they are down to the social situation in that country!

The two are not mutually exclusive. You have society make as many people as possible safe, then allow for people to take care of themselves *when society fails*.

No one is advocating for eliminating the police and dealing with everything personally. It's just for ""worst case"" scenarios.

&gt;As long as you have a large swat of your population living in abject poverty, a high number of crimes and often very violent crimes, is to be expected. 

Yup. And disarming the population will do nothing to deal with poverty.

Or I could realize I have a very incomplete set of data to work with and refuse to generalize that to all of America.

What you should have written is:

Instead you've written it as if it's already proven and widely known information. That applies ALL ACROSS AMERICA. Which is a lot of people and a huge area.

Your opinions on Zeitgeists of different groups are most likely WRONG. They are from incomplete data, and a limited set of people. For example, I meet a lot of English in hostels. Now I could easily form an opinion about this group of people and think easily that all English people behave themselves like this. But if I think deeper I would think wait... these are the people that visit hostels, that have enough money to travel/ want to work and travel and they're mostly young. What about people who don't belong to that set?

Please remember that the average police response time in America is 6 minutes. That is a long time if someone is attacking you. Also, as an avid shooter I can tell you that I could literally tear up any place on Earth with hundreds and I literally mean hundreds of bullets in just 5 minutes time.

Yes you just read that right. And I would endure the psychological torture of knowing I killed another person, because it means you and your family along with myself, get to walk out of that theater without being riddled with hot, supersonic lead.

I hope this maybe makes you think about the issue from a different lens.

Just like we do today unfortunately. Recently more and more has been coming out about mistreatment of prisoners of war and how prevalent it still is...how prisoners of war are raped and humiliated by their current keepers (remember the human pyramid in Afghanistan?).

My point was merely to say that guns/bombs do not lower this number. The harm you can inflict with a single bomb dropped from an airplane, in a region that someone thinks/has intelligence reports that militants exist in, outmatches the harm you can inflict with a catapult that is used in a battlefield even if it straight hits the center of an innocent by-standing village. 

Additionally, the looting, pillaging and plundering that you speak of is not a consequence of weapons (swords vs guns) but a consequence of conquest of land and extending one's kingdom. That matter is for the most settled. What I am trying to say, is that if the medieval people had guns, the would do the same they did then, except the results would have been more drastic, because they would killed many more people much easier. It still exists, as it does in the heart of man - to rape, to pillage, to plunder. To kill an entire city and then to claim that bombs have lowered potential other deaths...the only deaths you have claimed to reduce is your own countrymen...and even that isnt necessarily true if you include the recent upsurge of retaliations. (read : 9 - 11 bombings, london train bombings and any such terrorist attacks) 

I can argue that world war II had far many more deaths than any crusader attack or village plunder with swords. The consequences of a single trigger pulled or button pressed today is far far more widespread and devastating. I assure you there is a reason world war II was NOT contrarily named...61 million casualties... no crusader army/Mongols have ever killed or pillaged that many men, women or children.

The mistake of slashing one sword is far less devastating than the error of pushing one button to timely and appropriately release an atom bomb. But this is superfluously dramatic.

true,flyingkangaroo,null,null,"First of all, let me address the one point you seem to take issue with the most.

&gt; You and your family in your town where you live don't know your neighbors? 

I agree that I was probably overstating things in that sentence. However, that one error of mine doesn't negate the numerous other points which I made. American individuals and families do live in a personal bubble. There isn't nearly as much sense of community in this country as you would find in Australia or Canada or New Zealand.

&gt; For example, I meet a lot of English in hostels. Now I could easily form an opinion about this group of people and think easily that all English people behave themselves like this. 

Hostels are wonderful places to see a cross-section of different value systems from various nations. I disagree with you; I think the bell curve of cultural attitudes is represented statistically quite well in various situations such as hostels.  Naturally, every person's experience is going to be incomplete, and every survey is going to have a margin of error, however forty years has put me in close contact with a monumental number of people both in my own country and abroad... and my perceptions have been molded by that.

&gt; One thing I've found is that people from the same country can be VERY different and that includes the USA.

Again, you eloquently state the fundamental difference in my perspective as compared to yours. To me, the visual illustration I use to describe this is that if you live for many years in a certain valley, the mountains on either side of you are going to seem very large and they're going to be a subject of much musing and meditation. If you see the same mountains from an airplane as part of a mountain range, you're going to see that those geological features are not unique, but that they are repeated again and again over the landscape. There's nothing inaccurate with either perspective. Both people would be right in how they see things.

&gt; In addition, I claim it's dangerous to spread such limited and one-sided opinions through a place like Reddit where the most sensational thing posted is sent right to the top.

You really should lighten up. I don't zealously seek impact in the interest of setting trends of ideas here on Reddit these days like I did, years ago. I have seen ideas that I myself spearheaded grow to become big movements online and even begin to take their place in public policy; Years ago, I was originally seen as the one crazy voice out there who believed it - talking vociferously about things like men's rights, overmedication of children, and certain arguments about how to develop green energy. I'm not speaking loudly enough to have this sort of impact anymore. You needn't worry about me.

However, it does irk me that people always are ungrateful and abusive when a person comes out with a new frame of reference on something. I guess, it's just part of the rhythm of my experience of the internet, though. I don't waste my time writing lengthy comments based on perspectives I've heard somewhere else. I only write things where I think some new light needs to be shed on an issue. Because of this, people like you will always hate me - and be yelling at me that the unfamiliar ideas I present are dangerous or some such thing. Sorry about that... but the internet brings all sorts of personalities together, and we have to learn to live with one another.

I'll tell you where I see danger. I see it in the numerous gun-loving posts in this very conversation thread today where people justify what seems like a crazy attitude to people in other Western countries about gun control, or lack thereof. In my estimation, those are the dangerous ideas - whereas I'm one small voice which is trying to put those comments into perspective so that we can all understand where each of us is coming from. 

 At any rate, today, Reddit is a seething pot of acerbic attitudes and passionately held opinions - and it's not going to be changed much by one lone person stating his observations about one topic or the next.

However, I kind of agree with this comment:

&gt;It's to do with climate. Once air conditioning became cheap, the American South suddenly put on a spurt of growth. Prior to that they struggled because it was impossible to work in the heat and humidity (and if you doubt this, visit Florida in the high summer and see how unbearable it is outside). It's also notable that southern Europe simply doesn't use as much air-conditioning as they need and nowhere near as much as the Americans, thanks to EU regulations on saving energy.

&gt;In hot climates you are constantly getting dehydrated which causes exhaustion. In extreme places like sub-saharan africa the temperatures are so fierce that you'd die if you tried to work outside past mid-day. Once they can afford air conditioning they too will suddenly put on a growth spurt.

&gt;Of course extreme cold hinders you too - it's the reason Siberia isn't as rich as western Russia, and the reason why the Scandinavians were backward backwaters till they invented affordable central heating in the 20th Century, and then they suddenly put on a growth spurt.

&gt;Britain has a lucky climate. It's not too hot and not too cold. It's on the same latitude as NewFoundland, but thanks to the gulf stream, it has a pleasant temperate climate.

Ninja Add: Let me elaborate... I am of the belief that the eurozone project was a test to see which countries would be willing to take a blind step into the unknown in the name of co-operation. It was well known that such a situation would eventually come up, but these countries went ahead with it anyway. Obviously the current crisis has opened some wounds, but I believe every one of the eurozone countries is willing to work together overall and take more steps together. We must remember that the reason a lot of this stuff is so complex is because each country is limited to what they can do legally by their own laws.

Often they'll prey on tourists and their ""feel good mood"" of being on vacation and they'll pretend to be deaf or mute and be all ""hey, donate money to this deaf charity"", so will get money that way.

Another one is someone will go along with a ring hidden in their hand. Bend down in front of tourists and pretend to pick it up, go to them and say ""hey, you dropped this"", to which they reply ""no I didn't"", and they'll say ""you should have it, but maybe you should give me some money for it"" (effectively, in a nut-shell).

[Dionysos](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysos_\(groupe_fran%C3%A7ais\)) is always a safe bet: a really energetic pop rock band (especially in concerts where Mathias Malzieu runs and jumps everywhere) singing in French and English.

If you're more into punk music, you can have a look at [les Wampas](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_wampas) based around Didier Wampas, a charismatic electrician working for the company in charge of the subway system in Paris.

Last but not least, allow me to dig up a psychedelic / jazz-fusion band which is quite old but still touring (I saw them in Lyon 2 years ago): [Magma](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_\(groupe\)). It's quite impressive to see the mythology they developped around their band's concept (they have their own language which they sing in, their own History and so on).",0,1343092618,null,0,false,0,c5iecmi,t3_x14ak,t1_c5iecmi,t3_x14ak,null,1429452263,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

It wasn't just a man who went crazy, the system simply wasn't followed in that case and the whole thing is extremely sinister for even more reasons than a man carrying out a shooting in a school.  You don't get D-Notices from the PM silencing the media, former foreign secretaries (Cook again) calling for fresh investigations, witnesses not called, and key figures calling it a whitewash, and for there not to be something else at play.

Even with the system in place at the time the events of early 90s could have played out a thousand times and every single time had the system been followed then Thomas Hamilton would have failed to receive a gun license a thousand times over - and spectacularly so.  Yet this local odd ball, banned from being a scout leader, known and investigated by the police for counts of paedophilia,  who was known to have held serious grudges with the local village whom he blamed for his business failing (again connected though their suspicion of his paedophilia).  Someone Lord Robertson himself admits to having had arguments with in his own home!?  

Dunblane was clearly a shooting; but it's far too sinister to just put it down to gun laws and random individuals losing the plot.  Occam's Razor suggests a connection with Operations Ore and Avalanche where the FBI provided a British sting operation with thousands of credit cards attached to child pornography, some of which were, according to the FBI, connected with high offices in government...and then there's a 100yr  national secrecy order is placed on Dunblane.

I think the reason Sweden hasn't had a shooting like that is that other ways of terror suited the terrorist better.

I hope that the Swedish system works, but it is clearly not perfect. Certainly it has not been effective at eliminating the possibility of getting a gun.

I and my wife have about 60k in government student loans together. The interest on these loans is tied to the interest rates the (Dutch) government pays. Before the crisis it used to be 4%. Now the interest on our loans has been set at (the government rate of) 1.3% for the next 5 years.
So the economies in trouble have sent me about 8100 euros for being born in the right country. It does seem a bit unfair.

But I think I will eventually repay it through tax money going south. 

For me the best development would be a massive increase in inflation. Up from 2% to say 8% or 10%. The little money that I have is all in my house, stocks and my business while my liabilities are all in very low interest loans with rates that are fixed for the next 5 to 10 years. High inflation would cause my liabilities to devalue while my assets would appreciate. 
With the current developments in the euro zone a devaluation of the euro (and inflation) doesn't seem unlikely. It would help the southern countries with their debts. Also economic opinion leaders in the Netherlands have been calling for wage increases to stimulate domestic consumption and to rebalance our trade surplus. If implemented this would lead to further inflation, increase in income and devaluing of loans.
As you can imagine: I'm all for europe. 

From the perspective of my business: It was started in 2008 so I can't compare it to the situation before the crisis. I hear that some clients (governements) have to cut back spending but it seems that this has not really affected their willingness to purchase.

Everything is way more expensive, contrary to popular opinion decreasing salaries and cutting on everything does not makes prices go down.

Benedict Arnold anyone? AIPAC espionage scandal anyone? What that little piece of paper is supposed to indicate, is which countries have allegiance to me. Which country would for ex, speak for me if I were to be held hostage by pirates. That is the legal principle. 

As for the practical matter of how to run the state... the US (along with a couple of other rich countries) historically has built its fortune on attracting the best and the brightest. 

In Europe, that means that all the smart expats move to the place which gives decent professional opportunities... but whose government doesn't harass them simply for trying to live there as a foreigner. Recently, the Dutch banned double citizenship. Result: lots of educated , dutch speaking americans, canadians and so on now live in Brussels &amp; Antwerp instead of Amsterdam. Brain Drain. 

As for voting and holding office, a good democratic principle is that the state should gather input from everybody who has a stake in it. In my personal case (american living in Europe), we are also allies &amp; trading partners who have overlapping geopolitical interests. But with that said. At the local level, it matters even less. Obama doesn't have opinions about how the tram in Antwerp should be run. But I do. 

In fact, I would not draw the line until my country's citizens volunteer for some other country's army. Even then, there have been some examples which the US went along with... and can be proud of today.

Hell.. a few years ago the German and French had the [""sick man""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_man_of_Europe) economies while the PIIGS were booming.

Anyway, allow me to dispel some of common myths.

Myth #1: Protestant Work Ethic
 
Pure nonsense. After excluding the outliers Norway and Luxembourg, Catholic PIIG Ireland tops the [GDP per Labour Hour](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=LEVEL) followed by Netherlands, Belgium, France and then Germany.

The real driver of productivity is a global focus with an orientation towards exports and FDI to drive competitiveness. For example, a world-class banking system gives tiny Luxembourg a GDP per Labour Hour more than double New Zealand. It wouldn't be reasonable to suggest that Kiwis work only half as hard though would it?

Myth #2: Southerners Don't Work; Are Lazy

Labour productivity is considerably lower in Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain. This is not from deficiencies in the people but is the consequence of a large, successful tourism sector. 

Unlike export-driven manufacturing, tourism is highly labour intensive with process efficiency subordinate to customer satisfaction and service quality. Hiring additional labour actually [drives potential value](https://docs.google.com/open?id=1IHmhPWXeCF8kug4q6MUPr5_4Q2-OgMT5fYuBZhy50sMqf1UQJp7NLn2lf1C7). Irregular hours, part-time or temporary workers and seasonality further obscure productivity measures. A tourism sector is an economic gift not a curse; although, misinterpreting metrics sure makes it look like one.

I'd like to see a source for that - I seriously doubt such a thing, because, let's face it, the German reunification was a pretty higgledy-piggledy affair after things utterly fell apart within the space of less than a year in the East.  Kohl managed to present everyone with a sort of ""fait accompli"", because hey, what else were they going to do with the DDR?

As for the Euro, currency integration was not a new idea, the concept had been around since even before the 1974 EUA.  

I would even argue that the existence of a unified currency has helped, rather than hobbled, Germany, as it's tremendously strengthened the European export market, alongside the breakdown of customs rules.  In fact, the main countries bitching about German disregard for the stability &amp; growth pact were small, responsible ones like the Netherlands, which stayed pretty well within the boundaries of their responsibilities.

The problem is not the unified currency per se, nor the ""weaker"" countries that are members of the currency.  If you look at, say, Portugal/Ireland and Italy, despite waste and corruption the former two have responded with admirable speed to the need for austerity, despite pain, instituting great (and needed) structural reforms - and the latter has a fundamentally healthy economy.  The same can be said for Spain.  The issue right now is not that these countries in and of themselves are broken, but that they are suffering massive knock-on effects from not just Greece but a bunch of other structural weaknesses.  

If you think about it - most of the things the EU and ECB are doing right now, which are insufficient at the present, would have been way more than enough to forestall this shitstorm if they'd had the courage to do it a year or two ago.

Es una pregunta difícil de responder, porque depende enteramente de ti y de tus preferencias.

Dejando de lado la situación económica actual, y suponiendo que puedas encontrar un trabajo más o menos bien remunerado, en España se vive bien o mal dependiendo de lo que tú consideres importante.

Si el sol, las temperaturas altas, el mar, las playas, el ambiente relajado en los bares, la gente en la calle hasta bien entrada la noche, el trato cordial y la familiaridad entre la gente, la comida elaborada, local, a buen precio y elaborada con ingredientes frescos son elementos importantes para ti, entonces creo que vivirías a gusto en España.

Si por el contrario aprecias el orden, la puntualidad, la eficiencia en la burocracia, la cortesía en la carretera (si conduces), la transparencia y seriedad tanto en la empresa privada como en la administración, el silencio y la calma, quizá otros países de Europa encajarían mejor con tu forma de ser.

Por supuesto el factor clave acostumbra a ser de tipo laboral, y en este sentido sí que España en general no resiste bien las comparaciones con otros países del continente, especialmente en los tiempos que estamos viviendo.

true,santsi,FINL,Finland,"It seems to me that generally in USA people tend to think more in absolute [black and white](http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/black-or-white) terms. Maybe it has to do with the outdated two-party political system combined with the Christian worldview where everything can be categorized in either good or evil. The hatred libertarians have towards government is another example of this, when it would be more constructive to pragmatically think of ways to better the quality of the government. Just by removing the government you are only moving the problem to elsewhere (actually I agree that governments will become obsolete by voluntary organizations at one point, but libertarians aren't having this discussion, they have faith that you can just apply the free market method to solve every societal problem).

Americans also tend to understand things from the individual's perspective rather than seeing the society as a whole. That explains why they are so obsessed with winning. It's more important to win an argument, than it is to further the discussion. Also their common law system fits in this world view very well as well, which resembles more of a sports match between two competing law proposals, where one side is declared to be an eternal winner based on one case. When in civil law system the procedure resembles more of how human conflicts would be solved in a scientific manner. First we form the basic rule and every case is an instance of that law.

Zur Erinnerung:

&gt; Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, German Federal Minister of Defence, was awarded a summa cum laude doctorate by the Faculty of Law, Business Administration and Economics in 2007. After extensive plagiarism in zu Guttenberg's dissertation was revealed in February 2011, German media also criticised the University of Bayreuth. A University spokesman has denied allegations of bribery and political corruption. The University cancelled the doctorate and Guttenberg was forced to resign.

Et pour mes nouveaux compatriotes français : il ne faut pas prendre ces commentaires mal. J'adore la France et ces ne sont que des observations de con. :)

You're probably just starting to feel what French culture really is. Coming from somewhere like SF, you are bound to feel that French culture is a bit conservative. (I'm from Wyoming and I found the opposite to be true and fell head-over-heels in love with it. I find that it's big, nuanced, a bit rigid, and wonderfully refined.)

If there's one overriding thing I've come to understand about the French over the years, it's how profoundly different they are from the Americans. And it's not just that they know how to cook well, live well, take vacations, speak at polite volume level in public, and make their socks match. Their logical premises and worldview are fundamentally different than those of your average American.

I find that they are far better at nuanced, critical thinking, but worse at thinking outside the box. They're *very* entrenched in certain cultural norms (especially surrounding food) and they are generally risk averse, hence their skepticism towards innovation and their overwhelming love for being over-insured.

For Americans, it is completely the inverse: we will change on a whim if some new, bright idea pleases us, and we reward/admire innovative, risk-taking behavior. And if things go badly, we don't care so much. We just pick up the pieces and move on.

Another notable cultural difference is that the French have an equally unhealthy relationship with money as Americans do with sex. They can be frustratingly jealous of success and money (even for themselves, they complain about it often), whereas Americans strive for it.

There you go. Take it for what it is, adapt, and enjoy everything France has to offer. :)",0,1343137260,null,0,false,0,c5ilwhe,t3_x2d97,t1_c5ilwhe,t3_x2d97,null,1429455913,18,false,france,t5_2qhjz,18

true,rotzooi,null,null,"&gt;  What is life like in Spain?

Almost impossible to answer without writing 10 book volumes.
It depends strongly on your own preferences.

Also, do you mean in general or compared to something else?  You live in the U.S., but the differences between Boise and Chicago are just as big as the differences between Barcelona and Corunna.

Let me point out two huge differences: people tend to work to live, not live to work.  This is a major difference between my benchmark, NYC, and *most* Spanish people I know.  Things are changing though - they already were before this whole financial debacle of the last few years and now especially, I feel that this lifestyle may slowly erode.  I *hope* it won't, though.

I find it more important to have a glass of wine with friends at the end of the day, than to work two extra hours and make some more money.  It's pretty luxurious that most people I know can still afford to do this though - as I said, I fear this is slowly changing.

That was a big pro for Spain.  A big con, and it might surprise you, is that family is extremely important.  This is great for Spanish people but not so great if you are an outsider.  It's difficult to really put down into words, but blood family will *always* come first and depending on your situation and relation with people, this makes it difficult to really get close to people and even if you are close, once you lose one relationship, you lose the whole family.

I hope you're not in a hurry: with the current economic climate, only move to Spain if you have a ton of money and plan to live out your life as a retiree (you'll live like a king), or if you have a secure job lined up.

true,LunaMinerva,ITAL,Italy,"&gt;How can the Mafia have such an influence in this day and age?

Good question. 

To make a long story short, it's all due to the degree the Mafia is phisiologically linked to the society. Mafiosi have been 'in business' for more than a century now, and during this time they have deepened their connections with both the economic world and the political one (and the *religious* one as well, might I add) to such an extent that *people who were born in Mafia-ridden places find it normal*. In several occasions local people were actually angered for the capture of the Mafia boss who was in control in their area, since they believed he did *good* (e.g. punishing rapists or child-abusers, funding the festivities for the local patron saint and similar stuff). Yes: believe it or not, to the uneducated and naive those involved in the Mafia appear as benefactors. ~~This is probably the same reason why Berlusconi won the elections four times.~~

And yes, I'm aware it's hard to understand for someone who isn't Italian (hell, most Northern Italians like me have the same problem - unfortunately even politicians). The main issue to be solved is changing people's *attitudes* - and no reform can do that. Sure, you could argue (and with reason) that a better education system - something Italy should work towards, IMHO, regardless of the Mafia problem - could help in raising people's knowledge and awareness and thus lead to the defeat of Mafia (it's no coincidence that education in Southern Italy is below average among EU countries), but it'd still be insufficient. The roots of the problem are even deeper - not to mention how there are *different* regional Mafia networks which work in completely different ways, and whose connections are probably known to mafiosi only.

Yeah, it's a mess.

Natürlich war das nicht alles. Die Computer die bisher für XP gut genug waren, reichten nun nicht. Ebenfalls fiel einiges Peripherie auf einmal weg weil die Treiber nicht verfügbar waren (Server wurden ebenfalls ersetzt). Die Geräte mussten ebenfalls kostenintensiv ersetzt werden.

Allein das hat für Unmut gesorgt. Nun konnten die Mitarbeiter bis heute nicht wirklich nützlicheres sehen. Ich habe bis heute nichts gehört bei dem die Leute sagen würden: „Ja, das ist besser als damals bei XP“.  Die Verschlimmbesserung beim Office Paket hat sogar dazu geführt, dass sich ein Zynismus gegenüber der ganzen Upgradesache installiert hat der von der Chefetage bis zum Sekretariat reicht. 

Unsere Zeichner sind trotz der verbesserten Hardware nicht der Meinung, dass die Performence besser geworden wäre. Die haben bei weitem die beste Hardware in unseren Büros.

Meine eigenen Erfahrungen die ich mit einer Installation von win7 auf einem Testrechner durchgeführt habe, habe ich zwar niedergeschrieben, komme diese Woche aber nicht dran. Das meiste davon handelt den schon oben genannten überflüssigen Schritten, hinter Hyperlinks versteckten Menues von Menues (was gibt es schöneres als sich im Kreis durch die Menues zu klicken...), dämlichen Rückfragen und Lächerlichen Restriktionen innerhalb des Admin Accounts. Nachdem ich dann nach Stunden eine win7 Installation hatte welche ohne Schnickschnack und Verzögerungen funktionierte (da wo es ging), hatte ich ein System welches trotzdem unnötig viele Ressourcen frisst und die simpelsten Sachen wie einen übersichtlichen Explorer nicht bieten konnte.

Ich kann mir die Schmerzen der IT-Abteilung gut vorstellen.

Ich kann mir natürlich auch gut vorstellen, dass ein DAU win7 Kunde damit zufrieden ist. Er wird nie außerhalb des Benutzeraccounts sehen und seinen Computer zur Reparatur bringen wenn er was nicht versteht. Diese Leute sind leicht zu befriedigen und es ist egal was man ihnen zum Fressen vorwirft. Sie werden es eh kaufen. Entweder weil es vorinstalliert ist oder weil sie es nicht besser wissen. Siehe Vista.  

Für den durchschnittlichen Businessuser den ich kenne, hat dieses Windows nichts brauchbares gebracht. Das einzige was es gebracht hat war eine Verlangsamung des workflows.

Beschnittene Säuglinge zeigen heftigere Schmerzreaktionen, etwa bei frühen Impfungen, als unbeschnittene.

Dann gibt es noch die zwar seltenen, aber auch im westlichsten Krankenhaus regelmäßig vorkommenden Komplikationen.

true,tangled_foot,UKGB,United Kingdom,"The trains run, the underground doesn't. Problem is there is basically nothing LU can do about it. I shall explain..

Basically, the London underground is really really old, not the trains and things, they're all quite new, but the system itself is the oldest subway on earth. 

There are two ways to build a subway, one is 'cut and cover' this is the most common, new way, its the one employed by most subways in the world, you dig up a road (cut), lay a train track, and cover it over with the road again (cover). Parts of the london underground were built like this (circle and district lines particularly), these have no problem with temperatures, they're only a foot or so below the ground, they have air conditioning and everything like other subways. 

However, many of London's lines are deep tunnels, hampstead station for example is 60m underground, these are the old tunnels, they are the ones with issues, at that depth ventilation is a massive problem and a lot of stations only use lifts, so its not even as if air can get up where the escalators are. They can't put air con in the trains, because that would heat up the platforms too much, in 2006 it was 47C on the northern line, that's against EU working regulations hot, not to mention how humid it gets down there, they can't just stop the underground though, the entire city would be screwed, so they just put police everywhere and handed out water bottles, there were still lots of stories about people passing out though.

Will be interesting to see what they do, if we get another heat wave.

edit: an additional point based on one of your later posts, no one in the UK (or indeed the rest of northern europe) has air conditioning in their homes, so heat waves can result in more deaths, particularly for the elderly who can't get outside easily. 

Also, you need to take relative humidity into account, I can go to southern spain and walk around in 38C heat and be hot, but ok, however due to the dry climate you would experience the same level of heat in about 32 in the UK.

Sorry, ich kann deine Argumente nicht ernst nehmen. Genau das gleiche wurde beim letzten Update auch geschmarrt. Es sind genau die DAUs die WinXP nachweinen. (Das du mir mit diesem Satz auch mal einfach unterstellt hast, DAU zu sein, ignoriere ich jetzt einfach.) Wenn man sich den Neuerungen nicht quer stellt und alles ignoriert, was verbessert wurde, dann ist es klar, das man im Upgrade nur Nachteile sieht.

Das ein Upgrade in einer großen Firma viel Geld kostet und sehr viel Zeit und Aufwand kostet ist normal. Doch wenn ihr in eurer Firma noch für weitere 10 Jahre WinXP verwenden würdet, würden neue Mitarbeiter kaum mehr mit eurer Infrastruktur zu recht kommen. Es kann nicht immer alles beim alten bleiben.

Es gibt Firmen, die wegen ihrer uralten Infrastruktur noch COBOL Programmierer anheuern müssen, um Fehler zu beseitigen oder neue Funktionen bereitzustellen.

Keine Firma ist dazu gezwungen, zu updaten.

Dem ist nicht so, dies wird bei anderen Betriebssystem schon seit fast 20 Jahren aus gutem Grund so gemacht.

First things first, when you get to Rome you will need gelato source. one of my favorite gelaterias in the city center is near the pantheon and called i giolitti. its famous and very very very good. The address is Via degli Uffici del Vicario, 40 if you have an iphone/smartphone, but if you can remember these directions you can find it on your own.

Stand in front of the pantheon facing away from the front of the building. At the opposite end of the piazza there is a street on the right that exits the piazza, i believe its called via della maddelena. Walk down that street until you come to a T intersection of another small street and take a right. This one is called Via degli uffici del vicario. The gelateria is maybe 50 meters down that street on the right. its got a big green letters that spell Giolliti and there will be a crowd out front. There, now thats your gelato supply sorted.

In terms of stuff to do at night, i would definitely recommend the neighborhood of Trastevere, which is full of great bars and restaurants. Trastevere is very beautiful during the day time as well with a bunch of good shops and places to eat. One of my Favorite restaurants is called Spirito DiVino and is located in this neighborhood on Via Genovesi. Next to trastevere there is an island called isola tiberina theres only a hospital a church and a small gelateria on the actual island, but if you can find the stairs on the left side of the island (facing trastevere) and go down to the water level, you can lie out in the sun against the rocks next to the river. I highly recommend doing this if the weather gods are with you! Its really nice to just sit out in the sunshine if you bring a towel or two, a bottle of wine and some cheese and do it italian style.

As far as museums go, the Vatican is definitely the largest and most exstensive art collection in rome., but it might be overwhelming (not to mention expensive) if thats not really your thing. A nice alternative would be villa borghese which has great sculptures and paintings by bernini, and is smaller and cheaper to visit. This youtube video might help convince you the borghese is just one of those places you HAVE to see in life: (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQDDDaTx_Zc&amp;t=1m30s).  To avoid the long lines you will want to make reservations for both of these museums. The Vatican allows you to book entries into the museums so you can skip the lines outside at either no extra charge or a very minor one. Heres the Vatican ticket office (http://biglietteriamusei.vatican.va/musei/tickets/do). To make reservations for Villa Borghese just call +39 06 32810 to make reservations and pay once you get there.

Piazza Navonna and Campo di Fiori are the two piazzas that will probably be most full with drunken foreigners stopping through rome for one or two nights. i try to avoid this area as an ""american drinking experience"" isnt really what i have in mind when i go out, and also the drinks are a bit overpriced for my tastes... Theres a great club near Piazza Navonna called La Maison, which has a heavy cover charge but its free on wednesdays. Otherwise if you are looking for a nightclub to go to you can go to Testaccio, just tell the taxi driver you want to go to discoteche in testaccio and he will know whats up. Trastevere has the most low key nightlife, but can be very fun place to hang out and drink cheaply. Also there is a great bar called Freni &amp; Frizioni that does aperitivi (italian dishes, cous cous, vegetables, fruits) for free at 7pm very close to piazza trilussa. to find it start in Piazza Trilussa facing the river, and turn right along that main road in front of you, walk about 100m and the next mini piazza with a bunch of people standing in it is where you want to go! The mojitos there are also very good. Also I mentioned the outdoor nightclub Circolo degli Artisti which is out of the city center. You can get there on the Bus 105 from Termini, but you'll probably have to take a taxi back to your hotel.

If you really want an informative experience while in rome i'd suggest hooking you up with my old tour company. ive taken all of their tours and they really do cover a lot more than you could get from it if you were to visit these places on your own. The website is www.througheternity.com and you could take their group tours which wouldnt be too expensive. I definitely recommend you guys check out their Underground Rome group tour, its really an awesome tour to take and it isnt too expensive. ALso the Vatican tour is a good one because the guides will help you to skip the unimportant stuff and put the really great exhibits into context for you (if you spent 1 minute looking at every piece in the vatican you would be there for 4 YEARS!).

Also Rick Steves makes some great podcasts of many different sites and neighborhoods of rome as well as other european cities. If you and Liz have iPods then you can each DL the podcasts and listen to them in tandem for some great free tour guiding.

If  you need any information on opening hours or special events happening in rome, and also to make reservations for most museums, you can call 06 06 08 from any italian phone and it sends you right to the information line for all of Roma.

Villa Borghese
Trastevere

Spanish Steps
Colosseum/Roman Forum (if you buy tickets, get them at the forum not the colosseum as theres never a line at the forum and one ticket is good for both sites as well as the palatine hill)

true,DisregardMyPants,UNSA,United States,"&gt;Yes. Most of the E.U.'s military hardware is built in the E.U. It is home to a massive oil industry and an extremely large munitions industry. If the E.U. was a country, it would be the world's largest arms exporter. Any argument to the contrary flies in the face of the facts.

I never argued that the EU doesn't produce arms.

They do indeed have some of their own hardware, but they're also significantly invested into US hardware. And that hardware becoming useless would be a major blow to their capacity.

&gt;It's true that the U.K. ran through it's available air-to-ground missiles quickly in Libya, but that was without touching the Operation Ready Reserve and with a third of their strike elements embroiled in Herrick. On top of that, the U.K. is only one of 27 nations in the E.U.

The UK is one of the more significant military powers in the EU.

&gt;If the E.U. were one country, its defense spending would be second in the world, and, at €194 billion, roughly a third of that of the U.S. 

Exactly. They spend *a third* of what the United States does.

&gt; It's submarine fleet and AD alone would mean that the U.S. could not successfully invade the E.U.

We have bases everywhere. The submarine fleet would certainly limit our ability to use our Navy, but it's not like we wouldn't have points from which we could strike.

&gt;More U.S. miliary equipment is imported from the E.U. than it is exported to it. E.U. countries provide essential systems for some of the U.S. highest profile projects, and simultaenously produces indigenous hardware, and visa versa.

-never trust a place where they serve paella for one person (unless is thursday lunch). thursday lunchtime many good restaurants have dishes with rice, so that could still be legit. But otherwise no good restaurant will offer a paella for one person. If they say so, it's frozen.

-never trust a paella that will be ready in less than 20-30 minutes. it will be no good.

-never trust a paella for less than 10-12 euros per person.

-never (NEVER!) eat a PAELLADOR paella. they are frozen shit. usually some shitty bars have a extra menu only for mini one person's paella that  are nothing but frozen rice with some colorant.

Außerdem gibt es die weit schlimmere Möglichkeit, das durch einen Exploit oder ähnliches versucht wird Code auszuführen. Wenn dies einem Angreifer unter XP gelingt und das Opfer mit einem Admin Account eingeloggt ist, dann hat der Angreifer bereits alle Rechte und Privilegien die er benötigt, um alles zu erreichen was er will.

Im selben Szenario unter Win7 müsste der Angreifer erst mal den User dazu bringen, die Nachfrage nach Adminrechten zu bejahen. Ich würde mich also User wundern, wenn so etwas einfach so aus heiterem Himmel kommen würde.

Alleine Aero Snap und die Möglichkeit die Taskleiste selbst zu organisieren, reichen mir schon als Argumente. Allerdings auch die Tatsache, das WinXP nur 4GB Ram unterstützt und man mit aktueller Software und großen CAD Zeichnungen manchmal viel Speicher braucht, sind ein Argument. Bei Bildbearbeitung fällt das allerdings um Welten stärker ins Gewicht. Ich habe seit 2006 mehr als 4GB Ram.

Ein Prozess unter WinXP kann im Normalfall nur 2GB des RAMs adressieren (in speziellen Fällen sind auch 3GB möglich). Für reine Office User ist das nicht interessant, aber für jemanden, der die Perfomance braucht schon.

Die Tatsache das es für aktuelle Hardware immer öfter keine XP Treiber gibt, ist auch ein Argument.

WinXP unterstützt die Trim Funktion für SSDs nicht. 

Windows XP unterstützt von Haus aus nicht einmal AHCI. Diese Funktion muss während dem Windows Setup mit einer Treiberdiskette bereitgestellt werden. 
Es macht wenig sinn 11 Jahre nach Release noch an diesem Betriebssystem festzuhalten. 

Natürlich hätte man die alten Office Rechner bei euch in der Firma auch einfach mit XP belassen können. Denn wenn nur Microsoft Office verwendet wird, gibt es absolut keinen Grund für einen Umstieg. Man muss nur ein Kompatibilitätspack installieren und kann dann WinXP bis 2014 noch mit Office 2003 weiterverwenden und neue Formate wie docx verwenden.

Ich werde jetzt nichts mehr auflisten, da das keinen Sinn hat. Wenn du mal nach ""Vorteile Win7"" googlest, findest du was ich meine. Es gibt genügend Seiten, die da ein paar Sachen niedergeschrieben haben.

Concerning theory and practice,  I would say that although the Marxist critic of capitalism is mostly spot on, what should come after it is lacking, and the regimes created were (for the most part - Cuba is doing better than its Caribbean neighbours AFAIK but nothing to brag about...) monstrous. 

A big part of why these things happened is that, in Marx's view, you can only transform successfully societies that have mature to very mature capitalism. Lenin understood that for example to some extend, when he allowed private property and factories in the soviet union (""New Economic Policy""). 

Other massive mistakes include lack of freedom of speech as an integral right of man, not a ""bourgeois"" right.  If you have to silence and kill half your population you are doing it wrong - it's dictatorship gone mad. In the eastern block soviet tanks had to suppress two revolutions (Hungary, Czech republic) - there is something profoundly wrong with this, people should be trying to move IN your utopia not try to overthrow it or flee (e.g. East Germany).  

The dictatorship of the proletariat is very problematic as well, and never properly defined. 

In short, there are issues, but new ideas come up everyday and we have much improved technologies now. For example, if we can decentralise food production, power generation and telecommunications the move will come spontaneously and with people not realising it.

Das Kästchen fragt ob man dieser exe weiterhin trauen kann. Sobald man aber ein Programm installiert hat wird man nicht mehr gefragt. Es ist nun eher unwahrscheinlich, dass man die gleiche Setup.exe noch einmal nutzen wird....

Der User der keine Installationsrechte hat und nicht ein Admin ist, ist hierbei sowieso irrelevant. Ist es der Admin unter einem User account wird die von dir erwähnte Situation IMMER auftauchen wenn er IRGENDWAS installieren will. Somit gibt es keine Differenzierung. Du bist an der Position die ich erwähnt habe. Klickst du die setup.exe, willst du sie ja installieren. Was willst du da noch überlegen??

Im Falle eines Expoits kommt die brain.exe ins spiel. Ein User der dennoch Adminrechte hat wird sich von der Meldung die er eh immer sieht niht davon abhalten lassen eine verseuchte exe auszuführen. Das System selbst behandelt sie ja nicht anders als sonstige exe-dateien. 

Schadsoftware die ohne den Userklick auskommt, wird auch nicht die Meldung aufpoppen lassen. Ist ja nicht so als wäre das etwas überraschendes für die Ersteller. Es ist auch nicht das relevante Thema. -Es geht ja um Meldungen die einer Aktion des Benutzers folgen und diese nochmal Bestätigt haben wollen. Eine Warnung bei Ausführung von exe dateien die nicht durch den User gewollt sind, wären ja kein Problem und supertoll.

Ja die Taskleiste ist super. Wenn man gelernt hat sie anzupassen. Im Endeffekt soll sie aber bei dem Problem helfen, dass die meisten DAUs zu viele Programme in der Leiste laufen haben. Die Rechner meiner Bekanntschafen die ich entmüllen musste hatten neben der Uhr mehr Symbole als in der Taskleiste Platz wäre. Das gleiche gilt für die Gruppierung die dazu führt, dass die normalen User x-mal das gleiche Fenster offen haben ohne es zu merken. Mit entsprechenden Performenceverlusten.

Two of my uncles work in the automobile sector, which was heavily afflicted, but succesfully bailed out. One of the companies went into insolvence, but later reopened. Smallish pay cuts for both of them.  
 
The IT company my third uncle works for was bought by HP, he had to improve his English to work with his new Indian coworkers. Most of his old stuff got laid off. He also had to take a pay cut and now mostly works from home.

  
My parents on the other hand made money, as the EEG (renewable energies law) pays for German farming these days. Together with the EU subsidies of course. We still had trouble getting the proper loans for a new hogbarn at acceptable conditions.

 Its weird, but for us it has gotten better. My brother (21, starting college this fall after an apprenticeship at Mercedes) just took out a credit for 30,000€ at 3.0% to invest into a new windmill. Expected returns are somewhere between 10% - 20%. You do the math on how awesome that is.

Others just had to live with no raises. Like my aunts who work for a tax consulting company and a local city government.  

My cousin is in the oil/ natural gas sector and makes awesome money, since they are still profiting from the Gazprom deal our former chancellor Schröder made with the Russians. My cousin just married and already plans on buying a house at the age of 23.

true,skeeto111,null,null,"True, but a more accurate comparison would be to compare The United States to the European Union, not individual countries like Germany or France. 

The populations are roughly equal, and also violence and homicides vary greatly from State to State within the US. Many more gun deaths in the South and in the big cities in the midwest and out east than in many northern midwestern states and Western cities.

So, although there's about 30,000 people killed by guns every year in the US. There's about 16,000 suicides. So according to Center for Disease Control (for suicide stats) and according the US Department of Justice about 12,500 gun deaths are the result of criminal/gang activity. The other 600-1000 gun deaths are considered ""justifiable"" I guess.
(http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_many_gun_deaths_are_in_the_US_every_year)


So let's just say that there are about 14,000 violent deaths in the US caused by guns, whether being on the defensive or offensive. 

Also, according to this website (which lamentably only has statistics from the 90s) http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcgvintl.html 

The gap in violence between Europe in America is still there but maybe smaller than one would expect. When you add up the firearm homicides of all european countries (per 100,000 people) and then divide that number by the number of countries you get a firearm homicide rate of about 1.05 people per 100,000. 

According to that same website, the number for the United States is about 3.72 people per 100,000, or about 3 times as violent. 

So while the US as a whole is more violent than Europe as a whole you can't totally break it down by country. I could compare gun violence in Iowa compared with Scotland and Scotland would either be more dangerous or equal with Iowa. But I couldn't use this in an argument to say that the US is safer than Britain..

And still, yes the United States has more problems with gun violence but the United States also has greater problems with poverty and education than Europe does. We accept the world's poor and unskilled as immigrants in the hopes they ultimately contribute to America, which they do. However that means many of them live in impoverished communities. 

When you compare the United States to Europe it does look very dangerous. But when you compare the United States to Latin America or Asia it seems quite safe.

There are examples where ""communism"" works great - open source software. Half the internet, most supercomputers, big part of medical devices, half of the smartphones, and some desktop computers run on open source software. This is a huge proof that information economy works differently than economy of material things. 10% of cars driving on roads isn't built by hobbists and given away for free. Your food isn't made for free. But most of the time you use directly or indirectly at least a few programs that are given away for free.

This don't work, just like communism for material things didn't worked out.

IMHO the solution is capitalism and free market for material things and services, and socialism for immaterial things that can be cheaply copied infinitely many times.

You are right. However much of this scarcity is caused artificially. Food for example is in abundance in the modern world, and we can automate it's production fully now. So you can have a small food tax for all basic food and allow competition for more expensive/luxurious stuff. 

We are post-scarcity societies in more than just software and I think we need to push for post-scarcity economics in more walks of life. 

What is going on right now is the opposite though (as you yourself accept), there are active efforts to limit access even to stuff that we can get for free (i.e no or minimal labour required to copy/produce them) rather then the other way around, increasing production to make more areas of the economy post-scarce.

If there is a strong tendency for the currency to appreciate due to outside demand and you are just countering it to keep the value as it is, where is the inflation?

A strong currency also has a lot of advantages. The euro is only ""badly needed"" if Germany wants to keep up its unhealthy focus on exports while neglecting domestic markets. This is not desirable in itself. Germany was already a big exporter with a strong mark, the euro arguably contributed (through capital flowing from Germany to other euro countries) to Germany's painful stagnation, lowering wages and production costs which ultimately increased their exports to current levels. This made them more competitive, but it can be seen as symptom of economic problems rather than a stated goal in itself. Note that with a global recession their shitty ""export champion"" title becomes even less interesting.

About the match, Meazza is a big stadium so if you book the tickets on the first day they're on sale you should be fine even for a derby. (Remember [you'll need a valid I.D. to get a ticket](http://www.bestticket.it/newbt/UI/MilanEng/decreto.htm)). 

In this way you can probably find a seat almost in every sector, but timing is really the key. Keep an eye on Serie A schedule (the ""calendario 2012-2013"" should come out tomorrow). 

According to official AC Milan website, while Italians must have the infamous ""Tessera del tifoso"" to buy tickets online, foreigners are allowed using this [specific link](http://www.bestticket.it/newbt/default.asp?shop_id=MILANENG).


You can usually buy tickets for a match a couple weeks before the date, it's impossible to buy now tickets for a match in March, the only way would be subscribing a season pass. Ticket prices varies a lot, you can get an idea here on the [official tickets price list of Milan](http://www.acmilan.com/it/tickets/price_lists), the stadium map can be found [here](http://www.acmilan.com/en/stadium/map_of_the_sectors).

There are a bunch of distinct financial problems now - US housing bubble, Lehman, banking crisis - but the euro specifically helped the southern states get access to credits at rates which they normally would not have gotten because the interest rates converged with the introduction of the euro.

This caused an unnatural boom and raised inflation. As a result, Greece has become a lot ""more expensive"", meaning what little products they have cannot compete on price internationally, which fuels trade deficits. This could be improved by depreciating the currency, but Greece does not have control over the currency and is forced to stick with the euro currency which is too strong for its productivity. So it needs to devalue by lowering wages and production costs instead, which is currently happening to an extent, but corporations might just pocket the difference. Another alternative would be for everyone else to become more expensive than Greece, such that Greece is cheaper than everyone else on the whole.

The problem is that Greece has no economy or business model to speak of. They didn't just get access to cheap credit but also specifically received many billions in EU subsidies over the past ten years. If that money failed to make them build a competitive economy, why would you expect pouring new money into it to magically work now? Without even addressing the problem that their costs have become far too expensive, and without addressing corruption and ineffective administration? 

Now, austerity isn't working either and I'm not trying to argue that it is. I personally believe that the situation simply cannot be resolved with the current parameters. Greece has far too much debt, it has an uncompetitive economy and it is trapped by a currency that is far too strong for Greek productivity.

Same goes to Russia. I personally am of course strongly against those laws and support freedom. But these eastern ex-soviet countries are still in 60's in many ways. Change is slow. And the problems are huge. This is a law that doesn't change the normal peoples life in Ukraine, they probably support it.

It's probably fair to say that it's not the industrial powerhouse it used to be, but contrary to the dire predictions from a couple of years ago, the population figures appear to be relatively stable now. It's not a city people typically move to to find work. It does have its problems.

However, when you look at it from a student perspective, it's not a bad choice at all. Cost of living is low, very low. The uni is good, it has a large international student body with plenty of bright people, and the city has its own charm. I'd say the biggest downside, from a student perspective, is that the nightlife probably isn't quite as vibrant as in some other places and that train connections are relatively bad (i.e., only regional trains, no comfortable high speed trains).
