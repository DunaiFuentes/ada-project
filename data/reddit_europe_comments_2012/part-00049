The article mentions austerity measures and, in a sense, points to those as being the reason Romanians, and now a majority of the government, want a change of regime.  Sadly, it does not speak of the horrible amounts of corruption that are currently going on. There are countless examples of the current government officials dipping their hands into public funds. To make up for this, or perhaps just to please international observers, the government has attempted to take extremely unpopular measures such as cutting salaries, cutting pensions, etc. As an example for last year (I think), when it was deemed unconstitutional to cut pensions by 15%, they decided to tax them by 16%, which was allowed. All in all, the government is pretty much horrible.

Unfortunately, the other parties aren't any good either. Really, corruption is rampant everywhere in the country (some of you may know about the bribery going on in the healthcare industry). For now, many people don't see a way to fix the current political situation so many take sides with either of the major parties. Not that one is any better than the other. 

TL;DR: Romanian politics are corrupt, no solution  in the near future (in my opinion).

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"Soviet Union collapsed so quickly because they were in threat of having a large scale famine. The country for long had imported big amount of their wheat from the west and paid back with oil and gas. In the 80s due to both collapse of oil prices and collapse of the Soviet oil and gas production, the country couldn't any more pay to import food. The west refused to help unless the country would transform itself, and as the Soviet leaders had no other option, the Soviet Union collapsed.

Now the problem with Soviet economy was that in many parts of it, people and institutions had moved from monetary economy to bartering. For example factories swapped goods with each others and paid salaries with goods that they had produced. Hence nobody knew the real value of anything. Furthermore organizations themselves were bloated and inefficient, instead of creating value organizations usually wasted it, thus few organizations actually had any value.

So, the country went into a desperate situation very quickly, there wasn't much time to plan or design, actually it is good question would it have made any difference.

1. Check the 'Castello Sforzesco', it's a huge castle right in the center of the city, walking distance from Duomo.
It has several museums inside.
The 'Navigli' area at night is worth checking, lots of people, bars and nice atmosphere.

2. Avoid the center when you eat. Overpriced tourist traps.
If you have never tried real italian pizza go to 'Solo Pizza', viale Premuda 13. Best pizza in the city, awful looking place but it's worth it, I promise. Go!
For lunch go to Luini (it's a bakery) in the center and grab a 'panzerotto', you won't regret it.


3. [This](http://www.cenacolovinciano.net) is the official way to buy tickets.
Last time I got them for a friend that was visiting, it was completely booked for weeks, hope you guys have more luck :)

4. Expensive italian shopping: Via della Spiga e Via Montenapoleone. All the area around there is uber expensive with the most important fashion brands having their main stores here.

The pretexts involved are something along the lines of: giving away the countries natural resources, the distribution gov. funds favoring counties and towns controlled by the people in power and the fact that the government was ""coerced"" to create the Hungarian medical faculty at Tg. Mures.

Concerning the faculty what they actually protested against was the fact that the Hungarian party acted like a swing vote and could blackmail the government into doing one thing ore another. This is somewhat absurd to protest now because they've played this part for the last 20+ years because they've always had roughly 6% in every election and used to always position themselves on the side that's in power (a valid approach I would say but but every now and then someone will have something to say about it...usually when they're working with the other side). 

As for the creation of the faculty itself it's not exactly the best idea in a way because: 

* it requires new faculty members

* schooling would be only in Hungarian and this wouldn't really allow them to do much elsewhere in the country if everything else is in Romanian
* there already are programs in both languages just that they're a bit spread out across the universities current faculties

So 10 years there were a lot of trouble the officials, about the details of the law. The main Topic was the storage of weapons and the inspection of it (Keyword: Verdachtsunabhänige Kontrolle vs. Unverletzlichkeit der Wohnung §13 GG) but also the difference between ""tragen"" und ""führen"" of weapons.

Another thing is, that there had been a lot of very bad and populistic ideas about the new law (e.g. central gun storage, ban of ""large"" caliber). So there is an unsureness on the side of the gun owners.

At last there are some intentions to make money with the gun owner. (e.g. a few weeks ago, Bremen discussed a gun tax)

Make sure you find a place to stay as soon as possible. Landlords in Germany won't be lucky giving room to three students without job (and cash). Renting a place usually requires a deposit - no money, no room.

Where do you plan to work? Usually German companies won't just hire somebody who's just here for 12 month and doesn't speak the local language. So all chances I see is some kind of internship - and that's usually paid lousy. You can't make a living from this money. Don't expect do find a job in bartending, serving or retail - if you don't speak German no one will hire you because you won't be able to communicate with the customer. (Don't expect the customer to speak English.)

Statistiquement, il a été prouvé que l'électorat FN est très homogène, et comporte nombre de jeunes.
Ce ne sont pas ""des nazis et des vieux"", pour caricaturer ce qui est dit ici, ce sont simplement des gens qui font de la lutte l'immigration et la sécurité leur priorité numéro un, souvent parce que la ville où ils vivent devient dangereuse. Les élections de 2007 l'ont prouvé, quand Sarkozy a prétendu qu'il règlerait ces problèmes, le score du FN a été minable.
Depuis, une partie de cet électorat décu s'est tourné vers le FN.
Il y a également pas mal de gens , meme de gauche, qui changent de bord suite à de mauvaises expérience avec les étrangers (ou plus exactement disons le clairement,  les africains). Sur ce point je pense que le tabou total (la moindre critique  étant forcément assimilé a du racisme, ce qui est totalement idiot) n'aide personne, a part justement le FN. Il y a réellement un problème, et je trouve complètement fou ne pas en parler. C'est l'éléphant dans la pièce que personne ne veut voir.

Personnellement je n'ai absolument pas été surpris par ce score (ou par les sondages, auparavant). Je trouve toujours que mon ex-candidat, mr Bayrou, est le plus honnête et le plus raisonnable, mais tout comme Sarkozy et Hollande il marche sur la pointe des pieds sur ces sujets (immigration / sécurité).

Donc pour répondre a ta question : Je ne peux pas parler a la place des frontistes, mais principalement je pense qu'il s'agit simplement de personnes pour lesquelles l'immigration et l'insécurité sont devenu la priorité numéro 1. Le rejet de la mondialisation joue également un role important. Je ne pense pas que la société ait changée, mais plutôt que des problèmes existants sont devenus prioritaires à force de ne pas être abordés sainement.
Contrairement aux clichés qu'on lit ici, je pense pas qu'ils s'agissent de vieux a la campagne. Je viens de la campagne et je vis à l'étranger á présent, c'est plus facile de faire un vote ""raisonnable"" (pour moi Bayrou) quand on vit comfortablement dans un village tranquille, que quand on vit a Paris ou Evry et qu'on (soi-meme, sa copine, amis, famille) se fait aggressé régulièrement, physiquement et verbalement. 

Anecdote marrante : Je connais un arabe qui vote FN ! Quand je lui ai demandé s'il était sérieux, il m'a dit ""Non mais t'as vu Marseille ? Moi je suis ici pour la France, pas pour retourner au bled !"" et ""Les barbus nous envahissent"" (il est musulman trés modéré).

The rights to the book belong to the Free State of Bavaria (because he was registered there and after the war the Allies gave his possessions to the State). Possessing the book is legal and so is selling or buying antiquarian copies. Forbidden are pirated or edited copies (both rules not different than any other book, song or movie).

As in any normal state hate speech propaganda and incitement of the masses is forbidden (""killing people"" CANNOT BE PART OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH), and because this is the essence of the book - the original copy without commentary and with all the graphic depictions (Swastikas) is illegal.

The rights to the book belong to the Free State of Bavaria (because he was registered there and after the war the Allies gave his possessions to the State). Possessing the book is legal and so is selling or buying antiquarian copies. Forbidden are pirated or edited copies (both rules not different than any other book, song or movie).

As in any normal state hate speech propaganda and incitement of the masses is forbidden (""killing people"" CANNOT BE PART OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH), and because this is the essence of the book - the original copy without commentary and with all the graphic depictions (Swastikas) is illegal.

Restricting what you can legally own does very little to curb what weapons are used by criminal gangs and the like. Nearly all (about 85% IIRC from an American study) of guns used in attacks on people were purchased illegally on the black market. Those people who register their guns and follow the law do not wish to harm others. Those people who do wish to harm others don't care about the laws, and will get a gun whatever the laws say.

You should also visit the old [cotton mill](http://www.spinnerei.de/from-cotton-to-culture-en.html?lang=1) if you're into art, the giant complex nowadays houses galleries and artists. Of course you could take the tram, but the distance is walkable from the center and it's interesting to see how the city changes as you go along. You'll come across old factory buildings that have been transformed into modern lofts, and others that are slowly decaying because rents in Leipzig are still too low to justify that kind of investment (Leipzig is now growing again, but have a look at the population figures in [this graph](http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Leipzig_population.svg)).

Of course, there's also the [monument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_to_the_Battle_of_the_Nations), which offers a nice view from the top. 

Depending on when you'll be in Leipzig, here are a few events in the near future:

Saturday, May 5th: Bimbotown party in the old cotton mill mentioned above. Music, performances and general party with plenty of interactive machines by artist [Jim Whiting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Whiting). Here's a [random video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPNgFCyAhNA). Doors open at 9pm, the €14 entrance fee includes vouchers for drinks.

Sunday, May 6th: Prix de Tacot, the annual soap box race. Be there for the downhill, scheduled for 4:45pm, the other disciplines are boring. Position yourself somewhere along the track, which is on the Fockeberg, a [schuttberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuttberg) located [here](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Fockestra%C3%9Fe,+Leipzig,+Deutschland&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.318946,12.365842&amp;spn=0.016146,0.038538&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=41.767874,78.925781&amp;oq=leipzig+fockestra&amp;hnear=Fockestra%C3%9Fe,+Leipzig,+Sachsen,+Germany&amp;t=m&amp;z=15&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=51.318948,12.365836&amp;panoid=byYHw4BOxcrW-4Akg7Oq2Q&amp;cbp=12,256.91,,0,0.97).

Friday, May 25th through Monday, May 28th: [WGT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave-Gotik-Treffen), Twenty thousand goths will be all around the city for the annual meet-up.

true,diablo_man,null,null,"huh, apparently your system is vastly different from ours. why on earth would you require seperate licenses for each gun? Over here we have one license that shows you know safety procedures and that the police have checked and will continue to check your criminal record and mental health.
after that you are allowed to buy whatever guns your license allows. The registry had nothing to do with who is actually eligible for owning what guns.

I dont see the point of going for less accidents like that. One could just as easily make it so the average citizen cant own a car and then crow about how this lowered the accident rate. the trick is safety education, guns are quite safe if you follow a few simple handling rules, and will never discharge without human input.

why wouldnt hunters, farmers and target shooters be able to keep their guns in their own house? that makes no sense. I may be goign out on a limb here with regards to germany specifically, but every country ive looked at, legal gun owners are one of the most law abiding groups there is(committing less than a 1/4 as many homicides per capita as the general population in canada, CCW license holders in the states commiting less than 1/20th as many homicides etc), these are people who have passed numerous criminal checks that th average person hasnt, and put time and effort and money into following the rules and laws. These are not people who go buy a smuggled weapon from a drug dealer and then do drive by's. Given the numbers, you are statistically safer here in a room full of people with gun licenses, than in a room full of random people.

Any bid will be at least partly based on the price of the shares on the stock market so it's bound to be low.

- Camping: My recommendation would be Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. Its a relatively sparsely populated state and comes with cheap camping prices. If you're not obliged to the main season, a night on a camping site costs between 2,50 and 5€ (main season, maybe 5 to 6€). You might want to rent a canoe (If your dogs are fine with that ;-) ) and just paddle from camping site to camping site. I can almost guarantee that you're going to enjoy it. You can rent canoes at various places, so you travel to your starting point, bring a tent and go for it. The people I met there were all nice and helpful as well, so if you're camping and having any difficulties, dont hesitate to ask. Check out this [website](http://www.vcwmv.de/).

- Safety. Yep, camping is super safe. I don't have any particular statistics. Perhaps that already proves my point.

Consider, if steel was 10x cheaper then everyone would be buying a lot more stuff made out of it, so the demand is there but the supply is not - therefore demand has outgrown supply in steel also, but the prices are such that we don't run out of it overnight, as lower prices would just be bad business sense (and would also cause global chaos!)

You're right though that the prices would continue to rise either way as they do with all things, but that's the difference between ""increasing prices"", and ""rapidly increasing prices"" as I put it - my point is that they are going to start going up a lot faster, and by ridiculous amounts, to the point where in 20 years the average person will not be driving to work any more (assuming there is any jobs to go to in a post-oil economy!)

So slowing down the price hike you say - that's what we're doing with every other resource on the planet all the time anyway by discovering more of it and increasing production, we have a limited amount of iron, fresh water, bauxite, lithium, coal, etc.

But there's never enough supply for what is really desired by the market, however prices simply level naturally where people can't afford to buy it superfluously.

Anyway - my *actual* point was supposed to be that it's getting to a point where we can't sustain the current way the world works due to the way oil prices are about to go. And that is an immediate problem over the next couple of decades. Whereas if it was more like iron where we could still keep production to reasonable levels then it wouldn't cause such a global screw-up. It's the steepness of the price increase on oil that is going to cause the problem because while we *do* have other options available, they aren't going to be easy, and we need to start 50 years ago!

true,neohellpoet,CROA,Croatia,"I understand your point, it's cheap oil, steel, copper... that drives the economy not the resource it self and lower prices will make it available to more people and thus an infinitely low price will produce an infinitely high demand. Except that's not true, even if iron was free we would still run out of ways to use it, but would still use it significantly more often as we would start to replace other materials with iron and steel where ever it is possible.

Oil though, is in a somewhat unique situation. If you are a growing economic power, you can substitute steel and other materials for cheaper, more abundant alternatives, but oil is the cheap more abundant alternative. Higher oil consumption is a byproduct of industrialization and will remain as such until it's price pushes it in to second place or there's a total global economic collapse (I'm hoping for the former)

My essential point was that due to the fact that a) three very large countries (China, India and Brazil) are rapidly industrializing and b) the price of oil ,while high by historical comparison, is still not prohibitive and would thus continue to rise, even if supply constantly rose driven by a growing demand that has yet to be scared of by price.

It follows that even if we find massive new oil reserves and thus push peak oil back by many decades, we will still be confronted by the same problems we have because of peak oil since it's not about availability, it's about price (ex. you could actually put gold to good use were it not for the fact that it's over inflated price renders any use uneconomical)

Finding new oil fields is not so much a solution, as it is a release valve that gives us time to adapt our infrastructure for a post oil world. In order to get the general public on board with alternative energy they must be made aware of this. They must know that we really can't drill our selves out of this one.

For instance, I think most people would be shocked that the British government spends less on Medical Research (£500m) than on the free bus pass for the elderly (£700m). Or, up until recently, £30m on dementia research, £700m on the free bus pass, as against an estimated dementia burden on the NHS of over £20,000m.

This premise is incorrect - it only applies if there's also an infinite amount of iron, or at least enough iron to absolutely saturate all demand/need/want... this is of course not the case. We have less mine-able iron than would be desired. If it was free then we would basically use the entire lot in a week and that would be that, no more.

Also, this is wrong:

&gt; you can substitute steel and other materials for cheaper, more abundant alternatives

We don't really have a viable replacement for most iron stuff, and for that matter plastics too are going to become more troublesome with oil depletion, exacerbating the materials problem.

Oil is actually *easier* to replace than iron - we already have plenty of other completely viable ways to produce energy, and we can potentially replace all uses of oil (as fuel) in the world with existing technology. Just a matter of implementation.

However we don't have any viable replacement for all the uses of steel in the world. That is going to be a *far* bigger problem.

And before you suggest recycling I've already crunched the numbers before, demand for iron production is so much higher than iron thrown away that it would be almost insignificant!

Not sure if you got me totally wrong here, regarding finding new oil, etc. or if you're just saying this anyway - but I am not on this ""side"" of things anyway. I think it's stupid to rely on oil even a minute longer, we've already left it too late to start adapting, and the fact that today in 2012 we're still creating new oil based infrastructure is insane.

And believe it or not new knives and forks isn't where the real demand for steel is, haha - you know all those things you just mentioned? Commuting, transportation, industry, food, etc. It *all* relies on steel *far more* than any of it relies on oil! We can make cars run without oil, but we can't make them run without iron (or any of it's short lived replacement metals that won't last either), and to mention other resource depletion that will screw us more than oil too: we can't make electric cars run well without lithium (which is also going to run out by the turn of the next century btw).

\*Edit, to clarify: We can replace oil with renewable alternatives, but anything we replace steel with is going to run out in a matter of decades, even if we use other metals. Eg. imagine if we started using aluminium for everything we use steel for... all it would mean is bauxite production would go through the roof for a decade or too, then we'd be out of that too. Our actual physical resources are a FAR bigger problem than energy... if you think oil is going to be bad then just wait til we actually start running out of shit we can't do with out *at all*. And composite materials can't be used in place of metals for many purposes.

Just consider: We can potentially use renewables for 1000s of years to satisfy our energy needs. However we can dig shit out of the ground for maybe 1-200 more years until there is absolutely nothing left - no iron, no bauxite, no coal, even, by that point!

true,Snoron,EURO,"Sandy Lane, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, UK, EU, Earth","&gt; Steel can be made to last a long time, it can be recycled and a lot of metal components can be replaced by carbon fiber, possibly graphene and various composite materials. Not every component of course, but many can be replaced.

Problems: It's not certain or even likely that we'll ever be able to create these materials cheap enough/in enough quantity. We don't have the technology to replace steel with these things today, so it's kind of reckless to assume we'll be able to when steel runs out. That's not planning ahead, that's hoping for the best. As I said we can replace oil *with current technology* is we get off our arses and do it, but with steel that isn't the case. What happens in 40 years when we realise it's actually impossible and we have no steel left? There's no plan, there's no current visible way out of this predicament. With energy there is (as I keep saying :P) even though it will be difficult!

Also as I mentioned the amount of new steel we need makes the amount that we could reasonably recycle pale in insignificance - even if we recycled 100% of all waste steel, it would offset depletion by a few years at best. I've looked up the numbers on this before as I said (steel production against steel wasted &amp; recycled currently) and it doesn't seem likely.

&gt; Only if there's zero growth in consumption.

Well, growth affects everything evenly doesn't it - no matter what energy sources we use, the exact amount of time it can last us for will come down to that.

But consider this: Renewables are our only current long term choice either way. Nuclear power is not sustainable (although it makes a great stop-gap measure right now and I support that 100% as it stands) as uranium will not last. Thorium reactors will give us a few hundred years at least *if* we ever get them working well, but there's no guarantee of that. After that you're just going back to hoping for the best/sci-fi again!

Given that renewables has 3\* sources: The Sun, the Earth's core, and the moon's/sun's gravitational pull (tidal power) - these 3 things will last us sooo much longer than anything based on whatever random stuff we can dig out of the ground, it's the most sensible choice. Even with growth these things could potentially last us 10s of thousands of years combined.

I'm not sure what % of that is due to the earth's core, the sun, and other factors though.. but anyway it tends to be fairly destructive unfortunately)",0,1335714036,null,0,false,0,c4hz0c7,t3_swqn6,t1_c4hz0c7,t1_c4hywij,null,1428820128,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Problem is that these 7 billion people all aspire to a higher standard of living, and even if population stopped growing now (which it won't for another few billion at least), it would still not stop the economy and resource demand from growing.

Even things like fresh water supply are going to become a problem in the next few decades and one of the few solution for that (other than stop using so much damned water!) is desalination which requires a lot of energy and all that other good stuff.

Right now, yes. But over time that can be rectified.

Nor should we have to. Right now we're overconsuming everything beyond any rational measure of utility.

&gt;Unfortunately we have a further problem, that is the world economic model relies on growth and an influx of new resources.

That's true. Free market capitalism is great to drive growth, but that in itself is not sustainable.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"No country makes a profit off this crisis. Even a crisis like this can have effects that are, taken by themselves, gains, like the lower interest rates for Germany. But even if this crisis doesn't blow up, and even if all the bailout money will eventually get repaid, those comparatively small gains don't even begin to make up for losses due to lost exports. 60% of Germany's exports go to other EU countries. You can imagine that demand for industrial machines and luxury cars is not what it could be right now -- after a stagnant 2008, German exports to other EU countries dropped by a staggering €122 billion in 2009.  
On top of that, politicians have to explain to voters why bailouts that nobody believes will ever be payed back in full are necessary after the bank bailouts in the years before, and at a time when the internal West-&gt;East transfers are flaring up again as a domestic political issue at that.

And Germany is still one of the countries that are relatively well off. On that table where the negotiations take place, you have representatives from countries like Portugal and Ireland that, depending on which round of negotiations we're talking of, either have to go through similar negotiations themselves or can at least foresee that they will be next. You have countries like Spain or Italy, who are even more desperate to prevent contagion than others, and who have to pay significantly more interest on the loans they provide to Greece than what Greece pays them as interest in return, still under the very optimistic assumption that those loans will get payed back. You even have countries that have a lower standard of living than Greece and are still expected to pay, and plenty of others that have high debt levels and are in a recession themselves.  
As a whole, this is a group of countries that can rarely agree on anything even during the best of times, and now you want me to believe they just sit there and watch a game of ""what's in it for me?"" unfold, under the eyes of the ECB and the IMF's representatives from various non-European countries, when some extremely difficult negotiations have to be concluded within an extremely short time, without at least one of them blowing up in front of the press?

We even have, on the record, a great example of the opposite taking place. I'm sure you know that a lot of Greek debt was owned by German banks. What you may not know is that the largest share is/was held by state-owned FMS, the ""bad bank"" set up in the process of the bailout of now infamous HypoReal. And yet, Merkel had insisted on the banks taking a ""hair cut"" pretty much from day one. Losses due to the Greek default for FMS alone amount to €8.9 billion -- that's almost a tenth of the total amount of the default, and it's coming directly out of the German government's budget.",0,1335721308,null,0,false,0,c4i0644,t3_swgn5,t1_c4i0644,t1_c4hyd3z,null,1428820677,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

You would have to hope so really, as the only alternative is that it's in it's final stage, and that there isn't another stage after this one.

Probably not the case with you but I see a lot of people fall into this magical thinking where they assume there's some plan or design to anything, as if the narrative always has another part. It doesn't have to, though, there's no precedent for what's about to happen to us over the next 50 years - this global resource decline has never happened before and it's really quite unpredictable with regards to what will happen. People also rely on scientific progress but it's a fallacy and appealing to continuity - just because scientists have managed to increase crop yields and all the other amazing stuff, it's not likely that it will go on. In fact our progress is in many areas slowing now as we hit physical limits and it would require real breakthroughs (which may not even exist) to go further.

But as for what will happen next...

Maybe those with power will slowly increase it as they feel threatened, maybe they will use guns to beat us 7 billion into submission while we live in poverty (kind of how the precedent for our race has been set, unfortunately).

Maybe we'll reach an enlightened stage when the majority realises and is vocal of what you and me (and quite a lot of people) already understand about growth and sustainability.

But what sucks is that you can't talk about this stuff in the public forum today. It's not that people won't listen. They'll even believe you. But politics, man... you *cannot* suggest zero or negative growth in politics. No one wants to hear it, you can't say the things that are in our collective best interest because everyone wants politicians to tell us how things will improve, how they will improve them, how they will make us richer and happier and all the rest of it through their policies.

A politician with some intelligence and principles would get up and offer policies like: no more than one offspring per person, zero growth, etc...

Sarkozy ne s'est jamais présenté comme le président de la dette, et sa suppression ne faisait pas partie de son programme initial. C'est Fillon qui a introduit l'idée, et c'est la crise financière de 2008 qui a forcé le gouvernement à prendre la question au sérieux (car les rentrées fiscales diminuaient fortement). La dette ne s'est pas multipliée par 10, elle est passée de 64 à 85% du PIB, ce qui est déjà assez mauvais. L'autre conséquence de cette crise c'est l'effondrement du système de retraites par répartition, face à la baisse des recettes, ce qui a forcé le gouvernement à précipiter la réforme des retraites.

Contrairement à ce que vous affirmez, l'argent prêté aux banques sous Sarkozy a été rendu intégralement, avec des intérêts.

On tolère beaucoup, beaucoup trop de choses. Le nombre d'aggressions physiques ou verbales dont j'ai été témoin ou meme parfois victime est hallucinant.  
Et c'est pas un phénomène de grande ville : J'ai vécu a Londres 1 an et demi, j'ai jamais vu le DIXIEME des embrouilles que j'aurais vu a Paris sur la meme période. Je ne parle meme pas de Tokyo où j'ai vécu 6 mois, où de la Norvège où je réside.  
Et a écouter à peu près tout les étrangers qui me parlent de Paris ou de la France, je peux vous dire que ca les choque le niveau d'insécurité.   
Moi j'ai jamais vu autant d'emmerdes ailleurs. Jamais vu non plus ces trains où il est dangereux de sortir un téléphone portable ou encore pire, un laptop.  
Va donc prendre le train pour Trappes (là où mon ex habitait) : Je me rappelle quand le PS nous gonflait en 2002 avec le ""sentiment d'insécurité"", y'avait des gars qui se faisait défoncés pour un téléphone, des nanas qui se faisait tripoté et personne ne pouvait rien faire (dizaine de racailles, que faire ? ),la sonnerie d'alarme retentissait en permanence et bloquait le train, etc ...  
Je porte pas Sarkozy dans mon coeur (je suis un Bayrouiste convaincu) mais quand il a été premier ministre la situation a changée sur cette ligne. Y'avait des flics tout le temps ( pendant 2 ans en tout cas ).  
Je pardonnerais *jamais* au PS d'avoir sorti cette lubie de ""sentiment d'insécurité"" , que l'on retrouve repris ici et là : C'est sûr que quand t'as trois logements et beaucoup de fric, comme madame Royal ou mr Hollande qui sortaient ces jolies paroles, ben tu dois pas avoir a faire à ce genre de problèmes.  

Moi je trouve bidon de nier le problème de l'insécurité sous prétexte que ca fait des voix au FN, faudrait au contraire prendre ca en main.

Realizing that what has been going on the past few years is NOT WORKING, accepting that fact, and trying something else, is admirable leadership.

The ECB has leaked documents out the ass showing that they don't believe austerity works either.

Remember that the EU is not some entity out there - it is the expression of Europe.  France is a BIG, BIG part of it.  If France, as part of the EU, wants the EU to be different than it is today, that can very well happen.  The way to make it happen is to build support amongst the other parts of the EU.  That support will be easy to find.

These were in place way before Spain had its own public network of services.

Spain would need to invest a lot of money to be able to provide all these services themselves (there are not enough public schools, homes for the elderly or hospitals because the government always counted on using the catholic ones), and there are contracts in place in order to grant public and universal access to these services (i.e. an atheist or a muslim could go to a catholic hospital), and that's why the government doesn't cut here. When money is tight you can cut on your own expenses, but you can't cut what you pay to your providers.

Fun fact, people talk a lot about not crossing the ""catholic church"" option in the income tax declaration every year (so 0,7% of your tax goes there), and crossing the ""other entities of social interest"" option. In fact, the #1 receiver of money in that second option is the Spanish Red Cross, and the #2 is Caritas, a catholic church institution for helping the poor. There are plenty of ONGs helping the poor in other countries, but I'd say Caritas it's almost the only one helping the locals (or at least the most important one).

ogni specie al mondo mette davanti a tutto la propria sopravvivenza; i gatti (dato che siamo su reddit), per sopravvivere non si fanno scrupoli ad uccidere topi ed uccelli, nè si chiedono se sia più importante la vita di un gatto o di un topo.

lo scopo delle ricerche è sperimentare farmaci che in futuro salveranno migliaia (milioni?) di persone. che metodi abbiamo? sperimentarli su esseri umani? sperimentarli al computer? testarli su sassi/aria/telefoni/biscotti? 

ora una domanda: un terrorista fondamentalista folle ti suona il campanello, in una mano ha una pistola, nell'altra un gatto in ottima salute ma brutto, dall'aria parecchio antipatica, diciamo tipo [questo](http://i.imgur.com/JdkZI.jpg). il terrorista ti chiede quindi se vuoi morire salvando l'animaletto, o se preferisci salvare la tua vita, ovviamente sacrificando il ""gatto"". certo, è una situazione surreale, ma è un folle, e devi scegliere, è molto più grosso di te, è un campione di arti marziali ed ha quel marchingegno in mano che potrebbe farti parecchio male (la pistola, non il mostro). cosa scegli?

ecco, questo significa che la TUA vita VALE più di quella di un animale. o forse tu ti riferivi alla vita dell'essere umano nel senso ""tutti gli esseri umani, tranne me, sia chiaro!""?

""dammi il tuo cane o tuo figlio!""

""preferisci che io uccida 10 beagle o che io violenti per 10 ore tua moglie?""

indubbiamente, la vita umana vale più di quella di un animale.

altro esempio: quando una zanzara ti sta pungendo, sono pronto a scommettere che istintivamente le tiri uno schiaffone probabilmente uccidendola. hai mai avuto rimorsi del tipo ""ma.. perchè il mio benessere dovrebbe valere più di una vita di un animale, dandomi il diritto ad uccidere un animale per non sentire una pizzicata?""? 

è vero, la zanzara non ha gli occhi dolci come quelli di un beagle, ma non è certo colpa sua, non si può scegliere con che occhi nascere.
