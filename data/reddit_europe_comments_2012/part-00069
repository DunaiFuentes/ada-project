Yeah I will keep the pronounciation of Maß in mind for my visit of the Oktoberfest that will happen hopefully someday. I was in Bavaria just once for some days, to watch a match of Bayern München there. We combined this with a camping trip. It was nice but we didn't see that much of munich.

true,int_0x80,FRNK,Franconia,"&gt; So much of Europe has high unemployment, and yet at the same time I'm reading about Poland hiring Chinese contractors to build their roads and Europe in general importing foreign immigrant labor.

Poland's law apparently required the government to hire the cheapest contractor, and they obviously got what they paid for.  It's a stupid law, but I assume that ""save the citizens money"" was what they were trying to achieve with it.

&gt; Why can't Europeans hire Europeans?

Labor laws in European countries usually require that.  In order to work in most occupations in Germany, for example, the employer needs to prove that they haven't been able to find a qualified EU citizen in order for a non-EU national to get a work permit.  The government recently changed the law for certain types of jobs, getting rid of that requirement, in order to promote a wage-dumping visa scheme (the ""Blue Card"") because employers aren't satisfied with the decade of stagnant wages we've had to put up with, and would rather find even cheaper foreigners.

But anyway, looking at the people in the article, it's difficult to imagine they would have an easier time finding work in a foreign country:

* Pepe de Uriarte, publicist - would a publicist who doesn't speak the local language or have contacts in the local media get far in another country?
* Pablo Vega Gonzalez, video-game tester - QA is a difficult job to do well, but it's still not a high-demand field.  He studied labor law and human resources in university, and neither of those are easily portable to non English/Spanish speaking countries with different laws.
* Wendy Atkinson Navarro, administrative assistant - I don't think this type of job is in-demand anywhere.  I live in an area with 4% unemployment, and the only administrative assistant I've known lost her job and it took her nearly a year to find another one.

I assume that many unemployed Spanish people simply aren't trained in occupations that are easily portable to other countries.  And outside of technology work, even the portable skills would require them to learn a new language, which can be quite a barrier.  Plus, moving can be very expensive and painful, particularly for people with families.

&gt;  So, the city is delaying the project while it looks for an American company to build the trains.

Houston is apparently buying from a US subsidiary of a Spanish company.  The US subsidiary is called ""CAF USA.""

I don't know for sure based on that article, but if CAF USA is a US subsidiary of a foreign corporation, that likely means the rail cars will be manufactured in the US, or at least some portion of the work will be done in the US.

I'll give you a summary of what is being said because I didn't watch it either so not sure what started this discussion.

The woman is saying something about Golden Dawn working with the police.

The Golden Dawn thug says that SYRIZA and the communist party (her party) has worked with the police and they admit it.

The woman says she doesn't care about SYRIZA, take it with them but regarding the communist party he's a liar.

He calls her a stinking communist.

She says I won't let you turn me into a soap (referring to the greek anti communist moto ""Το καλύτερο σαπούνι γίνεται από κομμούνι"" - Communists make the best soap)

The blonde woman asks him if he got a continuance (I think he had to go to court for something)

He says he did because of a clerical issue so what's her problem? He then says ~~to the communist woman~~ to the blonde, apparently, ""I'm dealing with those damned liars, its' a liar from your party that is dragging us to court"" (~~any greek who can suggest a better translation for ρουφιάνοι, liars doesn't seem strong enough~~ The_soft_parade uses ""snitches"" in his translation below, I agree)

He continues: You are talking about a personal matter here and I won't let you (I think he's referring to his court case)

The blonde says: Our problem is that this is an issue for democracy, it's the fact that there are people elected to the greek parliament who will take the country 500 years back.

At this he throws the water on her and yells at her that she's wrong. Papadakis (the old guy) tries to stop him and the Golden Dawn thug attacks the communist woman too but I'm not very clear on that, she's yelling something like ""Get the hell out"" I think he slapped her like 3 times D:

Kasidiaris: Rocky Balboa. Ex MP of Golden Dawn (yes for 2 days)

Kaneli: The lady that gets slapped. Multiple times MP of KKE (communist party of Greece)

Dourou: The lady that gets water thrown on her face. Ex MP of Syriza.



The ""note:"" parts are things I added in order to help you understand the context.


Dialogue

Kasidiaris: Are you talking to Golden Dawn about the policemen of 1910? Drop it, we're the only ones that have fought with them.

Kaneli: I am not talking in 2012 with German-tsoliades (note: see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evzones)).

Kasidiaris: Syriza says that MAT (note: riot police) shouldn't carry weapons. Don't talk about policemen to me.

Kaneli: Neither should you talk about KNAT (note: term used to describe the communists that patrol and protect the people during strikes from MAT and fascists). You didn't defend the democracy.

Kasidiaris: We're the only ones that opposed to this regime. When they asked Papariga (note: KKE's -communist party leader) if she co-operates with the police, instead of denouncing them as provocateurs she avoided discussing about it. Did you co-operate? Let's see the video shots.

Kaneli: Are you on your right mind? I don't deal with fascists.

Kasidiaris: You don't deal with fascists you old-communist (note: considered a derogatory term in Greek).

Dourou: Was the trial postponed?

Kasidiaris: Yes, because the time had passed. What's your problem that it got postponed? With the old-snitches? Where is the snitch from your party that dragged us to the courts? Mrs Dourou, you're referring to a private matter.

Dourou: Besides the financial crisis, there's also a crisis in Democracy. You know what the crisis in Democracy is? It is to have in the Greek parliament people that will set the country 500 years back.

Kasidiaris: Get lost! (note: inaccurate translation; just a mild curse word nothing too offensive) (note#2: throws a glass with water on her face) We're not setting the country 500 years back. Go to hell.

Kaneli: Get out of here.
//Kasidiaris proceeds to beat Kaneli. The end.

Au Japon, si on ne peux pas te recevoir, on te donne un rendez vous ou on te rapelle quand ta carte est faite. En France tu dois relancer vingt fois l'administration, et hors de question de prendre un rendez vous. 

Pourquoi est ce que le nombre de demandes de titres de séjour a explosé ? Mais simplement parce que leur durée est plus courte ! Il n'y a pas plus de personnes qui en demandent, mais chaque personne doit en faire bien plus ! Donc oui, mis à coté de la réduction dogmatique du nombre de fonctionnaires, ça ne pouvait que foirer. Et ce n'est pas le nombre d'étrangers qui est en cause.

Vous voulez comparer ? Tes 1.6% d'immigrés montent à quasimment 3% à Tokyo, où j'ai reçu un service exemplaire. Il y a en France 5.3% d'étrangers, mais si tu retires ceux de l'UE, qui n'ont pas besoin de tire de séjour, tu tombes à 3.6%. Donc les chiffres sont tout à fait comparables en l'occurence. Le fait que j'ai dû faire la queue à 4h du matin (ce qui est très pratique niveau transports en commun, mais les personnes arrivées avec le premier métro ont été refoulées) est dû uniquement à une mauvaise organisation Française et à un mépris affiché envers les étrangers.

Ce n'est pas de l'auto-flagellation, c'est une vérité, c'est une honte, qu'on va rapidement corriger j'espère.

Et crois le ou non, pour moi, Français, bosser en freelance au Japon est plus facile que bosser en freelance en France. Même si je n'ai rien à redire sur les procédure pour devenir auto-entrepreneur en France, qui sont simples et rapides, il faut savoir qu'au Japon, elles n'existent tout simplement pas ces procédures : t'as le droit de gagenr de l'argent, il faut juste déclarer tes revenus. Pas besoin d'un SIRET ou quoi que ce soit. Et pas de plafond de revenus.

It doesn't matter for the very simple reason both frameworks have theoretical ideological failsafes that can make you thrive. Both of those frameworks can in practice violate you and both of those frameworks can in practice elevate you.

The left can violate you by not working correctly and not giving you any chance to do something individually and succeed. 

The right can violate you by punishing weakness, even when that could not be helped.

Those are examples, there are many ways to look at it and give other examples.


If they work correctly:

The left can elevate you by creating an awesome society of cooperation.

The right can elevate you by rewarding real effort, and make you feel that you got what you worked for.

So in the end we still have to make ideological choices, and Syriza has made these choices just as DA did. And I think we live in a period where making these choices is more important then ever.

Pragmatism on the other hand is something completely different.

- Claiming that in Brussels people did not speak Dutch but dialects is a classic quip of the French speakers, which quite clearly is derived from their sense of cultural superiority and disdain for anything not-French. If the language of the people of Brussels can't be called Dutch, than their funny belgian romanesque dialect can't be called French either.
- Drawing attention to the extremist fringe (preferably the nazi one) is also a classic tactic to discredit anything that doesn't toe the party line of the status quo.

&gt;I don't think that religion was the MAIN reason for the Belgian uprising. Amongst other things I think that the population in large cities was fed up with heavy taxes and no real power in governance. It was mostly a ""bourgeois"" revolution which occurs after a not-so-good Opera

The Church distrusted protestant Holland, the nobility didn't want to see their power erode in a more centralized united Netherlands (they came from being a pretty autonomous, outlying part of the Habsburg empire). Also do not underestimate the signficant number of French immigrants in Liège, and the influence of France, who liked to see a neighbour state weakened and provided troop support at a critical moment.

&gt;there is less and less interest in the population to get to know their fellow belgian citizens.

I'd say there never was any interest from the French speaking part, the Flemish are just getting wise to the fact that Belgium is a very lopsided bargain.

&gt;Moreover Wallonia has an history of heavy-industry while Flanders relied more on textile and services

Currently, Flanders is the most industrialized of the regions. The left-right alignment is nothing fundamental, just a fleeting emanation of self-interest: the poorest region benefits most financially by more solidarity, and vice versa for the richest.

&gt;It is true that Wallonia is poorer than Flanders, but that wasn't always the case, it might still change with time (some people talk about the ""wallonization"" of Flanders).

It will take nothing short of an economic miracle (or disaster for Flanders) for Wallonia and Brussels to catch up in the next 20 years.

&gt;However It is not certain that Flanders will be economically viable by its own, the same for Wallonia and Brussels.

Flanders will be, the others... New Greece. Wallonia already gets structural funds right now (and has for decades), they are awarded regionally.

&gt;such as the non-nomination of democratically elected mayor,

Firstly, mayors in Flanders are not elected, but appointed by the municipality council. Secondly, they are considered members of the executive power and therefore can't decide whether to apply a law or how to interprete it. If you don't want to apply the law, you can't be a mayor... which makes sense, IMO.

&gt;the wooncode which only allow dutch-speaking people to live in their territories

The wooncode only concerns cheap appartments supplied by the municipality. Learning the language helps these people to find jobs, which they need. So it's perfectly avoidable.

&gt;the abandonment of the language census as an objective base for the language border

If only the census would have been objective...

&gt;the strict refusal to allow Wallonia and Brussels to have a territorial-link.

Why do we have to give Wallobrux their territorial link? Did we lose a war and do we have to make reparation payments? How on earth do they think they are *resolving* a conflict by demanding that the other party gives up territory? Keep in mind that that other party already has given up their demographic majority in parliament, pays billions per year, and has to make the effort to learn the other language to top it all off.",0,1339075339,null,0,1339077237,0,c4xfdvd,t3_unpnf,t1_c4xfdvd,t1_c4x3xg7,null,1429088290,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;We already have the Wallonia-Brussels Federation so it is institutionalized.

The Flemish community has exactly the same competences, so that doesn't really matter. As for Wallonia joining France, they know very well their finances are in shambles. So unless they manage to extort a large parting gift from Flanders (not unlikely), they'll be begging to join France in months. The German speaking region will most likely join Luxembourg: they have money, are pretty small, a similar language mix, and a shared border.

&gt;There have been some stuff done to facilitate learning of the language (""immersion"" etc).

The immersion in the south has been hugely blown out of proportion by their excellent propagandists. It concerns 1% of the schools. Meanwhile, Dutch isn't even compulsory to take in high school. In Flanders, it is compulsory from 10 years old. In addition, you can't graduate in Flanders without passing French. French speaking schools are much more (re)lax(ed) in that regard.

&gt;What's behind this is the political idea to maintain a strong ""flemish"" identity in their territory.

Hardly, it's maintaining a functioning community where communication is possible.

&gt;I think (that's a personnal opinion) Flemish people are really more attached to the territories: 

That must be why they make no territorial demands, but the French speakers do...

&gt;even though the majority of the population in Brussels periphery speaks French, they still consider that it is a flemish territory and that everything must be done in dutch.

Well, it *is* Flemish territory, as the French speakers agreed. They came to live there after it was declared Flemish, when everyone still spoke Flemish there. Nobody forced them to. The Flemish who move to Wallonia speak French too. The French who live in London don't get to be treated in French by the English administration either: the only requirement of Flanders is that people do their official business in the official language. People who settle down somewhere in another country, demand to be adressed in their own language and use their presence to support demands for annexation by the mother territory: that's colonization.

&gt;The wooncode was quite borderline when it comes to discrimination. 

Hardly. It only applied to social housing.

&gt;Moreover we have a ""linguistic border"" which is not accurate because it was based on a language census that is now forbidden (because it would disadvantage the flemish region).

Rather because the census takers would put informal pressure on people and ""interpreted"" their answers to get more French speakers.",0,1339077778,null,0,1339078258,0,c4xfszf,t3_unpnf,t1_c4xfszf,t1_c4x5ndk,null,1429088493,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,SK2P1,EURO,Brussels City Gangster,"&gt; Brussels was predominantly Dutch speaking until 1950

It is not anymore, thus the historical argument is irrelevant. Likewise the periphery of Brussels is getting more and more french-speaking (the ""french oil stain"") and Flemish people do not like that.

&gt;Claiming that in Brussels people did not speak Dutch but dialects is a classic quip of the French speakers, which quite clearly is derived from their sense of cultural superiority and disdain for anything not-French. If the language of the people of Brussels can't be called Dutch, than their funny belgian romanesque dialect can't be called French either. - 

Don't make me say what I did not. At that times there were various dialect in belgium french-speaking one and dutch-speaking one, nevertheless the uniformization of language occured earlier in the french part (probably thanks to the proximity with France). Furthermore French was the official language at the creation of the state and speaking Dutch was considered as ""vulgar"". I did not say that French was superior to Dutch, or that Flemishs can't communicate between each others, or whatsoever. I think there is still this ""cultural complex of inferiority"" in Flanders which lead to many pike toward the french-speaking community.

&gt; I'd say there never was any interest from the French speaking part, the Flemish are just getting wise to the fact that Belgium is a very lopsided bargain.

Yes, of course you'd say that. C'mon how could you even say that? Look at the number of wedding between the two communities, the numbers of workers from both side who emigrated. You are just generalizing a fact in order to prove your point. That's wrong.

&gt; It will take nothing short of an economic miracle (or disaster for Flanders) for Wallonia and Brussels to catch up in the next 20 years.

&gt; Flanders will be, the others... New Greece. Wallonia already gets structural funds right now (and has for decades), they are awarded regionally.

So you can tell the future? I'm sorry I can't. I have read several projection analysis the outcomes are always different. But you seem so sure of your economic strenght, I wish you good luck. (And this comparison with Greece, thank you It totally make my day!)

&gt; Firstly, mayors in Flanders are not elected, but appointed by the municipality council.

True that. And who do they appoint? The winner of the democratic election. Well not if he's french-speaking and sent the convocation in french. (which might not be congruent with flemish law but it's with federal ones).
And then to conclude with the territorial link: I wouldn't mind if there weren't any trouble concerning the division of the country. Now I can understand this claim, the setting of the language border was done with the language census (so were the municipalites with facilities), if it was done now, the frontier would not be the same. Why would you want Belgian speaking French to be treated equally wherever they are. Your land is ""imaginary"" the people living there are not. I truly believe in the principle of auto-determination as an important democratic principle.
This is the typical exemple of a Flemish person who has lost any hope for the future of its country and rather than trying to find constructive solution, you blame everything on Wallonia. In a fight, each part has its responsability and by reading you, Flanders doesn't seem to have any.

OK. Now let's do the math, shall we?

There have been three major nuclear power plant failures - Harrisburg 1979, Chernobyl 1986, Fukushima 2011. Mean time between nuclear power station failure events is 10 years, for a random one somewhere in the world.

That means, we have to insure 20 Billion USD per year - which is about 2,8 USD per person on this planet and year. Now let the insurance companies make a buck, then it's about 5 USD per person and year.

This is massively affordable. It becomes even more affordable if you break this down to some sort of ""insurance penny"", paid for each nuclear-created kilowatthour.

The number of nuclear power stations is irrelevant, for the failure of two or more NPPs at the same time is highly unlikely, as our data shows.

&gt; If the operators of nuclear power plants had to insure based on the actual risk nuclear power suddenly wouldn't be so affordable. 

Five bucks per year for nuclear insurance - or even fifty bucks more (considering the Third World would likely not be able to participate), instead of a massively higher electricity bill - I'm all in.

La population immigrée en France est plus grande qu'au Japon, c'est un fait. 
&gt; D'ailleurs au Japon, on ne peut pas avoir de double nationalité.

Pas tout à fait vrai : un enfant peut être binational jusqu'à 21 ans. Après il doit choisir. Mais en effet, c'est un des cotés très positifs de la France. Ceci dit :

&gt; tu ne peux pas dire que c'est mauvais.

Si, tout à fait, je maintiens que je compare deux choses comparable : l'accueil d'une proportion similaire d'étrangers dans une procédure similaire. En France c'est 5 heures d'attentes debout dans la rue la nuit sans protection avec plein de gens qui tentent de resquiller, une épreuve impossible pour les handicapés et les personnes âgées. Au Japon c'est au pire une demi heure d'attente aux horaires d'ouverture, assis, dans une salle moderne et conçue pour que tout le monde puisse y aller. Donc si, je maintiens que l'accueil en France est si mauvais qu'il s'agit d'un déni de droit. La préfecture ouvre à 9h. On y distribue alors des tickets d'attente. À 9h15 ceux pour la journée sont écoulés et on ferme le rideau de fer devant des gens qui attendent depuis 3h dans le froid. On dénie ainsi à ces gens un droit parce que la préfecture est mal organisée. 

Que les lois Françaises soient trop généreuses, c'est un débat qu'on peut avoir, mais les lois actuelles doivent être respectées par l'État. Aussi si un étranger a un dossier complet, il doit être en mesure de se régulariser sans camper à 4h du matin devant la préfecture.

Les Japonais ont fait des choix, et les respectent à la lettre. Les Français ont fait des lois, mais ont rajouté des circulaires contradictoires au dessus. 

&gt; Ils sont soignés gratuitement, ont droit aux allocations logement, au chômage, et on éduque leurs enfants gratuitement.

Si je paye mes impôts au Japon, j'ai le droit à tout ça aussi (à vérifier pour l'éducation mais il me semble que ça y est aussi). Il est vrai que leur système social est moins bon que le Français, mais il n'est pas plus réservé aux nationaux que le Français. Et cerise sur le gâteau : il me suffit de justifier de revenus relativement modestes pour obtenir le droit, année après année, avec une certitude que doivent envier bien des travailleurs étrangers en France, le renouvellement de la carte de résident.

You conveniently omit that there's a strong Flemish presence in Brussels (universities, parliament, cultural institutions, hundreds of thousands of Flemish live and work there). If Brussels is not Flemish, than most cities in Flanders proper aren't either.
Fact is, Brussels is not dominantly French speaking either. French speaking politicians like to mention the small percentage of Flemish who live in Brussels proper, but don't mention that most of the rest aren't native French either (EU, immigrants).

The problem is that many people can't think of sharing. They think hierarchically, and acknowledging that they are not dominant feels like submitting. In the Flemish view, their capital is a meeting place, where they can coexist with other people. They don't see it as a seat of power that rules over the territory.

&gt;Don't make me say what I did not.

I acknowledge that you didn't intend that. It's still an argument based on that notion, and it's strange that you bring it up, since you just considered the historical angle unimportant.

&gt;I think there is still this ""cultural complex of inferiority"" in Flanders which lead to many pike toward the french-speaking community.

I think it's the continued practice of that attitude by a minority of French speakers that piques them.

&gt;Look at the number of wedding between the two communities, the numbers of workers from both side who emigrated. 

AFAI could find, Flemish-Walloon marriages are 1% of Belgian marriages. Flemish-Dutch marriages and French-Walloon marriages are more frequent. Migration happened mainly from Flanders to Wallonia, where they did not receive any support for their Dutch and consequently were assimilated within a generation. Now that the economic prosperity has switched sides, the reverse doesn't happen. Walloons don't migrate to Flanders.
Personally, I live just as far from the Dutch as the Walloon border, and the number of Walloons I encounter in my daily life is 0; Dutch, dozens.

&gt;You are just generalizing a fact

- Politically: due to a number of safeguards, French speakers and Dutch speakers have about as much power. Consequently, 1 French vote counts for 1,5 Dutch votes (4 million vs. 6 million).
- Economically: billions of transferts from one region/community to the others, with various degrees of justification, 5 to 10% of GDP.
- Culturally: French speakers never have, and likely never will (judging by the dwindling number of Walloons who chose Dutch as second language), put in as much effort to get to know the other culturally. French speakers also use French media and sources predominantly, Flanders has much more varied sources.

&gt;So you can tell the future? 

Assume that the Flemish export would grow 1% each year, and the Wallon export 5% (that's a miracle). It would take 35 year before they would have caught up. That won't happen, so it will take longer.

&gt;(And this comparison with Greece, thank you It totally make my day!)

I'm sorry, do the math. Divide the debt/rent payments according to population, see what the GDP of Wallonia and/or Brussels can handle on its own. Defaulting would probably be the short pain.

&gt;True that. And who do they appoint? The winner of the democratic election.

They can appoint anyone they want, being elected is not a requirement, just like a minister. BDW didn't become PM either, most votes or not - there may be good reasons for that.

&gt;Well not if he's french-speaking and sent the convocation in french. (which might not be congruent with flemish law but it's with federal ones).

His personal language is irrelevant. According to all consulted courts and approved by a vote by both Flemish and French sp, he has to send the letters in the official language; if it's municipality with facilities, they can afterwards receive a letter in the facility language on demand.

&gt; And then to conclude with the territorial link: I wouldn't mind if there weren't any trouble concerning the division of the country.

How noble. It being to the advantage of the French speakers is of course purely coincidental.

&gt;Why would you want Belgian speaking French to be treated equally wherever they are.

They are being treated equally: they get the same rights and the same documents as everyone in that community. What they want is a special privilege, an exception to please them.

&gt;I truly believe in the principle of auto-determination as an important democratic principle.

Personal rights vs. territorial rights? Most French speakers do. But in practice, they can't or won't speak Dutch so it ends with French being spoken everywhere, resulting in the ""oil stain"" etc.

(Also, there was the opportunity to make Belgium a bilingual country around 1920. French speakers refused. Later on, they initiated the split of the bilingual parties into monolingual ones.)

&gt;This is the typical exemple of a Flemish person who has lost any hope for the future of its country 

You say that as if it's a bad thing. To me, a country is a tool. If it doesn't work, replace it.

&gt;rather than trying to find constructive solution, you blame everything on Wallonia.

Where did I blame Wallonia? I just described what usually happens in Belgium. I took pains to mention ""French speaking politicians"", since it's important to the machinations of the political class vs. the people, and there's a significant difference between Wallonia and Brussels as well. Wallonia is used by Brussels to enforce their point of view in Belgium, in many ways.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; You see, this is what I envy about the Germans. They we're doing fine before the crisis, they're doing very well during the crisis.

Germany actually wasn't doing so well when those reforms were made. That's why they've become necessary in the first place. :)

It does exemplify what I meant, though, even if it was in an exceptional an radical manner in this case. The disruptive event was of course the Reunification. The East had many of the same industries as the West, only as a planned economy. And plan they did -- Eisenhüttenstadt literally means ""iron smelter city"". You can imagine how most of those companies fared when they suddenly found themselves in direct competition with those in the West. This resulted in very high unemployment in the East, about ten percent higher than in the West (despite internal migration on a very large scale), double digits for Germany as a whole, even though *huge* amounts of money were dropped on the East. This, btw., is one of the reasons why Germans are skeptical about stimulus programs for economies with structural problems -- so far, we've spent some €1.5 *trillion* euros over twenty years, and East Germany's population is only about 16 million.  
For the existing system of how it used to work in the old West Germany, the strain of those huge unemployment figures on top of the transfer payments was just too much.

&gt; If I'm not clear in what I'm trying to say, I'll sum it up: Banks are investing in projects that the population of a certain country doesn't need and did not ask for. 

I've understood what you meant to say, but you're looking at the aggregate of many individual decisions. More than that, we're now looking at it retrospectively from a distance. People can make decisions that seem, or even actually are, rational from their individual perspective from within the phenomenon, but the aggregate behavior of the group is irrational on the whole. This is why markets need to be regulated.

For example, imagine you're in a large building when the fire alarm goes off. The perfectly normal behavior is then to head for the nearest exit. But you're not on your own, there will be hundreds heading for the nearest exit. It might not even be the nearest one, people don't have building plans in their heads and their instinct kicks in and they just go where they see everybody else heading for.  
When you get to the door, only so many can pass through it at a time, but in principle, there's more than enough time for everybody to get out. All they have to do is to stay calm and wait their turn. This seems simple enough, but all an individual sees from its perspective is that the person in front of them isn't moving forward. The obvious thing to do is to try to walk around this person, into the line that is moving. Since people stand very packed, they'll start to bump into each other, some might lose their balance and have to reach forward to the next person, who pushes onwards and so on. It's all just normal people heading for the exit and trying to keep their balance in a crowd. But they can't see that the old lady ahead of has fallen down and you're stopping to let her get back up, and you can't hold back dozens of people pushing you forward. This old lady will probably get trampled to death, and so will you if you fall down while you're stepping over her while getting pushed. I'm sure you've been in crowds before, now imagine their life (or their life savings) is on the line.  
What is rational for the group can even become irrational for the individual. Imagine you've made it to the door, but you're on the sides of the stream of people and heading for the wall next to it. It's bad for the aggregate if you push your way towards the middle, but you'll be the last to get out if you don't. Many actually get crushed against the walls next to the doors (amazingly, smartly placed columns have been shown to fix this -- take it as a metaphor for regulation).

Or take a classic bank run, even if you *know* that it's based on a false rumor, at least before the introduction of deposit guarantees, the rational thing to do was to withdraw all your savings anyway. If I had money on a Greek or Spanish account, I'd do the same, even if I was living in Greece or Spain. It would only be rational, even though the result of everybody doing it will be catastrophic.

Now, those are examples of panic scenarios, but it works the same in the other direction. I'll still stick with the crash first, because it's easier to explain. That colleague from my previous comment is acting rationally, as an individual. If housing prices drop, it makes sense to wait while prices keep moving downwards. There are many, many people who would normally buy a house right now, not to make a quick buck but to live and retire in it, who are delaying the purchase they would have made under normal circumstances. Which makes prices drop further, which makes them wait longer, and sets a downward spiral in motion. This is killing the housing market, and it's killing the banks. Through their individual rational behavior, they're making it worse for everybody, including themselves. If only they would do what's best for the aggregate and all get back into the market at the same time…  
It's the essentially what had happened before, only in reverse. Cheap credit meant that it made sense for more people to buy their own house, and increased demand lead to prices going up. Just a bit at first, but higher housing prices meant higher rents, which pushed more people over the threshold where paying off a cheap loan made more sense than paying rent. Now prices are raised a bit quicker, and the same mechanism that now keeps people from buying today kicked in, just the other way round -- if prices are raising, it's perfectly rational to buy a bit earlier than you normally would, because you'll have to pay more if you wait. It's like a fire that fuels itself with the air it sucks in. Some will understand the aggregate effect, but they all think they're smarter as the rest and will be able to sell in time before the peak and make a lot of money by then.

To finally get to your point (sorry for the WOT, btw.), banks are individuals, too. Well, somehow they're both, since they themselves consist of individuals who have to approve the individual credit applications. Both factors contribute.  
Within the bank, you have the individual account manager. Let's say you're a particularly smart one, and you recognize the point you've made, that supply exceeds demand. Do you stop approving credits because of that? The purchase does seem to make sense for the applicant, as an individual, she'd pay about the same for the loan as she would pay as rent, only that this way she'll eventually own the home. If she waits, prices go up further. She goes to another bank that happily gives her the loan she asked for. Worse, *much* worse, your colleagues are signing loans, they make revenue, it's their job to sign loans and if you don't, you'll lose it. Here's another interesting effect -- nobody's going to blame you for doing what everybody else does. Nobody is going to risk their job for the off chance to maybe get a recognition that they should they come across their former boss years later after their prediction has come true.  
So let's say you've got a particularly smart boss as well, and all the way up to the top, and you manage to convince them all. Now it's the bank, the individual, trying to act rationally and do… what? Increase interest rates because it recognizes the risk is higher than the market as the whole prices it? The effect is simple, customers go to a different bank. The next quarterly result is in the reds, and share holders replace the management with a less foresightful one that actually makes them money, or maybe with one that might see what's coming but is still happy to cash in on bonuses while they still can. This is rational behavior. They can understand the whole thing, but it makes more sense for them to play along and cash in than to try and act in the interest of the whole and be out of a job.  
You'd have to convince the shareholders. They just sell their shares, prices for the shares go down and new shareholders think this is a great buy. You go on to convince a large part of the market. Doesn't matter, money is good now, they think they'll be able to get out in time, especially now that they know what to watch. They'll hedge their investment and buy derivatives that will make them *a lot* of money once your prediction comes true. You still don't give up, and manage to convince the market as a whole. Well, congrats, the market has finally understood, as is painfully obvious.

I think for now, completing the projects at hand should be the goal - so creation of an economy roughly as integrated as it would be were it inside a single nation-state. 

And that has many facets, some well covered, some partially, but to give a mix of both - thing like free movement, cross-border use of pensions, healthcare, unemployment benefits, voting rights, full recognition of education and other profesional competencies, consumer protection laws, pharmaceutical and agricultural regulations, cross-border divorces will be a mess outside the new enhanced cooperation area; corporate law and taxation base calculation can work as an optional extraterritorial regime like now for the former and in near future for the latter, but are certainly crucial in some form for a corporation to be able to act in the territories within the EU comparably easly as if it were inside a single state etcetc I'm surely missing out a lot of stuff, particularly the difficult current issue of fiscal policy integration necessary for an integrated economy, w/o monstrously expanding the federal-lvl budget like most federations have.

Sometimes they issue whats called a consular passport which expires automaticly upon entering the country, im not sure if its true or not for spain. 

If you´re going to come to spain they passport and DNI can be made on the spot in many police stations but usualy you have to queue up very early in the morning (i had to go get in line at 3AM last time and i was 3rd).

In fact some were never technically immigrants at all, because France annexed Algeria and made some of its residents (those deemed ""meritorious"" Muslims) into citizens of the Republic. Since Algeria was a proper French département, citizens moving to metropolitan France were simply French citizens moving from one part of the Republic to another part, not immigrants.

It's not merely about preventing higher interest rates for Germany, it's about putting a price on policies of individual member states, instead of having mutualized debt for individual decisions. Introducing Eurobonds now would effectively prevent reforms. Tragedy of the Commons and all that.

We had a housing bubble which has created unemployment and banking problems, but we also had lots of sunken economy and a very small public debt (less than 30% of its GDP, when Germany had like 90%).

A big spending plan tailored to change the housing-based economy coupled with efforts to bring the sunken economy into the tax system would have solved the Spanish crisis. But the markets, knowing that, made a huge attack on Spain (and Italy), rendering them unable to borrow the money needed.

Five years into this crisis, Spain's debt has grown too much to accomplish this. The only solution is to ask Europe to stop the markets' attack. A normal debt price would allow Spain to slowly recover. But if the current situation continues, my country will be killed.

* First, it won't happen, because France and Britain like their freedom of action too much (see Cote D'Ivoire and Libya for France, and I don't need to give examples for Britain). Germany would never push hard for military union unless France was on board, for obvious historical reasons. But you might see smaller regional units forming, perhaps Benelux, Scandinavia and so on.

* Second, I personally don't want it to happen, because the national alignment of militaries is one of the aspects that reassures me about delegating other powers to Europe. It is a final assurance that the EU will, at least for the foreseeable future, be a conglomeration of sovereign nations, and it will not attempt to prevent secession should the people of one or more nations withdraw their consent. That is important because the European institutions are unproven, being both new and apparently unstable under stress. And, on top of that, there is a lack of a the sort of consistent public voice to keep those institutions in check.

I am coming round to the idea of banking union, though.

For example, Hungary is very secular, which this map states is the antonym of traditional. Hungarians are pretty big on conserving their own (folk) culture. Same thing with Japan, they have a unique culture that they don't want to lose, and have kept many of their traditional values. 

The way there are little bubbles over generalizes the different types of societies and the effect they have had on a culture. There have been  A LOT of protestant Hungarians historically (roughly 1/3 of the religious). Even the fact that they were put into the Catholic category with Greeks is weird. Most Hungarians are not at all the cross-wearing Maria-praising faithfuls like the Polish or Latin Americans. The Protestant reformation and counter-reformation wasn't as extreme in Hungary like in the rest of Europe due to the Ottoman overlords. A lot of German culture has seeped into Hungarian culture over the last few centuries, which is both Catholic and Protestant (something hardly worth splitting the country to put them into two different civilizations).

I did my visa stuff between 2002 and 2005, so the process may have changed since. All I had to do when I did mine was first, go to the einwohnermeldeamt and register as a resident of the town I was living in. After that, my wife (who is German) and I went to the local  auslanderbehörde with the sheet of paper from the einwohnermeldeamt proving that we were registered residents, our marriage certificate (we were married in Germany, so it didn't need to be translated. Your situation may differ), proof that she had income to support us (her previous 3 months pay statements), and our passports. I got a 1 year resident visa and had to go back the following year. The next year when I went back, I went alone. This time I had a job and spoke decent German. I took my work permit (this is no longer necessary, your resident visa now counts as your work permit) from the company I worked for and pay statements from the previous 3 months. This time, I was granted a 2 year visa since I showed steady employment and pretty good language skills. I went back again 2 years later with all of the same papers and got my permanent visa. I have since heard that at some point you may have to show proof of completing a German course, this may or may not be true. You may be exempt since your wife is German. It may even be waived if you go in and speak well enough.

That is, utterly strengthen parliament, put the executive (commission) under its control, establish the council as ""second house"" of the parliament. The EU would no longer be mostly confederation, but mostly federation.

Taking the FRG as example (which has a rather nice constitution), both houses would have largely distinct, though sometimes overlapping competencies: The council can agree to pass joint legislation on state matters, the parliament to pass joint legislation on Union matters. Both need to agree if legislation crosses that boundary, and again both need to agree when it comes to drawing that line, and the line between state matters that are legislatable by the council, and which are sovereign decisions of the states, states having naturally a veto when it comes to giving those up.

I don't see that happen even mid-term, though. Strengthening the parliament and have the Constitutional Court OK that it's democratic enough to decide fiscal matters is one thing, getting the Constitutional Court to subordinate itself to Europe is a whole another matter.

As a rule of thumb, I'd say we have a political union the day the FRG breaks up into individual states.

true,dhcoli,null,null,"I don't necessarily disagree with your response, but many American students (and parents and teachers) feel the opposite: that multiple choice tests are unfair and lead to lower grades.  Multiple choice questions, so the argument goes, are always 100% correct or 0% correct.  There is no partial credit.  So, even if you mostly understand the subject of a particular multiple choice question, you will still get 0% credit for an incorrect answer.  This is in stark contrast to written answers, where one can usually get partial credit for an answer that isn't fully correct.  Moreover, many people argue that multiple choice questions are doubly unfair because they often contain trick answers (if there were 3 obviously wrong answers and 1 obviously correct answer, the tests would be useless, wouldn't they?) or confusing answers (e.g. ""both A and B""/""none of the above"").  This is the reason that the SAT and GRE have introduced writing sections.

I don't have any evidence either way, so I'm reluctant to pick a side on this one.  As an educator, I see advantages and disadvantages to both methods.  However, I just wanted to point out that your argument doesn't clearly favor your conclusion that the German academic system is more difficult.

EDIT: Also, I think I should point out that your assumption that American university students are evaluated predominantly through multiple-choice tests is incorrect.  While it is true that many high-school-level (i.e. Gymnasium-level) tests are mostly or exclusively multiple choice, multiple-choice questions are much rarer at the university level.  If multiple choice questions are present on a real test (e.g. mid-term or end-of-term exam) at all, they usually do not make up the majority of the points on a test.  Could you imagine evaluating calculus students or organic chemistry students through a multiple-choice test?  

It IS true that bulk of standardized tests are multiple choice (out of necessity), but a standardized test isn't required to graduate from university.

Thus, your assertion that American university students are less well educated than German university students (and would therefore deserve lower grades in the German system) is certainly possible (although I feel that it is unlikely).  However, your argument supporting this assertion is thoroughly flawed.  If I were being rhetorical, I *could* indict the German education system for this failure, but this seems unfair since, in my experience, German university students are just as good as their American counterparts (and vice versa).",0,1339138807,null,0,1339141300,0,c4xt4cx,t3_ugiix,t1_c4xt4cx,t1_c4wy3gx,null,1429094830,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

true,Deusdies,EART,Earth,"1. As far as I am aware of, yes. There are minor differences (speed limit on freeways, in inhabited areas, etc.) Just be sure to observe the traffic signs.

2. Not that I'm aware of. I drove all over Europe and never had any problems, but you may want to wait for someone else to answer.

3. No, unless there's a green arrow pointing at the right (and it's lit). It looks something like [this](http://www.cbrd.co.uk/dictionary/img/filterarrow.gif) (note - this is from a UK website, this arrow will always be on the right side). IMPORTANT! This arrow does not give you the right of way like in the US. This arrow means the same as red light turn on the US - so let everyone go first, and then you. This arrow is usually there when there is a special lane for turning right (a separated/divided lane that is). But in 95% of cases the arrow will not be there so, no, you must not turn right on red.

4. [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_European_road_signs) has quite a bit of info on that. You will notice that the design of the signs differ slightly but they all have virtually the same meaning.

5. Yes; Europe doesn't have 4-way stops. If you encounter an intersection without traffic signs to determine who has the right of way, always let the one to your right pass first (the right hand rule). Also, often in the US when turning left and intersecting a 4 lane avenue in the opposite direction, you have a green left arrow indicating the right of way. Note that this is not the case in Europe - the left (or any) arrow simply means that you can turn left (or wherever it's pointing) - it does not necessarily mean that the people coming from the opposite direction have to stop. In that, and in any other case when turning left, you need to let the people coming from the opposite direction go before finishing your turn (again the same right hand rule). 

In Germany, there are rarely speed limits on the Autobahn. Therefore, it is very important to keep to your right and stay in the right lane. Left lane is used only for passing not only in Germany, but everywhere in Europe. In  some other countries (e.g. Serbia), there are speed limits on the Autoput, but they are rarely enforced. 

Be vigilant. American drivers are much more calm and they all seem to have the same pace (I drove all over the US too). European drivers are different, especially in Eastern Europe. They expect you to know how to drive.

The GPS nowadays should be programmed to tell you what the speed limits are and give you more info about each country, so it's a good to check that out.

true,cucurigu,null,null,"Most of your questions have been answered by the other posters so I'll just add a few things - you may know them but just to make sure:

- if you rent a car in one european country and use it only in that country you should be ok regarding highway payment but if you go into other countries sometimes you must buy a special pass for a few days or weeks - otherwise there is a fine to pay if stopped by the police. Either read before time or stop at the (ex) border passing and ask.

- european drivers are a lot more restless in their driving habits, especially in lower speed limit zones - so be careful and always check before changing lanes, directions etc

- near and in cities there are a lot of scouters and bikes which generally don't respect driving laws (driving between lanes, on the sidewalk, in incoming traffic and so on) so be careful when doing any maneuvers - always check in both side view mirrors

- in some (poorer) eastern european countries the police themselves may try to trip you up with made up law violations seeing you are not a local so you pay them a bribe (or ""fine"") - if you are ever stopped I suggest to always respectfully ask what is the law you have broken, for a translator if the police representatives don't speak (or speak unintelligible english) and a written fine.

- in some countries you should have a signalization triangle, a special emergency reflective jacket, first aid kit and even a change of light bulbs for your car - theoretically the police could stop and fine anyone that doesn't have them but considering you are renting it would be better to ask at the car rental company

- there are many automated traffic speed cameras - if you're renting the rental company would probably debit your card afterwards if you get a fine so I would be careful with the speed limit - even in Germany outside of the unlimited areas there are a lot of speed checks

In my experience the US drivers are a lot calmer - even New York seemed almost subdued when compared with Paris or Rome. Austria, Germany, Switzerland are pretty much ok (in Germany everybody is extremely disciplined), the french, belge and spanish drivers not so much and the italians, romanians, greek pretty unrully. However, european drivers also are better in small spaces with their cars so never be amazed to see just a few inches of space between your car and another

Dazu müsst ihr vorher ein kleines Drehbuch schreiben und die Spieler müssen dann entsprechend der Anweisungen handeln bzw. improvisieren. (Ähnlich wie bei Schillerstraße, nur stärker gelenkt)  Einer von euch muss dann noch die Anweisungen vorlesen.

Bsp:

Romeo und Julia spazieren durch den Park. *Braut und Bräutigam spielen, dass sie durch einen Park spazieren*

Plötzlich sagt Romeo zu Julia: *Hier ist es am Bräutigam zu improvisieren er sagt beispielsweise: Oh Julia ist es nicht ein schöner Tag...*

Darauf antwortet Julia: *Impro Braut: Ja, wenn es nur nicht so heiß wäre...*

Der fiese Tybalt (einer der Gäste), zufällig vorbeikommend, beobachtet die Szene von der Ferne und kann nicht fassen was er da sieht. Voller Zorn sagt er: *Impro Text*
Dann versteckt er sich in einem nahem Busch um mehr herauszufinden.

Und so weiter. 

* Ihr braucht dafür natürlich eine kleine Geschichte, es muss aber keine großartige sein. Hier könnte es einfach so weiter gehen, dass Romeo in einem Anflug wilder Romantik ihr einen Antrag machen möchte, Tybalt irgendwann voller Zorn aus seinem Busch springt, es zum Kampf kommt und er stirbt. 
* Nehmt bekannte Charaktäre. Das hilft allen Beteiligten, da sie in etwa wissen was von ihnen beim Spiel erwartet wird. 
* Adjektive eigenen sich hervorragend um die Spieler dazu zu bringen emotionaler zu spielen und können auch unterhaltsame Wendungen produzieren. Romeo improvisiert und sagt dabei irgendwas romantisches, während Julia z.B. im nächsten Satz empört reagieren soll. 
* Ihr könntet einen Running Gag einbauen, den ihr spontan einwerft. (Bsp: Jedesmal wenn Romeo etwas romantisches Sagen möchte werft ihr ein ""er muss heftig niesen"" als Regieanweisung ein.
* Gebt ihnen ruhig ein paar Requisiten.
* Macht es nicht zu lang. max. 10 min.
* Das funktioniert auch wunderbar mit untalentiertem ""Material"". ;)

1rst : lots of huge facilities (mall, louvres, Tuileries). To me it is the very heart of Paris.

3rd - 4rth : very ""bobo"" neighborhood, one of the oldest grid - used to be very poor district, with lots of small industries. Now lots of clothing stores and other hip shops. 

2nd - 9th : Lots of office headquarters, so pretty busy day and nights with professionals. 

5th and 6th are the latin corner, so old intellectual areas. The 5th has a scholarly spirits (lots of university), the 
6th more of a professional one (lots of publishing house for example). 

7th - 8th : half way between very expensive residential district and city center. Also lots of big ""public things"" (ministries, ambassy, école militaire...) The grid is already looser than in the 1rst to 6th arrondissements. 

10th-11th : recently or still in process of gentrification : arty and hip area, with still an air of old working class Paris.

12th-13th-14th-15th : middle class normal areas. Less touristy cause not that many ""interesting things"". The more west or the more toward center you go, the more bourgeois it gets. On the outskirts the buildings are often modern and ugly, lots of social housing, sometimes a bit ghetto. 

16th-17th : very residential and expensive areas. 

18th - 19th - 20th : The poorer areas, but in the process of gentrification. Some areas are pretty hip now, some other are very working class normal areas, and some are still pretty ghetto. 

That's what came to mind. Paris is a good example of how lots of european cities are organised. Center is the oldest part so it has lots of facilities and infrastructure, and is very dense. When you get further away buildings are more recent, it gets more residential, there are less facilities of regional scale. In Paris the specifity is that the east part is more working/middle-class, left wing, and the west part is upper-class, right wing...

Yes, but also just minor things and most ""irregularities"" are made even by signs.

Scientists observed a species of fish that can easily(within a generation) produce offspring of different scale colors and patterns. When there was a threat present (predators, decreased amount of food), the fish tended to be all the same. There was a low number of individual fish different from the average, so the deviation of appearances was lower.

With a prolonged absence of threats, newborn fish started to exhibit individual traits, scale color patterns etc.

This may be a very simple experiment but it does illustrate a principle rule in evolution: there is place for diversity when there is less danger. Times of strife are a test for this diversity. Diversity needs to be there before there is danger, in order to increase chances of survival.

Unifying around the most successful combination of traits is a way for a population to survive. 

I might not persuade you that it made sense to substitute ""unity"" with ""survival"". But if you would like to know where I took those ideas from, I highly recommend reading books written by Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen, a team of a mathematician and biologist. Maths and Biology are sort of polar opposites. Together, they take a very unusual perspective on life in general.
The book they wrote most relevant to this question might be ""The Collapse of Chaos"".

In France there is what we call ""priorité à droite"" (priority to the right), this means you MUST give priority to the road directly on your right, even if it's some sort of trail coming out of a forest on the side of the road for instance

I repeat, it is required by law that you give priority to drivers on your right at an intersection, and it will be expected for bicycles too

Sorry if I misunderstood you though 'cause you sounded quite sure about it, but I wanted to make it clear because France is pretty much in the middle of Western Europe so if you're going for a roadtrip you probably will drive there


edit: Roundabouts are a different matter though because the priority goes to people already in it, so basically your left yes

Some other points I think would be wise to be aware of that differ from the US (for UK&amp;IE just reverse left &amp; right):

* Always stay to the right. Pass on the left, but get back in the right lane after passing. If you dither around in the left lane on the motorway, you will have lights flashed and horns honked at you.

* The basic rule for right of way is that you must yield to traffic coming from your right. Signs, lights and manually directed traffic will override this, but if there is no other indication, yield to traffic coming from your right. [This sign](http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/145897/145897,1260547828,1/stock-photo-give-way-sign-right-of-way-42620782.jpg) means you have the right of way and every road intersecting with yours will have a yield or stop sign.

* Be vigilant. Driving style in Europe is much more active and you should always be aware of what's around you, so check mirrors and blind spot regularly and always before maneuvering. Don't be surprised to suddenly find a scooter or bicyclist in your blind spot (they will go pretty much everywhere there's room for them to go).

* Every country has a set of standard speed limits, which you will see on a [sign](http://www.slovakia.travel/data/Resources/Upload/Images_detail/Sluzby/Doprava/Autom/najvyssie-rychlosti_png.png) when entering. Usually, it will show the speed limit for urban areas, non-urban and [motorways](http://www.cumbriacrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/motorway-sign.gif). Sometimes there will be a separate speed limit for [expressways](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WGeITNDPjNM/TTwmMGzcTSI/AAAAAAAAAEI/JaaPPK0hlHE/s1600/Expressway.svg.png), which is a class of road in between regular roads and motorways. In Germany, the sign infamously looks like [this](http://www.worldofstock.com/slides/MES3913.jpg); the blue rectangle means *recommended speed limit* ([blue circle](http://www.cbrd.co.uk/international/portugal/img/05.jpg) would mean *minimum* speed).

* On the subject of motorways and expressways; it's important to be aware of the different *classes* of roads you'll find. Each class has its own speed limits and other rules. So, for example, if you encounter a sign like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Thorsager-Denmark-city-limit-sign.jpg/220px-Thorsager-Denmark-city-limit-sign.jpg), you'll be in an *urban area* which means the speed limit is whatever the urban area speed limit is in that jurisdiction (generally around 50), and when you see the [end of urban area sign](http://cdn.tradebit.org/usr/stock-photos/pub/9002/1106887.jpg), you're back to the general speed limit. Furthermore, on a motorway or expressway there are other speed limits and strict rules about stopping etc. If you don't see a motorway or expressway sign when entering the road, you *are not* on a motorway or expressway and the general speed limit applies unless signs state otherwise. These signs signal the beginning and end of various traffic rules that are usually not signaled otherwise.

* Roundabouts: You will encounter them, and will have to know how to navigate them. They're basically a road that goes in a circle, and most of the time, roads entering it will have to yield to traffic already on it (some exceptions, but they are very rare, just be vigilant). Just enter when the traffic allows it and exit where you want to go. On multilane roundabouts the general rule is: if going left or back where you came from (that is, an exit past 180 degrees), position yourself in the inner lane. It's common to use your left indicator to signal to other drivers the you're going more than halfway around. When you arrive at your exit you must of course use the right indicator to signal your movement out of the roundabout. If you're in the inner lane, make sure there's noone in the outer lane before making the turn (there shouldn't be if everyone follows the same rules, but you never know).",0,1339152244,null,0,false,0,c4xug94,t3_ur8qi,t1_c4xug94,t1_c4xtcuu,null,1429095535,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; Brussels is where we will actually be staying in. France will be in the beginning of August and then Munich, but I do want to visit Berlin.

So, what are the fixed approximate dates and locations you have so far? How long will you be staying? For two weeks, Brussels/Paris/Munich *and* Berlin means you're done planning. If you stay a month or longer, it makes sense to stop in a couple of smaller cities on the way.  
I take it you'll be arriving in Brussels. Are you planning to depart from there as well? Departing from a different location tends to be a bit more expensive, but usually it's still cheaper than it would be to make it back to your starting point -- unless you rent a car, returning it in a different country was tremendously expensive, last time I checked (although this was a *long* time ago).

You wrote that you're planning to rent a car, be aware that gas is close to $8/gallon. If you can, rent a diesel. Not only will you need less fuel, it costs about a dollar less per gallon. If your car loving SO still subscribes to any of the outdated prejudices about diesels that seem to be common in the US, tell him Audi won Le Mans with a diesel, and he'll love the torque. Btw., people here usually prefer a manual transmission, so make sure to reserve an automatic if you need one.  
While I'm at it, highways in socialist France are operated by a private corporation and cost tolls. If you opt for a detour via Switzerland, you'll need to buy a *vignette* if you want to drive on highways, €33. Austria has a cheaper ten day option. You can buy them at gas stations before the border. I can guess your SO is looking forward to the autobahn, so please, please, [read this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobahn#Traffic_laws_and_enforcement).

If you stay long enough, why not squeeze in a night or two in London? Brussels -&gt; London and London -&gt; Paris takes about two hours by train. Although, there seems to be some kind of sporting event in London around this time, so it might not be such a great idea after all.  
However, if you're quick, you could still score cheap (~€40) tickets for Brussels -&gt; Paris at the end of July [here](http://calendar.tgv-europe.com/en/?rfrr=accueil_body_pricecalendar). The downside of those cheap offers is that you have to book a fixed departure time well in advance. The same site should have at least some connections to Germany, but also [look here](http://www.bahn.de/i/view/USA/en/index.shtml). If you have the time, you could take a detour via Marseille. Both Paris and Marseille have TGV connections to Basel or Zurich in Switzerland (see the Swiss Alps!), and even direct connections to potential places to rent a car in Germany from. Frankfurt, obviously, but also Baden-Baden in the South, or Mannheim, which is near worth-visiting Heidelberg. Strasbourg is almost in Germany, also worth a visit, and you could easily take local public transport from there to rent the car across the border. Same with Basel, only that you could walk if you wanted to. If you visit Strasbourg, have some [tarte flambée](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarte_flamb%C3%A9e).

Btw., trains, as a tourist in a European city a car will be the opposite of flexible transport. You'll get lost, you'll have problems finding a space to park that won't cost an arm and a leg, and you'll always have to go back to it. Really, it'll only tie you down. Walk and buy day passes for public transport instead.

If you decide to go by car, on the French side near the German border, you'll pass over the [Maginot Line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line). I believe some of the fortresses offer tours in English. If that interests you, you'll also want to tour bunkers [in Berlin](http://berliner-unterwelten.de/home.1.1.html).

If you'll be coming from Paris and want to get to Munich more or less directly, afore mentioned Heidelberg is almost on the way. It's pretty, popular with tourists (Mark Twain's favorite German city), and almost directly on the way. Close to it is [this museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinsheim_Auto_%26_Technik_Museum). You could drive towards Munich via [Rothenburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothenburg_ob_der_Tauber) 

If you approach from further South, stop in Freiburg (visit [Vauban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vauban,_Freiburg) if you're into sustainable living). If you head North towards Heidelberg, stop in Russia's nouveau riche's popular getaway, Baden-Baden. It's been popular since the Romans, being on their side of [the Wall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limes_Germanicus). If you decide to visit Rothenburg (the crime museum there has cool torture instruments), there's a relevant [museum](http://www.museen-aalen.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=49535&amp;_bereich=46658) about it on the way to Munich.  
Or you might head East, through the Black Forest, over the Feldberg and past the amusingly named Titisee. You could also take the southernmost route along (Lake) Constance. 

Once you've made it to Munich, there's yet another [museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Museum). Plus some other stuff. I don't like Munich, but you probably will. On the way from there to Berlin, you might stop in Nuremberg (quickly) or Bamberg. Further North, Weimar might be worth the few kilometers extra -- a small town, but something like a [microcosm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar#History_and_Culture) of German history since the 18th century. Dessau is better if you're a fan of the Bauhaus, though. Closing in on Berlin, you'll pass Leipzig, which is nice and has another BMW plant you can visit. There's also a Porsche plant, and they have a track…  
From there, either go to Dresden or straight to Berlin.

If you have the time, Hamburg is great. The more direct route back to Brussels will take you through the [Ruhr metropolitan area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhr) and nearby Düsseldorf and Cologne.",0,1339152770,null,0,false,0,c4xuhrw,t3_uqpnu,t1_c4xuhrw,t1_c4xr80z,null,1429095549,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Also, although we had a denomination (we cut 4 zeros) in 2005 (i think) but a lot of people still use the value when talking about prices. So 100 (new) lei might be called ""a million"" and 1 leu is ""ten thousand"".

It also meant that it in a few years everything doubled. Being used to pay 20.000 Lire at a restaurant, it doesn't strike us anymore that the now 20€ bill is actually worth 40.000 Lire. So sad.

Also, the fact that we were used to very small banknotes (""When you go abroad you always come back with so many coins!) contributed to the devaluation, at least in our minds. The biggest coin we had was 500 Lire, worth 26 euro cents, and the smallest banknote was 1000 Lire, 52 cents, almost one tenth of a 5 euro note.

""It's just a coin"" we kept thinking. Except it's worth 8 times more than before.

&gt; To begin with, past virtue counts for little at the moment: if the euro collapses, then Germany will suffer hugely. The downgrading of some of its banks this week was a portent of that. Moreover, the undoubted mistakes in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, Spain and the other debtor countries have been compounded over the past three years by errors in Europe’s creditor countries. The overwhelming focus on austerity; the succession of half-baked rescue plans; the refusal to lay out a clear path for the fiscal and banking integration that is needed for the single currency to survive: these too are reasons why the euro is so close to catastrophe. And since Germany has largely determined this response, **most of the blame belongs in Berlin**.

That is; the blame for the focus on austerity and weak rescues without considering other options, which means that we are as near as we are to a euro-zone disaster, belongs in Berlin.

There are different processes for people who apply from outside and from within Germany.  Namely, the applications submitted via consulates in the US are handled by the Bundesverwaltungsamt in Cologne, and no translations of US documents are required.  My older sister and I live in Germany, though, and our applications will be handled (so says the woman at the citizenship office in Pankow) by the Ministerium für Inneres und Sport, and they won't accept any English documents, meaning all English-language documentation (back to my grandparents' naturalization certificates) will need to be translated by a certified translator.  I'm in the process of getting estimates, but my guess is it will be upwards of 500 euros in translations alone.  Or I could do an Abmeldung, go back to the US for a month, submit from there, and move back.

Sorry for the rant: major decisions need to be made!

For the record, there are many things that citizenship makes easier: working, health insurance, financing for my phd... (if I am a German Jew, suddenly financing!  Whereas an American Jew living in Germany?  Not so exciting to anyone).  For us it is also an emotional thing: Germany is our homeland, and we want to come back.  Not as visitors, but as citizens.  I also want my eventual-possible kids to have all the opportunities and securities that come with European citizenship.

&gt; In the aftermath of those repudiations, many states rewrote their constitutions to require year-by-year balanced budgets, something they had never done before. As noted, fiscal crises, like the one in Europe today, often produce political rearrangements—at best peaceful ones like these.

&gt; If the federal government had chosen to bail out the states a second time, it probably would have taken greater control over state taxes and revenues in order to prevent yet another bailout situation. Refusal to bail out the states was thus a pivot point in sustaining a federal system in the United States. It led the states to discipline themselves by rearranging their constitutions in ways designed to allow them to retain freedom and responsibility for taxing and spending within their borders.

&gt; Europeans today might be tempted to say ""yes"" to bailouts. Or they might also recall a time when Americans preserved their own federal system by saying ""no.""",0,1339164022,null,0,false,0,c4xvvnd,t3_uq4ut,t1_c4xvvnd,t1_c4xvpuc,null,1429096189,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
true,Eonir,SWED,Sweden,"Look - if you're so fond of your scientific way of thinking, then go do your own research. 

You dismiss those ""so-called scientists"", but that's how ichthyology works. Nothing idiotic about that kind of experiment. Being skeptic does not boil down to rejecting every opinion other than yours.
If you understand evolution a little more than what you see from cartoons, then you'll be inclined to accept the idea that some pattens propagate from simple organisms to the oh-so-proud mighty and complex human beings. Yes, our society is similar to groups of other kinds of animals.

To put it in layman's terms: in times of danger, societies unify. He who is different from others will be branded. This is basic tribal thinking, present in today's society despite our hubris. If there is a war between tribes, and your skin color is strange, or you don't dress up in your traditional colors, you look like a spy from the other village. Tribes have treated this extremely seriously for ages. To fit in the group you had to mutilate your own body. If your self-expression is incompatible with the accepted norm, some people will want to kill you.

What happened in America after 9/11? Every Muslim was immediately suspected of terrorism. Suddenly the entire USA behaves like a tribe. 

Compare a no-stress kindergarten to the military. Children will be brought up to be individualistic and non-conformist. In the military, not so much. You cannot be gay in the military. You have to shave your head. Everyone should stand in line. If you're different, others will gang up on you. That's how society works. You can try to sell me your politically correct slogans but I'm not buying them. 

Conservatives are always on about preserving traditions and pointing at those who are in any way different - be it sexual orientation, skin color, origin, religion, clothes.

Self-preservation is about working in the interest of the GROUP. Self-expression is only about the individual. If the group sees you as a potential danger, you will be excluded. That's why I try to say that conservatism, nationalism try to unify people under the slogans of the preservation of society/tradition. 

Trade unions want to preserve the rights of workers. Look at Solidarity - it was unanimous against their oppressor, the government.

It was already in the 13% before the IMF.

&gt;increased our taxes to the point of diminishing returns

We haven't had low taxes for ages.

&gt;enterprise and personal bankruptcies skyrocketed

No, there are companies closing just like everywhere, there's no skyrocket increase.

&gt;middle class has essentially vanished

No, it did not.

&gt;poverty levels are hitting new records everyday.

Link for our GDP growth in the last [3 years](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/chart.png?s=ptgdpqoq&amp;d1=20090601&amp;d2=20120630), [10 years](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/chart.png?s=ptgdpqoq&amp;d1=20020101&amp;d2=20120630) and [20 years](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/chart.png?s=ptgdpqoq&amp;d1=19920601&amp;d2=20120630). So no, no record levels of poverty. My grandparents would laugh at you and nag you with their childhood stories, when they were either almost starving or being drafted to fight in the war while nowadays we stay at home with all these luxuries complaining how bad things are.

&gt;Education and health are the most affected sectors with the biggest cuts

It was being cut before the IMF, ask Mr. Sócrates why he decided to spend way more than the country had for years.

&gt;social security is on the brink of bankruptcy due to the wave of unemployed and poor people in need for food and help

Ponzi schemes are hardly sustainable. And Social Security spends most of its money not on poor people or on the unemployed but on pensions, just because we're an old country. Sure, unemployment is also taking its toll, but it's not like suddenly unemployment skyrocketed because it hasn't, it's just growing steadily for so long, now we're worrying about it.

&gt;one of the biggest waves in emigration in our history

""Between 1886 and 1966, Portugal lost an estimated 2.6 million people to emigration, more than any West European country except Ireland.""

[Link](http://countrystudies.us/portugal/48.htm), so no, saying we're experiencing one of the biggest waves of emigration is laughable by our standards. Also, [net migration rate](http://www.migrationinformation.org/resources/portugal.cfm) of 3.23 migrants per 1000 population, so there are more people entering in Portugal than there are leaving.

&gt;mostly composed by our young and most educated, people that cost so much to educate and now are going to put their knowledge in use somewhere else.

Indeed, we need to promote employment otherwise our unemployment rate and young emigration might turn into a serious problem, more than it already is.

&gt;Corruption began the killing of our country

Corruption is still killing the country

&gt;austerity made the finishing move

Austerity is saving us from government overspending - it was the Socialist careless spending that got us to where we are now, mind you.

&gt;it will be long decades before we can recover.

Hopefully not.

Of course, English fell in with the wrong crowd and picked up a lot of French words, but German has plenty of Latin influence as well.

I *don't* mean to imply that Bavaria is particularly representative of Germany; in fact, the opposite is true. But the stereotypes about Germany are usually about Bavaria, and I find something particularly satisfying in sitting in a Biergarten under the Kastanien, drinking a Maß while people around you wear Lederhosen and eat pretzels. It's sort of like London; there might be other places in the UK where you can have a more unique and interesting experience, but if you want to go look at Buckingham Palace and hear people say ridiculous things like, ""You are currently in a Picadilly Line train in the direction of Cockfoster's,"" that's the place to go. It's just so quintessentially ""English,"" just like Bavaria is quintessentially ""German."" 

As far as Freiburg, I'm probably just partial because I live here. But there's a reason I came here, and that's because I like it better than pretty much anywhere else I've been. People say that people in Freiburg live in the lap of comfort. It's the warmest and sunniest city in Germany, and summer's a good time to be here. It's a student city, and an incredibly green city. It's just an awesome place. It's right on the edge of the Black Forest. It's a perfect mixture of a city that's big enough to have everything you need, and small enough that the Bächle still run along the streets and the inner-city is peppered with Gassen. It's just got a great feel to it. Highly recommended. 

As far as improving your German, just listen and try to immerse yourself in as much German as possible. Once you've got the basics down, I'm of the opinion that an hour of conversation over a beer is worth ten hours in a classroom going over rules. Just try to talk to as many Germans as possible, and actively listen for mistakes you've made and how Germans say it correctly.

That's not news, in fact, it would be worse in the long run if there hadn't been such an effort to cut back on careless public spending.

Fortunately now we aren't building football stadiums, highways and train tracks when we have plenty of those already, though we were very recently and if that hadn't stopped, things would have been even worse now.

&gt;So, are you saying that our VAT didn't increase 3%, that 50% of the Christmas subsidy wasn't cut, that 2 month wage of the civil servants for the next years wasn't cut, that savings didn't see a tax increase and that the personal income tax wasn't revised to increase the collection and that globally the tax collection decreased?

All true, part of the unfortunate cuts that have to be made so we can pay some of our debts and start living again within our own means. It's not pretty, sure, it's an hard choice, but the money has to come of somewhere. I'd rather have that than the default of the state alongside the much worse hardships we would have to face if that happened. As of now, life goes on, it's not easy but it's manageable, it would be much worse if suddenly there was no money at all to pay for everything.

&gt;If the companies were closing just like everywhere, than again, the unemployment rate would be leveled with everywhere, witch it isn't, right?

This unemployment is related to our uncompetitiveness and is made worse because of the unfavorable investment conditions. There's no easy answer but again, the government over-spending wasn't proving helpful in fighting unemployment and once our financial situation is stabilized again, investment here will be more attractive and employment can improve again.

&gt;even if our GDP was increasing that wouldn't mean that our poverty level was decreasing.

Sure, our Gini index isn't close to that of Germany or Denmark but it's not over 0.5 or anything, we're steadily in the 0.38 whereas these countries are around the 0.25 IIRC. I mean, it's quite an overstatement to say that the ""middle class has essentially vanished"", it clearly has not.

Yes it is, at least our kind of austerity increases corruption, in fact, it has increased corruption quite noticeably in Portugal:

""Portugal’s “parallel” economy has never been so large, representing 25% of the country’s GDP.

Increases in VAT and the unemployment rate may explain, to a large extent, why more and more Portuguese are either moonlighting in second jobs and receiving cash in hand or working and not informing the authorities about their earnings.

In 2010, Portugal’s black economy grew by 2.5% and is worth €42.7 billion, which the taxman is missing out on.

The figures were released by the Non-Registered Economy Index which was created by the Economy and Fraud Management Observatory (OBEGEF) based at Porto University’s Faculty of Economics.

In 2009, when the index was presented for the first time, the parallel economy represented 24.2% of the nation’s GDP.

One year later, in 2010, Portugal’s non-registered economy, as the black economy likes to call itself, grew by 2.5%, which pushed up the overall percentage to 24.8%.

In 2010 Portugal’s overall GDP stood at €172.7 billion, of which €42.7 billion represented under-the-table business which was not declared to the taxman.

According to the authors of the study, Óscar Afonso and Nuno Gonçalves, that figure is expected to jump up to around 25% this year.""

Lyon is probably in the same place. Downtown is ok and it's a big city so always something to do.

Marseille, I would not specifically recommend. Usually Aix en Provence is prefered to Marseille if you want to study in this specific region. But I hear it's quite expensive. Being in the south, it is very sunny/bright though.

Then you have all the medium-big cities : Lille, Bordeaux, Montpellier, Nantes, Strasbourg, Toulouse, Grenoble (and Aix). These have a good amount of students and the size/lifestyle will probably be similar. I think these cities probably offer the best environment for what you are looking for. They are very active but not too big so it's not as expensive as Paris.

I think Grenoble is usually the entryway to foreigners who need to learn French. I am not sure why, but I hear there are many foreigners there for the French language. For example my future sister-in-law studied there 1 or 2 years before going to the cuisine school she was aiming at.

I was staying outside Freiburg once, cycled into the town through part of the woods and had to cycle back out again very late at night, when it was pitch black. Couldn't see the hand in front of my face in the heart of the woods. Quite scary.

If you are down south, there's the Bavarian Alps - you can ride a cable car almost to the top of Germany's highest Alp, the Zugspitze. And there's *Der Bodensee*, Lake Constance, and over on the north-eastern shore, the town of Lindau. Nurnburg - Nuremburg -  is interesting too and they do excellent little sausages there.

Aachen, up in the top left, a natural stopping-off point if you're heading across from the West, is where Charlemagne's buried. Very interesting very old cathedral there.

I wonder if you could do a route something along the lines of :

_Aachen across to Cologne then down to Freiburg via Heidelburg, Freiburg across to France, to Orleans, down to Amboise (where Leonardo's buried and his old house is open to the public), back up to Paris via Orleans &amp; Chartres and back to Brussels?_

That sounds like a fantastic trip to me.

There's be lots to see. Perhaps you could expand on the German bit of that.

Incidentally, how's your French and German? The Germans tend to speak excellent English, except out East, and the French do too, though slightly less so and with less enthusiasm: but trying to speak a little German and French, no matter how badly, tends to go over very, very well - it's really appreciated.

Don't mind the Parisians. They hate everyone.

Oh by the way, as you're coming from America, you will love the food. The bread will probably be your biggest surprise, both the French and the Germans make terrific bread and unlike US bread *it isn't sweet*. French patisseries are sent from heaven, really, the shop displays are beautiful and the pastries delicious. Both do great coffee, though you don't get served the endless bucketfulls you get in the States. And German sausages really are excellent, and you must try them with sauerkraut.

Personally I'd suggest if you are stopped on a highway to put the reflective jacket, jump over the protective railing and then walk 30 - 50 m to depose the triangle. If you cannot completely get out of traffic (over the railing, ditch or any physical obstacle) then just put the triangle 5 - 10 meters before your car making sure no cars are coming.

Ah yes, and another thing : in some european countries if you run out of gas you and had to stop in the emergency lane you can get a fine - gas is considered your responsability and there are gas stations every 20 km or so.

Regarding the highway pass, as you said, Austria has one - and they usually check for it 500 m after the border passing.

With a tight schedule like this, I'd make it only two days in Brussels, then *take the train* to your four days in Paris. You really won't need, or want to pay for, a rental car that just sits parked somewhere during all this time, you'd almost certainly have to pay an exorbitant extra fee if you return it in another country, and you'd lose a lot of time getting it from the rental agency and on the road. Brussels to Paris only takes 1:20 hours or so by train, so you won't lose a whole day travelling. Same for your trip to Germany, book on Bahn.de, Paris to Heidelberg early in the morning, you'll have to switch trains in Mannheim. Spend the day you've saved in Brussels in Heidelberg, *then* rent a car and return it in Munich, or directly take Paris to Munich by train and save your autobahn experience for another leg of your trip. I'd cut Munich to only three days and throw in one a smaller city -- maybe Heidelberg or Freiburg on your way to Munich, or Bruges in Belgium on your way back. Make it two days in Munich if you want to visit Berlin.

There's one thing your SO almost certainly hasn't thought of: school vacations beginning or ending around those days in various states, including some of the larger ones. Beginning vacations will especially affect North-South and East-West directions, the other way round when they end, but even the other directions will have heavy traffic or might be jammed. Late July and early August is the worst possible time to get on the autobahn, especially before or on weekends. Here's an [overview](http://www.adac.de/_mmm/pdf/Staukalender_2012_93411.pdf) that highlights the most affected areas and dates, at the bottom of the first page is a vacation schedule by state. Not having a speed limit means nothing if you're just standing there bumper to bumper, it's the same experience you could have at home. Only, our population density is higher. Traffic is the reason why the various states have rolling vacation dates, and those jams can be *quite* long.

First, he opens up with a piano on stage, yep! A real acoustic grand piano, didn't really play it but it was really cool as a setup. Then after a big round of applause mixed with the sound of crazy teens yelling Danger Danger Danger, he shows up with his infamous costume! Simply Sick! 

The set is a Danger set, meaning he's only spinning his tunes, the video shows samples from his most famous track! When you think about it, some of them are like 5 to 10 years old, but still sound good to this day, I guess that's how you measure his timeless talent. The set is very eclectic, going from subtle funky distorted electro to hard banging saturated tunes. But the best part about Danger is definitely the transitions, they are epic: slow arpegiated synths, with big powerful chords, and impressive vintage moog-like effects! Which gives you an incredible amount of energy  even if you're not jumping like a rabbit in heat.

Regarding the sound, good news people, Danger will soon release an album. Yayyy! I would say 70% of the set is brand new tracks, and it feels great! Danger's been listening to a lot of dubstep, rock and hard electro stuff lately. But the great things about him is that even if the music evolves, his spirit and style stay intact! So even if you bounce your head up and down like a crazy stepper, no worries you'll still get the Danger effect! He's that good!

Justice - checked

Danger - checked

Daft Punk - ???

Here as well, but that sentence sounds odd, at least to me. You know, it's one of those things.

Oh, Galician. I'm sure you'll understand everything, if Portuguese and Spanish are look-alike, Portuguese and Galician and pretty much the same. Even in the name, it's Portugal, from Porto and Galicia, it's only a matter of time till we liberate you from the Spaniards! xD

Now a more serious question, do you there have substantial contact with Portuguese? I know a lot of people, specially here from the North, that actually really enjoy going up North and some even say you're better than those ""Moors"" in Lisbon! xP

There are a lot of universities in Bordeaux and its suburbs.  The suburb of Talence calls itself ""the student city"". The nightlife for college students was great!  Something was going on every night. Generally people around town are amazingly friendly even if they don't speak English (although many do), they will often use gestures or draw maps/pictures to help you out.

Para a maioria dos galegos o sotaque brasileiro é mais fácil que o *alfacinha* (bem, a pronúncia standard em Portugal) ou que muitos dos sotaques portugueses em realidade (exceto os do Norte, claro). O contacto depende muito de cada pessoa, muita gente não quer saber nada de português e até prefere falar espanhol com portugueses (e há portugueses que preferem assim antes do que se ter que esforçar um pouco). O problema dos falares galegos é 1) a diglossia e a influência do espanhol e 2) o absoluto desprestígio dos sotaques nortenhos (ex: pronúncia do b como v, e do ch como diferente do x, e muitas mais cousas). Dai que a gente do Norte pode lembrar ou reconhecer mais cousas nos sotaques, fonética e vocabulário (morfologia, etc..) galegos que os *mouros* :)

É triste mas para a maioria dos galegos o português é apenas mais uma língua estrangeira... próxima, quase familiar, mas de estranha ortografia que não devemos apreender e por isso o galego que apreendemos nas escolas (e o que temos na TV etc...) é como é. E como temos pouco contacto com as variedades portuguesas... ai estamos na mesma.

&gt;o alfacinha (bem, a pronúncia standard em Portugal)

O standard é o de Coimbra, sempre soa melhor que o alfacinha que muitas vezes vem com som a arrogância. Já agora, sabes porque é que se chamam aos lisboetas de alfacinhas e não, por exemplo, saladinhas? Porque não têm tomates! xD

&gt;O problema dos falares galegos é 1) a diglossia e a influência do espanhol

Aí não se aprende Português nas escolas? Nós cá em Portugal temos de aprender pelo menos duas línguas no ensino obrigatório, a primeira é sempre o inglês e a segunda costuma ser o francês (por causa da emigração que houve para França) mas há quem escolha o espanhol. Aí, especialmente na Galiza por causa da ligação a Portugal, pensava que deviam aprender Português..

&gt;2) o absoluto desprestígio dos sotaques nortenhos (ex: pronúncia do b como v, e do ch como diferente do x, e muitas mais cousas)

Isso também acontece aqui, e eu que sou de cá falo mesmo à Porto, normalmente sai ""b"" e não ""v"", e está também desprestigiado mas considerando que aqui falamos todos assim, que nunca é muito acentuado e como até os meus professores de faculdade falam assim, deixei de tentar corrigir. Os meus pais de vez em quando ainda gozam (eles não são daqui), mas que remédio, eu e os meus irmãos falamos assim, se eles não gostam, azar o deles.

&gt;Também os portugueses não sabem nada do que passa (e passou!) além Minho

Verdade, a nossa educação de história basicamente só fala nós e de quem cá esteve antes, eu já tinha acabado o 9º ano quando soube de Carlos I de Espanha, da Itália ou dos Países Baixos espanhóis, da unificação entre Castela e Aragão, da passagem de Ceuta para Espanha, de Gibraltar para o RU... não admira nada!

O mais triste é que têm razão, se nem nós fazemos um esforço quando a língua é tão semelhante, então eventualmente evoluem de forma separada até se tornarem diferentes..

&gt;Eu sei que me entenderias mas também pensarias que falo como um parolo ou em portunhol ou talvez as duas cousas.

Não, quer dizer, soaria estranho mas soa sempre estranho quando se tenta falar uma outra língua. Eu aqui escrevo perfeitamente bem inglês mas se tentasse ter um diálogo com um deles, certamente achariam estranho o sotaque, talvez se rissem. O mesmo quando nós tentamos pronunciar nomes espanhóis ou ao contrário, quando me chamam de Rosé em vez de José.

Make a plan, there is plenty to see, but it takes sometimes too long to find the special locations if you don't prepare yourself or have a local guide. Each of both cities is worth a three day trip at least. One or two days in Dresden would be sufficient (if you go to Dresden, visit the ""[Grüne Gewölbe](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnes_Gew%C3%B6lbe)"", the huge treasure chamber of the Saxxon Kings with all different kinds of amazing art and don't miss the [Frauenkirche](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frauenkirche_%28Dresden%29)).

Don't forget to visit the [Völkerschlachtdenkmal](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lkerschlachtdenkmal) in Leipzig. A visit to [Auerbachs Keller](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auerbachs_Keller) could be nice if you inform yourself about its historical roots.

In Munich (and Berlin?) you can book guided bike tours with English native speakers as guides, bikes are provided.

A very special experience in Berlin can be found [ here](http://berliner-unterwelten.de/). ([Wiki](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Unterwelten))

I don't think we'll have a say regardless, but there are plenty of countries in the EU who want to remain competitive with China (Sweden, Germany, just to name two), and that's just one example.

&gt; But in any case, I do see what you mean and I do see the benefits of an economic union. It's the political union I don't understand. If it is to reinforce the strength of our economic negotiating power, the same result can be achieved without a centralised power base.

There is no economic union without some sort of political union as well. As the events of the last 4 years have demonstrated so clearly, an economic union is unstable and basically useless without some form of political integration.

&gt; I don't agree with unity for the sake of unity. I don't see Europeans as anything more than my geographic neighbours.

As I mentioned, this is what we've been for the last two millennia, and that's what gotten us into *constant* wars since then. Really, I think some people have lost perspective here, because 70 years is a long time when you're born in the 80s, but historically the second world war is a blink of an eye away. But you only have to look to the 90s to find wars on the European continent.

&gt; They don't understand my culture and I don't understand theirs.

This statement is kind of ridiculous.

If you're British, practically everyone on the continent understands your culture. I was taught about the fucking London *tube stations* in my 4th grade English classes. About the Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park. About tea, biscuits, scones, stiff upper lip, posh celebrities, rude chavs and hooligans, and the separatists up north. British comedy is insanely popular in Scandinavia, precisely because we understand the culture and the humor. Also, we're having this conversation in what is most likely your native language. A brief look at your post history suggests that you may be Irish, but the story is the same — perhaps even more so, considering that ancient Norse and Celtic people share a very large amount of cultural customs.

You may not understand continental cultures, but I think that signifies two things: 1) Ignorance of your own culture and how it was impacted by continental cultures, and 2) a sort of willful ignorance that is somehow more prevalent among native anglophones (with the possible exception of Canadians and Australians). Your culture, political system, religion, customs, traditions — all of it originates in part in other places, mostly from continental Europe, due to geographical adjacency.

&gt; And that can never be true because self interest is always the first interest.

Tu verras par toi-même en arrivant les différences de culture et tu t'y adapteras ou tu ne les supporteras pas, mais tu verras bien une fois sur place.

Le simple fait d'essayer de parler Français et de vouloir qu'on te corrige prouve ta bonne volonté et devrait te donner beaucoup de crédit auprès de ta famille comme auprès des gens en général.

Juillet est par contre un mois de vacances et selon la région où tu seras tu risques de voir un peu de tout ou beaucoup de rien, ne te fie donc pas trop à l'image que tu auras de la France à ce moment là elle sera vraiment particulière à cette période.

Quand tu demandes ce que tu dois apporter, tu veux dire comme affaires ou comme cadeau ?

Si c'est comme cadeau, n'importe quel met ou alcool local de chez toi devrait faire l'affaire, ça dépend évidemment d'où tu viens.
