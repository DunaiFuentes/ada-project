To be honest, I don't see this happening -- sure, there's a worrying disconnect between popular support for further European integration (including political integration) and support by the political and financial leaders, but if I had to place a bet, I would say the crisis will probably speed up integration (at least budgetary and financial integration).

Like I said.. we'll finally find out what the truth is when a referendum is called and all of a sudden people start bricking it and start revealing the benefits of being in it.

The worst thing that can possibly happen to the UK right now is for the eurozone to federalize and the UK to go its own way, quite simply because the new 'EU' will replace the UK as being the entity to talk to around this part of the world.. Look around.. didn't Brazil just recently become a larger economy than the UK as well? I believe when it comes down to it, the UK will not allow itself to be marginalized in this way -- and Scotland may split apart to remain in the EU (That alone may cost the UK their UN Security Council seat.. and do you honestly think a federal europe won't be on the UN Security Council?).

IMO the only scenario in which the UK wins by sticking it to the EU is if the whole thing falls apart, whereas if they get the timing wrong, the consequences could be that they end up like Norway but without the oil (ie.. not in a good position, especially if their closest neighbour just split from them with all the oil) -- and when it comes down to it, London's patriots in the finance industry will likely move to Paris or Frankfurt. Oops... apparently only the numbers matter, who would have *thunk* that the finance world is all about money and profits? Who would wanna be based out of Europe's 5th or 6th largest economy which is not part of the federation -- and why not go to Switzerland if you wanna stay neutral -- much closer to all the german/french money action as well.. perhaps Ireland may even be better than London.. can chop a few milliseconds off market communications with New York if done right -- latency is very important in the financial markets :)",0,1339424294,null,0,1339425268,0,c4z315k,t3_uv5kl,t1_c4z315k,t1_c4z2x0e,null,1435709707,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

To get to Colleville-sur-Mer and the D-day beaches from Tours, your best bet is to make your way to Caen. From there, buses will take you to all the memorial and historical spots (see [this website](http://www.memorial-caen.fr/portailgb/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=815&amp;Itemid=1552)).

To get to Caen from Tours you can catch a train. Your best option in that case is to get the direct *Intercités* train (you won't have to change trains with this one) which will probably bring you to around 60€ for the round trip (see [this website](http://www.voyages-sncf.com/)). It's a 3h train ride (which is the fastest train trip on that route).

You also have the option of carpooling (see [this website](http://www.covoiturage.fr/)). I've personally never used it so I can't really make recommendations on it, but you should look into it. Car ride from Tours to Caen is approximatively 3h as well.

I hope this helps.

Look at how much money the EU takes from British coffers each year, money that could be spent on British projects but is instead spent on Europeans. Look at all the useless laws and regulations being forced upon us. Look at how Britain is unable to make trade agreements and is instead forced to partake in a German dominated trade agreement that effectively takes away British sovereignty. Look at how there's a room of unelected bureaucrats dictating everything to, supposedly, sovereign nations.

We only marginally avoided joining the Euro thanks to Brown, that would have been a catastrophe and you know it.

There are no benefits.

&gt;The worst thing that can possibly happen to the UK right now is for the eurozone to federalize and the UK to go its own way,

What would be the negative effect of leaving the EU?

&gt;quite simply because the new 'EU' will replace the UK as being the entity to talk to around this part of the world.

This is not really an argument that is going to win you support from any Eurosceptics. I couldn't care less what Europe does, but I am adamant Britain should play no part in it. Great Britain will remain an important global and regional power regardless of what Europe does.

&gt;Look around.. didn't Brazil just recently become a larger economy than the UK as well?

Yes, Britain should be looking to export more to the BRIC nations, but Europe is in the way.

&gt;I believe when it comes down to it, the UK will not allow itself to be marginalized in this way

Britain does have a proud military, economic and imperial history, but it also has a proud history of democracy, liberty and free trade. The EU is not a fan of the last three. Nothing can be done to stop the inevitable growth of foreign countries and thus Britain's decline, but giving up national sovereignty in favour of some European super-state is not the solution. Joining the EU will not regain Britain's super power status, it will not give us that sense of jingoistic British pride and it certainly won't make Britain more influential. In all likelihood it would do the opposite of all three.

&gt;and Scotland may split apart to remain in the EU (That alone may cost the UK their UN Security Council seat...

Scotland is not likely to vote in favour of independence, support was at 30% last time I checked. Even if it did there is no evidence that Britain would lose it's seat in the UNSC. I'm assuming you just pulled it out of your arse for the sake of this argument, you have no actual bases for this claim. The Russian Federation inherited the Soviet Union's membership, the People's Republic of China inherited the Republic of China's membership. Scotland will not be inheriting the United Kingdom's seat, it would be given to the new United Kingdom.

&gt;and do you honestly think a federal europe won't be on the UN Security Council?

No, you were the one who went off on this tangent in the first place. You had no substantial argument in favour of the EU so instead went for some ""argument"" (I use this word lightly) about how the EU will be powerful and thus Britain's only hope is to be annexed by them.

I have never believed that the Germans were somehow ""worse"" than other people - it was simply the unfortunate result of difficult economic conditions which, bit by bit, gave rise to far-right views, allowing in a leader who was a rhetorical genius, but with a terrible agenda. Getting ""revenge"" on innocent individuals for the crime of their country is no better than the German persecution of the Jews.

So, I would say that OP's article is very important to us because it reminds us that the war was not as simple as the Evil Germans vs The Good Allies (a view that is quite commonly portrayed in films, for example). ANY civilisation is capable of committing atrocities, and it is essential that people are aware of this, because if not, we could even start down the same path that Germany went, bit by bit, perhaps under difficult economic conditions, allowing policies that are more and more extreme, but of course it is fine for us, because WE have always been the Good Guys...",0,1339428784,null,0,1339429116,0,c4z3ypp,t3_uw4sx,t1_c4z3ypp,t1_c4z3aop,null,1429117473,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16

true,AlmightyBaloo,null,null,"&gt; I know French people have a certain dislike for Americans who expect them to know English, and I won't be fluent by any means, but I will try my best to get my messages across in your native language.

Well the important thing is *who expect them to know English*. I mean, most people in Paris do speak English (or at least fairly understand it) and won't mind switching to it -most will even appreciate the occasion to practice-.

It's just annoying to be adressed directly in English, I guess because it feels like tourists just assume that we must speak English, and I guess it conveys a sense of entitlement that French people really dislike.

Now that's a wild guess, cause I personally don't care as long as you're polite (opening with *excuse-me* and closing with *thank you* seems natural to me, not so much to some of the tourists I've helped finding their way in the city - I know parisian are supposed to be rude but *man* are tourists rude sometimes -).   

But just open with *Excuse-me/Hello*, [depending on the context] *do you speak English ?* and you'll be fine.

If you want to go the extra mile :    
Hello - Bonjour (from morning to the end of the afternoon) / bonsoir (from evening to dawn)  
Good bye / bye - Au revoir  (or simply *bye* also works) 
[Alt: *Bonne journée/soirée, au revoir* if you want to be extra polite :p]  
Excuse-me - Excusez-moi   
Sorry - Pardon  *[you'll need this one in the subway, it's French for : get out of the way]*      
Thank you - Merci   
Thank you very much - Merci beaucoup   
It's very nice (of you) - c'est très gentil   
You're welcome - de rien   
I'd like... - Je voudrais...  
Do you speak English - Est-ce que vous parlez Anglais ?  
*[Alt: Parlez-vous Anglais ? Vous parlez Anglais ? (interrogative tone for the last one) ]*

[Trick for asking question : just say the affirmative sentence (Vous parlez Anglais = You speak English) with an interrogative tone (Vous parlez Anglais ?). It's perfectly correct, so if you know a little French but get mixed up with *est-ce que* and the subject/verb inversion, that's the easy way to ask questions.]

How much ? - Combien ? / Combien ça coûte ?  
Where is/are - Où est/sont...   
I'm lost - Je suis perdu   
I'm looking for XX- Je cherche XX   
the subway - le métro     
the closest metro station / bus station - le métro le plus proche / l'arrêt de bus le plus proche.

Also do not use ""salut"" as ""hello"". That's way too colloquial. It's often translated as ""hi"", but I think it's misleading, because it's not shocking to enter a shop and go ""hi, I'd like..."", but you can't enter a French shop and say ""Salut, je voudrais..."". Well, you can, but then *tourist spotted*. It's not like you'll pass as a native anyway, I know, but still ;)
 
To get the pronunciation of all these words, just use [google translate](http://translate.google.com/). There's a button to make it read it out loud.

I feel like I covered the vital phrases. But only the first one are really important. In fact I think you'd better learn a little about French pronunciation instead of stuffing your head with sentences.   
Cause you'll feel a bit stupid when you'll ask : ""I'm looking for ""rue de oiqfhdfdjfk"" and the guy will stare at you helpless. Rest assured that the other guy will feel stupid too.

Do not feel compelled at all to speak French beside the *formules de politesse*, especially since you're not learning French (I believe you would have mentionned it otherwise) and are thus likely not to get understood at all. 
Except if it pleases you, then most French will humour you and try their best.

Btw, I read that Americans thought French were assholes [sic] because they skept to English immediatly when someone tried to speak French with them. Typical French arrogance, according to them.
If that happen to you, please don't take it badly. I've already done it, but the poor guy was obviously struggling and I thought he wasn't daring to skip to English (maybe because of all the preconceived ideas about Frenchmen and English...).

You mention the ""traditionnal American asshole"". Well the traditionnal American asshole is basically the American tourist meme.  
Be polite (yeah I know, duh, but that's not that obvious to a lot of people. French are rude you see, so I guess there's no point in being nice to them... God I love ranting :p) and respectful.   
 I'm not talking about the usual ""respectful of the French culture"" crap (I mean if you come to Paris, you must have at least a little interest in French culture in the first place) but also respectful of the city itself : how many times have I seen some family (American or not) eating in a park and then just leaving all their shit everywhere... 

But your move of coming to /r/France to ask shows me you're nice and you won't have any trouble in Paris or in Europe in general.
Well, that's about all I can think of at the moment. I didn't realize I was writing a novel, sorry !

I hope you enjoy your trip :)

I don't see how that equals to robbing? Even a rudimentary understanding of how the EU functions shows that being a net contributor ≠ 'being robbed'. You're looking at the budget and assuming that if a country is not a net recipient, they're being robbed. Frankly that speaks volumes about an incredibly simplistic view on the matter.

The UKIP is indeed becoming more popular, we're seeing similar trends in other nations that are experiencing economic downturn. It's no secret that harder times promote nationalism, and this is by no means an exception. I simply don't find it a compelling argument in the slightest. But in what form does the UKIP have more seats than Labour? Labour currently have 238 seats in parliament, and the UKIP have 2. Furthermore according to [UKpollingreport](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/) labour are projected to have the majority. So I do have to ask, in what universe does the UKIP have more seats than Labour? Perhaps I misunderstood your phrasing.

I realise that it is difficult to bring the benefits and drawbacks of the EU into numbers, as many of them are abstract, but what exactly are the burdens of the EU as opposed to the benefits? Do you genuinely believe that the UK will be better off isolated than closely cooperating with it's neighbours? over 50% of the entire UK import/export industry is directly with the EU, and that's not even mentioning the huge benefits the UK financial industry has due to trade received from the EU and into the EU. Withdrawing the UK from the EU makes very, very little economic sense.

But if they see that your german sounds as funny as their english they'll loosen up.  
Many foreigners say that Germans are somewhat direct in terms of communication. I can not ultimately confirm this. In terms of superficial topics, yes, but avoid anything that could put a German into an awkward or uncomfortable situation. These are mostly private topics. E.g. we never talk about how much money we earn. Never. Because either people *might* have expected you to earn more, or you earn more than the others, so that they on the other hand might feel uncomfortable. We never tell you that we don't like your new haircut, even if you asked (if somebody answers ""... ist mal ’was anderes."" it implies *hell, no*.) etc.

Was mir auffällt ist dass oft das Wort rassistisch benutzt wird. Kann man das im Falle Österreich:Deutschland überhaupt benutzen? Ich würde nichtmal Aussagen gegen Polen oder Spanier als rassistisch bezeichnen. Es ist ausländerfeindlich, aber es hat nichts mit ""Rasse"" zu tun.

Hab auch grad ein wenig ""recherchiert"" (den WP Artikel über Rassismus geöffnet) und dabei das hier gefunden:

&gt; **Kritik am Begriff**  
Fredrickson bemerkt, dass der Begriff «Rassismus» häufig unpräzise und unreflektiert verwendet würde, um die feindseligen oder negativen Gefühle eines «Volkes» oder einer ethnischen Gruppe gegenüber einer anderen und die aus dieser Einstellung resultierenden Handlungsweisen zu beschreiben (Fredrickson, S. 9).  
Kurt Horstmann schlug vor, nicht jegliche Diskriminierung irgendwelcher Gruppen als Rassismus zu bezeichnen und hält es für angebracht, u. a. in der Flüchtlingsforschung auf den Ausdruck «Rassismus» zu verzichten und stattdessen auf die Begriffe «Fremdenfeindlichkeit», «Xenophobie», «Ausländerfeindlichkeit» und dergleichen auszuweichen.

true,Oda_Krell,EURO,"German, living in the Netherlands","&gt;but what you say (the rebuttal) is exactly the conclusion of the report we're discussing. 

It's possible I misunderstood the finer points of the article, but I got the impression the Guardian article itself was rather neutral on the topic, and the position by Open Europe was somewhat contradictory. On the one hand:

&gt;[...] the report throws its weight behind continued British membership of the EU as it rejects a series of alternatives advocated by hardline Eurosceptics [...]

But later in the article:

&gt;Mats Persson, the director of Open Europe, said: ""Given the growing public hostility to the EU and events in the eurozone, the status quo isn't an option. Therefore, it is in the UK's interests to stay in the EU but renegotiate a new model for membership founded on a continued commitment to EU-wide trade but substantially less EU involvement in other areas.""

Sounds to me like they do actually believe renegotiation while staying a full member is possible.

* * *

&gt;The low speed would be a sort of second layer of the EEA, with rules handed out without meaningful representation.

I'll be honest, I know very little about what has been written about a two-speed Europe so far, and whether there has been any (inofficial, presumably) planning about the details, but without any knowledge  what has been said about it, I don't see why it would *have* to be the way you describe it. Take, as an example, financial regulations. Let's say the ""core"" Europe decides to implement some kind of supernational banking supervision body. Let's assume further the non-core doesn't take part in that. It would then depend a lot on what the consequences are for further transactions between core and non-core. If, for example, UK banks would effectively be barred from doing substantial business in the core, I would call it rather unfair and self-defeating. But if, say, core banks (under the supervision of the new body) get some preferential treatment *within* the core I'd say it's a fair compromise. Details like that would, in my opinion, determine if a two-speed Europe is going to work, or whether it's just a sneaky way to push the reluctant members out of the union in the long run.

&gt;For this reason the creation of the structure will require a sort of permanent constitutional settlement, about which there will be a lot of legitimate debate. Hopefully discussions have already been opened, so that they won't hold any necessary fiscal centralization up, later on.

Completely agree. Unfortunately, that discussion hasn't really started, not even among the (generally Europe-friendly) ""elite"", at least not in Germany.",0,1339435790,null,0,false,0,c4z5l8u,t3_uv5kl,t1_c4z5l8u,t1_c4z4z33,null,1429118169,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"Actually I have. It was mentioned in my primary or high school history book. I think there was one page dedicated to expulsion of Germans after the second world war. The page had a black and white image of a long column of expelled Germans. The text told that 12 to 14 million people were expelled, from which 2-3 million people died. While the text was as unemotional as possible, I did sense that something went horribly wrong. Later on I have read much more about it and things did went terribly badly after the war.

On that note I would like to say that the biggest problem isn't that people don't know about it. People do know about, they don't necessarily have the detailed image that would make them emotional about it, but they do know. The problem is that there is active denial in ex-Communist countries about their past. Their history is history of victimization, of being victims of both German and Russian aggression and crimes. They deny involvement in aggression and crimes against humanity fuelled by ethnic hatred. Even worse is belittling of this that is too practised.

Of course even in the western countries there has been denial of many things and it has taken quite some time to accept a new image of history. For example in Finland after the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was big push to appreciate veterans and the defensive victory they achieved. However only in the last 10-15 years it has come to public talk that the Finnish state did actually take part in operation Barbarossa, that the continuation war wasn't just some mishap of history. Also it has taken time to accept into public image that Finnish had concentration camps in occupied territories and their management was mismanaged - something that definitely constituted a war crime. This all was more or less buried under the victimization, under the Soviet/Russian aggression against Finland. 

In my opinion when we look at history, especially recent history, we have to judge things as they are - a war crime is a war crime - a crime against humanity is a crime against humanity. Accepting history as it is, doesn't diminish for example heroic deeds. I for example had a long net conversation with Russian lady, she told that her buildings housekeeper had been a concentration camp inmate when he was child, and had been traumatized by it. To her surprise I told that it was known in Finland that there were concentration camps, that it was judged being wrong, I was and am sorry for her housekeeper to have had to suffer like that. However in the same time I'm not sorry that my forefathers did fight for this country, they did big sacrifices for the future generations.

Lastly, while Europe needs to discuss more, and actively acknowledge more, I feel that the biggest white elephant in the European room is Russia. While USSR in its last year did start the process of discussing about sore subjects in its late history, the whole talk about it has died in the Putins Russia and been replaced by patriotic, nationalistic and imperialist view to history. That is very unfortunate as when European and Russian perspectives to war diverge even more, it can and it has created animosity between the two.",0,1339436521,null,0,false,0,c4z5rpz,t3_uw4sx,t1_c4z5rpz,t3_uw4sx,null,1429118255,24,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,24

true,cholo_aleman,GERM,Germany,"there are virtually no groups in germany who are asking for retribution. the sudetendeutschen/BdV represent a narrow political fringe in german politics who haven't been able in the past and most likely wont be able in the future to pursue their agenda.

i am fully aware that international law and international relations aren't always clear cut, so i can only express my own personal attitude in this matter. in this case, there is very little to be gained by digging up the past, so i feel the above mentioned [declaration](http://eudocs.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Czech-German_Declaration) provides an appropriate starting point to future developments:

&gt;(...) each side remains committed to its legal system and respects the fact that the other side has a different legal position. Both sides therefore declare that they will not burden their relations with political and legal issues which stem from the past.

in that spirit, i think that an official declaration from both sides, declaring an apology on both sides and promising to draw down legal instruments would be the right way to go. additionally, in the context of european integration and existing projects like euregio (egrensis/labe) an agreement on this matter could be a further step ahead.",0,1339438383,null,0,false,0,c4z685s,t3_uw4sx,t1_c4z685s,t1_c4z5sdf,null,1429118471,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

- Creates a central authority that can not only bypass the different parliaments budgetary approval, it can also decide what those budgets are.
- The budgetary approval would be shifted to elected officials on the European Parliament.
- No more national budgetary  F.Ups 
- The Euro becomes tied to a central economic policy.
- Being the economic policy a central one, this nullifies state debt and turns it to European debt.
- No different interest rates for different countries, as a matter of fact they should not even be allowed to issue debt. Only the ECB should issue debt.
- France, Germany and Austria and whoever is going strong at the moment keeps the euro strong as the underdog benefits from sustained growth. 

Downsides:

- It will be the sum of national shitstorms over sovereignty. Can be managed in the underdogs as their hands are tied, and can be managed on the big boys by using the Saving Europe pretext.
- The European Parliament will become a shitstorm each year when the budgets are voted as each country will try to get the bigger cut.

Things that are needed:

- Real European parties with ubiquitous representation all over Europe.
- A new system for electing our European representatives, that both represents each nation's interest as it secures the federation's general interest. (The good of Europe is more important than the good of a Member state).

I think it has a few problems though. The transylvanian saxons are a bit too far south and the German enclave in Belarus should be further east, on the Volga, not on the Dnieper river.

Also, the reason they went east was because a lot of them, during different times, were settled in low population area, and you would find said areas in the east.

In today's Romania (Transylvania to be more precise), for example, there were two colonizing periods. During the 12th-13th centuries, when the so called Saxons were colonized by the Hungarian Kingdom, in order to develop the area, and during the 18th century when the Habsburg empire reconquered the area from the Ottomans, and needed to repopulate some other war ravaged areas. This second wave is known as the Swabians. The first wave became Lutheran during the Reformation, the second wave was Catholic and remained so.

&gt;
&gt;    Real European parties with ubiquitous representation all over Europe.
&gt;    A new system for electing our European representatives, that both represents each nation's interest as it secures the federation's general interest. (The good of Europe is more important than the good of a Member state).
&gt;
&gt;How can this be done?
&gt;
&gt;    I have no idea.

Transnational districts (25 ppl for start) with lists from at least 9 (third) member states, more cohesion in election laws for european parliament, specifically requiring open list and Sainte-Laguë method (allowing for the modification of the quotient for the first seat to say 1.5 or 1.7) direct primaries for commission president candidates on the european elections, these lead the lists in the transnational district, and there was some contentious point about financing, not sure, perhaps european parties currently can't finance member parties election campaigns for european elections or something like that, and probably should to build a federal democratic space etc.

National branches of the parties would do well if the lead on their list was their national commission member candidate, since states can usually get the ones they want.

All of these proposals are in various states in EU Parliament Committees. Though I wouldn't expect them to pass easily, unless something dramatic changes in the positions of many parts of large parties.

As well as the scheduled transition to qualified majority voting according to the new rules, making the passing of directives through the upper house just combinatorially more likely. So the lower house has more room for assertiveness w/o blocking the european political process if doing so.

true,maladeus,null,null,"&gt;Well, you specifically said ""20 years tied up into that currency"". Saying we should continue on with the Euro because we have so much invested into it, blind to the costs of continuing with the project, pretty much is the definition of the sunken cost fallacy.

Please do not put in my mouth things I didn't say. 

To further clear my point of view: When I talked about ""20 years tied up into that currency"" I meant the common effort to take to term such an endeavor as to create a single currency for so different nations, and that this effort symbolizes what we can archive together. If the Euro dies then in part this notion dies, and I believe the idea that united we are stronger should prevail.

And to clarify EVEN FURTHER, I also believe that the (economical and social) costs of continuing are less than the costs of dropping the Euro.

Having clarified these points, I feel that this discussion has stagnated and is not worthy to continue. I wish you a good night.

It is a little bit schizophrenic background. 

[The Finnish concentration camps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Karelian_concentration_camps) were set up in the Russian Karelia, to hold up the Russian population that had remained there. It was bloody stupid and in my opinion the decision and functioning of the camps was much fuelled by anti-Russian hatred. However even more criminal was that the state allowed functioning of the [Einsatzkommando Finnland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzkommando_Finnland) full well knowing that handing over POWs would lead to their deaths. I do hope that schools now teach these things, and they probably do, because dissertations have been made about both subjects. People really should learn and make sure these thing won't happen never again.

I should note that the existence of concentration camps for Russians in East Karelia is again schizophrenic, because in the same time Finnish Russians fought in the Finnish army against the Soviets.

It sounds like the US just turned a blind eye as formerly-occupied nations, the UK, and the USSR took revenge on ethnic Germans, which is different from the US itself carrying out those atrocities.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"Yes and no. Money is safer invested in things that value alongside inflation. Things like property or precious metals. But that was in the old days and may now only be temporary, given the sudden unpredictable paradigm and even market irrationality. Besides, the EU is reluctant to do a american sized [QE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing) so nobody really knows how it will play out. 

The best thing to do is to invest in land and self-sufficiency (producing). It has always been so. It's also not a good idea to be in debt if SHTF, as things can spiral out of ones control although it can also allow loans to be paid in just months (think Germany in the 30s).

There are many variables in the system and it can lead to hyperinflation or deflation scenario along with the fiddling of interest rates. What is out of our control is the large hedge funds gaming the system and betting on certain outcomes. Wherever they go, the market follows and prophecies fulfill. It's a bit like having and elephant loose on a lifeboat. The derivatives market is literally a massive black hole of money waiting to swallow the world and reset the economy.

Why do we let the rich hide the money in tax havens hoping that they will use it to acquire some public bonds and then say governments ""spend too much""? Anything that goes against the middle classes will end up damaging the economy.

In ogni caso ho i miei motivi per pensarla come la penso, e uno di questi è ad esempio il fenomeno del cosiddetto ""clopping"". Per favore, se non sai cos'è non cercartelo... A meno che non abbia dei gusti particolari. Questo non dovrebbe interessarmi, e non lo fa sicuramente, ma la dice lunga so molti brony. Specie dal fatto che molto di questo materiale è addirittura futanari. Il bello è che mica me lo son cercato, non puoi stare 10 minuti a navigare su /b/ che questi ""bread"" appaiono. Un'altra delle cose che mi dan fastidio è il fatto che i brony debbano andare a dire ai quattro venti che lo sono. Seriamente, non mi interessa. Così come non mi interessa vedere memes e image macros che non solo erano cancerose prima, ma che vengono ponizzate diventando qualcosa di ancora peggiore. Ormai esiste una versione pony di **qualsiasi cosa** e non sto scherzando. E sì, questo mi da alquanto fastidio dal momento che il 90% di suddetta fanart presenta vignette stupide e che devo sorbirmi quasi ogni giorno mentre navigo.

E ultima ma non ultima, la loro mania di creare parole da brony, come per l'appunto ""brony"", ""bread"" e così via.

Questi sono solo alcuni degli aspetti che mi hanno spinto a diventare un ""hater"", e nonostante ciò non è che non abbia mai visto lo show. 3 puntate, saran poche, ma son bastate a farmi capire due cose:

1. Non seguirei il cartone per la trama dal momento che non ne ha una.
2. La morale dell'amicizia direi che è piuttosto ribadita e non credo ci sia tanto bisogno di andare in giro a parlarne come se fosse qualcosa di totalmente nuovo e fantastico.

I would use some of the techniques described in [this](http://lifehacker.com/5903288/i-learned-to-speak-four-languages-in-a-few-years-heres-how) blog (as featured by Lifehacker).

Word frequency is your guide for vocabulary focus, and tools such as quizlet.com or ankisrs.net your weapons.

But, as mentioned in the guide, pronunciation (at least to an understandable degree) must be developed. If your future wife speaks German, talk to her in it as much as possible - you need exposure and practice. If she is in another country, try cheap calling alternatives like through Skype. Other options exist through Youtube and the other sites mentioned here. I also used the Pimsleur series as a foundation (which are ridiculously expensive, but then, there are other means of getting them on the interwebs...)

After you have developed a language basis, another aid might be to find simple books that you really enjoyed and that you are familiar with and read them in German. Getting them might be an issue, however. I read the Harry Potter series in German as I was learning it and I believe it helped wonders. I also watched the Simpsons in German (which my German girlfriend and now wife sent to me), as I know many of them from my childhood by heart. These things cost money of course.

""Dr Ian Jenkins, deputy keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities, remarked that ""The British Museum is not infallible, it is not the Pope. Its history has been a series of good intentions marred by the occasional cock-up, and the 1930s cleaning was such a cock-up""

""According to documents released by the British Museum under the Freedom of Information Act, a series of minor accidents, thefts and acts of vandalism by visitors have inflicted further damage to the sculptures.[49] This includes an incident in 1961 when two schoolboys knocked off a part of a centaur's leg. In June 1981, a west pediment figure was slightly chipped by a falling glass skylight, and in 1966 four shallow lines were scratched on the back of one of the figures by vandals. During a similar mishap in 1970, letters were scratched on to the upper right thigh of another figure. Four years later, the dowel hole in a centaur's hoof was damaged by thieves trying to extract pieces of lead.[49]""

None that I know of. Some might indirectly. I am not sure.

It is

&gt;Are there many of them?

Estimates put them at around 10 million, most of them in (south-)eastern Europe. But it's hard to give an exact number. Many do not self-identify as such (out of a variety of reasons). Romania for example has half a million self-identified Roma, but the actual population is estimated at around 2-2,5 million.

&gt;Is their treatment a big issue in Europe?

Yes. And a controversial one.

As a matter of fact, I agree with some of your points, except the eugenetical. But, I believe you must realize that this isn't just a matter of protecting culture against another culture. If we want cultures to grow and change but on a natural, humane way, we must realize that the essence of the problem is capitalism. It's global capitalism that makes Americanization possible and led to mass immigration from poor countries to Europe. It also encourages the acceptance of immigration as these immigrants mean cheap labour for the capitalist. I don't disagree with immigration an sich, but I realize it can take the form of a destructive force.

The Old Right and classical nationalism wont save Europe. I think this thread has made that clear. The eradication of Volksdeutsche ánd Jews meant a loss for everyone and made Europe less what it was before. I believe this old right wing ideology still lives on in the form of the Front National, the PVV in Holland, the Tories, National Alliance in Italy and so on. But even if all these dispicable conservative parties get to power, they will only be able to postpone the inevitable. Because they are unable to see beyond their own populist bullshit. Their vision doesn't reach much farther than their voters. The populist right wingers in my country even started supporting the state of Israel. Fucking idiots.

The New Right of Alain de Benoist is a different story. I'm always looking for similarities between the radical left and radical right and de Benoist is certainly a figure that interests me.

Smile as much as you can, even in embarassing situations. I don't know if you come alone or with friends/familiy, but in all situations keep focusing on what's going on around you, don't stay in your ""tourist"" group. For example, if you don't understand something, try to communicate with the french person (even with signs), do not turn around to ask your friend and start speaking english.

About talking : don't hesitate to (almost) whisper, especially in a calm museum or in bus/subway. French usually don't like to hear what their neighbor say, no matter if he's french or a foreigner.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It is just the usual underclass-ghetto problems, it is not even necessarily ethnic, given that the British Chav-underclass is lily-white. When I lived in Britain I was surprised how ""gypsy"" the Chavs were in almost every detail: wearing tracksuits with cheap gold jewelry, being aggressive, playing gangsta, drunk at the age of 12, getting pregnant at 15 etc. etc. 

The tragedy of such problems is that essentially both sides are right. The anti-racist ""left"" side is probably right that it is the society who blame for this, after all why do have gypsies in Eastern Europe, Chavs in Britain, bedouins in Arab countries, Koreans in Japan, Blacks in America etc. almost exactly the same problems? Clearly there is little in common in them, probably there is much in common in their circumstances.

The ""right"" side is right, too, because simplistic ""leftie"" solutions of pouring money on them, hoping education will somehow magically fix it if enough money is spent, and yelling down any ""racist"" complaints from the majority and convincing the minority they are victims and thus fostering a culture of ressentiment in both majority and minority did not work and will never work. It is probably a whole lot more complex and if there is any solution, then it certainly will require some harsh measures like enforced school discipline. Or whatever else than what is currently being done, I do not know, but certainly something less utopian, less touchy-feely and more pessmistic and tough.

And the ""right"" is correct in that too that even if in the broad sense, collectively and over centuries that it is society to blame, it does not go down to the individual level: the average white, majority individual has  little personal blame and little personal profit from the plight of such groups, however he often has plenty of personal grievances such as getting mugged, he understandably does not want to pour much more tax money in the problem and he understandably does not want to be yelled down for being racist when he complains about situations when he was victimized by the minority group. This all is perfectly understandable from an individual point of view: we just want to live our lives peacefully and all we want from gypsies, blacks, bedouins, chavs, or whoever else is the problem group in a given society to simply leave us the hell alone. Just stay the fuck out of my neighborhood, don't try to break in my house, and limit your welfare claims to a reasonable level on my wallet, this is generally the right-leaning individual point of view. This too is perfectly rational and understandable from the viewpoint of the individual.

This is why there is little rational discussion and only shouting matches between ""left"" and ""right"". The ""left"" has a somewhat correct social diagnosis, but no real solutions so far, and they are out of touch with everyday people. They yell because they find it infurating how can people blame the victim? As from their historical, social point of view the minority is the victim. The ""right"" is in touch with the experience of everyday people, and correct in saying the ""left"" solutions are utopian, but generally rejects the social causes. They yell because they find it infurating how the ""left"" calls the complaining victims of robbery, rape etc. ""racists"", and because the ""lefts"" soft, utopian solutions look quite immoral, as in, failing to punish bad people, a bad, criminal subculture. From their point of view the ""left"" is evil, because they punish good people (the decent, neat middle-class citizens who got mugged and then complain and then get beaten with the ""racist"" club"") and reward bad people (the gypsy, black, chav, whatever in the given country, criminals and lowlifes).

Anyway. Greece has changed in some regards. As of last quarter of last year, their [primary deficit is gone](http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?SERIES_KEY=121.GST.Q.GR.N.D1300.PDF.D0000.CU.E). Without existing debt, Greece would be okay. I'm sure the others can do it, too.

From my experience, many Germans like the idea of a FTT. They might not really understand it, but their guts tell them it's okay to tax banks after everything that has happened. Eurobonds they don't like so much. But I think they can be convinced to agree to them if they feel that they're not just getting conned but actually get to influence how the money is spent.

The latter is the point. Unless Germans have that feeling, the powers that be risk creating a eurosceptic opposition by accident. So they push forward bit by bit, trying to come up with some compromise where the other countries will accept another limited pooling of sovereignty in exchange for limited access to German funds. And until then, they do just the minimum that is necessary to keep as much of the eurozone in one piece -- but not more, because that might cost just too much political capital for now.

Article 7 of ""the regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding"" (EC 2004/2003, as amended) states that

&gt;The funding of political parties at European level from the general
budget of the European Union or from any other source may not be
used for the direct or indirect funding of other political parties, and in
particular national parties or candidates. These national political parties
and candidates shall continue to be governed by national rules.

however Article 8 states

&gt;The expenditure of political parties at European level may also include
financing campaigns conducted by the political parties at European level
in the context of the elections to the European Parliament, in which they participate as required in Article 3(1)(d). In accordance with Article 7, these appropriations shall not be used for the direct or indirect funding of national political parties or candidates.

&gt;Such expenditure shall not be used to finance referenda campaigns.

&gt; However, in accordance with Article 8 of the Act concerning the
election of the members of the European Parliament by direct
universal suffrage, the funding of and limitation of election expenses
for all parties and candidates at European Parliament elections is
governed in each Member State by national provision.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I do not say that democracy has been more pernicious on the whole, and in the long run, than monarchy or aristocracy. Democracy has never been and never can be so durable as aristocracy or monarchy; but while it lasts, it is more bloody than either. … Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.

&gt;Authority has always attracted the lowest elements in the human race. All through history mankind has been bullied by scum. Those who lord it over their fellows and toss commands in every direction and would boss the grass in the meadows about which way to bend in the wind are the most depraved kind of prostitutes. They will submit to any indignity, perform any vile act, do anything to achieve power. The worst off-sloughings of the planet are the ingredients of sovereignty. Every government is a parliament of whores. The trouble is, in a democracy, the whores are us.

&gt;To be honest, this is making me increasingly uneasy. I don't think this will be democratic, nor will it be beneficial to my country / represent its interests in the slightest. Quite the opposite, in fact.

I agree about the democratic deficit (is there anybody in Europe who doesn't?) but as for national interests... I'm not so sure.

There's something to be said for deviating from a local maximum to try and find a global maximum. Here's a [crappy graph](http://localhostr.com/files/zaluT8d/Crappy_EU_diagram.png) to allow me to try and explain.

Imagine that we're at point 2. In the short term, more integration (moving to point 3) may be against our immediate national interest, but if it is a stepping stone to point 4 then the long-term positives outweigh the short-term negatives.

However, some say that we should stick to the status quo (point 2) or roll back integration (""Take back powers from Brussels!""; point 1) because it's better than the apparent alternative (point 3).

If I understand you correctly, ""sistema"" (system) is pronounced more like English ""thythtem"" in some places (I'm thinking mainly about Andalusia here) and more like ""system"" in others (mainly central and northern Spain).

Short answer: the ""correct"" way is ""system"". That's how somebody from the national TV or radio would pronounce it.

However, there's no actual ""right"" or ""wrong"" in regional pronunciations. There's no absolute and final measuring rule to compare against.

About how speakers with different pronunciations sound to each other: it mostly tells where are you from, regionally, there is no major pejorative implications. If I hear someone pronouncing ""th"" I would think ""he's form the south"" but not ""he's stupid"" or ""he's from a remote village"".

&gt; Toward the end of the war, when other neutral states refused to purchase gold directly from Germany, Switzerland continued to carry on this highly profitable trade. That gold generally came from two sources - the gold reserves of the central banks of the occupied countries and gold taken from individuals - including gold **dental fillings** extracted from corpses.

3rd paragraph:

&gt; Various Europeans—mostly Nazis—stole Jewish art, houses and other property, perhaps worth $72 billion today. In addition to robbing individuals, they also looted the gold reserves of countries they overran. Desperate to finance the trade with neutrals that sustained their war effort, the Germans smelted this monetary gold together with “victim gold”, **even including gold teeth from death-camps**, into indistinguishable ingots.

I believe what we are currently hearing is being done in order to address what you mentioned.. countries not following the rules and not being punished for it.

How do you go about doing that? First of all you have to be able to see the information for yourself, and also to have the authority to punish. This is where transferring some sovereignty to Brussels comes in.

Look at Greece.. a group of crook politicians cooked their books and lied about their situation.. It's on par with me logging into my bank account online, changing the code to show that I've got millions of SEK and then giving you that information. Can you trust that information? Suppose for whatever reason it was important that you know how much money I have, and I wanted to keep good relations with you.. shouldn't you be able to get access to my bank account? This analogy probably doesn't make too much sense from a perspective of two individuals.. but suppose if I'm screwing around with my balance and run into problems, you're gonna somehow suffer because of this.

Most of the problems are that a few countries may always mean well and make agreements in a serious way.. but the very same thing everyone is complaining is being shat upon -- democracy -- is what has caused the problems in countries like Greece. They get on a good path, and suddenly at the next elections someone basically says ""vote for me and I'll ~~borrow and~~ give you lots of money"".. So they vote for him and then start running a deficit leading to what they have today. Taking the fiscal compact as an example.. one of the main things to do with it was to write in the laws of each country that they have to pass a balanced badget and that no politician will ever be able to bypass it without breaking the law. Sweden agreed to this 'fiscal compact' for one very good reason -- Sweden, and most of the other nordic countries, already have such laws, so it makes no difference for them to be part of it or not, because all that is happening is that Europe is just catching up to what they already have.

So while a lot of countries meant well when they agreed to the Maastricht treaty ages ago.. The politicians that made those pledges were replaced a long time ago through **democracy**, which for *some countries* means 'who will give us the most government money and reduce taxes for us'.. without there being a mechanism which forces the politicians of each country to follow fiscal discipline.

tl;dr: Democracy is a good thing, but you can't really let the people decide how much money they should pay to the government and how much the government should pay them.. because they can be just a little bit biased at times -- in some countries more than others. At some point there needs to be some clear rule that says ""Dudes.. there is just no fucking money to give you all free healthcare, housing etc etc while you're paying 2x less total taxes than what it's gonna cost us to provide"". Sweden has much higher taxes for all the government services that the people demand. It would seem that the only thing keeping balance in Sweden is that it would be illegal for someone to come along suddenly, win the election by saying taxes will now be 5% -- and actually manage to lower the taxes (without cutting back on expenses) :D

P.S. Forcing a country to pay a fine that was meant to be big enough to make you think 'shit.. I don't really wanna have to pay that' in the middle of a really bad recession/depression would just add insult to injury. It's all about working out how to avoid ever getting to this point again (hint: doesn't involve getting rid of the euro -- unless they can't agree on how to fix it.. we aren't at this point yet.. my estimates tell me they have until the end of 2012 to fix it, because several countries have roadmaps to join the euro for 2015, which would mean they have a deadline to join ERM II by 2013 -- makes sense that they should make everyone feel better about the euro before that deadline)",0,1339518794,null,0,1339520061,0,c4zlred,t3_uxj0a,t1_c4zlred,t1_c4zlcoz,null,1429126019,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

In this case Germany has profited massively by exporting stuff to Greece, which Greece had to pay for, transferring massive amounts of wealth from Greece to Germany.

The reason why Greece imported so much stuff from the 'export world master' Germany was because this was cheaper than producing or buying this stuff in Greece itself (so, a good business decision in our economic system). German products are cheaper because wages in Germany are shit (real wages (that means accounted for inflation) even sunk during the last years). In contrast they would have had to pay fairer wages in Greece to the employees.

Then came a financial crisis that was mostly the result of unregulating the financial markets in the past. This lead to massive losses and the situation that Greece couldn't pay it's debts to German banks and debtors.

So, because the German capital wants to keep these claims as positive in their balances they made the German tax payers, so mostly the poor, give Greece money. Which was called shit like ""help packages for Greece"" although it didn't help Greece people -- the opposite. These packages just help German capital get its money, but now from the German poor because there's nothing more to get from the Greeks. This money takes the detour over Greece and gets labeled something nice but it's basically that. Those so-called help packages don't help Greece or their economy or the people, they prevent German banks from having to let go of their claims. All that money never arrives at the Greece people or the Greece state. It even just gets to them under conditions that worsen their economy and their situation overall, furthering the downwards spiral in the interest of the German rich.

No.

&gt; No one forced Greece to buy stuff from Germany. If they would get it elsewhere cheaper, they could've bought it there.

In a capitalist system you have to buy where it's cheapest, that's the only reasonable decision in our economic system. And Germany often is where it's cheapest because wages here are shit. If they would have gotten it elsewhere cheaper they would have done that.

&gt; Germany is also not ""export world champion"" because of Greece.

I never said that.

&gt; Wages in Germany are shit? Where do you get your data from?

Not compared to Africa, but compared to other (not only European) countries.

[Here's the development of real wages from 1995 to 2004 compared to some other countries](http://polpix.sueddeutsche.com/polopoly_fs/1.824966.1274120302!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/860x860/image.jpg), Germany the only one where it's negative. (Keep in mind that increased productivity should increase real wages over time, because one worker can produce more than before) [Heres a PDF with a graphic](http://www.boeckler.de/pdf/impuls_2008_14_1.pdf) for the time from 2000 to 2008, again Germany the only country where it's negative. Source for the first graphic is the Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung for the second one, but the data regarding wages and inflation is from the statistical agencies of the European union (or the German statistical agencies have the data about Germany as well, you can just look it up and create your own graphic if you want)

&gt; ...it is still the Greek that got the debts.

Partly by having fairer wages than Germany, partly by corrupt politicians. Nothing for which the Greek people should be punished.

&gt; Greece fucked up their economy all by themselves.

That they are not able to pay those debts is mostly a result of the financial crisis, which wasn't Greeces fault but the fault of unregulated finance markets and the system in general.

That they had those debts in the first place was to a big part because of German wage dumping. The only other choice Greece would have had is to follow Germany and dump their wages in the same way to keep competitive compared to Germany.

A financial union doesn't work if one country exports much more than others or makes more profits in general. That's why we have the Länderfinanzausgleich between the states in Germany and that's why such a thing would have been necessary on a european level too. But that's not Greeces fault that it didn't happen. Germany is the country that's profited massively from not having this, because they would have been the ones needing to pay to other countries (just like Bayern inside of Germany).

If each country still had their own currency they could regulate those unequalities through those mechanism. If everybody has the same currency the countries either need to be on the same level or there need to be transfer payments or the system collapses sooner or later.

Germany naturally doesn't push for something like this (Germany profited massively from bigger export profits through the Euro (because the countries exporting to couldn't regulate their own currency), Equalization payments would just cut into that again)

This is not true and it's explained in great detail in this article.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2012/apr/26/greece-europe-north-south-divide

""But if Europe expects Germany to pay the big chunk, it is our damn right to make sure our money is not burned but used efficiently""

75% of the money don't come from Germany. So Germany should behave accordingly. Also the money are not used for Greeks only.

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-23/merkel-should-know-her-country-has-been-bailed-out-too.html

This is also a good summary.

http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/peter-popham/peter-popham-amid-the-bailouts-a-united-states-of-europe-takes-shape-7834247.html

Europe's political engineers created the eurozone in the belief that its effect would be capillary: that as their citizens began to feel more and more like citizens of a single entity, their behaviour, too, would steadily converge. The common currency would draw all 17 countries towards the fully integrated promised land.

Instead, as Krugman points out, the opposite happened. For Germans, junking the deutschmark for the euro was an effective devaluation, which reduced the price of their exports, making them far more competitive in China and elsewhere, and cementing their position as Europe's dominant economy, with more than twice France's share of the world export market (and four times that of Britain).

But for the weaker economies, including relative giants such as Italy and Spain, the effect was of an entirely unmerited revaluation. Locked into the common currency, with devaluation no longer possible, Italy's weavers and Greece's fruit growers and the Irish towns that had persuaded Silicon Valley companies to build factories found themselves high and dry. The euro priced all of them out of the market. ",0,1339530185,null,0,false,0,c4zotpq,t3_uxmdi,t1_c4zotpq,t1_c4zo90g,null,1429127492,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

What I mean with poor is basically about 80% of the people. If the wealth distribution [looks like this](http://www.who-owns-the-world.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/netto.jpg) all those don't get their fair share of the wealth. And those are the ones that have to shoulder the burden disproportionate while the top 10% get lower and lower taxes. If the left party demands taxes for the rich that are lower than under Helmut Kohl but the press basically calls those demands unrealistic leftist crap something is very wrong in this country.

&gt; No. The reason Germany exports so much is because of the quality of its goods not because of the prices. If it was only about prices there would be no way for Germany to compete with places like China.

It's about both. The quality is good, but it's good quality at low prices.

&gt; Do you really think it would be better if they were unable to pay and the Euro as well as their country collapsed?

I think it would be better to help Greece's economy, I don't want their country to collapse, that's why the current policy Germany tries to push on those countries is so wrong. Austerity won't help them. And in the long run a financial union needs equalization payments (just like the Länderfinanzausgleich inside Germany) because otherwise it just will collapse again sooner or later.

Which means Germany contributes 25% which is by far the biggest chunk. You are just conceding my point. Also please understand that British news are much too biased especially when it comes to bashing Germany, so they are always to be taken with a grain of salt. Here's a ""Die Welt"" interview with greek writer Markaris which draws a totally different [picture](http://www.welt.de/kultur/article6523587/Wir-Griechen-sind-selbst-schuld-an-der-Krise.html) (German)

Europe expects us to take a leading role in this crisis. But everytime we are trying to act, we get to hear how we are all Nazis trying to take over Europe once again. What the hell does Europe expect us to do ? Throwing out our hard earned money like it was growing on trees ? Not going to happen. I would rather have Germany leave the EU, bring back the DM, and see how Europe gets along without us. 

So unless you don't have a solution for our situation which does not involve betraying the german people, you better think twice when critizing the way Germany acts in this matter.

Germany is by far not the cheapest country, neither in Europe, nor the world. Germany's wages are average if compared to countries with a similar economic level.

Quoted stats that show relative changes in wages don't support your point that wages are ""shit"". You might want to check absolute figures:

true,MightyMousePepTalk,UKGB,FIB - My life is a lie.,"I would agree with a post by sasp777 saying how it is very much now Metternich's vision of Europe, but a lot of the good things about Europe are little things that we notice.

There is a saying ""When you do things right, people don't realise you've done anything at all."" (Futurama.) At I feel that this can be very pertinent for the EU. You have heard all about the current crisis, and there are a lot of negative points for sure, but I won't go into them. Here are some of my thoughts:

- Apart from the conflicts that broke out after the fall of Yugoslavia, Europe has been at peace for some 60 years. 60 years of peace on a continent that never saw outbreaks of war, but outbreaks of peace. For centuries we obliterated our lands and our peoples, but now war is alien to us. It is something that happens elsewhere. You can argue that the Schumann Plan made this so, but its a fantastic achievement that can never be overlooked.

- **Our rights as citizens** This one is probably the biggest one that effects us on a day to day basis, but we don't even realise. I study in the Netherlands and I am completely free to do so thanks to Schengen.
 
Recently, I ended up in hospital after a drunken bicycle fall. I had fractured my hip. Did I pay? No: my EHIC card meant I was totally covered.

When things go wrong when we go travelling, such as the Icelandic volcano grounding all flights, it was EU rules and regulations that lead to  most of the refunds, hotel stays due to being stuck etc. 

There is also the European Consumer Centre, which acts as a central watchdog to make sure we don't get ripped-off no matter where we are inside the EU.

In short on this **The EU tries to make sure we, the consumer, do not get ripped off**.

- **The Erasmus exchange programme.** Ok, so this only applies to university students, but it was one of the greatest experiences of my life and I made great friends from all over Europe. This brings us closer as a continent and helps to build up a common European culture, and has been doing so since 1987.

- **The Euro.** Ok, so many may not agree because of the shit storm going on right now, and of course, having a monetary union without fiscal was a rudding stupid idea. But what was it like before hand? Every single country having its own currency. So many currency exchanges, so much money wasted in commission, exchange rates etc. The Euro is fantastic for the traveller. Remember I said I live in the Netherlands? Tomorrow I'm going to watch Germany v The Netherlands in Germany. All I have to do is bring my Euros and my ID. Passport control and currency exchange? Not needed. 

- The EU also has strict rules on quality of goods thank we can purchase (See CountVonTroll below on the**CE Mark**. This not only protects us as consumers against dodgey wiring and so forth, but also has the effect of making companies outside the EU to up their standards if they want access to our markets.

- **Common market** We have free trade between member states, but have tariffs up to those outside (with some exceptions. New Zealand diary, for example). Why do you think Britain wanted to join? It wasn't because she was all for supranationalism; she wanted the protection. Britain was subsidising her own farmers some 60% to keep them afloat against Commonwealth imports (due to the Commonwealth system of preferences). Joining meant that she could massively reduce these subsidies thanks to the CAP. We talk about free trade in the world, but we protect the shit out of our agriculture (namely France's), and this means complaints we hear from farmers, would be a lot greater without it.

These are just some of my thoughts. I realise people can think of a lot of negatives, and sure there are counter arguments to my claims, but I merely wanted to highlight the positive side of the EU so that we don't think it is all doom and gloom.

I am personally very much in favour of the EU, and whilst I recognise the need for change and reform, I feel we would be a lot worse off without it.

tl;dr EU seriously protects it citizens and makes life so much easier for travelling.

The thing that mainly determines competitiveness are the Lohnstückkosten (unit labour costs) and if you look at those you'll see that they developed significantly lower in Germany than in the other countries. [This article contains a graphic for this for the time period from 2000 to 2010](http://blog.zeit.de/herdentrieb/2011/05/10/deutschland-verscharft-die-eurokrise_3049) (the articles is worth reading besides of the graphic; also note that the Lohnstückkosten are relative to the development in Europe general).

Now, [as this article of the Financial Times \(also worth reading\)](http://www.ftd.de/politik/europa/:eu-sorgenkind-die-griechische-krise-hat-deutsche-wurzeln/50049276.html?page=2) states the goal for inflation in Europe is just under 2% yearly which would result in an according increase of the Lohnstückkosten. Over ten years this should be 21%, now for Germany it was 8% while it was 27% for Greece.

This wage dumping in Germany is what I mean when I say wages are shit. While other countries adjust their wages for inflation (and also productivity increases) Germany sinks them (see also the decrease of real wages). This is what I mean by ""fairer"", and this is one big reason for the whole imbalance of competitiveness in Europe (and consequently the whole crisis we have right now).

The major downside I see to EU rules is the centralisation of government.     When you live in Britain, and you have a problem, you go to London and protest.   When you live in Italy, you go to Rome.   But for EU regulations, you have to travel all the way to Brussels. 

Another problem is the complexity of the EU authorities.  According to wikipedia:  The European Union (EU) is governed by seven institutions. Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union lists them in the following order: the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the Court of Auditors.

In your home country, you have a legal system that is probably already difficult to navigate.  But in the EU, you have major complexity run by people speaking many different languages.     This makes government extremely inaccessible to the people that it affects.

Meet your familiar but frequently overlooked friend, the [CE mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_mark). I'm sure you've noticed its roundness on various products that you have bought, e.g., on the packaging for practically anything electronic, or on the swing set for the kids in the garden. To get it, the product has to pass an examination that ensures that it adheres to safety standards, environmental regulation and doesn't do bad things like causing interferences with radio equipment.

I guess Denmark could do that on its own. You could set up your own regulations and safety standards, do your own research about what is necessary, and set up your own national certification centers.  
Some manufacturers might actually bother to pay their lawyers to read the Danish regulations and have an engineering team make sure the product is conformant with them, go through the Danish bureaucracy and pay for the examination to get access to the Danish market, at least as long as they can be fairly certain they'll pass because you've picked e.g., the same frequency bands as some of the larger markets and haven't introduced anything too specific of your own. If they don't, you could still order it from across the border, you'll know your German consumer rights and warranty regulations soon enough, and the duties you'd have to pay upon import might not even be all that high. Just hope your imported toaster doesn't affect your neighbors TV set. But you have to admit it's simpler the way it is, and you probably don't like to wait an extra year to be able to buy the latest smartphone, either.

If we work together as the EU, we can introduce a new regulation, and manufacturers design to those specifications. We can do neat things like requiring manufacturers to take back electronic products at the end of their lives and recycle. We even do this for cars, which are being designed to conform to our environmental and safety regulations. How are the odds a car manufacturer would go through crash tests for all of their models just to be able to sell them in Denmark? Had Denmark tried to introduce the recycling requirement on its own, how many manufacturers do you think would set up a recycling system just to be able to sell their products there, if they wouldn't have to do it for other countries?
