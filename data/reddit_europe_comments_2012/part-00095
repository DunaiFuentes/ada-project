true,StuckEm,null,null,"I would first ask: what do you plan on studying? There is no central campus in Heidelberg. The university is spread out over the city. If you know what institute you'll be studying at then you could pick something that is close. As others have mentioned Neuenheimer Feld may be a good choice. The housing out there is pretty much students only and the rent is usually not too bad. 

For the options in Altstadt, the Europahäuser on Plöck and the apartments on Hauptstrasse can be a little loud at night since you're in the center of town and have to deal with the noise of the drunks going to the bars and home. But if you don't mind that then you're within walking distance to both dining commons and all of the institutes in Altstadt.

The options in the Stadtteilen would be a bit quieter. Most of them are not far from the city (10-15 minutes by tram) with the exception of Schlierbacher Schiff. You'll be living with other students but the neighborhood are locals.

I would not recommend Eppelheimerstr. 52. Its nickname is Alcatraz and if you look at it from the outside, you would see why. The two people I know who have stayed there have not had a good time. I would also avoid Schlierbacher Schiff and Leimen/St. Ilgen simply because they are too far away.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"Hmmm.. you might be onto something there.. how about they make a new law that requires american civilian guns to jam more often as a safety precaution (Patriotic Gun Efficiency Act) and ban the sale of european guns because they are unsafe and may be more efficient at killing many people at a time -- therefore only terrorists would own them? /s :D

Edit: Just thought another angle.. they can make them modular and sell different grades of effectiveness. Obviously the total price for the performance you get today will at least tripple, but you should be able to find several good deals which guarantee at least 2* bullets without jamming. Think about it.. more profits -- with innovations such as these there will be no more recessions.

Oh damn.. I'm getting very creative today... I just thought of something else... they can make it so you buy the base model and then there is a small part that you can change inside (which you buy for lots of money) which changes the rate of jamming. They would also implement a special safety mechanism called GRM (Gun Rights Management) which will make sure that the part is genuine and not a homemade unlock. If you try to tamper with it, it will cause the Gun to malfunction and make bullets explode (injuring the person holding it). In very small cases (just 5%.. nothing really), this functionality itself will malfunction and cause the protection mechanism to trigger with genuine mods -- but it's a small price to pay for public safety.

They could also implement 3G connectivity so that the gun can call home and make sure it's allowed to be active in case they want to make guns something people license.. this will also allow you to get 99%** yearly QOS for the price of only $0.99 per bullet shot. It will also allow them to deactivate anybody's gun at any time. The initial outrage would be contained by adding a small touchscreen to the gun and having facebook pre-installed on it so that people can discuss any scenario they find themselves in with their gun and need help picking who to shoot next.. Perhaps they can also install a small camera forward facing which would also allow you to record your victims being shot (for before and after), or even just photos.. with automatic backup using instagram etc.. omfg.. perfect.. lets patent it!! :D

\* Results may vary. Bullets not included.

\*\* Expect the gun to malfunction anyway for 87 hours and 36 minutes every year -- probably only when you really need to use it.

P.S. On a serious note.. Imagine how many dumb people would be caught posting guncam videos of getting a ""trespasser"" to beg for their lives while they laugh maniacally and then shoot them anyway -- then post it on facebook.. people who would otherwise have been innocent and were only acting in self defense :D",0,1343199431,null,0,1343202202,0,c5j1qgp,t3_x3vr3,t1_c5j1qgp,t1_c5j1056,null,1429463509,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; How about instead of pouring money into Greece so it can just pay it's debt interest we actually pour some money so they can fucking kick start their economy again?

Greece has two main problems, governance and its economy. Let's say they'd somehow fix the governance part and manage to get their bureaucracy to the point where it's reasonably efficient, or at least effective. That leaves the economy. Provided that reforms made it dynamic and competitive from a regulatory perspective, and unions would accept stagnant wages while the rest of the Eurozone accepted substantially higher inflation to gradually get Greek labor cost to the point where it's competitive again, all that would be left to do would be to pump enough money into their economy to fill the gap and spur investment, for about a decade or two, and then forgive Greece a sizable share of its debt. So far, so good, this seems simple enough. Germany basically did that with the East after the Reunification, and after two decades at about a hundred billion euros each, the situation there has improved substantially.

The problem is that Greece isn't the only country with problems. Spain definitely could use some large scale stimulus program right now. Italy, Ireland and Portugal could benefit from some kind of substantial debt relief.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As a native Hungarian and Budapester **let me give you a quick test whether you would like the Sziget or not.**

Imagine there is a really huge restaurant somewhere. And it is divided into multiple corners or parts, one corner serves Greek food, another Chinese, another really expensive and aristocratic French fine dining and another cheap fast food for students on a budget. And each corner or part is decorated and supplied with background music so that it fits the food served, the Chinese section has big dragon statues,  the Greek section is all blue and white and plays sirtaki, the expensive French section has marble tabletops or whatnot and very elegant waiters and classical music, the fast food section has posters of currently trendy bands and their music playing.

Would you go to such a place? 

If your answer is an enthusiastic YES - welcome to the Sziget!

My answer is NO and hence I dislike it.

Why is my answer no? Because _I can only sit in one corner of the restaurant and eat one meal at one time_ so I would rather to go a place fully dedicated to one thing and doing that one thing well and offering a fully immersive experience in that one thing without different distractions rather than such a mix and mash. The ""multi"" aspect of the restaurant is _simply something I cannot utilize_ - I will surely not get a Greek entry followed by a gourment bouillabaisse followed by a Chinese main meal and chasing it all down with a cheap hot-dog - what sense would that make? So if I spend all my evening in one part of it, just how will the existence of all the other parts make my evening better? I will either ignore them or be slightly annoyed by them.

One counter-argument can be that maybe OK the dining experience is not that great in such a place, but the good thing is it brings different people together and different people get to know each other, form friendships, have a rich mind-opening experience etc. - this is actually the official ideology of the Sziget (""Kell egy hét együttlét!"" - ""We need a week together!"")

My view is, my high school class had many different people, punks, rasta, white, Roma, mama's good boys and utter hooligans. Their relationship was not exactly an exciting exchange of different ideas and wonderful cross-subcultural friendships and mind-opening experiences, more like it ranged from trying hard to ignore the existence people who belonged to some different group to being annoyed with them and bitching about them to your friends in your own group. And this is the Sziget - a huge, multi-subcultural, multi-national high school class written really, really large.

Big Mac meals are about $8 each but I do agree food will be interesting. eating out will cost you about 15-25€ / person dependant on the restaurant. Try to go for lunch as most places have cheaper options for lunch. That will be already 30 €/$40 / day though. So we are already at 12 * 40 = $500 just for eating out. Breakfast is $1 bread + $3 toppings/drink * 12 = $50 and dinner depends on your wishes but is easily $10-$15 together. ( * 12 = ~$150) 

That means just food on a normal budget will be about $700. (judging by 12 days as most ""week trips"" only end up beeing 12 days on location and 2 days travelling).

Flights can be quite cheap, dependant on where you leave it can get as low as $500 / person. That will be quite a deal and means you are left with $1300 for housing and activities. (keep in mind places like the louvre or the catacombs cost entry as well!)

I do think it's doable as long as you find a good housing option. Even etap hotel would be in your budget but would obviously be missing the kitchen for your breakfast/dinner :/ Then again might give you extra budget to go eat out more.

As for the weather: anything before June can be dodgy in terms of weather but starting mid may can be nice. Keep in mind that even june can be bad if you catch a bad year like this year. The only ""safe"" months are mid july till early september but this will be the busiest tourist time.

I would check out the Europahäuser since they are specifically allotted for short-term/foreign students and a big emphasis is placed on meeting your fellow neighbors. IMO, I is probably the coolest since it's in one of the older buildings that has a courtyard with galleys alongside leading to the rooms. Very old-style European-esque. V is also pretty cool. Even though it's technically on Hauptstrasse, it's at the end of the street where a lot of the tourists don't typically wander. Plus they have a garden for garden parties.

I would forget about the ones listed as ""Altstadt."" The website is right. Competition for those spaces are high and the landlords will probably want someone who's going to be there for a longer term. 

Keep Neuenheimer Feld in mind. They have the most space and there is sufficient public transport between there and your institute. If you apply for housing there, I would go for one of the newer buildings. The older ones have seen better days. INF 134-136 are the newest. They got put up when the city, university, and medical center put a crap ton of money into re-development and now looks pretty damn nice.

These are claims which cannot be enforced and are not due by any particular date.

The ESM contains clauses demanding that the amount of allocated capital be checked and, if necessary, increased every once in a while (""but at least every 5 years""). 700 billion is just the beginning. Due to the nature of the ESM, I would not be surprised to find that the ESM shadow council alone, perhaps with support from the finance minister, will be granted permission to single-handedly increase the amount.

The ESM isn't through yet because it's a very bitter pill to swallow that is on par with euro bonds, but the parliament certainly didn't stop it.

Descent from a German parent

A person born of a parent with German citizenship at the time of the child's birth is a German citizen. Place of birth is not a factor in citizenship determination based on parentage.

Those born after 1 January 1975 are Germans if the mother or father is a German citizen.

Those born before 1 January 1975 could normally only claim German citizenship from the father and not the mother. Exceptions included cases where the parents were unmarried (in which case German mothers could pass on citizenship) or where the German mother applied for the child to be registered as German on or before 31 December 1977.

Special rules exist for those born before 1 July 1993 if only the father is German and is not married to the mother. The father must acknowledge paternity and must have married the mother before 1 July 1998.

A child born in a foreign country will no longer receive German citizenship automatically by birth, if his/her German parent was born after 31 December 1999 in a foreign country and has his/her primary residence there. Exceptions are:
The child would be stateless.
The German parent registers the child's birth within one year of birth to the responsible German agency abroad.

In case both parents are German citizens, German citizenship will not be passed on automatically, if both parents were born abroad after 31 December 1999 and have their primary residence outside of Germany. Exceptions are same as the above.

Those born in Germany and adopted to a foreign country would need to contact their local German Consulate for clarification of German citizenship.

Persons who are Germans on the basis of descent from a German parent do not have to apply to retain German citizenship by age 23. If they acquire another citizenship at birth, they can usually continue to hold this.",0,1343219972,null,0,false,0,c5j4231,t3_x4lwg,t1_c5j4231,t3_x4lwg,null,1429464658,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  Italy is a gnats whisker away from epic catastrophe and has been for the last 10 years, which says something of its ability to walk a tightrope but it is not in a good state. 

Italy's got a fairly sound banking system, good savings rates, and strong industry - all of which face off against inefficient employment and pensions regulations, corruption, and high debt.  Tightrope or not, without the debt crisis undermining creditor confidence, Italy would have muddled along.

Portugal has nowhere near the systemic issues that Greece has - neither anywhere near Greek corruption nor tax evasion (although it has both) - it's just poor and fucked up.  The problem with Greece isn't the size of its economy - it's that it's basically been a catalyst for kicking off a broader set of scenarios which, by themselves, need not have resulted in crisis.

The Portuguese are trying, hard, although that may not be enough.  That's what fucks me off about both Spain and Portugal - both countries' voters have generally accepted stupid amounts of austerity, and still the economies are growing worse.  

I'm tremendously worried about the point at which most citizens will just start saying ""fuck it, this isn't working"" and abandon the painful-but-necessary restructuring they've embarked on.

Portugal is not that much smaller than Greece and look what impact Greece is having, itself is a tiny economy on the European scale.

true,abw,null,null,"Well yes, but it's not quite as simple as that, at least according to my limited understanding.

The Government authorise the Bank of England to print money (although technically speaking they don't actually print any money, just adjust their electronic bank balance to have £X billion more).  The bank then uses that money to buy government bonds. In the short term, the government gets a shitload of money to spend now that previously didn't exist.  The bank get a shitload of government bonds without having to pay anything for them (because they used the newly ""printed"" money that was given to them).  Although these don't provide any direct profit for the bank in the short term, they will over the longer term.  

In effect, the government has taken a ""loan"" from the Bank of England which will eventually need to be paid back (plus interest) by us and future generations of tax payers.   It's just like you or I going to a post office and buying a National Savings bond: you give the government £X now and they promise to give you £X plus a bit at some point in the future.  The ""problem"" with the general public buying billions of pounds worth of bonds is that it would take real money out of ""the economy"" (our pockets) that we couldn't then go and spend on other things.  The same argument is used to justify why the banks shouldn't have to use their own money to buy government bonds (well, they do use their own money to buy them all the time, but I'm taking specifically about QE here) - if the banks spent umpty billion quid on government bonds then they would have less money to lend to other banks, business, etc.

So QE is great (according to them) because it doesn't damage the economy.  The government has the money it needs, the banks still have money to lend out, and you and I still have the money in our pockets that we would otherwise have spent on buying government bonds.  But it's a false economy.  It's rather like the school bully singing his own praises for letting you keep your lunch money today - just as long as you give him double tomorrow. 

In reality the whole ""stimulating the economy"" line is a smokescreen.  The purpose of quantitive easing is to get some quick cash for the government.  In the short term, it's better to print the money than take it ""out of the economy"", but in the long term it just leads to inflation and devaluation of the currency.  They would like you to think that the money gets spent on development projects, etc., to ""stimulate the economy"" but in reality it's just used to service the existing government debt.  In other words, the government is borrowing money from future generations to pay the *interest* on the loans that it's already got.  Incidentally the currently cost to service the UK's £1 trillion debt is around **£143 billion per year** ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_national_debt#The_National_Debt_Today)).  That's around 11% of the GDP or 2 rounds of QE at £75 billion a pop (or 3 at £50 billion if you prefer).

Who does the interest get paid to?  Why the banks, of course!

**TL;DR:** The Government/BOE don't want to lend the money directly, give development grants or anything else like that.  That would defeat the real purpose of the exercise which is to sell government bonds (i.e. increase government debt) to pay off the interest on existing government debt.

I wouldnt say they were stupid amounts of austerity, had they not been in the Eurozone they'd have defaulted or devalued - both are very painful although not always as evident in the short term.

The main problem for both countries is the distance they have to travel, both - like Greece - have squandered the past 20 years and undertaken relatively little reform.

Germany, and others, may be making hay while the sun shines (low exchange rate) but they will have to deal with their own problems once this crisis is over and simply bailing out the Med countries weakens their own prospects in the future.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I wouldnt say they were stupid amounts of austerity, had they not been in the Eurozone they'd have defaulted or devalued - both are very painful although not always as evident in the short term.

Well, devaluation is generally considered to be a last resort.

However, that said, it's also an important tool for a treasury to at least have in its arsenal.  That in itself can be a source of confidence for investors.  Or, if nothing else, it means that a national government at least has a whole range of tweaks at its disposal for playing with its currency.  

&gt; The main problem for both countries is the distance they have to travel, both - like Greece - have squandered the past 20 years and undertaken relatively little reform. 

IMHO ""squandered"" is too strong a word, especially in the case of Spain.  The Spanish crisis is mainly the result of a property bubble gone bad, with massively bad banking governance underlying it, and recession elsewhere (e.g. the UK, where pensioners all of a sudden could no longer finance their Costa Brava retirement dreams) kicking things off for good.  Spain has had a series of governments which, despite frequent ineptitude and pusillanimity, made an honest go at structural reforms - the economy experienced strong average growth throughout the 2000s, among numerous other actions.

I'd contrast this with the Berlusconi governments, brought in as a  sort of petulant ""screw-the-establishment"" choice, which ended up as a self-serving, corrupt mess.  

With regards to Spain, the thing that most concerns me is that their star performer, Catalonia, actually appears to be one of the worst sinners when it comes to excessive debt and financial discipline.  Ouch.

&gt; Germany, and others, may be making hay while the sun shines (low exchange rate) but they will have to deal with their own problems once this crisis is over and simply bailing out the Med countries weakens their own prospects in the future. 

I think anyone but the most dim-witted or fanatical understands this - but the issue right now is that the cost of a Euro collapse or even selective disassembly is (still) greater than the cost of fixing it. 

To be fair, I fully understand the reluctance of the Germans to pour more money in, but they're essentially faced with the choice between a huge up-front expense and an almost certain even greater loss if they kick the can down the road.

&gt; The US acted quickly to solve its banking crisis and is mostly the stronger for it.

Yup.  And here we have the problem - a currency system with no centralized political willingness or even the tools to quickly and decisively respond to crises.  The ECB has done a reasonable job given the authority and means at its disposal, but that's far from enough.  

This is even worse given the French and German (among others) flouting of the stability &amp; growth rules in the early 2000s - not to mention the fundamental idiocy of bringing in countries that simply were not compatible with the requirements to join a common currency, often against the expert opinions of those hired to assess their health.

Yes, but the Club MEd/PIGS have a tradition of doing it quite a lot since WW2 since it does the least amount of political damage upfront. Not to say they are the only ones who have done it, the UK also has on a few occasions.

&gt; IMHO ""squandered"" is too strong a word, especially in the case of Spain.

I disagree. There are a lot of sectors of the Spanish economy which is effectivly a cartel. The one that spings to mind and I am most familiar with is Pharmacies, these are limited and very little genuine competition exists. You cant just open one. 

Equally, a lot of farmers and construction companies (particularly in the south) hired cheap immigrant labour on the black market which is one of the reasons that official unemployment rate was so high even during the boom. Again, the government did little to help itself. 

You're right to point out the impact of the Brits and Germans have upon the Costas but this should have been obvious to the economic advisors and mitigated.

&gt;  And here we have the problem - a currency system with no centralized political willingness or even the tools to quickly and decisively respond to crises. The ECB has done a reasonable job given the authority and means at its disposal, but that's far from enough. 

Indeed, but it is the willingness (and I do accept this necessity on a pragmatic level) of the ECB and others to bend the rules that is most worrying from an EU point of view.

Nonetheless, for a significant amount of time after WWII, until the Democrazia Cristiana thing really blew up, Italy was actually a very very robust, healthy economy.  Spain and Portugal, not so much, seeing as how they were fascist dictatorships until the late / mid-1970s, respectively.

Greece, I have no idea where that came from.  And Ireland seems to have been a typical case of ""lolmoniez!  Whee!"" where a solid robust growth track was derailed by everyone deciding that they were now rich.

This is true.  There are also a great number of other terrible vestiges of backward economic practice - the labor situation you mention isn't even the worst of it, one of the reasons for so much black labor being used is the insane amount of bureaucracy involved.  

Nonetheless, these need not be emblematic of an unhealthy economy.  I'm Swiss and live in Germany - both countries have their hilarious share of asinine, medieval, protectionist nonsense.

Absolutely agreed - that said, at least under Draghi, the ECB has come out looking like one of the more responsible, intelligent actors over the past 2-3 years.

The main problem here is that the EU should fundamentally be an economic union, but it's turned into a political one.  Programs ranging from very banal day-to-day things like standardization of power sockets, over Erasmus, to Schengen, are all wunderbar.

Nun, die von dir (ich duze dich mal) so bezeichneten ""Geo-Politik-Theorien"" sind nicht etwa wirr sondern seit jeher, wie in diesem m.E. sehr guten Artikel beschrieben, die Leitlinien der US-amerikanischen Außenpolitik. Diese von Halford Mackinder, Mahan und später Karl Haushofer ausgearbeiteten Theorien sind bestimmend gewesen für jede US-Administration. Die kürzliche Äußerung des (außenpolitisch noch recht unbedarften) Mitt Romney, ""Russland sei der geopolitische Feind Nr. 1"" sind in diesem Kontext zu sehen. Nebenbei waren diese Sichtweisen im Falle Haushofers auch bestimmend für den Deutschen geopolitischen Ansatz des Zweiten Weltkrieges. Die Eroberung der Sowjetunion stellte auch für das Deutsche Reich die Kontrolle über das ""Herzland"" als Grundlage des Kriegsziels der ""Weltherrschaft"" dar. 
Was der Artikel auslässt ist, dass es für die USA zum Erhalt der Dominanz auf den Weltmeeren vor allem darauf ankommt dem ""Herzland"" den Zugang zum Meer zu verwehren. Während unterstellt wird, dass das ""Herzland"" zum Meer drängt, um seine Macht weltweit projizieren zu können (Stichwort Flottenstützpunkte, Nutzung der Meerengen von Gibraltar, Bosporus, Skaggerak etc.).

Für die USA hat dieser Konflikt genau eine Dimension: die im Artikel beschriebene. Es gibt selbstverständlich andere Ursachen und Aspekte dieses Bürgerkriegs aber keiner davon ist die Ursache dafür das Hillary Clinton giftspritzend und geifernd durch die Welt reist wie sie es derzeit tut.

Bonusinfo: die USA unterstützen auch Israel nicht deshalb, weil sie Juden so prima finden und eine ominöse ""East-Coast-Lobby"" die politische Elite dazu zwingt. Sondern aus dem einfachen Grunde, weil es nach einem erkalten der Beziehungen zu Israel, genau zwei Wochen dauern würde und Israel die ersten Stationierungabkommen mit Russland abschließen würde.

Das, was auf der Wikipedia-Karte als Pivot-Area markiert ist, bezeichnet das heutige Russland, bzw. deren Einflussphäre. Einschließlich Ländern wie der Mongolei und Syrien. Womit wir übrigens bei dem Berührungspunkt von Syrien und dieser Theorie sind.

Das ist aber auch alles. Nur, weil Syrien in einer verrückten, alten Theorie vorkommt, heißt das noch lange nicht, dass uns diese Theorie etwas über einen aktuellen Konflikt sagen kann. 

Und Russland wird derzeit von korrupten Bürokaten regiert, die sich alleine durch ihre Loyalität Putin gegenüber auszeichnen. In diesem Klima gedeit nur eins: Die Ausbeutung der Rohstoffe. Und ein reines Rohstoffland kann höchstens noch regionale Ansprüche geltend machen (siehe auch Saudi Arabien). Für globalen Einfluss reicht es schon lange nicht mehr.

- it excludes the possibility that they are an opposite gender couple, but both partners share the same legal sex (for example, one partner may be a transsexual who has yet to change their legal sex, or is unable to do so due to the huge legal obstacles),
- it excludes the possibility that one or both partners may be genderqueer,
- the marriage doesn't have a sexual orientation -- the people in it do.

I realize this is nitpicky. But it is simply more correct to say same-sex marriage, since that's what's at stake, not gay marriage.

Diese Thesen bildeten den Grundstein für Dean Achesons geographische Formulierung der Containment-Doktrin und beeinflusste auch Henry Kissinger und Zbigniew Brzezinski.""

Zbigniew Brzezinski, den ich mal eines der größten Arschlöcher des 20. Jh. nennen möchte, der Mann, der Osama Bin Laden mit aufgebaut hat, ist übrigens immer noch heute ein angesehener Sicherheitsberater Obamas.

&gt; ""With so many Africans in Greece, at least the mosquitoes of West Nile will eat homemade food."" 

You could argue that it implies that infection of black people is an upside to the movement of the disease into Greece, also perhaps that there is an inherent or natural connection between Africans and disease, and it certainly has a dismissive attitude towards black people's well being. 

Imagine someone saying 'black people make excellent fertilizer for banana trees'. I mean, it's technically true (people make excellent fertilizer, and fertilizer is probably useful for banana trees), but it's also racist, because it implies that 'that's all blacks are good for', and alludes to the traditional racist imagery of black people and bananas. 

Most racist comments have the racism implied rather than formally and logically stated. Another topical example- saying 'you black bastard' is not the same as saying 'you lanky bastard', 'you purple nosed bastard', 'you fat bastard'. It's not enough to say 'he is black, and he is also coincidentally a bastard, and therefore the comment is not racist'. Or when John Barnes, an English footballer, had bananas thrown at him, it's not enough to say 'how thoughtful the crowd are, to provide him with a nutritious snack'.

Also, I suspect there would not have been the same reaction if she wasn't apparently supportive of Golden Dawn. Arguably that is enough- a British Olympian who had expressed support for the BNP would almost certainly get thrown off the team, especially if the circumstances were similar (being supportive towards a far right MP who had recently hit a woman on TV).

Stay away from Frankfurt Airport though. 
It's the largest freight Airport in Europe and you don't want to live near that, no matter how large/cheap etc. the house is. Some friends of ours live in the area and it just sucks if you can never open the window.

I was born in Wiesbaden and in comparison to other German Cities it is rather small and quiet. The happening place for the whole area is Frankfurt (this counts for Darmstadt as well), but you wouldn't want to live there either, really. Specially not with 3 dogs. 

Dog Parks are almost non existent in German Cities so, again depending on where you're going to be, you're probably better off in the suburbs/country.

For the Internet: If you don't want a lot of surprises, complex payment structures etc. You'd probably want to go with Telekom. They may not be the cheapest, but I think simply because of the size it's highly probable that you find someone there that speaks English and can handle your need for an earlier exist should you be re stationed.

Same goes for Mobile, German Telekom offers that as well and it should most probably just work for you.

From there you can tweak towards what your specific needs are and shop around (and most likely find) a carrier/ISP that fits that better. Again, this depends on what exactly you need.

http://www.onlinekosten.de/ let you search for the cheapest ISPs and Mobile Carrier. If you use Chrome (right click, translate to english) then the translation should be good enough.

On top of that, if you want to save money or do something for the German environment you can also pick your electricity provider and either for cheap or renewable and pay a few cents more per kw/h.

Depending on the house and how they heat you may also be able to pick a gas provider.

Getting a mobile plan is a matter of minutes, if your paper work checks out. In Germany we have ID cards which prove citizenship and the place of resident. You're not going to have that so it may be a bit more of a hassle. Find out what papers you need to bring. Internet is pretty much the same on the contract side. In most places now there should have been some sort internet before, so they just need to hook it up, which might take a few days.

For the Hotel, no idea. But if no one else can come up with a better plan, I'd search on google maps for hotels in the area, load up skype with a few dollars and call them.

In reality, some of you don't **want** it to be considered insensitive. But that's an entirely different animal. Also, good luck with that agenda.

On the other hand, the term **racist** is entirely too strong for a remark like this, and naming it as such follows the *also* entirely retarded trajectory of US-style political correctness.

Es ist OK, wenn man jung ist und kein historisches Gespür hat. Deshalb erkläre ich Dir hier mal ein paar kleine und wichtige Unterschiede: Es gibt Menschen, deren politischen Assoziationen und künstlerische Werke man trennen kann. Bei anderen geht es nicht. Diese Lieder fliegen dann raus. In der Kirche werden auch Lieder von Monarchisten gesungen. Oder Mönchen die vielleicht mal für die Inquisition waren. Meine Oma fand die Hitler auch toll, als sie jung war. Wenn sie ein Kirchenlied geschrieben hätte, in dem es nicht um Nazis ging, was wäre dann mit dem Lied gewesen?

I don't know if this is what you're looking for, but these are things I did, and that I can recommend doing:

* Visit Pont Saint Esprit

* visit Aigueze, Saint Martin d'Ardeche

* visit Orange by night (amazing Roman theatre, must see. Also a lot of pubs and bars)

* Kayaking (how could I not)

* The Pont d'Arc as someone else pointed out; it's nice but very crowded, especially on weekends.

* the Ardeche region is close to the Cote du Rhone region, famous for its wines etc. There are a lot of wine cellars that sell their products directly that are worth visiting

* I also went hiking along the river, we started out in Saint Martin d'Ardeche and walked upstream, very beautiful.

* The French National Geographic Institute makes great topographical maps of every region in France, including the Ardeche. I got mine at a A.S. Adventure store.

* There are a lot of campings around Saint Martin d'Ardeche and Pont Saint Esprit that are cheap and reasonably well equipped. I don't know where you're staying, but if you're on a camping don't take the spot right next to the river. The frogs are LOUD, especially at night.

* A bit more to the north than the Gorges de l'Ardeche where I was staying, is the Monts de l'Ardeche region. I didn't have the time to go walking there, but I think its worthwile.

I hope I could be of help, have a nice trip.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"Well, [this](http://i.imgur.com/op5cX.jpg) is what Houston did to its city hall after Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage.  In case it's a bit unclear, our city hall has the colors of the gay pride flag projected onto it.  Houston did that every night for the entire month of June, I believe.

&gt;when Obama ended DADT or when he said he supported gay marriage, there was outrage

I don't recall much popular outrage over the end of DADT, probably because DADT was a rather soft prohibition to begin with.  The gay marriage issue has caused outrage, that is true.  However, the surveys I've seen have consistently shown a majority in favor of allowing same-sex marriage.

There is of course the usual Republican/Democrat divide on these issues, though a significant number of Republicans are now ok with gay marriage.  Oddly enough, there's a substantial number of gay Republicans...for example, our mayor, who is a lesbian, is a conservative.  I don't get it either.  Perhaps, for some wealthier gay people, their economic class interests trump their sexual identity interests.

There is also a city/country divide on gay rights: city dwellers are more likely to support same-sex marriage, while country folks are more likely to oppose it.  I've lived all my life in big cities and don't feel very connected or similar to the rural people of America.  While gay people can live and work pretty comfortably in Texas' cities, an openly gay person might have trouble with social ostracism in a small town.  I'm not sure of that, however, as I have not spent any significant amount of time in small American towns.

Do you think it's an accident that all but one of the deadliest food poisonings in recent history have happened in North America?

I know where you're coming from with your rhetoric, I used to also believe that forbidding companies to sell poisoned food should be enough, but it really isn't. They absolutely need to be told things like ""don't dumps sewage on your crops"" or ""wash off the caked shit from the cow before slaughtering it"". Or ""products classified as &lt;chicken meat&gt; should not contain more than 0.1% of fecal matter by weight"". 

You are right, on the grand scheme of things not too many people die from food-borne illness, not even in the US. What's a couple of thousand deaths a year for a country of 300.000.000? You're at a greater risk of dieing from a car crash when you get behind the steering wheel every morning. And that is exactly why regulation is needed, otherwise companies will start to make risk-based calculations and decide that a couple million extra dollars on the bottom line is worth the risk of killing a couple of people, as well as the unfortunate negative PR and possible fines associated. 

You sound like you're rooting for the little guy, talking about barriers of entry and such, but there's really no one that would love less oversight and less regulations than the giant food corporations that control 95% of what's on your plate.

One of my best friends moved to Munich about a year ago. Just like you she was alone at first but she spoke the language (as far as you can compare bavarian German to ""normal German""). 

However she had a little bit of trouble adjusting for the first few months because she was not that much of an outgoing person. So in my opinion people living in Munich need a little ""push"". Be active about your social life and about meeting new people then you should be okay.

As far as housing is concerned, well, we know it is expensive in Munich. But the hardest part is finding the right apartment. So you will have to make use of a realtor if you are not in any way connected in Munich. This might cost a few Euros but it will be totally worth it.

Also beschränke ich mich auch auf die Rolle der USA. Das ist mir auch lieber als Dir den ganzen Konflikt noch zu erklären. 

Also Deiner Meinung nach gibt es zusammengefasst (dafür hätte man Clinton gar nicht erwähnen müssen) einen Grund: Russland soll nicht Eurasien dominieren. Deshalb machen die USA Stunk in Syrien. Das hat nichts mit der [israelisch-amerikanischen Beziehung](https://www.google.com/search?q=israelisch-amerikanische+beziehungen) zu tun (die auch nur geopolitik-bedingt ist, was übrigens ebenfalls riesiger Schwachfug ist)? Das hat vor allen Dingen nichts mit den guten Beziehungen der USA zu den sunnitischen Mächten der Region zu tun? Oder der Türkei? Oder, vor allen Dinge, dem Irak und dem Iran? Beschränken wir uns auf den Iran. Deiner verrückten Theorie nach würden die USA eine iranische Atombombe begrüßen. Weil dann die Iraner gegenüber Russland unabhängiger agieren könnte. Also die Gefahr, dass Russland Eurasien dominiert, abnimmt. hahahahahahahahahahaha

So viel Dummfug. Das tut richtig weh. 

Auch die Vorstellung, dass eine Macht, und zwar Russland und nicht China, komplett Eurasien dominieren könnte ist lächerlich. Da lag ich ja genau richtig, als ich in meinem ersten Beitrag kurz angesprochen habe warum Russland auf einem absteigenden Ast ist. Klar hat sich Russland in den Nuller Jahren in Georgien, Weißrussland und der Ukraine auf der weltpolitischen Bühne zurück gemeldet. Aber für mehr reicht es einfach nicht. Schon alleine aufgrund des Gegendrucks. Nach der Ukraine fängt die EU an. Und Georgien gehört schon fast zur Nato. Der einzige Zankapfel befindet sich in Mittelasien. Irgendwo zwischen Usbekistan und Turkmenistan. Gibt es dort Wasser? Ja, ein wenig. 

Also drüber nachgedacht geht es den USA einzig um die russische Militärbasis in Syrien? Die einzige russische Basis in einem Land außerhalb der ehemaligen Sowjetunion?

Solche kleinen Ausrutscher lassen tief blicken. Hier zum Beispiel setzt Du ganz nebenher die Gewalt der Antifa und die der Nazis gleich. Das ist nachweislich falsch und eine Verharmlosung der Rechtsradikalen. Es gibt seit 20 Jahren kaum Opfer der Antifa-Gewalt bei den Nazis. Dagegen gibt es 183 Todesopfer der rechten Gewalt. Klar ist Linksterrorismus ein Problem, welches ich nicht verharmlosen will. Aber Rechtsterror hat eine völlig andere Dimension. Mit einer vielfach höheren Anzahl an Todesopfern. Und das sind nur die Toten. 

Also ich bleibe bei meinem Verdacht, dass Du vorsätzliche verharmlost. Rechte Musik ist für Dich kein Problem, so lange die Texte nicht eindeutig sind. Das ist geplante und gewollte Ignoranz. Denn so funktioniert nachweislich die Masche der Rechtsrocker. Über die Musik wird die Jugend geködert und dann über immer weiter gehende Texte langsam radikalisiert.

Wie alle Monotheisten glauben diese an die unumstößliche Übermacht und Alleinvertretung ihres Gottes, was als Rechtfertigung abgeleitet wird, dass die eigene Erkenntnis viel besser ist als die von Anhängern anderer Religionen oder Gottlosen.

So wie Hitler und die Nazis...

Ob Salafist oder Christ, alle glauben ihr Gott hätte recht...und damit hätten sie in ihrem Lebenswandel auch recht. Der Christ glaubt er täte recht, wenn er Gott darum bittet sein Essen zu segnen obwohl der selbe Gott in Afrika Christen verhungern lässt. 
Die dämlichen Salafisten glauben halt ihr Gott wär der ganz tolle und wer für ihn (obwohl ausdrüclklich im Koran verboten) Tötet kommt schneller zu besagten Jungfrauen.

Da kann man sich doch mal Fragen ob in einem säkularen Staat, also einer wo Gott nix zu sagen hat, zum einen alte Menschen immer eine Religionspartei wählen...und viel wichtiger wäre: wieso sind das alles Verbrecher?

But it's not because of race _per se_. If you check IQ tests performed across people in similar socioeconomic situations, the differences smooth out. If you look at people with similar education, the differences smooth out. If you look at people with similar nutrition levels, the differences smooth out.

Most of the difference in IQ can be ascribed to poor economic conditions, childhood nutrition levels, poor education levels, and unstable societies which don't let people develop as well as they would otherwise.

The same holds true within white populations.  IQ is higher in more developed European nations, and lower in less developed European nations.

true,Deusdies,EART,Earth,"&gt; Would it cause inflation? No. Because the money was printed and spent over many years, there is no sudden massive printing going on, rather it's simply wiping out what was already there.

See that's where you **may** be wrong. The hyperinflation in Yugoslavia was due to sort-of QE. I fear that if QE were in place, politicians would quickly lose control. Moreover, it would give the governments the ability to borrow more and more, without really stopping. Borrowing is not bad as long as the borrowing rate does not exceed real GDP growth rate - however, we have been witnesses of this not really happening in the past decade or so. Now I'm not saying that it will definitely cause inflation, but it just *may*. And if the inflation gets out of hand, well... look what happened with Germany between wars, look what happened with Yugoslavia, etc.

This is not just a moral hazard, it is a legitimate hazard. The amount of money in an economical system (the money mass) must carefully be controlled. Sure, a country in a good economic system such as Germany could afford some QE, but majority of the countries in the EU or eurozone for that matter cannot. 

You can't really wipe out debt. If by your analogy ""you wipe out the debt with QE in one stroke"", that will immediately cause inflation and god knows what happens then. Even QE has to be done over time, with great consideration and care.

I look at the QE as a measure of last resort. After QE, I don't really see any other viable option for economic recovery. The US is in my opinion in worse economic shape than most of the EU, since they've been doing lots of QE over the past few years yet they still can't control their budget deficit (i.e. there's no political will to do so) or their debt. The US also has several more bubbles (student loans, cc loans) that will burst within the next 10 years.

I don't think the situation in the EU as a whole is that dramatic. Sure, Greece is in shithole, Spain and Portugal less so, but that still leaves 24 countries that are in relatively good economic shape or at least in a shape that is manageable and fixable in short term. In my opinion, the cost of QE would outweigh the cost of Greece exiting out of the euro. 

You're also forgetting the fact that if you do QE in one stroke and lower the debt level to 60% of GDP, who do you think is going to lend you the money the next day? 

In my opinion the real solution lies within the structure of the EU and the EMU itself. It needs to be restructured. You can't expect the EMU to function flawlessly without having automatic amortization mechanisms in place. You can't expect the EU or the EMU to function flawlessly when 15 countries agree on something, 10 don't, and 2 ""will see"". All the efforts so far were good, but they weren't really put into practice.

Consider, QE has already been going on for 4 years, the money has been printed and entered the system, the UK inflation went up somewhat, it reached 4.5% but now has fallen back a lot and is getting near target (2%) much of that inflation was partly down to currency depreciation. But the money has already been printed, it's already in the system, if it was going to cause hyperinflation it would have done so already! So what I'm proposing is that this money is never removed from the system as it should be under QE. The central bank holds maybe 40%+ of a governments debt, it simply says, ""nope I now hold 0% all the debt I held no longer needs to be repaid"".

So government debt has been cut. Who has lost out? The existing bond holders? No, their bonds are still worth what they were yesterday, they haven't lost anything, in fact now the government only has say 60% debt to gdp, the chances of them getting repaid are much higher because the government no longer has to repay the interest on the debt that was wiped out by the central bank.

But you're right in as much as this could only be done once, the government would have to say ""the government debt held by the central bank's QE program is now gone, it will not need to be repaid *and there will be no more QE*"".

It is essentially a reset button you can press once. It will probably work once but it's not something you can do again and again.

And if numerous countries do it at once e.g. USA, UK, Japan, EU (maybe...) then where would people put their money, each country is as equally bad as each other.

Munich is quite expensive so your biggest concern will be to find a flat for a reasonable rent and not the neighborhood. Also Munich is really nice pretty much everywhere.

&gt; Do you see any issues with me meeting people?

Depends on your personality how quickly you'll find friends. But i've learned that when you have talked to a couple of strangers in a foreign country you lose your fear of approaching people and it becomes pretty normal to you (i'm usually very shy). So i don't think you won't have any problems as long as you don't hide in your apartment all day.

&gt; What are the best ways to meet people?

Sports, bars/clubs, flirting anywhere ;)

&gt; How are Americans perceived?

Double-edged sword. Many love everything about America/Americans but there is also a good part of the population that hates the US politics. So people will definatly try to start discussion about it all the time and see if you support the wars etc. 

&gt; What do most young people do for fun?

Summer: hanging around anywhere like Biergarten, parks like Englischer Garten or somewhere in the city center; playing football; going to a lake/pool; partying at the weekends of course.

Winter: Skiing/Snowboarding. Drinking Glühwein at christmas markets :P

&gt; Is it difficult to get to the mountains or elsewhere without a car?

Yes. I think you'd have to try to find somebody with a car or rent one yourself.

What I think will happen is that one of the EU rescue funds will be given a banking license, it will then borrow money from the ECB and use it to buy up the debt of nations in trouble, specifically I'm thinking of Spain and Italy but others as well. The same trick can then be done with this fund, because it borrows its money from the ECB which can just be magicked away, the debt can be forgiven.

Why I say 'about'? Because nobody know the exact number, they are illegal, there is no way to exactly count them! On top of that we have a number of legal immigrants that work and live here, and nobody has a problem with them. Can you imagine the burden on all aspects of the society that this creates? A society already hit by crisis? So yes, what the media 'forget' to inform is that we are talking about illegal immigrants.

Germany was allowed to reunify for standing by the euro, and the devaluation to euro offers them has allowed their exports to grow like crazy.

Lets just say overall what is best for Germany is for the euro to stay intact. If they were to go back to their own currency, their exports will start tanking, and all of the people who didn't wanna help Greece will start losing their jobs.

This puts Germany in a bad position.

One way or another, money will leave Germany and end up in Greece.

How much of any investment is ""sensible"" is a neverending topic of debate between Keynesians and...what's the opposite - disciples of Hayek?  Friedman?

The Americans did a pretty good, fast job jumping in to avoid various industries' collapses - and they've always had pretty good bankruptcy provisions to avoid underperforming companies from just shuttering if there's a chance they'll recover, but the are a ton of other systemic problems.

Hollande is going to face some issues; France simply does not have enough money to pay for everything they want to finance - retirement at 60, comparatively generous social programs, good infrastructure, support for ailing industrial conglomerates, etc.  The challenge is going to be how much of the ""good"" expenditures the country can keep (stuff that drives growth, like a good public education system, well developed transportation infrastructure, etc.) along with expenditures that are luxuries but which would piss off the electorate if they were cut.

And what I meant was that there is a difference between being part and being under the influence of. This is why in my head both Slovenia and Croatia are Balkan/Southern European states. To add another argument to it - both Slovenian and Croatian belong to the Southern branch of the Slavic languages.

&gt; I'm not sure if you're now just trolling or what. You claim that all of Croatia is on the Balkans and then link to a picture that quite clearly shows that half of Croatia isn't even geographically Balkans, including its capital and biggest city. So which one is it now?

I stand corrected. But at the end, both countries are partially on the Balkans.

I guess it is a matter of opinion, so I wouldn't argue further about it. I find it interesting how the perception about ""cultural belonging"" changes.

Io spiego al paziente cos'è la terapia e perché farla. Io NON spiego al paziente cos'è l'omeopatia, e non posso sapere - né voglio sapere - quali siano le balle che hanno detto al paziente per convincerlo a prendere quello che, da quanto ne so io, è praticamente un placebo.

È una decisione informata? Non lo so, io ho fatto del mio meglio per spiegare la terapia. Non posso sapere se, una volta finita la visita, il paziente si mette a googlare per scoprire se esiste un ""rimedio omeopatico"" per la sua malattia o se, peggio ancora in mia opinione, lo stesso paziente va da un omeopata/naturopata/quel-che-è-opata per farsi dare un parere più ""illuminato"". Nel primo caso non è una decisione informata, è l'equivalente di dire ""metto la mano dentro un nido di crotali che tanto non è detto che mi mordano""; nel secondo caso è un modo come un altro di buttare tempo, soldi e soprattutto salute.

PS: ovviamente, il mio è ragionamento da medico che ha studiato per anni per diventare tale. Non capisco l'omeopatia proprio da un punto di vista ""scientifico"", nel senso che non posso concepire la memoria dell'acqua o le diluizioni ""esageratamente esagerate""; la mia opinione è sicuramente di parte.

Edit: ah, e indubbiamente la morte è l'unico evento medico che ha il 100% di probabilità di verificarsi; tuttavia, quando succede qualcosa di ""storto"", e parlo anche qui per esperienza diretta, la denuncia nei confronti del medico è sempre troppo facile.

No answer.

He posted [these](http://www.iefimerida.gr/sites/default/files/voula-papaxristou-welcome-home-123.jpg) tweets as ""evidence"" (evidence for what exactly, I'm not sure).

Let me translate everything for you, in order to put things in context.

* The first one is [the known tweet](http://twitter.com/papaxristoutj/status/227152669129732096) (""with so many Africans in Greece, West Nile's mosquitoes will eat food from home"").

* The second one is [a dogfight video on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1geh_MfaOM), where a Greek pilot ""fights"" a Turkish pilot violating Greek airspace and ""wins"". The title of the video is ""fuck the fucking Turk"". Papachristou's comment (in the tweet) was ""hellenic Air!!!!"", praising [Hellenic Air Force](http://www.haf.gr/en/).

* The third one is linking to a [post](http://xa-stereas.blogspot.gr/2012/06/blog-post_30.html) in Golden Dawn's [Cental Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Greece) chapter's blog, asking locals to fight collectively against bribery and corruption in the local authorities, giving them a phone to report all complaints.

* In the fourth one, she sends her wishes on Golden Dawn's spokesman nameday, telling Ilias Kasidiaris to ""live long, stay healthy and true"".

* In the fifth one, she uploaded a photo of a gun with the phrase [""Molon Labe""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molon_labe) (""come and take them"") engraved.

* Number six is a retweet linking to Kasidiaris' [interview](http://translate.google.gr/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xryshaygh.com%2Findex.php%2Fenimerosi%2Fview%2Fhlias-kasidiarhs-sto-crash-stochos-mas-h-ejousia-kai-h-tha-ginei-twra-h-de&amp;act=url) for Crash magazine, where he says that their objective is to grab power as soon as possible, that he doesn't discriminate between Communists and National Socialists in the workplace, and he jokes with the term ""politician"" (given the negative connotations, as many Greeks blame the ""old guard"" for incompetency). He [also says](http://translate.google.gr/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbeast.gr%2Fgreece%2Farthro%2F383652%2Fkasidiaris-de-me-proseggizoun-mono-ellinides%2F&amp;act=url) (warning: bad Google translation) that non-Greek girls approach him, and that media are biased and don't paint an accurate picture of his party (they reject the term ""Nazis"", they say that they are Greek nationalists and that they would fight against Nazis if they had the opportunity to defend their country).

* Following that, a tweet with a link to an article where Golden Dawn's spokesman asked the government about [Roma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma_in_Greece)'s criminal activites (there are many gangs, usually stealing material used for the railways).

* Another retweet where Kasidiaris announced that they're giving away food for free in a poor neighbourhood.

* Coming up, another link to a blog post saying that when other political party youths are camping, using public money, Golden Dawn's members are helping firefighters.

* In the final tweet, she uploaded a photo with a warning sign saying that ""intruders will be shot and burried here"", a reference to the increased number of violent robberies, where even old women are raped and knocked out over petty sums.

If she makes tasteless jokes, it's one thing. Calling her racist and holding her guilty by alleged association (and for what crime exactly?), without even hearing her side first, it's another. We're talking about something against all democratic principles of a free and fair society.

Fun fact #1: Papachristou was recently a member of a Turkish team, Fenerbahçe. But that's not fitting in other people's narratives, they've already put on their judge wigs and sentenced her.

Fun fact #2: The Hellenic Olympic Committee banned athletes from making ANY comments not related to sports.

true,WhosYourPapa,GREE,Greece,"Well, it all started when Greece first entered the Euro. There was a huge influx of foreign investment as a result of increased freedom in trade, which is the majority of the Greek economy. The Greek economy soars and people start buying things. Specifically, luxury goods. In fact, a phenomenon here is the amount of Porsche sales in Greece immediately after the Euro switch. I don't know why, but Greeks were straight running for Porsche's. Anyway, as people were buying and buying and asking for loan after loan, the banks, with the false perceived support of EU financing, just kept on giving out money. The government in turn, kept on giving *them* money, in order to make everyone happy, so Greek could keep buying their Porsches. The situation here is very similar to the American crisis. The problem, however, was corruption. This is where the familial social ties come into play. The problem is that greek government officials and tax collectors began to realize the growing debt that they thought would magically disappear in a booming economy. Upon seeing the imminent disaster, rather than go and try to fix it, they focused on themselves and their families as opposed to the greater good. Hence, you get tax collectors and government officials going to citizens in the following situation. Mr. Greek owes the government 300,000€. Tax Collector X comes to Mr. Greek and says, ""Ok, you owe the government 300,000€ but I can make that go away if you pay me 150,000€."" Due to a significant lack of efficiency within financial regulatory bodies in Greece and the EU, this was allowed unchecked. Hence, taxes continued to go unpaid, the government was making no money, while government officials didn't care because they were banking millions on the side. All of this because they cared more about themselves and protecting their families than doing what was best for the country. It's disgusting and despicable, but this aspect of Greek culture is one that will never go away. The Greek will always think of himself and his family before country.

So I'm confused by and not only a little skeptical of all these magical processes that create value out of nothing, and that value rests solely on people's belief that it's real. It seems so fragile. I used to instinctively dismiss those weirdos wanting to return back to the gold standard, but what my instincts really should tell me is that that's more logical than the current system.

The main question here: is this a bad thing? Well probably not. The European economies are strangled by debt. Not just government debt but any kind of debt. The effects of this are most visible in the housing market which has come to a complete standstill because nobody can take a loss on their house due to 100% mortgages.

Let's take them one by one.

&gt; 1,450% increase in new HIV infections in Greek drug users 2010-2011

Notice that *this is about drug users, not for the general population*. This is an estimation based on some sample data, after considering that some drug users share needles to save money.

&gt; 63 malaria cases reported last year, the first outbreak in 40 years

You'll find *malaria clusters among illegal immigrants* in all countries ([example](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016778/?tool=pubmed)). They are admitted to the hospitals and treated.

&gt; 25% increase in homelessness in Athens in 2011

This is *true*, because many people are hit hard. Salaries were cut drastically and many people lost their homes because they couldn't afford to pay back their loans. Banks repossessed them, but they can't sell them anywhere. Brilliant strategy: instead of adjusting the repayments, banks offered the ""solution"" to take a new loan, adding interest on the previous amount. Everybody lost.

&gt; 40% increase in suicides in the first half of 2011 compared to 2009

This is the number of reported incidents and *the number could be higher*. The number of suicides is up in all countries where extreme austerity programs take place.

&gt; 70% of people in Achaia province *cannot* afford to buy the drugs prescribed by their doctors, according to a study by the University of Patras

The study is [here](http://translate.google.gr/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ygeianet.gr%2Fkeimeno.php%3Fid%3D29360&amp;act=url). The *people regularly needing drugs* in Achaia *find it difficult* to buy them. Not *all* people.

&gt; 40% cuts in hospital budget

True. This is absurd, because during crises people use the public health facilities, trying to save money.

&gt; 24% rise in admissions to hospitals in 2010 compared with 2009

See previous point. More people use the National Health System, the increased number is expected.

Edit: adding the [economic aspect](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ambroseevans-pritchard/100019006/who-will-hold-the-troika-to-account-for-asphyxiating-greece/).

&gt; Before we all join together to kick the Greeks when they are down, let us be clear why the country has kept missing the targets.

&gt; The Troika (note: EU/ECB/IMF) originally said that Greece' economy would contract by 2.6pc in 2010 under the austerity regime, before recovering with growth of 1.1pc in 2011, and 2.1pc in 2012.

&gt; In fact, Greek GDP has been in an unbroken free-fall. It did not grow last year. It contracted a further 6.9pc, and is now expected to shrink 6.7pc this year.

&gt; This was entirely predictable – and was predicted by many critics – since Greece faced an IMF-style austerity package without the usual IMF cure of devaluation. The Troika's ideology of ""expansionary fiscal contraction"" – which the IMF has to its credit since abjured, but the fanatics in charge still swear by – is breaking a whole society on the wheel.",0,1343317041,null,0,1343324193,0,c5jq2cd,t3_x6r5n,t1_c5jq2cd,t1_c5jo2m9,null,1429475224,24,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,24

The newly rich (νεόπλουτοι) and debt-ridden however is a very recent phenomenon (one that started after the end of the junta maybe? probably more in the A. Papandreou years of ""prosperity"").

What I want to say is that I don't believe that the family ties are the ones that caused the problem but greed, the desire to make easy and quick money, the fear to make true long standing investments, and a corrupt state are more to blame - all these enhanced by the first years of prosperity that you describe - it's a mentality actually. I am sure there are many Greek families that are strongly tied together and at the same time caring for the good of the country (actually they might be the most, the lower and middle class ones that didn't tax evade as much as the higher ups, the politicians, the heads of the public sector and the rich - people with connections - did and still do).

I agree with you about this. Europe, particularly in the past 20 years, has really consolidated itself politically and economincally. The end of the Cold War left Russia as a great power, but certainly nowhere near the importance the Soviet Union had. As a result, America's relationship with Europe became less important due to the lack of a substantial threat to both the US and Europe. China's rise was a long time coming, and is finally forcing American attention in Asia in a major way. Japan, South Korea, Taiwain and other countries are going to become as, if not more, important for American foreign and defense policy in this century than Western Europe was in the last.

Consider for a moment how a fiat currency can very easily become debased if a CB isn't a credible institution and how inflation is partially determined by expected future inflation. As such, QE of the order of magnitude that you've suggested would signal the willingness of the CB to abuse this feature. Banks would see their balance sheets inflate overnight, as the ECB cannot buy directly from sovereigns, meaning that the currency would lose value relative to real goods which in turn would lead to banks asking for higher returns from their loans (sovereign yields would continue increasing in the long-run). That's assuming that this newly printed money wouldn't reach the real economy, but there's no way that excess liquidity of this magnitude wouldn't be passed on to the real economy eventually. Even so, economic agents would consider the precedent that had been set, expecting further measures over time, expecting inflated prices in turn leading to a real increase in inflation.

It's really difficult to avoid providing such a liquidity boost to banks as they are the principal holders of sovereign debt. Short of inflation, economic growth or default there's really not much that can be done to shrink debt-ratios. 

The important thing to note, however, is that if a CB is credible and declares that it will backstop a small enough sovereign (like Greece), then the likelihood of default would fall. In fact, the CB wouldn't even need to print large amounts of money if the markets hold the CB as reliable. Instead, they would expect a higher future rate inflation that can be mitigated with monetary policy anyway. Regardless, since a small economy has a very negligible impact on the overall system, it would be a minimal increase. Unfortunately, this is still debt mutualization and leads to myriad of issues due to perverse incentives, but it still would have been more effective and less costly (assuming that you could correct for the moral hazard in the long-run) than injecting liquidity ad-nauseam as states successively crumble one after another under pressure from fearful investors.

The Dark Ages lasted longer, which can be explained by the 300 year Tatar-Mongol Yoke and other such factors.

Then again, the nobility did get ""infected"" by the ideals of Enlightenment, as demonstrated by the Decembrist Movement and the core of the left-wing radicals responsible for ""The Great October Socialist Revolution"", were middle class intellectuals.

Many of the Bolsheviks were socially liberal to the extreme, declaring ""shame"" to be a Bourgeois value, holding nudist parades on the Red Square (there is video footage), promoting radical gender equality (including unisex bathrooms), advocating orgies, wife-swapping, sexual experimentation and ""free love"" between Komsomoltsy (young wing of the Communist Party), etc. Soviet Russia was also the first major country to legalize abortion. 

Of course, after Stalin muscled his way to total power, he put a stop to all this and purged the people who advocated it. The man was very socially conservative. It can be explained by his Georgian upbringing - Georgia and other Caucasus cultures tend to be very traditionalist, as well as his Orthodox Seminary education.

What our European leaders fail to realize, or try to keep hush hush at the very least, is that the Eurozone is locked in economic warfare with the US. 

What's happening right now in Europe is nothing more than the old ""Divide and Conquer"" strategy being employed by US based financial institutions at the administration beck and call, as a way to divert international attention from their own downward spiral. Sure Greece, Portugal and Spain might need economic and cultural reform, but at least neither of these countries is the state of Michigan. Have you guys seen Detroit? It's so bad it's hilarious.

I just wish every single European realized we're fighting a war of smoke and mirrors with the US. Just because the media say that the euro is going to fail because US rating agencies say we're doomed, doesn't make it so.

Cheap(ish) should be possible, Barcelona is not the most expensive city as far as hotels go.  I recommend not to skimp, as really cheap accommodation in Barcelona *can* be pretty crappy.

Don't have a clue about kid-friendly bars, but *El Bosc de les Fades* might be an option.  Google it, I think you'll like the setting.

Not sure where you're from, but if you're from the US you might never have had alcohol.  Let me start you off and recommend you have a *Clara* at the Bosc bar or any sidewalk cafe.  It's a 50/50 mix of beer and Fanta and it's a surprisingly good drink, especially when it's warm weather.

Museums are awesome in BCN, shame that's not an option.  My favorite thing to do is walk around the El Born and Gothic quarters.
Lots of maze-like streets with shops and eateries.
Most areas connecting to the city center (I generally take Plaça de Catalunya as the center, for ease) are interesting and compact enough to see on foot.

Most upscale shopping can be found in the L'Eixample district, but I tend to prefer the smaller shops.

The Barceloneta area is at the beach and has lots of chiringuitos that serve good food.

More good food at the tiny eateries in the food market La Boqueria.
But you don't give any clues what you like, so it's difficult to give a good recommendation.  I can start recommending awesome places that serve rabbit brain souffle and tripe soup, but if you start shaking uncontrollably at the thought alone, that's not much use.

true,Britzer,BERL,Berlin,"Guck mal. Alle diese einzelnen Ereignisse lassen sich auch aus anderen Gründer erklären. Generell ist es doch so, dass es im Kalten Krieg für beide Seiten um globale Dominanz ging. Um jedes einzelne Land. Egal ob es jetzt Pivot oder privat war. Die NATO hat sich nach Osten ausgebreitet, weil die ehemaligen Satellitenstaaten unbedingt eigentständig in ihrer Innenpolitik werden wollten. Diesem Pivot-Quatsch liegt noch die Territorien-Denke der Kollonialmächte zugrunde. Seitdem ist viel Wasser den Rhein hinab geflossen. Und es geht inzwischen um Rohstoffe, bzw. den Zugang zu diesen. Zum Beispiel ums Öl. Darum drehen sich aktuelle globale Strategien. Welthandel zum Beispiel. Handelsstraßen usw. Und der Zugang zu Rohstoffen. Aber Außenpolitik wird nicht von einem einzigen Thema beherrscht, sondern von ganz verschiedenen Beweggründen und Akteuren. Also nicht alleine von militärischen oder globalstrategischen Erwägungen. Diese eindimensionale Sicht ist so beschränkt wie die Meinung, es würde den Amerikanern in Syrien nur um Menschenrechte gehen. Deshalb habe ich mich darüber so lustig gemacht. 

""Hey, die sind doof, die denken Hitler ist in Russland einmarschiert, weil er Moskau einnehmen wollte. Wie naiv. Ich weiß es viel besser. Er ist einmarschiert, weil er Sankt Petersburg einnehmen wollte.""

Das ist doch beschränkt. Beides (globale strategische Erwägungen einer Supermacht und die Menschenrechte) spielen gewiss eine Rolle in Syrien. Aber erstens keine besonders große und zweitens ist Pivot doch längst vergessen.

Und natürlich ist eine Militärbasis für die Russen überall interessant. Warum nicht im Mittelmeer? Aber genauso nett würden die Russen eine Basis in Venezuela finden. Ich bin sogar davon überzeugt, dass sie jederzeit tauschen würden. Jedoch haben die Amis Südamerika zu ihrem Hinterhof erklärt und würden das nie zulassen. Strategisch günstige Positionen werden immer gerne übernommen. Aber auch das hat stark an Bedeutung verloren. Erst durch strategische Nuklearwaffen Mitte des 20. Jahrhundert. Seitdem führen Supermächte keine ernsthaften Kriege mehr. Nur noch Stellvertreterkriege. Und jetzt haben wir nicht nur B2-Bomber, die praktisch überall starten können und UBoot-Interkontinentalraketen, die aufgrund verbesserter Genauigkeit keine Nuklearsprengköpfe mehr benötigen. Wozu braucht man noch Stützpunkte, wenn man jeden Punkt der Erde von überall aus mit beliebiger Munition und Genauigkeit angreifen kann. Mit Hilfe der Uboot-Raketen innerhalb von 30 Minuten, wenn notwendig. Mit Hilfe der B2 mit beliebiger Munition und Genauigkeit und fast unbegrenzter Menge. 

Die Drohne hat schließlich endgültig die Kriegführung revolutioniert. Nicht, weil es weniger gefährlich ist, sondern weil sie so lange in der Luft bleiben kann. So kann man seine Drohnen starten lassen, wo man will (Landbasis wieder egal, in Afghanistan gerne näher, aber nicht notwendig) und sie bleiben tagelang über dem Zielgebiet und können aufklären. 

Mal davon abgesehen, dass sich ein erheblicher Teil des Handel und des Krieges zwischen Nationen ins Internet verlagert hat.

Und schließlich dass Nationen stark an Bedeutung verloren haben. Internationale Konzerne, NGOs und staatliche Verbände wie die EU entscheiden heute.

Natürlich stört es die Amis ein wenig, wenn die Russen eine Basis in Syrien haben. Die Bedeutung in diesem Krieg ist jedoch zu vernachlässigen. Abgesehen vom verletzten Stolz der ehemaligen Supermacht Russland, welche aus Angst den Stützpunkt zu verlieren im Sicherheitsrat blockiert. Die trauern altem Glanz und Gloria nach. Und so hat diese Basis wesentlich mehr Bedeutung für Russland als für die USA. Und selbst wenn es um diese Basis gehen würde. Und damit um regionale (**nicht globable**!!) strategische Erwägungen, hätte das doch nichts mit einer verspinnerten, alten Theorie zu tun, bei der eine Macht von innen heraus alle Seehäfen Eurasiens kontrolliert und somit England nicht mehr anlegen kann.",0,1343328595,null,0,false,0,c5jtik8,t3_x4edc,t1_c5jtik8,t1_c5jpdls,null,1429476935,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

And what I imagine happening, is that eventually once sufficient countries have managed to make enough reforms this ""reset"" switch would be thrown. With significantly smaller national debts and hence less interest bills to pay it should be enough to get economies kick started again.

Well, I mean... This year, I was in Cannes in February and had a [great weather](http://i.imgur.com/GpODNh.jpg), so it also depends on where you go.

I saw you had a rental car, manual, take mandatory care that you 1) know how to drive it as most of you guys have automatics, 2) have a compatible license. That done, it's the best way to discover France, lots of time will be spent driving, but it's easier than taking trains, cheaper than taking planes and you're free to go around while on location.

In three weeks you have time to see a lot of things, plan your trip well before leaving and you'll have the best experience, no matter the weather.
If you come during the christmas season, I'll just advise you to go at least to Strasbourg, and Alsace in a general matter, to enjoy Christmas markets and all the spirit around it. Follow the wine road, see the small typical villages, try the food specialties (lard and cheese bretzel with hot spiced orange juice in first place), go to Mont Sainte-Odile and Haut-Koenigsbourg. Even a shitty weather won't ruin such an experience, it would even make it better.

true,Britzer,BERL,Berlin,"&gt; Schön, du hast jetzt einige Punkte aufgezählt, teils berechtigte, teils etwas vereinfacht, die geeignet sind, außenpolitische Entscheidungen mit zu beeinflussen.

Besonders genervt hat an dem Artikel, dass die Pivot-Theorie angeblich **der** Kriegsgrund der Westalliierten im zweiten Weltkrieg war. Und alles andere dagegen Bedeutungslos. Absoluter Oberschwachsinn. 

&gt; Ich erspare es mir auf jeden einzeln einzugehen aus Lust- und Zeitgründen.

Du hast bisher noch nicht mal kohärent irgend etwas geschrieben, was darauf hindeuten könnte wie die Pivot-Theorie mit der Position der Amerikaner in Syrien in Einklang zu bringen ist. Nach dem einfachen Prinzip.

1. Was ist jetzt?

2. Was sind die langfristigen Ziele (was ist Pivot konkret in Syrien)?

2. Wie sollen diese mit konkreten kurzfristigen Zielen und Plänen in Einklang gebracht werden?

3. Und wie sollen diese kurzfristigen Schritte umgesetzt werden. Was machen die Amis also momentan und warum und was werden sie demzufolge in naher Zukunft machen.

Das einzige was Du geschrieben hast war: Clinton mault herum und Skagerrak ist irgenwie wichtig. Nichts bisher in halbwegs nachvollziehbarer Form.

Dazu passt auch, dass Du behauptest, dass Dir votes Dir angeblich egal sind, Du aber trotzdem jedes Mal davon gebrauch machst. 

&gt; Ich möchte mich einfach nochmals wiederholen, dass keiner der Punkte aus Sicht der Verfechter dieser Theorie inkompatibel mit dieser ist.

Das ist das schöne an nebulösen Welterklärungs-Theorien. Vor allen Dingen, wenn sie so schön flexibel sind wie eine, die von Finnland nach Korea geht und diese Region einfach mal als eine (Rim) zusammenfasst. Da passt einfach alles dazu und nichts. Und so hat sie eben Bedeutung für alles und nichts. Vor allen Dingen für zweiteres.

&gt; Die Durchhaltefähigkeit von Drohnen über den Einsatzräumen ist nicht ""tagelang"" 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle#Endurance

Du redest von Quark der vor 100 Jahren seine Bedeutung verloren hat. OK, die aktuellen Reaper haben nur 14 Studen, also je nachdem wie lange sie für Hin- und Zurück brauchen also nur 12 Studen über dem Zielgebiet. Aber das geht gerade radikal nach oben. Ich habe einen militärischen Trend beschrieben, der sich innerhalb dieses Jahrzehnts vollzieht. Aufgrund der sehr geringen Kosten dieser Flugapperate ist dieser Trend wesentlich globaler als viele andere ""Revolutionen"" des Krieges. Ein Vergleich mit einem Kampfjet, der vielleicht ein paar Minuten Zeit hat, gibt es jedenfalls nicht.

&gt; Drohnen haben den Streitkräften keine grundsätzlich neuen Fähigkeiten gebracht. 

Das Internet hat auch keine grundsätzliche neuen Fähigkeiten gebracht. Es hat nur die Kommunikation vereinfacht. Kommunikation gab es schon vorher. Auch das verbilligen von Kriegen ist eine Revolution. Nur die billigen Waffen aus den Lagern des ehemaligen Warschauer Paktes ermöglichten viele Konflikte Anfang der 90er Jahre in Afrika.

If you take an AP econ class, you've taken Econ 101, and then you know that the current problem *all over the Western world* is aggregate demand. As a person who works shipping products, I can tell you, this is the truth. We have enough workers and we are efficient enough, but nobody wants what anybody is selling.

The problem in Europe is that the Euro is a strangehold on the economy of Greece, which should be able to depreciate its way to economic growth but can't.

Most economists think that the EU needs to go for some inflation- this lets Spain, Portugal, Greece, etc. lower the costs of doing business inside of their countries and thereby make them more efficient. Idiot economists want to do what Ireland is trying to do- internal devalation- which is essentially internal wage cuts. Of course, sticky wages stop that from happening.

The problem with Euro-inflation is that Germany doesn't want it. It would be bad for Germany, destroy some of its savings, and over-heat it as people begin spending more there. 

tl;dr: QE Europe is not going to happen. Stop focusing so much on government debt. Private debt and aggregate demand are the problems.",0,1343335936,null,0,false,0,c5jvr2g,t3_x6n11,t1_c5jvr2g,t3_x6n11,null,1429478010,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

What is the traditional way to break aggregate demand problem?

Government (Keynesian) spending coupled with lower taxes and very loose monetary policy.

Why don't we do that? Because government debt is already high and projected to get higher. Politics doesn't allow significant extra borrowing under such circumstances because quite rightly the borrowing levels are already perceived to be very high.

The ""recoveries"" in the UK and USA are much lower than after a normal recession, we should have had 5%+ yearly gdp growth, we got no where near. In the UK they're talking about ten years of ""austerity"" before we ""recover"".

So how do you stimulate aggregate demand under such circumstances? You tell me.
