true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; Isn't it a bit absurd though? That central banks of countries offer 1% interest rates to private banks, while governments pay a much higher interest rate back to the private market?

There are many differences between those two scenarios. First of all, central banks aren't profit oriented. For them, it's just a means to control the money supply, they set rates to achieve a certain desired effect. If they want to increase the money supply, they give away credit a low rates.  
Another reason is that banks have to provide security for those loans, while governments do not. Greece just had a default worth €100bn. When a bank defaults, the central bank is mildly inconvenienced by having to sell the bonds that the bank had secured their loan with themselves.

It's the same when you try to get a loan from your bank.

The closest meaning in English I can find is ""Not to loose your face"" or ""To loose your face"". How others see you is very important for an average Italian.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I'm not sure what to think of it. I don't actually have a problem with a national ID card, probably because I'm already used to having one (Germany). But there are certain things I'm a bit uneasy about, specifically how easy verification over the Net might make it more commonplace over the years. Imagine you'll have to confirm your identity each time you register an account somewhere. I don't like this thought at all.  
I'm less worried about data security, and the fingerprints are opt-out. I generally don't like biometric data.

There are a couple of features that I actually like, especially how it can generate a UID for each domain name. This is one-way, i.e., there is no way to get from the UID to your identity, but if you lose your ID card the replacement one will still generate the same UID for the same domain. For password management, this is great.

What I also like is how confirmation is solved. A service provider must justify the necessity to get a key for verification, but this will only be for the relevant data. Say, a porn site needs age verification.

On the gender on the net issue.

I appreciate being able to talk about it with a girl calmly, thank you. Fact is that in French when a girl writes, her spelling bears marks of her gender, that's a rule learned from the very early age and is enforced in regular correspondence. Person in question wrote without using those marks, then became angry at someone who responded addressing her as a male, I invited her to rewrite her OP after checking several of her posts in other subs, at her refusal called her a hypocrite, shitstorm ensued...

Regardless of the gender if one is polite IRL he/she is also on the net and he/she speaks in an identical way to both genders, without making a distinction. On the receiving end it depends on how a given person identifies himself (hey, should I put that him/herself?), I will take taking offence for being addressed as the wrong gender as sign of some agenda issue (cross gender, feminist, other).",0,1335252058,null,0,false,0,c4fwlf9,t3_segkn,t1_c4fwlf9,t1_c4f3kax,null,1428784384,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

The real estate bubble is the number one problem here - lots of Northern Europeans descend on the Costas  each year for their holidays and increasingly they bought properties. All well and good, but far too many poor quality properties were being built and the bursting of this bubble has left a lot of Spanish banks holding either a lot of debt that wont be serviced or properties that are next to worthless.

This coupled with the collapse in construction has meant that an awful lot of jobs have gone. Spain, particularly the south, has always had a high structural unemployment because of the labour laws. I know from personal experience that the goal of many Spaniards in places like Andalucia is to geta cushy job with the government where they get a relatively high wage and very little to do.

Small businesses are often highly proteceted (e.g. Pharmacies) or they struggle. Even before the crisis unemployment in Andalucia was in the 15-20% range. The main industry of that region I think is farming and tourism.

The Spanish government was remarkably well behaved and had not run up masses of debt, but bailing out the banks has cost them dearly.

Si tu le sors du reste du programme, c'est sur que c'est plus dur de le défendre... Tiens je te sors un petit extrait d'un article de Mediapart qui s'intéresse a la question (http://www.mediapart.fr/journal/economie/160412/autour-du-smic-le-clivage-gauche-gauche) : 

&gt;Economiste proche de Mélenchon, Jacques Généreux rappelle que le Smic avait été augmenté de 35 % lors des accords de Grenelle en mai 1968. Et précise que cette mesure ne peut pas être analysée indépendamment du reste du programme du Front de gauche. « Nous proposons un programme global qui rompt avec l’austérité de la droite et l’austérité douce de François Hollande. Nous nous plaçons dans une perspective de relance radicale de l’activité de l’emploi, de progrès écologique et social. »
&gt;
&gt;D'après l'économiste, la crise financière est d'abord une crise de la « sous-rémunération du travail, qu'on a voulu compenser par l'endettement » des ménages comme des États. La hausse du Smic, qui profiterait aussi selon lui à « un million et demi de salariés se situant au-dessus », participerait donc d'une vaste relance par les salaires.
&gt;
&gt;Jacques Généreux juge que la mesure pourrait coûter « 10 à 15 milliards » aux entreprises.

Austerity is the cure of the sickness of printing money. Some countries will manage fine, others will suffer... go [check the rates of some of the national currencies before they joined the euro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currencies_of_the_European_Union#Historic_currencies)

It seems to me, the higher number they need to exchange to the euro, the worse austerity is gonna be for them, because at the first sign of danger, they just printed money and pretended it was all good.

So we can either make them go back to their currency and laugh while they remain poor, or we can help them fix the problems which cause them to always screw up no matter what currency they have.

In NYC, they would be homeless. They'd need assistance or rent control. They'd also make higher wages, but pay far more for everything. Food, especially. 

I try to explain to people that NYC has nothing to do with the rest of the state, nor most of the nation. In NYC, people pay $5k/mo for a mortgage. In Buffalo, you could buy a house for what someone pays in a month in the city. 

NYC really needs it's own currency. One currency for the nation doesn't make sense. That was always my problem with the Euro. It wasn't going to help the poor as much as the rich. Wages go up, but inflation destroys real gains. 

Again, upstate NY. People are underpaid, relative to other places. But they still do alright. You can have less money and still get value. It's why Germany dominates. They are like NYC.

Democracy is good because it is the least arbitrary authority we have so far imagined — liberal humanism is good because it allows for some balance between individual freedom without compromising social responsibility.

While there are authoritarian antidemocratic forces on what we usually call the ""left"" wing, the authoritarian forces on the ""right"" wing are currently much more vocal and influential.

""Liberal"" government works as long as people don't have to have solidarity with each other i.e. low taxes, little welfare - basically you do what you want, but you also bear the consequences.

""Socialism"" can also work but only if it is ""authoritarian"": if the market incentives do not regulate the people's choices because the government decides who gets what, then the government must tell everybody what to do.

Now IMHO the last 50 years of Western Europe is the policy of ""headless"" giants: ""liberal"" - because it allows people to live the way they want to - yet ""socialist"" - because the tax/redistribute system takes away the consequencs of people's choices. So  it is pretty much the worst of both worlds.

So in this regard the ""liberal""-""authoritarian"" axis does not make that much sense. Our typical governments tell us what we get but not what to do - that is neither liberal nor authoritarian, merely foolish.

*So both ""liberal"" and ""authoritarian"" systems balance responsibility for others with authority over others. The liberal balance is little authority over others, little responsibility over others. The authoritarian socialist balance is a lot of responsibility over others, solidarity, hence a lot of authority over others.*

*But our crazy modern European system is all about full responsibility and solidarity for othrs but not authority over them.* This makes no sense. Ýou are forced to pay money to others yet you cannot force them to spend it the way you want them to. This is utterly weird and crazy but this is our current reality.

Example: Muslim immigration. 

A ""liberal"" government would have no problem with it but it would also give no welfare to them, basically let them live, die, succeed or suffer, come here or get disillusioned and move home, as they want to. But their lives would not affect the future of the native people. Taxes would be low and everybody would be saving money for his own retirement / pension / social security.

Or an ""authoritarian socialist"" government would give welfare, but also would demand integratetion, good behavior or else get kicked out.

Now we have this ""liberal socialist"" kind of governments, where the Muslims can immigrate, get welfare, nobody tells them to behave or GTFO, it is not sure at all whether their kids will be forced to learn the working ethic with wich to earn money and to pay my pension when I am old, yet I cannot save up for my own pension because I am taxed an arm and leg to pay for their welfare. So I have to to responsibility for them but I have no authority over them. It is not ""liberal"" and not ""authoritarian"".

&gt;Why not?

I don't understand the question. Isn't it obvious? Responsibility for others means I am not completely free relative to them, but owe them something. This is based on need. Given that justice means keeping things in balance and in proportion, a proper balance is gaining authority: getting to tell people to behave in ways that removes that need hence removes my obligation. Putting it in other words, if it is not my fault that others have problems, because I have no authority over them, then I also owe them nothing, no matter how much they suffer, hence no responsibility for others. This is what I mean a sensible balance and it is just so obvious to me I don't get why I even have to explain it... people think like this in everyday situations all the time, just for some weird reason not in politcs.

&gt;I think you're confusing ""liberal"" with ""libertarian"" — they're two quite distinct things, although philosophically related.

My point is that only libertarian liberalism works, because it properly balances the lack of authority with the lack responsibility.

Abgesehen davon ist die Vergütungsproblematik viel tiefergehend, als hier dargestellt. Ein Click kostet je nach Keyword, Sprache, Land usw. unterschiedlich viel Geld - CPC nennt man das.
Google will jedoch in Deutschland mit Anzeigen mehr Geld verdienen pro Click als der Ukraine. Der CPC in .de liegt deutlich höher aufgrund des BIPs. Trotzdem will Google aber die selbe Künstlervergütung rausrücken wie in Ländern mit niedrigerem CPC.

In favor of Barcelona: 

- Both cities have beautiful and ugly parts but Barcelona is probably more beautiful overall. 
- More civilized climate. Madrid can be a little extreme in summer (104F/40C is not rare) and cold in winter.
- Sea!
- People is more accessible and talkative. Madrid's people can sometimes be somewhat ""dry"", a little like Newyorkers. That doesn't mean that they don't like you, it's just that speaking with a random person is rarer in Madrid (except for taxi drivers).
- More foreigners partying (that could be good or bad), in some parts of the city the people partying is 90% foreigners.
- Easier girls (SORRY IF SOMEBODY IS OFFENDED BY THIS, THAT'S MY EXPERIENCE :D)

In favor or Madrid:

- The architecture is, IMHO, more impressive, more ""imperial"", both the classic architecture and the skyscrapers.
- More foreigners living there, not tourists. 
- Easier to party in places with locals. 
- Less humidity (depending on where you are, this can be good or bad).

Perhaps the europeans decided they don't really care what the markets think and will do whatever is needed to work out the problems of the eurozone -- which covers the part of ""cannot continue to exist, *at least in its present form*"".

From your perspective, you see europeans and british trolls such as myself ""circlejerking"" about keeping the euro alive.

From the european perspective, you get exactly the same feeling from people ""circlejerking"" about the death of the euro.

For whatever reason, the collective of our leaders believe it's worth sticking together no matter what. One of the things that people keep saying is that if countries turned back to their own currencies, they have much more room to maneuver through the problems. A lot of the economists, some of which happen to be germans who studied what happened in their country the last time they went on a print-fest, have come to the conclusion that by doing this, a lot of inflation is created and it takes quite a while to start seeing the symptoms.

The UK, along with the US, were some of the countries which started printing money into their economies to counter the recession. It is now entirely possible that the UK economy will start going through the very same sickness that the eurozone started going through a couple of years ago. So ask yourself, if the UK is not in the eurozone and their economy is doomed to the same fate, why is this whole thing the euro's fault? From a critical thinking perspective, it's very possible that due to the ECB being more open and honest about the problems going on, they got punished by the markets, while the other central banks just played stupid and gave the illusion of stability for a while.

To be honest, we live in very interesting times and a lot of things happening right now have never really happened before (due to the way the world has become more globalized). It's entirely possible that the eurozone is doing the only right thing right now, but **only time will tell who was right**.

So if we keep this circlejerk bullshit up long enough to see the UK economy suffer the same fate as the eurozone and even the mighty british pound couldn't stop it from happening, doesn't that make the euro innocent? What will it take for people to stand up and say ""the system is screwed""? When the US suffers the same fate?

Is it possible that this problem has nothing to do with the euro, but with the global finance system instead? You can circlejerk that the euro caused it of course, but that won't change anything if the whole system is screwed. Or is it not possible for you to consider the possibility that your view may not be entirely correct? If that is the case, it's entirely possible that the BOE is giving the british pound a slow and painful death, ensuring that you join the eurozone yourselves in a few years, but that's just bullshit circlejerk propaganda to your ears, because you cannot possibly be wrong :)

The european leaders have my respect for sticking around and trying to find a way to fix this problem together instead of breaking apart on the first of many bumps to come in the long future ahead of us. +10 points for teamwork. -10 points to the cowards who would jump off the ship the moment they suspect something bad might happen.

How about you guys stop circlejerking just because you hate anything EU and just help us fix the problems behind the euro in a way that makes everyone happy?

They are legally required to ask for information like name and address, but especially the cheap resellers tend to be content with a plausibility test. So, the street and house number should exist at the postal code you enter.  
If you don't care about the cost, you can avoid having to fill out a (German) Web form by walking into one of those old-timey brick-and-mortar stores. They (have to) take the verification seriously, so you'll need to bring your passport. All four network providers will have several in the pedestrian area of the city center. Best networks are T-mobile (magenta, €5/day, 1GB) and Vodafone (red, €10/month for 200MB, another €10 for another 200MB), O2 is a cost/network compromise (blue, €3.50/day, 1GB), eplus is cheap but should still work fine in and around the city (mint green, €10/15/20/month for 500MB/1GB/5GB).  

T-mobile also has a cheap brand, Congstar, that uses the same network but that you have to activate online. Probably fitting for you would be their 1GB option for €13/month. O2 does the same with Fonic (€2.50/day, 500MB). As if this wasn't enough, there's a plethora of virtual networks, those resellers like the aforementioned Blue, Simyo and Nettokom. Practically all supermarket chains have their own, hell, you could walk into a coffee chain like Tschibo and they might turn out to be a mobile phone provider. Some charge an arm and a leg for calls to the US, most charge 9ct/minute, Vodafone has an option where it costs 5ct/minute or so. But if cost is less of an issue, I'd probably just walk into a T-mobile store, at €5/day this only amounts to €35 for that one week. I don't like them (I know T-mobile is the cool underdog in the US, but over here it's the former state monopoly), but it's the best network and it's the simplest solution if you don't want to deal with online activation.

I *think* that somewhere among what we call the ""tarif jungle"" over here is one provider that has a half-decent option to get at least some data volume for France, but since you'll do prepaid anyway I'd just discard of the SIM and get a new one there. Free.fr is good and cheap, but I don't think they have physical stores, so best ask in [/r/France](/r/France) about what to get.

There are are other questions on there where, if you add a some *very* specific situation then they, too, are grammatical.  

It's like when you take a test and you are about 75% sure on an answer, but you second guess yourself and change the answer, but then when you get it back you see that the answer you changed it from was the correct one.

Ist die Tötung eines Wirbeltieres ohne Betäubung im Rahmen weidgerechter Ausübung der Jagd oder auf Grund anderer Rechtsvorschriften zulässig oder erfolgt sie im Rahmen zulässiger Schädlingsbekämpfungsmaßnahmen, so darf die Tötung nur vorgenommen werden, wenn hierbei nicht mehr als unvermeidbare Schmerzen entstehen.

3 In 2009 as an expat to work on a project. Was still employed in Germany. 
4 The cars - they were everywhere! The straight streets and same looking houses. The lack of public transport. The amount of obese people!!!! That every day in my town a person got shot... That people no matter how stupid or clearly deranged can posess a gun was a major WTF! On my first weekend I went to Cosco and freaked when I saw the size of the genetic manipulated veggies. I told my colleague that there's a direct correlation to that 10 year old in the corner who is taller than me and 4 times as big.


4 In work related situations was that I always seemed to offend my colleagues by proposing a strategy or idea that the mother company had proven to work. It was my job to tell them how we optimized the process in Germany because they needed to save budget and learn to work more efficient to save their jobs. Mind you it was the middle of the crisis and though I was sent there so that nobody had to leave, in their social circle massive amounts of people lost their job. It was painful and shocking for me to see how many family members in other companies were let go. Most shocking that they had to leave within a week and didn't get severance or any sort of compensation. 
Another thing that was my pet hate was conducting meetings with the different departments. Instead of preparing the meeting with solutions, they had their coffee and used the meeting to repeat the last meeting that had finished and then continued discussing the problem. This even though it was clearly stated before and with heaps of time to come up solutions. I thought they were horribly inefficient and that it's just something they never learnt to do in school. 

In private situations I couldn't handle the fake friendliness or that every Jew  immediately treated me with negative curiosity. 
Generally the non-existing environmential responsibility was a big shock.

5 Finding real friends was hard. Everybody seemed to have an agenda or some sort of motive to benefit from me as the trophy German friend. The easiest was probably shopping and gaining weight :)


6 During my year there, I talked to friends and family daily. Just for the sake of sanity and to remind myself that I am ""normal"".

7) I moved back as soon as I could. I will never, ever move to the US. I even passed on a ridiculous good job in NY recently.
8) -
9) Beer drinking seems like a national sport there ;) Heidi Klum was quite hot at the time and Inglorious Basterds had just come out.
By the way I didn't think that movie was worth German tax money and I again offended people because I dared to say I felt offended by it. 
10) Nobody else from my family lived there
11) I missed most the benefit of being in a country where you know all the rules by heart, where your common sense is actually the norm.

&gt; Perhaps the europeans [...] 

""The europeans"" - er, I believe we're in the EU and therefore each of us should have some say or other. If you mean the elites however then we'll come to them again in a bit.

&gt; [...] decided they don't really care what the markets think and will do whatever is needed to work out the problems of the eurozone -- which covers the part of ""cannot continue to exist, at least in its present form"".

Deciding that the markets dont matter is a very big step primarily because you're saying that the rules of the game are changing and nobody likes that kind of uncertainty. Had the leaders of the EU come up with and communicated alternatives to the populace then people could respond accordingly.

They have not done this. They have muddled through with one poorly thought out plan after another. This might be more understandably were not these flaws evident to pretty much anyone who bothers to read and understand what is going on.

The situation in Greece was a time bomb waiting to happen, it was never a case of ""if Greece goes bust"" it was a case of ""when Greece goes bust"" but the leaders refused to acknowledge this and buried their heads in the sand.

Equally German insistence on austerity is isnane and driven purely by German fears of inflation and nto on the circumstances of the countries in question. Spain being the obvious case.

So, I put it to you what alternative systems/forms are the EUcrats putting forward that are really addressing the underlying problems?

&gt; For whatever reason, the collective of our leaders believe it's worth sticking together no matter what.

Again why? What is the basis of this belief? Many people believe in many crazy things that does not make those beliefs valid.

&gt; happened in their country the last time they went on a print-fest, have come to the conclusion that by doing this, a lot of inflation is created and it takes quite a while to start seeing the symptoms.

I doubt anyone is suggesting that the central banks go on a printing spree like the Germans did in the 30s but it should not be a hard concept to grasp that a currency union cannot survive with out a poltiical union. History is littered with examples of failed currency unions.

The dollar survives for the US because there are fiscal transfers the like of which we are sort of seeing in Europe. If the euro is to survive we need to accept that this will be part and parcel of life and get on with it.

However, it is **not** the only solution, a nation handling its own economic policies can survive too. There is so little realistic debate then is it any wonder that people within the EU feel that it is increasingly autocratic.

&gt; The UK, along with the US, were some of the countries which started printing money into their economies to counter the recession. It is now entirely possible that the UK economy will start going through the very same sickness that the eurozone started going through a couple of years ago.

This is a slightly more sophisticated economc argument but in basic terms a country printing money to reflate and support banks will kick off economic growth since banks and institutions have money to invest. This does happen magically overnight but any public company with too much money on its balance sheet generally ends up either investing it or handing it back to shareholders.

Yes, it could go wrong and it may well do so. But the levers of control are mostly within the power of those interested in maintaining stability.

&gt; if the UK is not in the eurozone and their economy is doomed to the same fate, why is this whole thing the euro's fault?

The UK being in or out of the Eurozone would not have changed the outcome, indeed we'd probably be in a similar situation to Spain right now. 

&gt; From a critical thinking perspective, it's very possible that due to the ECB being more open and honest about the problems going on

uhm...do you read much of what is put out? The ECB is terrible at communicating what is going on. The Fed, BOJ and BOE are much more open and clearer about what is going on and they have a lot more practical independance from the states they are the lender of last resort for. If the ECB says anything out of line it quickly gets slapped in to place.

&gt; only time will tell who was right.

This is not wholly true, you can make educated guesses, yes it is a guess but the range of outcomes can be predicted with varying degrees of accuracy. It is not quite a science but it is not blind either. 

&gt; So if we keep this circlejerk bullshit up long enough to see the UK economy suffer the same fate as the eurozone and even the mighty british pound couldn't stop it from happening, doesn't that make the euro innocent?

It's not about the pound being mighty or not, and the euro is ""guilty"" of nothing in particular. The ""guilt"" is that a lot of bad, short-sighted decisions were taken 10-20 years ago and politicians have publicly derided anyone who dared speak against the euro-jerk. 

The global crisis which began in 2008 was not directly caused by the euro and I doubt anyone is saying it is, but the inconsistencies and poor economic management of member countries is exacerbating the crisis not just for Europe but for the world at large. 

If Italy or Spain were to default it would be a major event quite possibly leading to a proper depression 30s style and Germany is playing chicken a bit too much.

&gt; If that is the case, it's entirely possible that the BOE is giving the british pound a slow and painful death, ensuring that you join the eurozone yourselves in a few years, but that's just bullshit circlejerk propaganda to your ears, because you cannot possibly be wrong :)

I'm not claiming that in the slightest, neither do I fully understand your point. How does a currency die a slow painful death?  Joining the Eurozone would solve no major problems for the UK. It would create quite a few though. By all means make a case for joining.

&gt; The european leaders have my respect for sticking around and trying to find a way to fix this problem together

Blindly sticking to something come what may should not be respected. What should be respected is coming up with a realistic plan, communicating that plan and changing it if needs be. Being a bunch of arrogant fools is not worthy of respect.

&gt; How about you guys stop circlejerking just because you hate anything EU and just help us fix the problems behind the euro in a way that makes everyone happy?

I'm not anti-Europe quite the contrary the older I get the more I appreciate EU culture. However, I am not blind to its faults and until these things get seriously addressed (CAP for example) then frankly you're pissing in the wind. 

I would love to be pro-european but I'm not pro-european for the same reason that I am not a Catholic. I've read what has been put forward and I find it a rather laughable fantasy. 

&gt; but I believe in the European project as well.

ECB reveals undisclosed billions of extra bank aid

Use of emergency liquidity assistance by eurozone banks could be considerably higher than previously thought. That is the conclusion I draw from a change today in European Central Bank reporting procedures.

If I am right, it could be that a bank (or several banks) somewhere in the eurozone is (are), in effect, being bailed out by national authorities. Fingers will inevitably point to Spain.

The mistake people often make is to conflate a study of Nazi (or any other nasty, extremist) symbolism and ideology with an approval of the ideology's message.  But for any serious student of history, psychology, sociology, economics, political science, and any number of other fields in the humanities, it's important as a work of context.

_Mein Kampf_ is a rant full of nonsensical claptrap - in terms of total lack of literary quality or coherency, I'd rank it up there with the _Rukhnama_ or Qaddafi's _Green Book_, but unlike those two, it essentially codified a set of beliefs, no matter how silly or objectionable, that served as the basis for one of the major upheavals to have shaped our modern world. 

I mean, here you had a significant percentage of the population one of the most powerful, civilized, established, mainstream countries in existence at the time - people who really ought to have known better - and they _ate that shit up_.  Even in the context of the arguably less evolved political and social thought of the 1920s and 1930s, _Mein Kampf_ is gobbledygook.  So how did this fringe group of idiots go from 60 members in 1920, to ~130k in 1929, to winning almost 40% of the 1932 Reichstag elections?  I mean, surely _some_ of the people voting for these thugs must have read this garbage before?  And surely some of the people who read it, and still voted for them, must have understood that it was, in fact, garbage?

It's really important to understand how these things develop, and the combination of ideology, history, and situation that allows them to develop.  

On a personal note, I grew up in a _really_ catholic farm village.  The amount of social pressure on children to be religious and conform to some really backward ideas was enormous.  My parents, who are both fairly enlightened, educated people, forced me to attend church and to go through all the stupid rigmarole - just to make sure that religion would _never_ be an attractive mystery for me as I grew up, and that I could make an informed choice.

If she feels there's a demand for social programs, etc, she has not hesitation to implement them, even if they are against core conservative values). 

Another reason why she's relatively popular is simply that many, perhaps a majority of Germans, feel (but not necessarily say) that she handles the crisis reasonably well: to put it shortly, most voters seem to feel that Germany should share some of the financial burden of the crisis, but has done enough already, and now is the time of the indebted nations to cut down their budgets.

I'm neither trying to condone it, nor condemn it).

Can't really help you with Barcelona, but here is my advice for Seville and Granada.
In Seville there are things you just must see like the Cathedral or the Real Alcazar(in my opinion more impressive than the cathedral). For a great view of the cathedral you should go to one of these two hotel terraces, hotel M or hotel doña maria, the first one is more expensive, and the views are pretty similar, even better from doña maria. 
I don't know your budget, but in Seville eating is not really expensive, I must say that Spanish bars can be a shock to some. The best ones are not the ones that look like starbucks but actually the ones that are ""worst looking"" Just saying don't turn away the bars full of old guys with napkins and olive bones on the floor they normally have the best food around.(yes, we trough paper napkins and that kind of stuff to the floor, that way the bar tender only get back dishes and are faster serving, now and then a waiter brooms the floor) 
I'll recommend two opposites and you can chose, ""La saeta"" is a little bar very authentic and really cheap, everything is delicious. The other one is ""modesto"" a high end, old fashion restaurant with extraordinary jamon and just the best coquinas ever. Too take a beer in the afternoon or so I would go to barrio de santa cruz or to one of the places you can see the puente de triana from. 
There are a bunch of things to see if you have the time, the ""casa de pilatos"" is allright, but nothing incredible. Parque maria luisa is nice for a walk and you should definitely go see the ""plaza de españa"". 

Granada is one of the greatest places on earth, every bar will give you food for ordering beer. I don't mean peanuts or chips, I mean a small hamburguer, a pizza slice, a montadito... When you drink your 4th beer you'll tell the waiter not to bring more food please.
The alhambra is simple incredible, you must make reservations to get in it. There is a great sideway view from the ""mirador de san nicolas"" 
Just walk around, turn corners and find amazing little streets. 
Hope im helpfull.

&gt;Economically the case for stimulus at the risk of stoking inflation has still to be won. Politically, it's becoming a no-brainer.

First, I am fully aware that r/Europe is divided on the question whether austerity, stimulus, or a combination of the two, is the right way to deal with the crisis, and also divided on who should cover which portion of the costs of the crisis. 

I personally lean more towards austerity, but not dogmatically so (in the sense that I think now would be a good time for the ECB to lower the long-term interest rates, and perhaps for moderately sized stimulus programs for the countries hit hardest by the recession -- while at the same time continuing to pressure the heavily indebted countries to cut down their structural overspending, even against opposition by the local voters, and to increase overall productivity). To put it shortly, I think the relevant question is: how much stimulus is needed to drag Europe out of the recession, but how little stimulus does it have to be to not give a false sense of security to the nations with unsustainable structural deficits. 

However, all that said, I *do* agree that Europe as a whole (and politics especially) need to give a sign now that they take the social and human dimension of the crisis serious. And in that sense, I very much agree with the statement that politically, stimulus (and/or changing the monetary policy) has become a no-brainer.",0,1335353649,null,0,true,0,c4gdg8w,t3_srhqz,t1_c4gdg8w,t3_srhqz,null,1428792473,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

In both cases, they will have to obey to the EU financial places. Even if Hollande said he wanted to fight against financial stuff. In fact, Hollande would have to make either the people that voted for him or the EU financial places disappointed.

As in france, nothing force the President to follow what he said during the campain, we can guess the President will do what the financial stuff want (financial win everytime, see greece spain italy ...)

Sarkozy would, as Hollande, do the same things = liberalize the most stable kind of employ-contract, the CDI.

Liberalizing this is needed to be at the same level in EU, other major countries from the EU did it some years ago, German and some other and this is now asked to France. Sarkozy will do it quite naturally, because of being liberal and stuff.
Hollande would never be able to do it, he's ""socialist"" (left wing). But in fact he will be able to, while trolling all the people who voted for him.
He said he wanted to re-negociate an EU treaty (the bruxelle's one I think). So he will go, talk with some people, win some unsignificant things and he will say ""look what I did here ! some cool stuff ! but to have this I had to give some things to the EU"" and here he will gave the EU the liberalisation of our most stable contract of employment.

So nothing to worry about, France will still be a nice dominion of the EU :D

There are many variables that can affect GDP, for instance the only real reason China has such a high GDP growth is that their government is investing in a lot of construction projects (hence all of the ghost cities), even though their trade balance is about the same as Germany's.

Don't get me wrong I mostly support what Germany are suggesting, they certainly have a better grasp of macroeconomic development than the Greek government. However, Spain can and should be dealt with differently since their problems are not the same as Greece's.

Also, I tend to say German rather than ""European"" since it is quite clearly Germany leading here. That is not a negative thing, but it is clearly not a collective decision. Equally, saying it is a Dutch approach while true overstates the influence of the Dutch in ensuring that is gets carried out.

&gt; demand German support for stimulus, and, at the same time acknowledge that the economies of the periphery need to undergo fundamental changes. 

I agree, but I'd be tempted to argue that Germany (and others) have done that through the massive transfers of cash to the peripheral countries over the last 15 years. How many roads/airports etc in Spain, Greece et al bear the logo ""funded by the EU""? Quite a few if my travels are anything to go by.

This investment was made but the corrosponding restructure of economies was not done, or stalled - France was a significant player in this since they tend to protectionism. 

Now the good times have effectively gone and tough changes are having to be made under harsher conditions - this is inevitably leading to increased social strife and frustration. All those comfortable cushions that were there are being or have been removed. 

Histoy shows that when such upheavals happen people look for a hate figure, to some extent this is Germany for the Greeks - one would hope that it would have been their own political class that led them to this mess but they have deftly externalised the blame.

You're no doubt right and that more reasoned voices will be suggesting restructure of labour markets and implementing some sensible stimulus but they will be going against unions and others who have entrenched interest in the status quo.

1) that is, at least according to my limited understanding of EU treaties, nowhere near the (legally codified) mission of the ECB. Increasing money circulation, and handing the extra money directly to an investment construction would, I think, violate EU treaties. In other words, we would need a renegotiation of some of those treaties. Is that a viable option?

2) While I also favor private sector investments rather than large EU infrastructure projects, this begs the question who decides how the money is used? Especially in countries that have trouble creating an innovative and competitive business climate (take, as an example, the World banks ""ease of doing business"" index, with Spain on rank 44 and Greece on rank 100), how can you make sure the money will actually be spend usefully. It would be a logistic nightmare, to say the least, to get enough expertise to decide which commercial projects are worth money and which are just grabbing for EU funds.

You can only fix one of those issues by cutting spending, to fix the other two, you also have to spend properly.

Our governments have spent the past 20 years ""spending properly"" trying to reduce unemployment and high trade balance deficit. None of this has ever worked. Thinking that spending more on this will solve the issue is naive, we should concentrate our efforts on reducing the deficit before we end up in a Greek scenario.

The way you view things remind me of gambling addicts who are in huge debt, and whose solution is to keep borrowing money and spend it gambling in hopes that they'll eventually win the jackpot and repay all of their debts. Most European countries have been living above their means for the past decades, and now the only reasonable thing to do is to cut on spending.

- un couple de retraité *totalement friqués*. Ils représentent les retraités friqués
- une famille de CSP*++ aisés*, ils représentent les CSP aisés
- un couple de parisiens fortunés (pour le coup, rien à préciser), ils représentent les grosses fortunes
- une veuve avec un *très gros* patrimoine, elle représente les fortunes héritées
- un couple de classe moyenne *au dessus de la moyenne*, qui représentent sans doute le lecteur moyen du Figaro. 

Effectivement, ce sont des foyers types des classes particulières qu'ils représentent (et qui représentent sans doute une partie de leur lectorat). Ne soyons pas de mauvaise foi, ce n'est pas parce que la majorité de la population ne peut s'identifier à un des groupes qu'il ne s'agit pas de 5 foyers types. 

Mais si je devais donner mon point de vue (même si personne ne le demande), je dirais qu'il me parait hypocrite de ne pas mentionner d'autres types de foyers dans cette rubrique. Pourquoi avoir zappé le chômeur? Pourquoi avoir zappé le couple de smicard, ou la mère au foyer avec plusieurs enfants? Était-ce par envie de cacher la pauvreté comme on cache les clochards? Par manque de recherche? Je suis sûr que s'ils avaient mieux cherchés, ils auraient pu trouver un couple type de ""profiteurs du système""  qui auraient étés favorisés par Hollande et remis à leur place par Sarkozy... 

Et le pire dans tous ça, c'est que ça fait une contre-pub très importante (il suffit de voir le nombre de commentaires).
