You are 4 years old. You want to play with other kids on the playground, but the other kids' parents shoo you away because they don't want their kids to play with a gypsy.

You are 8 year old. The classmates make fun of you, call you names and, being the only gypsy in the class, you're regularly addressed as ""the crow"". The teachers find that funny and support them.

You are 12 years old. The teachers are always be unfair to you because you're a gypsy and that means you must be really dumb, regardless of the actual academic results.

You are 16 years old. The restaurant waiters always treat you badly, sometimes they even deny you service because of your dark skin. No one ever acts nice to you because you're a ""stinking gypsy"" and you don't deserve it. Afterall, because of people with your skin Romania has a bad reputation in Europe.

You are 20 years old. Surprisingly for a gypsy, you get to college and you want to get a summer internship job. You get some interviews, but they always turn you down after seeing your skin colour because you'll probably steal from the company.

true,Ikhtionikos,null,null,"For those of you not living in Romania, it is useful to consider the following issues:
Rromas not only have a particular culture, but also a different mentality. Due to this, they often don't respect the laws of the country and the laws of common sense. This results in:
1. Theft:many rromas steal unscrupulously, because they don't have a concept of private property similar to that you are familiar with.
2. Inappropriate use of public domain. For example, the whole grand family including removed relatives too, camp out for two weeks in the hospital's yard, while a member is being treated inside. 
3. Squatting: they raise their hut wherever they feel like, often in unhabitable environments, where salubrization, current water and electricity is not installed. Sometimes they steal the electricity from high-voltage wires. (In this case, the factory isn't very different and much worst from the places where they voluntarily dwell).
4. Aggression: they are quick to start a fight, are easily provoked. It's enough to look at them to start a brawl. If a by-passer minds his business and gives them no attention, they assault him, obstruct their path, verbally  insult them and even physically challenge them, shoving and pushing them around. At this point, any kind of response is pretense for retaliation.
5. Disrupting public peace: beside the fighting habit, they're also very loud. Having a habit of traveling everywhere with a large family the size of a smaller gang, they talk very loudly, argue and shout over to each other from across the road or the other end of the street, vulgar verbiage is not uncommon. 
6. Unwillingness to integrate in society: lots of them don't apply for personal identification, or ID cards which in Romania is a requirement for citizens to live legally. Those rromas that apply for these ID's do it only to be able to collect social aids and children's allowances. Too few rromas send their children to school, and this is not only a matter of material difficulty. Most of the rromas don't legally own any land, don't have a job and don't contribute to society in any way.
7. Lazyness: while it is true, that currently it's difficult for a rroma to get a well-paying job (mind you, currently it's hard for everybody), most of them don't even apply. They are not always *forced* by society to resort to begging, but they willfully take it up, proving to be a better source of income than a job. It pays more that the current minimal wage and it requires many times less effort.

**Note: I am not generalizing!** I am not saying ALL rromas are like this, and there aren't respectable and honest rroma persons. There are in fact a few, and hattip to those. But the bulk of them are as what I've described them. It's an issue approached from the wrong angle. A person is to be treated with respect, as long as that person also shows respect. There is nothing democratic and tolerant about rroma attitude, thus sollutions based on or censored by political correctness and indiscrimination is equal to tying our hands and keep staying defenseless against rroma abuses, of which international media knows very little or nothing.

To get closer to a ""United States of Europe"" (which would be much more resilient to the type of crisis we have) every country should hand over much of its power and independence, much like in our societies where every person hands over his personal security to the police (the police can be thought as an organization having the monopoly of violence).

But then, it's not in the interest of the politicians at the head of each state to build a major supranational organization, because it would mean  less power for them. These very politicians are the ones making all the decisions right now.

true,Err_Eek,TRAN,Romanian living in Ireland,"a few more details (Baia Mare native here):

- google ""Craica Baia Mare"" in Google images. That's where they were relocated *from*. Basically this mayor relocated them from disease infested shanty town to apartments with fucking bathrooms. Not enough? Well, still better than none, nope?

- independent comisions for human rights have been formed to reach a conclusion. So why do we jump to conclusions without knowing the context? At first all the press was shouting that the rroma suffered from chemical poisoning as a result from living there. Only when it was discovered that it was actually tear gas used by some rroma thugs on their own population, it suddenly became a lot less interesting to report.

- the *ghetto* is right in the heart of fucking Baia Mare. Literally just a ten minute stroll from where I was born and raised, quite near the city centre. Not the best area admittedly

- he cleaned up the shanty towns. In Brazil that happened with mp's basically doing raids. In NY police frisk black people constantly. There people cheer for the results. Here a mayor cleaned up some *illegal* settlements and gave the inhabitants social housing, yet he gets slandered throughout the media without any fucking context given. Really, if I hadn't known about the problem from first hand sources, I would've totally freaked out as well.

- as for the last part - bullshit! the Rroma are free to move throughout the city. Don't tell me reporters can't interview them, if even my middle aged middle class mom can talk to whatever gypsy she wants to. 

- the ""wall"" mentioned in the article was a modest structure meant from keeping rroma kids from running on the road, which they often did, endangering their life in the process. What it was NOT doing was surrounding the gypsy settlement or impeding them in any fucking way from leaving the area. 

Again, I'm not saying that Chereches is the most selfless tolerant guy on Earth. He was also quite tactless when dealing with the gypsies, and even more so when dealing with the media. But he's pretty much liberal, even when compared to some Western mayors. Last time I heard, when they were demolishing gypsy settlements in Italy or France they weren't giving the gypsies free housing afterwards. 

Are the people from Baia Mare racists? They're probably more vocal about it, but really, they're not at all more racist that a brit avoiding Irish travellers, or a French avoiding the Algerian and Senegalese (and Romanians), a German avoiding Turks, etc.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; all you've said is ""Issue Eurobonds. And tax banks more.""

If that's how it came across, then I wasn't clear enough. Let me try again:

Banking union: Banks wouldn't the responsibility of national governments anymore, but of the Eurozone as a whole. A headline like ""Spanish banks in trouble"" wouldn't make any sense anymore, at least not in the context of liquidity problems of the Spanish government. Banks wouldn't be backed by national governments, but collectively by the EZ.  
The way I want it, the EZ would create some new entity to handle oversight (this already exists, I just want it to be more direct and more powerful), collect taxes from the banks, coordinate banks bailouts, and issue bonds to pay for it. Those would be a form of Eurobonds -- this isn't a clearly defined term, but generally it means that they'd be issued and backed by the EZ as a whole instead of by an individual national government.

The way it is now, economic problems in one country, liquidity problems for its government and for its financial sector go hand in hand, and make each other worse. Take Spain, for example. The collapse of their housing market along with the job losses in the construction sector have caused enough problems for the government as it is, now they have to bail out their banks on top of it. That their banks got into trouble at the same time obviously is no coincidence. Had those been not Spanish banks, but EZ banks that would happen to do a lot of business in Spain, the situation would be much easier to handle. Maybe even more importantly, it would effectively stop the issue of capital flight by people who don't trust the safety of Spanish banks anymore, so they could keep lending and the Spanish economy wouldn't have to take the additional hit of lack of credit on top of the housing bust hit. Savings would be guaranteed by the EZ, collectively, no matter where the headquarters of the bank would be and whether the government there would go bankrupt. They'd still be recapitalized by the NEZBA (new Eurozone banking authority), with the collectively guaranteed bonds it could issue. I'm a big believer in ""I pay for it, I own it"", so the equivalent of a nationalization would be ownership by that NEZBA entity thing.  
Similarly, since national governments wouldn't be responsible for oversight and guaranteeing banks that have their HQ there, it seems logical that all the taxes those banks would have to pay would go to the NEZBA, and that tax rates would be set centrally. Those taxes would be used to pay back the bonds, then to create a fund to use for future recapitalizations. Pseudo-nationalized banks would be owned by the same fund. A surplus (or a fixed percentage from the start) could be spent at the European Parliament's discretion.  
Whether those taxes would be higher than what they pay today, and whether it would include a transaction tax, is secondary as far as I'm concerned, and a separate discussion.

This would solve the bulk of problems that the Eurozone is facing today. We could stop worrying about Italy the next morning, Spain would be in a much better position, businesses in all the troubled economies would have easier access to capital, and had we had such a system in place from the start, Ireland wouldn't have needed a bailout and still would have very low government debt.",0,1339714661,null,0,false,0,c50pxcv,t3_v1fm4,t1_c50pxcv,t1_c50jox6,null,1429145248,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Basically the nomad style typical to the Roma is a remnant of a tribal mindset. The Roma have a different system of morals, an alternative justice system (the clan leader or bulibasa) and a higher value attributed to communal living as opposed to individuality. On some levels, this is tolerated by the majority, through the acceptance of some cultural elements (music, specific trades), but close physical proximity will invariably trigger tensions precisely due to these fundamentally incompatible values.

true,g4bliss,Auvergne,Auvergne,"A chaque poche de sang donné, il y a double test pour le VIH (WB+Elisa), mais il existe toujours une chance statistique (de tête dans la fourchette des 0.001-0.0001 %) d'avoir un faux négatif et donc un risque de passer à côté du virus, et de transmettre la maladie. Dès lors pour limiter ce risque, une des solutions est d'exclure du don les populations où la maladie est plus fréquente, ce qui permet de limiter mathématiquement la fréquence des donneurs atteints.

La position des instances de contrôle était que compte tenu du fait de la prévalence plus élevée du VIH dans la communauté homosexuelle masculine, les inclure au don du sang représentait un risque. Les derniers chiffres disponibles confirmaient encore ce fait.

Tu veux une explication claire ? C'est un choix politique à la limite de la démagogie. La prise de risque en pratique est minime (interrogatoire médical pré-test sur les comportements à risque + double test), mais d'un pur point de vue statistique, c'est une mauvaise décision.

BTW avant de vous jeter sur le bouton downvote, je suis bi et interdit de don du sang depuis longtemps, et je trouvais ça parfaitement normal. Les gens peuvent être xénophobes, mais les chiffres ne mentent pas.

EDIT : Je tente de m'expliquer le plus clairement possible pour tout le monde, mais il est possible que certaines tournures de phrase ou certains mots soient mal interprétés, alors je vais essayer de clarifer le fond de ma pensée en un TL;DR : Par la faute de beaucoup de monde (politiques, médecins, structures de santé publique,et aussi une partie de la communauté homosexuelle elle-même), la population homosexuelle masculine est PROPORTIONELLEMENT plus touchée par le VIH, et donc mathématiquement est INEVITABLEMENT plus à risque pour le don du sang, il est donc normal qu'elle en soit écartée.

Je suis par ailleurs opposé à toute forme de discrimination à l'égard des LGBT, mais aussi de TOUS les VIH+ qui en prennent plein la gueule pendant que tout le monde regarde ailleurs.

Check TripAdvisor.com for hotel reviews.  Strike that.  Check for B&amp;B and inns (gasthaus), not hotels.

It's not a doctrine, it's how it is. My country has same problems, VERY VERY similar to Greece. We took insane amounts of credit in the last 10 years, spent it on public sector for wages and pensions and we are now in deep shit. We went from 10 billion Euros in debt around 2000 to 40 billion now. Our government used to take loans just to pay pensions. Our public sector hasn't seen one single job loss during recession while private sector lost ten of thousends of jobs (in a small country that's a lot). Number of unemployed went from 250000 to 350000+ and not a single public worker among those ..... and the government was taking even more loans during recession to pay for those jobs.

Our fucking ex prime minister is on trial for a scheme were they siphoned money from government owned companies to his political party's black fund. 

Did everybody vote for those guys? Nope. I didn't. Am I to blame? Yap, just as any other Croat. 

It was known that you need ""connection"" to get a public sector job, it was known they are stealing and yet they won two elections in a row.

So yes, I think I know what happened in Greece without being there, same shit, same ways, as you say southern doctrine. It was fun while it lasted and we have to pay the price.

true,bubblegumgills,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Actually, I'm Romanian. I moved to the UK 6 years ago to study, but I have lived my whole life in Bucharest. I was raised in Militari, which should tell you a lot about my exposure to gypsies. I was brought up across a train track from a Roma settlement that still exists to this day. So yeah, nice judging based on flair bro. 

I am well aware of how Western Europe views Romanians and the kind of statements that I hear are incredibly xenophobic. I am aware of how the UK feels about immigrants and jobs, about relocating to their country and trying to find work. I am aware of the barriers that are put in place to determine who can come and work here legally. This does not change my attitude towards Roma and their treatment in Romania.

The government does fuck all to integrate them. Oh, they award special places for them in school, knowing that by and large they are an impoverished community who can't afford to send the kids to school. That doesn't solve the issue in any manner. Look at [institutional racism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutionalized_racism) and tell me it looks nothing like what's happening in Romania.

This whole discourse on the mythical working Roma that no one has ever met is used in similar ways to how the US uses the shining example of Asian minorities (particularly Korean Americans and Chinese Americans) in order to promote the idea that they *could* do honest work, they just choose not to. If I counter your argument and tell you that most of the Roma children I grew up with now hold stable jobs in middle management, where does that leave us? I don't think any of them have ever stolen anything or been arrested, so your comment on how they're thieves and criminals is invalid. A lot of white people are thieves and criminals, so why shouldn't we also make the same comments about white Romanians? Also, look up [racial profiling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_profiling)

This defeatist attitude of ""hell, they can't be helped, so let's not even try"" is exactly why racism is still alive and well (and not going anywhere any time soon) in Eastern Europe. As a white person in Romania, you are actually [part of the problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_privilege) and your comments don't really help your case. Roma in general [remain widely undocumented](http://www.balkanethnology.org/files/library/E%20&amp;%20V/Gypsies...pdf), [have issues entering the job marked in skilled positions](http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/24/14/2384217.pdf), and let's not forget that sticky issue of [slavery in Romania pre 1856](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma_in_Romania#Before_1856).

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; If Germany want to take on other EZ countries debt through Eurobonds, I think they should be free to do so, even though I personally think it's financial madness.

Note the ""for this specific purpose"", because that's really important. Vanilla all-purpose Eurobonds would be different, because that would mean assuming risk for something I have no control over. I'm in favor of eventually issuing bonds collectively, but a fiscal union needs to come first. Everything else would be like co-signing a loan without even knowing the amount or what it was for. That would indeed be madness.

It's the same with those collectively issued bonds to finance bailouts for a banking union. Shared risk, shared control, shared benefits. This makes all the more sense since in practice, we already share the risk, the shared control doesn't work very well, and the benefits aren't shared at all. Even more, the way it's set up now, the risk is artificially increased through capital flight from countries that can't credibly guarantee their banks anymore.  
If something goes wrong, it will end up with the tax payer, anyway. Whether we have to bail out another country that has to bail out their banks, their banks because it can't, or our own banks in the end. It's better to reduce the ""if something goes wrong"" part, and a banking union would do that by taking the incentive from increasing pressure on banks by moving capital to another country and by lending credibility to guarantees by backing them up collectively.

&gt;  Also, if the EZ countries want to tax their banks, it is of course up to them.

I just think that if we have to share the risk collectively, which in effect we already do, we should tax them collectively. Otherwise it would be nationalizing profits and collectivizing losses. If a country as a disproportionally large financial sector, of course that's great as long as they're doing fine, but then that country is even less likely to be able to bail it out without help if it blows up. Not that banks would typically pay all that much in taxes, anyway.

&gt; Also, a transaction tax is not a smart thing to do, if not a lot more states are in on it than just the EZ countries.

I'm still undecided on the transaction tax issue, I've just mentioned it because it's a demand from the German opposition to help pass the Fiscal Compact, and I usually feel better represented by them than by Merkel's government coalition. When I said the banks should be taxed jointly, I didn't mean there necessarily should be any additional taxes, but that the taxes banks already pay (to the extend they pay them) should be set and collected collectively, since we already effectively share the risk.",0,1339754583,null,0,false,0,c50x45a,t3_v1fm4,t1_c50x45a,t1_c50w64m,null,1429148768,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,___alt,ZZZZZZcoq,Coq,"&gt; L'intérêt de cette mise en demeure n'est pas d'intenter une action en justice : l'UFC demande à Blizzard de régler les problèmes sous une quinzaine de jours, sans quoi elle se réserve le droit d'effectuer une action en justice. Si Blizzard règle ces problèmes dans les temps je ne vois pas pourquoi l'UFC irait au procès. Ce n'est donc pas une question ""d'arriver après la bataille"", mais d'ordonner la résolution de problèmes qui impactent pas mal d'utilisateurs au vu des retours de l'appel à témoignage lancé par l'association.

Mais ce qui est comique, c'est que la majorité des problèmes sont déjà réglés au moment où l'UFC met Blizzard en demeure. Que l'UFC prenne la défense des gens qui ont acheté Diablo 3 et ne peuvent pas y jouer est quelque chose de normal pour une association de consommateurs, seulement voilà, au moment où ils crient au loup... il n'y a plus de loup. C'est ce problème de timing que je souligne, pas le processus en lui-même.

&gt; Pour ce qui est du dédommagement, je ne vois pas en quoi un juge ne pourrait pas statuer sur un montant qui représenterait les dommages occasionnés pour les joueurs. Mais de toutes façons, à en lire le communiqué de presse de l'UFC, ça a plutôt l'air d'être une demande de geste commercial pour les utilisateurs que d'un ordre donné sous peine de procès.

J'imagine d'ici un juge qui doit évaluer le dommage subi par un individu qui a subi des indisponibilités d'un service en ligne de loisirs qu'il a payé au plus 60€ et donc il peut jouir depuis cette période à peu près sans restriction. Comme tu dis, on pourrait imaginer un geste commercial, mais de quel ordre ? Au final, ce que les gens voulaient, c'est jouer.

Il semblait d'ailleurs absolument évident pour quiconque doté de deux sous de jugeote que la situation allait rapidement s'améliorer et qu'il convenait de laisser un peu la pression de la sortie et des premiers patchs retomber. Que sont deux semaines de perturbations par rapport à la durée de vie totale de ce genre de jeux vidéos ? J'ai vu des gens dire ""ce jeu est défectueux, je ne peux pas me connecter !"" : mais à part le désagrément relativement mineur (pour quelqu'un de patient), quelle différence entre pouvoir réellement jouer le 15 et réellement jouer 15 jours plus tard ?

&gt; Personnellement je trouve pas mal ironique ce qui arrive à Blizzard : à avoir voulu imposer son DRM obligeant d'avoir une connexion permanente, l'éditeur se retrouve contraint à garantir le bon fonctionnement de ses serveurs sans quoi les utilisateurs peuvent lui demander des comptes.

Le bon fonctionnement des serveurs n'a pas à être garanti. Blizzard doit de bonne foi faire son possible pour que les serveurs fonctionnent sans problème, mais n'a pas de niveau de service à garantir.

If you are a German, you know that your banks, even if they have done stupid deals are less at risk, if nothing else because the Germans state have the finances (even if it would hurt), to save them.

Oh, I know they're much less at risk. I just prefer to bail out a Spanish bank now than a German bank afterwards. Not because I'm such a nice guy, but because it's probably cheaper overall -- if that Spanish bank goes, a Portugese one might be next, and so on. If all of those countries could reliably keep their banks afloat, no problem, but some of them can't, even without the added stress of people moving their savings elsewhere and their economies taking the hit from the crisis. ""Less at risk"" doesn't mean that there's no risk. Might as well spare people there to go through all this, and if they don't worry about their savings, odds are much better that their banks will be fine.

&gt;  And, frankly, the government of the Netherlands (for example for) priority should be the welfare of the people in the Netherlands . 

The welfare of the people in the Netherlands is best served if we can avoid the financial system of one country after another collapsing, and that this would serve the welfare of the people there is another plus.

&gt; You are writing that it's a given that banks shouldn't be allowed to fail in each country.

Yes. If banks fail, businesses fail, then economies fail. Who will be buying our machines and luxury cars then? This crisis is very expensive for us, bailouts or not.

&gt; If I were a bank I'd move the operations that I could move, to a country that taxed less.

I'm just saying that the banks should pay their taxes to the Eurozone *instead* of to their national governments.

&gt; Sweden can only benefit from it.

It would indeed be great for Sweden if we could avoid bank failures and crashing economies from cascading throughout the Eurozone. 

Maybe it's time to finally make those reusable tables I've wanted so often for discussions here. Below are the claims that banks of Eurozone countries have towards the GIIPS, in millions of dollars. The source is table 9B [here](http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qa1006.pdf) and [here](http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qa1206.pdf) (PDF).  
I'm too lazy to convert it to percentage of GDP, but I can already hear people screaming that it was all just a bailout of French and German banks through the backdoor, so keep that in mind. The Austrian, Belgian, and Dutch banks were roughly as exposed to Greece as the German ones, relative to the size of their economies (which is what the bailout contributions are based on), not to mention the Irish and Portuguese.

true,g4bliss,Auvergne,Auvergne,"&gt;Ce genre de raisonnement conduit aux délits de faciès et beaucoup d'autres amalgames néfastes. Le terme ""risque"" n'est qu'un cache-sexe.

Le terme de risque n'est pas là pour cacher mon mépris (ou n'importe quel autre sentiment péjoratif que vous subodorez) à l'égard des homosexuels, il exprime une réalité (désolante certes, mais bien vraie malgré tout) : L'institut de veille sanitaire (INVS) a modélisé le risque que constituerait l'ouverture du don de sang aux hommes ayant un seul partenaire sexuel masculin dans les 12 derniers mois. Le risque résiduel de contamination par le VIH pourrait être multiplié par 4. En 2010, le nombre de cas de découverte de séropositivité VIH était de 6 pour 100 000 pour les hétérosexuels. Et de 758 pour 100 000 chez les homosexuels masculins (Données INVS). Le risque d'exposition au VIH est 200 fois plus élevé lors d'une relation sexuelle entre hommes que lors d'une relation hétérosexuelle ou d'une relation sexuelle entre femmes.

&gt;On devrait établir une bonne fois pour toute que l'on ne devrait pas juger les gens sur la base de leur orientation sexuelle, de leur ethnie, religion ou autre critère généralisant. Désolé mais personnellement, je ne trouve pas ça normal. 

Vous vous trompez sur un point précis: je ne juge personne ! Je ne parle pas de morale, mais de médecine (pire, d'épidémiologie). Est-il raciste de dire qu'être d'ethnie noire augmente votre risque de diabète ? Non. De même, il n'est pas homophobe de dire que la population homosexuelle a une prévalence supérieure d'infection au VIH.

&gt;Si on a un test médical que l'on juge suffisamment fiable, alors il doit être considéré comme fiable POUR TOUS (homos, bi, hétéros, trans, black, blancs, tout le monde). Sinon ça veut dire quoi ? que le test devient subitement moins fiable lorsqu'il est appliqué à un homosexuel ?

Je vous renvoie à mon explication première : le test est bon, mais il n'est pas PARFAIT ! En partant de ce constat, on sait qu'il existe toujours un risque qu'un VIH+ passe au travers des mailles du filet. A partir de là, pour minimiser le risque que ça arrive, on pioche dans les populations les moins atteintes par la maladie, c'est tout simplement logique.
(Et au passage, petit bonus : le test est en effet moins bon sur les homos ! C'est toujours des maths et toujours pas de la xénophobie : une prévalence plus élevée augmente mathématiquement les probabilités de faux négatifs, bienvenue dans l'horrible monde des statistiques)
&gt;Comme vous le dîtes ce n'est qu'une question de démagogie.

Local and regional government would remain the same, it's not like your town mayor would suddenly be a foreigner, much less a corrupt one that is immune to Swedish law. ;)",0,1339768827,null,0,false,0,c50yvna,t3_v22dr,t1_c50yvna,t1_c50yh0z,null,1429149666,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Well, why haven't you build up a system like that then? If one care about paying taxes for example, why are people evading.

Because they can get away with it. Because the justice system is slow and inefficient.

&gt;No, my money who now goes to Stockholm to politician whom I know to be some of the least corrupt in the world, would go to Brussel, where they would be taken care of by politician who, let's just say, are not know for being the least corrupted in the world. 

The politicians would be the same, the ones that are now in Stockholm making decisions for all of Sweden would still do that. They'd just be together with other European politicians to govern together over the European aspects.

You can't have politicians from all over Europe governing Sweden and you can't have only Swedes ruling over Europe, I think this is just fair.

&gt;I could for example be responsible for paying for the Greeks, to a much broader extent than I am now. That, while the Greeks are on number 80 on the Transparency International list (beaten by half of Africa for example) and where tax evasion is rampant. 

Greece is a special case which requires a much closer look. Nevertheless, Greece would have to be the one reaching the best levels of transparency, not everyone else downgrading to their level. And when it comes to these issues, a single set of laws and requirements would go a long way. That way, when you payed the Greeks, you'd know that they would have to follow the same strict regulation that you do and not a more loose one. Again, it's only fair, if you're paying them, you should have the same guarantees that you would have if you were paying another Swede.

&gt;It would be sheer madness to hand over power to countries who don't think they need to follow rules and regulation and don't place the same importance on these things as the Swedes do

Which is why stronger laws and a stronger union would benefit us all. If your strict laws and regulation were the same all over the EU, everyone else would stop performing sub-optimally, it's a change of pace that can't be made in a day but in the long run would be best for all of us.

Oh, no, they would call themselves National Socialists. Common nationalists at the time tended to be Monarchists. The Nazis were really big on gestures, traditions and ideology, albeit always ready to abandon aspects of it when they became inconvenient. This seems like a contradiction, but you can't expect populists to be consistent. 

&gt; So.. for me it's pretty simple... UKIP supporters should be shamed before we get to the point of having anything stupid happen -- based on history.

The UKIP is really quite different from the NSDAP, and I don't think they'd have a chance to get a majority even if the UK had an electoral system that wouldn't have the built-in tendency for a two-party system to emerge, but of course this doesn't mean their supporters shouldn't be shamed.

I'm 61.  Have been going to Germany every year or two since 1991.  Exactly like you guys, business then smell some roses.

You guys need to get a car and and go to Goslar.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goslar

Never been destroyed by war.  Historical wealth from mining up the the Harz mountains.  Read hotel reviews at www.Booking.Com and pick one in the old town.  Looking at the photos, I think I stayed at Altstadt-Hotel Gosequell (8 years ago?)

Dine at Brauhaus Goslar.  Drink ""Gosebier"".  Gose is the river that runs through the city.  Gosebier is a wheatbeer filtered through fir (or fir btanches?) ""tannenbaum"".

Visit the Kaiserpfalz.  Bonus points for finding the painting where the horses' gaze seems to follow you (optical illusion)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Palace_of_Goslar

Visit the town museum.  One interior door has an old painting a depicting a Jew being downed in a well during the Plague.  Entering from the East Gate, turn left and follow the wall. Keep an eye out for the old Jewish cemetery.

Visit the mine!!
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mines_of_Rammelsberg

Very close to Goslar is Quedlinburg (another World Heritage site)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quedlinburg
While in Quedlinburg, learn what a ""Roland"" is.  I have friends in Calbe, which is also a ""Rolandstadt"" (otherwise not an interesting place).

Spend your last night in Braunlage up in the mountains.  Then head back to Essen.

Good place to read about traffic signs ESPECIALLY the right of way signs:

That wouldn't be the goal of it, the goal would be European unity. Better standards for everyone would be just one benefit, there are much more.

&gt;Well, have have a law against that - voted for in our parlament. I don't see any reason why the Portugese or any other country can't choose to vote for a law like that, and then implement it. I think it would be better if you did, withouth the EU on you back, that would to me, indicate a real change, and it wouldn't be enforced from Brussels. 

Yeah, well, the political will needs to exist and it would come about easier if everyone made the same compromises. We're already planning on adding the fiscal golden rule to our constitution but surely the whole thing would be more tranquilizing to foreign investors in Europe if everyone did the same, right?

(btw, It's Portuguese, not Portugese.)

&gt;Well, it is being forced now, and democracy is taking a beating. If a federation is built upon that, it doesn't deserve to be built. So, it should stop.

While I'm sure there will be some attempts to further European integration, I can't say democracy is taking a beating or that it will be imposed on everyone. Don't go around saying the end is nigh, it clearly isn't.

&gt;All this is being done, to save the Euro in it's current form. If the EZ countries want to do that, of course they can, but I don't think the Euro in it's current form is worth saving.

If the Euro is lost then all of Europe will lose a lot monetary-wise and future attempts will also be much more difficult to implement, and it would also hamper the free-market.

&gt;But what I really dislike i the forced quick integration of the EU to save the Euro. If one has to sacrifice democracy to save the Euro, I really don't think it's worth saving.

I never said every Greek agreed to this, but ..... there were elections, somebody won, somebody lost, government was made. That government became legal representative of all Greeks, those who voted for them and those who voted against them.

Greek government, elected on free elections signed those deal in the name of all Greek citizens. They took the money in their name, what they did with it, why they did it, how they did it .... is up to the Greeks to discuss.

But ..... this kid and his parents are part of the Greek people whose legal and freely elected representatives made this shit happen. And on that level they share the guilt. Personally? Probably not ... he didn't vote, his parents voted for someone else, but as a part of whole Greek nation that freely elected these scumbags into power .... they are guilty and they will have to deal with consequences.

There is nothing personal in my posts. It's just that many Greeks are pointing in all possible directions but the right one.

Tax evasion? Did it happen last year? It was all ok before? Nope ... that's systemic problem of the Greek nation and because there is deep economic crisis it reared its ugly head and is fucking them as hard as possible.

Corruption? Same shit. It didn't come with cheap loans when they joined Euro.

Oversized public sector? Again, same shit.

These are all problems Greece had **before** joining eurozone. These are systemic problems in their society. This recession only made them visible and is causing a lot of damage. On this level .... Greeks are guilty. As a nation.

Sparrows chirp and fly by on everytable to pick on the crumbs of the cakes, that are also motherfucking delicious (protip : don't buy one, you'd buy two, then three at least). You can also smoke a shisha there (best with friends). Just next to it is the Rue Mouffetard (one of the most famous streets of Paris) with a market on some days (can't remember which though) and one of the longest motherfucking collections of motherfuckingly packed bars in all of Paris at night. Just next to the mosque is also a beautiful public garden and a Natural History Museum, which, as it is public, is free for any EU resident within 18-26.

2. If you read Err_eek's comment below for more details, you'll understand that they are not rounded up. They already converge and separate themselves and live in an area where nobody else lives. In this case, that area happened to be close to the city center, where unauthorised dwellings were naturally illegal. Often the local authorities build or give them a building where they can live for free, without paying anything except utilities. The government does not do this for the rest of the population. Young people have difficulty finding cheap flats to start off a family responsably. This mayor gave them a disused factory building, which is in much better shape and a much more suited living ambient than their previous sqatting hovels. Also, this is a temporary sollution, until city aedils can come up with a better sollution.
3. What you called cultural ""problems"" are major differences, not according to my views, but with the social and political structure of the country. They are nomads in a settled country and often place themselves outside the state's laws.

Who said that simple handouts are okay? How about we do a joint unemployment fund or poverty fund in Europe? That's all I care about: not seeing people die in the streets because they cannot afford food or medicine. The rest, we can figure it out. 

&gt; people ""living off the trash"" etc. may be the unfortunate result of people not having lived within their means before

As I said above, that simply isn't true. They are unemployed. The economy got worse and they are left without money because they can't find a job. Their personal money management skills play no role in this. Some of them may have been overspending before, some of them may have been saving as much as they could.  

&gt; Maybe when people are forced to save up and consider their spending they will finally demand the same from their politicians,

Maybe there's a systemic problem that has to do with Romas, but the leap between that and generalizing the whole lot of them is pretty wide.

&gt; To be clear: we don't dislike them because they have darker skin, different language and culture. It's because they are aggressive, uncooperative and unwilling to respect the society's and the state's laws.

I am not suggesting that, and it's good that that's at least the case. But, as other Romanians have said here, the only way to know whether someone's Roma or not is the color of their skin. And when you begin to associate the color of someone's skin with heightened aggression and a disregard for the law, doesn't that start getting uncomfortably close to racism to you?

It's not just about Romas, you know. It's about you. Once you start assuming that dark people have a higher chance of being criminals, it doesn't take much for the human brain to take the next step and assume white people are somehow more civilized than dark people by their very nature.

Not really.

They have a history of recommending who to vote for, though. From wikipedia:

&gt;Bei der Europawahl in Deutschland 2009 gab die FTD eine Wahlempfehlung für Bündnis 90/Die Grünen heraus. Vor der Bundestagswahl im gleichen Jahr empfahl sie die Union, als Wunschkoalition wurde eine Tendenz zu Schwarz-Grün deutlich.

and earlier: 

&gt;Die FTD sorgte im September 2002 für Aufsehen und Kritik, als sie – wie in der angelsächsischen Presse üblich – vor der Bundestagswahl 2002 eine Wahlempfehlung aussprach: Sie empfahl, die CDU zu wählen. Auch im September 2005 sprach sie eine Wahlempfehlung aus, diesmal zugunsten der FDP.

Their recommendations didn't always win. And it's quite unusual in Germany for a newspaper to make such recommendations.

true,StoneCall,SACH,Leipzig,"&gt; My question is, as a dual citizen, what kind of tuition would I pay in Germany?

In which state do you plan to study? Most states do not charge tuition (with some exceptions which probably don't apply to you), only a Semesterbeitrag (which generally pays for reduced-rate meals and free public transport). In a state without tuition, expect to pay between 50 and 300 euros per semester; tuition is generally around 500 euros per semester (on top of the Semesterbeitrag).

Also, keep in mind there is no ""graduate school"" in Germany. There is (generally) a three-year bachelor, followed by a two-year master, followed by an infinite-year doctorate. Check with the university of your choice if and where they'll admit you and what requirements will be waived.",0,1339806990,null,0,false,0,c517op8,t3_v45ty,t1_c517op8,t3_v45ty,null,1429153891,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2
true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"It seems like a good opinion piece that explains the various things at play from the perspective of Greece.

The tricky thing comes in when people actually start believing that SYRIZA will ""bargain"". I suspect that what will more than likely happen in the event of SYRIZA winning is the following:

- Greece plays hardball and says ""Ha! We want a better deal""
- EU/IMF/ECB: We already told you there is no way that it can be modified.. we made this clear a long time ago before you even agreed to take the money. Do you guys still not understand that your finances were/are in a situation only seen by very few poor nations and shit has never ended up well in any of those cases?

So what happens there? Either SYRIZA says ""okay :( it was worth a try"".. but no -- they built it up as being their entire platform for being voted, so at this point they have no option but to follow through with their threats, which will effectively have them leave the eurozone by themselves or being kicked out for being a country that goes against its commitments therefore cannot be trusted to remain or some weird crap like that -- I'm pretty sure they can find some legal loophole to make it happen.

On the other hand: we already know that a lot of people are openly talking about fiscal union/political union (even David Cameron and Obama are talking about it ffs). Seems to make more sense to stand by the commitments made to the EU/EZ -- as they're publicly talking about creating mechanisms to pay off Greece's excessive debts.

So what a greek should ask themselves based on this information -- is it worth trying to ""stick it to them"" just to find out that they just threatened their way out of their commitments and may end up finding themselves outside of the EU/EZ on the footsteps of the fiscal union/political union openly being mentioned by some of the world's most powerful politicians?

And no, the eurozone will probably not fall apart if a Grexit happened.. it would just make it much more urgent to get that fiscal union stuff passed. So if we think about that for a moment.. we can definitely see that Greece can find themselves being made an example of. I'm quite sure watching Greece going through what Argentina went through will scare everyone else enough to avoid trying to be a hero after that.

We can all pretty much agree that no matter what happens (unless the fiscal/political union thing kicks in soon), Greece is gonna suffer -- but we know almost certainly that they will suffer more within the next 5 years outside of the eurozone than in it. Does anybody HONESTLY think they have something to bargain for or that the others will cut them a better deal after making it absolutely clear that no such thing will happen ?

P.S. Spain got a better deal because their debt is still at ""reasonable"" levels -- Greece's debt was more like ""WTF"".",0,1339807167,null,0,1339807631,0,c517ptw,t3_v49hr,t1_c517ptw,t3_v49hr,null,1429153903,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Yes, there are six neo-Nazis in the Saxony state parliament, all of them wore their ""uniform"" brand. They don't normally wear T-shirts, much less printed ones, but try to uphold an appearance of being respectable. Of course this was intentional.

There should be better ways of dealing with this that doesn't give them the images they want.

For example, the Americans have been inside European heads for a while now. We're in your TV, in you're radio, making you believe all sorts of shit. Why not use similar tactics against the gypsies?

There is that one movie about the South Africa rugby team, being white as it is, and how their victories helped South Africa integrate. Do you see where I'm going with this?

As far as I'm concerned, you can get the gypsies set up in a park, through up a giant white screen, and blamo. Next thing you'll know, you'll have a gypsie Prime Minister. Afterwards, you can have a movie about a latin choir. The main character is a priest, played by whomever is famous in Poland. He is good at singing. He creates some catholic group, and is walking by a gypsie camp. He finds a family, a boy and a girl, brings them into the choir, and they win the Eurovision contest (or some shit, idk). **Make a movie about how some Catholic takes a bunch of misfits of different races and combines them into a musical sensation**. Suddenly, gypsies will feel all appreciated and shit. They'll *try* to do these magical things they see on the screen, and then, once they do it, they'll find stable homes and jobs are way better then being annoying on the street.

true,Ikhtionikos,null,null,"There might be some statistics, didn't manage to find them on a quick notice, and to be honest, I wouldn't believe them either. Like many other things in Romania, they can easily be forged to show a certain reality. The census taking place last year only has preliminary results and states that only 619000 people are of roma ethnicity, which means roughly 3% of the population. In reality, there are at least twice as many, but during the census they declared themselves romanian or hungarian. What is written down about you depends solely on what you declare. The person fillin out the form can't overwrite the information, if he notices that you say you're arabian, but look nothing like them and can't speak arabic. Another issue is that I'm not sure statisticians really dare go into areas where some of the romas live.
Now, about identifiying the roma person. Other romanians were hasty to say that their skincolor is the only way of knowing them. Many non-roma have as dark a skin as the romas, like some of my friends and relatives. Some romas have whiter skin that the general population. There are other signs though, like characteristic features, resembling the hindi more than the caucasian-and I only mean this regarding the shape of the face etc, not skin color. Another dead giveaway is the purple-brownish tint of the lips, as opposed to the pink-read lips of caucasians. So, I am not (and hopefully other romanians either) associating dark skin with criminals, I'm associating a certain, unfortunately very common type of rroma, that you know when you see with aggressiveness and untrustworthiness.

Seeing as culture is difficult to measure, let's look at a few likely relevant facts, note that some of these facts hold true for other places of the world as well (and this list is by no means exhaustive or complete, it is merely an example), but in my view it is the combination of all that makes the EU so diverse:

In the EU we have 27 member states and over 500 million people. The populations of these countries ranges from 500,000 to 80 million.

Including non-EU eastern European states, the EU continent contains 283 areas recognised as World Heritage Sites by Unesco - an enormous amount.

6 out of the 10 most visited art museums in the world are in the EU, and 50 out of the top 100 most visited.

We have Catholic countries, Protestant countries, Orthodox countries, and Secular countries. We have significant historical and cultural relations with and populations of Muslims, Jews, and more.

We have experienced growth, decline, war, co-operation, destruction, construction, enlightenment, persecution, and more. We have hated each other. We have loved each other.

We can trace our cultural roots to Greeks, Romans, Moors, Vandals and Goths, Celts, and more.

We have experienced mass upheavel that has permanently changed countries and societies. We have monarchies, republics, democracies.

We have countries that have a literary history so elaborate that you could spend numerous lifetimes studying it.

We have countries with an artistic heritage so varied that you could never see the end of it.

Although difficult to measure, it's believed there are around 200 languages spoken in Europe, with varying proficiency and prevalence. That is not counting the languages brought by immigrants and migrants.

There are national and regional cuisines ranging from the subdued to the eclectic.

We have some peoples that you could try to define with one phrase, and others that defy much explanation.

I'm sure that the United States is developing diverse cultures amongst it states. Nevertheless, what strikes me as the fundamental difference is that to identify the cultural diversity in the US, you have to actively look and point to the differences, as the majority of things are shared.

In my view, it is the opposite in the EU. Each people and each region in this continent has a unique story. We are so incredibly diverse and varied that we barely understand each other, yet we choose to focus on those things we share. We accept that we're all different, and that sometimes this has led to conflict, and still we realise that despite all of our differences (and there are a LOT), we still share some things, and that those things are to be appreciated.

Linking back to the start of the post, I mentioned it is difficult to measure culture, and therefore take what I've just written with a grain of salt. Your definition of culture may differ from mine.

 It may not be the factors themselves that generate the incredible cultural diversity, it is their combination. This is precisely why it irks me that some view 'Europe' as some largely homogenous entity with little quirks here and there to seperate them, because it is so far from the truth. 

If you come here, and if your final thoughts where that, essentially, there's about as much difference amongst regions and countries here as between US states, then you are ignoring not only hundrends and thousands of years of unique histories, but the very real identities of those places you've been.

I find 'In Varietate Concordia' to be a perfect fit.

Edit: I've cleaned it up a bit and made it more coherent, it was early when I wrote it.

--- I in no way mean to imply that other regions of the world are void of culture. All cultures have (at least some) values and qualities to be cherished. It is still my sincere belief that the incredible variation and diversity we have on this continent, and combined with the appreciation we show it through attitudes and initiatives, has created something unique.

hehe, cherry picking much? Just check the comments of the original poster and anarchisto in this very thread (both easterners). I do fancy mine own as constructive and positive arguments, but I do realize that I may be too aggressive here and there.

As for the things you hear in ""your media"", well, not that I want to sound like I'm media bashing, but you're never going to hear things in the media that aren't eye catching. If I hadn't lived there for a short while, I could've sworn France is one of the most racially and culturally discriminative countries on the planet from what the media says**.

&gt; By *any* human rights ranking Eastern Europe scores worse than Western countries.

I consider the right of a woman to terminate a pregnancy a valuable human right. So just for the sake of it, check the leniency of abortion laws in any Eastern European democracy vs say... Portugal, Spain and even better, Ireland. And also, your mild* Geert Wilders scored more than our extremist parties in the latest elections (Great Romania Party and New Generation Party, they never score more than 7% combined). **But yes**, we still do have to work on our gay rights and affirmative action towards the rroma. And speaking of rroma, I'd really like to see which country has more affirmative action programs towards them than Romania.

&gt; you can't take criticism because it's too confronting and you prefer to find fault with others instead of yourself.

that's not an Eastern European thing. In my experience no culture likes to be criticized as one culture. And trust me, we do find faults within ourselves. If you ever had ever spent a couple of days in any country in Eastern Europe (or even watched a friggin' post communist movie) you might have noticed that we're quite a self deprecating folk. Ok, maybe not the Greeks.

I would actually say that this sort of cross-border political comment and opinion is not only to be expected, but actually necessary for any sort of union to function. Greeks must read German newspapers, and Germans Greek newspapers, if they are to be able to understand each other, and make joint decisions at a European level. If Greeks don't like what Germans are saying, fine, all political unions have disagreements, but don't attack their right to comment.

I think another issue with comparing the cultural diversity of US states with European countries is the fact that those European countries themselves also have regional differences between their constituent counties/states/provinces/cantons, etc. In Spain for example, the Basque country, Galicia and Catalonia are all culturally distinct from the main interior region of Spain and all have their own language. The Basque language isn't a Romance language like Spanish, it isn't even an Indo-European language which means it's at least 5000 years old. It's possible that given hundreds or thousands of years of separate evolution, the US states could become as culturally distinct from each other as the European countries, however this is unlikely as in this modern age the states could not achieve the level of isolation from one another that enabled the European countries to develop such distinct cultures.

I think you've touched upon an interesting point - one of the reasons the cultures are so diverse is a combination of sufficient isolation to develop a unique character, with plenty of exposure (in an increasing amount of time) to other cultures in order to promote change and growth.

true,captainhamster,EURO,Special Snowflake,"This question has interested me, and I've decided to reply to myself because the above argument gives one side of the story.

First, I'd like to identify the main issues with the question:

Culture is difficult to establish, I've already mentioned this, but perhaps many Europeans and Americans have a different idea of culture? We've all seen the discussion where the American arrogantly proclaims that the whole world has adopted American culture, whilst the European, in an equally arrogant tone, claims that the US has no culture.

Perhaps this is because our ideas of culture, and our priorities for culture, are different? The following consists of gross generalisations, but Europeans innately link culture to history. We view our history, our development, as the epitome of culture. We quickly disregard any nation without a long history because they couldn't possibly have culture. Let's call this an exclusive view of culture - we're older, so we have it, you're younger, so we decide that you don't have it.

For Americans, it seems to be more about impact, about spread. The fact that American products are exported and used around the world would connote 'culture' and that the American 'way' is emulated world wide. This attitude seems to think that a Mcdonalds in London means that the UK is 'Americanised'. This is a consumer based view on culture - the fact that aspects of American products (in some senses culture) are being used, means they are being 'Americanised'.

I'm not presenting this as fact, merely my views on the experiences with culture. This does stray somewhat from the question asked, because we're not asked does the US have culture, we're asked if the US is as diverse as the EU is, and vica versa.

I still stand by my point that the EU is much more culturally diverse, but seeing as my previous post focused heavily on the EU, perhaps I ought to focus on the US, an area where I am much, much less knowledgeable. 

From my point of view, which is of course heavily influenced by the European view, the US culture is inherently imported. It has come through immigration. Over time these people have meshed into a more homogenised grouping. There's still an argument to be made for all the different groups like American-Indian, American-Mexican etc., but in my view that's not quite culture. Because what it is much more people clinging to the culture of *another* place, than it is making their own. At best it is a mixture of US culture with another places. This doesn't produce true cultural diversity, because there's a broad general American culture, which has flavours of this and that in various places. It is and remains American culture. A much fairer comparison would be the US to another state-based country, like Germany. But even then I would argue that Germany is more culturally diverse (compare Bayern to Frisian speaking parts of the North, for instance).

I find it hard to put it into words, as it's more of a feeling, but I suppose that in sum, exposure to and availability of parts of a different culture does not equal cultural diversity, it is more a product of globalisation. Having an indian restaurant down the street does not necessarily make your neighbourhood culturally diverse. I can't quite think of a more accurate or fair way to put it, but I'll try to think of one.

Once again, this is not to claim the US doesn't have culture (it definitely does), or that it is not culturally diverse (it absolutely is), it's more that in the US, there's a top down construction of culture - there's the overarching American culture within which there are various shades that are influenced by external cultures. In the EU, it's a bottom-up approach, where there are numerous indigenous cultures, that together attempt to construct an overarching entity.",0,1339846561,null,0,false,0,c51d0ey,t3_v4ljv,t1_c51d0ey,t1_c51bshg,null,1429156387,33,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,33

true,IdeaPowered,null,null,"To say that the US has no culture is ignorant and asinine. (I know you didn't and don't say so but some people do say that.)

In 226 years that country has birthed various musical genres, almost innumerable authors and artists, and has had a great number of scientific and political upheavals. It has been a driving force in ""capitalism"" and ""democracy"" in the world and all the attitudes that has.

Saying that the EU is more culturally diverse might be true to an extent but saying that the US is ""homoegenous"" is also quite wrong. Louisiana is not like New York. California is not like Texas. There are sub-cultures in the USA that do not readily appear on TV. From the ignorant flag waving hick to the hipster conscientious objector who only eats free range chickens. Chicago is not like New York. Houston is not like Orlando. 

The problem could be that people think: United States = TV Americans and that somehow language diversity is a barrier to culture. Since most of the US speaks English then it's homogenous, right? Wrong.

Go to something as basic as ""common"" sayings. Ask someone from Jersey, now someone from D.C. There will be the ""universal"" ones (which are very commonly found in European countries as well just in a different language) but you will still have the local ones.

&gt;From my point of view, which is of course heavily influenced by the European view, the US culture is inherently imported. It has come through immigration.

That is exactly what Europe is but a longer time ago. How many emperors went around trying to get it all and spreading their culture to every single part of Europe? You can travel around Europe and identify architecture through history in many countries. Look at the root of the languages! Are they homogeneous since many were all born from the same roots?

&gt;This doesn't produce true cultural diversity, because there's a broad general American culture, which has flavours of this and that in various places. It is and remains American culture. 

Once again this is stereotypical and quite wrong. I can say the same thing about Europe. There is a thing called ""being European"" and it fits a lot, if not the majority, of them. Right?

To quote you:

&gt;""It may not be the factors themselves that generate the incredible cultural diversity, it is their combination. This is precisely why it irks me that some view 'Europe' as some largely homogenous entity with little quirks here and there to seperate them, because it is so far from the truth.""

Change ""Europe"" to ""United States"" and you have done the same thing. In the same unfair manner too.

""Americanised"" is not by defined by using products but by attitudes and adopting words and ideas. McDonalds is considered Americanised not because its McDonalds but because of what it stands for (example): Cheap fast food chain store on every corner.

&gt;Once again, this is not to claim the US doesn't have culture (it definitely does), or that it is not culturally diverse (it absolutely is), it's more that in the US, there's a top down construction of culture - there's the overarching American culture within which there are various shades that are influenced by external cultures. In the EU, it's a bottom-up approach, where there are numerous indigenous cultures, that together attempt to construct an overarching entity.

This is all extremely relative to when you start to think and count it. The US is 226 years old (I think). Go back to when Europe was that and see if it isn't similar.

NOTE: This is from someone NOT from the US. I just find this topic interesting.

PS

Things like this are a very skewed way of looking at the issue:

""6 out of the 10 most visited art museums in the world are in the EU, and 50 out of the top 100 most visited.""

Here:

""5 out of the 10 most visited Texan hamburger joints are in Texas."" No surprise there, is there?

Museum Art is nothing more than history (in this context). In essence that says ""We've been around for longer and have more stuff to show you. Also, since we were the ones to sort of... invent it, well, we have the best of that period."" Everyone wants to see the old and the well known. That is beyond obvious. This isn't an objective way to look at it since it parts from an uneven ground. 

What has Europe done in the last 100 years that merits a most visited museum? (Honest question)

It is unfair to generalize either one, especially if it starts the point of view of someone who has little to no experience with one side or the other. It's comparing ""what I have seen"" to ""what I have known"".

Comparing the ""culture"" of a teenager to one of an ""old war hound"" is not fair nor comparable. 

I spent quite a number of years moving inside the US and found there to be quite a difference between places. I have also lived in Europe now for a good number of years and find that it is similar. Going from Madrid to Berlin to Amsterdam I can be unfair and call them all ""Big European Cities"" in the same manner going from Los Angeles to Chicago to New York makes them all just ""Big American Cities"".

&gt;we're asked if the US is as diverse as the EU is

If the US has imported cultures from the whole world... then yes? As a country within it's borders it holds about as many people as all of Europe (a few millions here or there..) and a very high chance of a sample of each. Is it ""national culture"" then?

*Edit* The grammar is do.

*Edit 2* 21 of the top 100 museums in the world are in the US (wiki says so... so it must be true!). That seems pretty important. That is one fifth of the top 100 that are in a single country.

What I don't like about Varoufakis, who had referred to this as a ""negotiating strategy"" in a post a while ago, is that, like Syriza, he's telling people that the Eurozone would have no choice but to keep providing the necessary funds to keep the Greek banks afloat even if Greece would ""tear up the bailout agreements"" and stop servicing its debt. This is an extremely dangerous bet, and for somebody with his credentials to tell people that this would be true is irresponsible.

For practically everybody outside of Greece, there is no question about a Grexit following a win for Syriza almost inevitably. If they win, Europe will play for time for as long as they can while they prepare, then set a final ultimatum, built up political cover by remembering the people how Greece fudged the numbers, didn't implement reforms as agreed and how voters were told what Syriza's announcement to disregard the bailout conditions meant, and then stop paying if Tsipras doesn't jump.

Europe has not made that decision.

We could argue the whole democracy thing over and over again, but we need to remember that democracy applies from all angles.

Is democracy only important when one wants to make their own point of view seem legit? I support Greece and the greek people, but I can also see the angle of the other countries as well.

I view the Grexit as more of a bad thing the moment it happens if it does -- but the most likely outcome, imo is that it will add more urgency to get the whole fiscal union/political union done.. especially if the outcome of Greece leaving is as bad for Greece as we're hearing.

You see.. when a person explains the whole 'transfer' thing to someone.. they're kinda like ""why should we have to pay?"" &lt;-- democracy.

true,captainhamster,EURO,Special Snowflake,"Cheers for the reply! I'll do my best to answer.

I entirely agree that the US has culture, virtually every society does. I understand that the differences between California and Texas, but you're speaking of sub-cultures, which in my view is not fully the focus of the discussion. I appreciate that they add flavour and variety, but sub-cultures are not, arguably, substantial enough.

Language is far from the only criterion required for cultural diversity, but I do believe it is a strong component thereof. It is not required, but can play a big role, either as a product of or catalyst for cultural diversity.

I agree that Europe has similar roots in some places, but time is *exactly* what makes the difference. I realise it's an incredibly arrogant argument, but vast amounts of time truly is almost essential for large cultural diversity. 

My argument is not that there isn't such a thing as being 'European', my argument is that a potential European identity has the opposite structure of the American identity.

As to the 'Americanised' point, my argument is that, in a globalised world, because some aspects are present, does not make it an adoption of culture. This goes for both the EU and the US.

Your point about it being relative is exactly what i'm trying to say: 226 years does not provide enough time (in most circumstances) for incredibly varied cultural diversity.

As to what Europe has done the past 100 years to merit a most visited Museum - that's frankly a ridiculous point. I'd argue that there are many, many places (inside and outside of Europe) that have done things warranting such a museum. For European Examples, it could be historical such as the World Wars (not limited to Europe, of course), it could be artistic, such as modern movements (cubism, expressionism, bauhaus). But the question itself is moot, what has 'Europe' done? Europe doesn't do anything in that sense, peoples and governments do, and that doesn't mean others haven't done it as well.

I think you're seeing my post as an attack on the US - I've gone to length to try to point out that the US absolutely has culture, but it's an unfair comparison to compare it to the EU, it would be more suitable to compare the US to Germany, for instance. Your point that it's not fair is exactly what i'm trying to say - the historical time frame does, in some regards, inherently mean that the EU is more diverse, as there has been more time for different cultures and ideas to establish themselves.

- As to the museums, 50 of the top 100 are in the EU, but once again, it's not the most relevant of comparisons. It's turning too much into a pissing contest, which is not at all the point that I was trying to get across.


The bottom line is, Yes, I find the EU much, much, much more diverse culturally speaking than the US.  Especially if you take concepts such as High and Low culture in mind (sounds more offensive than it is). Nevertheless, too many see it as a contest.

Incidentally, I've posted something [along those lines](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/v3kxw/how_greece_squandered_its_freedom/c51dpxc?context=3) just a few minutes ago. 

Public opinion, at least here, is that Greece should have to exit the euro if they don't stick to the agreements, at 83%. I don't think a majority of them has a decent understanding about what this would mean, though. 

&gt; You see.. when a person explains the whole 'transfer' thing to someone.. they're kinda like ""why should we have to pay?"" &lt;-- democracy.

Yeah, that's why I very much prefer a representative democracy to a direct one. Not because politicians were so much smarter than everybody else, but because they have more time to get informed.  
Of course the gut feeling of the average Joe is that it would be unfair if he had to pay. But we can't realistically have a currency union without a system for transfers, and they need to be permanent and automatic. It would still be a net positive in the long term for the ""donor"" countries.  
I'm sure we agree that we need a proper EU budget to manage those transfers, and more power for the European Parliament to legitimize this democratically. There would be no time to do this properly in case of a Greek exit, and I wouldn't be comfortable with ""sacrificing"" the Greeks for it.

&gt; But once such a thing is in place and everything is running smoothly, people don't really care nor notice that it's going on -- in fact, I'm quite sure quite a lot of people in the USA have no idea that this process is actually happening..

I'm pretty sure they do, at least in Germany the internal transfer payments are well known in the donor states. Especially the West -&gt; East transfers are coming up once in a while. Still, it's pretty much accepted as a fact of life. The same could be said about the Irish and Portugese bailout, though.

National language then? If we are talking about languages in the countries here is a tidbit: There is NO official language in the USA. There are loads of tongues spoken within it's borders. It is just as important that from Mexico to the very tip of South America only 1 country does not speak Spanish as their 1st language but how has that affected cultural diversity? It hasn't. Many of the similarities among these countries are (for lack of a better term) ""human similarities"". The same ones you can find going from Germany to Italy.

&gt;As to what Europe has done the past 100 years to merit a most visited Museum - that's frankly a ridiculous point.

It isn't. Of the top 100 Museums in the list nearly all, if not all, depend mostly on art and exhibitions that are quite old and therefore historic.

What I mean to say is that in the last 100 years there has been just as much in one place than in the other. I said ""Europe"" to allow any of the countries to participate in the example. Say: Romania has a modern art museum that is in the top 100 most visited.

I asked it because if there is such a difference in the ""amount"" of cultural diversity then there should have been a lot more being created, done, and made famous in one place than the other. However, that, as far as I know, is not really the case. (Hence the question.)

&gt;I think you're seeing my post as an attack on the US - I've gone to length to try to point out that the US absolutely has culture, but it's an unfair comparison to compare it to the EU, it would be more suitable to compare the US to Germany, for instance. Your point that it's not fair is exactly what i'm trying to say - the historical time frame does, in some regards, inherently mean that the EU is more diverse, as there has been more time for different cultures and ideas to establish themselves.

I'm not. I try to point that out as soon as I started my post. Is it more diverse because the ideas and cultures are more entrenched? That is the difference time has made. It has allowed them to entrench themselves. Meanwhile there is a variation in ideas and culture quite present on the other side of the ocean but they simply change more regularly. Is 50 fixed ideas more diverse than 50 constantly changing ones?

&gt; Your point that it's not fair is exactly what i'm trying to say - the historical time frame does, in some regards, inherently mean that the EU is more diverse, as there has been more time for different cultures and ideas to establish themselves.

I know. Hence my PS ""I find the topic interesting"". Still though, I think the US gets the short end of the unfair stick when it comes to ""culture"" too often. It is the comic strip stereotype of the fashionable smoking Frenchman reading a novel vs the hot dog eating flag waving backwards cap wearing American. 

Currently, as they are now, without counting on history to help out: The difference and diversity of the people living within the EuroZone and the USA is similar (or almost) in it's diversity. Not historical culture. Present culture. Why? As I ended my last post: Because the US has bits and pieces of all the EuroZone in it and they affect the states and places they live in immensely. The joke that New Jersey is sometimes called the Dominican Republic of New Jersey or Miami is known as Little Cuba goes to show just how diverse it is.

If we want to get very strict... Then, I guess, yes... the US does not have much NATIVE culture (for historical reasons...). It is a country of immigrants for the most part and they took their culture with them. Within many parts the US you can find just as much variation in population as you can in the EuroZone. Is that it then... the real question is the state of ""NATIVE"" cultural diversity?

&gt;My argument is not that there isn't such a thing as being 'European', my argument is that a potential European identity has the opposite structure of the American identity.

I'm not sure what this means. Identity structure? Sorry. Don't understand. :/

&gt;Nevertheless, too many see it as a contest.

I see it as ""I don't want anyone to win the race since it isn't the race but stop calling the same kid ""slow"" all the time.""

&gt;Yes, I find the EU much, much, much more diverse culturally speaking than the US.

After hearing about the amazing differences and all that about Europe I wanted to live here. Got here. Been living here for the better part of a decade. Love to travel. Bottom line for me: Depending on how you want to view it then it can either be very diverse or not so much. You can split the zone up in ""roots"" and notice how ""similar"" everything is if you really want to. Unfair and sad way to look at it.

I love it though. Planning to live the rest of my days here.

I tend to dislike this definition (and prefer the anthropological one) because the anthropological one is merely descriptive, while the other is a construct (that grew, in part, out of Nationalism) and so much of that definition is irrelevant to the question at hand, namely whether the way people behave day-to-day in various parts of the EU are more or less different than the day-to-day behaviors of various Americans.

I would agree that European cultures are more diverse than American cultures, but not for the same reasons that you stated. Linguistic and political divisions are important parts of cultural diversity in Europe,  but only inasmuch as they acted as barriers to interaction. A language is just a set of symbols, and two people living similar lives but speaking different languages are not truly diverse. Cuisine, if you mean the daily foods of everyday people, is relevant. The foods prepared by 4-star chefs probably isn't. Paintings in museums may be a point of pride for your countrymen, but again it is largely irrelevant to everyday life.

This, I think, is why Europeans are often surprised when Americans claim that they have similar levels of diversity: Europeans are surrounded by their 'National myths' that paint a Frenchmen as distinct from a Spaniard in ways that, when you get down to it, aren't really relevant. You are different in other ways that you don't focus on much. In America, we share the same national myth, so this clears the way for us to examine the patterns and rhythms of everyday life that make us distinct. Thus, we are infuriated when someone typecasts the American, because it is, from our perspective, as bizarre as claiming all Europeans drink nothing but wine and are socialists. 

PS. There of course historical forces that are relevant to cultural diversity, but it is important that we focus only on those that are relevant today. I would argue that America has more cultural diversity than any single European state (except perhaps Russia) for several reasons. One is the recent and asymmetric arrival of culturally diverse immigrant groups. Another is the vastness of America,  which has acted as a barrier to cultural exchange to an extent. Finally, Americans have a certain obsession with newness,  probably related to the fact that we lack the ancient shared history of other countries. Thus, we have a way of generating diversity out of thin air at a rapid pace.",0,1339859384,null,0,false,0,c51edzk,t3_v4ljv,t1_c51edzk,t1_c51bshg,null,1429157102,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16

I don't know if you've traveled the US or not, but even just talking to people you can see *significant* cultural differences. What the US does have is a sense of *apparent* unity through media. That's not the same as actual cultural unity. 
  
Europe is certainly more heavily populated and more dense with people than the United States, there's no arguing that it's not. The US has slightly more than half the population of Europe (309m vs 595m), but they're spread over an area 1.6 times its size. There are areas of the country that are *very* insular, and which do not have the same diversity of imported cultures that you find in other areas. You wouldn't know that if you just know the States through television, though, or if you've just been to one or two major metropolitan areas. 
  
The ancient histories of the States belong to people who were more or less wiped out, leaving behind a few scattered groups and genes. We don't have thousands of years of war on this continent sculpting empires, that much is certainly true. To artificially unify us, though, is to discredit the diversity of regional cultures. Colorado is not New York, and New Jersey is not Arizona. There are different values in Massachusetts and North Carolina, different laws. You can spend years in jail in one state for something that is completely legal in another, and both populations support their version of the law, because they deal with things differently. People in the US can find it kind of discouraging when Europeans dismiss these immense cultural differences out of hand as if they didn't exist, when anyone who's been around a bit will tell you that they most certainly do. There may be more noticeable differences between European countries than States in the Union, such as languages, and a longer, more complex history, but to imply that we're a ""largely homogeneous entity"" would be equally ignorant and insulting.

Tout le monde a le droit de chercher du travail en France. Mais avant de recruter un étranger extra-européen, il faut que l'entreprise ait déjà cherché à recruter un Français ou un Européen. Il existe une liste de métiers ""à forts besoins de recrutement"" qui passent outre cette nécessité. Guéant l'avait modifié de quelques métiers et avait pondu une circulaire pour en gros dire à tout le monde : ""okay, on suit la Loi, désormais, bien bien violemment. Durcissons le dispositif actuel"". Hollande n'a fait que revenir à la situation pré-Guéant, bien nauséabonde, sans pour autant changer le fond de la situation.

Voir ce vieil article du monde :
http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2011/07/25/le-liste-des-metiers-ouverts-aux-etrangers-reduite-de-moitie_1552691_3224.html

La liste qui fut modifiée et revenu à la normale, si j'ai bien compris (tout se fait un peu dans le bordel, en ce moment) :
http://www.service-public.fr/actualites/001133.html

En gros : Guéant y allait vraiment comme un bourrin. Ce n'étaient pas les pauvres petits immigrés des classes sociales inférieures qui étaient principalement touchés, mais des immigrés qui feront sûrement partie des salariés les 20% ou 10% les mieux payés de France. Issus de grandes écoles, d'écoles d'ingé, etc.
Même à droite, ça gueulait à ce sujet, et chez le patronat. Voir des jeunes issus de grandes écoles et de futurs cadres dirigeants manifester, c'était comique mais un peu absurde.

D'ailleurs, c'est pour cela qu'on ne parlait quasiment jamais ""d'immigrés"", même si toute la bien-pensance pensait qu'il s'agissait principalement de l'immigration prise dans son ensemble. Non. Les journalistes parlaient plus généralement ""d'étudiants étrangers"". Je vous assure que ces derniers n'avaient strictement rien à voir avec ceux qu'on parque actuellement dans des ""camps de rétention"". Ils avaient plus à voir avec votre patron à qui on pourrait refuser demain un travail qu'avec une population cherchant désespérément à fuir des conditions extrêmes dans leurs pays, hein. 
D'ailleurs, c'est ce qui est drôle. Si on connaissait certaines personnes concernées par ce dispositif, cela donnait du ""au lieu de commencer à bosser pour 40 000 par an en France, on va être forcé de partir dans d'autres pays... mais c'est pas grave, le Québec sera très accueillant pour des jeunes comme nous"". Ils n'étaient pas pris au piège, hein. Ils font partie des 20-10% les plus riches, que ça soit chez nous ou dans leurs pays.

Après, j'ai rien contre cette abrogation en elle-même. J'ai des amis concernés.

true,Nesnesitelna,UNSA,United States,"The real difference is how the United States intentionally homogenizes itself culturally.  People in California and New York speak the same language, can't be identified by physical features, and are generally hard to tell apart.  I think that's in large part because America successfully (or more successfully than any other nation in history, if nothing else) assimilates people of an incredible variety of cultures from all over the world.  The countries of Europe, in my experience, are less interested in adopting your cultural practices, if they tolerate immigrants at all, they expect you to adopt their way of life (now, that's not to say there isn't a ""this is America, we speak American!"") attitude in some places in the U.S., but it's much more prevalent in Europe.

I remember recently after I'd arrived in the Czech Republic to study for a year, my Czech was awful (still is, honestly), but I had a translator with me, and she helped me ask a store clerk to buy a tram ticket.  As we walked out of the store, an old woman called out after us and started saying something to me I couldn't understand for about a minute.  When I asked the girl who was showing me around what the woman said, she told me ""well, to put it nicely, she thinks you should learn Czech.""

To some extent, Europe is like the United States in the sense that geographic proximity has some role to play.  Arizona and New Mexico, for example, are pretty similar, as are Wyoming and Montana or Tennessee and Kentucky.  Those have similar cultures, backgrounds, and demographics.  You'll find similar things in Europe: Spain and Portugal, Denmark and Sweden, or Czech Republic and Slovakia.  In the case of Europe, though, the small distinctions add up.  In each of those three examples, the people of each country speak slightly different languages from the country they are paired with, but notably completely different languages from the other pairs.  I don't think the intra-state and intra-national idiosyncrasies, however, are very dissimilar.  Certain states have large religious minority populations, for example, Mormons in Utah, Idaho, and Arizona.  Many European nations have similar occurances.  In that sense, I think they're similar.  The differences are more in how the United States values its homogeneity first, then its diversity as being subservient to that common American bond, while European nations very much value their own distinct culture, and that's why it's so much more prominent and remains more diverse.",0,1339862850,null,0,false,0,c51ezf7,t3_v4ljv,t1_c51ezf7,t3_v4ljv,null,1429157381,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

I've always lived in Massachusetts, but I've been to New York, New Jersey, Vermont, New Hampshire, Virginia, DC, Philadelphia, Maryland, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maine, Delaware, and Colorado. I've also been to Quebec a couple times. There are some subtle differences between people in all those Eastern states, as well as some more significant political differences, but New England is, really, largely culturally homogeneous. Not so in Colorado. Colorado was different. It *felt* very different. The people were different, the scenery was *entirely* different. Language aside, to me, New York and Boston feel as different from Denver as they do from Montreal. People aren't the same. Politically, Colorado is very much like some of the more liberal areas of New England, but culturally it feels very different, and it's a *completely* different landscape. I didn't know what flat meant and I didn't know what high meant until I went to Colorado. Not even Quebec's tundra can do plains like Colorado. 
  
In addition to actually going places, I used to be a telephone research interviewer, doing contract work for the Centers for Disease Control, Pew Research Center, and other organizations. I called hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country, but mostly from California, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, Texas, Arizona, Alabama, the Carolinas, Tennessee, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Kansas. So pretty much most of the states I haven't been to, as well as a few calls to all the others barring Alaska and Hawaii.
  
The cultural differences between New England and the Southern states as well as the Midwestern states are *immense*. There's a *huge* emphasis on religion down south that just doesn't exist in New England. It exists in the midwest too, and I did see a *little* of it in Colorado, but it's not the same as down South. It's not just  religion either. There's a strong distrust for government coupled with an equally strong patriotism and sense of self-reliance that's rather different from its equivalent in the Northeast and much more mainstream. At the same time they're some of the most polite people I've ever spoken with, and I'd probably move down there if they'd quit talking about God and Obama being a Muslim socialist. 
  
Largely meaningless personal experience aside, the biggest indicator of cultural differences is major differences in laws. Say, laws about the death penalty, or the criminalization of various drugs, or laws about birth control and abortion, or amendments to state constitutions endorsing or denying gay marriage.

I live in a country that is considered devoid of culture because all of it's neighbors have a rich artistic and indigenous history that lives to this day. In no way does that mean this country has no culture. It just means the shallow won't see it because they think culture is all on the surface to be found without any effort.

Also, not all American culture is imported. I don't think you could identify much in Europe with Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and the like. I don't doubt you could find comparisons though. Part of California culture could be equated to some European cultures, but they weren't necessarily informed by them. Try finding a lawyer leaving his office at 1pm to go surfing on the East Coast. 

The immigration debate alone in the U.S. shows great cultural divides. The East Coast almost cares not at all about the debate. Border states have many people practically frothing at the mouth to eject foreigners. Part of that is due to how affected each are, but part of it is also history. People that are different were not always welcome in some part of the U.S. Meanwhile the East Coast has a rich immigrant history. Anyone that equates culture to art, language, and dress will completely miss that cultural difference and see it as only political. In this case it's the culture that informs the politics. 

I agree with most of your post. Especially the idea that as you have to actually work to find some cultural differences in the States as an outsider, you also have to work to find cultural similarities in Europe. 

edit: I forgot an important point. For many years in the U.S. and still to do this day in some circles it was considered very important for some immigrants to blend in as best they could as a means of survival and opportunity. Some purposely gave up their ancestral heritage. I've never gotten the impression that is as widespread in Europe for those that do move around. 

Of course the easy example I see living in neither area but in a community of ex-pats is that many Europeans come from a village there family has been in for thousands of years. And in some it is frowned upon to leave that village, let alone the country. Americans have much more freedom to leave without having the fear of judgement. A lot of cultural differences could be tied to that one big yet mostly hidden cultural phenomenon.

Und zur Kritik an der fehlenden politischen Berichterstattung während der Sportübertragungen:

Erst einmal sind ARD und ZDF vertraglich an das Sendematerial der UEFA gebunden. Die öffentlich-rechtlichen Sender können da genausowenig selber aussuchen was sie während der Spiele senden, wie die anderen internationalen Fernsehstationen auch.

Zum anderen, und das ist meine persönliche Meinung, denke ich, dass bei solchen sportlichen Großereignissen die Politik im Hintergrund zu stehen hat. Ich kann es nicht nachvollziehen, warum die UEFA unbedingt in die Ukraine wollte (oder die FIFA nach Russland und nach Quatar). Das sind sicherlich teilweise politisch motivierte Entscheidungen gewesen. Zu diesen politischen Entscheidungen kann jeder seine Meinung haben, ich schaue aber sicherlich keinen Fußball um etwas über die Lage in der Ukraine zu hören.

Und schließlich finde ich gerade die deutsche Haltung gegenüber Tymoschenko hochgradig fragwürdig. Ja, die Dame hatte eine fragwürdige Gerichtsverhandlung und der ukrainische Staat ist in ungefähr so ""lupenrein demokratisch"" wie Russland und Parteisekretär Putin. Aber auch Tymoschenko ist kein Unschuldslamm und sie als reines Opfer darzustellen, wie das die deutsche Medienlandschaft seit einiger Zeit macht, ist auch falsch.

Non.

J'ai juste affirmé qu'il ne s'agissait aucunement d'une amélioration pour l'ensemble des immigrés, et qu'il ne s'agissait absolument pas d'une mesure positive pour l'ensemble d'entre eux. C'est l'arbre qui cache la forêt.

Tu verras que je ne me positionne pas comme de droite ou de gauche, par exemple dans ce subreddit. Par contre, je pense qu'il est nécessaire de ne pas se laisser aveugler par une présentation médiatique tronquant la réalité.

Quant à un rapport différent envers une classe ou une autre, oui, elle existe. La bourgeoisie et la solidarité entre élites existe. La surexposition médiatique d'une minorité faisant partie d'une élite existe. Cette circulaire ne concernait qu'une toute petite minorité du flux d'immigrants français. On en a plus parlé que des accidents internes aux CRA, ou même que l'incendie de l'un d'entre eux.

Je parle juste d'une justice à deux vitesses, d'un apitoiement à deux vitesses, et d'une solidarité des classes politiques (et bourgeoises, accessoirement) avec des problèmes sociaux... à deux vitesses.

Qui parle de corporatisme ? Pas moi. Il s'agit du même mécanisme mental et sociologique qui nous fait nous apitoyer bien plus sur une catastrophe à mesure de sa proximité, par exemple. Dans ce cas précis, il est logique que la classe politique (droite ou gauche) ou même que les médias (idem) soient très très sensible au cas de cette poignée d'étudiants d'élite (parce que ce n'est pas non plus n'importe quels étudiants, hein... faut le rappeler, ça aussi) plutôt qu'aux populations emprisonnées sur notre territoire dans des Centres de Rétention, refoulés aux frontières, et pris dans un système kafkaïen. 
Même s'ils sont bien plus nombreux.
Même s'ils n'ont pas d'autres issues (a contrario des étudiants refoulés).

Encore une fois, je ne critique pas cette action. Je la trouve très bien. Moi-même, je suis bien plus proche de ces élites que des sans-papiers emprisonnés en attente de leur déportation vers l'étranger. 

Ce que je critique, c'est la lecture complètement biaisée de cette abrogation. Elle légitime encore plus le système d'immigration à deux vitesses actuelle : d'un côté ceux qui peuvent se permettre de venir bosser en France (ayant l'argent pour faire des hautes études, principalement) sans encombre, de l'autre ceux qui ont le droit à un système kafkaïen, au mépris, à être invisibles, aux CRA, aux reconduites à la frontière, à la traque, la peur d'être renvoyés dans leurs pays, les difficultés pour s'intégrer économiquement...

""Donc maintenant en plus d'être de droite ou de gauche, on doit obligatoirement être soit bourgeois ou pauvre, dés qu'on a un diplôme après-bac, on fait partie de l'élite et donc forcément complice du système.""

Déjà, pour le droite/gauche, je ne vois pas où tu veux en venir. Je me suis déjà exprimé dans le coin à ce sujet. Je trouve stupide cette dichotomie. Elle est totalement fluctuante et subjective.
Bourgeois/pauvre : là, c'est plus difficile. Sociologiquement, oui, il existe des groupes ou des classes sociales, et une capacité des membres de ces dernières à se reconnaître affiliés à celles-ci, ainsi qu'à faire valoir leurs intérêts de classe. Il ne faut pas s'appeler Bourdieu pour s'en rendre compte, même au quotidien. 

Sur la lutte des classes, Warren Buffett a fait une superbe déclaration sur le sujet. ""Il y a une guerre des classes, c’est un fait, mais c’est ma classe, la classe des riches, qui mène cette guerre, et nous sommes en train de la gagner"".

C'est plus fin que ça, bien entendu. Personne n'a de carte de ""bourgeois"", ""prolétaire"", ""classe moyenne"", etc. 
Sociologiquement, l'un des plus grands fossés en France tient, en plus du capital économique (surtout le patrimoine, plus que les revenus, bien entendu !), du capital culturel. Oui, la ""distinction"", la violence symbolique exercée sur les non-diplômés, le mépris du bas-peuple qu'il faut savoir diriger avec ""pédagogie"" (l'un des mots les plus atroces lorsqu'il sort de la bouche d'un homme politique... putain... le CPE, quelle période débile, il fallait ""expliquer""...), le paternalisme, ça existe.

Considering only the countries participating in Euro 2012:

* Poland: was a communist state until 1989, only became democratic within the lifetimes of some of the players at that tournament
* Greece: birthplace of modern democracy, but had governments overthrown by coups as recently as the mid 1970s
* Russia: part of the USSR until 1991, every single player on the Russian team was born while Russia was part of the USSR
* Czech Republic: a country that has only existed since 1993, so even their U-21 team were born into a country called Czechoslovakia
* Netherlands: a former major world power but one of many in Europe that was controlled by the Nazis in WWII
* Denmark: a long-time constitutional monarchy, also briefly controlled by the Nazis in WWII
* Germany: became a single country again in 1990, after the birth of the players on the team, sordid Nazi history in WWII that still affects them today
* Portugal: another former massive colonial force, but only since the 1970s has it been a stable free country
* Spain: yet another former massive colonial empire, and yet another country that has only been democratic since the mid 1970s
* Italy: another country with a sordid history in WWII, and economic and political problems including assassinations lasting into the early 1980s, just outside the age of the Euro players
* Republic of Ireland: has a complicated history with the UK, but has been a fairly stable country in modern times
* Croatia: has only existed since 1992, every player playing for Croatia was born in a communist Yugoslavia, and hostilities in the civil war only stopped in 1995.
* Sweden: another relatively stable country, but also one with a complicated history in WWII
* England: a relatively stable modern democracy that hasn't changed much recently, but one with strong memories of WWII
* France: one of the birthplaces of modern democracy, but also one of the major battlegrounds of WWII
* Ukraine: part of the USSR until the 1990s, again, within the lifetime of many players.

In general, just from the Euro 2012 teams, there are countries that have only come into existence within the lifetime of the players representing them.  There are countries that only overthrew dictatorships less than 40 years ago.  There were countries that were bitter enemies in WWII.  Not to mention the dozens of different languages, cultures, foods, etc.

The US has been a cohesive country with one major language with only minor internal strife since the end of the US Civil War in 1865.  And they're not all that good at soccer.

There's really no comparison.

Ben non.
C'est comme si tu me disais qu'il y a une redistribution de l'Etat qui avantage plus le cadre sup', et une autre qui avantage plus le RSAiste. Si l'Etat fixe des règles différenciées pour l'un et l'autre, c'est bien qu'il y a une raison. Lorsque l'Etat décide de faciliter l'achat de propriétés ou de réduire l'impôt sur le revenu pour les plus riches, il avantage avant tout les classes ayant le plus de revenus. Le RSAiste n'y verra rien, là-dedans.

Même chose pour l'immigration. Ce n'est pas ""le même combat"". L'Immigration, comme un tout homogène, ça n'existe pas. Tu ne peux pas mettre sur le même plan (cas extrêmes) un multimilliardaires russes et un type fuyant une guerre sans aucune possession. Dans le cas des milliardaires, on leur facilite l'accès à Nice (véridique...). Dans le cas des prolos étrangers et sans possessions, on créé spécialement des lois pour qu'ils puissent avoir la chance de se faire expulser rapidement.

C'est se baigner dans une illusion que de croire que ""les Etrangers"" est un tout homogène et qu'ils sont tous traités de la même façon à partir d'un droit ne faisant aucune différence entre riches, pauvres, diplômés et non-diplômés.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You are certainly right. As an American visiting just four countries on the European continent this spring (England, France, Germany, Switzerland), the cultural differences between each country were astounding and fascinating.

However, from my viewpoint, I would caution against viewing the United States, culturally, as a collection of states. Rather, the US can culturally be broken down into regions, and the differences become more distinct. Some of these regions collections of states but some can be entirely within a state or cross over state lines. For example, Southern California is vastly different from New England, which in turn is radically different from Texas.

I would say that the culturally differences between Europe and the United States are that Europe manages to have many more cultural differences in a small area like Switzerland, and the culture is indeed, as you say, more historically significant. I particularly agree with you saying it would take ""numerous lifetimes"" to study it. I was amazed by how much I learned in my short time in cities like Paris and London, and how much more I have learned since returning home. When I realize that I only visited a small part of Europe, it makes me want to return.

Here, our culture is strongly centralized in the major cities (Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and Austin all have very different cultures, some of it imported), with the surrounding area being very homogenous. To really appreciate American culture, a visitor would have to take a few weeks just to visit New York and Los Angeles. Our culture is much more subtle, and Americans tend to have less culture (perhaps with the exception of music, which is everywhere) in our daily lives.

I have lived in South Carolina and California, visited New York, Washington DC, Virginia, New Jersey, Goergia, North Carolina, Texas, New Mexico, West Virginia, Maryland, and Florida and I can tell you first-hand that each of these states have different cultures. People act different, speak different, sound different. Foods are different, there are different sub-cultures entirely!

It is very difficult to say that places such as South Carolina and California are similar culturally. Sure, there may be some overlapping things such as government and basic english, but both have entirely different dialects and even languages! Ever heard of [Gullah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullah)? Personally, I identify with being a Californian, I have family dating back about 150 years in the state and, prior to that, either Native American (Cherokee), Portugal, or Scotland. But, back to the main point: South Carolina and California have very little in common culturally. The attitudes of the people towards each other are entirely different (I rarely got a hello or even an acknowledgement of my existence in SC, and I have heard from many people that that is the general vibe along the entirety of the east coast) while in California it is almost mandatory for politeness to say hello to someone, EVEN IF THEY ARE A STRANGER! Now, that's not to say people say hello as they are walking along the street in San Francisco to work, but in a supermarket or on a hiking trail if you run into someone one-on-one it's polite to say hello and maybe even start a conversation with them if you two are going down the same way. That *never* happened in South Carolina due to the culture there. Many people *still* cling to the confederacy. I cannot tell you the number of people I have heard wishing the South had won in the Civil war! 

Out here in California, people are much more accepting of various beliefs, ethnicities, etc. Here in the San Francisco bay area I see people from all over the world with different backgrounds all living together in one area. I have seen an African American mother have her children along with friends of white, chinese, indian, and latin american descent follow her around. People don't have stuck up beliefs about their ethnicity/race being better than one another here. 

In the more general cultural aspect: entirely liberal vs conservative values. Different musical tastes (there are musicians and bands out here in California that I had never even heard of on the east coast, and neither had any of my friends!). There are words, phrases, idioms, actions, restaurants, sports, carmakers, etc that are entirely of one region or another. I could go on, but I hope that puts it in a bit more perspective.

true,mamjjasond,UNSA,United States,"I really don't think the cultural differences are comparable as ""more vs less"".  The structure of the cultural landscape is very different in the US than in Europe.  European cultures are roughly defined by regions with strong traditions with a long history.  National identities are relatively strong since, before maybe 100 years ago, people generally did not migrate far away from their birthplace.  Each country has a strong identity to one or a small number of indigenous ethnicities, each one deeply ""baked in"" to its region.   It may be true that, for example, in Strasbourg one may not be sure if they are in France or Germany, but for sure they know they are in Alsace, and not in England or Russia or Greece.

In the US, up until about the 1980s, there were a fair number of distinct cultures which had taken root to various degrees.  I grew up in (what was then) a relatively rural/suburban part of New Jersey.  Most of my classmates were upper-middleclass whites, either WASPs or of some northwest European descent.  I knew several families who lived on a road named after their family, on land settled by some distant ancestor when New Jersey was a colony of Britain, or even before that when it was known as New Netherland and was controlled by the Dutch in the 1600s.

My family, of Italian descent, had moved there from Brooklyn NY before I was born, so at that time I was growing up in a family with an entirely different culture than I was living and going to school in.  My parents were the first generation in my family born in the US, so our family had many traditions from ""the old country"" intact.  All of my grandparents spoke Italian, some exclusively.  So, growing up in NJ, I felt very much like an outsider for a long time.  

You may think it counterintuitive for an Italian to feel out of place in NJ but that's the point.  At one time, the people who lived in NJ were quite different than those who lived in NYC, especially the outer boroughs where the immigrants of the late 19th and early 20th centuries congregated. Over time, people from ""the city"", especially Italians, have flocked to NJ in such numbers that now it's difficult not to find them.  And more recently, over the past 20-30 years, people all over the US (and the world) have been moving to start or keep up with their careers.  NJ is home to many pharmaceutical companies, so the families who live in those parts of the state come from everywhere biotech scientists come from.  Bell Labs is still going fairly strong in Murray Hill, so quite a few top computer scientists have come from all over the world to live and work there ... and so on. 

But there is also a thin veil of an overall cultural identity that overlays everyone in the US, and this national identity has unfortunately been mediated and transformed by 2 major forces which have grown exponentially in the last 20 or 30 years, those being the national media and the rise of national retail and food chains.  The national media (both on tv and at the movies) broadcast a largely fake image of Americanism that tends to have an enormous influence, especially on kids, smoothing out any sharp differences into one bland homogeneous identity which is carefully emulated, especially outside the family household.   Additionally, as large stores like Walmart have come into every town in the country, replacing almost every unique establishment in the area, part of the local flavor of each place disappears in favor of that plastic bland uniformity we all know and ... and my case, hate. 

However there are still many pockets of unique culture around the US.  Just off the top of my head: the Gullah people of South Carolina, the Pennsylvania Dutch of (surprise!) Pennsylvania, the Cajuns of southern Louisiana, the Scandinavian subculture of Minnesota, certain loci of German cultures in Texas and around the Great Lakes, southwestern culture around Santa Fe NM, not to mention the indigenous cultures of Hawaii and Alaska.

Hi, I came to Paris on a spontaneous 2-week solo trip two years ago.  I fell in love with Paris, and when I returned to the States, I felt so sad.  I felt as if I had left part of myself back there, that I belonged in Paris, that I had to get back. I didn't heed the advice of one of my good French friends whom I'd spent a lot of time with while in Paris: ""*Visiting* another land and *living* in another land are very different things.""

I'm 24 and in theatre, so I decided I would start looking into theatre schools in Paris.  I was particularly interested in l'école international de théatre Jacques Lecoq.  I did whatever I could to get back to Paris.  In fact, I became an au pair, and fought tooth and nail to get here.  I spent an entire year going to school full time and working an average of 50 hours per week. 

I got here last August, so I've been here for 10 1/2 months now.  I'll tell you what, saying that I'm miserable would be a dramatic statement, but I'm not happy.  I've made friends here, they're wonderful people, especially our fellow Paris Redditors.  I work for a wonderful family.  My job is hardly a job, my life is pretty good... except for the fact that I really hate living here and I just want to go home.  Every morning, I wake up, and I want to go home.  Every night, I go to bed, and I want to go home.  I want to go home.  In spite of how much I'll miss the awesome friends I've made, I can't wait to go home.  I have 75 days left and I'm marking them off the calendar with anticipation as they go by.

I encourage people to travel and experience different cultures.  I think it's very important.  I am glad to have this experience.  But I wish that this had been a 3 or 5-month experience, rather than a 13-month sentence.  

Research your opportunities, consider what you really want, and what your options are.  I wish I had stayed in the States and continued my path towards an MFA program.  Now I feel like I have to start over when I get back.  If you have your heart absolutely set on Paris, and you truly believe that this is the city for you, that this is your home, then I recommend coming here on a longer trip, but not a year.   Give yourself a stronger taste--be an au pair for 6 months.  The culture shock will really get to you between the 6 and 8-month mark.

Also, read about culture shock, the process, and the symptoms.  Trust me.  In spite of loving Paris, I went through a long period of culture shock.  It's not what you may think it is.  I spent the entire winter sitting in my room feeling depressed, and I had no idea why.  I'm not exaggerating.  There was a time when I didn't go outside of my building for 2 1/2 weeks, and I am a highly sociable person who loves human interaction.  I'M IN THEATRE! 

I wish I had read these things before choosing to come to Paris.  I don't mean to be a Negative Nancy, but don't allow yourself to only look at the romantic side of a choice like this.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;You just need to keep into account that the US military is a huge business.

That's probably part of it, but as an American, my experience leads me to believe there is another, far more important factor.  A massive number of Americans fought in Iraq, Afghanistan, or a previous war.  There are veterans everywhere.  In the background of everyone's mind, there's the question, ""Were these wars the right thing to do?  Were they wrong?"" 

When people think about the suffering of a veteran - a lost face, a crippling injury, a person who came home in a box, a mind-altering trauma - and then think that it all might have been for ""nothing,"" or for a bad cause, it creates a very negative emotion.  The veteran and his family/friends would rather find some kind of higher purpose for the veteran's suffering than just say, ""He was a casualty of an unjust war,"" which would be extremely depressing.  Better to be a hero than a sad victim who was also, if the war was unjust, a victimizer.  People with emotions at stake don't want to hear that.  They would rather that their sons, brothers, husbands, and fathers fought for something noble, even if the war itself is morally questionable to them.  So they glorify military service itself - maybe the war's morality is tarnished, but the honor of serving one's country isn't.

The pervasiveness of this mentality has created a kind of ""cult of the soldier,"" in which it is permissible to criticize a war but a massive faux pas to say anything negative about a soldier.  In fact, people now feel the expectation to fall over themselves to thank a soldier for his service because, always in the background, there's the void of the Iraq War.",0,1339874401,null,0,false,0,c51h4r2,t3_v4vqv,t1_c51h4r2,t1_c51e2jx,null,1429158401,20,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,20

true,krattr,null,null,"There is a clear distinction between ""the levels ... are"" and ""the perspective of"". The first is about the reality, the second about the perception (of self, or of others).

Germans perceive themselves as less corrupt, Greeks perceive themselves as more corrupt. German experts say that the German perception is out of touch with reality, as the real number of corruption cases is estimated to be much higher (""a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light""). Also note Germany's position in the Financial Secrecy Index [above](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/v4u47/germany_and_the_future_of_the_euro_1_is_grexit/c51dhdq); corruption is not only about the usual forms (for example, [German doctors and cancer drugs](http://www.welt.de/newsticker/dpa_nt/infoline_nt/brennpunkte_nt/article106161097/Bundesweite-Ermittlungen-gegen-Pharmafirmen-und-Aerzte.html)).

On the other hand, since Greeks perceive themselves as being more corrupt, their relative position in a table regarding perception, constructed with dubious polling methods, would inevitably be higher. This creates a negative climate and maintains a certain rhetoric. The markets and the media need narratives, and everything must fit in boxes of a specific size (hey, it is a known fact that all Italians are members of the Mafia). It doesn't matter if they're right or wrong, as they'll promptly move on and the taxpayers will pay the bill in the end (cue Royal Bank of Scotland, and other ""honest"" and ""too big to fail"" entities). 

For these reasons, comparing what two average business owners in both countries might encounter, does not paint an accurate picture. Since Germany's population is much bigger and there are many multinationals, it would be like comparing apples and oranges. Both are fruits, but they differ. In Germany, you might find much more large-scale corruption (for example, multinationals bribing abroad). But let's not restrict this to Germany. The [European Fraud Survey](http://www.ey.com/GL/en/Services/Assurance/Fraud-Investigation---Dispute-Services/European-fraud-survey-2011--recovery--regulation-and-integrity---Summary-of-findings) finds that ""two-thirds of those interviewed informed us that bribery and corruption are widespread in their country"".

Vor dem Spiel gegen die Niederlande zum Beispiel war ein knapp zehnminütiger Beitrag über die Inhaftierung von Tymoschenko am Spielort der bundesdeutschen Mannschaft, der das Problem auch von der Seite der besuchenden Fans aufarbeitete.

Auch während des Spiels hat der Kommentator mehrmals angesprochen, dass das internationale UEFA Bild solche Sachen wie Pyrotechnik, Flitzer oder eben auch die Grünen Politiker mit ihrem Tymoschenko Spruchband nicht einblendet und sich, zumindestens für einen Sportreporter, kritisch mit dem Thema auseinandergesetzt.

Der Sport steht natürlich trotz allem im Vordergrund und das sind Randerscheinungen. Über Sinn oder Unsinn der Ausstrahlung bei den öffentlich-rechtlichen Sendern kann man durchaus streiten.

From the ignorant flag waving hick to the hipster conscientious objector who only eats free range chickens. Chicago is not like New York. Houston is not like Orlando.

In my experience, the variation is much less than the consistent aspects between parts of the US. Louisiana is different from California, but compared to *any* other country those differences are tiny. I'd consider the variations I've encountered across the US to be roughly similar to those I've encountered in different areas of the UK. There's a distinct difference between a Scotsman and someone from the south east of England, but there's also a great deal of similarity. Broadly speaking, the difference between two British people is tiny compared to the difference between a Brit and a French person or a German person.

I by no means believe it's only a huge business thing. I'm sure there are other factors.

But you can't undermine the willing of the US military business to have the favor of the American people. It's a huge business. And believing that they don't invest money in trying to gain the favor of the American people is just being naive.

What I'm saying is that it's perfectly reasonable that this ""cult of the soldier"" is a vector to gain that support.

&gt; So they glorify military service itself - maybe the war's morality is tarnished, but the honor of serving one's country isn't

You can twist reality as much as you want. But it is what it is. (I'm not saying you  acutally believe that)

America is very far away from Iraq and Afghanistan, so we don't see the true effects of war.  The media doesn't show any of the carnage.  We don't even see pictures of American coffins; I don't know if they are removed from the media by censorship or if there is some kind of ""gentleman's agreement"" not to show them.  Most likely, the military tells the press that any organization which shows the carnage of war will be blacklisted.

This is another lesson the military learned from Vietnam.  No longer are reporters allowed to follow troops into combat and record what actually happens.  The military carefully controls the information that the press can access; all we see are stock photos and extremely limited snapshots of troops who are at ease in a safe location.  The IAmA from the Iraq War machine-gunner is a good example: his post is intended to reveal a major, messy urban battle that wasn't even covered in text format by the US media.

Since the wars are presented in such a sanitized way, most people are not forced by grim reality to accept the true nature of war.
