As a German I always found these radio messages highly annoying and utterly useless. The radio stations cover huge parts of Germany. What are the chances that I will drive through that specific road at that time and I'm listening to a station that broadcasts this nonsense? Practically zero.

This has also almost nothing to do with disobedience. It's just a thing of the radio stations to make you feel connected to them on a buddy level. They sell this as a service, but it is useless for 99,999% of the listeners. And if you have been in Germany you'd know that we always drive about 10km/h over the speed limit. OTOH this only works because most follow the rules. So, yes here obedience is key.

Even if you go into a WG, I think you'll still have to buy some furniture (bed, desk, whatnot), pay the security part the previous flatmate took back (about 500€) and add the bike/transportation/random costs.

I think forcing someone to develop secondary sexual characteristics that don't match up with their internal body image would cause them to be suicidally depressed without that person being chronically depressed due to a (non-hormonal, direct) chemical imbalance, or schizophrenic.  It's a genuinely depressing circumstance, and being depressed is a healthy response to that.

Respect for asking for help.

Generally some good advise that I've read here. Careful if going to the police, perhaps asking the police without specifics, asking what they might do in your situation is a good start there. You don't want a storm in a tea cup. They will be able to tell you more about legal options too.

The ToyTown suggestion is a good idea.

I do strongly agree with going to the Doc and taking some time to feel better and get a plan together is a wise move. It will also give you time to look for jobs. The GP might also have some great advice for you. Just be as honest as possible. I've been really pleased with my GP's in Germany. Make sure you ask the GP about getting to speak to a psychologist, it should be free. It will help, BIG TIME.

I would highly prioritise getting yourself away from the job/situation. If that means going from kitchen to kitchen with you CV asking for a chance to prove yourself.

I would suggest using the money you're spending on booze/fags on a boxing/MMA gym in the area, use it to get fit, make friends, stay focused on something an learn self defence. Should something get violent with your situation, you need to know what to do. Running hard and fast away is normally always the best outcome. Be fitter than your predators!

Du hast also ""so ganz persönlich"" kein Bock auf Halbstarken-Sprache...hängst aber bei Reddit rum. Das wäre dann wohl dein zweites Problem, wenn du glaubst Reddit ist Wikipedia. Die letzten die versucht haben Aggregation in ""journalistisch saubere Meinungposts"" zu wandeln hießen Digg. Davon redet heute keiner mehr.

Bevor du dich also über meine Formulierungen ärgerst, könntest du ja einfach zu Digg gehen. Wenn du solche Aussagen von mir wirklich ernst nimmst, würde ich dich bitten mir mal zu erklären, wie du zu Subs wie jailbait stehst.
Du bist jetzt 4 Jahre auf Reddit und ärgerst dich über so einen Post von mir? Hast du bisher nur /r/de gelesen? 
Niemand kann doch wollen, dass Reddit wie Digg oder Shortnews. Ich will das ganz bestimmt nicht und bin vom deutschen Reddit schon mehr als angekotzt. 
Es gibt 5 Quellen fürs deutsche Reddit: Heise, Golem, Spiegel, FAZ und TAZ.
Wie wärs, wenn man einfach den RSS Feed der paar Dinger aboniert und sich nie wieder auf Reddit blicken lässt? Geil,oder?

Und wie du sicher schon bemerkt hast, habe auch ich hier den Spiegel verlinkt. Gut, der Spiegel ist ein mieses Kampagnenblatt...aber den deutschen Usern scheint es ja wie Heise (das IT Rentnerblatt), Golem (Bullshitbullshitbullshit) usw zu gefallen.

Und da ich an Reddit glaube, werde ich auch weiterhin miese Quellen mit möglichst verkackten Titeln submitten....vielleicht hören die Menschen ja irgendwann auf SPon,Heise,Golem,Stern usw. zu lesen.

Depression itself is the illness to be treated.

Some things cannot be had. I recommend Viktor Frankl's ""Trotzdem Ja zum Leben sagen"", in which he argues that anything can be coped with by ignoring bad emotions and concentrating on the good things in life. He survived Auschwitz with that, so I think he has some street cred.

Sure there is. The primary clinical requirement for psychological disorders is that it causes distress or impairment of daily functioning. It doesn't have to differ from the norm nor does it need to cause social stigma. 

Alzheimer's is a structural and functional failing of the brain, not mere ""forgetfulness."" Even though it has effects on the mental functioning of a patient, it's not a psychosis. Even though it has effects on mood as a person's life is disrupted, it's not a mood disorder to be treated with anti-depressants. 

The causes of transsexualism are not well-studied (small sample sizes willing to undergo extensive testing are the primary problem), but consistent, widespread, and geographically separated failures to treat it by psychotherapy and psychological medication show that it is neither useful nor medically sound to consider it a mental disorder.

&gt;If there are two ways to solve a problem, use the one less likely to cause medical harm. Which, indeed, are psychopharmaka and psychiatric therapies in this case.

This is patently false. ""Corrective"" or ""reparative"" psychotherapy is an overwhelming failure, principally because there's no underlying psychological condition to treat. Being transgender can be *comorbid* with other problems like anxiety, depression, or social phobias, but none of those are necessarily a part of being transgender or needing medical intervention. Those are largely the result of persistent social ostracism and harassment, and problems caused by attempts to improperly socialize a transgender child. 

**The solution that causes the least harm is medically-assisted transition, with earlier intervention yielding consistently better results.** [The relevant major medical associations have all come forward stating such.](http://www.lambdalegal.org/publications/fs_professional-org-statements-supporting-trans-health)

No, not really. Without the suppressive drugs, puberty can begin normally. All they have to do is stop taking them. What you're suggesting is torture. 

You don't have a clue what you're talking about. You have already shown that a few times now. And yet you want to torture someone because you weren't told about hormones when you were 11 -- or so you claim, or because your parents are psychiatrists. It's dumb and  sickening. 

&gt;Medical remedies are something usually not discussed to kids, there is little doctor-&gt;kid communication. It is something that was like that back then, and it is something that I see every other day today.

That is just total BS. Medical remedies are discussed with kids. It depends greatly on the family, kid, and medical condition, but they are discussed. I have already given evidence of this, which you continue to ignore. When I was growing up the doctor spoke to me about what was going on, especially with ongoing medical issues. Maybe you just have shitty doctors? Maybe you weren't intelligent enough to ask? 

Further, that isn't evidence for anything. You think we should ignore the recommended treatment of suppressive drugs and torture a child because ""there is little doctor-&gt;kid communication?"" That is ridiculous and cruel.

Gory details about the execution of William Wallace (over 700 years ago), several paragraphs saying how great Alex Salmond is, saying that Scots believe that Margaret Thatcher deliberately tried to drive Scotland into poverty... it seems a bit one-sided to me.

Anyway aside from that, it is a strange issue. As far as I can see it, Scottish people for the most part don't want independence (around 30% in favour). Most would be interested in the devolution max option. But this needs careful debate - it is not only the Scots that will be affected, but the rest of the UK as well. Scotland's free universities and prescriptions come from a communal purse, even if English people still have to pay even in Scotland.

My impression is that Alex Salmond is a politician with a lot of ambition. Pursuing independence is a great patriotic-sounding pursuit which will earn him a lot of votes. True independence would make him prime minister, which would work out pretty well for him. Devolution max would get him a lot of power. The English politicians, on the other hand, don't want to yield power and are looking after their own interests.

""Youngsters actually begin developing strong gender identities long before middle childhood. A child's awareness of being a boy or a girl starts in the first year of life. It often begins by eight to ten months of age, when youngsters typ­ically discover their genitals. Then, between one and two years old, children become conscious of physical differences between boys and girls; before their third birthday they are easily able to label themselves as either a boy or a girl as they acquire a strong concept of self. By age four, children's gender identity is stable, and they know they will always be a boy or a girl.""

If what you say is true and gender identity doesn't set in until a later age, why do we see so many 3-4 year olds saying they're transgender ie ""mommy i'm a boy""

Yeah kids get sex ed classes and at 11 you think they're going to say to themselves ""Huh the teacher said that typically testosterone has the effect of giving facial hair to genetic males, I wonder if maybe jimmy is transgender because he doesn't have a beard by age 11""

The sad part is that Transsexualism in the USA hasn't been around for more then 20-30 years in a highly studied way. Thus no scientist can say for certain what causes transsexualism or GID, but as you can see MANY psychologists do believe that the evidence points towards gender identity being established early on.

1.  Sit at the front of the train on the side with the platforms, and scan the platform when arriving at each station for people in black jackets in groups of twos or threes.  If you see such a group, get off the train immediately.  This works for the U-bahn better than the S-bahn.

2.  Scan quickly for the same people when boarding a train, as they often ask for the ""zugestiegene Passagiere"" to show tickets, and deboard if you spot someone suspicious.

3.  On buses, carefully profile people.  Usually the ticket checkers will look rather stoic and be middle-aged.  The women will usually be kind of dumpy.  If you get good at it, you can spot them.  The best part about this is that most bus drivers couldn't give two shits if your ticket's valid or not.  Their job is to drive the bus; sure they look, but their FU to the system is getting through the day with as little hassle as possible.

4.  The best way to ride schwarz is to have a ticket which partially covers the journey for a portion of the ride where the Kontrolle is likely to take place (as a rule, it's generally likelier the closer one is to the Stadtmitte, especially it seems on doubly and triply trunked routes)  For example, you want to go somewhere in zone 5, save a few euro by buying a ticket for just zones one through three and make sure you begin your last leg of the journey within the validity of the ticket.

true,DocTomoe,GERM,Germany,"&gt; You think that these doctors want to turn boys into girls because they feel that it will forward their cause and show the world that liberalism is the way to go or something?

I do see that in the case discussed, three sets of doctors are mentioned, one who had contact to the kid, and those docs did come to the conclusion that no treatment was necessary. 

I also do note that I have a regular contact to about 400-600 people, and of those people one (who is a very good friend) identifies him/herself as a transsexual. While in here, suddenly, ""transsexual"" people plop out by the dozens once I hint at putting a suicidal kid not on suicide watch but on hormone therapy might be a wrong thing.

So, call me paranoid, but yes, I think the rather liberal reddit hive-mind is in this thread, trying to scream me down, and this involves the occassional socketpuppeering. 

&gt; That being said it is irrelevant because we're not arguing about the safety of the drug, We can find a new drug that will do the same thing, more safely.

And until we do that, we risk people's lives for something not medically necessary? Asked a little more bluntly: Would you, should your daughter insist of it at age 11, pay her a boob job, with all the risks involved?

&gt; Causes of Transsexualism

A well-sourced theories page. You might notice just how much larger the ""medical"" part is, and how underdeveloped the psychological theories part is (it even tells us that TS people dislike psychological theories), though I have no doubts about transsexuality being an immensly interesting field of research for anything that starty with psych*.

I am not stating the article is biased. I just point out that it likely lacks the depth it could have.

&gt; 10 Year Old Jackie, Born a Boy, Happier as a Girl

&gt; Gender Identity Disorder (Link #1)

A quick infosheet by a government facility. Doesn't tell us much new, only adds symptoms not related to the case at hand.

&gt; Gender Identity Disorder (Link #2)

BBC. Tells us nothing much new. Has the following nugget that has been denied again and again in this thread: 

&gt; Gender identity and sexuality are undoubtedly linked, and so issues about gender identity during childhood and adolescence can be a common experience among gay people growing up. But among that small group who continue to have gender identity disorder into adulthood, the question of their sexual orientation is irrelevant.

Which means we now have two groups:

1. True trans kids, who grow up to be transsexuals, the minority
2. Trans kids who actually are gay and switch back to their original, biological gender, the majority

The solution, it had been stated, was to wait for a few years, to chemically slow their development down, because they might, you know, actually be trans.

&gt; Gender Dysphoria Treatment

The Wikipedia article I have quoted from earlier. Has the following, unfortunately unsourced, nugget: ""It should be noted, however, that such blocking of growth hormones may cause significant detrimental musculo-skeletal problems if done for a prolonged period of time""

&gt; If what you say is true and gender identity doesn't set in until a later age, why do we see so many 3-4 year olds saying they're transgender ie ""mommy i'm a boy""

That has been explained in the BBC link: Mostly, they're actually homosexual.

&gt; Yeah kids get sex ed classes and at 11 you think they're going to say to themselves ""Huh the teacher said that typically testosterone has the effect of giving facial hair to genetic males, I wonder if maybe jimmy is transgender because he doesn't have a beard by age 11""

I have been snarky with that comment because someone wanted to make me believe that somewhere on this planet there are superkids who can wrap their heads around highly-complicated concepts of biochemistry at age 11. I am sorry if I hit the wrong guy.

I can only talk about the sex ed we got at age 11, and that was mostly ""where do babies come from"". Hormones have been on the schedule years later. 

&gt; but as you can see MANY psychologists do believe that the evidence points towards gender identity being established early on.

Psychologists also tried to treat a lot of other stuff which later turned out to be perfectly healthy. They even invented illnesses.

I am *not* saying transsexualism doesn't exist. What my basic point is is that given a simple risk/reward analysis, the kid in the original article rightfully should be put in psychiatry for having shown suicidal-depressive tendencies and should *not* undergo hormonal delay of puberty, for the simple fact that there is no risk of life involved.

The point is: In Germany, you do not get the choice *not* to get into therapy. Once a doctor decides you are a danger to yourself, you immediately lose that right, and you are brought to the psychiatric ward. Doctors are legally punishable if they even hear someone talking about suicide and not getting him or her to the hospital. It's Landesrecht, and I'd have to look up the local Berlin law about this, but it is there.

If there is this diagnosis beyond any reasonable doubt from the majority of independently-working therapists, not only would I advice not only to delay puberty, but to make sure Alex grows up in her prefered gender phenotyp to begin with, which in this case probably means going all the (hormonal, non-surgical) way immediately.

Yes, so they can treat her for her obvious signs of Gender Dysphoria and the trauma inflicted by her father for forcing her to behave according to the gender he has assigned her to be.  By your logic, the fact that Alan Turing committed suicide was a clear sign that he was insane and greater measures should have been employed to force him to pretend to be a heterosexual.

&gt; the trauma inflicted by her father for forcing her to behave according to the gender he has assigned her to be.

Erm, getting called ""bad-behaved"" for not wanting to wear a soccer shirt is not exactly what causes a trauma in a normal person.

&gt; By your logic, the fact that Alan Turing committed suicide was a clear sign that he was insane and greater measures should have been employed to force him to pretend to be a heterosexual.

Was Alan Turing in psychological distress and thus an ill person? Yes, he was, otherwise he would not have commited suicide. Where you are getting the idea that I am homophobic from?

&gt; The cause of the distress this girl is experiencing

... is completely irrelevant for suicide watch.

&gt; You are entirely ignoring the individual herself and the clear evidence of a fitting diagnosis, based purely on your own personal prejudices.

There is a difference between showing interest in cross-gender toys and expressing extreme discomfort in your birth gender.  GID is much more than simply expressing a desire for a certain role.  

&gt; Of course there is, and that has been prooven again and again.

Even with expensive surgeries and hormone treatment, there will always be lingering damage from testosterone.  And some people will never pass and will always have lingering GID because of lingering male traits brought on by male puberty.

&gt; scambi reddit italy per il baretto sotto casa tua, dove ""tutti"" sono d'accordo con te

Allora, io ho detto la mia, che ti piaccia o no. Di certo non considero reddit italy un baretto. Probabilmente mi sono sbagliato sull'orientamento generale dell'opinione politica del subreddit, e quindi pensavo che sarebbe stato inutile citare vecchi post. Beh, mi sembra che ho il diritto di sbagliare. Sentiti libero di considerarti superiore per questo, io vivo bene lo stesso.

&gt; Eh già, proprio capre questi leghisti

Se ti ho offeso, mi dispiace, e mi scuso con tutti per il tono sprezzante del post (generalmente preferisco lasciare commenti moderati). Avevo però detto ""in maggioranza"". Non disprezzo gente come Maroni o Tosi, e a volte l'opinione di quella che chiamano ""base leghista"" non mi trova in disaccordo. Però, e qui sentiti libero di offenderti, penso che la Lega sia una delle più basse espressioni politiche italiane e mi fa provare vergogna lo spiegare a degli stranieri che si tratta di un partito maggioritario. E poi lasciami levare un sassolino dalla scarpa: il tipo con cui la lega era alleata fino a poco tempo fa ha dato dei coglioni in tv a milioni di elettori del partito avverso. Gli stessi leghisti non perdono occasioni per esprimere il loro disprezzo (in modo elegante, per dio) verso quello che è anche il mio paese.

Magari non sarai neanche l'unico! Sicuramente ho dimenticato alcune regole grammaticali e magari qualcuno trova il mio stile di scrittura orripilante.

Nun, ich hab ihn 'formal' auf das problem angesprochen, und da ich bis dato noch nie was mit anwälten zutun hatte, gefragt was man da tun könnte... Bei dem gespräch stellte sich heraus dass hr Vetter solche probleme nicht unbekannt sind. Alles in allem lief es ziemlich problemlos, und ich denke dass auch dass du schnell merken wirst dass hr. Vetter ein freundlicher geselle ist. Sprich ihn einfach drauf an, der rest ergibt sich von selbst.

Buda castle is worth a look to see how not to restore stuff.

And the great thing about that place is you might just learn that Hungary is a country that is not just like ""hungry"", a bit like turkey.

I would then definitely skip up to Prague to see how to maintain a castle and get stuck into the beer there.  I recommend the Budvar.

The advantage of being out East is that it's inexpensive and if you've just graduated high school, cheap is good.

Then I'd recommend getting to Barcelona.   It's good to see the Segrada Familia.  They might just finish it before you die and then you'd be able to say,

""I saw that place while they were building it.""

There are not many Americans, I'm guessing you're American, can say that about European cathedrals. 

You should also check out the Picasso museum in Barcelona and if you can stop off on the way in Figueras, the Dali museum, which is better.

And the great thing about Barcelona is that just south, 30 minutes on the train is the resort of Sitges.  That's where the people of Barcelona go to do the beach thing because the beaches in Barcelona  are (maybe were, I haven't been there for some time) a bit polluted.

And the great thing about the beach at Sitges is the acreage of cute Catalan chicks with no tops on.   They are gorgeous.

And the other good thing about Sitges is that after a hard day on the beach, you want to get back to Barcelona to party, which is a great place to party.

Whereas Sitges after dark can get a bit ""Bruno"", if you know what I mean.

&gt;Que comprenez-vous à la crise actuelle en Europe?

French media states that while we are victims of american financial institutions and rating agencies, we sure should adopt strict policies to avoid ruinous expenses. 

Our current government beeing right-ish and cowardy tries to make it an excuse for cutting-down social policies rather than tax-breaks on higher revenues...

&gt; Avez-vous été témoins des effets de la crise?

Not directly as I'm working in a quite florishing sector. But overall statistics are bad and getting worse. Unemployment is raising, inflation begining to get worse than usual, and the housing market is also in a bad shape. Not as bad as the american housing market (wich is actually running on forclosures right now, wich didn't happen in France)

I think the bad resentment about the current crisis isn't directly related to the global financial hiccup, wich is systemic, or the numerous errors made while designing the Euro Zone, but is rather caused by numerous errors made in local politics during the past 30 years.

&gt; Grâce à la crise, est-il plus difficile de joindre les deux bouts?

As previously said, I'm not directly concerned thanks to my career choices (IT/Telco architect, FTM). Most impacted people are lower to mid-class, with less and less factories running and an unadapted education system.

&gt; Vous vous inquiétez pour l’avenir?

Might seems weird, but definitely not. Things have to get worst to start getting better. I'm really hopefull in the Internet beeing able to teach the people how full of shit politicians and financial executives currently are. Might take some time, though.

&gt; Qui est responsable de la crise et de la récession?

In french, we call them ""patrons-voyous"" : short-sighted mnagers and politicians, not beeing held accountable for the mess they've put us in, seeking short-term profits rather than building a strong and independent economy.

Those are well accointed with politicians (either liberals or socialists, FTM), also responsible by their laxism.

&gt; Comment était la position de la société française sur la crise de 2008 et sur la crise actuelle?

Back in 2008, local medias pictured the crisis as beeing america-centric : caused by savages, with consequences stopping at our borders (like the Tchernobyl cloud). Local banks' bailout was discreet and not advertised by any media or politician, because it was made by subtle tax-breaks mostly.

Then came the spanish housing crisis, wich was just a speculative bubble like Dubaï's hiccup, and had little if no impact here.

At last, the greek crisis is presented as a pretext to cut-off our social system, and is pictured as a real issue where, in fact, it'll have no practical consequences other than those fabricated by local policies.

&gt; Êtes-vous satisfait des actions du gouvernement français?

Should I say more ? I think those are incompetent cowards, and the next governement will be no more competent nor honest to the people. But as said earlier, things have to get worse before getting better.

Now, about the real resentment of the french people, I think we'd have to wait 'till the upcoming elections to know what went through our brainswashed butheads.

&gt; Est-ce que la Grèce devrait quitter la zone euro?

Tricky one. It's not like you can just change the currency overnight, nor can start over with a blank sheet. Entering the euro-zone is a real commitment, starting by dismantling the national reserve and loosing control over your monetary indices (monetary mass, look for M1, M2 and M3 indexes for major currencies, this is a ~~scarry~~ funny chart).

Now, may it be better for the euro-zone to have Greece left-over ? Well, it would be admitting a faillure in the monetary zone regulation and governance, wich would destroy all remaining trust of the european banks in the eyes of every global financial institution.

On the other hand, current management and policy of the euro-zone is a faillure, and not admitting it would be dishonest if not plain stupid. We need some reform and an agressive increase of the overall M3. Fuck it, that's what the federal reserve makes to finance war and fancy consumption market, let's do it to and screw whoever trusts virtual money. American doggy style.

&gt; Selon vous, quelles sont les solutions possibles à cette crise?

If not growing balls to our politicians, I think there's no possible exit from this global vicious circle (the one put in place with the first wave of ultra-liberal deregulation back in the 1910's).

I'd propose temprary isolationism, seizure of inappropriate financial assets, rebuilding of an industrial production in western Europe... State's labor and nation-wide construction project could be welcome to.

No less than a real shock can change our course, so let's do it boldly for a change.

&gt; A quelle étape sommes-nous de la crise, au début, au milieu, à la fin?

We'd like to think it's going to get better soon and politicians play this song in their election speeches.

What you need to open an access is a ""ND"" (numéro de désignation). It's the last geographical number assigned to this hardlin on the POTS system.

Geographical numbers starts with 01, 02, 03, 04 or 05, depending on the [region](http://img0.encyclopedie-incomplete.com/local/cache-vignettes/L180xH190/Indicatifs_telephonique_France_metropolitaine-71e53.png)

A number starting with 06 or 07 is a mobile, 08 are special numbers (either free or overcharged usually) and 09 are non geographical numbers for voice over IP services like those bundled with triple play DSL offers.

If you don't have a geographical number, you may search on [this site](http://www.pagesjaunes.fr/pagesblanches), click on ""recherche détaillée"" and enter the adress of your appartment. Then look for the name of the previous tenant.

If you really can't find any clue for a geographical number, you may look around your door for a small metalic or plastic plate with a telephone sign and a number on it. It's usually 2 or 3 digits and, coupled with the address, will let France Telecom find out the last known ND for the hardline to this appartment. If you don't find any mark, the appartment number might be enough clue. 

Then you'd better go to a retail ""Orange"" store with a native french speaker (or a really fluent non-native, majoring in french hypocrisy) and ask to _open_ a hardline. During the process you'll ask for the last known number and get lost. Or open the hardline and take a DSL subscription from these morons.

Also, depending of the city you're living in, you may also find alternative way to get an internet plan. Some cities have cable networks with higher bandwidth than DSL, some other have not-for-profit associative ISPs (I'm running one in Toulouse) wich may (or may not) be cheaper and, most importantly, will be able to provide you with *real* help in english. But those rarely provide phone service if you need one. SIP providers like [OVH](http://www.ovh.fr/telephonie/) can be used on a bare internet connection then.

False analogy. I'm no dentist, but the removal of wisdom teeth is a surgery, and any reliable doctor only does this in case of medical problems. A ""crooked mouth"" isn't. Yes, I am aware that perfect teeth are a high good in the States, over here, we are a little more careful with manipulating the teeth for purely cosmetic reasons, as that leads to damage being done to a system that becomes increasingly unstable from age 40 onwards, even with perfect care.

That's a quote from the pinknews.co.uk website, which either has a bad grasp at German, or has manipulated the original text to make the situation seem more dramatic. The [taz.de article](http://www.taz.de/Transsexualitaet-im-Kindesalter/!85899/) reads as this:

&gt; ""Das Kind sei suizidgefährdet und müsse in die geschlossene Psychiatrie."" 

Translation: ""The kid is in danger of committing suicide and has to be put into the closed part of a psychiatric ward"".

The following paragraph does speak of gender-related therapy, but that are the wishes of the Jugendamt, which obviously has no idea what psychiatrists do. We aren't living in the 1950s anymore...

&gt; ""(...) setzte das Jugendamt die Zwangseinweisung vor dem Amtsgericht durch""

The Jugendamt has won a forced institutionalisation by the local court.""

""Zwangseinweisung"", ""forced institutionalisation"" is a juristic term solely used for suicidal patients, manic-depressive persons and persons with schizoid disorders. There are technically three ways to get one:

1. The so-called ""Fürsorgliche Unterbringung nach dem BGB"", which is a civil-law based method, and which probably does not apply here because one side of the conflict is a public office. This method is designed to protect elderly family members from themselves.
2. The ""Unterbringung nach den Landesgesetzen über die Unterbringung psychisch kranker Personen"", which probably *does* apply here, because the public office, the Jugendamt, has reason to believe that Alex is a danger to him/herself. Theoretically you have to ask a court first, but usually patients are caught first, because of imminent danger (if someone stands on a rooftop, you don't ask a judge first of you may put him into psychiatry). Obviously the Jugendamt tries to play nice by not having done that, mostly because their prime directive is being as little invasive to family structures as possible.
3. The ""Unterbringung im Rahmen eines Strafverfahrens"" for the criminally insane, think Joker. Doesn't apply here.

(Yes, there are some rare cases where they are done for non-cosmetic reasons, but let's not kid ourselves into thinking that's the majority reason.)

But I think the big thing you hit on is this. The main reason trans people transition is to cure depression caused by gender dysphoria. It's not a case of ""might"" be depressed. If they have gender dysphoria that they do not cure, they will suffer from depression, misery, and/or suicidal thoughts, on a **constant** basis for their entire life. The subject of gender dysphoria has been studied for over 80 years, and the above phenomena *has* been documented. Every alternative option of care has been tried. (Anti-depressents, role play sessions, shock therapy, lobotomy, etc.) And the result is a success rate below 5%. Compare this to giving the person hormones &amp; allowing them to transition genders and the success rate becomes 98%. This is why the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association, and the World Health Organization, among others, are all in full support of gender transition as the cure for gender dysphoria.

Your argument that the gender dysphoria is potentially only a temporary condition caused by puberty shows you don't know much about this issue (despite your authoritative tone on the matter), so I'll likely this conversation after this post. Suffice to say, gender dysphoria is a constant aspect of someone's life starting at the age of 2, and never going away until they commit suicide, die, or transition and become cured.

This, for instance, is wrong. Plain and simple.

&gt; Telling someone who is potentially suicidal that they are not allowed to seek an available effective cure simply because YOU don't like the idea...

1. The idea behind suicide watch is preventing suicide, not making the world a happy place. Suicide watch doesn't solve problems, it only gives you enough time to solve them for yourself. E.g. someone who is about to commit suicide because of debt problems doesn't get his debt annulled by suicide watch either.
2. The patient is allowed to seek any cure that is effective once she or he is of age to become an adult. Want to become an airline pilot to not be depressed: Try it. Want to transition into another sex phenotype: Sure, if you want, and if you can afford it (I hear it's rather expensive).
3. Preventing a kid from potentially ruining the rest of its live is despicable? Do you allow your kid to play with explosives?

True. But as I pointed out in the article, at least it gives French artists a stronger platform to launch from.

Send both the compliant letter: your local store management *and* the HQ management and make it clear by writing this into the letter. The HQ needs to see, that the store management is informed, your store management will see that the HQ is involved, too. Your employer *must* help you according to several laws.  
Make it clear that you want discretion about the whole case with no lawyers and Strafanzeige involved, but you expect immediate help within the next 2 weeks (*always set them reasonable deadlines*) because otherwise you would need to go to the lawyer &amp; police and take legal actions.

Excuse me, but the US has less than stellar reviews when it comes to anything but same gender/phenotype heterosexualism. We have open homosexuals as our foreign minister (which kinda is an idiot, but that's on another paper), who was progressive enough to introduce his husband on an official trip to Iran, where homosexuality is punishable by death, and as the major of our capital. Looks that indeed we are a little bit more progressive than the States.

We have a long culture of transsexual people acting as entertainers, not as freaks in a freak show but as stars in revues. While we don't necessarily encourage transsexualism, it's not as if we think of it as being of the devil.

In the case of GID, we simply are more careful, and as long as there is no indication of there being a problem, we don't use drugs. In the most cases, that is the right cause of action (remember, don't fix what isn't broken), and in the few cases where it is not, we can handle the problem later. All studies tell us that the majority of kids showing signs of GID turn out to become homosexual people, but their gender readjusting to their phenotype later on.

1. Que comprenez-vous à la crise actuelle en Europe? 
La crise est liée à un effet domino - les institutions financières comme les pays ne peuvent pas se permettre d'en laisser un partir en banqueroute, car cela les ferait tous tomber les uns après les autres. Tout a commencé quand la Grèçe a reçu un avertissement des agences de notations, signifiant que ses dettes n'avaient pas 100% de chance d'être remboursées... Le marché financier a refusé de lui prêter de l'argent et tout est parti en vrille.... En fait, non, je n'y comprends rien.

2. Avez-vous été témoins des effets de la crise? 
Pas directement. Mais les prix augmentent et les médias tiennent des discours très inquiets (et le gouvernement passe son temps à enlever de l'argent à l'éducation, la recherche, les aides sociales... je suis contre les plans d'austérité :( ).

3. Grâce à la crise, est-il plus difficile de joindre les deux bouts?
""A cause de la crise"" ;) ""grâce à"" sous-entend que c'est positif. Et oui, même si je ne ressens pas directement les effets de la crise, les prix et les loyers augmentent...

4. Vous vous inquiétez pour l’avenir? Non. Bien sûr, il va falloir travailler dur pour avoir un niveau de vie correct, mais je ne pense pas que l'avenir soit complétement catastrophique. 

5. Qui est responsable de la crise et de la récession? Les gouvernements endettés, qui sont à la merci des marchés financiers, et les banques, bien trop avares. 

6. Comment était la position de la société française sur la crise de 2008 et sur la crise actuelle? Je n'en ai aucune idée, désolée :( 

7. Êtes-vous satisfait des actions du gouvernement français? Non, je trouve qu'il n'investit vraiment pas assez dans les sciences et le social. 

8. Est-ce que la Grèce devrait quitter la zone euro? Non, ça ne changerait pas grand chose au problème. 

9. Selon vous, quelles sont les solutions possibles à cette crise? Je n'en vois malheureusement aucune, mais je n'y connais rien en économie :( 

10. A quelle étape sommes-nous de la crise, au début, au milieu, à la fin? Certainement au milieu... Je n'en sais rien :(

How and in what way?  Once she gets off of them and resumes normal puberty, the results will be the same as if she never started to taking them.

Which is why it would be surprising if they decide to force her to not being on anti-androgens.  If a country like the US has that on their standards of care, I would be surprised if Germany didn't.

&gt; In the case of GID, we simply are more careful, and as long as there is no indication of there being a problem, we don't use drugs.

And that, in a great number of cases, can be dangerous to the patient.  I'm glad informed consent is being picked up by more doctors and therapists in the US.  In the case of her actually being trans, waiting it out for her to turn 17-18 would be extremely damaging.

I'm fine with this.  But if she is suffering from GID, therapy won't help.  It wouldn't be a psychological problem, but a physiological problem.  And if there is even a remote possibility of her being trans, they need to take that into account.

&gt; All studies tell us that the majority of kids showing signs of GID turn out to become homosexual people, but their gender readjusting to their phenotype later on.

And because there is a chance it could be GID, the proper course of action is to put her on anti-androgens and wait it out.  Because if she is, and they don't, it could cause way more harm than any anti-androgen could cause.  You seem to be avoiding this point every time.

&gt; So why start to pump hormones into a young kid for the off chance of him or her becoming a real transsexual later?

First of all, things like Spiro are not hormones, they are hormone blockers.  And as to the why?  Because not doing so and her turning out to be trans would cause more problems than the Spiro would cause.

Not to mention that maybe if they actually listen to what they child has to say, they could get a handle on what is best for her.  Most don't give children enough credit.  There is a difference in expressing interest in girl toys and clothes and expressing extreme discomfort in your gender enough to want to kill yourself if puberty progresses.

I don't agree.  You can't play with a person's life like that in the event that she really is trans.  As long as some are hurt by the policy, it's better to delay puberty when the child expresses enough discomfort to want to die because of it.  Especially when going that rout if the person isn't trans just causes puberty delays.  It would be a thousand times more damaging to the child if she is actually trans.  If she isn't, puberty blockers are pretty inconsequential.  You suggest leaving the ones who are trans out in the cold.  It's better to have a policy that minimizes damage on both sides.

Another point where we disagree.

Je doute que le choix de ce mot soit un hasard.

Néanmoins dans le fond son raisonnement me paraît correct, il y a des pratiques et des lois qui sont meilleures que d'autres, il est justifié de l'affirmer haut et fort. Ensuite la gauche tombe effectivement souvent dans une forme de relativisme/faiblesse moral sous couvert de ""respect"" ou d' ""ouverture"".

Pour référence la citation complète de Guéant copiée du Monde.fr
&gt; Il y a des comportements, qui n'ont pas leur place dans notre pays, non pas parce qu'ils sont étrangers, mais parce que nous ne les jugeons pas conformes à notre vision du monde, à celle, en particulier de la dignité de la femme et de l'homme. Contrairement à ce que dit l'idéologie relativiste de gauche, pour nous, toutes les civilisations ne se valent pas. Celles qui défendent l'humanité nous paraissent plus avancées que celles qui la nient. Celles qui défendent la liberté, l'égalité et la fraternité nous paraissent supérieures à celles qui acceptent la tyrannie, la minorité des femmes, la haine sociale ou ethnique. En tout état de cause, nous devons protéger notre civilisation.

Est-ce que ""culture"" au lieu de civilisation aurait été mieux ?

Je serais intéressé par ce que va en dire Hollande. S'il n'est pas bête il laissera passer la polémique et reviendra dessus dans quelques semaines en développant un vrai discours pour montrer qu'il est au-dessus de la mêlée, autant au niveau du rythme que du fond. S'il est bête il fera un communiqué ce soir et se mettra au niveau d'un ministre. 

Je me suis laissé un peu allé dans mon texte alors que je voulais d'abord répondre à Fdurke :) Yallah.

&gt; Il n'est pas question que les civilisations soient supérieures ou inférieures (ce qui est clairement l'état d'esprit de guégué le clown), il est simplement question de préférer une civilisation à une autre à l'aune de ses envies et croyances.

Si on croit vraiment dans ses valeurs, si je crois (parce que je la veux) en l'égalité ou la liberté, est-ce que je n'ai pas envie de les cultiver dans mon pays et de les défendre dans les débats ? Est-ce qu'il n'est pas légitime de critiquer d'autres valeurs ? 

&gt; La phrase de Guéant est typique du culturocentrisme occidental le plus débile. Ce même trait si bourgeois qui a tenté au nom d'idéaux soit-disant universels et soit-disant émancipateurs de façonner le monde avec autant de réussites et de ravages que l'on sait.

Le fait qu'une telle phrase aurait pu être prononcé par un colonialiste il y a 100 ans la disqualifie-t-elle ? Je ne suis pas sûr. 

""tenté de façonner le monde"" ? Non **réussi** (en grande partie) à façonner le monde ces 100 dernières années ! Un peu par le colonialisme, beaucoup par l'hégémonie culturelle, le commerce et quelques guerres...

&gt;Chaque civilisation (chaque croyance) est le fruit de très lentes évolutions et de mouvements qui leur sont propres. Et c'est très bien d'avoir une idée et de la penser meilleure selon ses critères on ne peut moins objectifs. Mais c'est complètement ridicule de prétendre juger les cultures selon nos propres constructions.

Ok alors jugeons sur des indicateurs objectifs : développement humain, santé, réussites scientifiques,  production culturelle, taux d'éducation, violence etc ? Quels seront les résultats ?

&gt; Je terminerai par une phrase de Montesquieu sur les lois positives ""c'est un très grand hasard si celles d'une nation peuvent convenir à une autre"" (in De L'Esprit des lois, chap XXIX, 13)

L'objectif humaniste n'est-il pas universel ? Les lois pour y arriver peuvent bien être différentes certainement.

No.

&gt; This is why, if a child requests it, they should delay puberty.

Children don't have a say in their medical treatments for a reason. They don't know the risks involved. In the specific case medical guardianship is with the Jugendamt, so it's not his/her parents. And the Jugendamt has decided it's in the kids best interest to learn about the other side before trying what seems to be a highly experimental and unusual treatment.

&gt; Which is worse to you? Having children that ask for it sacrifice a few years when they turn out not to be trans or to having children that ask for it sacrifice their entire lives because of GID?

Yes, because once you hit 18, there is no way to turn back. Once you're 18, you will be stuck in your body forever.

And you know the pain of GID because?  40% suicide attempts make that any clearer?  How can losing a few years of development compare to the pain of GID?  

&gt; Children don't have a say in their medical treatments for a reason.

But, their feelings should be seriously taken into account.  Most trans people know that they are trans from the age of around five or six.  To push these kid's feelings aside is marginalizing simply because there are less of them.  Same reason trans people of any age gets marginalized.  There are less of them.

&gt; Yes, because once you hit 18, there is no way to turn back.

This is wrong.  You simply resume your normal puberty.  It's why trans people enter a second puberty over top of their first when they start HRT.  This is a commonly known fact and why the majority of gender therapists recommend taking puberty blockers.  Your stuck in your body forever once you have completed puberty.  Which is why it's so important to catch it before it starts if the person is actually trans.

&gt; It's a little bit like a christmas present. ""But I want it nooowwwww"". Nope, you're going to wait until you're 18.

This shows me how little you know of GID.  It's not a want at all.  It's a strong disconnect between your brain and your body.

The pain of GID is irrelevant when it is compared to impairing a large number of lifes. If you can save one life and have to shoot 100 randomly-choosen people in the knee for that, would you do it?

&gt; How can losing a few years of development compare to the pain of GID?

So now we're comparing psychological anguishes against each other. Why is a GID-related suicide attempt any less desireable than a suicide attempt by a 20-year old who just got into puberty and has a very disturbed relationship life for it?

&gt; But, their feelings should be seriously taken into account.

Yes, if the results are reasonable. The question is what reasonable is. Is it reasonable to impair their lifes if there is a 90% chance of them not actually being trans and a 4% chance (10% of them being trans, 40% of trans kids attempting suicide) of them attempting suicide at one point in their development? And 1% (25% of attempts usually are successful) actually dying from suicide? So for every suicide prevented, I'd have to play god with 100 puberties and developments? Doesn't sound too reasonable to me.

Yes, the 90:10 ratio I pulled out of my behind. I will look up some study to find a reliable number of ""real"" trans kids compared to ""later homosexual"" trans kids.

&gt; You simply resume your normal puberty.

And have lost years. So while your peers have a healthy relationship life, you are stuck in a grown version of a 12 year old child. when they start families, you have developed enough to have your first sexual experiences. When you are ready to settle down, there aren't many potential partners left, so you have to settle for someone less acceptable ... You will have puberty-related anger fits in your job, and eventually your boss will have enough of it and set you free for the labor market. You will be laughed at because hey, got a boob job? At age 19 you were flat as a board, and now you got 38C, ... the problems will last until the day you die.

From my point of view returning to Drachma would be suicidal. The new Drachma wouldn't be worth anything for the next few months or half a year, after that it would probably in time reach 50% of the value of Euro that Nomura has forecast. Thus...

* All prices of imports would increase by 50% including oil and gas. Would the average Greeks afford this?
* How returning to Drachma would make Greece more competitive? How would the export sectors of the economy hire more people? How could the export companies handle transition to the Drachma?

And least but not last, why would return to Drachma be any easier than having an internal devaluation? At the end of the day the fact is that Greeks can't afford their current public sector, either they cut it or all settle for lower standards of living.

* Does anybody in Greece ask this question? Which is better to have, large public sector or higher standard of living? And no, you can't make example of Nordic countries, Nordic economies work because our public sectors are constantly being restructured and reformed to make them more efficient, usually with adding of market based elements and more flexible labor usage.
* Actually what do you think would happen if Greece would return to Drachma, again how could you compete in the global economy?

This public sector is created primarily to attract EU subsidies for politician's friends and families and bribe the local population. It' s run like a mafia organisation. It has to end. But the EU/ IMF are doing nothing to end this (as it will hurt vital business interests that are tied to the Greek public sector). 

 
4. There is no need to compete on everything. Once you stabilise and you can feed, cloth and shelter your population, then you can choose if having iphones is more important then free time. Personally, wealth equals free time. But not everyone shares my views. 

Finally, I think Greece needs to get rid of the Euro, so that it can follow some kind of policy that is not dictated by Germany (i.e. Siemens and Hochtief bribes). I am not really sure it's going to work, it might not, but  what currently is being proposed by Europe is the road to hell.

Not only will the South just not do what the North tells it to, never has, never will but the North lost all legitimacy to dictate when it raised euro interest rates in 2007/2008 to protect it's own interests directly contra the more pressing but less influential interests of the South.

The North allowed the euro to become horribly overvalued for the purposes of the South.   This made the structural reform required far more painful than it should be and in practical terms impossible.

Greece is the first Southern nation to just say no but the others will follow.

Of course this is going to be incredibly painful and many decent people will suffer gravely and it is very sad.

And of course most of the people in the South may not be into the nuance of interest and exchange rate variation but they are plenty wise enough to know a rat when they smell one.

And that is what the North did to the South in 2007 and 2008 and in ratting on the South the North cut the euro's throat.

All for a German inflation rate that peaked at c. 3.5% instead of peaking at c. 6.5%, which is what it did in c. 1973, 1982 and 1991.   

It's all a bit of a shame really.

 In 1997, when US President Barack Obama was just beginning his political career as a state senator in Illinois, Salmond was already using the slogan &amp;quot;Yes, We Can.&amp;quot; The Financial Times sees Salmond as &amp;quot;The canniest politician in the British Isles.&amp;quot; The left-leaning Guardian calls the progressive, pro-European politician &amp;quot;The most naturally gifted political performer in these islands.&amp;quot; And the conservative Times, which has absolutely no soft spot for separatists, perfidiously named him &amp;quot;Briton of the Year&amp;quot; in 2011 - a recognition that surely must have come as a big surprise to Salmond.

 She occasionally meets with him at Balmoral, her summer castle in Scotland, where they talk about horses, Salmond&amp;#039;s second passion.

 Scotland&amp;#039;s most recent move toward separating itself from the rest of Britain began picking up speed three decades ago, when Britain was suffering under its power-conscious ruler, then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

 After Helena Drnovsek Zorko, Slovenia&amp;#039;s ambassador to Japan, signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, she was deluged with emails from Slovenians criticizing her for signing onto the agreement, which encourages widespread network censorship and creates criminal penalties for copyright infringement.

 The ambassador read the agreement more closely and decided she agreed with the critics, and wrote an open letter of apology to her country for signing them up to the treaty.

 Quite simply, I did not clearly connect the agreement I had been instructed to sign with the agreement that, according to my own civic conviction, limits and withholds the freedom of engagement on the largest and most significant network in human history, and thus limits particularly the future of our children.

 Following protests against the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect IP Act in the United States last month, groups in Europe have set Feb. 11 as a day of protest against another controversial measure.

 The protests focus on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trademark Agreement in Europe, according to a report on tech site The Next Web.

 January&amp;#039;s protests prompted US lawmakers to shelve further progress on the controversial measures for the moment.

 Ukraine&amp;#039;s Ministry of Emergencies reported that at least 131 people had died during a cold snap that has lasted more than a week in which night temperatures have dropped well below freezing.

 In Poland, the PAP news agency reported that Prime Minister Donald Tusk had asked local authorities to waive the ban on admitting inebriated people to homeless shelters after eight more people died, bringing the death toll from the storm to 53 in Poland.

 The extreme cold also caused the death of at least three people in Hungary, the country&amp;#039;s national news agency, MTI, said, and at least five people froze to death in Lithuania over the weekend.

 Almost 70,000 people remained cut off in snowed-in Serbian villages, with police and military units providing basic necessities, said Predrag Maric, the police official in charge of Serbia&amp;#039;s emergency services.

 The conventional explanation for the superiority of democracy to the alternatives is that democracies hold regular elections.

 Democracies can put democracy on hold and get away with it; if autocrats suspend their autocratic powers, they tend not to get them back.

 Democracies have to hold elections not because they are democracies, but because sometimes, by necessity, they aren&amp;#039;t.
