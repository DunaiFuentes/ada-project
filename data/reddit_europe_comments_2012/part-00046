""Was er in Peking mache, will Reich-Ranicki von Menuhin wissen. Dieser antwortet knapp: „Beethoven und Brahms mit dem hiesigen Orchester.“  Und was tue ein Literaturkritiker in Peking, fragt Menuhin zurück. „Ich halte hier Vorträge über Goethe und Thomas Mann“, antwortet Reich-Ranicki. Daraufhin schweigt Menuhin einige Augenblicke — und sagt dann: „Nun ja, wir sind eben Juden.“  Nach einer weiteren kurzen Pause: „Dass wir von Land zu Land reisen, um deutsche Musik und deutsche Literatur zu interpretieren — das ist gut und richtig so.“  Die beiden Männer sehen sich an: nachdenklich, schweigend, vielleicht auch ein wenig melancholisch.""

(my own imperfect translation: ""What he is doing in Peking, Reich-Ranicki wants to know from Menhuin. He answers briefly: ""Beethoven and Brahms with the local orchestra,"" And what does a literature critic do in Peking, asks Menuhin. ""I'm holding lectures about Goethe and Thomas Mann"" answers Reich-Ranicki. Thereupon Menuhin keeps silent for some time - to finally say: ""Well, we are Jews after all."" [*the 'eben' is hard to translate*] After another short pause: ""That we are traveling from country to country, to interpret German music and German literature - that is good and that is right.""

For instance, in all of those countries, pension funds are all depleted. People who work today have to fund the retirement money for those who have worked 40 years ago. They're not investing in their own retirement money. 

For politicians, it's easy to make money by privatization. Otherwise they would have to cut e.g. social programs and healthcare. That would anger the people, for good reasons. So politicians keep themselves afloat.

La création d'écoles coraniques sous contrat (elles existent déjà hors-contrat) serait un non-sens. T'as déjà été dans une école ""catholique"" sous contrat? Ca n'a de catholique que le nom. Toutes les confessions y sont acceptées et l'enseignement y est le même que dans les écoles publiques. Maintenant, tu regardes les écoles coraniques, financées et fournies en matos pédagogique par l'Arabie Saoudite, qui n'acceptent que des élèves musulmans, etc. Tu ne peux pas justifier du financement public pour ces écoles.

Le concordat date d'avant 1905, donc il n'est pas question de le remettre en question.

Et puis ""laïcité"" n'est pas synonyme d' ""anti-tradition"", on est un pays historiquement et traditionnellement catholique (la France, fille aînée de l'Eglise), et tu ne peux pas jeter cette relation fondamentale à la poubelle sous couvert de ""laïcité"". L'Eglise n'a aucun pouvoir public en France, le catholicisme n'est pas religion d'Etat, le pays est donc laïc.

L'immigration légale n'est pas difficile à limiter, ils le font très bien dans d'autres pays (le Canada par exemple) donc faudra m'expliquer la ""difficulté"". 

Pareil, partout dans le monde un étranger qui vient étudier repart chez lui avec son savoir après que son permis d'étude ait expiré (je sais, je l'ai fait). Le fait d'être venu étudier ne te donne pas un droit obligatoire de rester. Et pour ce qui est des ""travailleur qualifiés"", on ferait mieux de réformer le système en France pour produire plus de travailleurs qualifiés. On ne peut plus se permettre, avec le taux de chômage actuel, de continuer à faire venir des travailleurs étrangers, aussi qualifiés soient-ils. 

Et la France n'est pas un ""pays vieillissant"", le Japon est un ""pays vieillissant"", on a encore le temps de voir venir en France. Et c'est pas une excuse pour ""remplacer"" les vieux Blancs par des jeunes extra-européens. C'est du nettoyage ethnique. (Et, une fois de plus, le taux de chômage me dit qu'on est largement assez en France).

Pour ce qui est de l'immigration illégale, c'est peut être coûteux mais c'est quoi ta solution? On régularise tout le monde? Merci bien.

Non une vraie solution serait de pénaliser lourdement les boîtes qui les emploient. De surveiller la Méditerranée (c'est faisable, ils le font pour les trafiquants de drogue) et surtout d'avoir un système où les étudiants extra-européens formés en France soient encouragés à retourner chez eux faire profiter de leur savoir faire.

Don't think I'm just an optimistic, I'm not, it's just that there are so many in a much worse situation than us and it was this system which allowed us to be where we are for so long - at peace, with food on our tables, leading the world in terms of life expectancy or scientific development, yada yada yada - while others, with different methods, are still having such difficulties. I mean, look into other systems where there's not a financial sector, are they better off than us or are they much worse?

As for those clauses having no meaning, read the article carefully: 
*""One clause was for a renegotiation of loan terms in the event of a currency change, either if Greece left the euro or the euro area broke up, while the other ensured English law would prevail in the event of non-payment""*
This means that in case of non-payment you will have to abide to the much harder English Laws that are in favor of those who lent instead of those who get loans. Also if your loans are in another law system instead of that of your country, you lose the right to simply decide to erase them, only the English courts will have that right. Legally you are in a very bad situation. They will even have the right to confiscate country assets in order to get paid back. Take a look at this article: [English law set to rule new Greek bonds](http://www.athensnews.gr/issue/13478/52264) to get an idea, since it's already happening in Greece. This will happen to your country too. 

Of course you can still ignore that, but I believe you can realize that the implications for such an action will be far more worse since you won't be able to take shelter to the International Law systems.

Im not much of a advocate of the gold standard. Its useful to provide a currency with stability if need be, but a fiat currency can be a better option as long as the central bank is reponsible. I do strongly support competing currencies though.

&gt; Yes, increased inflation - incapacity of attracting investment, much more difficulties in investing in foreign countries, power supplies threatened by the increased cost of oil, food much more expensive, impossibility to ask for more loans as nobody wants to be paid in worthless paper, yada yada yada. In fact, why don't we just ditch all forms of currency? It'd saves us the trouble of printing and minting and we'd go straight into the wonders of inflation!

I assume you believe it's a better option to surrender our finances to the EU and remain in a monetary union that is doomed to fail?

Going back to the escudo would force us to live within our means and to export more. It is much more likely that we would just adapt to it rather than collapse and find ourselves without the ability to import oil or other necessities, you're just being overly dramatic. Besides the BoP would know very well that the escudo would be competing against the euro so they would be very dedicated in protecting the credibility of the currency and preventing inflation from getting out of hand.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The capitalist pigs :) at FT.com have a paywall, so here the article (bold is mine):


Are the markets panicking because Spain may fail to hit its deficit targets, or are they panicking at the thought that Spain may succeed? That, to me at least, is the key question facing eurozone policy makers. The ultimate outcome of the eurozone crisis will depend to a large extent on how that question is answered.
 

News coverage seems to suggest that the markets are panicking about the deficits themselves. I think this is wrong. The investors I know are worried that austerity may destroy the Spanish economy, and that it will drive Spain either out of the euro or into the arms of the European Stability Mechanism. 


**The orthodox view, held in Berlin, Brussels and in most national capitals (including, unfortunately, Madrid), is that you can never have too much austerity. Credibility is what matters. When you miss the target, you must overcompensate to hit it next time. The target is the goal – the only goal.**


**This view does not square with the experience of the eurozone crisis, notably in Greece. It does not square with what we know from economic theory, or from economic history. And it does not square with the simple though unscientific observation that the periodic episodes of market panic about Spain have always tended to follow an austerity announcement.** One such episode came with the discussion that led to the recently introduced draft budget, which included a deficit correction of 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product for 2012. When Mariano Rajoy, Spain’s prime minister, began to outline the deficit cuts for 2013 last week, the markets panicked again and drove Spanish 10-year yields back to 6 per cent. The targeted fiscal adjustment amounts to 5.5 per cent of GDP over a period of two years. It is one of the biggest fiscal adjustments ever attempted by a large industrial country. It is perfectly rational for investors to be scared.
 

European policy makers have a tendency to treat fiscal policy as a simple accounting exercise, omitting any dynamic effects. The Spanish economist Luis Garicano made a calculation, as reported in El País, in which the reduction in the deficit from 8.5 per cent of GDP to 5.3 per cent would require not a €32bn deficit reduction programme (which is what a correction of 3.2 per cent would nominally imply for a country with a GDP of roughly €1tn), but one of between €53bn and €64bn. So to achieve a fiscal correction of 3.2 per cent, you must plan for one almost twice as large. 


**Spain’s effort at deficit reduction is not just bad economics, it is physically impossible, so something else will have to give. Either Spain will miss the target, or the Spanish government will have to fire so many nurses and teachers that the result will be a political insurrection.**


**The wider eurozone crisis was caused by financial flows from banks in the core countries, which financed bubbles in the periphery, except in Greece. Spain may also have a dysfunctional labour market and fixing it may still be highly desirable. If this is a good moment to do it politically, then so be it. But we should not fall for the illusion that structural reforms are going to make a big difference. Austerity and reform are not the magic combination policy makers believe them to be.**


Fixing the Spanish crisis will have to start with the banks – and this is a task the private sector is not willing, and the government not able, to perform. The only halfway benign solution I can see would involve a European rescue programme for Spain that focuses specifically on the recapitalisation and downsizing of the financial sector. Spain would also need to undershoot the eurozone’s average inflation rate over many years to redress some of the lost price competitiveness. At the same time, the country needs to go easy on austerity. 


That combination of policies might just work, though it would still be difficult. What is not going to work is a combination of deflation, austerity and private sector deleveraging, all at the same time, for a decade.


But it will be tried – of that there can be little doubt. The EU will resist an ESM programme for as long as possible. The eurozone finance ministers fear that any such programme might reopen the debate about the size of the ESM, a debate they want to avoid at all costs. But as the recession gets worse, and Spanish unemployment rises towards 30 per cent, the pressure for Spain to turn to the ESM will grow. It will happen eventually. And even when that happens, it will not end the crisis in Spain. For that a eurozone-wide bank resolution system would also be necessary. 


I can see only two outcomes for Spain. The crisis will end either in a catastrophic Spanish withdrawal from the eurozone, or in a variant of a fiscal union that includes a joint eurozone backstop to the financial sector. If the Spanish government pursues the strategy it has announced to the bitter end, the first outcome will become vastly more probable.",0,1335060888,null,0,true,0,c4f38xt,t3_sm3ev,t1_c4f38xt,t3_sm3ev,null,1428770290,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

As for the flight, don't even waste your time thinking about it. You'll be slightly uncomfortable for a few hours but that's all first wold problems stuff. Don't be daft, get at least a few hours of sleep. Flying west to east, you'll loose a night. If you spend the whole flight watching *Happy Feet 2* or playing *Angry Birds*, you'll arrive in Germany early in the morning without having slept. Guaranteed jetlag.

I find the cost of living in Germany to be cheaper than the US. However, it depends on where you live in the US. If you're from a rural area, odds are things will be more expensive. You should also know the exchange rate has historically been 1.00 USD = 0,70* Euros (note that Germans us a comma where you would expect to see a period.) That does not mean that things are 30% more expensive but rather that when you see a 5,00€ Döner, that loosely equates into a $6.50 meal. (You must try a Döner while in Germany, it's great street food.)

I'm not sure how your exchange will work but you should figure out how to get money while in Germany. While most US debit cards work for taking money out, you'll get hit with currency exchange fees and ATM fees. Try to avoid that by pre-ordering euros, exchanging dollars at a bank, or getting a credit card that doesn't charge currency exchange fees. Also know that cash is king and credit cards are not widely accepted.

There will be countless cultural differences but know that is where half the fun begins. Seeing how you get here in the peek of summer, I'm guessing the first thing you'll notice is that Germans don't rely on air conditioning or even fans to keep cool. In fact, most men will ware pants throughout the summer and picking out American tourists in shorts and t-shirts is a national pastime. 

Above all else, I recommend to be easy going and try doing things their way. Relative to the rest of the world, Germany is very similar to the US (especially WI). If you keep an open mind and make an effort join the locals, you'll have a lot of fun (and possibly learn some stuff along the way).

I'm from the US (CO/IL/MN) but have lived in Germany off and on since I was 13. I feel more at home in Germany now than I do back state-side.

true,arnoooooo,null,null,"&gt; Quels débordements des catholiques

Un exemple, en plus lié au FN : http://www.agoravox.tv/tribune-libre/article/a-l-extreme-droite-du-pere-26134

&gt; Le concordat date d'avant 1905, donc il n'est pas question de le remettre en question.

Ah bon, tout ce qui est ancien, pas question d'y toucher ? Je ne vois pas pourquoi dans un pays qui se dit laïque on devrait financer l'église catholique et uniquement elle. La tradition ne peut pas justifier des comportements politiques ou des lois. Sinon, on avance jamais. Par tradition, les noirs étaient des esclaves et les femmes n'avaient pas le droit de vote.

Qui plus est, sponsoriser l'église catholique, c'est sponsoriser un activisme extrêmement destructif, en particulier en Afrique. Militer contre le préservatif, c'est encourager des naissances dans des familles qui ne peuvent ni nourrir ni soigner un enfant de plus. C'est aussi encourager l'épidémie de Sida. L'action anti homosexualité des catholiques est une autre horreur absolue, avec des pays qui décident d'adopter la peine de mort ou de faire des purges sous l'influence des missionnaires du Vatican.

Du coté de la France, le fait que l'IVG ne soit pas encore quelque chose de complètement acquis, ou que le mariage homosexuel soit en débat est majoritairement du à l'influence catholique. Je suppose que dans les deux cas tu n'est pas favorable. Pour moi, on aura la dessus dans 30 ans (ou plus tôt, je l’espere) le même regard qu'on a aujourd'hui sur l'esclavage. Mais c'est un autre débat, qu'on pourra avoir séparément si tu veux.

&gt; L'immigration légale n'est pas difficile à limiter,

Si, et je t'ai dit pourquoi. Tu ne va pas dire aux gens qu'ils ne peuvent pas se marier avec qui ils veulent ? C'est la moitié de l'immigration. Et pour les étudiants, effectivement il repartent pour la plupart, ce n'est pas pour ça qu'ils ne sont pas comptés comme immigrants l'année de leur arrivée (en tous cas par le FN qui aime grossir les chiffres). Et former des travailleurs hyper-qualifiés en France, plutôt que de les faire venir, c'est évidemment un bon objectif. Pour ça, il faut des formateurs hyper-qualifiés, et on ne va pas les inventer. On les fait venir. D’où le nombre important d'immigrants de ce type dans le secteur universitaire, encore une fois souvent temporaires. Et les demandeurs d'asile venant de pays aux régimes horribles ou il sont par exemple condamnés à mort, on les refuse ? On a pas le droit du fait de la convention de Genève. Les immigrants d'autres types, il n'en reste pas beaucoup (voire pas du tout ?).

&gt; Et la France n'est pas un ""pays vieillissant"", le Japon est un ""pays vieillissant"", on a encore le temps de voir venir en France. 

C'est toi qui le dis. Je suis prêt à parier que si on avait fait un débat sur le régime des retraites, tu m'aurais dit que la population française était vieillissante.

&gt; Et c'est pas une excuse pour ""remplacer"" les vieux Blancs par des jeunes extra-européens. C'est du nettoyage ethnique.

Je crois que le point Godwin n'est pas loin :) D'abord, on est a des kilomètres d'une immigration qui dépasserait la natalité en France, donc tu peux être rassuré sur le fait que la France restera bien blanche pour encore un bon moment. C'est horrible ce que tu racontes. On s'en fout complètement de savoir qui est noir ou blanc ou marron ou jaune, européen ou pas. La génétique a plus que prouvé que ces considérations n'avaient aucun sens. Et si l'humanité a survécu jusqu'à maintenant, c'est avant tout parce qu'elle a plus ou moins su se rendre compte que la solidarité est la seule façon de s'en sortir.

Le discours FN (et souvent UMP) est extrêmement polarisateur : les musulmans et les non musulmans, les Français et les non Français, les blancs et les non blancs (pas en public celui-la)... bref tout ce qui peut faire un ""nous"" et un ""eux"". C'est égoïste, c'est dangereux, et ça n'a pas de sens.

Il y a largement assez pour qu'on s'en sorte tous très bien. Inutile de monter les uns contre les autres en utilisant tout ce qui peut faire une différence, qu'elle ait du sens ou non.

&gt; (Et, une fois de plus, le taux de chômage me dit qu'on est largement assez en France).

Encore une fois, une économie ne fonctionne pas comme ça. Ce n'est pas plus de gens = plus de chômage. Car ces nouveaux gens peuvent inspirer, innover et représentent de la demande. La France est plus riche (en terme de PIB) qu'elle ne l'a jamais été. Pourtant, il y a des millions de pauvres et de chômeurs. Pourquoi ? Parce que certains s'en mettent plein les poches. Et ce ne sont pas les immigrés. Ne mélangeons pas tout.

&gt; Pour ce qui est de l'immigration illégale, c'est peut être coûteux mais c'est quoi ta solution? On régularise tout le monde? Merci bien.

C'est en effet une solution. Au minimum, appliquer le droit du travail pareil à tout le monde. Et ta comparaison avec le trafic de drogue est révélatrice Tu as une idée du coût financier et humain de la guerre contre les drogues ? Et de son effet ? C'est sur, on a jamais vu de drogue en France depuis que c'est interdit. Et encore moins de la drogue qui ait traversé la Méditerranée !

Enfin, tu parles du mythe de l'Europe comme Eldorado. Par rapport à bien d'autres pays, c'est une vérité.

- flight:
 
Take chewing gum or something on the flight for take off and landing, take your own headphones on the plane if you want to listen to on board entertainment, don't worry about security checks, just do as they say and be friendly and you'll be fine. If you happen to have something along you are not aloud to have on the plane, don't make a big deal about it, apologize and throw it away.

- jetlag: 

go to bed at a normal time and try to sleep as long as possible even if you are not tired. Don't sleep during the day if at all possible. This will help you adjust to the time difference as quickly as possible.

- Germans: 

This might sound strange, but it's something you really need to know. Very often Germans tend NOT to avoid subjects that you do not agree on. You might even get into a heated discussion... Afterwards you will probably feel like they hate you. But the exact opposite will be the case. Your conversational partner might have really enjoyed your little argument and thought of it maybe even as small talk...
e.g. You might get asked: ""Why do so many people oppose Obama's health plan""... They will most likely be absolutely for it because of the way the health system works in Germany and will vehemently argue for it (maybe even calling anyone who does oppose it stupid...). You might see it as an attack, but it isn't!!!

- Do's and Don'ts:



- Do not ask something like ""Why don't you do it like us (in the US)?"" (In other words avoid comparing everything out loud...)
Often things are done differently. That doesn't always mean that it is better or worse that way, only different... 

- Don't: Get completely shitfaced at parties. Since the legal drinking age is 16 (for beer and wine) Germans tend not to binge drink as much. (there are always exceptions...)

- Don't: Complain out loud in English in public... 99% of all Germans speak or understand English and you will make a complete fool out of yourself ;)

- Do: Eat German food. Food and eating together as a family is often very important in Germany.

- Do: Look at how things are done differently in your surroundings from what you are used to. Try doing it that way as well. Have fun trying out new things. (e.g. Germans have other rules for what is polite at the table...)

- Do: Take it easy!! Have fun!! Try out new things!!! Celebrate the differences!!

In addition Hollande appears much less effective than Sarkozy, and even if he had a good cause, which he does not, then he'd be less likely to be effective than Sarkozy. Reducing retirement age back to 60 is just populism, a 75% tax rate for the top earners are not going to bring in much money as it will lead to many of those leaving, and may end up reducing tax income. If Hollande persist in such counter productive initiatives he will lead France towards less prosperity, and less influence in Europe.

Most German schools don't offer the amount of afternoon activities that American high schools do. They might have the occasional theater/music class or a sport, but on most days your school day will be over by early afternoon. That means that school isn't even remotely as important for the social life as it is in the US. Some students even treat school as a form of work and will take pride in *not* having anything to do with their classmates outside of school. I know from my own experience that being an exchange student can make you feel a bit lost and lonely, especially if you don't immediately hit it off with you guest family. 

My suggestion: Once you know where exactly you'll be going, do some research and find something that interests you. In Germany most activities -especially sports - are organized in independent associations called ""Verein"". They are literally everywhere (people say three Germans getting together will found a Verein), cover pretty much anything and are mostly very inexpensive. They are also a great way to get to know people and practice your language in an out-of-school environment.

Pour ce qui est du Concordat, c'est pas parce que c'est ancien, c'est parce que ça ne tombe pas sous le coup de la loi (car la région n'était pas française). Donc à moins de changer la loi (ce que personne ne propose d'ailleurs). C'est pas la peine de faire des sophismes et des parallèles douteux avec l'esclavage.

Après je suis d'accord que certaines politiques de l'Eglise Catholique en Afrique sont mal-pensées. Notamment celles sur la contraception. Par contre c'est malhonnête de dire qu'il existe des politiques catholiques ouvertement anti-homosexuels, si tu te renseigne bien tu verras que c'est presque exclusivement l'influence des églises évangéliques nord-américaines qui influencent et mènent au politiques étatiques violentes (cf. Ouganda).

Le mariage homosexuel en France est un non-débat du fait de l'existence du Pacs et de la quasi-relégation du mariage à une cérémonie uniquement religieuse (et, aux dernières nouvelles les églises font ce qu'elles veulent). Et d'ailleurs, quand bien même des homosexuels seraient mariés au civil, je m'en contrefoutrais (donc tu vois, c'est vilain de faire des suppositions :) ) Et enfin, sur cette question, permet moi de relever que tu ne parles pas de la position de l'islam sur les homosexuels.

Qui plus est, l'Etat ne ""sponsorise"" pas l'Eglise catholique, c'est quoi ces bêtises?

""Régimes horribles"", selon quels critères? Et la convention de Genève ne nous oblige en aucun cas à prendre ""tous les condamnés à mort"", elle ne s'applique que pour les ressortissants persécutés selon des critères de religion/ethnie/idées politiques, sinon n'importe quel meurtrier de droit commun pourrait revendiquer le droit d'asile.

Après pour ce qui est de formateurs hyper-qualifiés, je vois pas pourquoi on n'en aurait pas en France (c'est quoi cette dépréciation permanente?) mais en tout cas là n'est pas le problème, ils représentent de toute façon une partie infime de l'immigration.

Je maintiens que la population française est relativement peu vieillissante. Je vois pas ce que les retraites viennent faire là dedans.

Je ne vois pas en quoi c'est ""horrible"" ce que je raconte. Ton discours internationaliste de base, dénaturant les peuples, est tout aussi ""horrible"" à mes yeux. Et je rajouterais que définir un ""nous"" est un ""eux"" c'est sain, naturel et vital pour un peuple. Ce n'est pas une marque de ""haine"" ou de rejet, c'est une simple définition d'identité.

Non c'est peut être pas plus de gens = plus de chômage, mais c'est certainement pas plus de gens = moins de chômage. Tu peux pas honnêtement faire venir plus de travailleurs dans un pays où il n'y a déjà pas assez de travail, c'est insensé. Et oui évidement qu'il y a des gens qui s'en mettent plein les poches, c'est les mêmes qui se font des couilles en or sur le dos des clandestins d'ailleurs, et c'est eux les vrais criminels.

Et non aujourd'hui l'Europe est loin d'être un El Dorado. Je suis tout à fait d'accord avec toi qu'il faut aider les autres pays, comme je disais c'est un cercle vicieux qui, au final, ne bénéficie qu'à très peu de gens. 
Mais c'est pas en continuant de promettre un bonheur inexistant à la force de travail et aux cerveaux de ces pays que la situation va s'améliorer. C'est en faisant un vrai travail de re-dynamisation et en renversant les flux Sud-Nord qu'on pourra espérer faire en sorte que ces pays puissent se développer sainement tout en préservant souveraineté et identité (en se faisant pas racheter par les Chinois et les Indiens par exemple).

You probably already have invested a good deal of the productivity gains towards less work. Not just the 35-hour workweek, and a relative early retirement age, but as much a high unemployment rate. And perhaps the productivity gains have not matched international or even European gains. But in general many European nations are in this conundrum that a dwindling part of the population is working more and more, whereas an increasing part of the population is not working at all. So the overall benefit of increased productivity is not immediately evident to those that works and they can with some reason demand less work, whereas overall the people of the nation are working less.

&gt; Wages aren't set by productivity, but by the lowest possible amount that is competitive. This is clear, otherwise sweatshop workers would be millionaires.

What is competitive is a product of labour production. A worker that is twice as productive as another worker will be able to stay competitive at twice the salary. Assuming no change to productivity, a worker that works 20% less than another worker will become 20% less competitive and must accept 20% pay cut.

On the long run, tax increases just aren't viable, they create deadweight losses and hurt the economy as a whole. If well planed, they can work just fine, but they never work in as planned the short term and with the only intention of allowing governments to continue to spend more than what they can, they just delay the problems.

Regarding nationalizations, it's impossible and in direct conflict with the free market and with the rights of the investors, and quite rightly so, I'm sure you'd be pretty pissed as well if you built a company from the ground up and suddenly the government came and took it all away because they want to keep spending like there's no tomorrow. Not to mention that if you compare private-owned companies with state-owned ones, the private ones are constantly more profitable than the state ones, just because they have a much better incentive not to waste money. If they are vital to society, you can just regulate them so they don't harm society and tax them instead of nationalize them and let the tax payers work to maintain it.

&gt;The wealth hasn't just disappeared, the factories and fields are just as productive as before.

Not comparatively, Asian countries for instance are able to sell the same products some of us manufacture much more cheaply, that obviously hurts our industry. It's not that we're doomed to decline, it's just that we need to adapt and compete on other products, in those in which we have comparative advantages (for example, instead of mass manufacture of clothing, research and development of technology in medicine). While we continue to compete with them while being in such a serious disadvantage, we'll obviously just struggle and fail to accomplish much, its also why some countries in the EU are much less affected than others, because of what they were focused on producing.",0,1335092896,null,0,false,0,c4f6zks,t3_sli5z,t1_c4f6zks,t1_c4f6wfg,null,1428772042,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Quant à toi, je n'ai jamais dit que tu l'étais, lié au FN.

&gt;  Any news on you making a blog yet? :)

\*cough\* It's in what I like to call the ""incubation phase"". Which is a euphemism that means I'm thinking about it occasionally... :)

&gt; the US very often releases higher than forecasted numbers and then revises them the next month

Yes, the Economist even had a whole article [about that](http://www.economist.com/node/18618589).

The US have enormous issues coming their way with financing Medicare and Social Security for the beginning wave of retiring Baby Boomers. I also can't see how such a huge trade deficit could be sustainable if (when?) the US dollar loses it's dominant reserve status and the inflow of capital dries up. But that's relatively long term, entirely predictable and they've still got some time left to address this.  
What you write about a possible increase of interest rates it's something I've been thinking about as well -- they're unnaturally low right now, due to the Fed's bond buying programs and the US' safe haven status during the crisis. Once interest rates increase, this will become a problem that they'll have to deal with, somehow, but I don't think it will happen before we've got the situation over here firmly under control. And when it does, it will still take years until all of the bonds will have been replaced and the higher rates take full effect. As it is, we're having much more imminent problems than they have.

The big difference to the hard hit European countries is that the US has a relatively well functioning bureaucracy and a highly dynamic economy that can reallocate resources extremely quickly -- the Spanish engineers that Germany needs can't speak German. US spending is unsustainable in the long term without ever more excessive help by the Fed, but only at current spending and revenue levels. They have a lot of potential to cut military spending, and by European standards their tax levels are ridiculously low. They could, in principle, solve any potential solvency problem over night by simply agreeing on higher taxes. Politically, this would be somewhat inconvenient, but before they'd stop paying bond holders the millions of retirees, welfare recipients and public servants would find their monthly checks arriving seriously cut, if they arrived at all. Investors seem to have faith that Congress would prove to be surprisingly pragmatic in tax questions if it ever got that far. 

&gt; I understand that this may be too 'conspiracy theory' for some people, but you need to remember that Spain, for example, doesn't have a debt problem, it has a growth/unemployment problem.

Yes and no. They still have relatively low debt, compared to, say, Italy (or any other major European economy, for that matter), but other than Italy what they lack is a credible path out of the growth/unemployment problem that you've mentioned. Their construction sector will never recover to even remotely the level where it had been, and I can't really see anything with which they could replace it with in the foreseeable future.

And that's the difference. Spain can't credibly answer how they plan to sell new ten year bonds to replace the ones that they sell today when they mature. The US, on the other hand, can draw up plans that seem at least somewhat realistic. They could solve it through higher tax levels, or they could grow out of the problem. Venture capital is much easier to get in the US, which is why they have all those large Internet companies. Any well educated professional speaks English well enough to start over in the US if the money is good enough to make up for what we perceive as certain cultural shortcomings; legal immigration alone results in 1% population growth every three years, and they have more children than Europeans do. More people at equal total debt means less debt per capita. If all else fails, the Fed will pick up the tab -- not exactly a perfect solution, but it would still mean that bond holders would get most of their investment back.

Don't get me wrong, the US definitely has problems that they need to address, and the aforementioned ""political inconvenience"" carries a certain risk due to the way politics works in the US. This is already beginning to make the Chinese nervous. That the euro, despite the very severe risks, is still about where it was before the subprime mortgage crisis relative to the dollar speaks volumes (a while ago a nice article referred to it as a ""reverse beauty contest where the least ugly currency wins""). But thanks to their unique willingness to accept social inequality as either god's will or laziness on the part of the affected, and lack of alternatives for the capital to go to instead, I don't think they'll run into problems that are comparable to e.g., Spain's before we sort our problems out over here in Europe. *If* we manage to come up with a good and stable solution here, though, like a proper financial union, and thereby remove the doubt about the euro's long-term viability that had been holding it back as a reserve currency from day one, well, that would be good for us.",0,1335100124,null,0,false,0,c4f7int,t3_sjz3l,t1_c4f7int,t1_c4en6gq,null,1428772362,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

So why do they do that, when it's financially bad for the artists?
Because they don't care for ALL artists. From the 64,000 artists in the GEMA only 3300 are entitled a vote. They are voting, for example, on the key how profits are shared. 
It's quite complicated and infamously divides music into lower quality ""Entertainment Music"" and higher qulity ""Serious Music"".

true,smacksaw,CANA,Canada,"&gt;On top of all these concerns, one must also ask what 30-day border controls are supposed to accomplish. No one can seriously believe they will change migration within the Schengen zone in any meaningful way.

On one hand, no. Borders are porous and people don't have to take roads to cross them. They could easily circumvent them. 

On the other hand, this isn't just political theatre. The first step to rooting out this problem is by visibly patrolling for it. The next step is returning these people to Italy or Greece. 

The real failure is the unfair burden this places on Spain, Italy and Greece. You can't allow people to circumvent lawful immigration when others wait fairly and legally. If France and Germany don't like it, they should be performing interdictions and Italy and Greece especially should be asking for and accepting their help. 

If the EU fancies itself a nation, well...it needs to behave like one and protect the sovereignty and security of itself as a whole, and it's member states. Everyone needs to participate in enforcing immigration laws. You can't pass the buck.

true,vtjohnhurt,UNSA,United States,"&gt;it still wouldn't be as competitive as the *same* products made in Asia.

Correct.  The Greeks would not be making iphones, they would be making extremely cheap winter vacations for Northern Europeans (and Americans),  very cheap olive oil, figs, wine and other traditional greek products.  They probably would also get some new manufacturing jobs just as Mexico gets factory jobs from the USA because of their low wages.

&gt;The price of their imports, however, would increase significantly

That is part of the cure.  Once they are back on the Drachma, no one in Greece would be able to afford an iphone or a BMW.  No one could afford imported food so they would have to start raising more food internally.  

&gt;the protectionism has proven not to work

No one said anything about protectionism.  A floating exchange rate is not protectionism.  Protectionism occurs when import tariffs are imposed or exports are subsidized by the government.

&gt;The inflation would be awful 

There would be some inflation of the drachma and this would be another way to lower wages fairly for everyone at the same time.  If the government mismanaged monetary policy, then there would be hyper-inflation but that would be a policy action by the government and not an automatic result.

&gt;Lowering wages in Greece is actually kind of painless 

The problem with trying to lower wages (still denominated in Euros) is that it cannot happen fast enough, nor deep enough, nor fairly to everyone at the same time and to the same extent.

Les estimations des instituts sont réalisées à partir du dépouillement des 100 premiers bulletins dans des bureaux de vote test où le scrutin s'est clos à 18H00. Le scrutin, qui consacre un affrontement droite-gauche classique, a connu, avec environ 80%, le deuxième taux de participation le plus élevé pour un premier tour depuis l'élection au suffrage universel d'un président de la Ve République, tout juste devancé par celui de 2007.

Edit : lu sur letemps.ch (journal suisse, en premiére page) :
Il faut savoir que les principaux instituts de sondage français mettent à disposition de leurs mandataires des estimations basées sur le dépouillement des premiers bureaux tests. Lors des précédentes élections, ces estimations étaient largement portées, au-delà des mandataires directs, à la connaissance des médias étrangers à l’Hexagone. Elles étaient sourcées et livrées de bonne grâce.

Aujourd’hui, cette situation a considérablement changé: les neuf principaux instituts de sondage français qui recueillent et élaborent pareilles estimations ont promis de ne pas communiquer ces résultats aux médias étrangers qui ne respecteraient pas l’embargo de 20h00. Dès lors ces sondages ne sont plus accessibles que de seconde main et ne peuvent être publiés qu’au mépris des engagements pris par les instituts.

Au vu de cette situation nouvelle, née de l’exacerbation de la polémique liée à une publication anticipée, Le Temps, après réflexion et pesée précise des intérêts, a décidé de ne publier ces estimations que dès 20h01, dans le respect des embargos décidés.",0,1335116507,null,0,true,0,c4f9uni,t3_smn9m,t1_c4f9uni,t1_c4f9r7q,null,1428773461,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

But I understand what you are saying. That does sound sad.

During this crisis a disconnect has emerged between base rates and what retail banks will lend at so mortgage rates in the US are at a low 3.75% fixed over 30 years, which is a pretty good deal.

But obviously not as good as the 0.25% base rate.

Then there is the rate of interest central banks have to pay the institutions they sell their bonds to - to prevail upon these institutions to buy those bonds.

This can vary a lot.

It spiked a while ago at over 7% for Italy, before falling back to less than 5%, thanks to Mr Draghi printing €500,000,000,000.00.

But these interest rates have been climbing again as this €500 billion euros seems to be just a flash in the pan.

So that is the relevant interest rate in this context.

And will the banks lend to Hollande at something affordable like 3.5% for him to raise wages and cut the retirement age, when France can't afford what it's got already and Hollande wants to tax senior bankers 75% of the highest proportion of their remuneration, on top of swingeing social charges and MrHollande has declared finance his no.1 enemy ..... ?

I dunno.   You decide. 

But bear in mind that French national debt is probably more than 85% of French GPD and that French government spending is a component of that GDP.",0,1335125822,null,0,true,0,c4fbgy1,t3_smbai,t1_c4fbgy1,t1_c4fba0e,null,1428774227,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Today I participated in 97% Russian flash mob in German military jacket with German flags (I like military stuff, Germans always do it so well and had no time to remove flags). I am alive, no fights, no comments, no hatered.

Please, [do educate yourself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_Legion) on the topic before bullshitting. Amazig number of people do not know the diference between [Socialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism), [Communism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism), [Fascism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism) (please, do educate, it might come in handy)

So, yes, we do participate in honouring our heroes who fought for our freedom and I am honoured that I had the chance and did shake hands and sang with Latvian legionnaire. They have not participated in Holocaust. Their mission was to protect their lands against Russians. We also like to wave our flag once in a while, as most of you do. We have no hate against ""Russians"" if it is not another drunk russian fascist who have never been there and has no business there.

Nobody is Hitler nostalgic. Local scum, predominantly Russian speaking, is Stalin nostalgic. The rest of us, Latvians and sane Russian speaking people (these are growing!) believe that one country should not mess with another. It never ends well (Please, eductae yourself on Israeli-Palestine conflict, USA-Middle east conflict, Kosovo-Serbia, Georgia conflict).

We have lived in relative peace just until Kremlin sponsored dumbasses came first in parliament polls who spread stupid ideas which threatens EU, you so like to treasure, spreads lies and propaganda (For further reading google: Harmony centre Latvia).

Before pulling your finger out of the nose and pointing at somebody, please do look at [yourself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLUxuq-E9yA), your [kids](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4d7nZzg90s), [overall situation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9JDJdaMs-Y), and [watch what is happening around you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D49CVOlkpQI). We all may find very much corpses in every world countries backyard.

true,tugasnake,PORT,Portugal,"&gt; The escudo is worthless already, we could work as hard as possible, this little strip of land and some islands would still look laughable on its own when compared to the rest of the world. Besides, why bother so much with loans there when we could just print and print again? Trust me, the euro's strict rules are one of its key point. If we lose that obligation, we just wouldn't be trustworthy in the eyes of the world.

We have always been small, that didn't stop us from discovering most of the world and doing impressive things. Going back to the escudo we would likely lose a good chunk of our purchasing power, but on the long run nothing prevents us from having a stable currency with moderate inflation.

&gt;Failure of the single currency would mean we'd go back to competing with each other rather than with everyone else, we don't have that luxury again, as the rest of the world isn't owned by us. Competition is still very present, it just shifted its competitors. Saying we just stop working as a team so we could compete with each other, screw the USA, Brazil, Russia, India, China and Japan would be economical suicide, not to mention a much more uncertain and darker future for Europe.

Huh? Competition between countries is what made this continent great. We started the discoveries and in turn forced other countries to join in or be left behind. When we fell behind other European countries took our place and this went well untill the 20th century when the US seized the oportunity and became the world power. Our strength is our diversity, centralization of power slowly destroys that and puts all our eggs in the same basket. We dont need to adopt a federal structure like the US to be strong and face the rest of the world.

&gt;Too bad we no longer live in a closed economy. A small currency, even if properly managed, is just too easily overshadowed.

Sure we would lose the benefit of having the 2nd biggest reserve currency, but we would win back the sovereignty that we lost and prevent any further reduction of it, something that **will** happen if we remain in the EU and sell our soul for some more crack.

&gt;Try to convince foreigners of that.

That will be our job, and it's far from impossible.

If we don't take care of ourselves nobody will, remaining in the Euro and going further and further into debt while we lose our independence and assets is not going to solve anything. Defaulting and going back to the escudo is the best option. It's either that or say hello to the EU as a nation with capital in Brussels and control over the finances of all the member states, and the PIGS as the ugly ducks of the family.",0,1335133025,null,0,false,0,c4fcerk,t3_slfoh,t1_c4fcerk,t1_c4f1d10,null,1428774667,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,Nuyan,FRIE,Friesland,"Thanks. I already guessing it is the bond rates that you have to look at. France is a bit higher than the Netherlands, Germany and the US, but [it's at 3.5%](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/france/government-bond-yield) which is not too bad (although, the question is whether the European core-countries will ever start growing again at a healthy 3+% rate again in the future....). It's just that I notice people being absolutely hysterical about ratings, bonds and the need balance the budgets. In the Netherlands in public debate people are absolutely fixated on the 3% and the need for austerity. Merkozy's Holy Austerity Crusade is almost totally unquestioned even though there are plenty of economists (and not just radicals and niché bloggers, but people like a Krugman), and even the IMF, arguing against it. 

And I want to ask some more stupid questions... What are the ""markets"" that buy these bonds you talk about? Individuals, pension funds, other banks and countries? All these things right? And how does it work exactly? Does a government look at its budget and then raise the bonds it needs to fill the gaps? Just at a random occasion? Do they then sell it automatically which then directly add money to their account? I mean, is it computerized as finance these days often is, or do they actively have to find buyers. And does this selling of bonds then happen all the time or just once year? Just asking as I wonder why I see the graphs seem to fluctuate all the time. I'm sure that it also regularly happens that they strike a deal with some institution (country/bank/whatever) that ignores the market price. As in countries ""help"" each other with buying bonds for at a agreed lower price for example right? It can be part of political strategy with China consciously buying US bonds? Can the US actually decide to not sell to certain countries or is that against the rules? And again, how does that work exactly, is it just some dude in Beijing behind a computer that pushes a button and then buys millions of US bonds? Or am I confusing different things here?

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Let's start with the GP post to avoid confusion. Those interest rates like the 1% of the ECB (MRO for ""main refinancing operations"", its equivalents of other central banks go by different names) are what banks pay in interest when they borrow money from a central bank -- and for which they have to provide securities, e.g., government bonds that the central bank deems ""safe enough"", which used to mean AAA until this policy became somewhat inconvenient. The central bank sets this interest rate as a matter of monetary policy (i.e., it's decided by the central bank, not a result of market trading), it's the main instrument through which central banks influence the money supply. When it's high, money gets more ""expensive"", i.e., banks have to pay more interest on what they borrow from the central bank, which means they have to charge their customers more, so they think twice about purchasing decisions, which results in slower growth of the money supply and the economy. When it's low, as it is these days, money gets ""cheap"", interest rates for credit goes down, more purchases on credit are made (e.g., a company might decide that the cheap credit would make investments into new machines economically viable), and the economy grows. The downside is that inflation grows along with it. All this has preciously little to do with the interest rates that governments pay on their debt, though.

When you want credit, you go to a bank, and they will give you a credit window that you can draw from. With governments (and often large companies), this works differently. Instead, they sell off bonds. Those have a maturity date (when they have to be payed back) that can be anywhere from six months to many years in the future, the interest rates (better: ""yields"") that are typically quoted refer to ten year bonds. When you hear the term ""spread"", this refers to the difference between yields of the ten year government bond in question to that of a benchmark, which in Europe are Germany's ""bunds"".

How much this yield is is determined by the market. When new bonds are sold, they're auctioned off. Of course you don't have to keep them until their maturity date, but you can sell them. You can calculate what an equivalent interest rate would be, because you have the maturity date, the nominal value that will get payed back then, and what has just been payed. (Yes, they also have a nominal interest rate that pays out regularly, but this is hardly relevant here and simply gets priced into it during the auction. Just forget about that for simplicity's sake.)

This happens all the time. It's not just new debt; old bonds have to be payed back and replaced by new ones when they mature. This week, Italy will sell ten year bonds, and Germany will try to sell a couple billion worth of 32 year bonds (think about that for a moment, how the world and especially Germany has changed over the past 32 years).

Those 3.1% that France currently has to pay on ten year bonds would be OK under normal conditions, but they also mean that France is not seen as entirely safe anymore. The Netherlands pay 2.3% and Germany even only pays 1.7% at the moment (what's the ""spread"" of French bonds? 1.4%). To put this into perspective, the average spread of Greek bonds, from when they joined the Eurozone in 2001 to the onset of the financial crisis in 2007, was only slightly more than a quarter of a percent.",0,1335146567,null,0,false,0,c4fescv,t3_smbai,t1_c4fescv,t1_c4fcy6e,null,1428775788,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

They wanted less immigration, more police, less taxes and more economical and political independence of the richer northern Italy (one of their main slogans was 'Rome is a thief', referring to tax money being mostly spent in the poorer southern regions). They opposed Berlusconi at first due to the alleged Mafia relations (and that is a southern thing, right?), only to completely change opinion once they could use him to get into the parliament.

They managed to gather a significant consensus (they had over 14% at some point I think) using the usual cards of 'they're taking our jobs/stealing our stuff' and calling for secession of the north. This consensus came mainly from people in the richer, more industrialized zones who started seeing companies going bankrupt, jobs being lost to cheap immigrant laborers or outsourced to other countries and generally less money coming their way.

They invented a mythology about their ancient homeland and people (a non-existent Padania inhabited by celtic descendants, distinct from other Italians) and used that to rally a lot of 'naive' people as a start, then gathered more exploiting discontent and fear of change with harsh, direct language (""We'll ram our hard manhood in their butts"") and threats of radical action against the other corrupt parties.

Unfortunately this works a lot on the less educated segments of the population, and more educated people are happy to tag along once they see their interests being addressed, no matter the way.

The amount of honor the Germans had depends on the war period. In the beginning they were very honorable, but when they were getting low on officers, the quality of honor went down. Even though honor is an abstract concept, in it's core it is about standing for what is right, so when you are committing calculated war atrocities for your nation, I doubt any objective observer would call that honorable.

&gt;unlike others


There is nothing romantic in war, unless you are in some way fascist. A fascist outlook on the world is sick. Such nationalism and belief in a national myth requires a certain lack of creativity that only an oppressive regime can provide.

They're in league with two political parties that are taking classic right-wing steps in cutting the budget, but because of the left-wing social views of the PVV, they clash with the VVD and CDA. Wilders might hold most power in the party, but if a few of his lackies refuse to give the cabinet their vote, he can't do much about it.


If anyone is to blame, it's the fools who formed this cabinet in the first place. It 'works' during good times. They have so far refused to work with any other party (minus the SGP because of the CDA debacle with Koppejan and the other parlement member). But in bad times it just won't work. You got three parties that are ideologically opposed in many ways, a third member that bears no responsibility and who can let things collapse whenever it suits them and because the ruling parties smacked the opposition in the face many times before, they can't call on them to step into the breach until we can hold the next elections.


Rutte and Verhagen gambled and lost. Wilders just chipped in on their gamble, but never went all-in. We're all just blinded by our dislike of the PVV and haven't taken the time yet to think it all through.

2) In Estonia, any volunteers who joined the war joined it on the German side. That's because of the massive atrocities committed by the Russians before the Germans arrived in 1941. There were almost no volunteers for the Red Army, they had to be drafted forcefully.

These ""fascist"" celebrations only celebrate war veterans. And because they couldn't fight under the republic of Estonia, they did it under the Waffen SS.

USA is the largest member of NATO, and has always been the ""strong man"" in the group - deciding how the organization is set up, who should do what, etc. To ensure dominance (and for financial reasons) the big ticket items, and high cost to effect ratio items were allotted to the USA.

In the current security situation Europe is quite capable of defending itself. Regarding Libya, the USA was unwilling to take the lead due to financial and public relations reasons - they didn't want to be involved with another Afghanistan.

Second get off the high horse. Of course I heard about that ""research"", from Alfie Kohn and others. The only difference is that I have some common sense, _and I don't believe any stupid thing anyone in a lab coat would say_ as if it was scripture just because he is a ""scientist"". (Reddit has a strange fetish for science, but that is OK, but this kind of research isn't science but ""science"", ""smart sounding stuff"".) Such research is highly suspicious. It is only about the very intellectual kinds of jobs like teaching (Alfie Kohn) which are intrinsically rewarding. Most jobs are not intrinsically rewarding, not even white-collar ones. It forgets all the menial things which are more important given that the economic collapse is coming, due to the unmaintainability of social democracy. 

And fundamentally such ""research"" is mere about jobs / working when actually capital investment, consumption decisions and welfare are more important. This is a huge flaw.

Ultimately this kind of fluffy ""science"" can't trump basic logic - incentives matter. Not necessarily always material incentives, but incentives. Our whole economics, our whole history is a proof of it - most of the time people did decide about things not in their interests well. This is why communism collapsed and this is why social democracy must collapse, too (if it survives the demographic collapse first). 

The more intelligent socialists of the past did understand incentives, they simply promised socialism will reprogram human nature to be less selfish so incentives won't matter. Of course it was wrong and hence it collapsed. Now the more ignorant socialists of the present don't even understand the problem...

At least there's something we agree on. My position is that to make the world a better place we need to move away from material rewards and towards intrinsic rewards, social acceptance as an incentive with perhaps some glory and fame added to the mix. 

&gt; This is why communism collapsed and this is why social democracy must collapse, too (if it survives the demographic collapse first). 

That's a pretty broad statement with little evidence behind it. What do you mean communism collapsed? I wouldn't count the USSR as communist but let's say it was for the sake of argument. Then you must also accept that China is also communist and you can see that they're doing pretty well economically. With this simplistic definition of communism that you're using, communism is alive and well! If you don't accept that China is communist, then you'll have to explain what makes it so different from the USSR. 

As for social democracy, it hasn't collapsed yet. There is no correlation between the amount of socialist policies of countries and their position in the current financial crisis.

The current coalition of VVD/PVV/CDA loses 13 seats in total so they'd need a fourth party to make it work. We already know these three by themselves won't work, so we can scrap that possibility. 

The PVV goes from 24 to 19, the SP goes from 15 to 30. The PvdA goes down to 24. The SP won't ever work with the VVD, the PvdA is actively trying to scalp the VVD so I doubt that will happen. PvdA and CDA are seeking reconcilliation though, but they'd only come up with 35 seats together. Only wacky combinations seem to work - another purple cabinet with VVD/PvdA/D66/GroenLinks or a SP/PVV/whatever mix. 

I really hope that the media starts pointing at the huge role VVD and CDA played in getting us into the troubles we're in now, because they're truly the ones to blame. If you invite someone over for a business venture and wave away any and all responsibility on their side, you know they'll just abandon ship when things get rough and they can still get away with part of the plunder. 


Maybe the VVD will finally lose some of the angry-white-men votes (I sadly know a good bunch of VVD-voters who'd vote for Wilders in a heartbeat if it didn't leave them with a bad taste in their mouth if they had to admit it to their friends and family. Yeah, no comment). Maybe the CDA will regain some of their voterbase, but they'd need to select another leader AGAIN which I won't see happening. I do believe the SP is gonna lose a vote of 6 to 8 to the PvdA and that the only serious option we'll have is a purple social-liberal cabinet with PvdA/D66/VVD but that means Rutte will have to return to his original colors - that of a left'ish liberal. Right now the VVD is mimicking some of the PVV's point of views, albeit in a socially acceptable fashion. The CDA have been doing the same. With the advent of the economical crisis hopefully the focus of the populace shifts from crime+foreigners to getting our shit back in order and for that, we need our parties to actually have proper economical situations - something that for example the PVV is severely lacking.

Possibilities for a 3 party coalitions are (source: Maurice de Hond):

* VVD + SP + D66 (15) = 78

VVD and SP are the opposite of eachother. They differ so much, that they wouldn't get an agreement. Or they would get a agreement but fall in a couple of months/years.

Two, you're mixing up two things, I'd say. Is European military spending too low for defense purposes, as defined by European interests? I don't know for sure, but perhaps it is. Probably not by a large margin, though. On the other hand, is European military spending too low for the ""power projection"" you mention? It most certainly is! However, this could also be due to a lack of interest of (most) European nations to project power beyond the borders of Europe.

Is Europe then ""freeloading"" on US military and its ability to project power and act as ""world police""? Yes, in a sense. But that is because so far, that deal has been rather sweet for Europe, in financial terms. However, if the US decides to change the rules and is no longer willing to pay an disproportionally large part of the overall military budget necessary to keep NATO in its current form, don't count on Europe to pay higher contributions: I for one am perfectly content with a European military oriented towards defense, not power projection. 

The details are up for debate (Germany's military budget is probably even too low for an effective defense-oriented army), but let's not assume that Europe actually is willing (or *should* be willing) to pay full price for a service that has been offered to them for at a greatly reduced price until now.

I'm a bit puzzled about the situation in Spain. I understand (through discussion on r/Europe and some reading of my own) that the situation in Spain, before the crisis hit, as well as now, is substantially different from, say, Greece. According to my limited understanding, the two main problems in Spain were (and still are, I suppose) 1) a real estate bubble (which lead to high private debt and an instable financial industry) and 2) a (probably structural) unemployment problem (""structural"", since it already existed before the crisis), which is likely among the causal effects for a low GDP growth.

I am wondering now what the solution is. I understand that austerity should not be the biggest goal in the case of Spain, but what makes some people so sure in their belief that (EU funded) stimulus is the way to go? Wouldn't the existence of a real estate bubble actually indicate that the Spanish economy will inevitably (even though not necessarily painlessly) have to go through a shrinking process, to go back to pre-bubble size?

&gt; Two, you're mixing up two things

I'm not, defence does not necessarily end at your front door. The interests of the EU lies well outside of its borders. Shipping lanes for example are of importance to the EU and its trade partners. 

Oil too is an issue. If something were to happen in the middle east or in Russia - civil war for example - which leads to the EU freezing should not the EU be able to step in and assist militarily with one side or the other to ensure that the country becomes stable and its own interests are met? 

It is incredibly narrow minded to assume that defence begins at the same line of the border. 

Furthermore, if a conventional ground war were to start most of the military assets are in the wrong place. It is highly unlikely that an invasion will begin from the Atlantic since it is so damned big, but the two biggest military spenders have their forces there. How long would it take to mobilise forces to defend Poland for example? Or Latvia? 

&gt; that deal has been rather sweet for Europe, in financial terms.

Yes, it has. Agreed.

&gt; don't count on Europe to pay higher contributions: I for one am perfectly content with a European military oriented towards defense, not power projection. 

I'm not a doom-monger and neither do I think that around every corner is an enemy, but we (read EU) do need to consider our own safety and existance with a bit more of a consideration than that of a depressed lemming. China is dramatically increasing its miliary power - it wants to defend its way of life which does not sit nicely with Western liberalism.

&gt; but let's not assume that Europe actually is willing (or should be willing) to pay full price for a service that has been offered to them for at a greatly reduced price until now.

It is Europes biggest mistake having lived under the umbrella of someone else to assume that it never rains. Before WW1 and to some 
extent WW2 most people assumed there would never be war again.

Look, I'm sorry, but you are. Defense and power projection are two distinct things, in terms of what kind of military you need, let's please not fool ourselves there. However, what you essentially say is that an effective defense also needs to include the capability to strike out first, or at least strike beyond your borders. And I happen to disagree with that point.

This is a topic of its own, so I'm not sure if I want to discuss it here[1], but since the initial argument was about ""European freeloading"", it is not really all that relevant if your position (""good defense needs offense capabilities"" -- is that an acceptable summary?) or my position (""pure defense is enough for Europe"") is correct, since my whole point was that Europe, by and large, willl probably favor a ""pure defense"" approach if we were to be asked to pay the full price for the other option.

Whatever law or rule there is, someone will come around wanting to do something that can't be done and, knowing the right people, will get his way. Laws and rules sometimes seem to be there for show so people can say ""see, you can't do that"", then turn around and go to their uncle's cousin's mother in law to skip the line for the X-ray or to get that position in the tax office.

This has a twofold effect: the important jobs get done by incompetent people who don't give a crap, while good, honest people get frustrated and give up. Plus, with the goal to prevent this, we get even more crazy, absurd useless laws (want a license? Ok, I need 41 certificates and 17 approvals. Oh you are aunt Marta's third cousin? Let's get you this license ready, and thank her for that thing at the hospital!)

The clearest example of this is the selection system for public jobs, from tax accountants to magistrates and university professors. To select the 'best' candidate there are public selection exams with a fixed number of positions. Typically you get 5000+ candidates for maybe 300 spots, only that you have to study hard and go there knowing that 100 of those spots are already gone and you'll see ignorant assholes walk ahead of you without having worked a minute for it.

This is so ingrained and usual that sometimes you'll be told outright that the selection exam is fake, so you'd better save yourself the trip.
When someone instead tries to rock the boat and blow the whistle he'll most likely be ostracized, so he'll be out of a job and the time he spent on the issue, if not worse. And the same goes for most public tenders of course.

Going back to the escudo we would likely lose a good chunk of our purchasing power, but on the long run nothing prevents us from having a stable currency with moderate inflation.

Comparing the world 500 years ago with the world today is just wrong. Also, you can't just say ""well, if we work our asses off we might have a chance of not collapsing"", that ludicrous, we are fine the way we are and things are much safer and easy with the euro, a common currency for Europe which deepens the single market and gives increased assurances to those willing to invest here.

&gt;Huh? Competition between countries is what made this continent great. We started the discoveries and in turn forced other countries to join in or be left behind. When we fell behind other European countries took our place and this went well untill the 20th century when the US seized the oportunity and became the world power.

There's probably more competition now than there ever was before, in this globalized world. We're just focused on not fighting amongst ourselves and attempting to work as a team so we can stand a chance against the other continents who were once in our control.

&gt;Our strength is our diversity, centralization of power slowly destroys that and puts all our eggs in the same basket. We dont need to adopt a federal structure like the US to be strong and face the rest of the world.

I fail to see how a single voice of the EU and the centralization of some legal procedures is harmful for our efforts or is ""putting all our eggs on the same basket"". As for the federal structure, it might not be necessary but it can certainly be helpful.

&gt;Sure we would lose the benefit of having the 2nd biggest reserve currency, but we would win back the sovereignty that we lost and prevent any further reduction of it, something that will happen if we remain in the EU and sell our soul for some more crack.

I for one am happy that our leaders can't just do what for example Venezuela does, which is not attempt to cut costs and just delay the problems by increasing inflation and weakening the currency. The escudo is dead, long live the euro.

&gt;That will be our job, and it's far from impossible.

Or we could not be masochistic and try to work as a team to allow for a better future for all of us.

&gt;If we don't take care of ourselves nobody will, remaining in the Euro and going further and further into debt while we lose our independence and assets is not going to solve anything. Defaulting and going back to the escudo is the best option. It's either that or say hello to the EU as a nation with capital in Brussels and control over the finances of all the member states, and the PIGS as the ugly ducks of the family.

Going further and further into debt isn't the EU's fault, it's our politician's one, in fact, the EU is the entity which has helped us the most, both monetarily and not, in trying to make sure our budgets didn't showed negative results frequently.
Defaulting and going back to the escudo is the worst option, it would mean just like that that we all would lose some 20% or 30% of our wealth, it's like trying to treat a broken finger with arm amputation.
As for the PIGS, we just have to work as much as the rest of Europe does so that there are no ugly ducks in this big European family.",0,1335197959,null,0,false,0,c4flx5r,t3_slfoh,t1_c4flx5r,t1_c4fcerk,null,1428779217,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

En déclarant la « guerre au monde de la finance » au Bourget, il met quand même un tas de gens dans le même panier.

Le repli sur soi, c'est de dire qu'on va « s'affranchir du traité de Lisbonne » alors que ça serait inacceptable pour les partenaires européens.

* In seinen diversen Folgeprojekten führte der Mann aus Detroit **das** unverdrossen fort, **was** ihn zur Ikone des Garagenrock werden ließ.

""was"" refers to originally omitted ""das"", working as an Akkusativobjekt. The meaning is therefore different from your translation. Your translation implies his sideprojects made him an icon, while the original sentence implies, he just did in his sideprojects, what he did before and what made him an icon in the first place.

I don't want to confuse you more than necessary, but to get your implied meaning I could split the sentence like this:

* In seinen diversen Folgeprojekten führte der Mann aus Detroit (was? seine Arbeit/Musik! ""fortführen"" demands an object to make sense.) unverdrossen fort. Dies ließ ihn zur Ikone des Garagenrock werden. 

So the Nebensatz is a necessary part of the Hauptsatz. You could not delete it without the Hauptsatz losing its meaning. ""In seinen diversen Folgeprojekten führte der Mann aus Detroit unverdrossen fort."" is not a valid German sentence. But ""The man from Detroit continued persistently in his diverse sideprojects."" is a valid english sentence. The difference lies in the verb ""fortführen"" which has a different [valency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valency_%28linguistics%29) than ""continue"". IF the original sentence would have been:

* In seinen diversen Folgeprojekten **machte** der Mann aus Detroit unverdrossen **weiter**, was ihn zur Ikone des Garagenrock werden ließ.

Your translation would be one of the 2 possible translations into english, the other one still being mine.

I'm born in the South and I've lived in the South for my entire life (those waves next to my nickname are [Basilicata's flag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilicata)), and I know that we are very loud. I am loud too sometimes, and I don't even realize it if no one make me notice it (and when that happens I smile and I say that I'm sorry and that I'll try to keep it down). It's not racism to say that Southern people are loud, it's just a cultural thing.

I find crosses everywhere in my city: in restaurants, in shops, in schools (I work in a middle school and each class has its cross on the wall), just the other day I even found it in a national museum (and I don't mean as a part of the exhibition, of course).

About the garbage I think you misunderstood: I wasn't talking about Naples-like emergencies, but about everyday paper litters that you can unfortunately find in about every Italian city, and even in the woods, on the beaches and so on. Yesterday I went hiking on the hills around my city and just in one morning I found among the bushes several plastic bags, papers, empty cans and bottles and one whole sofa, I kid you not. Most people just don't care about environment and throw anything wherever they are, and you cannot say this is not true.  
I don't know why you assumed I don't do anything about it, because I always get in a fight with my friends when I spot them throwing something in the streets, and I often join Legambiente's initiatives to clean cities and nature ([Puliamo il mondo](http://www.puliamoilmondo.it/)).

true,still_available,null,null,"Italy is the fourth country I live in so I suppose I can compare and give some honest opinion on the things that spoil otherwise beautiful country of awesome people.

Locals as in any other country, tend to exaggerate about the problem and describe the common problems as something specific to their country. Like bad roads, bureaucratic stupidity or corruption or employment crisis. This is all relative. Let me list some specific to Italy that I haven't seen in other countries.

*  Payments between the companies. Have you ever heard of anything like 120 days of post-payed invoice? I didn't until I came here. And 120 is not the worst. This creates a real problem for the small and medium business development. Thus slows down the economy. Constant lack of capital.

* Nepotism. Or better the acceptance of it. People speak openly about exchange of favors. Most visible in the politics, less visible but much more disturbing in the business. Not only the public tenders (worst results) but also companies hiring other companies or buying services from the companies ""A brother of my school mate"" works in. The result is usually money spent bad and the customer is the first to suffer and overpay.

* Low ambitions, Most of Italians I deal with daily don't show them. As a result they lack initiative and tend to ruin their own country's development. Not all. But too many when I compare them to other countries.  Italians are not hard workers, not lazy, just not hard workers.

* Taxes evasion. This is something really horrible. The taxes are evaded in every country, but here, not paying taxes is a norm. You hear people speak loudly in public places about not paying taxes and how to do the best to steal from their own society. As the result, taxes are high and get higher every year and more and more people evade.

* Bella figura. Well, this one is hard to explain. Let me start from the fact that there are two sayings in Italian that don't exist in other languages. ""Fare bella figura""  and ""Fare brutta figura"", with minor variations in vulgarity. Literally it translates into ""Do a beautiful person"" and ""Do an ugly person"". The closest meaning in English I can find is ""Not to loose your face"" or ""To loose your face"". How others see you is very important for an average Italian. Much more important than in any other culture I know about. This is about what you wear and how, what you buy and where, how many times you went on vacation. The opinion in general. Less important how actually you enjoy what you do, but much more important what others say about it. I've couldn't really adapt to it in seven years and still don't wear the tie when I have a meeting with a client :) but then my accent helps!

* Lack of public transportation infrastructure. What Italy has is just a disaster. Imagine going from one city to another which are ~50km distance. On a train you have to make 150. This is common. So people tend to buy more cars (Italy is the first in Europe per capita, 1.7 cars if I remember correctly). Result is constant traffic jams and high levels of pollution. Not to mention the economy damage from delays.

Now, that is pretty much all I can think about. The rest of the problems is common to other countries. And even these I've listed are not that bad as soon as you get to know the system and know how to deal with. Adaptation is what humans are famous for :)

Italy is a great place to live, your friend will have lots of good time here :) I'm here almost seven years and don't regret my stay.

It's a pity for Rutte and Verhagen Wilders negotiated for 7 week and only told on the last day the deal was off. Wilders' excuse for withdrawing don't stand either. He claims to defend the old people here, but just like everyone else, they can't avoid feeling a some pain from the recession. Also, the 3% rule is far from being a dictate out of Brussel. It is something the Netherlands itself agreed on, with Wilders screaming the loudest to keep it enforced when South Europe was the subject.

However, Rutte and Verhagen shouldn't play innocent either. They have been warned time and time again Wilders' PVV was an unstable party, both by CDA and VVD members and outsiders, during the formation and when the budget cut negotiations started 7 week ago. It is understandable Rutte needed to find a way to get some plans trough with the fragmented political landscape that appeared after the 2010 elections, but he was told often enough the PVV was unstable, stubborn and freakish.

Geert Wilders leaves negotiations because last few months, his party collapses below him, with high key figure Hero Brinkman leaving, the party causing the coalition of VVD, CDA and PVV in the province of Limburg to fall and many more party deserters. Wilders needs his hands free of a support construction to be able to shout what populist creed he wants to shout to salvage what support he has left. 

CDA's Maxime Verhagen knows this is the end of his political career, since he gambled too much on this coalition and was resented for it, even by his own party. This explains his bitterness after the negotiations botched last Saturday.

VVD's Mark Rutte, PM, gambled the PVV could provide him with support for his economic plans and containing Wilders sort of in the government would remove Wilder's venom a bit. Rutte gambled wrong. However, having held his head high, I believe Rutte will be able to continue as leader of the VVD largely unscratched. He could continue to become Prime Minister of a purple Rutte II. Seeing how he cooperated with the PVV out of pragmatic reasons, he could pretty much do the same with left wing parties.

Vrai cf. [wiki](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Hollande#Origines.2C_.C3.A9tudes_et_famille) (après, de l'intérêt de l'info...)

&gt; J’ai passé mon enfance à Bois-Guillaume, ville résidentielle (sur les hauteurs de Rouen) où habitent les plus riches normands.

Même chose que plus haut (pour la 1e partie), j'ai pas vérifié l'info sur la démographie (mais décidément, ça a l'air d'être interdit d'être riche et de gauche, oulala)

&gt; Puis j’ai continué mes études dans la commune des aristocrates et des grands-bourgeois : à NEUILLY SUR SEINE où mes parents avaient acheté une superbe propriété.

Tout pareil qu'au dessus.

&gt; Malgré ma fortune et mon patrimoine estimé à plus de 10 Millions d’Euros, je ne paie pas l’ISF car un montage ingénieux sous forme de plusieurs SCI me rend quasiment introuvable par le fisc français

 Si j'en crois sa [déclaration de patrimoine](http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/tout-savoir-du-patrimoine-des-candidats-a-la-presidentielle_1085887.html), il a bien **une** SCI mais on est loin, très loin du chiffre fumeux de 10 millions d'euros. On est déjà plus loin du ""montage ingénieux"".

&gt; A la fin des années 70, sortant de l’ENA je sens que la droite va perdre et que Mitterrand est sur la pente ascendante, pour assurer mon avenir je choisis alors de rejoindre le PS.

Tout ce que j'ai trouvé c'est un [article de Ru89](http://www.rue89.com/comment/2734071) qui semble plutôt pointer que ses débuts politiques flirtaient avec l'extrême gauche (il rentre à l'UNEF à Sciences Po) ce qui semble contrer cette affirmation.

&gt; Je n’ai jamais dirigé une grande ville. Je n’ai jamais dirigé une grande région. Je n’ai jamais été ministre ni secrétaire d’état.

La rengaine classique habituelle. Pas besoin de sources ici je pense.

&gt; Je dirige malgré tout le département de la Corrèze qui est devenu grâce à moi en 4 ans le plus endetté de France (+ 25% de dette soit 3 fois plus que la moyenne nationale)

Celui là, [je l'aime beaucoup](http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2012/article/2012/02/22/le-caricatural-exemple-correzien-de-l-ump_1646127_1471069.html).

&gt; Pour 2012 dans mon département, j’ai déjà fait voter une hausse de 6.5% de la taxe foncière, de 300% les taxes sur les permis de construire. J’ai supprimé : les bourses étudiantes, la gratuité des transports scolaires, les 1000 € de prime de garde d’enfants et diminué presque toutes les aides aux personnes âgées ou dépendantes.

Je n'ai pas tout trouvé. C'est exact pour les [transports scolaires](http://www.wk-transport-logistique.fr/actualites/detail/47991/transports-scolaires-la-correze-renonce-a-la-gratuite.html) semble-t-il... Sauf que ces économies semblent du coup totalement sensées (du moins d'après le raisonnement de ce pamphlet) vue la situation du département si on lit l'article juste au dessus !

&gt; J’envisage d’augmenter de 45 milliards d’euros les impôts et taxes en tout genre

C'est [vrai mais il n'est pas le seul, eh ](http://desintox.blogs.liberation.fr/blog/2012/03/la-fiscalit%C3%A9-revee-de-laurent-wauquiez-.html) : ce n'est pas lui qui vient d'augmenter la TVA, ou alors on me mentirait ?

&gt; Je n’aime pas les riches qui gagnent plus de 4000 euros par mois 

Une [bonne grosse intox](http://desintox.blogs.liberation.fr/blog/2012/01/hollande-et-les-riches-wauquiez-recycle-une-vieille-intox-de-2007.html) (décidément M. Wauquiez, qu'est ce que vous apportez au débat public !)

&gt; mais j’en gagne 7,5 fois plus avec mes 30.387 € par mois ! 

""Député et président du conseil général de la Corrèze, il perçoit des indemnités mensuelles limitées, en fonction du cumul des mandats, à environ 8 300 euros brut (hors indemnités). "" ([source l'Express](http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/patrimoine-de-francois-hollande-d-un-couple-a-l-autre_1084958.html))

&gt; Donc 63% de plus que le Président de la République (19 331 € par mois)

A recalculer plus précisément parce que ce n'est [pas fixe](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9mun%C3%A9ration_des_%C3%A9lus_politiques_en_France#Pr.C3.A9sident_de_la_R.C3.A9publique), mais Wikipédia donne 20963 € pour 2008. On va arrondir à 21000€ parce que j'ai la flemme, ce qui nous donne 2,5 fois plus que le petit François. De quoi le motiver pour devenir président, vu qu'apparemment c'est un bourgeois assoiffé d'argent qui nous vient de Neuilly !

&gt; que j’accuse d’être proche des riches…
