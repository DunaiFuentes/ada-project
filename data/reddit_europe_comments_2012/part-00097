true,eberkut,EURO,European Union,"Listen, I answered very succintly one of the point you raised because I don't have the time nor the will to answer your other point especially since the way you just repeat again and again and again the same thing (and not only in this thread) makes you look like you already have a very strong opinion that's unlikely to evolve. I just wanted to point out quickly that unlike you paint it there are solutions. You might not believe in it but they do exist at least on paper.

To wrap it up:

- Please elaborate  when you say the majority of the EZ member 
cheated. Greece most obviously did. That's one. Germany, France and Italy bended the Maastricht rules. It was not very wise but it was legal and it wasn't much opposed at the time. I think you're exaggerating this point as well as the corruption.

- There is an opportunity member states will change their behavior because of the crisis. What looked like a very remote threat is now clear to everyone. The EU has never evolved has quickly as it had in the past two years which is a clear sign that member state are willing to move forward. It is however understandable that it is difficult to bridge profound disagreements over policies in an emergency situation and as such it does take some time to implement solution even though most were laid out even before 2009.

- It's actually mildly amusing to watch eurosceptics bash the EU for not acting quickly enough (in implementing new decisions or even in reaching consensus) or for not bending the rules (like the ECB refusing to act as a lender of last resort because of the Maastricht Treaty) while at the same time blaming it for not being democratic enough or corrupt.

- I do agree with you that most people don't seem to care what happens to the EU. Maybe they don't understand. Maybe in harsh times it's more difficult to see beyond your own personal interest. Still, nobody is willing to leave the EU right now, not even Britain.

Different problems. Again we need more sustainable businesses and less bubble-like investments. In relation to the manufacturing economy, while we trade with countries with different and more lenient labor laws, it'll always be crappy. The same applies to the US and to Europe. Spanish coal isn't affordable because the mining companies have to actually care and zeal for their employees. American rare earths are not profitable because China doesn't really give a damn about the environment. I can keep escalating these examples.

&gt; It's also worth noting that Portugal and to a lesser extent Italy did not really have massive bubbles. They just had chronically bad growth(aka: was not competitive) which eventually led to contraction and recession as the rest of the world dealt with their real estate bubbles.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I'd struggle to call the USSR and China successful, both had mass starvations and epically autocratic regimes which saw their technology level fall dramatically in relation to the much more open West. By what measure would you deem them successful?

These economies are the only ones that managed a catch up movement of a magnitude never seen before. Under Mao life expectancy rose each year (from 35 to 65), food production rose with 169%, population grew with 77%, per capita food with about 80% and most strikingly, value of industry in the GDP went from 36% to 72%.

The USSR went from a backwards serf nation to an industrial powerhouse at odds of the US with less of the population.

The government of Imperial Japan created a modern institutional framework to support an advanced capitalist economy. Japan is not a rich island, without this crucial fase they would be irrelevant now.

A planned economy and the controlling of markets (tarrifs etc.) is essential for a catch up economy. Autocracy and oppressing of the population is a bonus too. When all this succeeds you can gradually relinquish sectors to the global forces of the market, as the British Empire did for the first time, Japan did and China is doing now. Even the U.S. fought a civil war partly inspired to impose tarrifs so it's economy could catch up to that of Europe.

This discussion is hardly on topic, but it proves that different situations need different economic visions. Also that the same rigid system will not survive forever. Look at the decline of the USSR for example. We must be ready to adapt, certainly in a crisis. And what we need now is massive investment, internationally.

true,Vlip,SWIT,Switzerland,"There are a lot of misconceptions in this thread.Allow me to bring you a Swiss perspective.First, about our tax rates. Those are set at the cantonal level and the federal level has basically no power on those issues. So pressuring our federal government is not going to get you anything other than pissed off cantons. Your negotiating partners on this would be the cantons themselves and in any cases it's going to be a rough battle because if the cantons don't like the Swiss federal government telling them how to set up their taxes, imagine how they'll react when it'll come from other countries (just think how you'd react if, say, China started pressuring your country to raise your taxes).On the subject of our banks. I don't think the Swiss people particularly care for the tax evaders using our system. The crux of what we care about is privacy. A right which is enshrined in our constitution and that is taken very seriously here.We have a deal with England, Austria and Germany which solves the problem of tax evasion without losing privacy.Basically it forces the banks to automatically tax the accounts of those countries' nationals at a default rate that is higher than the real tax rate. The banks just dump the money in a single paiement so noone knows who owns how much.Then everyone can chose to either declare his bank account and get reimbursed the difference between the actual tax rate they own and the default tax rate or they can just eat the default tax rate and keep their money secret (this can be useful when your country decides to confiscate the money of some population segments, it happened a few times in Europe in the 20th century).This deal was accepted by the Brits, the Austrians and has wide popular support in Switzerland. Some Germans are blocking theirs because they want to retroactively tax those accounts at up to 75% O_O. Switzerland has a problem with that since according to our laws those persons did nothing illegal and we can't retroactively strip them of three quarters of their assets for breaking a law that didn't exist at the time.There is a retroactive taxation at a more sensible rate in the deal though.So basically some Germans have been blocking the new system that would fix the tax evasion problem because they want revenge on those who put money in Swiss banks.Last but not least, I'd like to remind everyone that London is also a very popular place to evade taxation.

One of my professors challenged me to start deciphering why Switzerland can seem so wonderful yet house so much corrupt money etc. And it almost seems that such an idyllic existence is enabled by the abundance of money at first glance. There isn't really anything to be done without stepping on the toes and rights of individuals and Switzerland's sovereignty. 

More so than just housing tax evasion money, there is an abundance of money from third world dictators and the like being stored there. Money doesn't get much dirtier than the money in Swiss banks. But that isn't to say a majority of the money is corrupt, just that the majority of corrupt money seems to find its way there.

I agree that the important thing is that roads (as an example) exist and are maintained by the state, and that anyone can use them freely. If they use them to get rich, good for them.

But I often hear how the rich have earned their wealth with hard work and dedication and we should respect them for that, which may be true, but that's just one side of the coin. The other side is the society and culture that let them thrive to get filthy rich, and I think both sides deserve equal respect. Getting the same standard of living like George Clooney is outright impossible if you're alone on a deserted island, no matter how much hard work and dedication you can muster -- and even if you're George Clooney.

&gt; I think it's impossible to determine the optimal level of compensation, and trying to set it could do more harm than good.

It's impossible because that's a political question. There are tons of those: Should we banish nuclear power? Should parents be allowed to circumcise their children? Should drugs be legalized? Should we give more support to education or to charity? There are no perfect answers because politics is not science.

We already do tax rich people higher than poor people, so there is some sort of acknowledgement. And I think that is actually the best answer, currently. Announcing that every Euro above 1 million (or any other number) will now be taxed with 100 % would be like reintroducing slavery. Nobody would accept it. (Besides me. :))

&gt; setting the bar at 1 million seems to low, especially when it concerns people saving up for retirement etc.

Again, if the alternative is an Euro that's not worth the paper it's printed on, the choice is easy. But there will be no choice because we don't know what will happen, we can only guess and listen to anyone who consideres himself an expert and then come up with some decision that's probably another shitty compromise.

true,argh523,SWIT,Switzerland,"**The actual problem is this:** under swiss law, tax evasion is not considered a serious crime, as opposed to tax *fraud*. Evaison is when you ""forget"" to declare something, and it is only a ""breach of the law"", not a criminal offence. Fraud is faking documents etc.  
Now, when a foreign government suspects one of its citizens evades taxes with money on foreign bank accounts, it cooperates with the government to get the information on those accounts. But this doesn't work in switzerland, because this ""administrative assistance"" to other countries is only given when the accusations concern criminal activities. And tax evasion, in switzerland, is not a crime, just a breach of the law (like a parking ticket). 

Now, in recent years a lot of things have happened. It's not that we are all proud the help in tax evasion, but this automatic data transfer, where, as a result, the american government can just access any swiss citizens financial information without a real justification is just a *tiny bit* crazy in your eyes.

One thing that's happend is that this ""administrative assistance"" is now given in cases of tax evasion. In switzerland, some people called that the ""death of the bank secrecy!"", but that's only the populists, most people don't mind. But many countries don't think that's inoff, because they still need to make a case, have some justification that someone is evading taxes. They would prefere if they could just access the data, like they can with many other countries, but that goes to far for us.  
Instead, we want to make treaties that use incentives like the withholidng tax. Explanation: On all earnings on intrest, shares etc. there is a tax that is collected directly (35%), and when you declare those earnings on your tax return you get the money back. And because the normal taxes are lower than the withholding tax, you are going to do that. That tool is used around the world in many different situations.  
But foreigners who live in countries with higher income taxes or high wealth taxes might save some money by hording it on swiss bank accounts, even when they loose the withholding tax. But with those treaties, it could be made so that there is, for example, a higher withholding tax for all germans who use swiss bank accounts, and the actual money from the tax goes to the german government. And that's exactly what we did in recent years.  
*see Vlip's big post, he goes into more detail*

The post is long enough now, but on last thing: As a redditor, you might be aware of all the talk about government control of the internet, ""pre-emptive"" data collection through ISP's and telephone companies, maybe even intelligence agencies etc. This whole tax heaven thing is not so black and white as it may seem, full compliance with what the bigger nations want is a serious privacy problem. And honestly, to me this whole thing seems to be more about ""look, we are doing something **strong** against those evil banks!"", when ~~actual~~ issues like transaction taxes (high frequency trading), the mixing of investment banks and real banks, potentialy dangerous finacial products etc. are just too hard to address.

**TL;DR** A lot has changed in practice in recent years. It's an easy target for polititians to look strong. It's more complicated than you might think, because privacy is a big issue for our side, and the easy solutions other nations want us to adapt are very bad for privacy.

Here's an example. In our plan, we travelled Milan to Siena one day, the next Siena to Naples. On the saturday, the train was late, which is pretty normal. However, when we got to Siena, we realised that the local bus that takes you from the train station to the town had stopped because it was a weekend. It was extremely difficult as a result to get into the town. The next day, Siena to Naples, there was a forced stop in a random town and the train was delayed for 4 hours. When it did arrive, they told us that there was an issue with the train and we'd have to transfer to another in Rome to make the final part of the trip. Trouble with that was that they hadn't informed the other train that this was happening, which ended up leaving a mess of passengers yelling to be let on the train because we all paid and we all needed to get to Naples. It was very lucky that the attendants just let us on and assumed we were telling the truth or we would have been stranded. In saying that, it was very lucky that our train even came despite the 4 hour delay in that random town. We would have been really screwed at that point. I did many crosswords that day from the sheer boredom of sitting on one platform in the middle of the day in a town I didn't even know about on the off chance that my train turned up.

You're probably reading this and thinking, meh, that's not something I can predict and that was probably bad luck. But from having travelled extensively on both weekdays and weekends, I can definitely vouch for weekday trips running smoother whereas nearly every weekend trip we did was a disaster. If you do travel on weekend, be prepared for delays and cancellations and be prepared to have to be flexible with your schedule because things just do not run on time in that country. 

Hopefully that helps :) Any other questions? You said up top that you had a few concerns/questions about travelling. I'd be more than happy to give any advice if you should need it!",0,1343521477,null,0,false,0,c5kwj45,t3_x9xym,t1_c5kwj45,t1_c5kni5b,null,1429495648,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

true,lockdownit,cinefilo,,"ok, c'è un problema. Lo sai qual'è il problema? che i meme hanno sforato, e sono diventati mainstream.

non dovrei difendermi dall'accusa che sia hipster lamentarmene... ma si; mi piacevano i meme prima che piacessero a tutti. E non per una questione di elitaria superiorità, ma anzi per l'opposto. I fumetti disegnati male, sostituiti pian piano dai ragecomics, nascono in ultima analisi da 4chan, che è il buco del culo dell'internet. Come """"""""brand"""""" identificavano chi capiva cosa c'era dietro il fumetto come appartenente alla subcultura de ""benvenuto nel fondo dell'internet, questa è la tua pala, preparati al peggio"". 

4chan era un posto duro e brutale, che forgiava a colpi di gore e image macro schiere di anon che non avrebbero battuto ciglio davanti ad una foto di un cranio sventrato dopo un incidente stradale, con un cinismo fuori scala e un senso dell'umorismo quanto mai deviato.

Poi pian piano diversi siti (icanhazcheeseburger, per dirne uno, e più recentemente 9gag, ma anche ovviamente reddit) hanno iniziato a saccheggiare 4chan, tenendo i jokes più puliti per poi riportarli. come quando racconti una barzelletta di pierino ai tuoi genitori, e invece di dire cazzo dici cacchio. Però comunque l'umorismo rimaneva in questi ragecomics, erano apprezzabili. erano divertenti. E la cosa si è espansa, è arrivata su facebook, e da lì ai ragazzini, ed ora è di pubblico dominio.

Non dico che la cosa mi dia fastidio perchè prima facevo parte di un club settario segreto ed ora non ho più il mio palloncino viola di membro numero cento; E' comunque un fastidio che nasce dal vedere la propria sottocultura presa, brutalizzata, stuprata e venduta al pubblico. Ed è una cosa che a me personalmente è successa cento volte; prima essere un Nerd era un insulto, mentre adesso ""lol lol sono troppo nerd big bang theory star trek lol lol"". Prima essere un gamer era essere un pò quello sfigato che il sabato sera sta in casa con la ps1 invece che andare in disco, mentre ora ""OMFG COD COD HALO TI HO TROPPO UCCISO MINCHIA MI HA SNIPPATO OH"". Una volta essere un internauta (tremo) voleva dire trovare newsgroup, canali irc, isti dedicati alle passioni frequentati da altre persone like-minded; oggi è ""CLICCA LIKE E SHARE S ENON VUOI CHE ALLA PICCOLA MARIA TOLGANO LE CURE NECESSARIE I MEDICI CATTIVI UN EURO PER OGNI SHARE SO CHE IL 94% DI VOI NON LO FARA :("".

E uno dice ""ma fregatene, continua a fare quello che facevi prima e sticazzi dei posers"". Ok, certo. Posso continuare a sbavare dietro componenti avveniristici per pc, visto che comunque è roba troppo complessa per i ""nerd"" del giorno d'oggi. Ma non posso sperare in una nuova serie di IT Crowd, perchè quello che tira è Big Bang Theory. Non posso andare in fumetteria senza sentire ""boh batman non lo so i fumetti vecchi sono troppo cupi, poi ho provato a leggere il ritorno del cavaliere oscuro e non centra con film, lui è un vecchio..."". Gamer? men che meno. Se entro da gamestop, il commesso (bontà sua) cerca di farmi preordinare l'ultimo sparatutto. ""non mi piaccono molto gli sparatutto, no, neanche i giochi di sport..."" ""ah ma che console hai?"" ""in realtà tutte e tre, l'xbox è una delle prime uscite e poi pian piano ho preso le altre..."" ""ma sei appassionato quindi!"" ""beh si..."" ""e non ti piacciono gli sparatutto o i giochi di calcio?"" ""no..."" ""e allora a cosa giochi?"". A quei quattro titoli all'anno che non sono prodotti per il mercato di massa di bambini imbecilli e adolescenti ubriachi. Perchè adesso pure questo è un business in cui non conta l'idea, il cuore, il guizzo; Conta far uscire fifa 2013 dopo fifa 2012 con le formazioni aggiornate, e codblops 2 dopo codblops con più fucili, più bombe, più tutto. 

Ogni volta che vedo una maglietta con la coolface non posso che chiedermi se non ci sia un troll infinito dietro la svendita al pubblico di una subcultura. ma purtroppo come sempre ci sono solo i soldi. E chi grazie a quella subcultura tirava avanti, perchè solo in 4chan trovava menti affini, solo in 4chan aveva un posto dove nessuno rompeva i coglioni o lo giudicava, si ritrova col culo per terra. I know that feel, bro.

Reddit, poi, è forse il posto peggiore; vorrebbe essere ""4chan with pants on"". fanculo. fanculo. Mi trovo in questo posto perchè su 4chan, anche li, sono arrivati i ragazzini troppo edgy, troppo ""anonymouse is legione!"", che si ritrovano nelle chat java di yahoo per organizzare il loro prossimo attacco. Certo. Cerca ""anonymous italia"" su google. Dei veri hacktivisti, col loro forumetto su forumfree, il twitter, il gruppo di facebook. Poi ci sono quelli che si sentono pro, che magari hanno comprato una manciata di gigabyte di spazio per il loro forum segreto non indicizzato con password esadecimale a domanda segreta, in cui orfganizzare una gara di automasturbazione dicendo ""HO BUCATO QUESTA PASSWORD SONO PROPRIO FIGO VERO AN ON EE MOOOSE"". E si dimenticano la base, il core, il nocciolo, il nucleo. The Lulz. Whatever anon does, he does it for the lulz. non vendetta o giustizia sociale; solo per una risata. Una risata ci seppellirà, e a volte temo che quella che doveva seppellirci sia in ritardo di un bel pò.

The EU allows for VAT refunds. The process varies between countries, but you generally get a form stamped at customs on your way out of the country, then mail it back to your vendor for a tax refund. IIRC, they have this too in Canada, Thailand, and other countries; The US has been behind on this, but that's probably partially complicated by every state and many cities levying their own sales taxes.

That said, the majority of tax evasion has nothing to do sales taxes. Most simple tax evasion occurs with the underreporting of income, or an exaggeration of deductions. More complex tax evasion schemes involve setting up special purpose entities (SPEs) or shell corporations to launder money.

On a side note, one point that you're almost getting at is the taxation of foreign-earned income as it is earned (rather when it is spent). A lot of Americans are giving up citizenship because every dollar they earn over ~$95k is subject to the US income tax in addition to whatever they pay in their country. That's the double-taxation; they don't get double-taxation on sales taxes. That is pretty ridiculous, but it's not really worth bringing into a conversation on tax evasion because only a small percentage of expatriates, who are already only ~1% of the US population, earn significantly over $95k/year.

The swiss dislike us because we are one of the largest groups of immigrants ( we are pretty much to the Swiss what the Turks are to us).

- Not enough helicopters. NH90 are starting to be delivered, there's a common training school in Czech Republic I think now.

- Not enough airlifting. A400M are soon to enter service and there's a European Air Transport Center now. I think the UK has also bought some C17 recently and are open to pooling their use.

- Not enough air tankers. The UK is supposed to renew its fleet soon and France has suggested pooling resources. Even though it was rejected by the US, EADS has shown it now has the capacity to built it based on the A330.

- No enough drones. The UK and France just signed an agreement to cooperate on both surveillance and attack drones in the coming years, especially through BAe and Dassault. On a related note there's a common satellite center in Spain and a cooperation program to extend or renew satellite communications capabilities.

Basically, there's a renewed interest for everything done by the [European Defense Agency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Defence_Agency).

It varies depending on the kind of career the aspirant wants to start and it's different in every Bundesland (state), as most of the police is organized at state level. If you want to become a ""normal"" cop, you are required to be young, healthy, at least 165cm tall and pass a number of intelligence, fitness, character and knowledge tests. You also need to have the ""Mittlere Reife"", which is comparable to the American High School graduation. The ""Fachhochschulreife"" (meaning at least 12 years of school) is required if you want to study and start a career with much better opportunities. The latter usually takes three years, while normal police training takes two and a half years.

&gt; We often hear of corruption, and lack of accountability among US cops, does this exist in Germany? 

There is corruption, of course. I've heard stories of illegal immigrants who routinely bribe police officers when their identity is checked. But it's not as bad as it sounds. Transparency International gave Germany an 8.0 out of 10 in 2011, which places it at number 14 worldwide. The US gets a 7.1, ranking 24th worldwide. Now this score incorporates all sorts of things, not just police corruption, but it's still a very good indicator.
Accountability is always an issue, but generally German cops use guns [very rarely](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/05/german-police-used-only-85-bullets-against-people-2011/52162/) against people. Gun usage by police always causes a massive uproar in the media and means a lot of paperwork for the officers involved. There was a case of a student who was shot in the back multiple times by police a few years ago, which was followed by a very uncritical trial, so as always, there are exceptions to the rule.

&gt; Do they receive slap on the wrist punishments for misconduct?

If an officers is accused of misbehavior, the investigation is usually carried out by a different office in order to increase objectivity. ""Slaps on the wrists"" still happen much too often, many trials against violent cops are abandoned or the verdicts are not very harsh. I think the situation is improving as the public is growing more and more critical of such practices, but there is much room for improvement. My personal impression is that the situation is better than in most parts of the world, including the US, but especially the Northern European countries are far ahead.

&gt; Does the public trust them?

Generally very much. ""Die Polizei, dein Freund und Helfer"" (The police, your friend and aide) is an old, but still very popular slogan and a great summary of the image the general public has of the police. Police officers are very respected, although younger people tend to like them a bit less than older ones. The excellent image has its cracks here and there, but overall the public trusts the police, yes.

&gt; Are they courteous, or cold? 

Depends. Foreigners and members of ethnic minorities are definitely treated worse than Germans, although there is almost no open discrimination and minorities are heavily encouraged to join the police. Your usual patrolman is most likely a nice guy, but expect members of the riot police, border patrol and SEK (SWAT equivalent) to be of the colder and more pushy kind.",0,1343538540,null,0,false,0,c5l01qm,t3_xbuv0,t1_c5l01qm,t3_xbuv0,null,1429497383,25,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,25

You can make the tax for rich people and corporations 90% if you want, but they will find ways not to pay it the same as if it's only 10%. The rate is irrelevant. Corporations especially. They're profit-driven. Every penny paid in tax is a penny less paid to shareholders. They'd say 0.01% is too high of a tax rate. There is no tax rate that is compatible with the fiduciary duty of corporations to make money at all costs.

Whatever you think is the right rate...30%, 50%, 40%, I don't know - collecting it through corporate profits and income taxes is complicated, full of loopholes and impossible to do/track down with the internationality of the world we live in.

It's far better to just tax people on their property where they live or on the commerce they do on a daily basis. Even though it's regressive, you can give rebates to the poorer people that way.

If we all paid a simple 25% tax on every transaction and 5% yearly on our property, we'd still end up with the same kind of taxation, except it would be far simpler to administer. Even though sales tax advocates are wrong in that it's regressive, they're right in it's simplicity. 

All you need are slight tweaks. And I don't really care if some poor people are defrauding us because they don't make a difference compared to a millionaire on up defrauding us. So maybe some poor people won't collect taxes on some transactions or might fudge their situation to get a better rebate. I don't care.

I turned around to see if they ment me. The only thing i had with me was a small messenger bag. I had a waterbottle, a book, and some small things in there. And these cops, noticing that i was in a real hurry, asked me: ""Papiere, und in deine Tasche wollen wir auch sehen, hast du Drogen dabei?"" (asked to hand over ID and let my bag be searched for drugs) you could see how they took their time, opened every little zipper, and then they asked me: ""oh, you in a hurry, mh, looks like you're gonna miss your train, what a pity""

The car toll? You pay CHF 40.- to use all the autobahns (and tunnels!) for a year. Compare that to using the private french ones, or the price you pay to use the bridges in Danemark. We payed for the gotthard tunnels (road and the new train), we're never going to get back the billions we invested with the little we get from the taxes. You're welcome.

The benefits from the EU, yes, we get some of those. But did you know we also throw money in the pot for the ""massive eastern european infrastructure upgrade project""? Again, billions. There was even a vote on this a few years ago, because the conservatives didn't like to give away money, but we said yes at the ballot box.

And we said yes to the Freizügigkeitsabkommen (for non germans: free movement of persons among EU memberstates, including the right to live and work in foreign countires). So now it's even easier to attract brains. But is that our fault? Could we attract people if we didn't already have something they didn't, and something interresting to work on?  
I think no. We know how to build infrastructure ourselfes, and we have many small companies that do high tech/very specific/high quality stuff (I did a Schnupperlehre once in the company that builds the satelite communication system that is used in all swiss embassies. They are hard to jam, during the war in kosovo/serbia the swiss embassy was the only one that still had an independent link to the outside world. That company employed less than 20 people. There are many examples like this).  
Because for decades, the only real ressource switzerland has that has any value internationaly is the *people*. Education, and a secure environment. And our schools make shure we know that by the time we are 10.

Brain drain is a *much* bigger problem for semi-industrial nations, south america, the arab world, etc. It's a real problem for them. Yes some germans now live and work in switzerland. Meanwhile, Germany is a much bigger target for brains around the world. So, are you a parasite? 

The rules of the game suck, Switzerland isn't worse than most western nations. 

edit: The way you describle germans and the way we percieve them is harsher than I would dare to say, but, yeah, that pretty much summs it up.

Those Albanians already have a national country, called Albania. It borders on Serbia. If the Albanians in Serbia didnt like living in Serbia, they could have left Serbia, Albania is just a stone's throw away.

Instead of that, the NATO cut off a part of serbia, and gave it to neighboring Albania, so Kosovar Albanians can live in albania instead of serbia.

Before the Serb-Albanian conflict, the Serbs similarly tried to cut off a part of Croatia. Croatians didnt like a third of their country being violently taken away and simply chased away the attacking serbs back to serbia. And Croatia was allowed to clean itself from 200,000 Serbs to restore its territorial integrity.

This is how Serbia should have been allowed to treat the Albanian attackers: Either recognize the serbian state or GTFO back to Albanistan.

Why is it hard? Mostly it is because every conservative party in existence needs a scapegoat faction of people to prove they are ""good for the original citizens"". In the us, it's ""illegal immigrants"", and in Germany it's alternating between people on social welfare and foreigners (which naturally include asylum-seekers). In fact, when we had massive Neo-Nazi ... [Well, it was as close to a progrom than you can get against asylum-seekers in 1992](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_of_Rostock-Lichtenhagen), politicians choose not to persecute the nazis (who actually tried burning the asylum home in the presence of police officers), no, they choose to change the Grundgesetz, our version of a constitution, so that it is almost impossible to achieve asylum status to begin with (for instance, you may only apply if you have come directly from an unsafe state, which rules out any other transport than aircraft).

Then, even if you have the asylum status, you are forced to be resident in one of the towns you have been assigned to, and to the flat you have been assigned to (which is in many cases contrary to what we think of human dignity). You may not work for the first year and live in a shithole. Many townships do not care about your situation, your kids might get schooled, but that's about it (and thou there is a duty for kids to go to school, more often than not, this duty is not enforced in asylum-seekers, thus only adding to the circle of no social contacts and litte to no learned language skills).

Naturalization is by design very, very difficult, and nowadays forces citizens-to-be to pass a test that is difficult even for born Germans. The test does demand -and that is a good thing, IMHO - language skills, but lessons are not paid beforehand and are too expensive to be taken from the 250€ of asylgeld (of which only about a hundred are actually paid in money, depending on the town you are being assigned to). The process itself only is possible after several years of residence (in your case: after a few years living with cockroaches in your Asylheim)

So, let's assume that you passed the test and now officially are a German citizen. You got a diploma as an animal doctor in your home country. Let's find a job, shall we? Turns out the best you can do is delivery driver because based on some arcane rules, we refuse to accept your diploma being worth more than toilet paper.

So, after a decade of fearing every night some bureaucrat deciding you no longer are worthy of asylum and sending the cops to fly you back at night to your homecountry, eventually directly to the gallows, after living in conditions unsanitary and unhealthy, you are even with a great education worth little more than an unlearned worker.

Oh, I forgot. Now, your skin color has not changed, has it? Welcome to this nice little thing Germans have still overwhelmingly: *open racism*. You might have a german passport, but you will be the Ausländer forever, no matter how good you do your job, you will be the whipping boy for any bullshit the politicans and/or the population will need an explanation for - and did I mention our Neo-Nazis?

My solution: Let them work and reside as free people from the very start. Ask them the moment they set foot on our turf if they plan to return eventually (giving them other choices) or if they want to be naturalized (which returns in freedom of residence and a german language boot camp so they can function). Give them a chance to let them have their diplomas evaluated on a fair basis, and if they don't pass that evaluation, give them a chance to have some kind of ""prop-up course"".

You are going to far here when invoking morality. Should, for example, the saudi government be given all information it demands on citizens that live in some european country? We can't just wiretap our citizens, but the saudi government may be able to do that to citizens in their own country. So, when they ask us to do it to a saudi citizen in our country, should we comply?

An example more related to the topic would be a russian citizen, maybe he's a jurnalist, that has his cash on swiss bank accounts because his government is a little authoritarian, and gives jurnalists a hard time. That way, in case they crack down on him, he might be lucky, might not be imprisoned imediatly, he has some founds outside the country he can use to gtfo. Or maybe his family, at least, if he's not so lucky.  
Should we give information about this person to the russian government too?

As other people on this thread already noted, it's an issue of neutrality. I could easily argue that, because of examples like the above, banks have the moral *obligation* to withhold information about customers. There is value in privacy.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; You are going to far here when invoking morality. Should, for example, the saudi government be given all information it demands on citizens that live in some european country? We can't just wiretap our citizens, but the saudi government may be able to do that to citizens in their own country. So, when they ask us to do it to a saudi citizen in our country, should we comply?

Totally different case. In case of Swiss banking secrecy we are talking about people that are not citizen of Switzerland nor are they residents there.

&gt; An example more related to the topic would be a russian citizen, maybe he's a jurnalist, that has his cash on swiss bank accounts because his government is a little authoritarian, and gives jurnalists a hard time. That way, in case they crack down on him, he might be lucky, might not be imprisoned imediatly, he has some founds outside the country he can use to gtfo. Or maybe his family, at least, if he's not so lucky.
Should we give information about this person to the russian government too?

Both the EU with its member states and the USA are stable and strong democracies that respect human rights. 

&gt; As other people on this thread already noted, it's an issue of neutrality. I could easily argue that, because of examples like the above, banks have the moral obligation to withhold information about customers. There is value in privacy.

No they don't. Banks are corporations whose function are sanctioned and regulated by the state. If activities that banks engage are against national interests, then those activities need to be changed.

&gt; Of course, this can also be exploited. It's an imperfect world. But we can do things about it without just giving access to all that data. Like with the withholding tax. That pretty much fixes the problems of tax evasions in most cases.

I'm sorry, but your answers have only made me more aggravated. I do hope that in the future EU will use all its power to crush not only Swiss banks, but also the larger Swiss economy with all means possible, for example denouncing EU-Swiss trade deals. You shouldn't be too unhappy about this, because the EU would after all just be protecting its citizens by from financial criminality.",0,1343594659,null,0,false,0,c5l8tb8,t3_xaq47,t1_c5l8tb8,t1_c5l7pmu,null,1429501574,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Jaguar, Typhoon, Rafale, Gripen are either failure at european cooperation or came into existence because one country decided it could do better by itself. It's a shame since we have such a great aerospace industry. But indeed it's such a source of pride that nobody is willing to seem inferior to the others. And in the end we still have country choosing F16, F18 or JSF even when it's not what they need or when it costs more.

This is exactly what I want to see solved. Exactly it. I think the Rafale is the prime example of this. I'm sure it does somethings better than the Typhoon.. but in reality it has cost Europe billions in wasted development and lost sales. 

&gt;Currently what we actually lack much are helicopters, drones, tankers and air transport. It's all being worked on currently with completely new programs (for instance the French and British are starting to cooperate on drones) or by pooling existing resources and procurement (for instance with the A400M or future tankers).

Hopefully we will see more of this but with less room for countries to back out and design their own class. Even things like ATVs need to be worked on together.

true,flyingorange,VOJV,Vojvodina,"Fine, here's the official Turkish statistics from 1911:

http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/kosovo/chap2.htm

&gt; According to Turkish statistics, 912,902 inhabitants lived in the Vilayet of Kosova, out of whom 743,040 were Albanians, 53,396 Bulgarians, 106,209 Serbs, 20,009 Jews and 5,043 Romanies.

Of course, Serb historians attacked this official data as well because they didn't count women (though I can't see how counting them would favor the monogamous Christians), so here are some other estimates as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_Vilayet#Demographics

&gt; British journalist H. Brailsford estimated in 1906 that two-thirds of the population of Kosovo was Albanian and one-third Serbian. The most populous western districts of Đakovica and Peć were said to have between 20,000 and 25,000 Albanian households, as against some 5,000 Serbian ones. A map of Alfred Stead, published in 1909, shows that similar numbers of Serbs and Albanians were living in the territory.

&gt; A publication from December 21, 1912 in the Belgian magazine Ons Volk Ontwaakt (Our Nation Awakes) estimated 827,100 inhabitants:
&gt;
&gt;    Muslim Albanians - 418,000
&gt;
&gt;    Christian Bulgarians - 250,000
&gt;
&gt;    Orthodox Serbs - 113,000
&gt;
&gt;    Mixed - 22,000

Considering the borders are open and one could just as easily live here or there, not much would change from a de facto union. :P

We haven't been at war for some 200 years and we have a very similar history - the Romans, the barbaric invasions, the Moors, the Reconquista, the discoveries and the colonization of the New World, the fall of the Empire, the instability in the early XX century with our Republican Revolution and your Civil War over the Monarchy, the dictatorial regimes with WW2 neutrality and now the EU. Even the language is quite similar. :P

We'll never be the same and I personally don't think an Iberian Union on its own will happen, if there's a stronger Union, it will be inside the EU.

true,CardCarryingOctopus,null,null,"The big problem is that, while the challenges that the monetary union presents are highly visibly, it is a lot more difficult to quantify the advantages.

The German population is being supplied with a pretty steady stream of doom-and-gloom scenarios, peppered with the occasional notice that, ostensibly, only they will have to pay even more money to nations that have suffered from reckless economic policies. 

The effect is twofold: the constant barrage of ""Collapse is inevitable, ZOMG!!!"" type news tends to lessen the message. After all, you can only hear terrible news so long before your senses are dulled. In addition, it makes the problem seem much less severe; After all Greece ain't broke yet, which we've been warned about for what, a couple of years now? This then also leads to to those fun statements from those nimrods Rösler and Seehofer that Greece leaving isn't scary anymore.

On the other side, the semi-regular news that Greece/Spain/Portugal/Ireland/etc. will need more cash is not really endearing the entire Project Europe to the general population. Rightly or wrongly they feel that they will be footing the bill for their neighbors who have been fucking around with their books, while Germany actually had to endure some pretty painful regulation changes. Remember how Germany was the ""Sick Man of Europe"" before the Agenda 2010 and Hartz IV reforms began to get traction? Yeah, well a lot of people still have that in the back of their mind and their reaction to the PIGS is along the lines of ""We did it, we're fine. Why aren't you doing this, you lazy bastard?""

All in all, nobody ever took the time and effort to adequately tell the Germans why the EU (and the monetary union) was a good idea. A sizeable part of the population hated the idea of giving up the Deutschmark in the first place and that bitterness and fear was never really assuaged by, well, anybody. Couple that with the fact that the advantages are difficult to convey. After all, it is more difficult to wade through meters of economic data sheets and say: ""European integration helped the German economy grow by blah% on average in blah and blah area"" than it is to point at the government and shout: ""Look, those lazy Greeks are getting even more billions of our money!"", while completely ignoring all macroeconomic implications.

The EU is a huge complex behemoth, the fiscal policies even more so. To distill this into a succinct message understandable for the general population is a fool's errand. Yet it is highly necessary in order to gain wide-range support. The Euro needs a good, charismatic ""Explainer-in-Chief"", but who's willing to step up to the plate?

&gt; In the 1980 United States Census, over 49 million (49,598,035) Americans claimed English ancestry, at the time around 26.34% of the total population and largest reported group which, even today, would make them the largest ethnic group in the United States.[12][13]. This outnumbered the population of England at the time.

and:

&gt; In the 2000 census, 24.5 million Americans reported English ancestry, 8.7% of the total U.S. population. This estimate is probably a serious undercount by over 30 million given that, in the 1980 census, around 50 million citizens claimed to be of at least partial English ancestry. In 1980, 23,748,772 Americans claimed wholly English ancestry and another 25,849,263 claimed English along with another ethnic ancestry.[28]

I think along the centuries we develop a deep distrust of anything Spaniard, and I don't think it will go very soon.

&gt;Eine neunköpfige Ermittlergruppe – das entspricht ungefähr der Personalstärke in einem ungeklärten Mordfall – wurde eingesetzt. Einzige Aufgabe: Facebook-Nutzer zu ermitteln, die online Interesse an einer für morgen angekündigten Party in Backnang bekundet haben.

&gt;Während die Beamten “mit Hochdruck” Facebook-Identitäten ermitteln, schwärmen andere Polizisten aus, um bereits Identifizierte aufzusuchen. 130 Bürger, mutmaßlich meist junge Menschen, hat es nach Angaben der Polizei bereits getroffen. Sie erhielten keineswegs Mails oder einen Brief. Sie wurden auch nicht angerufen. Nein, die Polizeibeamten suchten sie auf. Und zwar nicht nur zu Hause, sondern auch an der Schule, der Uni oder dem Arbeitsplatz.

Gehts noch? Sowas dient einzig und allein der Einschüchterung. Aus welchem Grund? Weil man bei Facebook auf ""Ich nehme teil"" geklickt hat? Wo ist denn da die Verhältnismäßigkeit gegeben? Und so ein Klick muss noch nichtmal bedeuten das die Person wirklich teilnehmen wollte. Wie oft stimmen denn schon die vorher erhobenen FB-Teilnahmezahlen mit den realen Zahlen überein?

&gt;Die Teilnehmer an einer verbotenen Facebook-Party müssen mit Personenfeststellungen, erkennungsdienstlichen Maßnahmen, Platzverweisen, Bußgeldern und weiteren Kosten rechnen. Jugendliche werden an ihre Eltern überstellt.

&gt;Am Freitagmittag und Abend werden vier Bereitschaftsrichter im Dienst sein, um gegenüber völlig uneinsichtigen Personen schnell und effektiv Entscheidungen zur Gewahrsamnahme treffen zu können. Auch die Stuttgarter Staatsanwaltschaft ist erreichbar, damit strafprozessuale Maßnahmen, wie Durchsuchungen und Beschlagnahmen schnell durchgeführt werden können.

Man könnte meinen die hätten nicht zu einer Party sondern zu ""fackeln wir die Stadt ab"" aufgerufen...Durchsuchungen? Ich hoffe die meinen damit nicht Hausdurchsuchungen.. Was auch immer die hoffen an Beweismitteln dort zu finden. oO

true,[deleted],null,null,"Actually it is the other way around. Several decades ago problematic, now better.

""Sweden has had a unique economic model in the post-World War II era, characterized by close cooperation between the government, labour unions and corporations. The Swedish economy has extensive and universal social benefits funded by high taxes, close to 50% of GDP.[11] In the 1980s, a real estate and financial bubble formed, driven by a rapid increase in lending. A restructuring of the tax system, in order to emphasize low inflation combined with an international economic slowdown in the early 1990s, caused the bubble to burst. **Between 1990 and 1993 GDP went down by 5% and unemployment skyrocketed, causing the worst economic crisis in Sweden since the 1930s.** According to an analysis by George Berglund published in Computer Sweden in 1992, the investment level decreased drastically for information technology and computing equipment, except in the financial and banking sector, the part of the industry that created the crisis.[12] The investment levels for IT and computers were restored as early as 1993.[13] In 1992 there was a run on the currency, the central bank briefly jacking up interest to 500% in an unsuccessful effort to defend the currency's fixed exchange rate.[14] Total employment fell by almost 10% during the crisis.
A real estate boom ended in a bust. The government took over nearly a quarter of banking assets at a cost of about 4% of the nation's GDP. This was known colloquially as the ""Stockholm Solution"". The United States Federal Reserve remarked in 2007, that ""In the early 1970s, Sweden had one of the highest income levels in Europe; today, its lead has all but disappeared... So, even well-managed financial crises don't really have a happy ending.""[15]
The welfare system that had been growing rapidly since the 1970s could not be sustained with a falling GDP, lower employment and larger welfare payments. In 1994 the government budget deficit exceeded 15% of GDP. **The response of the government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden's competitiveness. When the international economic outlook improved combined with a rapid growth in the IT sector, which Sweden was well positioned to capitalize on, the country was able to emerge from the crisis.[16]
The crisis of the 1990s was by some viewed as the end of the much buzzed welfare model called ""Svenska modellen"", literally ""The Swedish Model"", as it proved that governmental spending at the levels previously experienced in Sweden was not long term sustainable in a global open economy.[17] Much of the Swedish Model's acclaimed advantages actually had to be viewed as a result of the post WWII special situation, which left Sweden untouched when competitors' economies were comparatively weak.[18]""**

You are proposing that a decision to take away a good part of people's earnings (with violence if need be) can be justified by a simple majority vote (which probably didn't happen), even if some people prefer to spend the money elsewhere than to sink it into government projects.

Whether the state's democratic apparatus works well enough is debatable, but for now it's all we've got. There has been decided on a tax level of a certain magnitude, which is being avoided by some citizens of the state. Your libertarian inspired idée-fixe that taxes are a violent form of theft by an abstract unknown evil entity is completely seperated from all political theory that is considered to have intellectual value.

&gt; And on top of that, if the majority of another country decides to have lower taxes than the majority of your country (or any high-tax country) you would see no problem in pressuring those people, even by withholding necessary resources like water, which are paid for by the consumers voluntarily, to compliance. Imo that's disgusting.

If you would read what I wrote in my first post and my second reply to you, it will be clear that I completely respect all decisions the population of other countries made about their tax system of choice, be it very low or very high. I however do not accept that the globalized nature of capital makes it possible that the democratically decided tax system of some countries is not being respected because other countries take advantage of the situation by designing systems that facilitate tax evasion. While I find these acts as dispicable as the next guy I have not proposed hostile military or economic actions. I only claimed that it has happened in history with a desired effect, which answered OP's question. 

But it's my opinion that we can't eradicate this problem by threats directed towards the 'bad' countries. Only with an international effort can we tackle this problem. The only action I proposed that could be considered hostile, was stopping the movement of capital from or to countries that refuse to cooperate merely with the supply of financial information.

Where as the same ideas presented to a team made up of Brits, French, Germans, and ex-soviets will almost always focus on what could go wrong with the idea and previous failures which might be related. 

In addition to this there is also a very strong divide between academic study, or learning purely for the joy of learning, and making money. In talks about the British university system over in /r/ukpolitics the view that it's somehow distasteful for a university to sully itself with the business of making money has quite often come up. It's not the done thing and it will just ruin the purity of academic study. I could well be wrong but I suspect this might be a cultural hang over from an age where most academic research was conducted by churches in one form or another, or alternatively some utopian socialist crap from the 60's.

Having a weak national currency doesn't go against the free market, it's the same as a employee selling his services for a lower price than someone more experienced. Right now a weaker currency would help us get to a point where we could compete on the same level with the Germans.

I'm English and have lived in Montpellier and Nice, both are excellent. For learning French I would say Montpellier is better. 

While the immediate surrounds of Nice are awesome (Cannes, St Tropez, Antibes, Villefrenche Sur Mer, Eze, Cap d'Ail, Cap ferrat, Monaco, etc) are all within easy reach, so it's probably the best place to base yourself to visit the jet set of France. It's pretty special. That being said, Nice town centre isn't actually that nice. As a non French speaker I actually found it to be a little hostile. So it's probably the place to be if you want to visit some beaches, but maybe not to learn french. Plus, the rent is still very expensive.

Montepellier is much smaller, but I love it. The town is super old with some pretty impressive buildings (the church and the medical school are awesome). So why is Montpellier better for learning French? The city has one of the highest percentages of students in France. I think they have three fairly substantial universities all in what is essentially a fairly small city. That means there are lots of young people eager to learn English and more than happy to help with your French. I found a group of friends really easily and got lots of invites to parties. Furthermore, Montpellier has a really active couch surfing community. They used to set up weekly polygot meetings which easily used to get 15-30 people. Each table was assigned a different language with a mixture of native and non-native speakers. The rent is much cheaper and because there are so many students there's lots of flat sharing opportunities.

The only downside is that you'll be confined to the city centre as the surrounding isn't particularly nice, and if you don't have a car it is difficult to visit the beach or le grande motte. However, the city centre is sooo nice to just walk around, have a coffee, sit and watch people go by. There's lots of international people there as well as they have a number of language schools.

I absolutely agree that the virtues of the EU are often extolled by pro-Union politicians/economists/etc. and the fact remains that the net-benefits exceed the drawbacks for Germany (at the moment).

Where the proponents have failed however is explaining why the EU is beneficial for the average German citizen. Quoting export statistics and growth figures is of course a good starting point, but most will rather point at internal factors (""German Engineering"", efficiency, the Mittelstand,etc.) i.e. factors that can be controlled from within. The beneficial impact of the monetary union is often overlooked because politicans have not **adequately** explained its positive effect on the economy.

When the Euro was introduced it was dubbed the ""Teuro"" (Teuer [expensive] + Euro) due to the perceived price increases in consumer goods. I would argue that this negative legacy has colored the currency debate in Germany in a lasting way, if only to instill a predisposition of being critical of the Euro.

All in all, as the crisis still seems far away for us, most people probably think something like this: 'Germany's doing a good job demanding stricter policies in the south, that's good, but it's not like it really matters what we think since we're a country of 5 million and the parliament will approve everything that comes out of Brussels, good or bad.'

&gt; Ιmages of Chancellor Merkel with a grim facial expression now appear almost every day on the cover pages of Greek newspapers. The caricatures depicting her as a sharp-toothed bloodsucker or as a strict schoolmaster with a raised index finger seem almost benign compared to the harsher depictions of her wielding a leather whip and wearing a Swastika armband.

The frontpages of major and minor newspapers with national circulation (all you can eat: from serious ones to gossipists, nationalists, communists, and plain nuts) for the day of Spiegel's article's publication are here:

http://news247.gr/newspapers/?dtmDate=2012-02-29

Change the dates and see for yourself. This is not a daily phenomenon. A fringe newspaper did what is described in the article. If I remember correctly, one or two other fringe newspapers with equally low circulation had offensive or borderline offensive caricatures in their frontpages. As for inside pages, Europe is not the Middle East. Some cartoonists and columnists mentioned in the article, draw or write worse things about Greeks.

The whole saga started after Focus had the brilliant idea of depicting Aphrodite giving the middle finger salute. Imagine a Greek magazine depicting the (German) Pope giving the same salute. Neither Greeks, nor Germans could swallow this (pun intended).
