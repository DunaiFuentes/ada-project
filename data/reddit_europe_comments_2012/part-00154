true,MistShinobi,null,null,"I think that Spaniards may sometimes show certain predjudices but most of the time it is all just talking and not real feelings. I think that a very significant portion of the population is open to change their misconceptions once they meet someone that challenges them. I can recall many people that changed their ideas about other ethnicities, nationalities or groups (e.g. homosexuals) once they get the chance to interact with some actual people and realize that they are simply people.

A significant portion of the Chinese community in Spain works in small family-owned businesses in very hard conditions or, at least, harder conditions than most other workers. This has lead to a negative sterotype that doesn't necessarily portrays the reality of most chinese immigrants. The stereotypical Chinese works long hours at those businesses, and starts his own as soon as he finds a chance. He won't take loans as he borrows money from family and friends and will never, ever, have enough. He will never stop and enjoy his money buying luxury cars or beach houses (highly supicious behaviour to Spanish eyes). He will use the benefits to open new businesses and will hire few to none Spaniards. It is known that there is a never-ending supply of relatives in China to provide workforce for the new businesses. These freshly imported relatives will start the cycle all over again. All of them will operate almost exclusively with cash, in order to avoid taxes and secretly send profit money to China. Spanish rules and regulations are irrelevant and they will be bypassed or ignored as much as possible. Work, work, work and work. Make more and more money, die and send your corpse back to China. This is only a stereotype but the truth is that the Chinese community is a big stranger for the average Spaniard.

However, as years pass and they raise their families in Spain, younger generations get to hang out with them at school and later at universities. The presence of Chinese students in Spanish campuses in growing enormously and now I hear my younger brother say things like: ""... I was in this party with my friend Li when..."".

Chinese culture is hardly known in Spain unless you consider fake chinese food and Jackie Chan, Chinese culture. However, the idea that we are shifting to a China dominated economy is quickly spreading. This has increased the interest in Chinese culture and made Mandarin a very popular language. In the last couple of years, Mandarin Academies are popping everywhere. Honestly,  I can really see a growing market for Chinese au-pairs in high-class famillies from bigger cities.

On English... well, most young people will be able to mantain some kind of basic communication, but the average Spaniard struggles to mantain a fluent conversation in English, even university students.

So why can they claim Samuel? Because they live on the territory that used to be Bulgaria? Not even that! Since Bulgaria used to be a bit more to the west, so technically the Macedonians have more right to the name than the Bulgarians. What we should do is the Bulgarians and the Macedonians should swap names, then it'll be like on [this map from 1045](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Byzantine_Macedonia_1045CE.svg&amp;page=1).

So it's really more like, some people that lived on the territory that is today Bulgaria, revolted some time in the 19th century, they didn't know what else to call themselves so they grabbed the name ""Bulgaria"", and with it claimed some history as their own. That does not mean they have ownership over that history, only that they claim it.

And since it seems to be impossible to have ownership of history at all, I think there is no such a thing, and everyone can claim whatever they want.",0,1352060336,null,0,1352060660,0,c6wcm3b,t3_12ly4f,t1_c6wcm3b,t1_c6wasom,null,1430318903,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Macedonia is a country that exists for less than 50 years is overrun with Albanians and has a native population of Bulgarians /mostly/.

The problem that Bulgaria is facing is that Macedonia continuously lead a anti-Bulgaria propaganda campaign including taking our national heroes, demolishing Bulgarian national monuments **and in a scandal case not allowing access to Bulgarian citizens to pay their respects to their predecessors who were killed in WW1 WW2 and the Balkan war.** Bulgaria has no interest in Macedonia's territory nor the people with Macedonian citizenship. Most people native to that land have issued Bulgarian passports /the biggest boom being between 2004 - 2008/. 

Greece has a problem with Macedonia claiming that they are directly connected to Alexander the great and all of Greece is rightfully theirs. Can't go in details about Greece - not sufficient information.

Serbia's big problem with Macedonia is that the territory was taken from Yugoslavia /before the total break/ and under the power of the Great Forces /USA, England and Russia/ forcefully introduced as a independent republic. Bulgaria's recognition of the republic did not help the relations between Serbia and Bulgaria.


Overall the whole Balkan story is a highly manipulated scenario. Everything that happens on the Balkans happens for a reason. The geographical spot is too valuable for the great forces and a strong united country or number of countries cannot be allowed to occupy it. As long as all countries are fighting each other and the situation is unstable the control over the territory continues. 

**In the whole modern history of the Balkans till now only the Serbians  /in the form of Yugoslavia/ were close to creating some unity. And when they tried to preserve it, and showed some will and opposition against the Great Forces, America decided to bomb Beograd /capital city/.**

true,Oda_Krell,EURO,"German, living in the Netherlands","As much as I respect barsoap's opinion on r/europe usually, I have to disagree this time:

The NSU murders have revealed a number of things, in my opinion: a) a deep-rooted inefficieny of the national investigation agencies, and possibly a political bias in that they didn't take ultaright/fascist crimes as serious as ultraleft crimes, and b) a xenophobic attitude by parts of society and the media, who seem think of crimes where immigrants are the victims as automatically being an ""inside job"" commited by other immigrants (the infamous ""Doenermorde"" term is evidence for this).

As disturbing as those two observations are, I don't think they're reason enought to entirely disband the agencies that were responsible: keep in mind, it's not that the agencies were responsible for the crimes itself (in which case I would fully support disbanding them), they were, possibly systematically, somewhat blind to ultraright crimes -- with the current pressure by the media, the public and many politicians, I think there is a good chance this bias will be countered and corrected.

About the 2nd observation, the underlying racism in society: I do think Germany still has a long way to go in this respect. Large parts of society, even otherwise reasonable people, still have the notion of ""German-ness"" as being linked to ethnicity, i.e. they reject, for example, Turks/descendants of Turkish immigrants as full German citizens because they're not ""Germanic"" (based on some vague, usually only half-understood, genetic definition of ""German-ness"").

Now, I'm not excusing this way of thinking, but I believe the only way to change this belief is that we (i.e. those who already left behind the notion of ""ethnic German-ness"") convince the rest of Germany that a non-ethnic definition is more productive, and to provide arguments for this (e.g. changing age structure of Germany, integration across Europe, genetic definition based on outdated/wrong science). 

So in conclusion, while I can see how the NSU murders can make Turkish Germans feel very uncomfortable, maybe even scared, I would also plead to see it in perspective: I don't think Turkish people are, by and large, at risk in Germany (with some exceptions perhaps, such as some rural parts of East Germany where Neonazi gangs are largely unchecked). I'm not saying the situation in Germany is just peachy and you shouldn't complain, but I also think it's not quite as bleak as some paint it either.

Like azoq suggest I recommand you to spend maybe 5 days in Paris and then visit 2 or 3 places, it should be more enjoyable, from my point of view.

So, if you want a medieval and Celtic touch try [Saint-Malo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Malo) then [Finistère](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finistere) : [Crozon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crozon) : [Concarneau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concarneau), [Douarnenez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douarnenez), etc. Lots of small medieval sailor's town, nice food, nice landscape ; it should be cheap but you absolutely need a car.

For a more romantic trip go straight for the postcard : [the Loire valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loire_Valley) full of Renaissance castle : [Chambord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Château_de_Chambord), [Chenonceau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenonceau), [Azay-le-Rideau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Château_d%27Azay-le-Rideau), etc. Nice castles and towns, good food and wine, but you also need a car.

Second option : [Sarlat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarlat) in [Périgord noir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perigord), again very nice food (duck and foie gras), wines and very typical town, with lots of small village around in the same mood. A little more expensive in summer but not so much in this season.

Or maybe [la Normandie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy) with [Honfleur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honfleur) and [Etretat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etretat), love it, not expensive at all and closer to Paris, but I never try in November and it could be cold — forget bicycle…

For single cities : [Lille](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille), near Belgium, is very nice, and [Lyon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon) too. I am not fan of [Marseille](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille) but the near towns of [Aix-en-Provence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aix_en_provence), [Manosque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosque) and [Nîme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimes) are really nice and the weather should be the best here in these days.

The facetious comment was because on a fairly large article, you honed in directly on the one paragraph that wasn't relevant. Given most of the article concerns modern ways of avoiding tax, either you deliberately avoided mentioning them (and are still pretending they don't exist) - hence facetious - or you just didn't see them because you didn't read the article.

So, for the avoidance of doubts; specific examples:

[Moving offshore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_avoidance#Country_of_residence) (for tax purposes only), [creating separate legal entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_avoidance#Legal_entities) (to control your money, but with lower tax liabilities), [taking advantage of uncertainty in the law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_avoidance#Legal_vagueness) to fiddle expenses etc., [using investments particularly designed to minimise tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_avoidance#Tax_shelters).

And  we've established, we aren't talking about illegality here. Do you want companies to abide by the law as defined by the courts; or by what you claim you can discern by mysterious means to have been the legislators' intent?

They are also in support of widespread home ownership.

Distributist philosophy has a  certain history in the British commonwealth, you could say that ""egalitarian conservatives"" or ""Red Tories"" are usually Distributists, as it makes it possible to be egalitarian without being pro-big-government and with still respecting the private-property system.

It got a bit of popularity in the recent years in Britain after Ferdinand Mount published a book Mind the Gap. Mount and his circle can be said to belong to this kind of ""egalitarian conservatives"", ""Red Tories"", so an an alternative, non-mainstream Tory stream, I think of their most popular ideas is giving council-owned houses to their tenants as actually a private property, I think one of the slogans of that books was ""Why should either the council or the Earl of Whatever own your home, why not yourself?""

Distributists on the whole can be seen as a movement for small businesses over both big business and big government and home-ownership.

Distribusts also often oppose usury, which in a financial crisis in the financial center of Europe sounds interesting. But they cannot always fully agree what exactly is usury. Some say only consumption loans are usury, productive investment is OK, some other say fixed-interest productive interest is also usury, productive investment should be a partnership with the same risks for both parties.

Dann wären auf einem Schlag nicht nur sämltich V-Leute bei islamistschen Organisationen, Rockerbanden, Neonaziorganisationen, der Balkanmafia und und und in Gefahr, sondern zugleich noch deren Familie und Kontaktleute. All diesen Elementen der organisierten Kriminalität in Deutschland würde man sicherlich einen riesen Gefallen tun, wenn man ein Instrument schafft mit dem das enttarnen von verdeckten Ermittlern so leicht wie noch nie würde.

The profits will not be taxed in the UK.* **This is not tax avoidance: it is simply the way that corporation tax works.**

&gt;*Most major economies operate corporation tax in the same way as the UK, so UK-resident companies are treated in a similar way in other countries. In other words, UK companies do not pay corporation tax to another country on the profits from sales in that country, unless they trade through a branch based there. Instead, they pay corporation tax in the UK*

There was severe opposition to the Ally-supported junta of 1967-1974, even though people who openly opposed it were tortured, imprisoned under terrible conditions, executed or forcefully exiled.

There were anti-junta movements from the very beginning, and there were **massive** pro-democratic protests as soon as the Papandreou Funeral in 1968. Greek music and poetry was heavily influenced by anti-junta sentiments, despite the aforementioned deterrents and the obvious censorship.

The climax of the anti-junta movement was probably the uprising at the Polytechnic, which lead to several casualties and is still celebrated as a national holiday to this day. Hell, there are laws forbidding the entry of police into the grounds of any greek university unless they are given the green light through a very complicated procedure.

Not only were the junta members arrested when democracy was restored, but they were given punishments similar to those of the Nuremberg trials. Hell, even in 1990 when an amnesty was being planned it was cancelled after protests from **conservatives**, **socialists** and **communists**. That's pretty much every major political party at the time.

Out of all this, do you think that asking as to whether a major pro-fascism sentiment among the population remained is reasonable?

The votes that Golden Dawn received prior to the previous elections were below 1%. It is much more likely that their inherent nationalist, populist and reactionist policies seem welcome to a minority of an exhausted people who have witnessed a massive and sudden loss of quality of life, have been characterized as a nation of thieves and couch potatoes by every douchebag politician in Europe and beyond, rather than the notion that a pro-fascist sentiment developed overnight.

It is ironic that people that want to defend democracy are protesting about a political party that got 7% through elections. It's not like they entered the parliament by force!

It would be much healthier if everyone complained to the current government that does absolutely nothing about the problems that allowed GD to rise and sustain their voters.

If there is nothing done about the problems GD will always be there to fill the gap in some people's minds. They will not go away by compaining, they will not go away if a new post is made here everyday. They will only go away if the problems that they claim they will solve go away.

Now that a right-wing party entered the parliament some people are acting like it is the end of the world.

I won't lie, accidental invasions sound fun and quirky.

I think that it goes without saying that when you invade another country, exterminate a significant percentage of their population, empty its banks, significantly decrease its work-able population, you are to be expected to follow the eventual peace treaty that will be signed.

After all, what kind of legality does a government which invades another country, agrees to a conditional peace, but never actually abides by these conditions have?

And while this is not a greek issue, but an international one, your attempts to minimize it by bringing up historical examples and determining that any adherence to reparations is ridiculous has one major flaw-- as far as I am aware, most of the conflicts you are referring to never had war reparations as a condition under their peace treaty (such as ""the trillions that Bulgaria has received from the Ottoman empire"").

It is not shocking that Germany would deny paying (or claim that they would pay them in the future) war reparations to the countries it invaded in order to develop itself, it is rather shocking that a) In the case of Greece, and I'm sure there are more cases, the  families of idividual Holocaust victims were denied reparations, not by some corrupt government member, but actual German **courts**, b) This enormous German debt never seems carry over today. Skipping the obvious moral issues with the first one, the second implies that any other country in debt could follow the German example and just decide to not pay. If we establish this as a precedent, then it is likely that the a quite a few Spanish, Portoguese, Italian, Greek, etc people would also find it a keen idea to not pay their debts, with catastrophic results.

Of course, that just touches the tip of the iceberg. Foreign involvement post-WW2 in Greece resulted to the support of a military junta and earlier, a government which was one of the initiating parties of a Civil War. 

You ask what makes the Greeks so unique-- but here's the thing, pretty much any country currently in debt which has yet to receive war reparations is in the same situation. So this is not about Greece being unique at all, it's about Greece being part of a group of countries in serious debt right now.

While not even in anyone's wildest dreams, would the German government decide to start paying their debts, both for financial reasons, but also due to lack of moral backbone (See: German courts denying reparations to Holocaust victims), I think that it is to at least be expected that Germany takes a more lenient stance towards countries it owes a massive debt.

And yet, Germany is clearly one of the few countries in the Eurozone that has such a harsh policy towards countries in debt, something hypocritical to a tragic extent. 

While austerity measures **need** to be taken (and I challenge you to prove that Greece ever disagreed with the idea of austerity itself), as the rise (which while exaggerated, is rather significant) of the far-right in Greece and the massive decrease in quality of life demonestrate, the measures imposed today have been clearly applied in a wrong manner, targetting the wrong social classes.

&gt;What more, they are still poorer than the Greeks

In regards to what? Total debt? Debt per capita? Average salary per working hour (let's not forget that Greek employees work the most hours in Europe)? Unemployment? Development Rates?

Maybe there is a poorer Eurozone nation in regards to some of these criteria, but I'd like to see evidence of the existence of such a nation when taking into account **all** of the relevant criteria.",0,1352143275,null,0,false,0,c6wu66p,t3_12nwuj,t1_c6wu66p,t1_c6wtfsb,null,1430327437,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The nazis were considered vile assholes most of the time - the Klooga extermination camp had guard revolts, because the former members of the Estonian police were forced to guard it. A battle broke out between the guards and the German SS when the retreating German forces wanted to execute the prisoners.

Remember how in the 30s the governement tired to make all Estonians de-germanize their names and how the cultural life was full of anti-(balto)german propaganda? This continued even after the war. Granted, it was forced by the Soviets by then, but it was the same sentiment of seeing Germans as the enslavers of Estonians. 

Also, before the nazi invasion, Estonia shipped thousands of jews to Sweden for refuge. Sadly many remained and were murdered by the nazis.

The only time nazis were ""greeted"" was right after the 1941 deportations - the nazis promised to reinstate independent Estonia and drove off the Soviets who had shown the true terror of Stalin. The nazis were greeted by some people on the streets. The promise of independence turned out to be a lie within weeks or less.

What country are you talking about? If you are talking about Germany, they have abided to those I am sure you are aware of the treaty of London, in 1952-1953 (?) which Greece signed. If the Greeks want to make a case, go for Italy. Why don't you? 

Furthermore, you seem to imply that since you have suffered so much more than other countries and not received enough reparations, this is the reason the Greek state is in the state is in.

Well, I give you to countries that have it worse, been poorer, received less (or no) payment.


I give you Poland and Estonia. Estonia ceased to exist after WWII, certainly did not receive any war reparations, nor have they received any compensation from the Soviet union, a country you might have heard of....They lived in dictatorship until 1991 when they finally *became a country again*(when Greece was well back on track, in the EG/EU from whom you have received money every year and democracy). I am sure you have heard about the financial crises in 2008. Are you saying that Greece have had it tougher? Oh, and you are being bailed out by them as well, despite the fact that they are also in the Euro, have a lower GDP, GDP per capita etc. They just choose not to take all the loans that Greece took.

Poland - every 6th citizen killed during WWII (did that happen to Greece?), constantly moving borders due to the fact that it is where it is geographically, which is sort of tough. Was a country, but under communist, Soviet regime until 1989 when the wall fell. Again, a lot later than Greece of course. Are rebuilding their economy, it is going well over all when you look at it. 

Have you suffered much more than these countries in the terms of invasion and dictatorship, or just in WWII? Why have Greece suffered more? I'd like a list please, what makes the Greek suffering so unique. Why are you economy not on the way to be rebuilt in the way that these economies are? Have you had it worse? You have been a democracy for longer

&gt;It is not shocking that Germany would deny paying (or claim that they would pay them in the future) war reparations to the countries it invaded in order to develop itself, it is rather shocking that a) In the case of Greece, and I'm sure there are more cases, the families of idividual Holocaust victims were denied reparations, not by some corrupt government member, but actual German courts, b) This enormous German debt never seems carry over today. Skipping the obvious moral issues with the first one, the second implies that any other country in debt could follow the German example and just decide to not pay. If we establish this as a precedent, then it is likely that the a quite a few Spanish, Portoguese, Italian, Greek, etc people would also find it a keen idea to not pay their debts, with catastrophic results.

A) Sigh, we are not talking about German reparation to Jews here, the German reparations to the Jews have nothing whatsoever to with the state of Greee economy. Are you saying that they have? Well, then, most countries in the (former) Eastern Bloc received none, or very little reparation from Germany, and kept on being under Soviet rule (Hungary -56 and Prague -68 for example), were under dictatorship way after Greece - yet, they have sounder finances than Greece. How do you explain that.


&gt;You ask what makes the Greeks so unique-- but here's the thing, pretty much any country currently in debt which has yet to receive war reparations is in the same situation. So this is not about Greece being unique at all, it's about Greece being part of a group of countries in serious debt right now.

OK, so Greece is unique together with - Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria (and that is just in the EU, I can go on and on about Ukraine, Belarus etc) in fact that they (according to themselves) didn't receive enough war reparations. Yet, these countries were under dictatorship longer than Greece, in fact when Greece entered the EG, many of these states  didn't exist. Still, they have managed to build up their economy, and, in case of Estonia and Slovenia, enter the Eurozone without borrowing, borrowing and borrwing, they have balanced their finances. If they could, why couldn't Greece? And, if most of these states, who had a worse starting point than Greece can fix their finances without constant help from IMF, EU, Eurozone, why can't you? 

Again- what makes you so unique and why have you suffered more? I'd like numbers from the WWII for example, why it is worse for you than Poland, or why Estonia apparently had a breeze in the 70's 80's (when they didn't exist btw).

true,Fiedryn,null,null," &gt;I am sure you are aware of the treaty of London, in 1952-1953 (?) which Greece signed.

Actually, I was referring to the Commission in Paris in 1946, which establishes that by today's inflation, the german state owes $557,980,219.78, *along* with the 476 million reichsmark ""loan"" that emptied that national bank. Under a 3% interest rate that today amounts to $95 billion.

The German Finance Ministry today claims that West Germany paid $67 Million Dollars in individual war reparations to Holocaust victims (that's $115 Million today) in 1960, which has since then been challenged by surviving victims and families. 

Even if we choose to disregard this, there is still a staggering debt on Germany which seems to vanish into thin air. The question is, why can Germany just write off billions in debts just like that?

And if Germany can write off billions in debt, should the rest of Europe do so too?

&gt; If the Greeks want to make a case, go for Italy. Why don't you?

Let's throw Italy under the bus! They have signed the same treaties, it's not like if a case can't be made against Germany, that it can be made against Italy.

Well, here's the thing; while a case can be made against Italy, they certainly paid war reparations towards the Ionian Islands, so they did pay part of their debt, unlike what Germany appears to have been done.

Either way, Italy is to some extent in the same boat as Greece, as opposed to Germany, which is the strongest economy in the Eurozone. It would seemingly be rather hypocritical to promote leniency towards countires in debt and with decreasing quality of life, while demanding money from Italy. After all, leniency is all to be expected. It has been well-established, even by the diplomats handling this issue that Germany has no qualms with not paying the war debt.

Should Italy's economy grow again, some arrangement must be found between the two countries. Just like Greece is planning to pay its debt, so should everyone else.

&gt;(snip)

While I can certainly empathize towards countries which had to suffer USSR's terrible administration, you're following the same fallacious reasoning that you have followed since the beginning of this argument: Did the USSR pledge to war reparations for any of these countries?

Please reassess your reasoning and respond to all of my points from both of my posts. You don't cherrypick arguments in a debate.

Also, nailing down the situation of the greek economy to reckless loaning is incorrect. While it is certainly a contributing factor, the lack of heavy manufacturing for decades, a huge public sector that couldn't pay for itself, and finally lack of governmental transparency in regards to the debt are also pretty important reasons for the crisis today.

Also, let's talk about how Poland is totally not fighting to get the reparations it rightfully deserves back:
&gt;The Polish Sejm, or Parliament, unanimously backed the resolution, with 328 deputies voting for it. There was one abstention.
The resolution said Poland ""has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damages and material and non-material losses caused by the German aggression, occupation, genocide and loss of independence.""
Under the Nazi occupation, six million Poles, including the country's 3.1 million-strong Jewish community, were killed.

http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/11/news/11iht-poland_ed3__0.html?_r=0

Also, concerning Greek casualties in WW2: Approximately 560,000 out of 7,344,900. That should be around the half as Poland, percentage-wise, just fyi.

&gt; what makes the Greek suffering so unique.

I warned you about distorting the facts by your logic, but I thought it was accidental at the time. Anyway, although I thought that I had made myself clear in my previous post, essentially repeating this twice:

This is most certainly NOT about Greece, exclusively, but about a group of countries who had never had war reparations paid to them and currently in serious debt. This applies to Greece just like it applies to any other country out of that group. If you wish to repeat the ""For a country to demand to be repaid its war debt, implies that it considers itself special"" faux argument please direct it to someone interested into a non-debate. Thank you.

Now, on this issue in relation to Poland: While Poland is not in serious debt, it has clearly made moves to extent its demand of Germany paying in debt. That is their right, and it's very good that someone finally stands up against this situation.

Concerning this and your question about reparations to Greek Holocaust victims. No, I didn't mean to somehow deduce the idividual reparations from the greek debt, but rather aimed to demonestrate the moral profile of the German gov and to provide for yet another debt Germany has refused to acknowledge.

&gt;**(according to themselves)** [..] war reparations

Please explain.

&gt;can fix their finances without constant help from IMF, EU, Eurozone, why can't you?

You do realize that these ""bail-outs"" are not gifts right? Neither do they end up in any greek, portoguese, spanish, italian, irish, etc citizen hands I am aware of, they only serve to get these countries back in the market. And why? So that they can get some more loans in order to repay their older loans. Oh, and all that's with interest.

Maybe it would be wise to consider this the next time you complain about reckless loaning.

&gt; I'd like numbers from the WWII for example, why it is worse for you than Poland

Again, Poland, has made moves to demand for Germany to pay its debts. What you don't seem to be able to understand is that Greece is no different than Poland in this regard, other than the fact that it could use the money.

This isn't a competition of who had it worse (or whom you can demonize more), it's a multinational diplomatic struggle to have Germany recognize its massive debts, and if not repay them, arrange matters differently with the countries it owes to.

Yes, when Germany started redeveloping it preferred to invest its profits in more development rather than paying off its debts. That doesn't mean that its debts magically disappeared now that they are a wealthy state. And if it were to be so, why shouldn't Poland or Greece (among others) refuse to pay back their debts and just invest it in much-needed development as well? It would only seem fair.

&gt;Estonia apparently had a breeze in the 70's 80's (when they didn't exist btw).
Again, which war reparations does Estonia demand or is entitled to? If they have a basis to request reparations from the USSR, I'm 100% behind them.

Either way, it is a fallacy to say ""yes, this is an act of injustice, therefore this other act of injustice is fine.""

I disagree, those statements make it easier for the readers to understand the situation on the ground, to put things in the proper context. It's very surprising that in a country like Romania  with sub-Saharan levels of corruption and poverty a international multi-billion corporation didn't get its way.


&gt; in the case of the Belgrade, where the journalist is writing a piece about the night life etc, and feels that the best way to kick it off is by loading it up with cringeworthy words like war and ""ethnic cleansing"". The tactic is dishonest and fucking annoying.

Les plus riches tendent à pouvoir tricher (prétendre que l'enfant vit avec sa grand-mère dans une ville moins pourrie pour que le lycée de secteur de l'enfant soit celui de cette ville), mais des conseillers (disant tous à quels point cette réforme est une blague) sont consultables dans les établissements scolaires.

Many usually take the crooked logic that everybody who self-identifies as Muslim is a follower of Islam, and a follower of Islam is necessarily one who obeys wholeheartedly all the teachings (a fundamentalist), as Islam is something rigidly defined. Therefore, everybody who self-identifies as Muslim is a staunch follower of Islam.

Actually, the fundamentalists you see are a modern innovation. They are as close to the original as neo-protestant „non-denominational” Christians are to the original Christians.

Any kind of „return to the Golden Age” movement sees just a romanticised version of the past it seeks to recreate, not the real thing.     

Also, religious innovation is indeed frowned upon in Sunni islam, but in Shiite islam, it's not. The islamic republic system of Iran is one such innovation. But we'll have to talk about this some other day.

It's unreasonable when you take words at their face value. Most religious adherents are hypocrites, as you say, because picking and choosing is elementary to religion. So having the expectation that everybody actually a literalist believer is kind of naive.

Serbia got bombed because of the never ending disputes over all the territories that separated. /It is true all of them had constitutions and were completely free to separate, but the decision wasn't based purely on every nations interests/ Serbia was the only country that was not fine with the disassembling of Yugoslavia and in various ways were fighting for the lost territories /just want to make it clear that i do not approve of the war actions/ But because Serbia had the insolence to define what the Great Forces had planned for the region they got bombed. 

&gt;False - Bulgaria refuses to recognize the Macedonian nation and language as separate from Bulgarian, and Macedonia (and its people) has been subject to numerous Bulgarian invasions throughout history. 

I find this statement completely wrong. Bulgaria was one of the first 10 countries to recognize Macedonia as a country and throughout most of Bulgaria's free history /excluding the Ottoman empire and the Byzantine empire/ Macedonia's territory or at least most of it was in the borders of Bulgaria.

The part i wrote about Greece comes directly from Macedonian propaganda websites, but maybe you are right and this is not so relevant given the fact that the same websites put information for the Macedonians being the direct link to adam and eve and that they created civilization.

I really enjoyed reading your comments on everything i said and to a huge extent it helped me realize that it is hard to express an opinion such as mine which is not based on history books or articles but on real life experience and that the way i present it should be clearer so no conflict can arise.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"&gt;Firstly, you can't violate the sovereignty of other nations by being on control of their tax rates just because it makes the policies here at home ineffective.

You're right, we can't. But trade agreements (and of other natures) exist and can be changed/proposed. Reasonability is something that must be expected and pushed for. But still, nothing forces us to deal with a rogue nation that chooses to ignore rules of fair trade and business transparency. This kind of commitment happens a lot these days. The main example is that we're dealing with eastern powers that give little social liberties to their people and downright abuse them, only because they keep buying up treasury bonds (debt) and keeping us afloat. This is not just moral corruption, it's stupid because we'll never be as an attractive workforce as them. In the long run the EU citizens will become closer to Chinese labor and not the way around. Big business would love that and they're pushing hard for it. All the specialized workforce being in the West is crap and everybody knows it won't last. In the meantime, unemployment soars in the EU and still, some people wonder why! Well, check the product labels...

And Switzerland is not like North Korea. There are many agreements in place between us, but still, the Swiss must comply with international law. As for the other EU countries, they're signed with the EU. Most even share a currency!! To me (and plenty of serious economists) this is pushing against the tide. The Irish and dutch make a big fuss about controlling corporate taxing for fear of loosing business. They'll have to choose. Either fully committed with the EU project, or out! And don't refute me with non-related or equivalent arguments with spending deficits and that Portugal sucks or that it's a shitty corrupt place that squandered billions. I'm tired of these arguments in /r/europe.


&gt;""What? There still problems to be fixed? Fucking corrupt idiots and lobbyists!""

The problem is sluggish reforms and a legislative process that is owned by big business. We lack moral spine I don't mean bring on the fascism (another counter-argumentation abused here...) I mean being true to the original EU spirit of union and cooperation for long-term mutual benefits and fairness. In other words, prosperity and sustainability, not division, wars and more social assimmetries. After the 2008 crash everybody talked about how we needed to be more conscious about the social aspects and not just the profit. That talk lasted maybe a few months and gave way to massive austerity, further bailouts and less social spending. The ideological sadists loved it as they don't mind banksters getting bailed out, as long as that sorry assed unemployed with small kids gets his pension cut in half and maybe even returns to the jungle where he came. These are gross but spot on examples of solidarity is like in these hard-times.

Lobbying and corruption is a worldwide plague. Sluggishness, denialism,
scare tactics and other strategies that favor the milking of other EU countries should not drag on. I read Ms Merkel wants 5 more years of austerity, that the UK is planning to veto the budget or just cut loose. Finland this, Netherlands that... and they're discussing it, not in the meetings but over tv channels and for populistic and electionability reasons. Maybe democracy is dying, but we certainly lack strong and wise leaders. 

&gt;Those mega-filthy-rich-slave-owning-child-labor-corporations wouldn't exist if not for their customers.

That is the base issue here. The people are politically gullible, reckless with their vote and are generally stupid but those with much more responsibility are the governments who should be steering our countries and providing a future to the coming generations. They should do much more and be more efficient instead of selling themselves out for the highest bidder.

I firmly believe war is on our horizon. May seem far-fetched to most but I think this because there is great profit in war and because there are limits that once reached, they change the political face of nations and pit them against each other.

true,TarantusaurusRex,null,null,"I found my first family in Paris through [AuPair World](http://www.aupair-world.net), and just like barneycox, it did not cost me a dime.  It also allowed me to personally conduct a number of e-mail and Skype interviews in order to find just the right family.  I did find an AMAZING family, they were cool, laid back, the kids were incredibly well-behaved and funny, and I worked less than 20 hours per week... it was a dream come true.  Most of the other au pairs that I met in Paris were sometimes downright miserable, with spoiled children and rich families that didn't give a shit.  Those girls had used agencies. 

I'm an au pair in Lyon now, and this time I used two other websites to conduct my search:  [Great Au Pair](http://www.greataupair.com) and [AuPair.com](http://www.aupair.com).  The unfortunate thing about Great Au Pair is that they will charge you 45 dollars per month, or 60 dollars for two months.  In my opinion, it's not always worth it because in one month, you will only have a select number of families to contact, and oftentimes those families are members of non-paid sites as well.  I met some interesting families through that website, but I ended up being successful with AuPair.com.  I am now living in Lyon with an INCREDIBLE family, a beautiful little apartment and I am making a good amount of money for an au pair.  

The first mistake that I made:  accepting a small amount of money and very little side benefits.  My first family in Paris only paid me 420 euros per month and gave me an unrenovated chambre de bonne, but did not pay for my groceries, metro pass, classes, or anything else.  After meeting other au pairs, I learned that they all had those things paid for (some made more or less money than me).  The benefit, however, was that I got to work for kick ass family.  But I barely scraped by in Paris, it was so painfully expensive, and I had to pay for everything on my own.

Hope this helps. All I can say is be careful, be thorough, and go with what feels right.  If you have a bad feeling about someone, cut the connection. Don't jump on your first chance, there are so many families in Paris in need of au pairs. In the end, maybe the first family you speak to will be your choice, but you'll be glad that you talked to others and made sure.

P.S. if they're NOT paying for a metro pass or classes, then don't accept less than 500 euros, in my opinion. Paris is so insanely expensive, with 420 euros, I had to stop taking classes. I spent less than 60 euros on clothes all year, and I didn't have a winter coat until January.

On the large multinational company side a simple solution is to replace VAT with a revenue tax for all revenue above £1M - it would be a small amount - a few % . This would greatly simplify administration and greatly reduce associated costs . It would also catch any company trying to export their tax liability by techniques such as transfer pricing and management fees .

On a personal side the combining of all taxes - PAYE and NIC - is a good first start . However in addition all claimables can be eliminated if the taxable income is applied to all dependants - ie. husband and wife together , where only one is working , would be paying less tax than they would be as individuals .

That is the whole point, consumers pay VAT, business pay income tax. They have different aims and are calculated differently.

That would be a normal sales tax. I suggest that you read the article about VAT that I sent so you.

If you are a final consumer you pay VAT, if you're not, you pay nothing, hence the need for income taxes that are dependent on the business financial health and expenses.

&gt;The advantage of the VAT system over the sales tax system is that under sales tax, the seller has no incentive to disbelieve a purchaser who says it is not a final user. That is to say the payer of the tax has no incentive to collect the tax. Under VAT, all sellers collect tax and pay it to the government.
