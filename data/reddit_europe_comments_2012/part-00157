true,SouthPads,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;ultimately i think the goal is for as many people from different perspectives to discuss matters such as this until enough of us reach a consensus large enough to change the direction of the political process

This is true, but it's also a really bad attitude to have. You are saying that the issue needs ""discussion"" as if it hasn't already been discussed over and over. It would be fair enough if there was a better alternative that you had, but you don't even have an alternative to create an opinion or argument for.

You're damning a system to which there is no better alternative. And you may say you're a dreamer, but right now we don't need any more dreams. We need actual solutions to actual problems, and absolutely none of those solutions are going to be pleasant; but they're all going to be better than no solution at all.


**My point summarised:** Don't attack a system when you have no better ideas yourself yet refuse to acknowledge the positives of the system. ""Generating discussion"" is not a get-out-of-jail-free card, especially when you're using rhetoric like ""workers of the continent unite"" in some kind of pseudo-communist diatribe.

true,whatlad,ENGL,England,"the economy requires financial growth to function. you are correct that an economy in recession still exists, but the point is that it is receding, and will not continue to exist if it continues to recede.

so you need growth.

how do you get it? consumer disposable income. creates demand, which creates jobs, which creates more consumer spending, so more jobs, omg awesome sauce

but what if you lose it in recession? consumer spending falls. demand falls. jobs are made redundant, which further decreases consumer spending, so more jobs are lost... not awesome sauce.

this cycle can work in either direction and it can change from recession to growth via the discovery of new markets, which create new jobs, which creates more consumer spending, which etc

but as was already pointed out by samarkandz, it can only work in the UP direction for a limited time (probably for some time yet if properly regulated), because the environment will run out of resources to create goods, or the consumer markets will become oversaturated given that we only have a limited amount of time to enjoy the things we pay for, and a limited amount of space to store them, and that there are only so many consumers, and only so much room for consumers to exist in.

so we establish two things.

Für die Speicherung von 10GWh in einer Hubstrecke von 10m bei einer Materialdichte von 10g/cm³ – ich hab das eben mal ausgerechnet – benötigt man ca 40000m³ Materialvolumen.

Also I find that cookaround got a better organization, since the forum topics are organize by course, or by ""tool"" (microwave, slowcooker, ...)

Europa, no matter her origins, is clearly something we can all identify with. There is no valid way of saying ""Sure, Europa is nice, but how about this local myth..?""

If we want to get something better than bridges that actually exist outside the notes, they must be something that we can ALL think as great. It's even more dangerous if we just pick one from each area. What makes THIS particular example the high point? Why not something else? I'd rather see only one topic handled fully. But let's assume we go with your idea and go worth finding candinates for the notes;

Literature? Shakespeare is only one writer among many outside England. Aleksis Kivi would be similarly redundant to everybody who wasn't a Finn etc. Same with the author of Don Quijote (can't even remember his name, and I saw it written the other day). It's really hard to nail down a book that everybody in Europe feels like they own it.

Folklore? Scandinavian is cool, but so is Finnish - or Polish. Or Celtic, for that matter. And of course Greek/Roman. Why should we pick one over another?



Painting - we have one in Europa - Mona Lisa could perhaps be another, but there are very few others that wouldn't first and foremost be *Italian* painters or *French* painters etc.

Technology? It's inherently about compromises. Seeing as Climate Change is such a heavy topic these days, most technology would be seen as promoting it - excluding windmills, and there are people who even hate THOSE.

Music. Well, perhaps *Ode to Joy*...

Society? I can't really think anything that could be summed up with few pictures.

Politics. Karl Marx? Napoleon? Churchill? Gustav II Adolf? People either love or hate these people, and it's about 50-50 who do and who don't. You can never forge any of these people into continental icons of unity, even forgetting the facts that states would fight to get their own guy in. 

It's better to go with something that might have happened on the area of one state or another, but who nobody can really *own*. Demolition of the Berlin Wall would be a good example; it happened in Berlin, but it's only a symbol of an event that affected everybody in Europe. As such I would say putting it on a note would be a good idea as far as Europe would go, but I'm sure it would cause problems toward Russia, who would see this as promoting discord. But could we think six other similar events? We aren't a continent that has that many happy moments together. I'd say French Revolution gets pretty close, but Brits (and many other countries on the winning side of Waterloo) would probably disagree.",0,1352496352,null,0,1352496552,0,c6yz8f2,t3_12uxu1,t1_c6yz8f2,t1_c6yyuuu,null,1430364553,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

It signifies that stealing something, whether it’s someone else’s idea, or even monies obtained from government or other big institutions through false claims of eligibility or need, is actually a clever and praiseworthy business practice.

Unlike in the UK, Germans expect your CV to have a photo of you on it. It seems a little weird to me considering all the anti-discrimination laws we have back home, but it is what it is.

Unless you are happy to live on €400 a month / are willing to do a bit of ""schwarzarbeit"" moonlighting, then tax is unavoidable and sucks big time.

There is no minimum wage so to speak and what you get paid varies from place to place and the salary is almost NEVER included with the job description, unless it is one of their beloved ""mini-jobs"" which then only pays €400 a month. It is usually written as ""€400 Basis"".

As long as you know the basics you should be ok language wise to begin with, just like at home Germany is very multi-cultural and on the whole people are fairly used to interacting with people who have limited German. (That doesn't mean they like it btw)

Speaking English will be a real bonus, even though I studied German at Uni, I certainly think being English is what helped me eventually find work.

If you can only go to one place in Barcelona, though, I'd choose the Gothic Quarter. It's by far my favorite part of the city and I think you'll find it particularly interesting because of all the history that you can observe in just one building. You will see roman architecture erected over pre-Roman stonework amidst centuries old buildings. 
Another great thing about it is that even though it is a very popular tourist destination, it is very easy to find yourself off the beaten path just by making your way along the narrow streets; it feels personal and exciting—also you can find all sort of interesting spots like that. 

My second favorite spot nearby (not in Barcelona proper) is Montserrat which I bet will satisfy your more ""natural"" interests.

What are you interested in? History? Castles? Cities? Rural areas? Art? Museums? Not-so-touristic places?

Public transport is usually very good in central europe, although it might differ from country to country which one you should prefer. For germany, this would be the train, or if you are more into meeting people, you could try [mitfahrgelegenheit](http://translate.google.de/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mitfahrgelegenheit.de%2F). People offer free places in their cars when they do a trip. So you can pay them a small amount and travel with them - it's cheaper than the train, and you get to know people. Of course you might meet the occasional weirdo.

I can't recomend you things for northern germany as I'm not too familiar with the region, I'll let the northern folks do that ;)
I'll just copy &amp; paste my post from another thread, interesting cities/places in bavaria:

**Regensburg:**
*[View of the City](http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Regensburg_Uferpanorama_2_06_2006.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20060619230718)*

*[The Stone Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Bridge_%28Regensburg%29):* Over 800 years old, served as model for other famous old bridges in Dresden, London&amp; Prague, nothing more to say.
The old town centre with the cathedral is very nice, some nice clubs, good for going out. Also Regensburg is the hme of the [House of Thurn und Taxis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurn_und_Taxis), which is one of the richest houses of Europe and inventors of the modern post system in 16th century.


**Bayreuth:** 
*[The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)
*[The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see

**Bamberg:**
Whoo, where should I begin? 
* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique german medivial town centre. Actualle the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  
*The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope north of the alps.
*Right next to the Cathedral, there is the ""Alte Hofhaltung"" where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers
*The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""
* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above 
* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) (Attemted Hitler assasination, movie with Tom Cruise) had his horse-regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed in 2006.
* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;hl=de&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=18)  as you'll have a superb view over Bamberg and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food. 
*Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;num=30&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=de&amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;t=h&amp;z=17)
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right and enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg
* There is also an quite large US Garrison, so you won't have problems speaking english ;)


**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.
* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.
* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (only i the weeks before christmas)
* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.
*Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe
*[Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp; culture.

There are also interesting places in Thuringia, which is north of bavaria like [Weimar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar) which is famous for Goethe and Schiller, the Weimarer Republik (between the world wars), Bauhaus, Gropius. [Eisenach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenach) is famous for Martin Luther, the Wartburg, and the old town in gerneral.

As a Briton this is what worries me about ever-closer-union in general, and the post-crisis converged eurozone in particular.

I am a liberal individualist, I naturally prefer isaiah berlin's negative liberty, and I worry that that sentiment would be drowned out by a continental enthusiasm for positive liberty.

For this reason as much as any other i cannot accept common eu governance over Britain to be legitimate, for it cannot be both representative of my will and accountable to my demands.

Thus I conclude I have no European identity.

As an aside, perhaps it is merely a quirk of language, but I find this deference to 'intellectuals' very un-British. We are a nation of shop-keepers and retain a natural suspicion of higher authority.

However, the two remain in tension, and Britain has remained a more individualist nation ever since, tho not as pure to the principle as the US has remained.

If you can imagine a spectrum from negative to positive, with the US and Europe at either extreme, then I would posit that Britain sits somewhere in the middle.

true,datenwolf,flag-de,,"&gt; hast Du tausende Tonnen Blei?

Es muss ja nicht unbedingt Blei sein. Es kommt nur auf die Masse an, da kann man jeden beliebigen Gesteinsabraum verwenden. In den Bergbaugebieten liegt mehr als genug davon rum. Man braucht dann halt entsprechend mehr Volumen. Davon ist aber mehr als genug vorhanden, dem deutschen Steinkohleabbau sein Dank.

&gt; aber Solarzellen auf deutsche Dächer zu setzen ist unglaublich ineffizient.

Dieses Argument hört man seit Jahren, ach was sage ich, Jahrzehnten. Vor 20 Jahren hieß es ""um wirtschaftlich zu sein, müssen PV-Zellen mindestens 15% Effizienz erreichen"", die haben mittlerweile selbst Billigzellen, also hat man das Kriterium weiter hoch geschraubt, jetzt müssen es 30% sein.

Dabei ist die Frage doch nicht, wie effizient die einzelne Zelle ist, sondern das Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis (diesmal wirklich buchstäblich). Das was die einzelne PV-Zelle nicht schafft gleicht man eben durch mehr Fläche aus.

Die 15%-Effizienzgrenze von vor 20 Jahren ging davon aus, ein durchschnittliches Haus alleine aus der auf dem Dach installierten Fläche zu versorgen. Damals ging man von einem Leistungsbedarf von *im Mittel* 6kW für eine Familie aus. Bei 100% Effizienz bräuchte man dafür 6m² Fläche. Geht man von 10% Effizienz aus eben 60m², also dem Flächenbedarf einer typischen Kleinfamilienwohnung. Ein typisches Zweifamilienhaus bietet ca. 300m³ Dachfläche, d.h. pflastert man das Dach mit PV-Zellen zu erzeugt es einen erheblichen Überschuss. Diese 20 Jahre alte Modellrechnung bewahrheitet sich gerade auf unzähligen Dächern in Deutschland.

Wichtig ist nur, dass die PV-Zellen so billig werden (wurden) dass man damit ganze Hausdächer abdecken kann, ohne sich zu ruinieren. Seit einigen Jahren sind wir soweit. Und je mehr PV verbaut wird, desto billiger wird es. Typisches Beispiel der Produktivitätssteigerung durch industrielle Massenproduktion.

**TL;DR:** Die Effizienz von PV ist mittlerweilse gut genug; es gibt keine rationalen Argumente mehr, die gegen die Nutzung von PV in unseren Breiten sprechen.

&gt; Wenn ich das richtig verstehe, forderst Du aber eher, dass unser Staat das Geld anderer Leute investieren sollte…

Ja, denn es gibt Aufgaben, die kann man nur als Großprojekt umsetzen. IMHO ist alles, was als überlebensnotwendige Infrastruktur einzuordnen ist Aufgabe des Staates. Bei Straßen, der Wasserver- und Abwasserentsorgung diskutiert man ja auch nicht darüber, da ist das ganz verständlich.

I worked for 70E a week with no French lessons my first year and see now that it really effecte my enjoyment of the city an the job.

* There are so many families wanting a good au pair so you can be picky, be confident in your abilities but of course don't push it.

Learning to say 'no' is the biggest problem I have faced, some families will pay you nothing for babysitting others will give you 11E an hour. Discuss payment before hand

* Get it all in writing and be a grown up about it all, if they said they would pay you on one day make sure they do.

* Ask them all sorts of questions about their kids before you start working with them. When you get there ask them on how they discipline. One family I was allowed to smack the kids if they got out of line. The family I worked for in Italy showed no discipline to their kid so I had to leave out of frustration and my family now just use a stern word. ASK!!!

* If you can get a job in the centre (1-20 districts) because IMHO it's more fun in the centre than living in the suburbs. They'll say it's only 30min away by train but that really means an hour with walking an changing metros. Keep in mind the metro finished at 1am on Saturdays so unless you make lots of friends in the center you'll be stuck with some very early nights.

* Start off on the right foot with the kids, don't let them walk all over you and be stern but fun. I found it hard to discipline at the start of my first job and it really showed in their attitudes towards me nearing the end of the year. Say no and follow through.

* Cool nannies try and teach their kids the Gangan Style dance.

En fait on est sans doute le seul pays ou ça pourrais se faire officiellement, il suffit que l’académie française en change la définition dans son dictionnaire. Après, je ne pense pas que ça soit nécessaire, les opposant au projet ne vont de toutes façon pas rentré chez eux si on change la définition ou si on remplace toutes les occurrences de ""mariage"" par ""union civile"". critiqué l'usage des mots, c'est juste une manière pas très efficace de refusé de mettre sur le même plan hétéro et homosexuel. 

&gt;Quand à l'adoption, là je suis franchement sceptique. C'est pas qu'un couple gay est incapable de donner assez d'amour ou de suffisamment éduquer un enfant, mais à mon avis ça posera un souci au niveau du complexe d'Oedipe, qui est une étape importante dans la construction de l'identité sexuelle de l'enfant. 

Posons la question simplement, si on part du principe qu'un père et une mère sont indispensable, pourquoi acceptons nous les parents unique ? Exactement les mêmes problèmes que tu décris devrait avoir lieu.

&gt;Un enfant de gays sera-t-il obligatoirement gay? Ou inversement? Aura-t-il le choix? Certes je me pose peut-être des question idiotes, mais quand même...

Les enfants d’hétéro ne sont pas systématiquement hétéros, comme ça a été dit, et il n'y a pas de raison de pensé que ça serait différent pour des enfants de gay. De plus, je vois mal en quoi ça serait un problème en soit que les enfants sois gay (du moment qu'ils ont le choix).

&gt;Pour moi il faut que ça reste du cas par cas, autant pour les hétéros que pour les homos. Et ça j'ai pas l'impression que ça soit le cas...

Je suppose que tu parle des adoptions, et je vois pas pourquoi tu dit ça. C'est un sujet que je ne connais pas aussi bien que je l'aimerais, mais il me semblait que les critères d'adoption et le suivie était assez drastique.

Then visit Heidelberg (famous, very old castle, that wasn't bombed in WW2, longest shoping street).

Die garantierten Abnahmepreise werden sowieso zurückgeschraubt. Die Grenze für den Ausbau liegt übrigens bei 53GW installierter Leistung erneuerbarer Energiequellen. Wieso diese krumme Zahl? Weil genau da der ""break even"" liegt, d.h. konventionell erzeugte Energie weniger rentabel als erneuerbare Energie wird.

&gt; Ist aber nicht so, die ganze Branche wäre sofort tot, wenn man das täte.

Das gleiche gilt für die Erzeugung elektrischen Stroms aus Kohle und Kernkraft. Würde man die ganzen versteckten Subventionen (Kohlepfenning… äh …Cent, Aus- und Nachwirkungen des Bergbaus, der Staat trägt die Kosten für den Transport und die Endlagerung radioaktiver Abfälle, die Kosten der Auswirkungen eines GAUs in einem Kernkraftwerk tägt der Staat) streichen, dann wären Kohle und Kernkraft exorbitant teuer und nicht konkurzenzfähig. 

Vor allem die fehlende Verpflichtung eines Versicherungsschutzes von Kernkraftwerken stellt eine nicht zu unterschätzende Subventionierung dar. Wären die Betreiber dazu verpflichtet für jedes ihrer Kernkraftwerke eine Versicherung gegen die möglichen Schäden eines GAUs abzuschließen, würden die aus Rentabilitätsgründen sofort alle KKW abschalten. Versicherungsgesellschaften rechnen genau und selbst unter den Annahmen der 1970er-Jahre bezüglich Wahrscheinlichkeit eines GAUs (die damals, wie wir heute wissen viel zu niedrig angesetzt war) wären die Versicherung so exorbitant teuer, dass sich Kernkraft nicht rechnen würde. Deshalb wurde die Kernenergie vom Versicherungsschutz per extra Gesetz freigestellt.

true,Please_send_baguette,null,null,"&gt; Quand à l'adoption, là je suis franchement sceptique. C'est pas qu'un couple gay est incapable de donner assez d'amour ou de suffisamment éduquer un enfant, mais à mon avis ça posera un souci au niveau du complexe d'Oedipe, qui est une étape importante dans la construction de l'identité sexuelle de l'enfant. 

Le truc, c'est qu'ouvrir les droits à l'adoption ne va rien inventer de neuf. Les enfants de couples de même sexe existent déjà (ben oui, quand on a un désir d'enfants on se débrouille pour en faire. Par le passé quand on avait un mari stérile on se débrouillait avec le voisin ou le facteur, quand on ne trouvait pas de mari on se débrouillait avec un ami, quand on est un couple du même sexe on s'arrange de la même façon). Et d'après la plupart des études faites sur le sujet, ils se portent très bien. Tu connais sans doute des enfants issus de familles homparentales, que tu le saches ou non.

Seulement, sans droit à l'adoption ils n'ont pas de protection légale. Ils sont élevés par deux parents dont un seul a l'autorité parentale et une filiation légale. Si ce parent meurt, disparait ou est incapacité, le second ne peut pas garder les enfants. Il ne peut pas autoriser un acte médical en cas d'urgence. Il ne peut pas transmettre d'héritage (pas avec la même facilité et la même fiscalité que pour un enfant reconnu, en tout cas). Il ne peut pas inscrire ses enfants comme ayant-droits envers la sécurité sociale. Il ne peut pas toucher d'allocations familiales qui bénéficieront ces enfants. Etc. Bref, c'est la merde, et pas à cause de quelque chose d'inhérent aux couples de même sexe, mais à cause des lois qui ne sont pas adaptées. Ouvrir l'adoption aux couples de même sexe, c'est une mesure qui offrira la même protection légale aux enfants de familles homoparentales qu'aux autres enfants. C'est une mesure pro-famille et pro-enfants.

Quant à l'idée que des enfants auraient nécessairement besoin d'un père et d'une mère, ça fait bien longtemps que la France n'y croit pas puisque 1. on laisse les mères célibataires et les veufs élever leurs enfants, 2. on autorise le divorce des couples avec enfants, 3. on autorise l'adoption par les célibataires.

&gt; Un enfant de gays sera-t-il obligatoirement gay? Ou inversement? Aura-t-il le choix? Certes je me pose peut-être des question idiotes, mais quand même... 

De la même façon qu'un enfant de couple hétéro n'est pas forcément hétéro (de toute évidence...) il n'y a pas de raison qu'un enfant de couple homo soit nécessairement homo.

Nein, es ist ein sehr gutes Argument um faire Vergleiche führen zu können. Die Elektrizitätsinfrastruktur in Deutschland wurde damals von Staatsbetrieben aufgebaut. Praktisch jedes mittlere und große Kraftwerk in diesem Land wurde durch staatliche Mittel im Bau subventioniert, entweder direkt, oder durch steuerliche Vergünsitungen; die Rentabilität war dabei nachrangig, Deutschland im Wirtschaftswunder brauchte den Strom.

Der Aufbau jedweder Großinfrastruktur erforder immer Subventionen in der Anfangsphase.

Die Förderung der PV durch garantierte Stromabnahmepreise kommt am Ende sowieso günstiger als die Subventionierung nach dem Gießkannenprinzip, da dies erzwingt, dass die Anlagen auch so gebaut werden, dass sie Strom produzieren und auch los werden.

Das wäre doch eigentlich gar keine so blöde Idee. Ein Maglev-Streckennetz halte ich langfristig für unumgänglich; spätestens dann wenn Kerosin so teuer wird, dass Kurzstrecke (also alles unter 2000km) fliegen einfach keinen Sinn mehr ergibt. Die Transrapid-Pläne fürs Ruhrgebiet und MUC-Airport ←→ München waren doch total Banane. So ein Höchstgeschwindigkeits-Transportsystem ergibt doch nur auf längeren Strecken auf denen die Geschwindigkeit gehalten wird einen Sinn. Aber wir kommen vom Thema ab…

--- 

&gt; Am günstigsten für uns alle wäre es, wenn vor dem Bau eines Kraftwerks gefragt würde: wieviel Strom wird gebraucht,

Genau das wird sich in Zukunft immer schwerer kalkulieren lassen. Die einhellige Meinung der Elektrotechniker ist, dass die zukünftige Elektrizitätsversorgung dezentral und mit Einplanung großen Schwankungsbreiten erfolgen muss. Große Grundlastkraftwerke sind da eher ein Klotz am Bein, weil man die nur schlecht regeln kann.

&gt; PV hätte dabei niemals eine Chance. Aber PVlern ist das egal, ihre betriebswirtschaftlichen Gewinne werden ja staatlich garantiert.

Also ich kenne eine Menge Leute mit PV-Anlagen auf dem Dach, die auch mit weniger Geld/kWh zufrieden wären, wenn sie dafür im Gegenzug die Leistungsabgabe ihrer Anlagen nicht künstlich auf max. 70% der installierten Leistung drosseln müssten.

Die meisten Leute entschließen sich nämlich dafür ihre Anlagen auf vollständige Einspeisung ins öffentliche Netz auszulegen und den von ihnen verbrauchten Strom normal zu beziehen. Tatsächlich ist es aber bei der derzeitigen Lage günstiger, die Anlagen im Überschusseinspeisebetrieb – d.h. der Eigenbedarf wird soweit es geht von der Anlage gedeckt, der Rest geht in's Netz, falls die PV-Leistung nicht ausreicht, kauft man den Strom vom Energieanbieter – zu einem weitaus geringeren Abnahmepreis zu betreiben.

&gt; Aber dann sollten wir es erst *dann* einsetzen.

Genau dieses *dann* ist das Problem. Mit dieser Haltung wird man das Thema so lange vor sich herschieben, bis andere es eben doch *jetzt* machen und sich damit einen wertvollen technologischen Vorsprung verschaffen. Selbst wenn die Technik noch nicht optimal ausgereift ist. Und meines persönlichen Erachtens nach ist die PV seit ca. 5 Jahren so weit ""gut genug"" für den breiten Einsatz bei uns zu sein.

* 1 glass of milk (250ml)

* 200g of nuts and almonds

Procedure:

Add yeasts to a small amount of milk. Mash eggs with sugar and mix with molded butter. While mashing add flour, milk and previously prepared yeasts. Work on dough to the moment when small air bubbles appear. After that leave dough until it ""grows"". Boil almonds, nuts and poppy, mash and sugar and sour cream until it is dense. Roll the dough and cut into squares. Put the filling on each of the squares, form croissants and leave in warm place.

Luckily I don't care much about ethnicity and nationality, so I am not too hurt by not getting full admission to the German club, but I can really see how this attitude turns people with immigration roots against their home countries (in Germany's case even 2nd and 3rd generation turks feel stronger connections to Turkey than Germany for example; a friend of mine's family has been here for three generations coming from Croatia, but because of the exclusion the guy has felt his whole life, because of his name and his grandparent's heritage, he has started referring to himself as Croation first, despite being born and raised here).

To clarify, as I wrote elsewhere on Reddit today (and thus didn't realize to expand here - forgive me);

&gt;If you like, this is similar to how American and European neonazis have different standards on what counts as the ""superior race"" (American would claim it would be about being ""pure White"", European would claim it was about being connected to the historical heritage of the nation - and being separated from it, you are little better than a member of the unwanted minority yourself).

You don't have to be far-right to have attitudes like this; most Europeans tend to think like this (as European countries are nation-states and the identities are heavily tied to the historical ancestors who lived on the area).

Still, only very few are chauvinist enough to think acting on it is a *good* thing.

Personal story;
One of my closest friends' parent (I forget which one) is from Africa and all my friend has to show from it is an interesting skin colour and enough skill in French to curse using the right phrases. Finnish born and raised (even has a Finnish name). Knows damn well from what tribe his Finnish parent is from, how to ski, how to navigate in a forrest without compass etc etc. Never left the country for any reason.

Meanwhile, my parents have dragged me around the world due to their job before finally settling in Helsinki. I have no idea to which tribes my parents belong to, I get lost if there are five trees around me and I can only ski on well laid path (and poorly, at that). And I still catch myself thinking that I have more right to be here than my friend does. This of course makes me ashamed, but that's the way the cultural values work - I look like I belong, he doesn't. That I know this is idiotic doesn't really help any.

British have *chavs* and in Portugal we have *gunas*. I'm sure other countries have their own.

This adds little to solve the problem of multiculturalism. The idea here seems akin to legitimize the actions of the Muslim hardliners, when in fact, the reasons behind both parts are quite different in nature, one is of religious nature and the other is cultural and economical.

Solve the problem by not dumping money into defense or banks and instead put it into educating the people and allow them to prosper.

There is a completely false video of dutch origin that says Muslims will outnumber the rest of us in a couple of generations. It isn't true and is poorly based. But if the trend continues and it won't, it would take well over 100 years.

Islam, as well as Judaism, have specific passages in their holy books regarding their home state. One calls for the creation of the [Ummah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah) and we can interpret this however we like it (it is religion) and the other calls for hegemonic power of the land of Israel or [Tzion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion), currently labeled as Zionism and criticized for expansionism and apartheid.

As for the shipping magnates, I'm not sure if they can be considered part of the greek economy or ""internationals"", I don't think they really give a shit about the average greek. 

Greece had a booming industrial sector during the 50s and 60s. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_economic_miracle) If you go and and have a conversation with people aged 80+ most of them will talk of working in actual companies and factories but then add ""and a few years later the factory closed"". My great uncle worked in some place that manufactured buses. 

And then the far right millitary junta and the socialists in the 80s installed all the political eunuchery and clientelism that transformed the economy into total bullshit. Try to find any mentions of the ""lazy overpaid greek on a strike"" stereotype before the 80s, it didn't exist, the whole culture and attitude and eventual mockery was born when A.Papandreou tried to carry out his vision of a socialist economy.

Essentially he would tax all the corporations and take EU money to hire
voters (""the people"") in service related jobs. As the corporations were to approach bankruptcy his plan was to take them over with the help
of the worker unions, nationalize and revitalize them, and then live ever after in some perfect socialist utopia.

What really happened is that the corporations closed, the people that took some of them over weren't really into the whole innovation thing, more into using them as excuses to get cuts from huge funds while giving bigger salaries to the workers used as a cover in some kind of pyramid of corruption scheme, this corruption soon spread everywhere with the new rule being the political golden boy comes over here, blames capitalism, ""closes"" the market, gives bigger salaries, gets his cut, we act like some kind of small cartel, and all the above go into the negative budget and get covered by loans.

This pattern is everywhere from the shipyards (the prime example of how this so called ""socialism"" destroyed our industries, they went from being pretty much the real thing, a heavy industry in greece, to since 1985 when they got under national control going bankrupt getting involved in myriads of scandals including one ""socialist politician"" stealing 140 million euros for his own socialist ass, and having their workers being the country's own version of the lazy stereotype cause of all the strikes they kept doing) the irs the pharmacies to the taxi drivers etc.

I mean what kind of non low skill worker based industries can operate here when even the shipyards go bankrupt. You see how Spain and Ireland have created ""pseudo sillicon valley"" initiatives in Malaga Galway etc. I don't know how successful they are but they at least do give some jobs to people.  Well good luck seeing this happen in Greece when the above web of corruption I described will block anything unless they get their dirty hands on it, or even just to make sure that there is no precedent of anything making money without it being under their control.

so Greece is lead by a corrupt and incompetent ruling class… yet they aren't suffering the brunt of austerity.

Pour les voyages tu as la Suisse, l'Autriche et l'Allemagne tout proche. Un peu plus loin tu as aussi la Tchéquie où passer des fins de semaine très sympas et pour pas cher!
 Contrairement à ce qui a été écrit plus haut Besac n'est pas perdue, on a même une gare TGV  (2 heures de Paris)!!  C'est une ville plutôt petite mais à taille humaine, pas mal d'espaces verts aussi pour courir ou simplement se ballader.
Quels types d'études vas-tu suivre? Il y a deux campus: un en centre-ville pour les sciences humaines et la médecine et un autre plus excentré (La Bouloie) avec notamment les sciences économiques,juridiques, staps (sport).
Globalement j'ai trouvé que les infrastructures de ces campus étaient correctes, même si un peu vieillissantes à la Bouloie.  
Le réseau de transports en commun y est bien développé. A l'époque je faisais tout en bus très facilement (abonnement étudiant). Ils sont en train de développer le tramway mais je ne peux pas te dire ce que cela donne.
Le coût de la vie y est globalement peu élevé que ce soit pour les loisirs ou le logement: l'avantage d'être dans une région rurale!
Après Besançon est la capitale régionale, tu as donc une offre culturelle intéressante (certes ce n'est pas Paris!) avec théâtres , musées et cinés...
Niveau musique, la plupart des groupes en tournées en France passent par Besac. Et à la fin de l'année tu as le festival des eurockéennes de Belfort pour te récompenser de ton dur labeur tout au long de l'année.
Autre point qui mérite d'être souligner: la gastronomie. Si tu es amateur de vins, de fromages (la cancoillotte!) et de charcuteries...
Tu l'auras compris j'aime beaucoup cette ville et la Franche-Comté, et j'y ai vraiment de bons souvenirs...

Getting a job with a BSc is nice and all but the MSc adds quite a bit to your possibilities in the future and carries WAY further than many people realize, especially in a country like Germany where people still go by ""the higher your degree, the better you are"". Many unis offer Informatik MSc programs in English, e.g. Darmstadt and Munich, it's much harder to get accepted as a foreigner though. If you have good grades you should be ok if you apply for several programs, German universities will generally try to get a good relationship with US unis so if you're getting the BSc at a renowned uni you will have a better chance. 

I figure you won't have language problems at all because anybody who does CS here speaks English fluently and obviously programming is always going to be in English. In addition to that there are many English speaking communities at and around uni. I have to warn you about overestimating your German skills though. Even after 2 years of courses you are going to hit a brick wall with these tests if you don't prepare with everything you've got. German is considered one of the hardest languages to learn for a reason. I've seen German language majors fail miserably at everyday conversations.

If it's on private property, then the government has no say in the matter.

Here's [another article](http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt/detalhe/noticias/ultima-hora/filme-de-portugal-proibido-na-alemanha) that has two paragraphs that Chrome translates as:

*""The movie was not, however, a big screen broadcast of the Potsdam Square in Berlin, because he explained Moita of God interpreted by the company behind the screen as having a political message.""*

*""Those in charge of the initiative are now trying their dissemination in other places of the capital.*""

So, did a private company refuse to screen it on their private property, or did the government refuse permission for a screening on a public square? If the former, why would the overnment be involved, and if the latter, was it the federal government or the city, and was it for Potsdamer Platz specifically? The second paragraph seems to indicate that it was about the location.

Britain is a free society, which has nevertheless introduced major limitations on free speech to try to protect ethnic and religious minorities. It is more or less impossible to completely eradicate these opinions and this behaviour from society, just as it has proven impossible thus far to stop kids like these abusing other vulnerable people in their communities. The difference with the recent examples in Ukraine and Serbia is the official and communal response to the problem. Ukraine had thousands of football supporters chanting Sieg Heil and giving Nazi salutes, the police chief said they might have been waving hello, Serbia had thousands of fans making monkey chants, and their FA went on a campaign to discredit the claims. When a single British football fan was recently caught making monkey gestures, he was immediately issued a lifetime ban. This is not just about the presence of racist individuals within a country, it is about the willingness of the rest of society to do something about it, or at least to acknowledge and condemn it. And that is where there is an enormous differences between Britain and Serbia, and Ukraine.

The roasted goose breast with the dumplings I get only in restaurants – because it’s really annoying and no fun to make. Homemade pizza is awesome if you know what you are doing, but also tends to be a destroyer of kitchens. At least if I’m cooking.

They not only have to deal with the grey wave of old people retiring soon and - thanks to their one-child policy - not having enough of a work force to sustain their growth under these circumstances, they ALSO have to deal with the fact that an increasing amount of families are entering the middle-class, getting ""liberalized"" and slowly adopting Western ideals as their own. China's economic growth has been solely fuelled by the efforts working class, which has provided cheap labour for decades. Now that the working class is decreasing in size and the income gap is widening, we are seeing more and more workers protesting for better wages and work place standards around the country. China is nearing a crossroads where they will have to make a choice as to how to deal with this problem. I can only see two ways of dealing with it:

1) Give the workers more rights - higher wages. This means increased production costs for international companies outsourcing their production to China. More companies will choose cheaper alternatives to a Chinese production line, such as one based in Vietnam where *it is already* ~30% cheaper. We haven't seen the huge shift yet because supply chain issues, so far, outweigh the cheaper production in Vietnam, but circumstances will be different once it is 60% cheaper in Vietnam due to wage increases in China.
China knows this and has already invested a huge amount of money into trying to attract other kinds of business to the country; mostly financial services, but we've all heard about the ghost skyscrapers..

2) Maintain status quo in the working class by suppressing the workers. There is obviously no good way out of this approach for China.

Bit hyperbolic don't you think? If each generation wasn't smaller than the last you'd be able to pay for it a lot better. And what choice do you have? Your current rate of population decline will mark the end of your country by the time this century is over, barring some unexpected surprises.

Then you better make fucking sure that your immigrants feel German and identify with German culture and ideals above all others.

This is moot though, the fertility of immigrants pretty much drop to levels similar to the host country after only a few generations as soon as their standard of living rises to parity with the natives. 

That said, if it is such a concern I'd say import immigrants from cultures with a good track record with assimilation. The US lucked out with European immigrants but there are still good prospects in Asia and Latin America. You should have never accepted so many uneducated Turks into your country as cheap labor in the first place, but hindsight is what it is.

About the tuition fee, it depends on your income level, and it can go from 500€ to 2500€. I pay around 800€ a year with my dads salary of around 2800€/month.

If you want to study engineering, keep in mind that undergraduate (i mean the whole 5 years) in Italy is hard. It is not often said, but undergraduate around the world is often a joke in respect to the italian one, due to the fact that there's a lot more theory and much less practice, while most of the rest of the world focuses much more on one field, hence being more practical. I personally thing that the ""forma mentis"" that the italian university give to engineering maybe be  penalising at first, but pays well in the long run.

So it's for 25 (or 5 or 15, depending on the parts of the text you read!) years of payments. You will not get much more here. My wive has accumulated disability rights for ~500 with 20 years of work.

Also, it's the ""Basic"" pension and it has multiple mentions of ""disability"". So I still not convinced that this is supposed to be the *sole* income the pensioners get, which I still doubt. And if it's supplemental, they can cut it all they want for all I care now.

EDIT: Oh and look what I found here (German):

http://www.partnerbiz.net/griechenland-sozialversicherung.html

The gist is that OGA isn't really supposed to be a pension insurance, it's more like welfare. It's also not a ""main"" insurance, but rather supplemental. The people pay little too no contributions (35 EUR/Month!) and almost everything is payed for by taxes.

And you get insurance for your relatives. So you pay less than 10 % of the benefits, get your relatives insured *and* get the whole bundle after a measly 5-15 years. This frankly seems like a pretty swell deal, if you ask me.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims_to_be_the_fastest-growing_religion

&gt; Christianity is the fastest growing in terms of most followers, Islam in terms of most annual converts, and Hinduism in terms of born per year.

&gt; According to the Guinness Book of World Records , Islam is the world’s fastest-growing religion by number of conversions each year: ""Although the religion began in Arabia, by 2002 80% of all believers in Islam lived outside the Arab world. In the period 1990-2000, approximately 12.5 million more people converted to Islam than to Christianity"".[5] Part of the books quote can be seen online from this extract from Google Books.[5] This was again shown in the 2005, 50th anniversary edition of Guinness Book of World Records, although the number of conversions was not mentioned this time.[6]
In 1990, 935 million people were Muslims and this figure had risen to around 1.2 billion by the year 2000, meaning that around this time one in five people were followers of Islam. According to the BBC, a comprehensive American study concluded in 2009 the number stood at 1 in 4 with 60% of Muslims spread all over the Asian continent: ""A report from an American think-tank has estimated 1.57 billion Muslims populate the world - with 60% in Asia"".[7][8] The report was done by the Pew Forum Research Centre.[8] The forum also projected that in 2010 out of the total number of Muslims in the world 62.1% will live in Asia.[7]
However the report also included a statement saying ""While the global Muslim population is expected to grow at a faster rate than the non-Muslim population, the Muslim population nevertheless is expected to grow at a slower pace in the next two decades than it did in the previous two decades. From 1990 to 2010, the global Muslim population increased at an average annual rate of 2.2%, compared with the projected rate of 1.5% for the period from 2010 to 2030"".[7] The report also made reference to the fact that Muslims are estimated to make up 23.4% of the total global population in 2010 (out of a total of 6.9 billion people) and that by 2030 Muslims will represent about 26.4% of the global population (out of a total of 7.9 billion people).[7] The Pew report also highlights that there is insufficient data available on religious conversion from its own findings given the complexities of identity and the difficulties of obtaining data: ""Statistical data on conversion to and from Islam are scarce. What little information is available suggests that there is no substantial net gain or loss in the number of Muslims through conversion globally...""[9]

Es ist richtig Menschen Asyl zu gewähren und sie vor Verfolgung zu schützen. Das gilt für Opfer des Bürgerkriegs in Syrien genauso wie für die Sinti und Roma die jetzt in ein Land abgeschoben werden, in dem sie systematisch verfolgt und ausgegrenzt werden.




**Noch ein Zitat aus derPressemitteilung von Abschiebestop Düsseldorf:**


Auch im Hinblick auf die derzeitigen antiziganistischen Diskurse in
Politik, Medien und nun vielerorts lokal entstehenden Bürgerinitiativen
gegen Flüchtlinge ist es wichtig zu betonen, dass Roma seit Jahrhunderten benachteiligt und verfolgt werden. Auch heute noch werden sie in Deutschland und europaweit mittels rassisistischer Vorurteile für ihre soziale und ökonomische Benachteiligung verantwortlich gemacht.

Menschenrechts- und Flüchtlingsorganisationen beklagen die Situation der Roma in Serbien und anderen Ex-Jugoslawischen Staaten. Der UNHCR veröffentlichte einen Bericht, in dem Serbien nicht mehr als sicheres Drittland bezeichnet wird. Der Flüchtlingsrat NRW veröffentlichte ebenso einen Bericht über die Situation der abgeschobenen Minderheit in Serbien, aus welchem deutlich wird, wie schutzbedürftig die als „Asylbetrüger“ bezeichneten Menschen gerade in den Wintermonaten und nach einer erfolglosen Asylantragsstellung in EU-Ländern sind. Auch durch den Druck einer möglichen Streichung der Visafreiheit serbischer Staatsbürger*innen innerhalb der EU, verschärfen sich die Kontrollen, Repressionen und Vorurteile gegen Roma in Serbien.

Da ein zumindest humanistisch kurzlebiger Wintererlass (Abschiebestop über die Wintermonate) in diesem Jahr in NRW nicht mal mehr zur Debatte stand, weil derzeit durch Innenminister Friedrich und unter Unterstützung NRW's Innenminister Jäger, sogar Bundespolizei und Bundeswehrverwaltung zur verkürzten Asylantragsbearbeitung herangezogen werden, um die sich derzeit wöchentlich neu gründenden rassistischen Bürgerinitiativen zu befrieden und politische Fehlentwicklungen mittels Rassismus zu erklären, ist ein öffentlicher Gegendiskurs gerade auch in Zeiten einer Verschleierung der NSU-Aufklärungen und den Pogromen vor 20 Jahren dringend notwendig um rassistischen/rechtspopulistischen Entwicklungen in Zeiten der

Consequently, it's absolutely impossible to know how many converts there are.

Same in UK, the only way those surveys are done is by asking the local imams in the mosques. They tend to inflate the numbers because nearby mosques are competing with one another. They obviously don't keep any paperwork on that, so just making shit up is easy.

Another thing is the number of apostates, I can assure you that in the Middle East and most of Asia almost all of them are closeted and won't tell that they're non-religious even if asked in a safe setting.

You don't have principles. You think we're all equal until you get the chance to parade a supposed moral superiority, then we're not so equal (you said it above, you're better than other people). This isn't a principle, it's hipocrisy. Respect the man's demonstrated wishes, give him death. Principles of equality include respect for one another.

In Novgorod that culture was combined with European influences, whereas the Muscovite civic culture was more akin to that of the Golden Horde they'd once been subject to.

Of course we are better. In two ways: Firstly we're not psychotic killers. Don't confuse being equal according to law with the lack of any moral judgment. Secondly, we're better as collective, as democracy. 

We as democratic societies have declared universal human rights that are always valid, for every human being regardless of sex, faith, ethnicity or behavior. Can this declaration possibly mean that declaring so will remove all injustice, violence and crime in the world? Of course not. It necessarily has to be a goal to strive for. And we do that by following the rules, no matter how heinous the crime. (I am full of admiration for the way the Norwegian society has dealt with Breivik crimes, because I'm almost certain, and to a degree history shows that, we would not have acted like that.)

&gt; The guy go caught in the act and even confessed. He's not innocent in the slightest.

A principle applies principally: to every case, every time, not just hand-picked convenient examples.

&gt; In a democratic state everyone has the right to a fair trial. 

The right to fair trial is only one of the basic human rights.

&gt; According to you, the Nuremberg trials weren't performed by democratic states.

Just like realizing that woman and black people should be able to vote, the democracy USA has yet to catch up with some fundamental democratic and human rights principles.

Dazu nochmal der Beispielsatz, der zu Testzwecken genommen wurde:  
&gt;Es sollte verboten sein, dass regierungsamtliche Überwachung von E-Mail und Internetkommunikation als Instrument zur Bekämpfung des internationalen Verbrechens und Terrorismus eingesetzt wird.  
  
Und jetzt versucht jeder bitte mal den Inhalt dieses Satzes wiederzugeben. Ich hab so meine Probleme damit. Ich muss den Satz mehrmals lesen, um überhaupt zum Kern vorzudringen. ""Regierungsamtlich"" ist ein Wort, das in meinem Wortschatz bisher nicht vorkam, und auch nur wenig zum Sinn des Satzes beiträgt. Der Satz macht so nicht exakt den gleichen Sinn, und dennoch weiß jeder was gemeint ist:  
&gt; Es sollte verboten sein, dass Überwachung von E-Mail und Internetkommunikation als Instrument zur Bekämpfung des internationalen Verbrechens und Terrorismus eingesetzt wird.   
  
E-Mail und Internetkommunikation. E-Mail IST Internetkommunikation, also wieder ein Begriff, der den Satz stumpf verlängert.  
&gt; Es sollte verboten sein, dass Überwachung von Internetkommunikation als Instrument zur Bekämpfung des internationalen Verbrechens und Terrorismus eingesetzt wird.  

Und jetzt löschen wir noch das ""Instrument"", und ""international"" und wir sind bei:  
&gt; Es sollte verboten sein, dass Überwachung von Internetkommunikation zur Bekämpfung von Verbrechen und Terrorismus eingesetzt wird.

Man merkt sich bei so großen Texten, wie bei dem Original, nicht den genauen Wortlaut. Man merkt sich das Thema, und die eigene Reaktion auf den Satz. Wenn man nun einen Satz sieht, bei dem ein einziges Wort geändert wurde, das zufällig den gesamten Sinn umdreht, fällt das kaum auf.  
  
Dann sind da noch 53% der Testpersonen, die die umgekehrte Meinung als ihre eigene Meinung verteidigten. Da ist ebenfalls der Umfang interessant. Wenn die Durchführer des Experiments einfach nur gefragt haben ""ist das Ihre Meinung?"" und die Testpersonen, je nachdem was sie angekreuzt haben, ""Ja"" oder ""nein"" antworteten, und das den Durchführern als ""Meinungsverteidigung"" reichte, dann ist das was anderes, als wenn die Testpersonen tatsächlich ihre eigenen Argumente vom anfänglichen Erklären umgedreht hätten, um ihre ""neue"" Meinung zu vertreten...",0,1352659997,null,0,false,0,c6zrpzq,t3_130fka,t1_c6zrpzq,t1_c6zqpnt,null,1430378187,6,false,de,t5_22i0,6

b) But yes, according to it, the Nazis shouldn't have been hung. No doubt about that. The death penalty is ethically wrong, so it's wrong in the case of the Nazis, too.

Your statements are quite ironic since putting human beings into different categories meriting different legal standing is exactly what the Nazis did. It's exactly the reason we're now treating the [human dignity as prime directive](http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/GG.htm#1).

I think that it is better to have the B team into regular leagues. It actually helps the players in growing more.
Take barca b for example. They are now at the top of the league an have proven to be strong. The players get to adapt better by playing vs older, more experienced teams rather than 18, 19 and 20 year olds.

In terms of the Villareal B case, I think that it doesn't really matter because even though the players care about the success of the team, they care more about themselves becoming better to make it in the first team.

Not sure if I explained it the best possible way, hope you understand my reasoning.
