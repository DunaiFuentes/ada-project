That's why it worked for Germany. Everyone contributed in proportion to their ability to maintain the needed purchase power for the economy to function. Meanwhile government spending actually decreased. Germany achieved the right balance between cuts and revenue.

In the countries currently going through austerity programs, taxes are taking away too much purchase power; cuts on essential state institutions (education, healthcare, etc.) are making people spend their purchase power on them instead of spending it in the actual economy.

And it can't even be called austerity, because government spending is actually growing. While essential institutions are cut, irresponsible spending driven by corruption and cronyism is rampant. All these cuts on one front and growing expenses on the backs of everyone only exist to satisfy special interests and make friends of politicians wealthier. And the wealthy aren't really contributing. None of their real income is taxed.

And finally, there are no real reforms to signifcantly reduce the size of government and its dependence on these higher taxes (which don't leak to the wealthy, of course).

* * *

If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you a question, which is only tangentially related to your comment. I'm asking you because I'm actually interested to hear what your answer is, for the simple reason that I thought your recent comments in this thread have been very insightful. Anyway, here's the question, or rather the setup for my question. You say:

&gt; The primary discontent goes towards the Greek politicians [...]

I've been trying to follow the Eurocrisis from as many different angles as possible, reading as many politically divergent perspectives as I could find. And because Greece is at the center of the crisis more than any other country, I've been reading quite a number of articles that try to explain why the crisis was so severe in Greece. I also have a number of Greek friends and discussed this topic a few times with them, and finally, I spent a few weeks this summer in Greece. All of this has formed an idea in my mind that seems to go against the statement of yours that I quoted above.

What I'm getting at is this: I can't really speak with much authority on this, but my impression, based on the sources mentioned above, is that a significant part of the current problems of Greece is not just a corrupt political elite (which I'm sure has to carry *some* amount of the blame), but also the customs, habits and  ""mentality"" of ordinary Greek citizens.

To be a bit more precise now, I'll give some examples. I've seen first hand a pretty relaxed attitude of my hosting family (awesome people that I consider real friends, by the way) towards black market labor and illegal employment. I also met a rather high-level state employee (sorry for being so vague, don't want to incriminate anyone), who very nonchalantly told tales of how he evaded problems with the police on several accounts by mentioning to them his rank. Another case: one of my friends, who once told me that he is trying to avoid the whole 'fakellaki' business tried to get his driver's license, but said that in the end, he just gave up doing it the ""morally right"" way after being failed more than once and paid the expected bribe, and finally got the license.

The examples above are not really reducible to corruption in the highest political levels, I believe. They are more of an expression of a generally ""relaxed"" attitude to laws and rules, especially if breaking those laws and rules doesn't hurt any *person* specifically, but only hurts the abstract entity of the *state*.

I live in the Netherlands, and I have seen enough small-time twisting of rules and black labor here as well, but I would say that it seemed more common in Greece, and many people seemed actually sort of *proud* of cheating the system.

Okay, that's been a very long exposition, what I want to ask you is this: 

First, do you agree with my premise, that it appears that the real problem of Greece is not just that Greek politicians (i.e. those in the highest levels of power) are corrupt and selfish, but that there is a larger problem of how the Greek institutions (""institutions"", [in the sociological sense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution)) are at odds with the mindset that is required for a modern democratic capitalist environment?

Second, if you agree with the premise above, what do you think is the best way to change those institutions, and the mentality, of both politicians and of the ""ordinary people""?",0,1349820761,null,0,false,0,c6k2y71,t3_116uuf,t1_c6k2y71,t1_c6jtwsf,null,1430106476,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,Soupias,GREE,Greece,"Ok, first I would like to say that you are right in some aspects. Greek people like to go around the rules if that benefits them. Not all of them. (btw paying to get a driving license does not apply - all the people I know paid nothing to get it) My opinion, and that is not to justify the situation is that Greek people are as corrupt as any other nation. The different levels of corruption between countries is how easy it is for ordinary people to 'bend the rules' for their benefit. If you know that you can do something and get away with it easily then you will probably do it. People need to be scared of the consequences to do the right thing. Unfortunately, very few people will do what is moraly right just because .

Take as an example the person that is giving the driving licenses. It will take a bribe to give you the license or you risk failing. (this is just an example - since you mentioned it) As a public worker, he/she has the benefit of job security. Yes, public workers cannot be fired in Greece even if they do their jobs badly. The worse that can happen is not to get promoted or be transfered somewhere else. And that happens in extreme cases only. So, even he gets caught receiving a bribe, he will not have serious consequences. So he does it without fear. I believe that the same would happen in any other country that has a relaxed law enforcement. If a person from Netherlands comes to live here, he will become corrupt, because, why not? If Greek government is placed in charge of Netherlands then Dutch people will become corrupt. 

Unfortunately having laws is not enough, there has to be competent enforcement because people will not follow them just because it is right. Another simple example is from my friends that live in the UK. They are model drivers there, but when they come to Greece they always drive above the speed limit and never wear seatbelts. Pretty, weird (for me) that they do not understand that safety is important and for everyones benefit and it has to be 'enforced' on them. (I suppose because in the UK you face more serious penalties and you can be caught as there are cameras and more road checks)

So, to answer your question yes, I believe that a portion of the problem is caused from ordinary people bending the rules because the system does not work to keep them in check.",0,1349826135,null,0,false,0,c6k4b1y,t3_116uuf,t1_c6k4b1y,t1_c6k2y71,null,1430107114,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,hseldon10,MEXI,Mexico,"You are raising the point of moral hazard. Of course, the US Federal Government also debated moral hazard when they bailed-out its financial system. 

My counter-point is that you can't expect Germany to behave as the Federal Government of Europe, unless, of course, you want a Europe ruled by Germany. Spain needs to bail out its own banks, but obviously, it doesn't have enough money to do this, so what do they do? They ask for a bailout. I know that, right now, Spain is pretending they don't need a bailout, but you, me, Rajoy, and everyone knows very well that they are not fooling anyone.

If you are implying that, somehow, this is the reason why Germany (or Europe in general) had an obligation to bail out Greece, so that they could in turn bail-out their own banks, as Spain will do, then you are forgetting that Greece and Spain are different countries, with different structural issues. Spain's issue is its medieval banking structure. Greece's issue is government corruption and untrustworthiness. Moral Hazard can take a back seat because the parties involved are not equally trustworthy, nor do their issues reflect similar urgencies: Spain may be better equipped to deal with the financial catastrophe than Greece. After all, Spain does have productive infrastructure.

Which is why I return to my point. There is no ""real"" solution except dismantling the Euro or instituting a centralized Federal Government for Europe. The bailout of Greece, the fiscal tightening, the talk, the posturing, they are all band-aids which won't last long and may make the problems worse. In the mean time, it's the best they've got because no one wants to dismantle the Euro, nor do they want to create a Federal Government. And that's my counter-argument: all debate is pointless without a tracendent, definitive decision.

true,zxz242,UKRA,Ukraine,"An intellectual variant of Fascism would be the very first movement, prior to 1934 - when Italian Fascism was molested by Catholic influence and finances, forcing the system to adopt right-wing social policy.

An intellectual Fascism is a self-aware Fascism, one that is capable of revisionism, in order to survive and adapt. No support from the people, as Oswald Mosley put it, means no movement.



I'm sure you know that Fascism was started by former Marxists and supporters of Georges Sorel (founder of Anarcho-Syndicalism).

They combined Sorelian Syndicalism, along with his idea of Direct Action, and merged it with Nationalism; at the time, it meant having the state as a ""religious ideal"" (""the state"" representing both the citizens of the country and the legal idea of the country itself - which was necessary when you have a country full of uneducated farmers, it was an idea founded during WW1, after all), creating something called National Syndicalism.

The National Syndicalists were actually very progressive in terms of Social Policy, and presented a Syncretic combination of Left-wing and Right-wing ideas. In the split that occurred in 1934, many of them were expelled.

Leftist Fascists include: 
- Michele Bianchi
- Angelo Oliviero Olivetti (a Jew) 
- Sergio Panunzio (opposed antisemitism)
- Edmondo Rossoni (sentenced to death by Mussolini for voting against him)



Here's my point: The Golden Dawn is reactionary, not innovative, and very conservative; something that National Syndicalism did not support.

I'm not going to write an essay here, but I assure you that elements of Fascism (like any transitional socioeconomic system) such as Class Collaboration, Corporatism (not Corporatocracy; which is the rule of the state BY Corporations, not a state enterprise that runs like a Corporation), and the culture of Athleticism and Will-power, especially the embrace of the Highest-Common Denominator of our species, are extremely necessary and must be reviewed, considered and applied to Western social and economic policies.",0,1349829788,null,0,false,0,c6k57in,t3_11744d,t1_c6k57in,t1_c6k2i3b,null,1430107544,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Wales and Northern Ireland are hardly on the verge of secession- it's not about to set off a domino effect. The main thing that mildly concerns me's the disproportionate number of non-Tory MPs that might go with Scotland- living in a country significantly more likely to end up with a Conservative government's not terribly appealing, as prospects go.

But even then- the number of Labour governments formed over the past fifty years wouldn't have varied all that much had Scotland not contributed its usual crop of MPs. It might not make all that much of a difference at all.

It'd be a tremendous shame to see Scotland go- even disregarding the centuries of shared culture, the wonderful flag and, honestly, the damned fine people, it's a wonderful place in itself. But it's simply not a matter for the rest of the country (particularly the English) to decide. Everybody recognises that- and everybody worth listening to's absolutely fine with it. The most venomous any split would be likely to get's the odd vocal article in the *Daily Mail* - a paper I'm sure the Scots would do very well without. 

Frankly, if most of the country north of the Midlands were to be given the option to secede with Scotland, the chances are it would- so long as Scotland's government came with the bargain. Scotland's political climate's so much more in tune with the sentiments of the (urban) country north of the English South- a situation accentuated by the current government, if anything.

true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"I can't comment on the CROUS (it doesn't have a very good reputation as far as efficiency of the administration is concerned). However, a few bits :

- rent will probably be your biggest concern. You are probably eligible to the APL aid (Aide Personalisée au Logement) which can pay as much as half of your rent.

- I know Grenoble, I lived in Meylan a bit. Know that Grenoble is small, you can walk accross the city easily in one hour or less, so don't worry if you find an appartment that is far from your university. Also know that the town is very flat (people are usually surprised about this, given it is in the alps) but a bike is **very** convenient in Grenoble. There are non-profits that will help you get one for very cheap (15-30 euros) 

- You are probably eligible to the students healthcare too. Phone to a ""CPAM : Caisse Primaire d'Assurance Maladie"" or even go there. There are sometimes assholes but most of the time I have found helpful people. They will tell you what you need to do. Also, this is France, expect contradictions between what person A will tell you and what person B will. Check crucial informations, make copies of your important documents, phone to an administration when a procedure takes too long, they may have lost the file.

- public healthcare is decent, but if your meds are expensive, try to find out if they are 100% reimbursed by the ""sécu"", otherwise, you can find an inexpensive complementary insurance (called ""mutuelle"") usually students get very interesting discounts on these.

- In case of emergency, you can always go to a public hospital. They will cure you first, and worry about insurance later. In most case, your situation can be cleared later, health (in public hospitals) is usually not a racket like it sometimes seem to be in US.

- As a EU student, you can work in France. I am not sure however how the taxes work, but again, the tax office is usually very helpful if you phone them they will tell you. However, I remember that there is a cap where they simply do not care. Student jobs won't make them control you. If you want to earn more money, ""auto-entrepreneur"" is a very easy status to get and will allow you to earn up to 32k€ per year (with a 20% tax rate)

- This is a very personal opinion, so discard it at will, but I would only make a loan as a last resort. Run out of your 2000 euros first, find a small job at one of the numerous restaurants downtown, find small jobs as baby-sitter, guitar teacher, english conversation, etc... but bank loans make it harder to come back as positive. It will be easier to find a boss who agrees to give you a salary a bit earlier than to find an honest banker in France.

- If it comes to that, expulsion of people from flats are forbidden in winter, so it can buy you some time, and student solidarity *does* exist. So if you reach the point where it is hard for you to buy food or rent, friends may be able to help you.

* About the Uni campus, from what I've read, Grenoble Universities (incl. Stendhal to which I am applying) are located just outside Grenoble? I can't exactly figure that out, France seems to divide land in a different way than what I am used to. Maybe it's still within a cycling distance?

* This is related to the student solidarity part, and since you have lived in Grenoble you probably can answer this: How accepting are the locals? I currently live in a really racist country and since a little kid I was afraid that I'll get that kind of treatment abroad. I know that the French probably won't care about me being an atheist, but what about being a foreigner, or gay?

About the loan, I really wish I could avoid it. Actually, maybe I can if I try hard.

It's been said already but... 

If you're worried about money, you should apply for a student accommodation in a Crous Residence. It's  not guaranteed that they will grant you accommodation but if they do then take it ! It's cheap, cheaper that the private renting market, you'll be close to your university (hopefully) and it great for student life.

Either way you should contact the bureau for international students, because they will help you with all the administrative procedures. 

These [two](http://www.crous-grenoble.fr/article-105-mg-5-mh-22-ms-1-international-students.htm) [links](http://www.crous-grenoble.fr/article-36-mg-5-mh-163-ms-1-etudiants-individuels.htm) should be where you start.

A friend of mine came to Grenoble in pretty much the same situation (broke). She worked a few evenings a week for a bar in the city center and she was paid ""under the table"" because she was Brazilian. I just you being european allows you to work officially in France but if you can't find that there's always the unofficial possibility. (Also, check that if you work over the table that might reduce your APL, not sure about it but it's a possibility).

You should look into the ""bourse sur critères sociaux"". There are criteria for non-french students but you might be eligible now or further down the road if you really stay 3 years. 

And now to give you you an idea of the money one spend being a student far from home. I studied in Tours for 3 years. I took a 7200€ loan to pay my rent : my rent was 340€ (Tours is a cheaper city to live in than Grenoble), I got 160€ APL so my final rent was less than 200€. My parents gave me 200€ a month and I would spend between 100 and 200€ more from my savings : that would cover bills (electricity, internet, phone...), foods, train tickets to go back to Paris, social outings... 

Last but not least. You won't get any trouble for being atheist, quite the opposite. About being gay, it's a bit less simple. I don't believe you'll suffer from outward homophobia but even if France is quite progressive everybody might not welcome you and your homosexuality with open arms. Lots of people haven't encountered gay people before and the 18yo boys you'll be studying with might need some time to get used to the idea. What I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't worry about that coming to France but the country as a whole is very accepting, but you shouldn't expect individuals (especially young ones) to be whole-heartedly accepting, or dismissing it as no big deal in the first few minutes of the announcement. You should just be careful, but I'm sure you'll find we're much more accepting than in Cyprus.

And my final final line will be that if you're really worried about money, you should know that some cities are cheaper than Grenoble. ",0,1349854850,null,0,false,0,c6kagjw,t3_118axu,t1_c6kagjw,t3_118axu,null,1430110086,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

This isn't true. They're gambling with their wealth every new crisis cycle. Some get bailed out because they're 'too big to fail', but others jump out of windows.

Nowadays, taxing the wealthy and preventing them from evading taxes would be quite simple. All transactions are computerized. Automatic taxes on transactions would be highly effective and go where the untaxed money really ends up.

As you most certainly know, there are plans to do this on a EU level, but it should also be done individually by each state.

Of course, there's the myth that they will flee to paradise and invest there. But your comment, even though it's defeatist, it hints at the solution. This is a problem of habits. Thus, the solution consists in changing the norm. Let the norm be taxes on all transactions throughout the (civilized) world and the problem is definitely solved.

As for reducing government without sacrificing the basics it goes hand in hand with this change of norms and habits. Governments should have one sole objective: stability. What is stability? It's making sure everyone can at the very minimum invest in the economy enough to live a free life with access to all democratic venues. That means governments must make sure the basics are accessible to everyone so that people can spend what they earn on the actual economy. 

Stability will keep the wealthy wealthy and will make the poor come out of poverty. A few millions in taxes in exchange for stability is a great deal for any smart wealthy person throughout the (civilized) world. And knowing you go to work to earn money that you can invest on your freedom is the greatest motivation for productivity.",0,1349854892,null,0,false,0,c6kagpw,t3_116uuf,t1_c6kagpw,t1_c6kaav8,null,1430110087,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

So either the janitor has to clean out the bin, or somebody has to arrange for a special pick-up. This gets pretty costly if it happens more then once in a while.

Defining globalisation as a process that tears down borders, that enables players to move beyond and live with more ressources of any kind available, that provides more freedom and choices, and democracy further as a state where players have equal and guaranteed rights to pursue and accomplish individual development I can not see how those may be mutually exclusive.

National sovereignity on the other hand implies a power of an entity over a nation which may be defined by territory, people or language.

To take a shortcut here, democracy and national sovereignity are in fact mutually exclusive.
The ""nation"" has only been constantly losing more and more rights to govern over the past centuries. Rights have been being transferred away from that national sovereign for the benefit of individuals. That is how we define democracy. No occurrance in history did sustainably reverse that trend. Discussing how to strengthen and calling for a revival of national sovereignity is pointless.

Or, to put it more dramatic, democracy itself is killing national sovereignity.

The author makes a few good points, his article, however, lacks a clear defintion of the term globalisation. Globalisation is not a new occurrance. Throughout the history of mankind, we have been expanding and discovering new territories. It's part of life's nature, it's what life does.

It just turns out that this man-made abstract layer, that is a national sovereign, is not fit to adjust to that tempo since human rights are being harmed.

Finance is a real part of the economy and we are all directly involved in it is some way - often via pension funds. Investment strategies are real and vary between people, these people make judgement calls on the future perceived value of a company and that value may alter their position on a variety of things. As a result they may want to hedge their investments to limit losses or do a whole host of things that are routinely done in ""real"" businesses.

For example, if you wish to hedge your bets about how much of a product you can sell you may only produce a few hundred units at first but have the capacity to produce thousands if it sells well. Finance has similar concepts.

Because you do not see a benefit for the ""real economy"" does not necessarily mean one does not exist. 

EDIT: an investment will boost real production through providing liquidity to investors. To take a contrived example lets say an investor invests in startup companies (venture capital) and sells out once they reach a certain size. If the investor is unable to sell his shares and realise his gains then he will not be able to invest in startup companies.

Equally, for FTSE companies if an investor needs to sell an asset - or wants to buy one because he thinks it will provide a better return than sticking it in a bank account - then liquidity is important.",0,1349866317,null,0,false,0,c6kbg7v,t3_1179eh,t1_c6kbg7v,t1_c6kb5l3,null,1430110549,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The law puts the religious freedoms of the parents above the babys right to an unscathed body. This isn't only against the German constitution, it's also ethically wrong to let parents force their religion onto their completely oblivious baby in such an intimate and permanent manner. Taking away (or not granting as in this case) special privileges from religions is not stifling religious freedom, it's equalizing the rights of everyone. 

To use the often rather backwards US culture as an example for anything relevant to Germany is just silly.

The circumcision ban would be a cut to the religious freedom. With this draft everyone can have their sons circumcised (with or without religious background). Which ""de facto"" was the case before the ban.

The US-Example was just to clearify, that you don't need any religious background to get your son circumcised. I don't get your point about my ""rationale"".

When I was in third grade or so, I was taught how to sort the waste according to colours.

We also had several field trips to teach us about being responsible about our environment.

I had never really been *aware* of recycling, it came automatically to me, because, if there are different containers for different kinds of waste, I just stop thinking and seperate the trash accordingly. 

My recycling skills pretty much died in S.Korea. We just leave the plastic bottles and paper outside for the old women to pick up and resell (there are a few from the post-war generation that make a living out of this).

Back to Austria. It might be important to mention that at that time, the Green party was very popular in my town. It could be that they reinforced the pro-recycling mindset. Moreover, recycling is kind of trendy right now.

**EDIT:** Oh yeah, there was this contest recently where students had to think of ways to save energy and/or be environmentally friendly. I think that there was a price money of about 200 Euros.

That's the point. At which point it is unnecessary? An (very simple) example: Families with high numbers of phimosis tend to have their sons circumcised. If this draft goes through, the doctors operation have the legal security to perform the circumcision. This only gets about 2-3% of the german children though. Is this unnecessary? Parants with children who got phimosis may relate to this... it's no joke.

As for the religious motivated circumcision: the religious circumcision is mainly based on hygiene standards. children (and grown ups) in the early muslim countries had much less difficulties with diseases around the sweet spot. Bases around nowadays hygiene standards, the circumcision may be exaggerated, but it's proven that it helps to prevent cervical cancer, and you get much lower STD infections.

Okay, now *you* listen. I read the entire Norwegian state budget every single year. I know it better than most. The Ministry of Finance's section *specifically* talks about this. It is done that way to actually be able to compare the country's data to other countries, because oil revenues create an anomaly that makes data -- like productivity and per capita income -- completely useless. If you want to know the productivity of a hairdresser or programmer you can't add $10k on top of their income.

Canada might do it that way but we don't. Oil revenues are highly volatile and screws up metrics for the vast majority of laborers. The econometrical data usually talks about all of Norway or mainland Norway. The latter is usually what is used unless something else is specified. For instance, when measuring the growth in the economy, mainland Norway is what is talked about. High mainland growth but increasing oil prices would create the impression that we're doing well when we don't.

I'm not an economist, but I can call one and confirm everything I've said. Or I can drop it, since every economist I've ever talked to in Norway knows it and have confirmed it time and time again.

Anyway, I was once wearing the jacket at an airport in the US.  It was one of those airports where the passenger brings their luggage to the check-in counter, the airline attaches a label, and then the passenger has to bring it to the TSA idiots at a separate luggage security scanning area.  The TSA guy looked at the logo on my jacket and said ""That's a cool name"". I was hungover and didn't really understand what he meant, so I just walked away, but I assume he then looked at my luggage label because I heard him say, very unhappily, ""Hey, that guy's name isn't Jack Wolfskin at all!""",0,1349881165,null,0,false,0,c6kdtny,t3_118uqn,t1_c6kdtny,t3_118uqn,null,1430111668,10,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,10

Sorry, this might sound a bit cruel/off: The problem with circumcision with 15 year old is the very simple: noone will do it. A 15 year old boy knows pretty much everything about sexuality and how his penis works (*nudge nudge*) so I don't believe anyone will go through this. Which leads to ""So, it's okay to do this on a baby, but not to an 15 year old"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we might not have a single papar on  traumata generated by circumcision on newborns. The reason why circumcisions where performed as soon as possible because it was considered much less painfull to the child, if done at a very early stage. This is a very complicated issue we have here, as there are researches stating that pain ""consumed"" at very young age can cause traumata etc... An other research states, that the healing process (e.g. after a circumcision) is much faster for younger children than 15 year olds... 
but I'm not really sure what to think in this matter.

As for the numbing: sure. Historical circumcisions had no numbing because... well... there were no real anesthetization methods for children.

Nope, they already learnt that in their families, either *en passant* or implicit learning. 

I get a trash calendar/manual every year with all the dates when special trash will be fetched. There are also the rules given which waste belongs in which trash bin. 

However, recycling/waste separation in households is not that complicated, so it can easily be learnt. Additionally, we have huge instruction labels on our trash bins with an bullet list of allowed stuff. 

However, some companies have special waste (oil, fat, dye, electronics etc.) that requires special treatment. Those companies offer trainings some times.

true,IamNotKarlMarx,null,null,"Sorry that I have to be *that* guy but 136 WRV (incorporated via Art. 140 GG) is not (contrary to the wording, I give you that) a limit to Art. 4 GG! I  try to explain:

There are basically 3 different types of basic rights (Grundrechte) in the GG.

1. basic rights with a reservation (Gesetzesvorbehalt) see e.g. Art. 2 I GG which can be restricted using any (proportionate (verhältnismäßiges) law 
2. basic rights with a qualified reservation. See Art. 5 I which can be restricted using any general (allgemein) law (some additional requirements for the law to be constitutional but not really relevant to this topic)
3. unconditional basic rights. An example is Art. 5 III (Wissenschaftsfreiheit - freedom of academics).

The latter have very high requirements for any law (or (criminal) court ruling) to restrict them.
Art. 4 GG does not feature a provision that this right can be restricted by a law. But there are some people that use Art. 136 WRV as a (in my examples type 1.) restriction to Art. 4 GG but the **main legal opinion and the rulings of the Bundesverfassungsgericht** do not accept Art. 136 WRV as a restriction to Art. 4. This is obviously a difficult question and controversial since the beginning of the Bundesrepublik but I can assure you that the BVerfG won't use your argument in this case ;-)

So we have a basic right that is unconditionally granted. This means we can only take other basic rights into consideration if we want to limit the religious rights. Luckily we have the right to physical integrity, Art. 2 II of the baby.

I don't want to solve this case (since I could write a dissertation about that) but in every case you have to decide for or against one basic right. If you go and outlaw circumcision the right to religious expression is severely restricted, the other way around and the right to physical integrity is restricted. As I said no easy answer and you certainly won't solve this with ARt. 136 WRV!

One last point: You also have to take into consideration that the government (in the american way (also: der Staat)) is not in a position to tell the parents what's good for their children or not. Art. 6 II makes clear that the government is only a ""guardian"" for the children and not the descisionmaker! A point often forgotten in this debate!

true,Intelensprotient,GERM,Germany,"The issue isn't either whiteness OR muslimness. It is a matter of deteriorating social standards due to growing ghettos, poverty and perspectivelessness. Yes, in Europe, that often describes the living standards especially of Muslim immigrants, and by no means it's only society's fault. It's a complicated connection between a huge amount of socioeconomic factors, some of which are to blame on society as a whole, some on the government, some on their heritage and some on the immigrants (and especially their parents) themselves.

By no means I want to apologize for the latter, but they are living here (and in France, with even more right than in the rest of Europe) and they are here to stay. And no human being is inherently incapable of ethical behavior - after all, other than morals, ethics is based on pure and true logics. But the conditions under which this behavior is exhibited simply are not present in these cases.

You are likely familiar with Maslow's Pyramid of Needs, which clarifies that people are unlikely to behave in accordance to ethical standards if they are in economic or emotional distress. Exactly this is the problem here, and it is a worldwide one and not necessarily connected to immigration. Just look at the US's 'inner city youths' - they can hardly be described as immigrants themselves, but they exhibit largely the same kind of behavior. Or take Saxony's local nationalist groups - they, as well, suffer from an environment which gives them no perspectives at all, so they beat up those who they blame for said environment.

Keep in mind that these are young people, whose personality was likely formed under these exact conditions.

true,Oda_Krell,EURO,"German, living in the Netherlands","Yes, I knew I forgot a very important point in my already way-too-long comment: I don't believe for one second that (for example) Dutch people are somehow *inherently* more or less corrupt than, say, Greek people. I completely agree with your analysis: move a Dutch person to a country with laxer rule-enforcement, and he will adapt to the dominant culture there. Move a Greek person to a stricter rule-enforced place, and he will adapt as well.

That's why I said in my comment that the problems are the social institutions of a country, i.e. the cumstoms and habits, the interpretation and enforcement of laws, the public *perception* of the interpretation and enforcement of laws, and so on.

The problem seems to be though that, for a while now, a number of countries and regions of Europe seem to be unable to *change* their institutions significantly (and, obviously, in this Greece is not alone -- there are regions in Germany that suffer from similar problems). And from a completely neutral viewpoint, I can understand why it is difficult to change: if the *current* culture favors taking advantage of lax rule enforcement by ignoring or bending rules, then any individual who *obeys* the rules nonetheless acts against his own, personal best interest. So you can't easily expect him/her to make this first step that essentially would be a sacrifice.

I don't want to sound completely pessimistic, but I guess it just appears to me that to change the political/economical/social culture of a country, you need to change the mindset of the population. But the mindset of the population is strongly influenced by its political/economical/social culture. So it seems like a feedback loop that cannot easily be broken. Maybe it can be changed with the help of outside influence, but that is not much appreciated by Greece at the moment, and given how crude for example Germany by and large acted, that's understandable. Or perhaps there can be change if the initial impulse is given by a particularly influential and charismatic group or individual, but neither of those seems to be on the horizon -- Samaras doesn't strike me as particularly charismatic, and Tsipras is perhaps charismatic enough, but doesn't seem to understand, or admit, what the real problem is.",0,1349886044,null,0,false,0,c6kf8tr,t3_116uuf,t1_c6kf8tr,t1_c6k4b1y,null,1430112337,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

In order to save the Euro, there needs to be a Federal European Government. When is that gonna happen? NEVER! So why not just drop the pretense and stop using the Euro? It costs less if its done sooner rather than later and Germany is in a better position to minimize the fallout locally.

Dropping the Euro is the best logical thing to Germany's best interests. But it would collapse the rest of Euro-area (with the possible exception of France). That's why Greece got a bailout, to protect other Euro countries. It heavily affected every single Euro country, and none more so than Germany. And the cause was that Greece acted irresponsibly. So, yes, Greece should be held to a high standard of fiscal responsibility if it wants a bail out. It screwed Europe with the bailout, so it should pay.

Some Muslim immigrants admit their bias quite openly. An Islamic Mufti in Copenhagen sparked a political outcry after publicly declaring that women who refuse to wear headscarves are ""asking for rape."" Apparently, he's not the only one thinking this way. “It is not as wrong raping a Swedish girl as raping an Arab girl,” says Hamid. “The Swedish girl gets a lot of help afterwards, and she had probably fucked before, anyway. But the Arab girl will get problems with her family. For her, being raped is a source of shame. It is important that she retains her virginity until she marries.” It was no coincidence that it was a Swedish girl that was gang raped in Rissne – this becomes obvious from the discussion with Ali, Hamid, Abdallah and Richard. All four have disparaging views on Swedish girls, and think this attitude is common among young men with immigrant background. “It is far too easy to get a Swedish whore…… girl, I mean;” says Hamid, and laughs over his own choice of words. “Many immigrant boys have Swedish girlfriends when they are teenagers. But when they get married, they get a proper woman from their own culture who has never been with a boy. That’s what I am going to do. I don’t have too much respect for Swedish girls. I guess you can say they get fucked to pieces.

""The Whore Lived Like a German""

In the past four months, six Muslim women living in Berlin have been brutally murdered by family members. Their crime? Trying to break free and live Western lifestyles. Within their communities, the killers are revered as heroes for preserving their family dignity. How can such a horrific and shockingly archaic practice be flourishing in the heart of Europe? The deaths have sparked momentary outrage, but will they change the grim reality for Muslim women?

In Oslo all sexual assaults involving rape in the past year. Have been committed by males of non-western background. This was the conclusion of a police report published today. Where the rapist could be identified, he was a man of foreign origin.

A jury in Canada has found three members of an Afghan family guilty of drowning three teenage sisters and another woman in what the judge described as ""cold-blooded, shameful murders"" resulting from a ""twisted concept of honour"". The verdicts concludes a case that shocked Canadians.

Prosecutors said the defendants killed the three teenage sisters because they felt they had dishonored the family by defying its strict rules on dress, dating, socializing and using the internet.

Regarding the massacre, sure, we could go on for hours talking about how the US allowed slavery and Indian massacres into the 19th century, the British invented the concentration camp, the Swedes practiced state-sanctioned eugenics well into the 20th century, the Czechs killed ethnic Germans after WWII, etc. - but the nazi crimes are in a pretty spectacular league with few peers, like those of the Soviets under the holodomor, the Chinese under the cultural revolution, the Khmer Rouge, and a few others in modern history.  There are not many ""massacres"" that you can really compare it to.  

But how many Germans alive today participated in them?  Were even alive when they happened?  Support/excuse/justify them?  Not a whole lot.  So yeah, the ""lol, Germany, nazis"" thing is pretty fucking dumb.

If you masturbate (and is male) I hope you understand that every sperm holds the *potential* to be a human being, and you are wasting/murdering them, by masturbating. Just like a fetus, it can't survive outside of your body, so hold it in there, until you can meet a woman who wants your sperm.

Actually, I don't. I am in favour of the right to abortion. Surprised? I deliberately avoided stating my position, because I wanted to discuss specific points open-mindedly. As usually, you made assumptions anyway. People will take the slightest hint as to which ""side"" you are on, so that you can be labelled and have your opinions conveniently stereotyped. Because a person holding one view cannot possibly recognize there also exist arguments against it...

Anyway. It's all about the status of a fetus. If someone believes it is a human being, then it's irrelevant how much they empathize with woman's right to control her own body - because protecting human life is more important. Now, that person may be *wrong*, but it still doesn't make them anti-women. Anti [means ""opposed to something""](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anti). 
How can you be anti-women if your position isn't in any way motivated by their attitude towards women and only affects them incidentally? If you have to judge between A and B, both of which you care about, and mistakenly choose in favour of A, it doesn't make you anti-B - it just makes you wrong.

Si tu avais lu l'article que tu me lies, tu saurais que la grande majorité (environ 80%) des liquidités empruntées à 1% auprès de la BCE ont été replacées auprès de cette même BCE à 0.5%. Il s'agit donc d'une opération où les banques font globalement des pertes. C'est par contre une nécessité pour elles en raison de la mise en place brutales de nouvelles exigences réglementaires au niveau européen en terme de liquidité. En gros, ces nouvelles règles imposent que tu ais de très fortes liquidités disponibles à horizon 1 mois et bientôt 1 an. Décidé à Bruxelles, le planning ne permettait pas aux banques de répondre à la législation en urgence. Étant donné que les législateurs ont donné des instructions débiles, la BCE a été obligé d'intervenir. Si on avait des législateurs qui connaissaient un peu mieux nos banques, ça irait mieux...

&gt; Encore une fois, je veux bien la liste de ces raisons.

Typiquement le déport du risque de crédit de la BCE sur les banques : si un état n'arrive pas à rembourser, ce ne sera pas porté sur la BCE, mais sur les banques. C'est un risque qu'elles prennent et donc qu'elles facturent. Cela permet de donner de la sûreté et de l'indépendance à la BCE.

Second the Trojan is ILLEGAL. That is old news. The police just did not care and created one illegaly. Nobody was punished (THAT is the problem). 

Monitoring chat is more difficult (no laws here), but since chating is done via Internet via telecommunication laws they are proably allowed to listen in on chat the way they do with telephones/skype (need consent of a judge).

Monitoring Google Mail is illegal/impossible.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;f someone believes it is a human being, then it's irrelevant how much they empathize with woman's right to control her own body - because protecting human life is more important.

No, that is not right either. Even among anti- abortonist there are nuances. A lot of people (in Poland as well, as you can see elsewhere in the thread) who are against abortions, they are not against *all* abortions. For example, women/children who has been raped or when a womans life is in danger are the two usual ones they think are allowed to have abortions. 

So, you are stating that they think protecting human life is more important. No, they don't, just sometimes, when they think it is convenient. That actually make them a lot more anti-woman, than people who are against abortions at any costs. If they truly cared about the fetus, they wouldn't mind the 11 year old girl who had been raped by her uncle giving birth. 

So, they are not just wrong (which might be a philosofical/moral statement), they are definately taking a stance against womens right. The fact that those who are against abortion sometimes are trying to hide it by saying they care about life is hypocracy.

Yes; controlled - as best we can - for conflating factors there's still an issue. You do know that fact don't you, so shall we not pretend there's not something odd to address and instead shall we try to address it?

Let's both try to be honest here, and do better than racists and PC-liberals, both of whom are utterly unhelpful.

&gt;*please tell me why these debates are always only about them, and not all the other factors that also matters*

All my life I've listened to debates about poverty and social deprivation and its links to crime. Where have you been that you've never come across those debates? 

&gt;*Also, the culture obviously does not Promote such behaviour. There is a different between promoting and not condemning*

There's a matter of degree but you've gone a bit further than I have. Obviously some members of the community publicly condemn the criminal behaviour of a minority; I think, though, that the contemporary culture of Islam *does* promote such behaviour. I don't mean they take out adverts on the sides of buses urging 'youths' to rape; but in promoting a view of human sexuality that sees men as hardly able to control themselves if presented with an un-veiled woman; with a role-model who consummated marriage to a girl aged 9; with a disregard for women that counts them as second-rate; then I think it *does* promote the attitudes that culminate, in the extreme, in this sort of behaviour.

&gt;*When a non-white does it, we see it as a direct casuation of them being non-white*

You're confusing a few things. Probably deliberately. Firstly, I'm talking about the contemporary culture of Islam, not any *race*. Secondly, nobody can plausibly suggest, and nobody tries to suggest, a causal link between being white and school shootings. 

On the other hand, I *can* suggest a plausible causal connection between a contemporary view of women in Islam and violence towards women. Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Theo van Gogh [**made a film about it**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submission_(2004_film).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;My argument isn't valid only in case of the ""absolute"" position, I just used it in my argument it for the sake of simplicity.

What? I go to university, I am sure I understand more complex issues. Please humour me by explaining that women are not primarily affected by anti abortion laws? Please explain to me how a fetus all of a sudden is not a *Homo sapiens*, which I most certainly agree to that it is (but I draw the line at persons, and I do not see fetuses that can't survive outside of a womb as persons, but the cells are *Homo sapiens*). Either it is life, or it is not. Biologically speaking anti-abortionists are wrong by the way. The biological definition of life is ""to have your own metabolism (which every cell in us have), thus, viruses are not life in the biological sense, but fetuses are, and the fetus cells clearly belongs to *Homo sapiens*.



&gt;An anti-abortionist might believe a fetus isn't quite the same as a human being, but nevertheless holds significant value and possesses inalienable rights.

That is not what I see in this thread, nor what you have argued for. Every one cell of our cells (apart from red blood cells I believe) contains our DNA and holds the potential for life, so either they do not understand simple biology, or they are (which I belive) using the definition of ""life"", when it suits them, from a moral position, that has nothing to do with actually respecting life. 

I can honestly understand those 7 %, the rest are hypocrites. 

&gt;The principle stays the same, it's still weighing one right against another, and choosing A doesn't mean you are anti-B.

Yes, you are, and I will begin with giving you an example. If I choose to be pro death penalty (A), it does mean that I am not against the death penalty (B). Anti-abortion laws are against womens right, thus you are against women's right if you are against free abortion. The anti abortionist might want to dress it up a bit, in some sort of fancy ""I am just pro life"", but as I have statistically shown you, that is bullshit and applies to 7 % of the Polish population. 


Oh, here are some statistic that proves my point that you are anti women if you do not want free abortion. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_abortion). 20 000 000 illegal abortions every year, most of them in countries where it is not legal. 68 000 of them die every year.

WHO have called for legal abortions everywhere, since they see the consequences of the illegal ones, and considers it a womans issue. I'd like you to explain to me why WHO are wrong, and it is not that? You claim that anti abortionist do not think it is a women's issue, but WHO does not see it that way. What are you seeing that the WHO  don't?

Islam has a history of discrimination and persecution of homosexuals and women. And while the shaming of homosexuals is wrong and disturbing in some Western states I would much rather be shamed than stoned to death or hung. The act of a few extremists?

Here is a video documenting the execution of two young gay men in Iran. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL_zP2pHp3w&amp;feature=related http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Execution_of_two_gay_teens_in_Iran_spurs_controversy

In Saudi Arabia, sodomy is punishable by death. I won't even get into the stoning of women for adultery,or the forced marriages of pre pubescent girls, but it will suffice to say that when it comes to the treatment of women and homosexuals there is no comparison to Islam. And it is not a few crazy extremists. It is governmental policy for many if not most Islamic countries to treat women as second class citizens.

Here are things that Muslims do to women that I think are worse than murder.

true,gocarsno,POLA,Poland,"&gt; Please humour me by explaining that women are not primarily affected by anti abortion laws?

I never said they aren't.

&gt;  Please explain to me how a fetus all of a sudden is not a Homo sapiens, which I most certainly agree to that it is (but I draw the line at persons, and I do not see fetuses that can't survive outside of a womb as persons, but the cells are Homo sapiens).

They are Homo Sapiens but that's a biological category. Moral status is a different, though related, issue.

&gt; Either it is life, or it is not.

I don't think anyone would deny it is a life. The question is: what kind of life? Clearly, not all kinds of life have the same rights.


&gt; Yes, you are, and I will begin with giving you an example. If I choose to be pro death penalty (A), it does mean that I am not against the death penalty (B).

These are direct opposites, one is simple a negation of the other - this is not the kind of alternative we're talking about. In our case we have (A) woman's right to make decisions about her body and (B) fetus's right to live. They are not opposites, you can support them both in general. But they happen, tragically, to be mutually exclusive in the particular situation and you have to make a choice. And even though you very much value A, you value B even more, so you choose B. Depending on your opinion on the moral status of fetus, your choice may go the other way.

&gt; WHO have called for legal abortions everywhere, since they see the consequences of the illegal ones, and considers it a womans issue. I'd like you to explain to me why WHO are wrong, and it is not that?

Again, I've never said it's not a women's issue. The problem is, it's also a fetus's issue.

It's late and I honestly don't have the energy to carry on, so I'm gonna stop playing devil's advocate. If you'd like to know my  personal opinion, here it is. 

I believe fetus is not a human being, but it still has significant worth and possesses some rights. It is more than a ""tumour"" or a ""parasite"". When a pregnancy is unwanted, you have to balance fetus's rights with woman's rights. There are all sort of situations and it's impossible for the law to account for every case - the law has to be clear and simple, whereas morality is very complex, not to mention subjective. Therefore, the law will always be an imperfect approximation of morality, a compromise. So let's separate the two issues: what the morality is and what the law should be.

I think the law should allow women to choose, both because it results in a better approximation of morality in most cases and for pragmatic reasons, i.e. illegal abortions taking place anyway, resulting in death of *both* the fetus and the woman. However, it doesn't mean I personally condone abortion in every case, just because the woman chooses it. Let me give you some examples.

1) If woman's health or life is endangered, or if she was raped, or if the child has a genetic disease - I completely support an abortion. I think it is heroic to keep the child, I know I couldn't do it.

2) If the parents neglected contraception, but they are very young or poor and can't give the child the kind of upbringing it deserves - I don't condemn an abortion but I believe it's admirable to keep the child and gives up the child for adoption a'la Juno. Perhaps this kind of selflessness should be encouraged.

3) If the parents are mature, financially stable, and generally able to raise a child, and they stupidly have a quickie without a condom - I don't think they have a moral right to abort. It's their fault and their responsibility. It's not fair that you now have to raise a child for 18+ years because of a moment of carelessness - it's tragic. But morality isn't defined by what's easy.

These are just rough examples. In reality, there is an infinite number of situations and each must be judged individually. We can promote certain morality, more favourable either towards fetus's rights or woman's rights so as to influence women in their decisions. But, as I said, the law should allow women to choose.",0,1349913784,null,0,1349914192,0,c6kn76f,t3_1194dx,t1_c6kn76f,t1_c6klkrq,null,1430116174,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Yes, you have pointed out that it is not.

&gt;Again, I've never said it's not a women's issue. 

Well, you said that people who are against abortions are not anti - women. I have proved, statistically, that they are hypocrites, and that it is a true concern about women's health. That anti abortionist choose not to adress that doesn't make them less anti-women. Statistically, they are against women. So, if you are up to it, I'd like for you to explain to me how they are not anti-women? Truly, the statistic do not lie, WHO do not lie so I'd love to hear your explanation. Just because they do not see themselves as anti women doesn't mean that they are not (the Talibans think they are treating women in the right way too). 

 How can people against free abortion *not* be against women's issues, if they take a look at the statistic. The statistic do not lie, if you are against abortions, you are against not only a womans right to decide over her own body, but pro illegal abortions and pro death. Statistically, at least. Since most of them are OK with pro abortion anyway, when *they* choose, they are hypocrites, and I truly despise such people. 

&gt;These are direct opposites, one is simple a negation of the other - this is not the kind of alternative we're talking about.

Yes, anti abortion *is* the direct opposite of womens right, at least according to statistic and the WHO. That you do not want to see it that way, doesn't mean that it isn't. 

&gt;I think the law should allow women to choose, both because it results in a better approximation of morality in most cases and for pragmatic reasons, i.e. illegal abortions taking place anyway, resulting in death of both the fetus and the woman.

Good to know, and I am glad to hear it.

I am very much pro abortion too, but I guess you had already guessed that :-). It doesn't mean that I would have one myself, but I think it is extremely important that women are given the right to choose. 

Honestly, this make me not want to go to Poland, the Poles are stepping right back into the middle ages, they clearly do not care about women's rights at all. Poor Polish women, now they will have to resort to either being rich and have a safe one abroad, or  if they happen to be so careless that they are not rich, having a dirty abortion in a cellar. Seriously Poland, fuck you (aimed at Poland, not you).

true,will_holmes,UKGB,United Kingdom,"To give a bit of a perspective on why the UK is so anti-EU, the fact is that nobody from Brussels or any EU country has ever explained or demonstrated to the public why the EU is a good idea. They'll do it to the government, sure, but never the public.

Education about the EU is extremely limited, and our children are not taught about it in the slightest. The average person doesn't know the difference between the European Commission and the European Council, and they don't see how MEPs make a difference. The case for the EU has not been made, and the EU seems to refuse to do so. Then they turn around and get confused about why they are unpopular. 

From the average UK citizen's point of view, the EU exists as an unelected extraneous body of bureaucrats who inexplicably impose laws on the UK. That's not true, but it is the perception of the majority, and nobody is properly challenging it. The Conservatives are in a bind because of their coalition with the Liberal Democrats, nobody's going to listen to the Liberal Democrats, and Labour seem to be paralysed by the issue. That leaves UKIP, who have the run of public opinion and limited only by their right-wingness and ""old Tory"" sensibilities.

This whole fiasco is a complete shambles. Why is the EU so afraid to sit down with us, talk, and explain?

true,mars20,null,null,"Almost every city around you has great history and/or historic buildings. There is also nice rural areas around you (but consider that europe is much more dense populated than parts of the us, so it's not THAT rural)
Ill list some things for you (I already wrote this on another thread) :

**Regensburg:**
*[View of the City](http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Regensburg_Uferpanorama_2_06_2006.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20060619230718)*

*[The Stone Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Bridge_%28Regensburg%29):* Over 800 years old, served as model for other famous old bridges in Dresden, London&amp; Prague, nothing more to say.
The old town centre with the cathedral is very nice, some nice clubs, good for going out. Also Regensburg is the hme of the [House of Thurn und Taxis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurn_und_Taxis), which is one of the richest houses of Europe and inventors of the modern post system in 16th century.


**Bayreuth:** 
*[The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)
*[The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see

**Bamberg:**
Whoo, where should I begin? 
* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique german medivial town centre. Actualle the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  
*The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope north of the alps.
*Right next to the Cathedral, there is the ""Alte Hofhaltung"" where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers
*The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""
* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above 
* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) (Attemted Hitler assasination, movie with Tom Cruise) had his horse-regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed in 2006.
* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;hl=de&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=18)  as you'll have a superb view over Bamberg and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food. 
*Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;num=30&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=de&amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;t=h&amp;z=17)
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right and enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg
* There is also an quite large US Garrison, so you won't have problems speaking english ;)

I forgot the [Sandkerwa](http://www.sandkerwa.de/bildergalerie/) which is a beerfest / kermesse in the centre of Bamberg during 23.-27. of august. Like Oktoberfest, but smaller, cozy and with one bar/club next to each other and a huge party on the streets in front of the clubs. 

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.
* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.
* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (only i the weeks before christmas)
* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.
*Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe
*[Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp; culture. But i believe this would be a little bit too much ;)

If you have more time &amp; are into nature (well, not canadian nature without population... ;)):  [**""Little swizerland""**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A4nkische_Schweiz) and try some local beer, almost every village has one brewery, there are villages with 1000 people and three breweries (Guiness woorld record: 1500 poeple, 4 breweries)! Also very nice if you want to see some more old [castles](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Burg_Pottenstein.jpg) ;)
If you are into climbing, thats the area to go. Former world's hardest climbing Route, the [Action Directe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Directe_%28climb%29) is located there.
This area has the highest density of *Breweries* world wide with about 80 breweries in an area of about 50 x 50 km², and also there is the highest density of *Bakeries* and *Butchers* world wide, and it's very cheap to live are ;)
If you are into climbing, you probably know the area, or if you want to try it out. There are famous routes like [Action Directe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Directe_%28climb%29) by Wolfang Güllich who was stunt double in Cliffhanger. Nothing beats a day of climbing and a beer and brotzeit after that in one of the small Wirtshäuser in the small villages.
There are many very beatiful [villages](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Judenhof%2BTurmkarst_T%C3%BCchersfeld.jpg) and [caves](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Bingh%C3%B6hle-350.jpg) you can visit too.
If you are interested I can give you some more recommendations on that area too. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/jgfLs.jpg) is a shot i did a few weeks ago. On this hill was one of the oldest settlements in the region, first settlement is dated back to neolithic age, about 4000 B.C., and around 500 B.C. there was a large castle and it was the centre of the region. You can still see some recunstructed walls of that time.

The **[Bavarian Forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Forest)** is also very close to you, in the link you can find some places of interest.

You are also very close to Czech Republic, with **[Prague](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague)**, **[Pilzen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilzen)**, **[Karlsbad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlovy_Vary)** and **[Mariánské Lázně (Marienbad)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marienbad)** as some nice places with european history to visit.

I dont know how much time you want to spend there, BUT DONT MISS BAMBERG! ;)

If you need more information on that area, feel free to ask! :)

I'm going to lay this out for you as a history student from the Netherlands. After Napoleon died NL/BE became one to oppose the French threat. That was about 1805? I'm always fuzzy on exact dates but what I do know is that by 1830 the Belgians had enough, revolted and went and created Belgium.

Edit: don't forget that Amsterdam blocked the Schelde (and with that Antwerp) to have more trade income.
Edit2: we were combined in Philips II of Spain his big empire but in those time ordinary people didnt ever leave their hometown. Not even in their lifetime. So people had no idea of their government or issues of state.

 The culture and language barrier is relatively high. Flemish, or just normal Dutch in Belgium is so different from the Dutch spoken in the Netherlands.

I don't mean to be preachy, but there are four hugely important years to remember in XIXth century European history:

* the [Congress of Vienna in 1815](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna),

* the [revolutions of 1830](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1830),

* the [revolutions of 1848](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848),

* 1870 (unification of Germany and Italy, and French Republic).

(BtW, Napoléon was still alive in 1815, although that doesn't matter much: he died years later, in exile.  In 1805, he was not only very much alive, and very much emperor, he was winning the battle of Austerlitz.)

&gt; but what I do know is that by 1830 the Belgians had enough, revolted and went and created Belgium.

Most importantly, the split between the Netherlands and Belgium in 1830 was along religious lines: between the Catholic South and the Protestant North.",0,1349947503,null,0,false,0,c6ku2tq,t3_11aqc8,t1_c6ku2tq,t1_c6ktt30,null,1430119489,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

I really don't want to sound condescending, but I'm guessing that as relatively small country (Netherlands), the concept of a country harboring slightly different regional cultures seems weird to you, since your country is small enough so that the culture from one end of the country to the other is relatively very similar. But in reality, most countries have regions with significantly different cultures, but those regions found a common ground to make a country.

I simply looked at all 3 sources and questioned the reasoning behind the contractions....

Now I noticed a clear fucking contradiction, so I investigated the fucking sources and your source said that 33% of immigrants actually have citizenship. Therefore there is no contraction when actually calculating the percentage (33%) against the figure of immigrants in your source, it is consistent with the figure of ethnic immigrants that have citizenship in my source ......


 Now my source says that is 94.4% ETHNIC NORWEIGNAN (I dont know where you get the confusion that ethnic norweign isnt ethnic norwegia, the word means what the word means and they made no other definition to suggest otherwise. ) (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/no.html) AS SHOWN IN THIS, what do you not understand?

It depends on context but it is common to refer to mainland Europe as just Europe or 'the continent'.

I would guess that most people in the UK consider us to be less European than other Europeans. It's like we've been invited to the party but we're not really part of the conversation. This is partly because we mistakenly believe that 'the continent' is more similar in culture and politics than it actually is, the same mistake is made by many continentals as well though.

true,olddoc,BELG,Belgium,"We have been different countries for +170 years. Firstly, apart from any cultural or linguistic variations, our laws have evolved in different directions in uncountable ways. The mind boggles to think of how many laws would have to be rewritten in order to harmonize the two regions.     
    
We have a different socialized healthcare system. Our tax code is different. Apart from automatic and obligatory social security tax there's a very complex income tax system with different forms of deductions that is very much intertwined throughout the entire fiscal system. Our pensions systems are different. Our education systems are different on all levels (from lowest grades to university). We have different conceptions of how to organize the public space (""ruimtelijke ordening""... I don't know what that is in english). And that's not even touching on unwritten rules of ""how things are done"" in the respective countries. As in any country, there are the laws, and then there is how you get things done. I think the Flemish would drive the Dutch up the wall when they realize how ""pragmatic"" we treat laws. For example, there's only a tiny fringe group of politicians in Belgium that dares to suggest we change the way we calculate our property tax system (the mysterious [Cadastral income](http://brussels.angloinfo.com/information/money/general-taxes/property-taxes/)), since it hasn't been reflecting the real value of houses since decades. In that Cadastral income parapgraph you can read ""Owners are required to inform the agency of any substantial changes to the building. Owners can be fined or even imprisoned if they do not do so."" I think most Belgians smile and think ""Sure, we will inform you guys if we make changes, NOT."" when they read that.    
    
Politically, does Amsterdam become the capital of Flanders? Or The Hague? Will the Flemish feel comfortable being governed from this new city? On other government levels we also do things differently. We have elected mayors in Belgium, the Dutch mayors are appointed.     
    
Economically, Flanders would move from being economic top-dog in Belgium to being a relatively smaller entity in a larger pond. Antwerp goes from being the most important port in the first country to second-best in the larger new country.

Basically, you chose that word, so don't put quotes on it as if I, or someone else, said it. That's the worst kind of rhetoric technique out there.

And please don't throw me your fake offense. I wasn't suggesting that Wallonia should join France, but was merely making a point about how it's not that big a deal that regions have differences, as long as they have common ground. I merely said that, to the French, a Walloon region wouldn't make much of a difference. Now, if you want my opinion, I admit that I am French of Walloon origin, and would myself welcome a union since I don't see Wallonia as much different to France, than the French region of Picardie is to the French region of Aquitaine. Actually... Wallonia is closer to Picardie in terms of customs and speak than Picardie is to Aquitaine... if you see what I mean. Also, being a region of France doesn't negate regional identity, just so you know... French regions have extremely strong regional identities, to the point that neighboring regions mock eachother constantly, just like neighboring countries do - yet ultimately, when they're abroad, or when they vote in national elections, or when they support a national team, they're French, and it's a beautiful thing. Wallonia has more ties with it's neighboring French regions than with any place else (except Flanders of course, by obligation). You can hate it if you like, it doesn't make it less true. Otherwise, the surveys I've seen on the subject say the Walloon people are pretty divided on the subject, and about half would welcome a union if Belgium explodes (though I'm of those who thinks it's unlikely since your situation has gone on for years and nothing in that direction has been done).

Ce n'est pas de la moquerie, je ne pense pas que cette morale soit changeante (au contraire) et estimer que certains points sont basés sur trop d'idéologies et pas assez de pratique, ce n'est pas se moquer.


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Ta critique portait sur le fait qu'on ne pouvait faire entendre des opinions différentes. 

Ben... comment dire..c'est un peu lié, non ? Il semblerait que tout ce qui n'est pas conforme à cette morale n'est pas contredit ou discuté comme tu le fais, mais discrédité et trop souvent avec l'argument du nombre.


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Je ne suis pas sûr de comprendre ce que tu veux dire par là. Je pense qu'on discuterait mieux sur des exemples.

true,swissmike,SWIT,Switzerland,"In Switzerland we traditionally view the government with a lot of suspicion. In many other countries you have parties that go into opposition - in Switzerland we say that our country's people represents the opposition. This results in a strong federal and democratic tradition where we try to make sure that the state does not garner too much power. Examples of this include the right to a referendum and initiative (the people can *directly* influence laws and the constitution), our federal system where basically anything not mentioned in the constitution is regulated on a state level (examples include education, hospitals, police; but also taxation and so on) , our council of seven instead of a single president etc. 

For example, in order to pay taxes in Switzerland you fill out a tax form where you document your income, wealth etc. There is little to no automatic transfer of information, say from employer to the government, it is all based on self-declaration. If they suspect you might not be honest, they can't just access your bank account or contact your employer without a warrant signed by a judge. The tax authority has the same rights as any private organization.

Unfortunately, due to international pressure many of the traditional safeguards have been weakened such as our bank client privacy (erroneously often referred to as banking secrecy - however it protects clients, not banks!) or the the right to buy a prepaid cell phone without registering your details (this was overturned after Swiss SIM cards were found to be used by al-quaida members.)",0,1349956448,null,0,1349956705,0,c6kuvyt,t3_11at39,t1_c6kuvyt,t1_c6kuav8,null,1430119873,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Now, as I said I'm still not convinced there's so much ties between France and Wallonia beside language. You said yourself that french regions are very different but still are French when it matters and that's the point, walloon are NOT French and except for a minority in favor of a union with France have no desire being one. Most of us don't want to be absorbed in another country (well, maybe the East Cantons want to return to germany but that because they actually are mostly germans already).

Even if we are bathed in french culture (one of the reason we're bad/lazy with foreign languages since we can get our dose of entertainment in french easily) doesn't mean we feel french or close to it. That's not to say we don't like France, french people or anything like that but saying that because we share a border and speak the same language (and obviously have a lot of common cultural ground) we should get together easily is a bit of a stretch. Half of latin america speaks spanish, nobody would say that making a big (well giant) country out of them is a good idea.

Like I said [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/118u09/what_a_sad_day_for_german_musilim_jewish_babies/c6kdgf9), moral values change in every liberal society. However, the strictness lies in adhering to certain values, which are conveniently noted in the Grundgesetz and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 

But I don't seem to understand your position. On the one hand, moral absolutism is a bad thing, on the other hand, the actions of my grandparents make it my absolute obligation to not speak up against jewish people who do things, that are, in my eyes and in regard to human rights, wrong. This means positive discrimination, which may not kill people, but enhances inequality. If someone does an assholish thing, I must be allowed to call him out, no matter if he is a jew, a muslim, a christian, you name it.

You also ascribe many positions to me, which were inferred by you from the virtual ""group"" you seem to be arguing against. I don't belong to that group. I never called Judaism a bronce age cult. Like I don't want to be held responsible for the actions of my grandparents or other people which were arbitrarily born into the same country as I was, I don't hold anyone responsible for the actions of other people who have a similar belief system. Only people can be responsible, only people can be told: You are guilty, redeem yourself.

I no longer believe that we can be in the EU because the EU is changing into something else, it will demand competencies that we simply will not give up. So given that what's the best course? Do we take the Norway approach or do we make a clean break?

Most of the eurosceptic grumbling in the UK in the past has been about fairly petty things with one significant undercurrent, that was ""The EU will one day become a federal entity and we must not become so intertwined with it that it's impossible for us to say NO to joining"".

And from my perspective that was exactly the correct line to take. Not joining the euro was the most important decision we ever took with regards to the EU because we have a genuine choice about whether or not we wish to be in a federal europe. Those countries in the euro don't really have a comparable choice, they can shape what that federal europe becomes but they can't refuse to join it.

So the choice now in my personal opinion is ""leave or join a federal europe"" either one or the other. Our politicians are hoping for some third way compromise, where we're in it a bit but not that much. Personally I don't think that's an option and we're better off making a clean break.

I could go into more details (ID cards are mandatory in many countries, and are not per se a sign of a society that doesn't value privacy; the ""banking secret"" that is so close to the heart of the Swiss people is indeed considered less important to Germans, but perhaps that's for solid reasons like Germans not equating the privacy needs of your bank accounts with the privacy requirements of, say, your personal diary), but there's a much shorter response that illustrates that you were cherrypicking your supporting data -- from your own source (privacyinternational), here's the executive summary of Germany's ""state of privacy"":

&gt;Germany. Assessment: Strong legal and regulatory framework, amongst the best in the world with highly competent regulators and civil society; but the actions of the Government and security services seriously degrade protections.

That's a far cry from responding ""Is this a joke?"" to someone who says Germans value their privacy. In fact, it says pretty much *exactly* that: strong privacy culture exists, that has lately been eroded to a degree by governement actions.

EDIT: just read the document in more detail... man, you're *terrible* at reading comprehension, or you're deliberately trying to be misleading. Example: DNA samples are taken from offenders for serious crimes or *repeated* offenders of minor crimes (you conveniently dropped the word ""repeated""). Both samples and fingerprints of the suspects are then destroyed after 10 (or 5 years for minors) by default, which can be overruled by a judge if there is a reason to retain them longer. 

In summary, I'm not exactly stoked about having a DNA database either, but as far those go, I'd say the German one is one of the more conservative ones, with a substantial amount of privacy considerations built in.

Second, don't the creditor countries have any responsibility for this management of the crisis? They forced a brutal and impossible to implement programme down Greece's throat. The most important deciding factor for the first bailout was to give their banks enough time to get rid of toxic Greek bonds. Not for a minute did they think about the consequences these so-called ""reforms"" would have on Greek society. This talk isn't theoretical, we're talking about taking away the right to collective bargaining and reducing wages by more than 50% in a few short years. 

Third, their money bought them huge political influence in Greece. They can dictate the terms and potentially allow their own interests (geopolitical or private) to dominate the area politically and economically. This isn't theoretical either: Greece is forced to sell strategic assets at ridiculous prices, not to mention that business deals have been struck that will allow German companies to do business in Greece with minimal regulation. 

Finally, the systemic problems of capitalism should not go without mention. This isn't the first crisis nor will it be the last. Excess capital gets invested in desperate places and causes overproduction and/or debt crises. This is not new. Even Germany has gone through this thing.

Well, not really. With overfishing you do not keep the supply stable, you destroy the supply, completely. For example, look at the cod fishing in Kattegatt, there are basically no cods there anymore, and certainly not any of the cods one need. 

Compare that to the cod in the Baltic, who actually is recovering, against all odd, when the Swedish government *finally* decided to do something, at least. So, who got the best most steady supply, the fishermen in Kattegatt or the fishermen in (the Swedish side of ) the Baltic.

There are actually a lot of solutions to the fishing situation. Is it going to save every fish, everywhere? No, of course not, but a lot of fishes in the oceans will be saved. 

What do we need to do - implement them, and actually start to listen to the researchers, the smart politicians, the biologist, the environmentalist etc. Above all - we need to eat fish, and have a steady supply of that, of course, *but* we do not need to eat *all* of the fish, *all* of the time.

If the supply disappears, you can have all the quotas you want, you will not have the supply. 


&gt;But understand that this is not about saving fish at all.

Perhaps not for you, but for me, and a lot of other people. 

&gt;It's about keeping markets stable and profitable — which incidentally also means preventing overfishing, which ultimately leads to extinction

Well, again, you might care just about the market, but I care about stuff like diversity, saving ecosystem etc.
Also, there is absolutely nothing profitable about subsidising fishermen, decade after decade, when maybe just 1/3 o the fleet would do. You do know, that in DK for example, fishermen get paid hundreds of thousands, *not* to go fishing. Where is the market in that? It is nothing stable about subsidising an industry, endlessly.

&gt;Agriculture and fishing are, in this case, exactly the same.

No, they are not, and if you do want to discuss the agricultural policies, could you please start a thread for that. 

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_Atlantic_northwest_cod_fishery) is a classic example from Newfoundland. Against the biologist advise, the fishermen  kept fishing, and eventually, the ecosystem collapsed. The cod is not coming back (how it was before) since the ecosystem has been stressed so much that it has, unfortunately reached a tipping point.

De mon côté, je trouve ça rassurant qu'en l'absence d'éléments matériels, et malgré le battage médiatique, la justice ai résisté à la tentation de condamnations lourdes.

Comme le dit l'article, le gros problème, ce n'est pas vraiment le jugement, c'est plutôt la difficulté d'instruire des accusations de viols, longtemps après les faits. On a déjà eu de nombreux cas où l'instruction s'est enflammée (Outreau) et où des gens ont été condamnés à tort lorsque le jugement ne reposait que sur les accusations et sur des rapports psychologiques.

En justice, il vaut toujours mieux un coupable en liberté qu'un innocent en prison. C'est aussi pour ça qu'on a supprimé la peine de mort.

My only data come from this article. The fishermen need artificial buyout to keep the prices up. Otherwise, it's unprofitable for them. 
Therefore, if the buyout didn't happen, the fishermen would not make profit and some of them would drop out of business. This is unfortunate for them BUT: 1) keeps natural resource of fish intact, 2) keeps a lot of money in EU's pocket. Right now we are only financing waste.

But... what are you implying?
That if we strip fishermen of their aid and stop funding unnecessary fishing we will some day wake up in a world, where fish are expensive, because the demand went up and the supply can't deliver? Is that what you're saying?

Because if it is I think it's preferable to wasting 17 million kgs of fish which also depletes natural resources.
Stability of the fish market **is not** critical and should only be regulated in a manner that takes care of enviroment, not the workers.
