true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"This is actually a general reply to your conversation with specofdust...

Why Finland isn't in NATO...

**NATO...**

* What is NATO? Is it an organization whose mission is the defence of its members, or is it an organization in search of mission?
* NATO is more or less lead and united by the US, if the US goes into a war that is strictly not defensive, do we have to give our support for them to make sure their support for us in the future, namely *""if you are not with us, you are against us""*.

**Russia...**

* Russia is far more worried about China and its strategic situation in Siberia than it is about the west. There is zero chance of the west dreaming about having more lebensraum. The reason why Russian leaderships acts aggressively against the west is because they have nothing to fear about doing so. 
* Many rich Russians have bought property from Finland, they like to keep Finland being Finland, otherwise there is no use for this place for them. There is also loads of economic integration happening, much to do with opening of the fast train connection and soon to be finished motorway between Helsinki and St. Petersburg.
* Russia is not Soviet Union.

**EU...**

* Finland hasn't been neutral since its admission to the EU. This has been the opinion of the political leadership since the admission, and as years have gone by, this view has strengthened and been lately starting to gain acceptance from the Russians too - Russians woke up around the Georgian war / Lisbon Treaty that there is this European Union entity.
* EU since the Lisbon Treaty has internal security clauses. For example Sweden has already noted that this and said that during a crisis it would help any EU country in trouble.
* EU will build its own military organization in the next decade or two. It is only a matter of time and need. Already there are infrastructure projects like Galileo that will be used by all European armed forces for their navigational needs, yes, it is meant officially for civilian use, but can and will be used by military.


I myself in the 90s would have liked Finland to join NATO, but nowadays I would prefer not to join it, but rather have an EU defence organization. Actually this EU organization could be the European part of the NATO, I would have nothing against it, but it would need to be an equal partner in the NATO with the USA.",0,1326821935,null,0,false,0,c3i3t8a,t3_ojxjq,t1_c3i3t8a,t1_c3hvljw,null,1428195929,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

true,Eeko,FINL,Finland,"I think the disappointment is a bit stemming from cold war propaganda (""they all left you alone"") than genuine lack of Swedish involvement. There is a number of issues which are considered ""understandable"", but still form something of a wound in common psyche. For example, it is genuinely considered good, humane and somewhat beyond call of duty that Sweden took thousands of war-orphans into their care while Finland was fighting. But then after years of fighting, a number of children refused to return to their parents (well, going back to a burned country to work in farms and rebuilding a nation ain't something many would choose voluntarily.) Then the public refusal of aid is widely considered to have been an instrument to pressure Finland to settle for the harsh terms of surrender.

I think the post-war development is what raises more anger today. During the Cold War, Sweden was under the NATO umbrella (though unofficially) and Finland happened to be troublesomly positioned at the shortest flight-route between NATO and soviet bases and population centres. When both of your neighbors plan is to nuke (or let a superpower to nuke) the shit out from you if threatened (Sweden even planned to build its own nukes in the 50's and 60's), you kind of take offense. 

Even though all the stuff of WW2 and the lessons learned (can't really trust to receive help if asked), the general wish (or the illusion sold to the people) of the time was that Sweden would figure out that the Red Army would march over them next and would (be morally obliged to) ally with Finland in conflict. So with that and this weird idea of honorary debt of ""because of what we did in the 40's, you don't have 600km of Soviet border (which would push Sweden to the geopolitical shitstorm where Finland was for the entire Cold War), or worse"", moves of Sweden and its armed forces were and are still viewed with very special interest. For example, if Sweden would have gone officially NATO, there would have probably been very little to stop Finland from ending up in Warsaw pact. Even all the years after CW, stuff like Sweden abolishing conscription is still seen as backstabbing and ""unfair"".

Ionoi is Catalan, and even though I consider myself fairly neutral in the subject (not being Catalan or Spanish), there are things that I would say that he does not wish to hear/accept, and having many Catalan friends I completely understand where he is coming from and why he defends his points of view (even though I didn't even heard them). Is that pretentious? Yes it is, but believe me, I've had this discussion many many times over the years with many different people and one thing I know is that this is the kind of issue that will not make you any catalan friends and will cause you to lose some if they are not good sports. That is how heated the catalan independence/debate can get!

Well, I don't know Ionoi, and I don't have anything against him but he would certainly have something against me when we ended our debate, and since I have no interest in wasting my time having a conversation I already had several times, with someone I don't know, and that will not like me when the conversation ends, I just decided to use that time doing something useful for society instead.

I don't have any problem explaining my views on catalonia to you or anyone else, I won't just embark in such discussion with any catalan that is not a close friend of mine for the already mentioned reasons. 

With that being said, I'm at your disposition to explain my views on catalonia and answer questions if you like, até em Português se for caso disso!

""It looks to me this guy Ross from Shanghai is fiddling about with the exchange rate numbers to produce drivel.

He talks about stability between the pound and the euro in 2011 and then says ""the fall in UK GDP in 2007 - 2010 was $562 billion,"" without saying the pound depreciated some 25% against the dollar between 2007 - 2010, mainly in late 2008.

http://www.google.co.uk/finance?q=GBPUSD

Such a correction should come as no surprise at all because the pound was heavily overvalued against the dollar at some $2 the £1.

$1.5 the £1, where we are now is a far more sustainable relationship.

http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/currency

The UK produces more that $2 trillion per annum.

Over a four year period, 2007 - 2010, that's $ 8 trillion.

I make c. $560 billion is c . 7% of $2 trillion, over 4 years (560/8000) - less than 2% per annum, even on Ross' numbers that don't come readily to hand from a glance at the World Bank's web site.

Make no mistake, the UK is hurting like everyone else but the suggestion that it has surreptitiously fallen off a cliff, waving bye bye to Italy as it does so, is probably wrong.""

How is meat usually prepared in France? How often do you eat cream sauces verses, say, simply broiling meat with herbes? Is steaming vegetables a common method of preparation?

And it seems like you eat quite well. It's a shame it's nearly impossible to savor eating in New York.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;You're not discussing the ""objective"" facts of history here - you're distorting Finnish motivations and beliefs during and after the war and categorizing them based on your own values and norms as opposed to Finnish ones.

I've been honest about my position. I'm a British person who has spent significant time in Finland and even more so time around Finns. I've made no pretensions as to having an authoritative position about Finnish history, and rather have just said my opinion based on the (not insignificant) reading I've done coupled with the many Finnish opinions I've heard.

&gt; In other words what people typically do after reading some books and talking to some people about a topic and then thinking they're experts in it when in reality they're not.

Again, I never said I was an expert, I've just presented what I believe to be a broadly accurate position based upon the experiences and readings I've done.

&gt;It might make sense to YOU for Finns to distrust the West when in reality according to most Finns the threat has always been to the east.

No fucking shit. The number one thing that Finns I've talked to have been concerned about is Russia. Sure, I talk to the Finns I know (and am, by proxy, related to) - but nonetheless their primary worry in politics is the two headed eagle. That said, Finns I've talked to have also discussed a fair amount of historical distrust toward the ""west"" as most consider it, and even to the western world as it exists in it's more bipolar form today. For instance I've head many Finns being very angry at the US after Finland bought a whole load of cluster bombs of the US, and then, at least in their opinion, felt that the US forced the cluster bomb treaty upon them to make the bombs they'd just bought illegal. Now personally I find this unlikely since the US hasn't signed up to any treaty prohibiting use of cluster bombs, but the Finns I've talked to are of the opinion that this is the case, so I consider it worthwhile mentioning simply because that's *their* opinion, and it's important to recognise not just facts, but also the opinions that people hold within a country.",0,1326936384,null,0,false,0,c3idtiw,t3_ojxjq,t1_c3idtiw,t1_c3idedx,null,1428200717,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Was money involved in the transfer of the salvia samples, e.g. did the donors get paid for their samples? (Else it wouldn't be ""trafficking"")
* The DKMS is a non-profit, a so-called ""gemeinnützige GmbH"". They cannot, by law, turn up profits to be distributed to shareholders.
* What are the ""usual"" fees? Usual in which context? Usual in Spain? In the Iberian Peninsula? In Europe? Everything is a little more expensive over here: cars, taxes, why not bone marrow matching services?
* As far as I understand it, DKMS does not invoice recipients, but their insurances.

And Putin &amp; Medvedev visit FI quite often as well. From their POV, all their other borders to Europe are filled with nations who pretty much hate Russians whereas Finns are barely cautious. Important trade like the Nord Stream gas-pipe (recent history tells us why Russia might be a bit cautious of their gas flowing through the ex-Soviet states like Ukraine...) brings East closer to us. And the bilateral trade, industrialisation to pay the war reparations are for us what made it possible to build a welfare state over the 3rd world shithole we were in after 4 bloody wars...

true,Avohaj,null,null,"It really depends on how and how early you learn english (this is also the **TL;DR**). I'm not sure how it currently is but when we started learning english in school I was around 14 or so which is to late if you ask me. A secondary language should be taught alongside german as soon as the kids can write (because the younger they are the better they are at learning)

I DIY-taught myself much english, mostly vocabulary but indirectly grammer too I guess. I used to play the shit out of the Heroes of Might and Magic 2 demo which was only available in english. Basically everything had images with it and I was always good at association so I only had to look up a few words (like I had such a hard time understanding the phrase 'up to 3 spaces away' on a spell back then, the dictionary wasn't really a help on the word spaces but I figured it out eventually). I also learnt proper forming of sentences right away that way.

So my only problem was pronunciation (I'm sure I write that wrong 99% of the time) because I was only reading for myself in front of the computer and nobody could really show me how to do it properly until we got to it in school and because of the source my base vocabulary came from with some simply everyday words (I think I was in 8th or 9th grade when I learned the word 'traffic lights') but I was able to learn them rather quickly because english always felt really natural to me. I think it's because I got into the language earlier than most of my age - but probably also because I 'forced' myself to learn it because I wanted to understand the game I  played and enjoyed. 

So like your example I myself don't really think much about the cases when I write or read english. I just do what feels right. I mean I probably get it wrong often still but at the end I left school with my english grade (A) being better than my german grade (B) (to be fair, the stuff you had to do for a good english grade were much easier than what you had to do for a good german grade - at least for me because they didn't assume you had prior experience with english)

Aside from that I see many people having problems with forming sentences the right way because that's done differently in english than in german. Again, something that could be avoided by giving a more natural approach to the language than just learning vocabulary and grammer at the start - which is the main problem, not only limited to germans learning english but probably it's much more viable for that scenario (and the other way around) because the languages are actually so close to each other.",0,1326969207,null,0,true,0,c3ii8bj,t3_ompas,t1_c3ii8bj,t3_ompas,null,1428202856,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

No MD messes around legal stuff, too much at risk even to slightly consider it.

In Spain, in order to be declared braindead, it is necessary an evaluation from 3 different doctors, one of which must be a Neurologist and the 3 doctors cannot be on the same team.  This practice varies from country to country, so does the definition of brain-death!!! Yes the brain-death definition is not medical, is legal and defined by your elected Parliament!

About organ donors in Spain. It works like this, everyone is by default a donor, you can explicitly express that you do not want to be a donor as well as what is to be course of action regarding what it is to be done in case of serious disease (some people just don't want to reanimated if they are going to be a vegetable for 4 months, and believe me, there are fates worse than death).

In case that there is no written document about what it is to be done in these particular cases, the family isn't asked if they want or not to donate your organs, they are asked if you ever manifested yourself against it, if you did then there is no transplant.  Mentioning on a conversation with friends that you do not want to donor will make you a non donor. In any case, all of these procedures are made AFTER the patient is considered lost (the neurological death precedes the consideration for transplants).

true,DocTomoe,GERM,Germany,"&gt; The bone marrow surely belongs to the person whose bones it is.

And you read otherwise where? The system does not claim rights on bone marrow, but on the dataset based on it. The organisation who took and analyzed the sample has put money in this process, and gets compensated. The mere fact that not every sample collected (the fewest do) leads to a transplantation does mean that the ""positive match"" has to pay for all the ""negative tests"". 

To maximize the intake of samples and to prevent double testings, an international database exists, which DKMS has put it's datasets in, with the agreement that whoever gets this donor has to pay the analysis and administrative fees.

&gt; with the donors permission? Doesn't the company need permission to store samples for any length of time? Seems like a privacy issue

It seems you are not a registered donor (I happen to be). You undersign that they are allowed to do exactly this. Which makes sense (Your marrow might be incompatible with the case at hand, but a perfect match for someone else fourty kilometers away.)

&gt; Not using the database that DKMS has set up seems like the thing to do.

Sure, let your patients die while they wait for another donor from another, smaller database. I guess they would love that idea.

I never said anti-western, I simply said that they had a level of distrust of the western NATO type countries during the cold war, feeling that they were probably on their own if things went hot between the two superpowers.

1. They get a patient that has no viable match in their database. 
2. Now they go there with a team of paramedics, and collect samples from volunteers. This usually happens on a saturday in a large auditorium, and is heavily advertised both by the patients family as well as by DKMS itself.
3. These samples get tested. Statistically, there is a higher chance of viable donors in your town, especially if your family has lived there for a longer time. 
4. If a match of the individual donor for the original patient was done, great, let's start the transplantation process.
5. If no match of the invidual donor was made, DKMS puts the info into it's database, to make it possible to match the donor with a future or present patient. This info has a half-life, because, well, donors don't live forever. Matching the nonviable donors to completely foreign patients minimizes costs and maximizes survival in leukaemia patients.

The 14500 bucks/transplantation donor are for financing this process. The article, and the ONT press release, are highly biased, imho. 

The spanish system might work to ~~extract~~ get donated viable organs from just-deceased persons, but bone marrow transplants need active intervention by willing donors, while they are alive and healthy. It seems to me their ONT system fails in such cases.

 As a means of employment manufacturing is entering a relative dead end. By value UK exports of manufactured goods has grown over the last 30 years despite what the press often trumpet. What is often pointed out is that relative to growth in other sectors manufacturing is tiny, for this reason tax and regulation that inhibits manufacturing is probably not a wise idea, especially given the weakness of the economies in the EU at present.

It will not taken China long to adapt Western methods and then we will see further erosion of EU and US manufacturing, without replacing this with higher value and higher tech then we're in for a shitty ride.

School was the greatest obstacle I had to overcome to learn English. I had English lessons from fifth grade on, and countless vocabulary and grammar lessons effectively destroyed any shred of interest I had in the language.

It took me a few years to become reasonably fluent by simply using the language in everyday life.

To put it simply, just like I'm alive despite school, I now speak English moderately fluently despite school's greatest efforts.

&gt; the fact that the ONT does believe DKMS's actions to be illegal does not make them illegal. There are a lot of conjunctives in that paragraph. Questions of legality should be solved in a court of law.

I already answered to that one. It *will* be decided in court.

&gt; Isn't there some kind of EU legislation about tissue traffic? (I only found this, but it doesn't define tissue. Is a salvia sample, and thus parts of the oral mucosa, which should be unfit to transplant, ""tissue"" in the sense of the 2002 Additional Protocol to the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine concerning Transplantation of Organs and Tissues of Human Origin? Was money involved in the transfer of the salvia samples, e.g. did the donors get paid for their samples? (Else it wouldn't be ""trafficking"")

DKMS takes blood or saliva samples. And yeah it is tissue. And it's trafficking because they are doing it without the permits.  

&gt; The DKMS is a non-profit, a so-called ""gemeinnützige GmbH"". They cannot, by law, turn up profits to be distributed to shareholders.

The fact that they are ""non-profit"" doesn't mean they cannot get money to fulfill other objectives. In the article: After the donors are called up to donate their marrow for free, DKMS charges recipients 14,500 euros to cover costs. 

&gt; What are the ""usual"" fees? Usual in which context? Usual in Spain? In the Iberian Peninsula? In Europe? Everything is a little more expensive over here: cars, taxes, why not bone marrow matching services?

Usual in Spain. These are ""donors"" that the DKMS has potentially ""stolen"" from our registry. It's a bit stupid for them to be registered in Germany, isn't it? And about the ~~demagogic~~ price part: taxes are not so far away, thanks to some ""austerity measures"". The funny thing is, salaries are light years away.

&gt; As far as I understand it, DKMS does not invoice recipients, but their insurances. 

As far as I'm concerned, it's all the same.

&gt; DKMS is funded by the Krebshilfe and by donations. Coty is one of those donors, but by far not the the largest one.

Good ... then I trust the judges at the EuGH, because knowing our healthcare system, the DKMS guys will fight it to the bitter end.

&gt; DKMS takes blood or saliva samples. And yeah it is tissue. And it's trafficking because they are doing it without the permits.

Trafficking implies the exchange of money for the samples. I see no indication of money having changed hands for samples between donors and/or representatives in Spain on the one side, and representatives in Germany on the other side.

&gt; The fact that they are ""non-profit"" doesn't mean they cannot get money to fulfill other objectives. 

Well, actually, that's exactly what the gGmbH suffix means. They have one purpose: operating a bone marrow donor database, and they cannot take or  use money for any other reason. In exchange, they are tax-exempt. 

In this case, they took ~1200 samples, with a testing cost of ~60 € per test (a figure I got from wikipedia, could be completely wrong, that's 72000 bucks for that mass testing event. They have to find donors for five patients to break even. I don't see where they could actually make profits in there.

&gt; These are ""donors"" that the DKMS has potentially ""stolen"" from our registry.

From what I've read in the article, the ONT registry failed a patient, effectually telling him to wait for death or a wonder, while DKMS staged one of their mass-testing events. A ressource, in this case bone marrow donors, that is untapped, has been used to better the lives of several, not only this one patient. I do believe ONT has acted criminally negligent, and should be very, very quite and go into a corner to shame itself a little.

&gt; It's a bit stupid for them to be registered in Germany, isn't it? 

As the database is available internationally (and there is a collective international database), not really. It just comes down to who paid the initial testing, and who gets reimbursed for that testing.

&gt; taxes are not so far away, thanks to some ""austerity measures"". The funny thing is, salaries are light years away.

This is a completely different matter, and should not be a factor in life-or-death situations.

For example, take the following words: ""wo"", ""ta"", ""chi"", ""he"", ""le"", ""hui"", and ""men"". Respectively, they mean ""I"", ""he"", ""eat"","" drink"", ""(past tense particle)"", ""shall"", and ""(plural)"".

* wo chi le = I have eaten.
* wo he le = I have drunk.
* wo hui he = I will drink.
* ta hui he = He will drink.
* ta men hui he = They will drink.
* wo men hui he = We will drink.

No worrying about genders or conjugation. Being able to hear and make the tones is the hardest part, but once you're over that hump (and I know plenty of people who have done it) it's not bad at all. Contrast that with a language like Bulgarian where verbs can have separate aspects, e.g. ""дойда"" for ""come"" and ""идвам"" for ""coming"" - with each of those having different forms for tenses and person.

On a separate note, I'm surprised to see Korean ranked as ""Hard"", especially with Turkish ranked as ""Medium"". I've learned both and the justification for ranking Korean there doesn't make sense. Both Korean and Turkish are agglutinative and, if I recall correctly, are even under the same language family. Both involve verb conjugations, and both are structured as Subject-Object-Verb as opposed to English's Subject-Verb-Object.

true,Deusdies,EART,Earth,"Grammar is easier than Serbian, Russian, German, and French (the last based on peer experience). They seldom use cases - the existence of nominative, genitive, and accusative alone makes it simpler as opposed to 7 cases (Serbian), 9 (Arabic), 6 (Russian). And these cases are really easy to construct.

The nonexistence of gender. At first I was baffled with this fact, but when you think about it, it all makes sense. Why the hell would anyone care what gender is the word ""book""? English has no genders and obviously it works just fine. 

Plural construction is easier - simply adding s or es at the end of the word, and you have a plural construction. Serbian, Russian, and German have quite a few words where irregularities appear (Serbian - changing the whole ending of a word, German adding umlauts). 

Verb tense construction is a lot easier - past simple tense is constructed simply by adding d or ed at the end of the word (save for a specific list of irregular verbs which also follow a clear pattern). Not so in German or Serbian, where in order to construct a past tense, you sometimes must not only completely edit the word, but edit the other connecting part of the sentence as well. Present perfect, past perfect are also constructed using simple and clearly defined rules. 

Independence of words with regards to the rest of the sentence. In that sentence, I could have edited the word ""words"" into ""word"" and I wouldn't have to edit the rest of the sentence. If I did the same in Serbian, Russian or Bulgarian, I would have to change ""Independence"", ""regards"" and ""sentence"" as well. 

A ""no two negations"" rule. While it may seem illogical to someone coming from another language, it makes perfect sense and does a lot when it comes to not confusing the audience. 

The existence of phrasal verbs - push and chin are two different words that have nothing to do with physical activities, but ""push ups"" (so, pushing up) and ""chin ups"" (getting your chin up) do - both of these phrasal verbs' equivalents are two different words in Serbian (Bulgarian, Polish) that have nothing to do with ""push"" and ""chin"" equivalents.

A clear, precise, and short syntax. ""We are loading the people on the boat"". ""Wir laden diese Leute an der Schiff ein"" both have the same meaning. However, remove the ""ein"" in German version and the sentence falls apart - what the hell are you doing to the passengers? (Okay probably not the best example but you get the idea)

The verb construction in any tense. I move, you move, we move... they're all the same across pronouns (except for 3rd singular when you simply add ""s""). You moved, I had moved, we have moved (all simple tenses). In Serbian (Russian, and German to some extent), you'd have to change it based on the pronoun and the tense as well.

The few annoying things about English IMHO is the existence of the article (though that too is a lot simpler than being as that there are ""a, an, the"" as opposed to German ""der, die, das, die*"" which have a declension). Serbian has no articles and it works fine. Another thing is the relative lack of rules when it comes to spelling. The name pronounced as ""kacy"" can be spelled ""kacy, casey, casy, kacey"". Serbian (and Bulgarian, German, and Russian to a lesser extent) follows the always-one-letter-one-sound rule. The letter ""a"" is always an ""a"" and cannot be ""ei"", ""um"", etc.  ",0,1327000995,null,0,false,0,c3im5kc,t3_ondp3,t1_c3im5kc,t1_c3ilt1u,null,1428204780,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16

Realistisch gesehen ist die einzige Möglichkeit die GEMA abzuschaffen bzw. zu entmachten eine Alternative aufzustellen die für Kunstschaffende lukrativer, komfortabler und attraktiver ist als die GEMA Knechtung.

Die GEMA ist eng verwurzelt in der deutschen Politik weswegen sie sich diese Strategien rausnehmen können wie die Beweislast auf den Vorführer von Musik und nicht dem Rechteinhaber aufzuerlegen. Da verhält es sich ungefähr so wie mit der GEZ.

Was du machen kannst ist keine GEMA Musik mehr zu konsumieren, neue Lizenzformen wie Creative Commons etc zu unterstützen. Eine einfache ""Wir schießen den Laden jetzt auf den Mond""-Lösung ist im besten Fall unrealistisch und schlicht ohne Macht und unfassbare Geldmengen nicht umsetzbar. Solange Sesselfurzer die ihre Musik noch auf Plastikscheiben kaufen die Entscheidungsgewalt über diese Systeme haben kommen wir kein Stück weiter. Das einzige was man machen kann ist neue Technologien und Ansätze soweit zu unterstützen dass sie die alten Modelle irgendwann verdrängen (siehe MP3/DRM Problematik). Da nach dem bestehenden Urheberrecht die Verfasser oder besser ihre Verwertungsgesellschaften exklusiv entscheiden können wie sie ihre Inhalte nutzen bleibt uns als Usern nicht viel übrig außer Alternativen zu bevorzugen. Man kann nicht Mittels Zwang erreichen dass jemand seine Inhalte weniger stark ""beschützt"". Wenn man mal das Beispiel Audiodownloads mit DRM ansieht haben wir als Nutzer einfach so lange weiter Musik getauscht und DRM Angebote gemieden bis die Hersteller einsehen mussten dass sie nur noch Geschäfte machen können wenn Sie sich auf weniger restriktives einlassen.

After watching the video, and as i understood it, it seems to me that the main point of Mr Cohn-Bendit was the ""requirement for balanced information in the media"", and the supposed requirement for that in the Hungarian media law. If that is so, then his speech was based on an error, misinformation (or deliberate lie). There is (and was) no requirement for media organizations to maintain ""balanced reporting"", and it was never prescribed by the media law. That is a commonly repeated false accusation, along with the huge fines for not maintaining that ""balanced information"". There is not such thing.

A lot of speeches and accusations are built much the same way:

* Make a false assumption, accusation in one short sentence without showing or quoting any proof
* Tell a lengthy speech about the consequences of that assumption. The observations would be indeed valid, if the prime accusation would be valid.
* The listener concentrates on the truth of the valid consequences, forgetting to question the validity of the prime accusation.

I'm sure there is a name to this logical fallacy (or rhetorical tactic, or journalist strategy).

So Germany loaned out a lot of money for other states to import German goods, but whether that money will ever be seen again is another question entirely. 

Also, I think that German exports to eurozone countries are closer to 40%. Maybe your 70% means the whole of the EU? (which probably also isn't true, but I'm not as sure on that).

As for strong currency: Note that Germany already was a leading export nation prior to the introduction of the euro. Germany does not primarily compete on price (as e.g. China does in a lot of ways) but quality. Note also that many exports require preceding imports, which in turn are eased by a strong currency.

&gt; They seldom use cases

But an average Serbian also uses like 3-4 cases most of the time, the rest is for literaly works. Also, English has a lot of grammatical stuff that you can only read about in ""higher literature"" and not on TV, so maybe you don't know that these things exist. For example Ulysses from James Joyce, according to Wikipedia it uses 30.030 different words.

&gt; The nonexistence of gender

But then you have to memorize that words like ship and country are feminine.

&gt; Plural construction is easier - simply adding s or es at the end of the word,

forum - fora, child - children, scissors - scissors

forums, childs and scissor is not correct

&gt; Independence of words with regards to the rest of the sentence.

True, but in English the word order is much more important, and just by moving around the words in the sentence you can change its meaning. So it's more difficult to understand the meaning of the sentence if you don't understand the role of each word in it. In Serbian, I can just look at the suffix/padež and see what the role of the word is (*who* is doing *what* to *whom*)

&gt; A clear, precise, and short syntax. ""We are loading the people on the boat"". 

The Serbian version is shorter and more precise: ""Ukrcavamo ljude na brod"".

&gt; You moved, I had moved, we have moved

But then consider that you use the word ""have"", which means possession. So you said that ""I am possessing movement"" which makes no sense to someone just learning English. And you see that have/has *does* change based on the person and time, similar to Serbian grammar.

&gt; The few annoying things about English IMHO is the existence of the article

Hungarian has articles and it makes things a lot easier. I think in this regard Serbian is more difficult because you can have double-meanings without an article.

""I drank the coffee"". ""I drank a coffee"".

""Popio sam kafu"". ""Popio sam kafu"".

Did you drink *the* specific coffee, or just any other coffee?

&gt; Serbian follows the always-one-letter-one-sound rule.

But Serbian is also a partially tonal language and the tone of a letter can change the meaning of the word. Here's an example you learn in school: ""gore gore gore gore nošto gore gore dole""

&gt;Germans have the strange habit of translating them.  

While this is true, in most cases you could also use the latin word instead. The word ""transparent"", for example, is frequently used in German. So are many other Latin words. [Wikipedia has the full list.](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_lateinischer_Lehn-_und_Fremdw%C3%B6rter_im_Deutschen)  
In most cases these words also have a literal translation in German but more often than not the non-translated Latin will be understood.  

Also, the French do the same with new words that don't have a French translation yet. They even have a government agency for that:  

&gt; The Academy was founded in 1635. At that time, we heard on the programme, there were many different dialects spoken in France, and the aim of the Academy was to promote one single official French language for everyone to speak. The original aims were liberté, égalité and fraternité - all would speak the same language and thus be equal.

 

&gt;Much of the Academy's efforts go into resisting the invasion of French by English words, such as the very popular le buzz. Sometimes, it is successful - as in the case of l'ordinateur, computer, for instance, but often it arrives on the scene too late - the English words, blog and podcast, for instance, are already in such widespread usage that no-one wants to use the Academy's original suggestions - bloc-notes and baladodiffusion.

Der 'copyright lawyer' von oben war natürlich der ebenso berüchtigte Gravenreuth: 

&gt;Die Amiga-Spiele waren letztlich auch der Schlüssel für Kim Schmitz, um sich Zugang zu rund einhundert illegalen Mailboxen in ganz Deutschland zu verschaffen. Es sprach sich schnell herum, dass er in der Szene angekommen war und die neuen illegalen Veröffentlichungen zeitnah hochladen konnte. Für viele Betreiber Grund genug, ihr Misstrauen über Bord zu werfen und ihn in ihr System zu lassen. Schmitz lud hoch &amp; 'runter und machte Mitschnitte aller Dateien, die dort verfügbar waren. Mit den Captures ging er zu Gravenreuth, der Schmitz wiederum pro Bust bezahlt haben soll. Für Kimble hatte dies mehrere Vorteile. Er selbst stand unter dem persönlichen Schutz des Münchener Rechtsanwalts und konnte sich seiner unliebsamen Mitstreiter nach Gusto entledigen. Später ging die Zusammenarbeit so weit, dass man gemeinsam eine Telefonhotline für die Szene erstellt haben soll. Szenetalk nannte sich diese und bot den Anrufern mehrere Räume, wo die Szenemitglieder aus aller Welt miteinander sprechen konnten. Angerufen wurde lediglich auf Kosten der wahren Eigentümer der CCs. Schmitz kassierte also doppelt ab: Als Betreiber der Hotline und als Großhändler der illegalen Telefonkarten. Wie Evrim Sen in seinem Buch Hackertales erzählt, hat Gravenreuth seinen Lieferanten irgendwann einfach nicht mehr bezahlt. Kimble hörte auf GvG mit Informationen zu versorgen, Szenetalk schloss seine Pforten und Schmitz wandte sich anderen Projekten zu.

An American on reddit who knows (some) Bulgarian… as a member of a 7.5 million people community, I'm always very intrigued to see people interested in this little piece of land/culture.

Bulgarian, as you said, btw, is *fiendish* to learn for English natives, I'd put it around the same difficulty as Polish.

Even though Polish has 6 cases and rather complicated nominal morphology, it has only 5 tenses + Conjunctive, which makes for a pleasantly straight forward verbal system (I'm learning Polish right now, and I'm always very pleased by how nice and relatively regular it is in this regard.)

The Bulgarian verbal morphology on the other hand is truly strange. Quoting from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_verbs)

&gt; [Bulgarian verbs] are inflected for person, number and sometimes gender. They also have lexical aspect (perfective and imperfective), voice, nine tenses, three moods, four evidentials and six non-finite verbal forms.

&gt; But an average Serbian also uses like 3-4 cases most of the time, the rest is for literaly works. 

This is bullcrap. Average Serbs use all the cases all the time - language without all of them would simply be unimaginable/be laughed at. People in villages and in the south might sometimes have issues with cases, but the general population uses all of them. Nominative all the time, genitive ""idem iz prodavnice"", ""iz Kragujevca sam"", dativ ""dao sam Vladi ovo"", akuzativ ""video sam Vladu"", vokativ ""Vlado!"", instrumental ""bio sam sinoc sa Vladom"", lokativ ""stavio sam kafu na sto"". These are all very common phrases in Serbian. Honestly I don't think anyone could pass IV grade elementary if they didn't properly use all the cases.

&gt; But then you have to memorize that words like ship and country are feminine.

Yes, but you don't have to memorize a trillion other words and their genders. When I was learning German, memorizing genders was a hassle because they're completely different from Serbian noun genders. 

&gt; forum - fora, child - children, scissors - scissors
forums, childs and scissor is not correct

Nitpicking. Of course there are exceptions and irregularities, but I was speaking in general. 

&gt; The Serbian version is shorter and more precise: ""Ukrcavamo ljude na brod"".

Yes, because the predicate ""ukrcavamo"" (loading btw) tells you who is loading them, when is loading them, and what is it doing (loading). In this regards I'd argue that English is simpler, because even though it is shorter, a foreigner would have to learn this form of the verb ""ukrcavati"".

&gt; And you see that have/has does change based on the person and time, similar to Serbian grammar.

The meaning changes, perhaps I have picked a not so good example, but the verb construction doesn't. Again nitpicking.

&gt; ""I drank the coffee"". ""I drank a coffee"".
""Popio sam kafu"". ""Popio sam kafu"".
Did you drink the specific coffee, or just any other coffee?

What specific coffee? There's no such thing as a specific coffee. Did you drink NesCafe? In that case, you'll say ""Popio sam nes kafu"". Did you drink that coffee sitting on the table? Then you'll say ""Popio sam onu/ovu kafu"".

In dem Bereich hat sich rechtlich einiges geändert und es wird oft von mod. Unterlassungserklärungen abgeraten. Ich würde mal unverbindlich einen Anwalt anschreiben es gibt da diverse Spezialisten. Im Endeffekt ist die Rechtslage so dass man dir nachweisen müsste dass du die Songs runtergeladen hast.

Grundsätzlich musst du erstmal nichts zahlen bis der Abmahnanwalt ein tatsächliches Gerichtsverfahren anstrebt und du Post vom Gericht bekommst. Dann ist es halt meistens schon zu spät und du brauchst auf jeden Fall einen Anwalt.

Lies dich in die Gesetze ein. Lern soviel du kannst über deine Rechte und Pflichten. Du sagst du gehst zur Schule, wer ist der Halter des Anschlusses? Bist das du oder deine Mutter?

* He raises excellent points, but as per my previous post, those excellent points often do not relate to Hungary at all. They fail on the basic accusations not being true.

* Cohn-Bendits stance on minorities might be just like the previous Hungarian Socialist-Liberal governments. All talk and nothing done.

They believed that in regards to minorities, the ""perception"" is the important part. But from all the money spent on integrating Gypsies 90% was lost in corruption. Contrary to that approach, the current government believes that actions will improve the ""perception"" too in time. If Gypsies get a job, the racist assumption that ""Gypsies are too lazy to work"", will go away. If parents of Gypsy children are required to send their children to schools, then all children will finish at least elementary school, and the ""much of Gypsies are illiterate"" will go away too. You can not like the actions, but all the talk alone will not help.

* If you look at the media landscape in Hungary, you will see that free speech is alive and well. The relevant point to make about this, is that free speech is a cultural thing. Westerners might think of Hungary as about some post-dictatorial weak democracy with weak intelligentsia. But that is not true, journalism and free speech do have a tradition. Hungarians have learned during the communist years to value free speech. 

* But free speech is not always the truth. My grudge against the Socialists and Free Liberals (and the journalists serving that political side) is that they find it justified to spread lies for political benefit. The point related to your comment is that the opinion poll which you refer to (and which suggests that most Hungarians are not caring, but more relevantly, that Fidesz has lost it voter base), was done by the opinion-poll making company Ipsos, and it is known that Ipsos always publishes polls which are biased towards the Socialists. Yesterday another opinion-poll was published (by another company), which has the result, that Fidesz would still win by landslide (with 52% support among certain voters and 32% among all population), and has only lost voters minimally. I would not make any final conclusions yet based on that poll alone either, but wait for the remaining two polling companies to publish their results too.

I think it's a dumb thing to do, but that's what some people say.

The worst is that their program is as bad on other issues, not only economics. They want to put a tax on products from countries they consider as ""unfair competition"", bring back death penalty, that the victims should be part of the jury in some trials, cut all legal immigration, cut social aids to delinquent's families, automatic assumption of legitimate defence for policemen (when using violence), bring back military service, no more healthcare for foreigners, no reimbursing for abortion, women with young children will get financial help so that they don't have to work (but only for women), less foreign language classes in school, metal detectors in secondary and high schools, physically destroy schools with the most problems to built them a bit further…

true,SimonGray,DENK,Nørrebro,"&gt;My problem with pinyin is that it's strongly based on English spelling, which is quite different from the spelling of other languages that use latin characters. For example, I understand that you don't pronounce the final e? So is ""he"" pronounced as ""hé"" or ""hö"" or ""h"" or something else...?

""e"" is pronounced exactly one way and no other way. I'm not sure why you think it isn't pronounced?

And remember, ""e"" is distinct from ""en"" - maybe that's why you're confused? Pinyin syllables always consist of exactly one final and most often also an initial.

&gt;They should've taken some better system, like a combination of German and Croatian, and added tonal marks like the Vietnamese did. That would've made the whole thing a lot easier for non-English speakers since that way more sounds would be covered (for example, write či instead of chi).

That's just your own language bias showing. Pinyin is fine as a system for describing Mandarin sounds - it's internally consistent and that is what really matters. I'm not sure why writing ""č"" is easier than writing ""ch"" - they both seem about the same. The reason why ""ch"" might be better is because you already have the 4 tone marks as accents on every syllable, so adding more accents would make it awfully cluttered.",0,1327032028,null,0,true,0,c3ira05,t3_ondp3,t1_c3ira05,t1_c3inoij,null,1428207200,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

This movie is indeed blowing things a bit out of proportion. First of all, he disguised as a very dark black man. You must not forget - we don't have any black history whatsoever, so you really stick out and people tend to look in most places. Middle-eastern is a completely different story.

Second, this movie is made and cut with the purpose of showing the dark, racist side. As you can see, he's dealing with drunk soccer fans on a train somewhere in the Berlin-Area. Like mostly everywhere, drunk soccer fans are a very special kind of people. In the text it says he had bad experiences ""visiting owners of small gardens (lacking translation here) and shepard dog breeders"" - these are maybe the most closed-minded conservative groups of people you can find. Hell, they would be angry with you just for being just about anything that's not to their ""normal"" standards. 

So yes, it's a bit like filming Borat in Alabama. If you're looking for trouble in the right places, you can find it. Not that we don't have our decent share of assholes, but they are a minority and heavily frowned upon.

Soooooo where I am going with this? I think you should come! Germany's lovely, Frankfurt's a great place (there used to be a lot of US Army stationed there) and people are used to middle eastern looks. Don't worry too much. :)

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;My problem with pinyin is that it's strongly based on English spelling, which is quite different from the spelling of other languages that use latin characters. For example, I understand that you don't pronounce the final e? So is ""he"" pronounced as ""hé"" or ""hö"" or ""h"" or something else...?

I think you might be thinking of one of the other, older Romanization systems. In Taiwan, some relics of those systems (Wade-Giles, particularly) remain in metro system signs. In America, the easiest example that comes to mind is ""Szechuan"" when the modern system would write it as ""Sichuan"". ""he"" would always be pronounced (from the English-perspective) like ""huh"". In pinyin, we can manually mark the tone with numbers, e.g. he1, he2, he3, or he4, but it usually isn't necessary because it's possible to pull the tones from context.

&gt;They should've taken some better system, like a combination of German and Croatian, and added tonal marks like the Vietnamese did. That would've made the whole thing a lot easier for non-English speakers since that way more sounds would be covered (for example, write či instead of chi).

English is a lingua franca, and Chinese students who learn a foreign language usually learn English. The Latin alphabet without diacritic marks is familiar to students and is available on all computer keyboards. The overlap is also nice because Chinese people who can type quickly in English on QWERTY can type just as quickly in Chinese. (In fact, despite my being a native speaker and knowing the traditional zhuyin system, I exclusively type in pinyin because it's so quick.)

With reference to:

""I expect the debate over British membership of the EU to grow ever louder in Britain in the months to come, thanks largely to a Conservative Party left ravenous for more Eurosceptic red meat after December's summit.""

I very much agree, but it won't just be the Conservative party.

In the months ahead, as communique after treaty-draft poses and suggests ever more intrusive measures to make a fiscal union work, it will become apparent to the electorate at large that Britain can no longer 'lead' in the EU without joining a federal union.

By the same token it will become ever more more risible when politicians of a europhile stripe make veiled allusions to leading within the EU, standing at the helm, and other such intangible metaphors.

What are the consequences of this fantasy they hold to; are they willing to turn to the British public and admit the price, the loss of sovereignty, involved in joining France and Germany at the helm of europe?

I ask them to be honest about the implications of these pious mutterings; are they willing to state plainly to the electorate the consequence of being in the first tier, i.e. being in the euro and a driving force in further federalism?

If europe is determined to make the monetary union work, and that is their choice, then it will demand a fiscal and transfer union too.

For this to be a legitimate in the eyes of the europe's peoples it will require governance that is representative and legitimate, and recognised as such by the peoples of europe.

This is called political union, and if the British people cannot consent to it then we have no place in an EU that is a federated body!",0,1327062374,null,0,true,0,c3iu5gr,t3_oooug,t1_c3iu5gr,t3_oooug,null,1428208608,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Note that the EU commission had no arguments about the laws concerning civil rights and media freedoms.

I will however indulge you and answer the links that you have posted. I hope that you will appreciate this effort and stop your smear campaign against a country you're not familiar with.

Your first link claims that the Hungaian government tolerates paramilitary organizations that are anti-Roma. I will quote from that same article:

&gt; The first move [of the minister of interior] was against the Defense Force. They arrested eight members, including Tamás Eszes, the head of the organization, shown being led away on the photo. Moreover, the government published an ordinance: from here on any person who appears in uniform will be fined 100,000 forints. 

Your second link is about the *only* major protest the Orban government had since it came to power. It seems to represent this one protest as if the majority of the people is dissatisfied, when in fact most of these people were sympathizers of the opposition Socialist party. Note that there hasn't been any such protests since, for the simple reason because the Socialist party cannot afford to bring all of its sympathizers out on the streets, and the population is not outraged enough to do it on their own. Compare this to the OWS protests which aren't organized by any of the major parties of the US.

About your third article, unfortunately I don't speak German, but from what I can understand from Google Translate, this is a journalist complaining about the ""long arms"" of the ruling party. Ironically this guy works for the state radio, and he's being allowed to write these kind of stuff by the same ""oppressive"" party without getting fired. In any case, if he feels he's being oppressed, then that's his personal opinion and it doesn't prove anything regarding the general state of affairs in the country.

Your last link is by the same guy that made that factual error about the Roma people. In his first sentence he reveals himself to be a supporter of the socialists and the former prime minister. If you then look at his other articles you'll see that he attacks everything that is ""right"" (as opposed to the political left), so by this time I'm not sure if I should continue reading what is obviously a political propaganda, but anyways... 

It's an article restating old news, that the EU commission isn't happy about a few issues (that Orban has since promised to amend). And then I got to this part

&gt; Up to now Viktor Orbán hasn't tried to organize a pro-government demonstration because apparently the administration fears that the crowd might not be as big as they would like.

C'mon, you really expect me to take this kind of garbage as argument?

----

I went to a TEFL course to become certified. www.teflinbcn.com 
The course was ok, a bit tedious but taught me a ton about grammar. A lot of my fellow students complained, but they're kinda just weak bitches. I'd pay just to get a certificate, if I have to sit in a classroom for 5-6 hours a day and then get drunk at night in Barcelona, I'll do it. They also help you to find a place to live during your course, if you want it. They have you teach about 6 45minute lessons over the 4 weeks, which is very helpful.

It will be easier to get work if you have a work visa. If your father was born in Spain you might have a decent chance of getting an EU visa, I'm not sure. A kid from my class had a grandfather born in Estonia, went to the embassy or something or other and within a day or two had an EU Visa. However, it is not super hard to get work without one. You won't really be able to get a job at a super nice academy or some such, because they will want you to be legal and have a work Visa. But, many academies in the city will hire you without one, granted you have a TEFL certification or something equal and can speak and interview well, you can get a job. A LOT of people opt for private lessons, which basically end up being a lot of conversations over coffee. You'll find a lot of people speak English moderately well (at least those looking for lessons), and don't want exercises but just want to chat. I have a lot of friends who just choose to do private lessons because they prefer the lifestyle. Some are able to make 1500euros a month through this lifestyle. 

As for apartments, I think the best site would be loquo.com although the sites linked elsewhere in this post are fine as well. I just find that most people use loquo, it is a type of spanish craigslist. You can expect to spend between 250-600 euros for a place, although the average is between 300-400. You can look for a single bed with a tiny window and get it for maybe 280. Or a double bed with a bigger window or even a private small balcony (if you're lucky) for 350-450. These are all shared places in an apartment with other people. however, I would recommend this as it will help your spanish tremendously and your social life. Search posts in loquo with an english word ""bed"" or ""double"" or something and you will get posts returned that are written in spanish and english. so you know that the person offering the room can communicate in some English. Be prepared to spend a week or two looking for a place, although you can get lucky. I find Spanish people prefer to take their time in making a decision, which is not a bad thing, but just different. 

Food can be expensive, but you will just have to get used to buying groceries. If you made 1000euros a month you could live decently comfortable as long as you manage money well. You probably couldn't make enough money to live in your own place right away. Maybe after you have been here a few months and have a set income coming in. But it all just depends on your ability to be a go getter and such.

Whatever your take is on the issue of Sinti and Roma or the laws concerning civil liberties, a few things stand out and are indisputable: There is a growing sentiment and racism in some parts of the Hungarian population, there is a stifling economic situation and there is a growing opposition to the far right conservative government.

However you want to assess the situation and whoever you are blaming for the issues, these problems remain and are not only anti Hungarian propaganda, as you claim.

But moving away from Hungary and to the problems Turkey is facing today, the situation with the PKK is very similar to Spains issue with ETA or Britains issue with the IRA a few decades ago. Violence and counter violence, terrorist attacks and crackdowns. The oppression of minorities and the restriction of cultural heritage.

Turkey is not so different from many EU members 30 years ago. That's why I think Turkey has to be given a fair chance to enter the EU. If the integration process is approached correctly, the EU could improve the situation of many Kurds in Turkey. We could be a leading force to promote freedom and liberties.

And looking back, the EU has been an incentive to encourage liberal policies in Turkey. Turkey has improved the situation for the Kurdish minority quite considerably in the last few years. It is a positive development that continues to progress and the EU can be a helpful hand.

There is (and was) no requirement for media organizations to maintain ""balanced reporting"", and it was never prescribed by the media law. That is a commonly repeated false accusation

Huh? What are you talking about?

No fines can be applied for infringements of the balanced coverage provision, but it certainly exists:

**Act CIV of 2010 on the freedom of the press and the fundamental rules on media content** (also known as ""The Press Freedom Act"" or the ""media constitution"")

**Article 13:**

&gt;Linear media services engaged in the provision of information shall provide comprehensive, factual, up-to-date, objective and balanced coverage on local, national and European issues that may be of interest for the general public and on any event bearing relevance to the citizens of the Republic of Hungary and the members of the Hungarian nation"".

Article 12 of the Media Act confirms that:

&gt;(1) The information provision activities of media services shall comply with the obligation set forth under Article 13 of the Press Freedom Act.
&gt;
&gt;(2) Subject to the nature of the programmes, the balanced nature of communication shall be ensured within the given programme or in the series of programmes that appear regularly.
&gt;
&gt;(3) Save for the explanation of the news, employees of a media service provider appearing regularly in the programmes offering news and political information as presenters, newsmen or correspondents may not add any opinion or evaluative explanation to the political news appearing in the programme aired by any media service provider.

Article 181 of the Media Act specifies the ""Proceedings in Case of Infringement of the Obligation of Balanced Coverage"". Basically, either the Media Authority or the Media Council (depending on the type of media) can investigate media for infringements to the balanced coverage provision, and force them to ""broadcast or publish the decision passed by the Authority or the notice defined in the decision, without any assessing comment thereon, as provided for in the decision of the Authority, in the manner and at the time specified by the Authority, or shall provide an opportunity for the applicant to present his/her viewpoint.""

No fines can be applied for breaking the rule on balanced coverage itself; but depending on your reading it seems still possible for the Media Authority to impose stiff fines on the media if they refuse to broadcast its decision as per above. 

Much more importantly, stiff fines can still be applied for infringements of any of the other myriad content regulations. For example, media services can be sanctioned harshly for content which was found to ""discriminate persons, nations, communities, national, ethnic, linguistic and other minorities or any majority as well as any church or religious groups"" or content that ""offends or excludes persons, nations, communities, national, ethnic, linguistic and other minorities or any majority as well as any church or religious groups.""

How do you interpret this sentence: ""A kiegyensúlyozott tájékoztatás kötelezettségének megsértése miatt a Hatóság hivatalból nem indíthat eljárást."" Which means that the media authority cannot start an investigation into some balanced reporting by its own. There has to be someone, who has to request, and on whose behalf the investigation is done.

Then, a bit further in the law, there is a provision, that any party can request from a court that the decision of the media authority be overruled.

Before this law, anyone with objection on media reporting could go to the court directly (as it happened multiple times) and request that a correction be published, that anyone can do even now. But if you contact the media authority first, then its the media authority that does an investigation first, but then any party can go to court later, just as before. So why is this new procedure worse than the one before? Remember, the media authority cannot start investigations by its own.

But that is all theory. You might know what was happening in Slovakia, when they passed a similar law. There was multiple of cases when politicians were suing journalists out of their money.

I disagree. There always has been racism in some parts of the Hungarian population, but I think that it has been declining in the last 50 or so years.

&gt;Thank you for your email regarding the UK-US extradition laws, and the case of Richard O'Dwyer.

&gt;I am very concerned about these cases and have been involved in the case of Babar Ahmad who has already spent a number of years in custody. I attend both recent Parliamentary debates on the issue of extradition and spoke at the first. Indeed at this debateThe Commons agreed without a vote to call on ministers to bring forward new laws and attempt to change the UK-US extradition treaty and the European arrest warrant.

&gt;Labour passed the Extradition Act in 2003, which was intended for terror suspects and never cases like that of Richard O'Dwyer. However as I am not a member of the Government I cannot enact the Forum Amendment, this would need to be enacted by the current administration.
