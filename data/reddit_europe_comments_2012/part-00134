true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"I can give you some advice for France, but I'll consider that you have at least a week to visit the country :

-Do not miss the Mont Saint Michel in Normandy, at any cost. It's the absolute best tourist destination ever. Maybe visit that site in the morning and noon, and take the rest of the day to visit the Normandy region in general, which is nice cow-country, true rural France (also, there are the WW2 beaches - with German bunkers and all, and allied cemeteries, which may interest you if you're American).

-Hit the ""Chateaux de la Loire"", or ""Loire Castles"" in English I guess - those are essentially beautiful, lush and rich Renaissance castles along the Loire river which is center-west of France. There are tons of them but maybe you should take a few days to see the most highly regarded ones (internet search). It's a nice region to cruise through too.

-In Paris, which is the obvious destination, check out the Père Lachaise cemetery (do an internet search to fidn the graves of famous people). Perhaps, you can also take a bateau mouche, those are pretty nice because many of the most beautiful buildings are along the Seine river :
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateau_mouche

Otherwise, visit the Notre Dame Cathedral, walk the steps of Montmartre, and if you like crowded massively huge museums, I guess you need to go to the Louvre. Also, there are places that tourists tend to not visit much : the ""Panthéon"", which features the graves of famous French people like Voltaire or Hugo, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panth%C3%A9on,_Paris , or ""Les Invalides"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Invalides which is a War museum and houses the tomb of Napoleon. In terms of security, you might want to avoid North-Eastern Paris which are the poorer parts - most aren't slums, but I guess you're more likely to get mugged there than in the other parts (I've gone there hundreds of times and have never gotten mugged, so don't be too paranoid, it's just the least sure places in the city).

-If you want to check out the Mediterranean coast, avoid Marseilles, go to Cannes or Nice, or even Monaco (which is a separate country, as you surely know).

There, that should give you a broad idea of the country. Obviously, you won't have enough time to see less well-known things.",0,1349049650,null,0,1349050164,0,c6fqqit,t3_10p8l0,t1_c6fqqit,t3_10p8l0,null,1430031260,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I knew very little French, but a few crash courses before I left helped a lot. The French don't like to speak English, even if they know how. Making an honest effort to speak French was appreciated. It shouldn't be too difficult for a Canadian, but I've heard that Canadian accents are pretty strange to the French.

&gt;- The architecture of the buildings in the city are amazingly beautiful. 

&gt;- People are very friendly. Forget about the stereotypical rude Parisian. They have been nothing but nice and accommodating.

&gt;- If you know how to say 'bon jour' and 'merci', that's enough. The minute you try to say 'bon jour', they know you don't speak French and they will help you along.

&gt;- The wine is delicious. Even if you don't like wine (like myself), do yourself a favor and try it. 

&gt;- The night life is great. If you are young and good looking, you'll love it. Parisian women are beautiful, and that's an understatement. Then men are good looking too, speaking objectively.

&gt;- The touristy sites are crowded (no surprise) and it really takes the specialness out of it.


Agreed.

&gt;- The French are annoyingly polite. We've all heard about it, but now that I'm here I am damn sick of the words 'bon jour' and 'merci'. i hate that pressure to be polite, and if you're not they will throw it in your face.

I'm not sure I agree with this. The level of politeness here is about the same as in the southeast US or southern California. The only that phases me is the timing of the ""bonjour"". I'm used to saying it when I get to the cashier, not when I enter the store. What's the rule if the proprietor is already talking to someone when I walk in? It feels rude to interrupt a conversation like that. 

&gt;- Parisians walk fast. Everyone seems to be in a rush to get where they're going. Relax already!

As others have pointed out, they have a reason to walk fast. To any tourists: please think about where you stop! The person behind you is not expecting you to stop at the top of the metro stairs to get your bearings, so march on over to a lamppost or something and stop there.

&gt;- If you are overweight, you will be very uncomfortable in Paris. Everything is small, and some people will look at you like a freak show attraction.

&gt;- Everyone dresses nice in Paris. That's a bad thing because I don't like to dress up.

There are definitely fat and dressed-down Parisians. I think you might be a bit oversensitive.

As for dress, I think the lower bound is higher in Paris, but that's it. I was kind of a slob in the US, so I have dressed up a tiny bit (darker jeans, button-down shirts) in Paris. My peers haven't changed their dress at all from the US, and I don't think they stand out at all.

&gt;- I've not been that impressed by the food. Go to a diverse city in the U.S., such as NYC, and you will find much better food.

Partially agreed. The food is interesting and good, but so is similarly-priced food everywhere. And you have to look pretty hard for food that isn't French or Middle Eastern.",0,1349052641,null,0,false,0,c6frg29,t3_10pqlg,t1_c6frg29,t3_10pqlg,null,1430031660,2,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,2

The winner of each four ball and foursome match gets one point (half for ties) so there is a total of eight points for each of the first two days.

The last day (Sunday) they play match play, where each member of team Europe gets matched with a member of team US. Each match is worth one point, so there's a total of 12 points up for grabs on Sunday (thus 28 total).

Match play golf is where you only count how many holes you 'win' against your opponent. So if you make your third shot and your opponent misses, you win the hole. Doesn't matter if it would have taken him 4 shots or 10, every hole is worth one. This also means if you're ""3 up"" with 2 holes to go, the match is over, you win 3 &amp; 2.

Unfortunately this might turn out to be false, as I understand it Switzerland and Norway both contribute a lot of money to the EU as part of some treaty of free trade/free movement of people or something.

**Edit: I forgot to add another point to the discussion, which is the MASSIVE trade deficit the UK has with the EU. For the rest of the EU the exit of the UK would be quite unpleasant:**

&gt;The UK remains a net importer (imports are greater than exports). The size of difference between imports and exports (£5.3 billion) has increased by 10.0 per cent compared to June 2012, but when compared to July 2011 the gap has increased by 18.9 per cent. This is the largest monthly difference in recent years.

https://www.uktradeinfo.com/statistics/euoverseastrade/Pages/EuOTS.aspx

These numbers are of course not normal (generally they'd be a lot lower) and I'm having to guess here... £5.3bn deficit in July, so 12*5.3 = 63.6, £63.6bn(79.6bn Euro) annual deficit, that's a lot of businesses dependent on UK consumers.

true,SethLeBatard,Bretagne,Bretagne,"Je n'ai pas de problème spécifique avec la démocratie mais plutôt avec le suffrage universel. Il me parait absolument irresponsable de laisser la possibilité de voter à des gens qui ne comprennent pas ou ne s'intéressent pas à la politique, à l'économie, etc... Je pense qu'il faudrait un ""examen"" concernant les institutions et les programmes politiques pour déterminer qui peut voter et qui ne peut pas. Les idées politiques des candidats ne seraient évidemment pas évaluées, seulement leur compréhension des enjeux et de ce qui est propose, ainsi que les conditions, etc... Pour être tout à fait honnête, le véritable problème tient plutôt de l'éducation que du suffrage universel en tant que concept. Si les gens sont éduqués politiquement et économiquement, sans abrutissement et idéologie, alors je serais absolument d'accord. Mais je pense que tout le monde s'accordera pour dire que ce n'est pas le cas aujourd'hui. Et je m'étonne que tout le monde approuve tout le temps ce suffrage alors même que tout le monde s'accorde à dire que l'effet de groupe rend souvent la masse imbécile. Ce n'est pas parce que tout le monde dit une chose et décide de faire quelque chose, que cette fameuse chose est bonne pour le pays et pour le peuple. D'ailleurs, je tiens à rappeler que nous ne sommes pas en démocratie mais en République, ce qui est différent. Notre république use de démocratie mais peu la limiter pour des principes allant à l'encontre des idéaux républicains. 


Pour ce qui est du césarisme, je dirais qu'un césarisme moderne serait défini par un leader fort ayant un grand pouvoir exécutif tirant sa légitimité d'une élection de gens éduqués et responsables. Ce leader serait en place pour un temps déterminé (entre 7 et 10 ans par exemple) suffisamment long pour agir mais assez court pour limiter son pouvoir dans le temps. Je dis un leader fort pour l'exécutif (pour le législatif aussi d'ailleurs) car il me parait difficile pour nos dirigeants aujourd'hui de diriger le pays avec tous les contrepouvoirs en place, légitimes ou non. Ainsi le président peut se trouver immobiliser par l'assemblée ou le sénat et ne pas pouvoir faire les réformes nécessaires. 
En contrepartie, le dirigeant élu devrait être tenu pour responsable. C'est à dire qu'on ferait un bilan de son travail à la fin de sa mandature en le comparant avec ses promesses électorales. En fonction de ce qui a été fait ou non, celui ci serait éventuellement condamné à de lourdes amendes et/ou à des peines de prison ferme. Cela limiterai drastiquement les promesses fallacieuses et le populisme mensonger. 
Bien sur, il resterait une assemblée nationale, etc... Il ne s'agit pas des mettre en place un dictateur mais un dirigeant fort, légitime , honnête, responsable mais disposant de suffisamment de pouvoir pour exécuter ce qu'il a promis au peuple.

C'est un très court résume d'un césarisme moderne et j'ai conscience que cela peut choquer. Mais je dois dire que je réprouve notre république, et son système éducatif qui ressemble à un formatage institutionnel. Point de liberté de penser, l'histoire est transformée en roman national destine à glorifier la république, etc...

&gt; [...]

&gt; Last week investors – and Spanish journalists – suddenly discovered to their horror that Germany will not after all allow Spain to dump the risk of its banks on to the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone rescue fund. That seems to contradict the June 29 eurozone leaders’ summit statement, which said it was “imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns”.

&gt; [...]

&gt; This is how I would summarise the German position:

&gt;* First, we do not really want a banking union all, but if we have to have it, we would like to limit the remit of the pan-European supervisor to a few large cross-border banks.

&gt;* Second, ideally the supervisor should not be the ECB; if it has to be the ECB, there must be safeguards, stronger than those proposed, to ensure that monetary policy remains independent from the banking supervisor.

&gt;* Third, there shall be no joint deposit insurance.

&gt;* Fourth, the banking union shall not deal with any legacy risk, only problems that arise in the future. The Spanish bank programme remains a Spanish bank programme.

&gt;* Fifth, the ESM should not be able to undertake direct bank recapitalisations until the banking union is fully implemented. This will take many years.

&gt; Whether or not you call this a banking union, or a breach of the June 29 agreement, is irrelevant. The point is that you cannot force through a banking union against the explicit will of the German government, the German parliament, the German public at large and the Bundesbank. I suspect the EU will ultimately agree on a fudge. But it would be irrelevant for the resolution of this crisis.

&gt; [...]

&gt; Whenever the ECB helps, the political process slows down. This is the true tragedy of the eurozone’s crisis management.

&gt; According to legend, the flag was already invented by Duke Leopold V of Austria as a consequence of his fighting during the Siege of Acre. After a fierce battle, his white surcoat was completely drenched in blood. When he removed his belt, the cloth underneath was untouched by it, revealing the combination of red-white-red. So taken was he by this singular sight that he adopted the colors and scheme as his banner. The incident was documented as early as 1260, though it is highly unlikely.

But the truth is we just took it from the Holy Roman Empire

&gt; In fact, the war flag of the Holy Roman Empire during the Crusades was a silver cross on a red field quite similar to the later Austrian arms. This ensign was used by the Austrian capital Vienna from the late 13th century onwards.

Blue and white symbolizes the sea and the sky. The blue stripes correspond to the syllables e-le-fthe-ri-a, which means ""freedom"", and the white stripes to the syllables i-tha-na-tos, which means ""or death"". ""Freedom or death"" was the  main slogan of the greek revolution in 1821.

1. German flag

This comes from the colours the ""all-German"" regiments in the Napoleonic wars branded and the ""Vielvölkerschlacht"" (a battle) in the early 19th century. As student associations adopted these colours and those associations in turn became one of the driving forces behind liberalism and nationalism in 19th century Germany, the colours were adopted to represent a unified German state. 

They were not adopted by the German Empire because they used Prussian colours, as Bismarck wanted to have a Germany under Prussia. However, they were then used in the Weimar Republic, which essentially has the same flag and emblem as the current Federal Republic of Germany.

As a side note, one should recognise that the Federal Republic is now by far the longest continuous German nation state, as the DRG was only assimilated, and neither used to create a new state nor grant a new basic law.

2. Union Jack (Funny that the German flag has no .. name, I guess?)

Easy. It's the English, Scottish and Irish flags punched together. This comes from the fact that with the act of Union from 1707 the English and Scottish Kingdom became the United Kingdom of England, Wales and Scotland, while the Irish were added in 1801 (IIRC).

So you *obviously* wanted a flag that left out the Welsh (since that was regarded as being part of England for too long to be a separate nation), yet included the Scottish and Irish flags, as those were separate Kingdoms. The Scottish flag at that time is the one they use now, while the Irish one was white with a red St. Andrew's cross in the middle.

Edit: Damn it, the second act of union was in 1800, but it was *enacted* on 1st January 1801. And the Irish flag is called St. Patrick's cross, but I am rather sure that the *type* of cross that is on it is called St. Andrew's cross, which is also the name of the Scottish flag. And the English flag is of course St. George's Cross.",0,1349097353,null,0,1349097654,0,c6fydqm,t3_10r90p,t1_c6fydqm,t3_10r90p,null,1430034934,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

There was Russian hunter in woods, who, after a long day hunting potato and bear, was in the middle of immense forest. Was getting dark, and having lost his bearings, he decided to head in one direction until was clear of the increasingly oppressive capitalist foliage. After what seemed like many hour, he come across a cabin in small clearing. Realizing how dark like heart of Westerner it was, he decided to see if he could stay there for the night. He approached, and found the door open. Nobody inside. The hunter flopped down on the single bed, deciding to explain himself to owner in the morning.

He looked around the inside of the cabin, he was surprised to see the walls adorned by several portraits, all painted in incredible detail. All were staring down at him, their features twisted into looks of hatred and malice like criminal Ronald Reagan. Staring back, he grew increasingly uncomfortable. Making a concerted effort to ignore many hateful faces, he turned to face the wall, and exhausted, he fell into a restless sleep.

The next morning, brave hunter of USSR woke -- he turned, blinking in sunlight. Looking up, he discovered that cabin had no portraits, only windows.

Note though, that many places see it as high season, so accommodation is quite costly during this time.  You will notice this when you look at apartments.  

Shops are open in 24 December.  Many close early.  You'll find cafes, restaurants and coffee shops open on 25 December.  

Public transport runs on a Sunday time table, but at least you can get  around using the buses, Metro and RER.  

It gets very busy in Paris during this time and as a result, it can be a bit frustrating, especially around the department stores.

Do you really think the sea change in the last twenty years happened naturally?

The banks and the corrupt governments of these third world nations have conspired to make it nearly impossible for these nations to have a comfortable standard of living. What's happening in Greece happened in those nations decades ago.

It's inevitable that organizations like The Golden Dawn will rise under these conditions. More will come.

Sooner or late the vast majority of people will embrace their human nature and put an end to the current state of affairs. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when.

true,dreugeworst,NETH,The Netherlands,"Complicated, perhaps, but clearly the colours as such were in use since long before the French revolution. So although similar, the flags are probably not meant to be related.

taken from your link:

&gt; After 1630, the orange stripe was gradually replaced by a red one, as paintings of that time indicate. 
&gt;Since there was likely no political reason for introducing a non-orange motif in the flag, the probable reason is that orange and blue are faint colors and more difficult to distinguish than red and dark blue, especially at sea. 
&gt;Another explanation is that the orange was originally made of a blend of yellow and red vegetable dyes, with the yellow colour fading out first, leaving a red strip.

and

&gt;However, it seems more probable that this version of the colours is a variant of the original red-white-blue associated with Holland and Frisia since long before. 
&gt;These three colours go back to Charlemagne's time, the 9th century.

The stuff you can get in supermarkets may not suit your needs, because its very low dosed.

In Germany there are three ways medications can be labeled. (dietary supplements counting as medication here)

*Freiverkäuflich* - ""free for sale"", thats the stuff you can get at the supermarket around the corner. Far less than everywhere else in europe. Interesting for you: Only low dosed dietary supplements count as those.

*Apothekenpflichtig* - ""pharmacy-bound"" still for sale for everyone, but only available in pharmacies. Here you will find most vitamins and stuff like this, but note that it may have a different name. Try your luck at a pharmacy near you. Try to explain what ingredients you are looking for rather than telling (english/american) product names. They will try to help you and explain regulations and will be able to find what you are looking for. (eg. how it is wrapped and how much) These are most of the medications you will maybe miss in german supermarkets compared to those in the uk.

*Rezeptpflichtig* - ""prescription only"" For these kind of medication, a doctor has to prescribe it. Maybe some of the things you are looking for falls in this category. Then you have to visit a doctor. A normal GP is the best start. He either will prescript it or he will transfer you to a doctor better suited to your problem.

My advice is: Go to a pharmacy and explain to them what you are looking for. As I said above, try to tell them wich ingredients you want, if they can't help with the product names. They will help you and when you are looking for something *rezeptpflichtig*, they will know.

Please excuse my violation of the english language ;)

&gt; First, we do not really want a banking union all, but if we have to have it, we would like to limit the remit of the pan-European supervisor to a few large cross-border banks.

This is simply open to dispute and should probably be considered a bargaining position of Germany and will most likely be subject to change.

&gt; Second, ideally the supervisor should not be the ECB; if it has to be the ECB, there must be safeguards, stronger than those proposed, to ensure that monetary policy remains independent from the banking supervisor.

Ditto.

&gt; Third, there shall be no joint deposit insurance.

Of course not! If I'm not totally wrong, we're currently the only ones who actually a working and filled fund that has been built up in *decades*, mainly by our smaller banks. There would be an *outrage* like you've never heard if that money would now be used to bail out Greek or Spanish deposits.

&gt; Fourth, the banking union shall not deal with any legacy risk, only problems that arise in the future.

This one I really don't understand, because that indeed seemed to be the whole point of the whole charade on June 29th. Who actually said that?

&gt; Fifth, the ESM should not be able to undertake direct bank recapitalisations until the banking union is fully implemented. This will take many years.

Well, duh. You might wish us to drop billions into the Spanish banking system without any safeguards, but that hopefully ain't gonna happen.

I mean, just look at how panic-y Rajoy is trying to not lay his cards (the actual state of the Spanish banking industry) on the table, you might understand this reluctance.

Edit:

Oh and look what I found in the comments:

""WHEN an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, for banks in the euro area the ESM COULD, following a regular DECISION, have the possibility to recapitalize banks directly. This would rely on appropriate CONDITIONALITY, including compliance with state aid rules, which should be institution specific, sector-specific or economy-wide and would be formalised in a Memorandum of Understanding.""

""When"", ""could"", ""decision"". This doesn't sound anything like ""Yeah! Let's all bail out Spanish banks with no guarantees!"".

And regarding the ""legacy problem"", the commenter was kind enough to add this:

The policy problem with including ""legacy"" issues is that EVERY country has those. So what should stop the German government from using the ESM to refinance German Landesbanken, Commerzbank or Hypo Real Estate? The only feasible way to avoid EVERY nation asking for a direct bailout is leaving the refinancing risk with the relevant sovereign - i.e. the ESM only provides the liquidity not available to (some) sovereigns on debt markets, the responsibility stays with the national governments who have a preference to maintain a nationally controlled banking sector.

White is supposed to come from the color of the White Eagle - when legendary father of Polish nation - Lech came to this land he seen White Eagle flying there - he said there will be his city and created Gniezno city (name comes from ""nest"" in Polish). Some versions of the legend says the eagle was circling high on the background of the red sunset, hence the white and red colors.

Other says that red background was used because the red pigment was very expansive then, and the prettiest red pigment was one of the export hits of old Poland (made from koszenila bug - we also have month named after that bug - czerwiec - June - because the bug was gathered that month). So white from eagle, red to show off that we are rich :)

During partitions of Poland red was supposed to stand for blood and courage and white for innocence/purity and wounds.

I'll just copy it here:

""WHEN an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, for banks in the euro area the ESM COULD, following a regular DECISION, have the possibility to recapitalize banks directly. This would rely on appropriate CONDITIONALITY, including compliance with state aid rules, which should be institution specific, sector-specific or economy-wide and would be formalised in a Memorandum of Understanding.""

""When"", ""could"", ""decision"". This doesn't sound anything like ""Yeah! Let's all bail out Spanish banks with no guarantees!"". Frankly, if Rajoy wanted to see this as a license to kill, it's his problem, not ours.

And regarding the ""legacy problem"", the commenter was kind enough to add this:
The policy problem with including ""legacy"" issues is that EVERY country has those. So what should stop the German government from using the ESM to refinance German Landesbanken, Commerzbank or Hypo Real Estate? The only feasible way to avoid EVERY nation asking for a direct bailout is leaving the refinancing risk with the relevant sovereign - i.e. the ESM only provides the liquidity not available to (some) sovereigns on debt markets, the responsibility stays with the national governments who have a preference to maintain a nationally controlled banking sector.",0,1349121688,null,0,false,0,c6g4bsr,t3_10r6y7,t1_c6g4bsr,t1_c6fxxtl,null,1430037800,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

What matters is that we don't see the anti austerity voices merely as the 'irresponsible' or the 'fanatic spenders'. The question is not between being 'good' and paying back, or being 'reckless' and don't. It's a question of how to tackle an economic crisis coinciding with a debt crisis. The EU firmly backs an option of budget discipline and spending cuts. It is backed by the creditors because they of course want their money back. It also favours a laissez faire approach and it has a tendency of bailing sectors out without demanding structural reforms.

The other side wants to 'solve' the crisis by massively investing in the economy. For them austerity is a destructive, backwards approach. But of course, you need money to invest. Not paying debts doesn't mean a bailout. A country can never go bankrupt and has other ways of obtaining cash. Money from banks can be 'borrowed', this is in fact simply the money of citizens which lies there being useless anyway. Another option is giving out IOU's.

Niveau UMP il n'y avait rien.

Au final, je crois que ni le PS, ni l'UMP n'ont véritablement proposé de programmes consistants. Chacun a joué avec ses petites marges de manœuvres symboliques (qui taxer à la marge, à qui redistribuer, et deux-trois trucs sociétaux qui ne coûtent rien, comme le mariage gay).

There's a reason why Weisswurst is traditionally served with a very mild sweet mustard, anything more and you completely overpower the sausage; ketchup and curry is exactly what the sausage doesn't need. Conversely, they picked one of the few sausages that doesn't work as a Currywurst, from a purely culinary stand point. You usually want to go with a pork sausage of some sort for Currywurst so the flavors balance out.

It seems to me to be a lack of basic culinary sense, lack of experience with German cuisine and probably some misguided stereotypes/enthusiasm about the Weisswurst.

The Nürburgring is in trouble because of the mismanagement and incompetence of German politicians. In 2009 the state paid 350 million Euro to add an amusement park to the track. The original plan was for the private owner to pay all of that back – however, the owner is now bankrupt and several more million Euro might have to be spent by the state in the future to save the track.

Greece has nothing whatsoever to do with the Nürburgring being in trouble (it’s not like the state couldn’t afford to bail the Nürburgring out because of the ESM) and Greece’s 30 million Euro subsidy is very tame in comparison to the subsidies the Nürburgring received.

true,foul-mouthed-lawyer,FRAN,France,"If the colors stood for anything, I'd vote for your explanation!

There's a lot of history behind the *drapeau tricolore*, but not much meaning in the colors themselves, sadly.

1. Colors of the kings

The traditional arms of the French kings are golden (stylized) lily flowers on a **blue background**. These are familial arms, while the color of the king as an individual is white.

Yes, the historical attested fact is that for centuries, **French armies fought under a white flag**. The US neocons have little knowledge of history and they missed that one.

2. Colors of Paris

The first colors for the city of Paris go back to the 11th century CE. As the capital city of the kingdom, it was granted a strip of the royal blue with lily flowers above a floating boat which referred to the wealth of the Parisian merchants.

No one knows why the boat was placed on a *red background*. Eventually, blue and red became recognized as the colors of Paris.

3. 14th century troubles

France almost became a constitutional monarchy during the 100-year war. At some point, the Parisian strongman, merchant provost Étienne Marcel, held the king hostage and forced him to watch the cold-blood murder of some members of the king's council. He then **forced the king to wear the blue-and-red hat** of the Parisian merchants party.

For various reasons, the crown regained power and France didn't get a constitution then.

(Actually, the French king was a prisoner of England and this happened to his eldest son who was acting as regent, but it's a detail.)

4. French Revolution

At one of the crisis points of the French Revolution in 1791, king Louis XVI was forced to go to the Paris city hall and it was planned to have him wear a similar blue-and-red hat as a reference to the 14th century crisis. **General Lafayette** (yes, the same one who had fought in the American revolutionary war), out of respect for the king, had white (the king's personal color) inserted between blue and red so that the humiliation would be less severe.

This was a great success, and the three colors remained associated with the country.

5. Bonus anecdote

After the 1870-1871 war between France and Prussia which ended the Second Empire, the plan was to reestablish a monarchy in France.

But it failed because the heir to the throne insisted on having the white flag as the national flag. This was unacceptable for many, and we eventually ended up with a republic.",0,1349165898,null,0,1349166083,0,c6gdv3v,t3_10r90p,t1_c6gdv3v,t1_c6fxvxu,null,1430042366,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Either you choose the unnecessary long pain of paying back without healthy income flow. Or you invest so you can pay back another time.

Lending money means inflation, but it's a source of money you can invest. And; it also means debt will be cheaper. That's why the EU hates inflation because the creditors don't want to be payed less.

But there are non inflationary ways of obtaining money. In the thirties; Nazi Germany was the only country that managed to escape the crisis before the war started. And it did this by ordering massive public works; but instead of paying them, they promised to pay them later. This way, the German minister of economy managed to invest for 10x the money that he had. Which yielded great results.

Another option is to enact a law that temporarily uses the savings of citizens (let's say 25%) to invest in the economy. This could yield some 1000 billion euros in the eurozone.

There is a third option; defaulting and nationalizing economies without indemnification. These options are radical. But the problem is, they will happen in Southern Europe if we continue the current course. There has been a lot of talk of the 'bitter pill' and the 'short pain', but there is no such thing. The pain will be long and not worth the effort.

This is untrue. When Europe was at its peak, say 1600-1900, feudalism was long dead in the successful nations. 

&gt; The point being, you can't just assume because something worked so well in the past it will continue to work as successfully in the future.

That's not the point here at all. The point is that centralisation and uniformity tend to stifle economies, as has been borne out by myriad overstretched empires of the past. To repeat the same mistakes, often with the same arguments and ideologies, especially during a crisis that has shown centralisation to hinder recovery in Europe (causing depression in at least three periphery states), seems to me to be rather a mistake.",0,1349169304,null,0,false,0,c6ge6vw,t3_10t35c,t1_c6ge6vw,t1_c6ge5um,null,1430042610,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

No dispute there - the single market, alongside I think defence, are areas where the UK is most enthusiastic to cooperate with the continent. And pretty much nobody expects them to cooperate in anything else, where they to stay in the EU or not.

&gt;Who, by abandoning fundamental EU principles, is guilty of Economic Dumping?

Not sure what you mean here - many countries, including the UK for Bulgaria and Romania (to its maximum even), used the transitionary measures to limit the movement of workers for a period of time. You'd call that dumping? Its a precautionary measure fearing more massive movement of workers than ever happened, so choosing to give the new member a bit more time for economic growth to limit the incentives for that, and ofc playing into the nationalist sentiments at home. But guilt? Whoever accused anyone of economic dumping, for you to be in search for the parties at fault?

I simply stated that whatever the future position UK chooses for itself, a mere free trade agreement (which is how the post I was replying could be interpreted - but in any case, is a clarification) is not an acceptable regime to me, and would insist that it continues to implement the single market rules if it wishes continued access to the EU's markets.

I expect you or the UK's public wouldn't consider that a form of punishment, to be so intent in establishing guilt? It really wasn't meant as punishment. Nor was my intent to accuse UK's current policy on free movement of workers of anything in this post - if anything I think Germany and Austria are the worst in that respect. 

Though lest one be left with the impression the UK is particularly more keen on free movement of workers than anyone else is, they do currently form the most entrenched opposition to a pan-EU professional ID system, suggested as part of the planned overhaul of the single market act, precisely for fears of further and easier immigration, having now the government they do.",0,1349171589,null,0,1349172420,0,c6gedmt,t3_10r2wm,t1_c6gedmt,t1_c6g7dw2,null,1430042703,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Their kids were chasing each other, half in half out of the water. Men were cooking octopus, Women were preparing Greek salads and all kinds of delicacies. It was all from the sea, their trees, gardens, animals and those of their neighbours. 

They invited us to join them. The mood was joyous. I asked them about the crisis in Greece. They kinda looked at me. Someone laughed. The father said: 

""***The crisis. Sure there is one. But look around you and look at us. We are ""Anthropoi"" (human beings). Now think of those poor slobs in their cubicles, drinking stale coffee and chewing on that disgusting donut or donut-like plastic crap they call food. They are basically corporate slaves in self-denial. But throughout their drone-like meaningless lives, they will think of themselves as lucky for being economically ""well off"". And indeed, they can buy stuff. They can for example buy a more expensive couch than us, a more expensive lamp, a more expensive car. But the things they buy are dead, material, soulless things. And in order to acquire them they have become somewhat dead, material, soulless things themselves. The crisis? Sure, it's awful. Have an olive!***""

There is nothing wrong with unemployment per se. 100% unemployment should actually be a goal. More of us could then become real human beings. Some would of course play games all the time (until they got tired of it I imagine), but many others would become philosophers, teachers, scientists, athletes and/or artists ([watch](http://youtu.be/I7PFB1xFrNo)).

How so? I'd think it's a good idea and the only real way to push the needed changes through. I mean, the other way would be to put the countries under direct supervision (by whom, exactly?

1. A substantial proportion of Barcelona's population comes from outside Catalunya and doesn't speak Catalan, so you will need Spanish to communicate with them.

2. If your Catalan is less than fluent, people tend to assume that it would be easier for you to talk in Spanish and switch to Spanish for your sake.

**This pisses me off** because this is one of those idiotically idealist things young people with zero life experience believe. Yet I keep seeing it repeted no matter how often I shoot it down. **PEOPLE PLEASE STOP REPEATING THIS CRAP ALREADY!** It is like everybody is made of fucking angels.

In reality the human soul is much darker.

The actual evidence of people with a lot of free time on their hands - like people living in slums with a lot of unemployment - is that most people, like, everybody but well educated intellectual people, so the majority, cannot use their time in a good way. They watch TV 14 hours a day, or hang around on streetcorners and cast menacing looks at passers by, get bored, and they find only destructive ways to alleviate that boredom, alcohol, drugs, fights, indiscriminate, unprotected drunken sex leading to unwanted parenthoods, gangsterism etc. etc. This you can see everywhere where you go to place a lot of people have too much free time from the Paris banlieaus to Detroit or Harlem. 

This is well document in books like

http://www.amazon.com/Life-Bottom-Worldview-Makes-Underclass/dp/1566635055/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349182112&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=theodore+dalrymple+life+at+the+bottom

Out of 10 people, there will be one intellectual who will use free time correctly and another 9 idiots who will just get bored and fuck stuff up for fun.

Everybody who has this stupid fucking idea should go to some ghetto in their city and ask those teenage gangstas hanging out on street corners and talkin shit to people why don't they engage in philosophy, arts or athletics instead if they have so much free time on ther hands. The beating that ensue will be very educative and stop this dumbass idiotism.

I am so angry I don't know what to say. People like this, idealists without experience, screw up the world, because they keep removing traditional ways to control and suppress the evil in human nature which they do not understand.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;But there are non inflationary ways of obtaining money. In the thirties; Nazi Germany was the only country that managed to escape the crisis before the war started. And it did this by ordering massive public works; but instead of paying them, they promised to pay them later. This way, the German minister of economy managed to invest for 10x the money that he had. Which yielded great results.

Germany did not escape the crises. In fact, it was Heinrich Brünings measures, that brought von Papen, and ultimately Hitler, to power. Not that Brüning had any choice really. Anyway, I don't really think it is very relevant to compare with a dictatorship in the 1930's.

&gt;I don't like to compare small scale transactions with countries; but if you are in debt without a good income flow, you have two choices. Either you choose the unnecessary long pain of paying back without healthy income flow. Or you invest so you can pay back another time.

I also feel uneasy with this comparison. For one thing, at least in theory, central banks can print as much money as they want. But what you mostly do not mention is *where are the money to invest going to come from*? 

Who is going to lend southern Europe money? The banks? Nevermind that at least in the Greek case there is absolutely no lending, everyone knows that Greece isn't really going to pay back, so at least in Greeks case it is giving them money. 

So, who do you suggest is going to ""lend"" southern Europe the money? Are they going to borrow it themselves? Sure, I do not mind that, it is their finances, but I do not think it is not very likely. 

&gt;Another option is to enact a law that temporarily uses the savings of citizens (let's say 25%) to invest in the economy. This could yield some 1000 billion euros in the eurozone.

That is never, ever going to work. It goes against all freedoms, ever, and thinking that a Finn will not be able to touch their money to hand over more money to the Greeks......No, no, no.

&gt;There is a third option; defaulting and nationalizing economies without indemnification

Or, leaving the Euro.

Personally, I think countries will have to leave the Euro. It was contructed incorrectly from the beginning, but nothing is helped by creating permanent transfers, which is essentially what is being suggested (the loans are not loans). Whether it is northern or southern Europe who starts remains to be seen.

I don't think the austerity measures are ideal either (in fact, I don't think our economic system is ideal, in particular with regards to environmental issues, but that is a whole different discussion :-) ), but I do not see how you can force countries to pay for other countries, basically permanently (lets face it, Greece/Spain/Portugal has received money since they joined the EU, and southern Italy is hardly going to be a productive member soon). The willingness is not there, for a lot of reasons. 

The Euro was wrongly constructed from the beginning. Maybe it is better to dismantle it and start fresh. What they are doing now is building on sand, it will never last.

Germany escaped the crisis in 38, thanks to the policy of Hjalmar Schacht. There's no reason not to compare a dictatorship with our current model as long as the comparison is valid.

Brilliant, let's invade the Czech republic. Are you going to compare the economy of Germany *one year* before the biggest war the world has seen, when they were building up to take over Europe, with the year 2012? I do not think that is a good comparison. Sure, we could  spend 20 % of our GDP on military spendings, invade Turkey or Russia, and there will be less unemployment, but it will be a lot of destruction.And, ask the US, spending a lot of money on the military (which Germany definately did in 1938) isn't all that cracked up to be.

&gt;It goes against no freedoms at all. A temporary use of a small part of savings during a time of crisis isn't any less autoritarian than a simple tax.

The Eurozone, nor the EU has no right to tax individual countries, so yes, it goes against laws, and freedom. It is up to the individual nations to tax their citizens. If you are going to take away that freedom you have to renegotiate *everything* . Whether you want a federal Eurozone/EU or not, it will not happen easily, and certainly not in a few years. So no, it is not a solution. 

&gt;The Eurozone forbids defaulting and nationalizations so they'll have to leave anyway.

True. I think one of the problems is that as it stands now, one has to leave the EU. I am sure that can be worked around though. 

&gt;True, I'm not really interested in saving the Euro and the Euro has only made the crisis worse by enabling the differences between the North and the South to grow even larger. But the EU is the only entity that could enact the above mentioned reforms on a large scale.

I honestly don't know what reforms you are referring to? And, before you were talking about that southern Europe needed to borrow and invest money, but you never mentioned who is going to lend them the money and how they are going to afford it.  Could you please elaborate on that, since that was partly my original question? Where are they going to get the money from?

I'd also like to point out that the EU and the Eurozone are two different things (I mean, you know that, but you are saying that the EU is the only thing that can change things). To write a new treaty etc, is going to take years, and it is certainly not the political climate to do so now. So, it is not realistic that the EU will do anything in at least a decade. 

I don't think the Euro will last in its current form either. No matter which road they take, people will suffer. That is the shitty thing.

But something like this would truly be the ""stealing"" of land. Just imagine if Texas had a majority Mexican population, and Texas seceded only to be joined with Mexico -- same thing. But the thing I fear most is the aftermath. The latter more than anything as I'm sure that practically the entire Serbian male population will rise to arms if this ever happened. Not enough time has passed. This shit is still raw in the hearts and minds of Serbia's citizens. And I think a small part always will be -- I mean, we even have national holidays that everyone celebrates that have a strong basis in Kosovo.

My opinion of this? I hate the situation and wish we weren't in this mess. History has recorded that Kosovo has been Serbian before Albania was even a country and we should be content with that; a lot of our identity was forged in Kosovo, and our medieval monasteries and churches are still sprinkled across the province and it crushes my soul whenever I hear about Albanians destroying them, and I'm not even religious or anything. All of this is recorded and can never be forgotten, so again, the Serbian population should be content with that. But, with a heavy heart I have to admit that I would be blind if I think things will return to the way they were before. 

The only solution, in my opinion? King Solomon-style, baby. Separate the north region, and let it reunite back with the country it belongs with. Neither side will be satisfied, but in situations like this it's pretty much the only way to get *a solution*. The majority of the population in the north is Serbian, and that should be reason enough since that was all the reason the Albanian majority needed when they wanted to separate. The precedent has already been set, Mr. Thaci. As the past few years have shown, you cannot control the north, just like Serbia couldn't control Kosovo for the last two decades. Let it go. Besides, refusing this solution only adds more fuel to the conspiracy theories involving the US, and how the north region is the most rich in natural resources.

If you're asking for baked beans and bacon you're probably from the UK.

The usual [spanish bacon](http://s3.amazonaws.com/mumumio-production/medias/13893/medium.jpeg?1328787664) is not the same as [british bacon](http://www.thepauperedchef.com/images/2010/04/homemade-british_bacon_4.jpg) . 

Maybe is more similar to [lomo adobado](http://www.ibericoscanpipork.es/files/img_products/bandeja_lomo_adobado.jpg).

Go to a big supermarket first (maybe carrefour or something like that) and look for the pre-cut meat section, looking for lomo adobado or lomo ibérico adobado (this is going to be more expensive) and try that to see.

**sausages**

Do the same but looking for ""salchicha blanca fresca"". Not the same but maybe something similar.

**duvet**

Here, a duvet, is called ""edredón nórdico"" or just ""nórdico"", that means something like ""nordic cover"". Look @ Corte Inglés (not cheap), an especialized store like Nor Edredon (a bit far), or IKEA (very far away, but cheaper).

**baked beans**

In your regular/big supermarket, on the canned food or sauces section, you'll find sometimes Heinz Baked Beans.

Anyway...
Try a spanish breakfast and be fast buying the duvet! In december to january we'll hit minus-zero temps ;)",0,1349199007,null,0,false,0,c6gjnpj,t3_10t8tm,t1_c6gjnpj,t3_10t8tm,null,1430045184,1,false,Madrid,t5_2si9y,1

&gt;Je dis un leader fort pour l'exécutif (pour le législatif aussi d'ailleurs)

Est ce que ça veut dire que tu briserais la séparation du pouvoir exécutif et législatif ?

&gt;on ferait un bilan de son travail à la fin de sa mandature en le comparant avec ses promesses électorales.

Qui ferait ce bilan et comment s'assurer que le bilan soit objectif? Notamment, comment prendre en compte les changements de conjonctures (telle promesse peut être pertinente quand elle est faite mais ne plus l’être 7 ou 10 ans après)?

&gt;Je pense qu'il faudrait un ""examen"" concernant les institutions et les programmes politiques pour déterminer qui peut voter et qui ne peut pas. [...]Si les gens sont éduqués politiquement et économiquement, sans abrutissement et idéologie, alors je serais absolument d'accord

Mais justement, comment s'assurer 1) que les gens on une réel compréhension du sujet et n'ont pas ""appris pour le test"" 2) que le test n'est pas biaisé idéologiquement et 3) que pas seulement la partie la plus aisée de la population ait les moyens de se préparer pour le test, notamment si il est très difficile. de plus qui déciderait du contenu et de la difficulté des test? et est ce qu'il suffirait de les passer une fois ou ils faudrait les repasser a chaque élections ? 

Personnellement, il me semble que plus une personne a l'occasion de voter, notamment sur des sujets précis (comme pour des referendum) ou local (au niveau de la ville ou de la région), plus elle se forme et s’intéresse au enjeu politique. C'est au contraire le fait d'avoir de rare et grande élection ou tout est mélangé (capacité du dirigeant, équipe possible derrière lui, orientation politique, économique, diplomatique et social ) qui tend a découragé et désintéressé les gens de la politique et à offusqué des débats.",0,1349199605,null,0,false,0,c6gju3w,t3_10nsic,t1_c6gju3w,t1_c6fwxuv,null,1430045269,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1
