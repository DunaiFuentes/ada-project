As long as you can blend in a bit, look like you belong/know where you're going, and watch your stuff, you'll be fine.

I love the city itself and the people were generally very nice and helpful, especially for city people. The Metro is cheap, incredibly reliable, open really late, and easy to travel so you will not have any transportation worries. The buses are reliable too but a little confusing to figure out, so I stuck to the Metro and cabs when I had to. There is delicious food EVERYWHERE and amazing drink prices, at least in the summer (I'm talking almost a liter of beer for €1.50 at some places). And of course, Madrid is the capital city, so you're never short on things to do and see. The energy is non-stop. Aww, you made me all nostalgic.

 I would say go for it, practice your Spanish and enjoy the city. I would advise you to brush up on your Spanish before you go, because most people do not speak English or speak about as much English as you do Spanish.

Another American mentioned guns, which is *sort of* true but it depends on where you're at and they're certainly not ubiquitous like the other examples given and I think that's more what you're looking for here--I definitely wouldn't take for granted that any random American I meet owns a gun or is familiar with them (and I'm from Texas and own several guns, by the way, haha).

The driver's license one is much better I think because that's not only a truly ubiquitous assumption that almost any native born American would make about any other American old enough to drive (16 pretty much everywhere, though it does vary a bit) but also because it really differentiates us from most other countries, Europe in particular where the general assumption in a lot of places is just the opposite: odds are the person you're talking to *doesn't* have a driver's license.  This is especially true in places like Germany and Finland where getting a driver's license is a difficult and costly ordeal that takes over a year and consumes a good deal of your time (training, multiple tests, paperwork, etc.).

I would guesstimate that if you were to come to the U.S., there is over a 90% chance that any person you meet who's at least 16 has a driver's license, the only possible exception to this might be New York City and maybe Boston where it might drop down to something like 60-80% or so, but still a definite majority.

Oh, and no one knows how to drive a manual--it's an odd combination, I know: everyone has a license and knows how to drive (an automatic) but no one knows how to drive a manual.

true,redlightsaber,ESPA,Spain,"I disagree. I think her reasoning is the perfect balance between a truly free market and customer protection. I, like her, also have no problem whatsoever with ISPs offering limited internet packages as long as they're clearly advertised as such, and as long as the methods they use to ""limit"" that internet doesn't invade on my privacy (like DPI does).

Forcing every ISP to give ""full internet"" would be akin to forcing cable companies to offer every possible channel there is, in all their packages. That makes no sense, and people should be able to pay less for things that are adequate to their needs. I don't need, for instance, full-blown internet on my phone, as I never use more than, say, 500mb/month, and I certainly don't torrent on there. Why should I be forced to pay a full internet fee of something like €30/month, in some distorted notion of ""freedom""?

Again, as I said, as long as the option exists *somewhere* (and they're all correctly advertised), a true free market can emerge where things can work themselves out and different packages for different price points can coexist.

Addressing your last point: I don't think that's true. ISPs in my country that offer true full internet (and market it as such) aren't really any more expensive than shadier packages by other companies. The real-world price for actual bandwith isn't high at all or one that would require them to raise the prices in an honestly-advertised system. Of course some companies are bound to do so (as they do for all perceived ""premium"" services), but, again, as long as the free market is allowed to remain free (with measures like what this woman proposes, effectively dissolving the oligarquies), they'll be left at a disadvantage by other companies who can offer it at the prices that it's really possible to do so.

Another possible criticism for this set is the choice of comparing (European) areas of high population density and high agricultural productivity to, mostly, deserts...

Finally, the comparison between cities would have been more useful if the populations had been indicated (and, ideally, similar.) In general, European cities have a much higher density than Asian or American cities which tend to be subject to more urban sprawl.

Und es gibt solche und solche? Es gibt wissenschaftliche Methoden. An dese muss sich gehalten werden. Diese Methoden werden aber leider nicht immer eingehalten. Manchmal ist es sogar noch schwieriger, weil dasselbe Experiment total unterschiedliche Ergebnisse bringt. Weil es meistens einen Parameter gibt, den man übersehen hat, oder weil die Tests nicht völlig durchdacht waren.

Wiedemauchsei, ein Beipiel aus der Quantenmechanik, wieso man die Existenz Gottes nicht ausschließen kann bzw nicht darf: Schrödingers Katze. Ich kann behaupten, dass die Katze tot ist. Ich kann behaupten, dass die Katze lebt. Solange ich nicht nachsehe, weiß ich es nicht. Wer ist in der Beweispflicht? Beide. Weil beide eine Theorie haben. Ein dritter könnte sagen, dass die Katze ein Untoter ist, ein vierter, dass die Katze zu einer Gottheit auf Reddit mutierte. Nun, keiner kann es beweisen, außer er schaut unter den Deckel.

Ist sie tot? Dann hat Kandidat 1 recht.

Ist sie am Leben? Dann hat Kandidat 2 recht.

Ist sie Untot? Dann hat Kandidat 3 recht.

Ist sie zur Gottheit geworden? Woher willst du das wissen? Vielleicht ist ihre göttliche Fähigkeit tot/untot zu sein? Aber ein Gott muss doch leben? Also egal, welches Ergebnis du hast, du kannst es imemr so interpretieren, dass sie zur Gottheit wurde, nur eben ihre Fähigkeiten nicht zeigt oder genau dadurch zeigt, etc. Sprich: egal welches Ergebnis, Kandidat 4 hat immer recht.

Ist sie kein Gott? Kann ich dieselbe Logik wie oben verwenden und erhalte immer das ergebniss, dass es eine normale Katze ist. Außer sie zeigt wirklich übersinnliche Fähigkeiten.

Und Beweiszwang hat übrigens nicht der, der eine Behauptung aufstellt, sondern der, der die Behauptung nicht glaubt bzw. ihr widerspricht (wie gesagt, man kann nur falsifizieren).

* Environmental concerns, that are quite legitimate. But ""buy EU products"" or even ""buy Italian products"" doesn't solve that.

That is nonsense. ""Full Internet"" is nothing else but Internet that has *not* been tampered with, and where your privacy has *not* been violated by DPI equipment. Given that you properly invest in your infrastructure and not prefer a ""managing the scarcity"" business model that allows you to bully customers and content providers around, it is *cheaper* to offer ""full Internet"".

&gt;I don't need, for instance, full-blown internet on my phone, as I never use more than, say, 500mb/month, and I certainly don't torrent on there.

Volume caps have little to do with net neutrality.

&gt;Addressing your last point: I don't think that's true. ISPs in my country that offer true full internet (and market it as such) aren't really any more expensive than shadier packages by other companies. The real-world price for actual bandwith isn't high at all or one that would require them to raise the prices in an honestly-advertised system.

You don't adequately consider future development. The transition from real Internet to broken Internet is a switch in business models that completely changes the market.

In order to buy food and other necessities people will start trading the IOUs at a big discount for Euros.

At this point Greece will have in effect 2 currencies. A few months later it will become abundantly clear to most Greeks that the IOUs cannot and will not ever be paid back. Then the Government will institute the brand new Drachma.

If True Finns continue to increase their influence, in case of a true federal jump, Finland might decide to keep its AAA for itself and simply leave.

Well sure, Denmark is in the ESM II I think so its currency cannot drift too far from the euro. There are talks of a new referendum from time to time but support for the euro has been in free fall lately and Denmark also has opt-outs from several other part of the Maastricht and subsequent treaties.

&gt; And if we speak about Nordic free trade area, that simply just won't work because Nordic economies are highly integrated with both the global and central European economy.

I disagree, it would simply be a reversal to the [EFTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association). Remember, we're talking in the context of a true european federation. So you'd have a very integrated European Union and some countries leaving the EU for the EFTA with the European Economic Area still allowing free trade between the two. But members of the EFTA would not be linked politically to a federal EU.

Personally I would be fine with such a scenario.

As for the Balts, I agree they would probably rather join a more integrated union but I was actually including them in ""some eastern european countries"" rather than in nordic countries.

True Finns are history, their support has already declined and if and when they loose big time in the next municipal elections, the party has lost its edge and won't ever return to its peak. Another thing eating their support that other parties have moved to cover their central ground, be it immigration or social policies.

In case of Finland and our AAA-rating, that rating has as much to do with being in the Euro as it has with our industrial base. If we still would have had our own currency we would have been hit by speculative attacks and that would have taken our AAA-rating. Also how would you propose giving up the Euro, it is impossible to abandon usage of Euro without having our economy collapse.

&gt; I disagree, it would simply be a reversal to the EFTA. Remember, we're talking in the context of a true european federation. So you'd have a very integrated European Union and some countries leaving the EU for the EFTA with the European Economic Area still allowing free trade between the two. But members of the EFTA would not be linked politically to a federal EU.

The problem of EFTA was that it didn't have large enough stick to carry around. The EU has a big stick and it can always threaten any other country or a trade block with a trade war, this essentially shield member states from external pressure. For example just few years ago the US sent the Finnish state a nasty letter that urged us to change our generic medicine legislation, thanks to being in the EU, our government had the ability to put the letter straight into garbage bin. The same is also true with both Russia and China - if you don't have big stick with you, you will be railed under.

&gt; Personally I would be fine with such a scenario. It's one thing for states not to want deeper integration but northern countries (also including the UK) sometimes even block other countries from deeper integration. With a clear split between a federal EU and a renewed EFTA, I think everybody would be pleased and nobody would feel left out.

That is nice and all, but at the end of the line, you either are with us or you are against us. Federal Europe would have much bigger stick than renewed EFTA and in time there would repercussions to that fact.

Personally I believe that after the current economic crisis is over the EU Commission should start just sacking up sanctions to countries that haven't joined the Euro and aren't seen making progress to join it as their EU accession treaties require them to do.

&gt;The Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz, says: ""the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there."" Stiglitz explains his position: Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, is often cited as arguing for the ""invisible hand"" and free markets: firms, in the pursuit of profits, are led, as if by an invisible hand, to do what is best for the world. But unlike his followers, Adam Smith was aware of some of the limitations of free markets, and research since then has further clarified why free markets, by themselves, often do not lead to what is best. (...) *Whenever there are ""externalities""—where the actions of an individual have impacts on others for which they do not pay, or for which they are not compensated—markets will not work well.* Some of the important instances have long understood environmental externalities. Markets, by themselves, produce too much pollution. Markets, by themselves, also produce too little basic research.

If you want to stay out of the touristy things, then the first thing you want to do is get out of Munich. It's full of tourists (but of course, basically most of the major cities in Germany are full of tourists) Many of them English speaking. So after a day or two there you should, in my opinion, head north.

Honestly I'm a huge booster for the former East Germany. Way more interesting, way less touristy, way cheaper. The natural beauty of Thüringen (Thuringia) is far superior to the Black Forest or Franconia (which people go on about *ad nauseum* without justification). Erfurt is fantastic, as are the smaller cities around, Weimar, Gotha, Eisenach and Jena. The Thüringer Wald (Thuringian Forest) around there provide ample places for hiking.

Leipzig is a serially underrated place, as is the nearby Halle.

To the east is Dresden a popular city, worthy of a day or more. What is particularly great near there is the Sächsische Schweiz (Saxon Switzerland), which abuts the easily accessible Bohemian Switzerland across the border.

Berlin, I would argue, is a necessity. Yes, it's the busiest tourist destination in the country, but it has, by far, the best cultural opportunities in the country. Also, the disparate nature of the city means it never feels as busy as, for example, the Munich Altstadt. There are many opportunities to escape the busy areas and explore other parts of the city.

And if you really want to go far I would recommend the Baltic coast in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Hardly any non-German tourist. Plenty of opportunities. Rügen is beautiful and has many places to hike, etc. Ex. around Sassnitz.

Look at it from another way, if someone leaves, then they clearly weren't committed enough and would probably be more of a burden and less of a benefit.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;I've pondered about a union of regions, where instead of having a more integrated EU, we focus on regional integration (such as Scandinavia, Iberia and other regions starting political integration).

I fully agree, I also think about this quite often, how to balance Europe from within without hurting the interests of some groups by bundling too different countries. Countries like Malta shouldn't have such influence in the whole scheme of things but they also shouldn't be just tied to the Italians, do you understand what I'm trying to say?

&gt;My mum is Dutch and my father Swedish, although I was living in Madrid until a few weeks ago. My secondary school was an international British school, and as such I can't fully identify with any one nationality. This in turns I'm quite comfortable with pan-european ideas.

You don't need any of that to be a strong European supporter.:P

I'm born and raised in Portugal and only started learning English when I was 10, in the 5th grade. Also, my parents were both born in Africa, my mother in Angola and my father in Congo.

true,AshaVahishta,null,null,"Well, you did indicate you'd rather buy from Portugal and Spain than the US and Israel, which is rather weak in terms of environmental awareness. I didn't mean to attack you in particular but rather the ""buy local"" crowd as a whole whose naïve pavlovian behavior ignores the complex reality of the issues in question.

Who are they to say that workers from X are more entitled to their jobs than workers in Y? This opinion that some people are worth more than others (which is what all nationalistic opinion is at its core, whether it's ""buy American cheese"" or the public's willful ignorance of the suffering caused by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan) is disgustingly selfish and revealing.

Those ""slave laborers"" in China surely need their jobs a whole lot more than the average European, who probably wouldn't even think about doing their job, even if the conditions and pay were up to ""European standards"". So Europeans losing their jobs to China is overall a positive change; one (or usually several) Chinese job contributes more to the betterment of humanity than one European job.

You may recall that I phrased it ""a well-functioning global market"". This of course implies that practices such as dumping that works against the functioning of the market can be dealt with, whether it's by the WTO or anti-dumping tariffs. Consumers are also free to make an informed decision and not buy products made with child labor, from conflict zones, etc. I even support government interference to block these products from entering a market when there's sufficient evidence.

TL;DR: Making informed decisions when purchasing a product because of environmental or ethical concerns is fine. Buying European to support European workers or the European economy is selfish and detrimental to humanity as a whole.

(You could argue that by supporting China economically you implicitly support the Chinese government and military, whose intentions may be less pure than those of Western governments, thus supporting the spread of ideologies and actions that result in a total negative effect, but that's a whole nother topic)",0,1338584659,null,0,false,0,c4v3p84,t3_uffel,t1_c4v3p84,t1_c4ux10w,null,1429048013,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;I'd be more up for something like that than the current massive cultural 'melting pot'.

I'm still fully for the open borders and the possibility to live and work wherever within the Union but trying to bundle all these different cultures together would be just insanely impossible.

Besides, what's important is the cooperation between us Europeans and a single voice to the outside world. Not someone from wherever telling Iberians, Italians and Irish that they should all do the same, as that clearly would not work, these countries have different problems and different ways to tackle them. ;)

Basically, though further integration isn't a bad thing, centralized government isn't required outside of areas such as foreign relations or security. There needs to be a balance, Greece and Portugal should have the same public debt standards as Germany and Denmark but nobody is willing to give up their full sovereignty (for example, Portuguese drug laws or maximum sentences are fine the way they are, we don't want them changed by anyone, specially if they come from the outside!).

&gt;look at Greece and Germany. So much friction. Not just the politics, but people's attitudes and opinions.

Greece unfortunately looks like a very special case. One where government incompetence plunged the country into massive debt and now they're victimizing themselves. Not that they're fully to blame, stricter regulation to Greek public finance would have discover these issues prematurely but unfortunately now there's that and the Greeks don't seem to be too pleased about the Union's response..

I honestly don't think Germany is to blame, they're in fact doing a lot to keep us together, though I'm also fully aware Greece is having a hard time and we can't just demand them paying up everything, though it must be clear that careless spending of other people's money just isn't something allowed.

&gt;It was only 60 years ago there was war here, and the Wall only fell 30 years ago. That's not very long really.

Now with the internet, with companies working all over Europe and with the easiness one crosses a border, we're pretty much on the same page regarding everything. And 60 years a long time ago. I can't say we're growing too fast, perhaps what we are is not being cautious enough. :)

I was born almost 19 years ago, Portugal has been in the EU for 26 years, it's not a long time ago, sure, but still, I consider myself a Portuguese and an European at the same time. I mean, there's the language barrier where we both had to learn English to communicate with each other, but once you past that, are we really that different? I mean, I'm pretty sure my lack of blond hair, my lack of light skin tone or my difficulties in coping with very cold temperatures would make it difficult for me to pass for a Scandinavian, but if you consider only ideological and political issues, are we really that different?

If you convince people to buy a ""Made in the EU"" product because it's made in the EU the label now has value and thus two products that are exactly the same and are priced identically (ex. the fruit from Spain/Israel) have different subjective values for the customer.

A customers subjective value of an item is exceptionally important because it determines what he/she is willing to pay. It may seem stupid. From an objective point of view it is stupid but that's how it works. 

If you have a good brand you will make fantastic margins, and by making fantastic margins you can afford to employ more people and thus not only save jobs but make new ones.

While this way of doing business is horribly inefficient and feels slightly exploitative (think 500$ HDMI cables, same principle) it is surprisingly sustainable and sometimes beneficial.

true,MeteorPhoenix,PUER,Puerto Rico,"&gt; I should have explained Portugal's system better. We have legislative elections. We vote for the political party we want to be represented in the Parliament. Each political party has a leader. The leader of the political party with the most votes becomes the PM. This is to say that in Portugal the person that becomes PM is tightly related to the Parliament, policywise. A party with a teddy bear for a leader wouldn't get much votes, therefore wouldn't be represented in parliament let alone have its teddy bear leader as PM.

You misunderstand me. What I meant to say is that saying a PM is an unelected puppet is silly. The PM cannot force legislation through and relies on the votes of the MPs. The MPs are directly elected, and if they fuck up, they get fired. What is it exactly about the Greek and Italian example that so contradicted representative democracy?

&gt; This is to say, I'm decrying the fact that there are countries in Europe whose Constitution and electoral law are still too far removed from democracy for the supposed beacon of democracy and equality Europe pretends to be. I'm decrying these parliamentary systems where people don't know what PM they're giong to get when they go out and vote for their representatives. It all reeks of aristocracy disguised as democracy with crumbs of petty voting participation.

You're making a hell of a jump and I have no idea where you're getting it. Again, say a Parliament has 500 members. If 251 vote for something, it passes. All of those 251 members were elected. Why are you putting this much emphasis on how the PM got there (temporarily, at that)? 

In Greece, Pasok and New Democracy voted for austerity. Pasok and New Democracy were elected by the people. Papademos was heading a technocratic government, but where are you getting the un-democratic bit? Every law, every motion, every action was passed through by *elected officials*.

Did it hurt you to hear what the foreigners were saying about the Greek people?


""I think that all those insults we've had have hurt not only me but the vast majority of the Greeks because it is unfair to blame the Greeks when they know that [according to the international statistics] they work more than the European average, much more than the Germans, more than the rest of the European people.

However, they are called lazy, they are called drones and I think this is neither the fault of Ms [Christine] Lagarde nor Ms Merkel. This is the fault of the Greek leaders. Those who were used to attending meetings with the Europeans where they themselves defamed the Greek people. The first to talk about corrupt Greeks was Mr. [George] Papandreou, it wasn't Ms Lagarde. And as Mr. [Evangelos] Venizelos has said, they were used to attending meetings and telling the others what they were ready to hear — not what the Greek people wanted to say, not defending what's just.

And then they (the leaders) would come back to Greece and convey blackmails and threats. The threat for a Greek exit from the euro was not first stated by Ms Merkel but by Mr Papandreou, Mr Venizelos, Mr [Lucas] Papademos, Mr [Antonis] Samaras. Can you recall in the times before the memorandum when a Greek exit was an issue? Who created it?

Every policy they come up with, the party backs it up (unless Merkel &amp; the Gang start nodding in disapprovement, which is why Ministers in Greece pressured the former Greek PM to leave last here). Coallition governments even get such blind support from more than one party. All this in order to secure a majority support of the government. This is true for any political system.

Ok, but that's a different problem altogether. This isn't about a PM and his cabinet being technocratic; you're criticizing the democratically-elected officials. Which is legitimate and everything, but not grounds to call a system undemocratic, especially if those officials in question lose power in the elections.

&gt; I'm talking about a subtle difference of principle. In Portugal when you vote you know the whole package you're getting. In Greece or italy you don't. That for me is the difference between a transparent election and an aristocratic one, which is to say the former is more democratic than the latter.

You know Italy (I don't know about Greece) has a history with technocratic governments, right? It's not seen as a terrible thing for experts to temporarily take over if the country's in the shitter (which, with Berlusconi, it was). I don't know much about how much support Papademos got, but Monti's fairly popular.

The point of this kind of government is to get the country out of a crisis, and them immediately turn over power to people elected in new elections.

&gt; I think our opinions differ due to different life experiences. In the end, the majority of people don't care about the cards their Consitution handles them, and vote irresponsibly no matter how good those are. The result is thus the same, but the principle still stands.

Then there are ladies that don't actively try to get a lot of attention for themselves who end up being much prettier when the makeup comes off, and look 5 times better if they actually tried to dress up nice.

There are people who are like ""but my partner has to always look good (like a model)"" --&gt; they need to grow up, nobody ""always looks good"" :P

Surely there must be some more guys out there that are not fooled by makeup. One of my ex-gfs was quite good looking, she was from Poland (not that it had anything to do with it), and she insisted to wear makeup even when she went to bed in order to look good. I'm not sure if she ever knew, because I sure as hell never told her, but she looked like a monster in the morning because of how the makeup moved around and stuff while sleeping hehehe.

The example of your friend who has very low standards is a very good example.. sometimes people honestly don't know what they really want or what is good for them, and the things that attract them are bad for them :)

Suppose someone is into nice legs and there are 2 ladies in the bar (for argument sake).. one of them is wearing some kind of tights/fishnet combo or some crap with a skirt and the other one is wearing jeans. The average guy is gonna look at the fishnet girl first simply because she attracts more attention, but the one wearing the jeans could very well have the best legs in the northern hemisphere.

Ninja Clarification: After a few years, I eventually told my ex-gf that she didn't have to wear makeup at night and she was like ""omfg, but..."", and I was like ""don't worry about it""..

You will need a proficiency certificate to take many of the courses at FU. It depends on the course that you wish to take, but if you can obtain a C1 level certificate you should be able to take whatever classes you want. Regardless you need to take placement test to know where you stand. 

&gt; It's in Dahlem, which Wikipedia says is relatively wealthy.

The Dahlem-Dorf is one of the more affluent areas of the city but you should also remember that this is Germany and you do not need to live in the direct vicinity to get to class every day. You can find housing relatively inexpensive in Berlin. It is by and large one of the most, if not the most, affordable major capital in Europe. I homestayed while there but I met people there who payed under 500 Euros a month in rent. **IF** you know how to live lean you can survive on about 30 Euros a week, provided you don'd want to go out. 

I don't know if you are from the states or elsewhere, but FU generally loves American students and will go out of their way to accommodate them. I heard of one scholarship that covers monthly living expenses for American Graduate students and another great benefit, at least in the Transatlantic relations program, is that you can write your papers in native English while lectures are in German. (A great advantage for me). 

All this I have gleaned from my time abroad there in the FU-BEST program. Hopefully I will be able to return for graduate studies. That's all I can think of now. I apologize for any incoherence, I am a little tipsy. Viel Glueck und Viel Erfolg!

Exactly This is my main issue. For example, each country with economic issues right now got into this mess by different means and the same solution isn't going to work for everyone. I probably shouldn't say this here, but that's also why I'm against this fiscal pact. I'd rather see 'thinktanks' or something really trying to figure out the solution that's best on an individual level, and then of course, find out how to bring those solutions together in an integrated manner before anyone goes around signing anything. It would be an incredibly difficult undertaking... but, how could it not be worth it? Is there not enough at stake yet? How bad does it have to get?

&gt;I'm pretty sure my lack of blond hair, my lack of light skin tone or my difficulties in coping with very cold temperatures would make it difficult for me to pass for a Scandinavian, but if you consider only ideological and political issues, are we really that different?

We have our similarities of course, and the larger picture you look at, the more they stand out against the rest of the world. But, there are pretty big differences too. I've worked with people from all over Europe, and would take a totally different approach to doing business with a Spaniard than a Dane. 

But, the point of my fantasy union, is to not have such large cultural barriers to tackle and to allow for more individuality among regions. Then let us come together and do what we are really good at. I've happened to have worked quite a bit with both Germans and Greeks, and love them both for different reasons.

It doesn't make any sense.

Also it would mean that those of us outside of Spain or Portugal would suddenly find that some of our €50 notes were worth less than €50 (or 100 Marks, for example, if we're assuming that everyone abandons the currency at once and goes back to what it was before).

what is nationalism?  i think it has a meaning only in context.  the context is different if you're in the time and place of De Gaulle.  

what can be said is that the French have steered a bit of a third-way these past 60 years and done very well with it.  Their model is successful - that is I think the root of most disdain from outsiders.  According to our belief systems and ""science"" it simply should not be, yet there they are, doing as well as us and often better!  

Find me an article in a French paper as ornery as this, implying essentially that the French should have a say in the way England is governed because so many of them live in France.  (exclusions are made here for former colony's haha, but that's the old guard and the real French mostly hate them too see Sarkozy ass whooping in recent election).  

western Europe is quite the qualifier!  How many countries ARE there in that description?  Not so many, and more than half are basically not allowed to be too nationalistic considering their complete and utter FAILS of very recent history.  The rest are too small or unstable to beat their chests too proudly.   And the UK is no slouch when it comes to asserting its superior way of life...

Bringing up Napoleon?  That was hundreds of years ago, and it's not like he had any choice.  I do recall the monarchs of the continent repeatedly ganging up on them.  It was an ideological fight and he kicked their ass.  Eventually they got him - deal with it.

Well obviously this is a humour piece, so I'm sure there are humorous articles in French papers.

&gt;Bringing up Napoleon? That was hundreds of years ago, and it's not like he had any choice.

Sure. But I was using the example of De Gaulle writing a history on Napoleon without including any mention of Wellington (against whom he never won) as an example of the French nationalist psyche. France is one of those countries that if they have something to be proud of historically, they will hammer it to death.

Plus sérieusement, je ne dis pas que Hollande est ""méchant"". Je dis juste que cette circulaire était l'arbre qui cachait la forêt. J'ai appris son existence lorsqu'une amie, faisant partie de l'élite des diplômés du pays (grande école extrêmement reconnue), m'en avait parlé avec crainte. 
Après m'être renseigné sur cette circulaire, j'avais vu qu'elle modifiait uniquement à la marge un dispositif existant déjà, et qu'elle touchait d'un coup une toute petite élite qui n'avait jamais levé le petit doigt pour les autres immigrés (discriminés, ceux-là). J'avais alors tenté de rassuré l'amie en question en lui expliquant qu'il suffisait qu'il y ait une réaction, puis une solidarité de classe, pour que cette circulaire soit abrogée. On ne renvoie pas des gens faisant les mêmes grandes écoles que nos dirigeants dans leurs pays. Cela ne se fait pas. Ce n'est pas très poli, déjà, et surtout : ces études coûtent réellement une fortune. 

Peu de temps après, les tribunes, articles et manifestations ont commencé à se produire. Ce qui est drôle, c'est qu'il y avait autant de gens dans ces manifs qu'au sein de squats violemment expulsés dont tout le monde se fout généralement (les pauvres attirent moins l'attention que les riches). Pourtant, ils avaient toute l'attention des médias. Ben oui : dans ces manifs, certains portaient même des éléments distinctifs de leurs écoles. C'était une manif d'aristocrates mondialisés plus qu'une lutte de pauvres immigrés à qui l'on refuse tout statut en France. 

Je ne dis pas que la circulaire Guéant était une bonne chose. Elle était absurde. Et s'il y avait un tel consensus pour l'abroger, c'est parce qu'elle gênait (quasiment) tout le monde. 
Mais il ne faut pas oublier que sa suppression ne fait que revenir sur un détail, vraiment ridicule, du système français de contrôle de l'immigration.

Oui, il s'agit d'une action purement cynique (mais positive) et démagogique. Les quelques dizaines ou centaines d'immigrés en question faisaient pour la plupart partie de la ""fuite des cerveaux"" de leurs pays d'origine plus que d'une immigration cherchant à trouver refuge en France. Ils sont plus proches, socialement, économiquement et culturellement plus proches de nos élites françaises que des pauvres de leurs pays.

Hollande n'a pas défendu les plus faibles. Il n'a fait que revenir sur une situation absurde pour des gens d'une classe sociale à qui on ne refuse généralement que peu de choses.

On est autant face à une focalisation de classe, dans les médias et pour les hommes politiques, que lorsqu'on arrête pas de nous rabâcher les oreilles avec la dernière grève d'une compagnie aérienne (dont les services sont fréquemment utilisés par une toute petite, toute petite, minorité de la population) ou même les problèmes des stations de ski (idem). 

Faut arrêter de croire que les problèmes des riches, des élites, ou des dominants sont les problèmes de tout le monde. Le fait que les grands-écoliers soient immigrés plutôt que nés en France ne change rien à la façon dont ils appartiendront à certains systèmes de domination plus tard. Je suis très heureux de savoir que le mec qui m'entubera dans le futur aura la double nationalité plutôt qu'il sera Français, mais en fait... heu... non, j'en ai rien à foutre. Cette circulaire était absurde, okay, et je voulais sa suppression afin que certains amis puissent rester en France, mais j'ai toujours trouvé à vomir la sur-focalisation des gens là-dessus. Pendant ce temps, les vrais problèmes de l'immigration (camps de rétention, reconduites violentes, squats avec expulsions pas très cordiales et très matraquées...) sont oubliés.",0,1338624930,null,0,false,0,c4vagy1,t3_udmil,t1_c4vagy1,t1_c4uvifl,null,1429051281,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

I'm quite sure the euroskeptics are gonna go wild about this, but Cyprus is only in this situation for giving money to Greece, not because they were borrowing and can't pay back. The only reason they are truly considering getting a bailout from Europe at all is because of the fear that Greece is gonna try to stick it to the EU on their bailout terms and end up having to leave the eurozone -- only Europe would be able to stop the cypriot economy from collapsing in such event because a lot of assets owned by Cypriot businesses in Greece will lose a lot of value.

Listen, the german government didn't decide to do that, the european union did. The austerity was also decided by the european union.

It just so happens that Germany is the financial knot in this whole story, but that doesn't mean they're responsible for it. Keep in mind that you, as a european citizen, have a right to write directly to the european council, and tell them that. It's what I would do -- if it'd do anything good, that is. They'll likely just ignore the letter.

&gt;When greece was destroyed by germany in WW2 and suffered at least 200 billion$ of damages . .

The german people suffered through WW2 just as much as your people. Please don't act as if we sat on a warm couch, while the rest of europe burned. 

&gt;they never once demanded germany pay them back. Greece has always tried to assist germany after WW2 in there journey to join Western Europe

True, but do you seriously believe germans simply disregarded it? Of course they *want* to help greece. It's not that we don't want to - the laws of the european union make it pretty goddamn difficult to help.


&gt;they see no such forgiveness or assistance from germany. All greeks see is merkel destroying 1 million jobs just so she can help her banker friends/masters.

Like I said, you have a guaranteed right to voice your opinion to the european council: http://www.european-council.europa.eu/contacts?lang=el

Merkel is, just like Hollande, merely representing the laws of the EU. And to work with those laws, they had to institutionate austerity. It sounds awful, but remember, this is what capitalism is all about. Money.

&gt;Many greeks feel that germany has fired the 1st ""bullet"" in an economic war, and the goal of this war is to turn greece into a germany colony

No. The german people wouldn't allow annexiation like that. Trust me on that one. They'd rather have Merkel whipped publicly before they'd allow that. Germans *want to help greece, they want greece to recover*. It's the european union, and their cocksucking sockpuppets that make it such a pain in the butt.

&gt;all greeks want is there dignity back and to not only get there economy back on track but to give something back to europe.

And it's understandable that you do. But considering the current state of the european union, the future is dark, for *all* european countries. Only a fool wouldn't be able to see that.

----

That being said, don't focus your hate on germans. The germans have nothing to do with the current state of the european union, nor greece. It's merkel, respectively her sockpuppet party, the CDU, who forces everyone into this state of misery. The german people want to help, the german government wants money, and doesn't give any fucks about humanity.

A little more south is Sitges, the beaches arent as big but there are more bars and activities on the beach. It is usually pretty crowded but has a really good atmosphere and the people there are pretty easy on the eyes. Something to note is that south of Barcelona the sand is very fine and north  (costa brava) it becomes very grainy. Barceloneta is about as dirty as it gets, I never saw a ""dirty"" beach in the years that I was there. 

As far as cheap clubs. Usually you can only get in for free if you get there by like 9, which is really early, as most places don't pick up until around 12. The clubs by the port olympic are free to get in, but not that nice. If you want to go to an actual club, it is worth it to pay the 10-20 cover and just stay until 4 or 5.

That said, it depends on how well the advertising campaign goes. We had a UK-wide referendum a while back that would replace the first-past-the-post form of vote counting with instant run-off. ""No"" won the vote, despite the fact that it's a more sensible system (which is in fact used for council elections in Scotland already), almost entirely because the Conservative Party sponsored a vast campaign of senationalist adverts.

They went as far to create billboards such as [this utter bullshit](http://paperbackrioter.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/avkillsbabies.jpg). Note that they have *no* basis for that £250 million claim, and this is actually from a party that already wants to destroy the NHS as it exists today. I was so outraged by these that I wrote to the Advertising Standards Agency and was told that in the context of election propaganda, anything goes: there are no legal ramifications to making up numbers and showcasing them all over the country.

David Cameron, our current Prime Minister and the leader of the Conservative Party, has made it clear that he will actively campaign against Scottish independence. He has actually said that outright, but I can't be bothered finding a source for the quote right now. That means we could see more shit like that: scare tactics with billboards all over Scotland telling us we'll go bankrupt and be ruined. As far as Cameron's concerned, he could put up a billboard saying ""independence will prevent any Englishman from entering your country"" and face no legal consequences, and it might still influence the vote.

I have never been awarded nor have I ever awarded an A- for a score of less than 90%.  This is unheard of unless a test or a class is graded on a curve (However, curves are used to reflect the fact that the course material is purposefully more difficult than the level of the student--a tactic often used to challenge students).

Now, it IS possible that it is easier to get a 90% in the US than in Germany.  The reason for this is unclear. Maybe it's due to grade inflation in the US.  Alternatively, maybe US professors make a better effort to teach their students.  Or, maybe the course material is easier in the US.  Or, maybe US students are just better students (although I personally doubt it).  Maybe it's a combination of factors.

Whatever the reason, it doesn't change the fact that a 89% is a B+ at virtually all US academic institutions.  Thus, the Wikipedia article is wrong.

Keep in mind that there are assholes in *every* country, including germany. Some germans take those anti german movements a little too personal (even though those movements should actually be towards the council), and thusly, will say all sort of offensive things. That's no different in greece, though. I'm sure you know what I mean. ;-)

&gt;Ofcourse like all governments currently, the german government does not do as the public wants . . they only follow what corrupt bankers tell them to do.

Unfortunately that's true. However, things may change if the PiratenPartei (pirate party of germany) gets their seats in the parliament. One can only hope that day will come soon...

&gt;Its not surprising that banks have so much power in our world today, if you read up about early 20th century american politics you will see how extremely powerful bankers and businessmen basically took over the US government. I think the same has happened to EUrope with the EUro currency. Now the bankers make the rules and there pitbulls such as Merkel only do as they are told.

That's also very true. I'd recommend you this short movie '[The American Dream](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGk5ioEXlIM)', which is about the corruption of banks in the USA.

We have to reserve the word for grand scale systematic killing based on ethnicity. I don't think Sebrenica was a part of a wider plan of exterminating the Bosniaks, it was the massacre of a city, which sadly has been done as long as people have been warring.

Would they also not kill the women if it was a grand genocidal plan? They wanted to weaken the Bosnianks militarly.

If NATO had not intervened, it may very well have become a genocide, who knows. But let us be very precise about how we use words. By using the word genocide we imply that Serbs had a grand plan, when it very well could just have been the mad decision of a field commander. I don't think we have the proof the back the former, and thus using such words will only alienate the Serbs from the European community, which would hinder the progress of integrating that region into the EU.

I am sure this guy is an asshole, but that is beside the point. As long as this president does not deny that it was the biggest war crime and atrocity in Europe since WW2, I have no problem withhim saying this.

There is a difference. Turke has a law against insulting Turkishness(tm)(r)(c), stupid I know, so anyone could take anyone to court on those charges. 

Cleary the person taking this to court, is a religious nut (civilian or offical) that uses this Law as a proxy to silence him. Turkey is part Islam =&gt; you insult Turkey =&gt; offence. But how will the judicical system do with the case, that is the important question.

I oppose multiculturalism because I think its natural that a population moves towards a monoculture. Just look at the US, hundreds of cultures mixing together, but it only takes two generations before immigrants are integrated into American culture.

Therefore I think every policy that promotes multiculturalism is a waste, and it also slows integration of immigrants into their new society.

It's not because my culture is better, its just that immigrants culture has no possibility to survive for anything more than a couple of generations in this new country.

For the same reason I am not a nationalist in any sense and a EU-federalist, because I know that sooner or later, European culture will converge into a common European culture. I see the current nation states as a poor multicultural policy which will not survive in the future of Europe.

but get to student parties! Carpe Noctem near the Main-Bus-Station is really cheap and good on Monday or Tuesday, many studets meet there.
at friday or saturday you can go to the Tiefenrausch at the Bertha-Von-Suttner Platz, its bigger than Carpe Noctem with really good parties , cheap drinks and cool music.

Again I must point out that not everybody should be able to study law, 15% of the 50% of a year that attend a Gymnasium seems a fair share. Especially in Germany, a nation with a lot of laws and the most lawsuits per person in the entire world. Its not like being a lawyer in Germany is as easy as in some other places.  

Also by far not enough people take advantage of the opportunites offered to them, that make getting into certain programs much easier. Like doing Internships, apprenticeships, FPJ/FÖJ/FSJs, Working in foreign countries or relieve programs for a year, or even military service.

The problem with eurobonds are not really Germany, Findland, Netherland and the rest, but in reality its population. The politicians and most industrialists want eurobonds. The population are the ones who is going to be punished by them, so politicians have been and are manouvering to sell them as a good thing for the general population.

In reality the eurobonds are already happening. For example, the EFSF is a step into eurobonds and it has been a reality for a while. You can consider the EFSF a eurobond with limited functionality. The EFSF shifts fiscal responsability from a specific country towards all the countries of the EU, just like a eurobond, with the dfiference that, by law, the EFSF can not be used to finance anything a EU burocrat wants, but its limited in functionality. Then you have the ESM, that its definitive as opposed to the EFSF which was supposed to be temporary. While the ESM is still somehow limited and therefore not a full eurobond, it has less limitations than the EFSF.

The eurobonds are coming, but since the population is wary of them because of the effects they will have they are using the political tactic of going slowly so there will be no uproar (so they hope and I believe they will get away with it). I think anyone should assume the eurobonds are coming (short of some popular big protest/revolution) and that means the EU will have full fiscal power.
