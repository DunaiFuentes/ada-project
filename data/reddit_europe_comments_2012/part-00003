- grant citizenship to all those legally residing in the country at the time of independence being declared (I believe this was the case in Lithuania, for example?)

- grant citizenship to all those born in the territory of the newly independent country (is this what Slovenia did? I do remember some trouble with residents from other Yugo republics who did not get passports from either Slovenia or their 'home' republics and ended up stateless)

- grant citizenship to only those born in the country and the offspring of those born in the country at the previous time of independence (i.e. the notorious examples of Latvia and Estonia, whose use of this logic might have been historically understandable in principle, but left a third of the population stateless)",0,1326139685,null,0,false,0,c3fi21q,t3_o931w,t1_c3fi21q,t1_c3ffzd6,null,1428150780,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

But there's no reason to go with the German model - and if you go on the French model, how much ""Scots blood"" people in England may or may not have is just kind of irrelevant.

true,almodozo,null,null,"&gt;But the children of British citizens born in France are not French, which they are not

Actually, if they are born in France, children born to British citizens do have the right to French citizenship. Not straight away, but they get it upon reaching the age of 16 or 18 (if they still reside in France or have spent enough time in France). 

So you're right to the extent that the current French model constitutes a slight deviation from extending citizenship automatically to all children born in France right upon birth, as the pure principle of jus soli would have. It used to be like that in France, but at some point in the nineties the government applied this restriction. (Your parents must also actually have been living in France when you were born - they can't just have been on a weekend in Paris - and yes, of course all of this only applies to legal residents, not illegals.) 

But it's only a minor deviation, really. The broad principle remains the same: the right to French citizenship is fundamentally based on whether you were born there - not on how much French blood may or may not be running through your veins. 

This has been the big dividing line in Europe for, I believe, a century or more: the idea of a civic nation, whose memberships is largely determined by jus soli, with France as figurehead, vs. the idea of an ethnic nation, whose membership is largely determined by jus sanguinis, with Germany as its main model.

In fact, you could even argue that the deviation, while chipping away at the original concept of jus soli and a civic nation, in one perspective actually tips the balance further towards territorial ties rather than those of origin: those born in France to foreign parents who chose to stay in France get the passport, while those born in France to foreign parents who moved away too much do not. Residence trumps origin.

That sort of brings us back to this discussion about Scotland. Back-in-black was arguing that according Scottish citizenship by residence would be unfair ""because half of England has Scots blood,"" and said that it was only logical for them to have a say because ""last time I checked the Germans were still handing out citizenship to those of 'German' descent."" But there's no reason why Scotland should follow the German descent-based model of citizenship. Hell, even Germany has been backing away from that model. 

So I don't really see why the Scottish government would have to unpack any thorny issue about how much ""Scots blood"" would be needed to qualify as new Scottish citizen at all. Just go, at the very least, with a jus soli-based model, according anyone born in Scotland Scottish citizenship - and if anything, go even further, and follow the by now fairly  commonplace precedent of newly independent countries that includes most former Soviet republics, and accord citizenship to all current legal residents of Scotland as well. 

&gt;So your suggestion is anyone legally living in Scotland at the time of the vote gets to vote but any Scots not living in Scotland at the time of the vote don't get to vote ...?

All of the above was about citizenship, as per back-in-black's comment. But re who gets to vote in the referendum, eh, again I would just go on precedent, and involve as few questions of 'blood' as possible. As with, say, the Ukrainian or Slovenian independence referenda, give any current legal resident of Scotland the right to vote in it. Nobody gets to vote for the independence just because they have 'Scots blood'. The only problematic category I see left is that of those who were born in Scotland and only moved out in the course of their life.

Te voy a dar mi valoración de Valencia como comunidad (Generalitat Valenciana), como provincia, y como ciudad (capital), donde he vivido gran parte de mi vida… 

La ""Comunitat Valenciana"" es un timo, no hay nada de comunidad ni sentimiento de pertenencia entre los pueblos de una provincia y otra. Toda la comunitat destaca por su fama de ser el vertedero veraniego de turistas - tanto extranjeros como nacionales (perdón, madrileños). La costa valenciana es la más triste de España - descuidada, turismo barato y sin clase, y la peor planificación urbanística del país. La corrupción se ve en todo lado. 

Como provincia, quizás Valencia solo destaque por la producción de la naranja, porque poca cosa más tiene que fardar - a no ser que cuentes los pelotazos y monumentos faraónicos que el PP se ha construido como quien se alarga el pene para tener más autoestima: ciudad de las ciencias, el nuevo puerto de Valencia (que es bastante cutre, incluso comparado con el del grao de Castellón, y nada que comparar con digamos Alicante), copa américa, formula 1… y demás tonterías. 

Coger esta ciudad como destino es algo que yo no entendería, tienes mil destinos mejores al rededor del mundo. En España mismo está Barcelona, mucho más interesante, y el norte, mucho más cuidado, verde, y vistoso. 

Si lo que buscas es jubilarte, quizás te guste Valencia. Si eres relativamente joven y vas a trabajar, mira para otro lugar. Apenas hay inversión en esa ciudad en nada que no sea un chanchullo político.


Eso sí, no quiero decir que todo sea malo. Me encanta visitar, pero no volvería nunca para vivir, esa época ya pasó a mejor vida. No compres casa, si quieres tener una experiencia de la zona, alquila en todo caso, pero no compres. Mucho menos cuando es de las comunidades donde más especulación hubo y donde menos calidad tienen las viviendas construidas. 

Si aún así te empeñas en estar en Valencia ciudad, olvídate de los barrios periféricos. Búscate algo céntrico o tirando a la playa (norte del cauce porque el Saler no tiene nada salvo restaurantes donde comer paella sobrevalorada). Otra cosa, prácticamente todo restaurante valenciano dice tener la mejor paella, y todo valenciano de campo dice saber hacerla mejor que nadie… pero todo es mentira, así que cuando te lo digan aprende a verlo con algo de humor… qué cachondos son.

a) either country might leave the EU
b) even within the EU, there are differences. For example, if Scotland signed up to Schengen, then England would, I presume, put in border checks on the scottish border.

Possibly if this money is virtual money, and one wanted to convert this to euro notes then you would have to pay some charges for handling that such large amount of money.

Wrong, wage increases were slightly above inflation.

Why would they not? If they're born in England (or Wales or N-Ireland) and they live there, of course they could keep on voting there, just like now.

&gt;I think disenfranchising people of that ilk is a bit prejudicial.

They wouldn't be disenfranchised. They would have the right to vote where they live, like most of us.

&gt;A lot of highly talented Scottish people have left Scotland and a lot of these people have children of voting age and these children might well have a contribution of some value to make. Cutting them off from the land of their fathers and mothers seems unkind.

I dunno - to me, personally, giving people the right to vote and the right to citizenship in a land where they never even lived, because of blood ties, seems a little archaic. I mean, I know the Germans and some others still do it, but even the Germans are putting restrictions in place, in order to limit the inflow of people from Russia and elsewhere who had some German ancestor or other but had never even been to Germany. In this day and age, I just find it kind of odd to give people the right to vote in a country where they don't live, never lived, and weren't born, just because of the ethnicity of the blood running through their veins.

Mind you, that's just my personal opinion. The broader point here is that there's no particular necessity for the Scottish government to unpack this particular hornet's nest. There's perfectly legitimate and commonplace precedents, referring to the French rather than the German model of citizenship resp. referring to the citizenship models of most newly independent states in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union, for drawing the lines of citizenship by birth and/or residence, instead of getting into the whole issue of ancestries and other proofs of ethnic identity.

No, it's not a good thing to only cut public wages.

Alright, so I'll add my two cents.

I am not a lawyer. The following is not legal advice.

What you got was probably an Abmahnung, which is just about the same thing as a cease-and-desist letter.

This Abmahnung declares that you are suspected of distributing copyrighted material unlawfully and demands a Unterlassungserklärung, that is, a declaration that you will not do it again. The letter probably contains a template for this Unterlassungserklärung. You should never use this template because it goes a lot further than what you are legally required to.

You have several options:

1. Do nothing. **don't do that.**
2. Sign the template and send it back, but not pay the fees. **don't do that either**
3. Sign the template and send it back and pay the fees **don't do that either**
4. Find a template for a *modifizierte Unterlassungserklärung* (e.g. [here](http://abmahnwahn-dreipage.de/)), send that back, and pay the fees. **this is safe to do but expensive**
5. Find a template for a *modifizierte Unterlassungserklärung*, send that back, and **don't** pay the fees. **I did that myself and it worked. But it's risky.**
4. Go to a lawyer who specializes in this matter. The lawyer will make a recommendation to either make a *modifizierte Unterlassungserklärung* for you, completely contest the charges, or something in-between. **this is safest but can be more expensive than option 3**

My recommendation: You should spend a lot of time researching this on the internet. Start at the [page](http://abmahnwahn-dreipage.de/) I already linked. **Be careful, there is lots of conflicting information**. Then you can decide whether you think you can handle it on your own, or look for a lawyer to handle it.

Also: **Stop torrenting copyrighted materials**.",0,1326207037,null,0,false,0,c3fr7c0,t3_oar8z,t1_c3fr7c0,t3_oar8z,null,1428155155,19,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,19

America today is a parody of those ideals. Wealth is the top priority and it is no longer possible to achieve the 'American dream' because everyone else who could do it before you has done it and has the money to ensure you don't touch theirs. Since they have the money, they have the power to legislate; after all, they've got friends in the right places. They're the money movers and they like to get their way.

Democracy in America is corrupt and over-reliant on individualism as an excuse for the failings of their system. In the 21st Century, nobody should have to go without and starve to death, and that is the cornerstone and result of socialism; genuine humanitarian legislation that isn't about ensuring Bobby Jones with his $300bn wealth is comfy, but ensuring his less well off cousin with $5 to his name gets healthcare, food, water and a house because he too is meant to have his place in society and be able to contribute.

South European governments then need to restructure so that they still have some money left to repay their debt after they've paid for all their schools, hospitals, roads and pensions.

South European nations also need the euro at a level that allows them to export their product.

This will give them the chance of maintaining enough of their tax base to function so they can begin to export themselves to a balanced budget.

Despite recent falls the euro is still overvalued for the South.

European interest rate need to fall more and with the downward pressure on inflation gratis the recession we're all about to get that should be fine.

It seems that the ability of the South to take the pain they are renders all this perfectly achievable but until the guys in the North get their heads around it, they are not going to be able to get the guys in the South to take the further pain of restructuring.

Why politicans/people/news gets those basic facts wrong is a big question with a big complex answer that I am not studied enough to know, but I have one point that might help understand the situation.  There's a big portion of the country who are taught that if they believe something hard enough, it becomes true.  This, combined with the American exceptionalism that we are taught (AMERICA IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY EVER) results in a ""If it feels right to me, it IS right"" attitude.  Nuance and accuracy get thrown out in favor of appealing to what people ""feel"" is right.  Intellectuals who have studied the issue and present an opposing viewpoint must be ivory tower professors with no idea how the ""real world"" works.

If you listen to conservative voters being interviewed, they always say ""...in my heart"" or ""I believe that..."" or ""I feel that..."" and it drives me nuts.  Who the hell cares what you believe.

In america such things doesn't even exist! (their public broadcasting is a different thing). Their entire tv-media is private, and european channels show me how critical they are supposed to be.

short version: you signed something... bad :S

So the form you signed is not filled out correct. You did not fill out the bank-data part.
Better: you crossed it out!

So, because of this, you might have chance.

My advice: call them, tell them you will not pay. Tell them you crossed out the bank-data part on the form to ensure that you DON'T WANT to pay for anything. Tell them that the guy/girl who offered you this ""free"" subscription said, that it would be fine this way for you.
Tell them that you have been tricked, and you will not pay. Tell them, that you NEVER EVER wanted to pay for anything and that you made this on the form unambiguous clear.

This might be your only chance. Mind for self confident voice when you're at the phone. Say also that you've read about similar court decissions on the internet, where people
If you don't get any further with the tricked-into-subscription/formal-defect at the phone, then give it up.

The other way around for capitalism. How it leads to corrupt government where companies take control. And the other side how it leads to individual freedom, American dream etc.

In all cases it is used as propaganda and reality is a far cry from the actual definitions. It's all just words. We are in a position where we can see this. In both cases there is limited power of the people. As soon as the people can exert their powers, societies become more positive towards human rights and all the good stuff. Humans are naturally empathic creatures.

**There's no list, and there hasn't ever been one.**

Whenever a child is born, responsible adults (which include the midwife and anybody aware of the birth) have the legal obligation to declare the birth to the « état-civil » (I'll explain in the next paragraph), which is most of the time at the city hall of the place of birth.

The « état-civil » is the centralized administration for the recording of names, births, marriages (and divorces) and death. It is a direct inheritance from the French Revolution: that job had up to then been done by the church(es) for religious purposes.

The employees of the city hall receive the declaration and record the name that the responsible adult (usually the father) states for the child.

The only thing that can happen at this point is that the employee states his view that the chosen name is **derogatory for the child.**

If the parents refuse to change the name, the employee will report to his manager, who can either accept the name or escalate further (usually by consulting the specialized office at the Interior Ministry.)

Rarely (less than once a year), there is a case where the parents insist against the advice of the civil servants. That case is then **deferred to family court** and handled by a judge.

The only guiding principle is that the child is powerless against receiving a name that could be hurtful later, and thus should be protected. The ""interest of the child"" is considered to be the only issue that judges in the family court should take into account.

**TLDR**: a judge probably won't let you name your child « trouducul » (""asshole""), but almost anything else goes.",0,1326269815,null,0,false,0,c3g236t,t3_obaoo,t1_c3g236t,t3_obaoo,null,1428160354,9,false,france,t5_2qhjz,9

true,Seefor,DENK,Copenhagen,"I never said they were idiots. The US is a fantastic society which has accomplished a lot. The US is still in the top 10 or 20 in most of the factors I mentioned, so it is an amazing system relative to the rest of the world. I just wanted to point out that the Republicans should think twice before degrading and insulting our societies, which in some cases are more succesful than the American system.

As to our income taxes, this is true. A welfare state requires higher taxes. What you prefer comes down to personal preferences. Would you  rather see increases in the factors I've listed, or would you rather have lower taxes.

As a side note, there is no 60 % marginal tax anymore. The maximum tax you can pay today [is 56.1 %](http://www.skm.dk/tal_statistik/tidsserieoversigter/1292.html). And that is only on income above $67,000, after which a ""top tax"" of 15 % is added. The average income tax rate under this level of income, which some 60 % of the population never earn more than, is then 41.1 %.

Then there is of course a sales tax of 25 %, a tax on cars of 180 % and various other green taxes on energy, fuel and water consumption. When you add it all up it is estimated that an average family pays about 50-55 % of its income to the government.

However, you have to remember that this is not money that is just lost. For this they get free kindergardens, free schools, free university (students even get $1,000 a month for attending) and free health care. There's also paid maternity leave (and paternity), child subsidies etc. And if things go wrong for you there's a social security net which ensures that you'll always have a decent living of minimum $2,000 a month, which is raised if you have children. The municipalities are also obliged to provide (decent) housing to everyone.

So, if you add that up how much did the Danish average family then pay to the government, if you subtract what they get from the government? That's difficult to calculate, because that of course depends on how much they use government services. But if you are not a top earner, you will on average get much than you pay, because our progressive tax system makes sure that top earners pay more. Is that fair? That of course depends on if you define fair as liberty from taxes or social justice by wealth redistribution from rich to poor. In my personal opinion, since we know that a person's happiness is not increased by more money once they reach a certain income, it makes more sense to redistribute some of that wealth to increase happiness more effectively in the rest of society. Especially since that will also increase the happiness of the rich, by creating a society with low crime and corruption and high trust levels. Those are factors we know have a large influence on the happiness of everyone. 

As a side note, it is also interesting to ask how much of their income would an average American family have to pay out of their own pocket for the services that are provided by the government in Denmark?",0,1326275066,null,0,true,0,c3g2idi,t3_oap5i,t1_c3g2idi,t1_c3fw4wf,null,1428160552,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

The interplay of interest rates with the demand for a currency that flows from the demand for the goods (tangible and intangible) ultimately payed for in that currency;

The variations in exchange rates caused by relative strength in other currencies;

Using exchange rate variation and inflation as tools (a bit like fire ... a good tool but a terrible master);

I think a lot of people, including the Germans, have not taken on board the importance of the variation in inflation rates within the euro;  

I suspect the inflation rate over time between Portugal and Finland may well be quite different but as it is subsumed and expressed as one number - the euro inflation rate, people lose focus of the importance of this

That is true, and that is not what I was objecting too. 


What I (and I think several other people)are objecting to is that educated people, who are trying to become the most powerful man in the world, all of them in politics, do not know the basic definition of different political ideologies.


[Socialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) is an economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and cooperative management of the economy; or a political philosophy advocating such a system.


The [social democrats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy) of today can be described as people eho wants a  modern social democracy, one view presented calls for the profound reformation of capitalism to align it with the ethical ideals of social justice while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system.


a)the social democrats do not want to let the workers have ownership of the productions. 

b)most countries in Europe are not even governed by social democrats, certainly not Germany/France and the UK,the biggest ones. 


So, either you have presidential candidates that truly believes that Obama and Europe want all the means of productions to be owned by the workers for example, no private ownership and all that, which to me is baffling. Do they truly believe that Merkel wants no more private ownership?She grew up in the DDR for God's sake- she is firmly against socialism because of that.Do they think Cameron is not going to allow private companies? Do you think Obama is not going to allow you to on your business?


*or*


Are they mixing up socialism with social democrats?The fact that they can do that is baffling to most Europeans, we do learn different political definitions in school (as I suppose you do as well), and this is one of the basic one, to be filed under general knowledge together with the capital of India and knowing who Nelson Mandela  is.

I don't know which one these explenations it is, but both of them seem strange and scary.

Euro membership upped the money supply and the credit availability and lending policies were mad. Partly our own fault but partly the money markets fault too. Bank regulation is relatively simple but the creation of "" virtual"" money i.e not in bill/note form is an altogether different game. 

This credit supply funded the housing boom.

It is the currency stability and low volatility that benefited Germany. 

Austria is to Germany as Ireland is to the United Kingdom so of course Austria benefits substantially from a prosperous Germany. Basic economics , Adam Smith and absolute advantage and comparative advantage will tell you that.

The mechanism suits Germany because the basic tool of the economist , currency devaluation, was not available to national governments. Neither was interest rate policy.

- Und weil ich so gemein war.
- Sie wollte sie nicht aufsetzen.

- Sie hat geweint, und ich habe gesagt, dass sie sich nicht anstellen soll.

The grammar in this case is more or less the same, even though people often use perfect tense in cases where English speakers would use past tense as it's more common to use perfect tense to express events in the past. Normally you're supposed to use perfect tense if the past event has still effect to the current events or is still lasting on, but Germans tend to use perfect tense even in sentences where this is not the case.

Before that, there were changes in the official criteria that were officially supposed to be guidelines for accepting or refusing a name. They would mostly refer to « tradition » which is a catch-all...

None of it would theoretically matter, since the family court judge would base his decision on the interest of the child.

Besides, since France is an immigration country, if you wanted an uncommon name, you'd just tell the city hall clerk that it came from the Zorglubistan side of your family.

So 16% of the EU population can set the economic policy for the other 84%.

I do not think the Scotsman will like that or think it fair. 

&gt;Sure, the European Union is a fundamentally protectionist project. That shouldn't really surprise anyone. Of course it sucks when you're left out of such agreements, but in the case of the UK, that is purely by choice.

In the case of the UK their stance is being vindicated that the Euro was just a big con or swindle. 

It is predatory and assumes that all the Eurozone member states will stand firm over time. This is hardly winning friends for Germany nor is it likely. 

It is not just an internal EU matter. For example, what is to stop the UK &amp; the US reaching a seperate trade agreement or in fact.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Well, since you gave me such an impressive demonstration of the power of at least two important psychological effects, I'll take the time to give you a short explanation so you can better follow the debates.

There are two different kinds of interest rates that you frequently hear about. The one you're thinking of is set by the central bank as its main policy instrument. You can think of it as the price that banks pay for new money, and it indirectly affects the money supply and inflation. It's by no means direct, more like steering a fast paced supertanker in water with a lot of current, but it does influence monetary supply and inflation. The ECB has [an educational game](http://www.ecb.int/ecb/educational/economia/html/index.en.html) that you can play to learn more.

What the article talks about, however, are interest rates that are payed on debt, like on government bonds. Those are affected by the first one, but in this context, it's about the risk premium on possible inflation and exchange rate fluctuation that investors demand. So, how did the euro save countries money that they would have otherwise had to spend on interest?

Bonds have a maturity date on which they have to be repaid, and often that's many years in the future. So, let's say it's 1990, and you're trying to decide whether you should buy German or Greek ten-year government bonds. You don't know yet how their respective currencies will develop over the coming decades, and how much will be lost to inflation. However, Germany has a well known obsession with inflation, and tries to keep it low and stable. Greece, on the other hand, has inflation of around 20% (!), sometimes more, sometimes less. You have a pretty good idea about how much you will be able to buy with the money Germany will repay you, but not so much with Greece -- they might decide to devalue their currency further to lower their debt load, i.e., what they owe you. Will it be the historic 20% per year? Or will they push it even further? So, you'll take that into consideration, and demand a relatively high interest rate to balance out any effects this might have, with a tendency to err on the safe side.  
Enter the euro. Suddenly they can't devalue their currency anymore, and Greek interest rates effectively become German ones. There even is a clause in the Treaty of Maastricht that explicitly states that members of the Eurozone won't have to bail each other out, so the Greeks would have to be crazy to overload themselves with debt they can't devalue, right? There still is a premium to cover the risk of default, but the Greek fundamentals look good on paper, so it's low -- the ""spread"", i.e., the difference between Greek [ten-year bonds](http://cheznick.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/ez-bond-yields.jpg) and German ones used to be slightly above a quarter of a percent between 2001, when Greece entered the Eurozone, and the onset of the financial crisis in 2007. The prospect of them having to meet the criterion to join the Eurozone alone had a substantial effect on the interest rates that Greece had to pay.  
And this is how the euro saved them money through lower interest rates, what they would have had to pay in risk premiums to cover loss of value of their currency. Not just in terms of buying power, but relative to other currencies -- a French investor could lend them money without having to take the exchange rate risk between the franc and the drachma into account. Even Germany payed lower interests with the euro. Credit became cheap and easily available, not just for the government but also for businesses and consumers.

There are other ways how the euro saved money, through removing the exchange rate risk in transnational long term contracts, but that's another topic.",0,1326309288,null,0,false,0,c3g6sns,t3_obb6n,t1_c3g6sns,t1_c3g3jos,null,1428162638,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Take the one by the central bank. Unless we're talking about the ECB, which as somebody interested in macroeconomics you probably know is a special case because it has the single goal of keeping inflation stable at just below 2%, then a central bank typically has the two additional objectives of keeping employment high and the economy growing. So, if growth is too low, or even negative, they lower the interest rate to reduce the cost of credit, to increase liquidity so banks can lend to businesses more cheaply and they can invest and grow, whereas they increase it to tighten money supply to keep inflation low and prevent the economy from overheating if it grows too quickly. I.e., a low central bank rate is indeed a tool but it also means that the central bank believes that the economy needs help to grow.

The other interest rate, the one that investors demand of governments, can be seen as an indicator because if they're low it expresses the market's faith in a government's ability to raise enough money through taxes on a healthy economy to service its debt. High interest rates here indicate that investors demand a premium to cover the risk of loss of value of the currency, or even default.

There are one or two streets in El Raval which are still somewhat dodgy, even during the day, but as you'll be traveling together, just *enjoy* but try and make sure you aren't the most obvious target that thieves see walking around.  They are opportunistic, so if you two are obviously aware of your surroundings, well, then there's not a lot more you can do.

The center is small enough that you will be hoofing it most of the time, btw.  Hotels a bit north of Pl.Catalunya are still fine for a late-night return from going out in El Born.

I'm not the biggest fan of Barcelona's beach, but it will do - considering that you will be staying in the city, I would not bother going to a different beach.  Unless you have a lot of time, but you haven't told us that.

And the Irish Viceroys of India built a lot of nice real estate in Ireland.

For the last 800 years the Welsh and English, despite their differences, have pretty much fought well together.

And despite Stanley Baker, a Welshman getting the ethnicity of the troopers as Rorkes Drift wrong, the singing scene expresses a reality of the co-operation that has existed between the Welsh and the English.

At that awful mess up at Bannockburn in 1314, one of the few Southern units to retire in good order was a battalion of 500 of Welsh longbow men.   

And having seen the Welsh in action, I can most assuredly assure you, they are psychos and you want them on your side.

And they can sing.
