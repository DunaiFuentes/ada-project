true,Impedence,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; The only reason some want it to be a European-wide taxation is to avoid having everyone going to trade to the untaxed place (and they hope/believe that the EU is too big to be avoided (especially if the US join)).

The USA dislikes wealth taxes, and withdrew from the Kyoto agreement on the basis of loss of competitiveness to the far east. I **really** doubt they will join, and even if they did, it would be Hong Kong, Singapore, and Zurich that the business would go to, instead of New York. That's a terrible argument.

&gt; But nobody said anything about giving this money to the EU (you know they can't levy taxes, right)

Firstly, there are plenty of people who would like to use this money on an EU level, for example the MEP [Anni Podimata](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/39317/Anni_PODIMATA.html) certainly does, whose report on a FTT is being voted on in the European parliament soon ([the amended report is here](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;reference=A7-2012-0154&amp;language=EN)) in [an interview](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/content/20120521STO45442/html/Financial-transaction-tax-discouraging-risky-financial-speculation) with the europarl news she even says at the end:

&gt; *The potential of the tax as en EU own resource is impressive. The Commission has calculated that should two thirds of the financial transaction tax revenue be managed at EU level, the national contributions based on gross national income could be reduced by up to 50%.*

That sounds a lot like giving the money to the EU.

Oh, and no the EU doesn't levy tax directly, but they do make member states levy taxes on their behalf. Under the [traditional own resources](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/explained/budg_system/financing/fin_en.cfm) section you see that the EU delegates the collection of its import taxes to the member states.

Vielleicht hätte ich Shooter auch nicht so schlecht darstellen sollen ... auch wenn ich es immer langweilig finde, wenn minutenlange Aktionen in wenigen Sekundenbruchteilen kulminieren ... aber ich find deshalb auch Motorsport langweilig. Ingenieure würden vom Duty Cycle reden, ich seh bei sowas immer zu viel Leerlauf.

Wo war ich. Tiefe in Diablo 3. Sicher, es gibt da Ansätze. Aber das Spiel legt darauf nicht den Schwerpunkt; es funktioniert nicht weil es taktisch ist, und es zieht seine Langzeitmotivation nicht aus kognitiver Stimulation des Spielers. Dagegen ist zwar nix einzuwenden, aber das rückt es imho schon arg in die Nähe der Casual Games, die ja auch irgendwann zwischen dem ersten und dritten Teil von Diablo entstanden sind. In diesem Spannungsfeld zwischen kurzfristiger Beschäftigung durch Primärreize, und andererseits langfristiger Motivation durch Entwicklung (cf. alte Adventures) hat sich D3 irgendwie nicht so günstig positioniert. Find ich.

Zwei Dinge gibts noch, die ich potentiell als Probleme kenne, ich hab mir das Spiel aber nicht genau genug angeschaut. Vielleicht kannst du dazu was sagen.

1) Die Bestrafung fürs Scheitern. Bei D3 wird die irgendwann künstlich erhöht (Hardcore oder wie das heißt), jedenfalls entsteht beim Spieler Stress um möglichst nicht zu sterben. Ich finde aber, die Bestrafung sollte möglichst niedrig sein (etwa: Super Meat Boy), um den Spieler zu ermutigen, sich schnell zu verbessern. Darin liegt für mich ein Großteil des Reizes; viele Spiele setzen den Spieler aber unter Druck, ja nicht zu scheitern (etwa bei Starcraft die Ladder Anxiety).

2) Die Balance zwischen Über- und Unterforderung ist enorm schwer zu treffen. Entweder man frisst sich durch die Monsterhorden durch als wärs nix, oder man läuft ständig dagegen, stirbt, probiert nochmal, stirbt, probiert nochmal, und sammelt nicht genügend Erfahrungspunkte bzw. Waffen, um besser zu werden. In beiden Fällen wirds schnell langweilig. Ich würde Blizzard jetzt zutrauen, das perfekt in den Griff zu kriegen, jedoch war ich bei Diablo II noch ständig unterfordert bis irgendwo im 4. Akt, wo ich die Wahl hatte ständig gegen Diablo etc. zu sterben ohne XP zu bekommen, oder durch die Vor-Dungeons zu laufen und zu gewinnen, ebenfalls ohne XP zu bekommen. Wegen dem und anderer Momente wurde das Spiel schlagartig langweilig. Wie macht D3 das?

It's a two-way street, however.  If Greece won't collect taxes or trim its spending, it will forever drain huge sums of money from northern Europe, and for no good reason.

In the US, the national government has few qualms about depriving a state of certain funds if the state does not comply with the conditions attached to those funds (there are exceptions for a few environmental protection programs).  As a result, the states keep in line, for the most part, and if they choose to be defiant, as some do, that's their choice: they don't have to follow the rule in question and they loose the funds that would have come with it.

The relatively young age of the EU makes this a bit of a different scenario, as does the potential rise of fascism or communism in Greece.

There are federal laws that provide subsidies for things like agriculture, and there are also national programs (Medicare, Medicaid) that help provide health care for people who are elderly, children, disabled, or very poor.  The spending on health care assistance is certainly the vast majority of the re-distributed money.  

This type of re-distribution is not the same as paying off a state's debts.  The states did not incur debt and then ask other states to pay for it; rather, there are national programs, passed by Congress and the President rather than state governments, which receive more funding from wealthier states because those states make more money and thus, via the income tax, contribute more to the national government's budget than the poorer states do.  This can be described as a wealth transfer if you calculate how much tax money the poorer states contributed to federal programs like Medicare, and then subtract the amount of Medicare etc. money that they received.  If you get a negative number for a certain state, there was wealth transferred to that state.  Each state is still responsible for its own debt.

Ok, here is how I will put it: Americans do not view reality TV as being important in the way they think sports are important.  If so-called ""reality"" shows are partially scripted, we can live with that. 

But cheating or unfairness in sports is taboo.  Look at our obsession with instant play-backs and consider the Congressional investigation of steroid use in baseball.

The fact that soccer referees can make whatever call they want, with no instant playback or video record or any way to challenge the ref's decision, and the fact that refs occasionally abuse that power, is one factor that makes non-Hispanic Americans a bit disinterested in the global soccer scene.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; By December 2009, [according to the Bank for International Settlements](http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qa1203.pdf), German banks had amassed claims of $704 billion on Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, much more than the German banks’ aggregate capital.

The linked source is for the end-of-2011 figures. The one for 2009 [is here](http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qa1006.pdf). The table is 9B, [here](http://imgur.com/a/cQkLz) are the relevant bits.

Anyway, total claims by German banks on the GIIPS at the end of 2009 was $704bn. At the end of 2011, this was down to $474bn, which is $230bn less.  
But wait, didn't Bloomberg write something about $353bn? Well, if you read carefully, this number refers to *all* Eurozone countries, not only the GIIPS:

&gt; One indicator would be the amount German banks pulled out of other euro-area countries since the crisis began. According to the BIS, they yanked $353 billion from December 2009 to the end of 2011 (the latest data available).

I have to admit that I don't know where this figure is coming from. When I add the claims on Eurozone countries, I end up with $1,379bn in 2009, and $1,159bn in 2011, but that's only $220bn less. In any case, they put total reductions of claims on all Eurozone countries against an initial figure that only related to the GIIPS.  

Then they throw in a third €340bn figure, this time one that only relates to Greece:

&gt; By comparison, Greece has received a total of about 340 billion euros in official loans to recapitalize its banks, replace fleeing capital, restructure its debts and help its government make ends meet.

Those consist of €30bn from the IMF, €80bn from the Greek Loan Facility, €130bn from the EFSF, and the €100bn default on debt held by banks. Germany's share of IMF loans is about 6%, and it's about 27% of the ones by the GLF and EFSF, or about €58.5bn.

&gt; Only about 15 billion euros of that has come directly from Germany. The rest is all from the ECB, the EU and the International Monetary Fund.

Now they seem to compare the figure of the total package including *future payments* and the default with Germany's share of what *had been payed* out at the end of 2011. There don't seem to be even two numbers in this article that are in any relation to each other, ""by comparison"" or not. (Also: the EU isn't the same as the Eurozone, and even if there were payments by the ECB included in this figure, Germany would still pay those 27%.)

Anyway, since they're now only talking about Greece: The figures for claims by German banks against Greece by itself were only $45bn in 2009 and $37bn in 2011. That's nothing like the initial $704bn figure, or that $353bn reduction.  
It's true, though, that once all bailout packages have been payed out, almost all of the Greek debt that they haven't defaulted on will have been rolled over from the banks to Eurozone taxpayers, and it's unlikely that they'll get all of it back. Of this eventual loss, German tax payers will assume only about a quarter. Which is about what German banks owned as a share of Greek debt that was held by Eurozone banks at the end of 2009.

&gt; Now any losses will be shared with the taxpayers of the entire euro area -- particularly France, whose banks still have a lot of outstanding loans to Greece.

Yeah, they still had about $43bn from their initial $75bn left at the end of 2011. Which means they pulled out about as much as German, Dutch and Irish banks combined.

&gt; Here’s how it worked. When German banks pulled money out of Greece, the other national central banks of the euro area collectively offset the outflow with loans to the Greek central bank. These loans appeared on the balance sheet of the Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank, as claims on the rest of the euro area. This mechanism, designed to keep the currency area’s accounts in balance, made it easier for the German banks to exit their positions.

They appear to be talking about TARGET2. The way I understood it is that those would be claims on the Greek central bank alone. Great to hear Bloomberg says they're backed by the Eurozone as a whole. 

Anyway, I understand they're trying to make a point. But they should try to make it honestly. To me it seems as if this article is intentionally misleading.",0,1337916582,null,0,false,0,c4s3u4c,t3_u3e2q,t1_c4s3u4c,t3_u3e2q,null,1428995975,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Also, Americans don't understand why FIFA won't allow instant-replay cameras to verify the accuracy of the referee's calls.  I also recall hearing a sports commentator on TV saying that Europeans enjoy the bias of their referees, seeing it as an added layer of drama and challenge, such as: ""Can Manchester win even though the referee is against them?""  It's like the thrill of winning despite an openly biased referee is part of the attraction of the game for Europeans, as are the European national rivalries that the referees' biases represent.  I can understand that, but Americans don't really tend to enjoy that kind of situation in sports, especially when the bias is heavily against them whenever they try to compete with the big, famous soccer teams.

Perhaps that last point is the most important one: there is a feeling, at least among myself and some other Americans, that the international soccer community is biased against the US and wants to see us lose, and nothing will be done if referees act upon that sentiment in ways that tarnish the fairness of the game.

I don't follow soccer, so forgive me if any of my information is a bit dated.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes I watched that USA game where the referee burned you guys and I was really pissed aswell. The thing is that referee is crap, and he has been known to give dodgy decisions in Africa aswell. Thats the thing, there are very few actually corrupt referees but there are tons of shit ones. Refereeing in soccer is hard as, as you say, there are no replays to help. 

Its not that Europeans like the bias of a referee (referees receive alot of heat, even death threats when they make wrong calls, if there were refs that were actually biased it would not go down well). Its that alot like the randomness of having referees who can screw up. They like the ""human aspect of the game"". However increasingly fans are getting pissed at wrong calls and now most people would probably want technology (me not being part of that crowd however)

There are rumours that ref help teams, and sometimes statistics will show that certain teams get more favourable calls than others (Howard Webb for Manchester Utd). In some leagues there is corruption (Italy, East Europe, Africa, some latin Americans, Asia). But in the ""more developed"" countries (no offence Italy :)) and definitely in the big competitions there really isnt any, atleast to my opinion. Youll always find conspiracy theorists who will tell you the opposite.

I do agree that the US has been hard done by referees recently. In 2006 Ghana scored a goal with a fould, the US had an unfair penalt given against them, and in 2010 the imaginary call. What can I say.. this things happen in football and I can understand American's frustrations. The English also think they are hard done by refs (Lampard's goast dissalowed goal vs Germany, dissalowed goals for Sol Campbell in extra time in 98 and 2004) and there was a time when the French felt like this aswell.

Is there any basis to US fears? Well quite possibly, and small teams have often times complained that they get hard done by refs in comparison to big teams. However, there is no conspiracy against a particular team, and there is no accepted or openwide bias of refs",0,1337927585,null,0,false,0,c4s5mng,t3_u3ba4,t1_c4s5mng,t1_c4s50ih,null,1428996820,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

In Italy right now most politicians are quite old - a recent report stated that they are the oldest in Europe - and they are quite set in their ways. Older people are generally more averse to changes, and new people have a hard time getting into the system, since electoral laws are made by the current parliament. We have a system that tries to protect itself and during elections you have to choose one of the 'big' parties or risk having your vote wasted.

Americans tend to be more open and friendly than Europeans.  There are more of us, and we share a smaller space and a very long history and because of this, we are well schooled at staying out of each others business.  This makes us appear reserved and uptight, but under the surface we seethe with passions that Americans don't seem to have.  That's our culture.  It's deep and long and ingrained, and causes us as many problems as it does pleasures.

Europeans are more complicated than homespun Americans.  Thats not a criticism, it's just that with the exception of the largest US cities, life is just simpler and easier in the US.  There's more space, fewer cultural differences and more homogeneity. 

Anyway.  I'm sure we'll all remain friends for the long term.  Just please keep your stupid moronic religions to yourselves, and we'll get along just fine. (We have our own complex moronic religions already and we hate to be evangelised to by our own retarded children!)

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"&gt;But this assumes that we first have to trick people into having a superstate by some forceful measure, before we decide to tell them that now they of course would want democracy.

This is not correct. I am an ardent federalist, a conclusion I have come to of my own volition. There are millions of Europeans who feel the same way. Of course, part of European integration has been facilitated by political leaders artificially putting forth a pan-European identity. This is a necessity for a federal state to function. The EU is a confederation. Confederations, as decentralized as they are, still need a semblance of unity to operate, lest they risk collapse. This unity is a result of decades of integration, fostered by Europeans from all walks of life.

&gt;That's a ponzy scheme, really. How can there be democracy if people didn't want to give up sovereignity in the first place? Who's gonna vote? Who's gonna be positively passionate about something they want to tear down ASAP?

The issue of surrendering sovereignty has more to do with political leaders than the electorate. The electorate has very little say in the EU because political leaders have kept it that way, so as to retain as much national sovereignty as possible. You don't need to surrender sovereignty to make the EU more democratic, but it does make it a lot easier. The current EU could make the Commission an outgrowth of the legislature, like most other parliamentary systems, and the President of the European Council could be popularly elected. There has been an idea set forth of merging the posts of the Commission President and President of the European Council. This is an interesting idea because it would create a single, more powerful, executive of the EU. The problem is that without this President's mandate coming for direct election or parliamentary support, it is undemocratic. As such, it would make more sense to either directly elect a super-president (which would also serve to foster more pan-European identity), or to keep the posts separate, one elected, one an outgrowth of the legislature. Surrendering sovereignty to Brussels does not make the EU more democratic. What it does is create favorable circumstances to make the EU more democratic. National leaders are the biggest obstacle to federalism. Sovereignty and democracy are not one in the same. They can exist separately or harmoniously in federations, confederations, or unitary systems.

I'm an American living in Paris. I don't find Parisians particularly rude.  If you're hanging out under a bridge, you're probably going to have some negative experiences.  If you hang out with French redditors in Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, you're going to have a good time.  I know this from experience.  Well, not the bridge part. 

I have only been in one or two situations in which someone was actively rude to me.  In large cities, people have attitude. They are busy people and live/work at a fast pace.  If you get in the way of getting their tasks accomplished, they might be rude.  It's the same in New York City.  It's a big city mentality.  

If you're from New York, you should be toughened up enough to deal with the bad attitude of your local cashier if she's just had a fight with her significant other or something.  Aside from that, people aren't rude for the sake of being rude here.  I've been treated very well by the French and find them very friendly. Some of the rudest individuals I have met while abroad were Americans, no joke. And I'm American.

But even the French will tell you that people are more kind in the countryside, but in my opinion, this rule stands for any country.

As for my most recent ass hole experience... I stopped going to my local Franprix a while back because the girl behind the counter was very rude.  Sometimes I had to wait one or two minutes while she finished texting her friends, and then she would ring me out without saying bonjour, or would sneer at me if I didn't understand something that she said.  I think it has more to do with her being a bratty teenager than being French.  I stopped going there, until today, which I regret doing.  I got another young female cashier, and she was so busy flirting with a new stock boy that she gave me the wrong change, then gave me the wrong change again, then finally gave me what she thought was the right change and shorted me one euro. She was a little snot about it.  Well, I guess that's the last time I go to that Franprix. Their hiring manager needs to get his/her shit together.

And that's how easy it is to avoid rude people.

Indescribable. 

I've read up quite a bit about Operation Gomorrha because I live in and around the areas with the most destruction.

There are quite a lot of recounts of people who lived through it that are very harrowing to read - watching people trying to flee but sinking into melting asphalt and other things. And the only military/industrial complexes at the time were centered around the harbor as far as I recall and were bombed, too - well, justified under the circumstances. But Hamm, Barmbek (I live in Barmbek-Süd), Hammerbrook, Wandsbek etc. were just workers' districts!

No I wouldn't. The article of the word is irrelevant to its meaning - that's why words have completely different articles in different languages.

&gt; Brussels, 24 May 2012

&gt; ...

&gt; The eurozone has shown considerable solidarity, having already **disbursed together with the IMF nearly 150 billion euros** in support of Greece since 2010.

It's completely wrong to add ""€100bn default on debt held by banks"". This was a bond swap proposal to private investors, not an official loan. These money were not held by banks only, and many bondholders bought old bonds at low prices, making a decent profit.

Regarding the ""€130 billion bailout"", here's what happened/will happen.

1) Greece received €35.5 billion in EFSF bonds. That was used to lure private investors to take up the bond swap.

2) €23-50 billions are supposed to be used to recapitalise Greece’s banks. Cue bank runs due to unfortunate statements by third rate unelected Eurocrats, add up banks' losses due to the bond swap.

(There's also a beautiful story that must always be told about the swap. Initially, Germany didn't want it. Others did. Then Germany did want it. Others didn't. After the swap, Germany also didn't. Why? Germany just realised that many Greek entities, other than banks, held Greek bonds. Now, these entities need state funding due to their losses. Not to mention the thousands of Greek citizens that were forced to accept the deal, lost more than half of their money, and can't now pay for their other obligations. Another burden for the tax authorities.)

3) €44.5-71.5 billions might be paid in direct loans, partly funded by the IMF.

Next week, Greek banks are about to receive €18 billions (point 2). From the ""first bailout"", if I'm not mistaken, Greece received €87 out of €110 billions.

As you see, you're both wrong about Greece.

Now, about Germany, despite some mistakes, they do have a point. Personally, I would add France to the mix.

Boy, you don't know the luck you Americans/Brits/anyone who speaks English have. Finding any good *German* series subtitled in *German* is a pain in the ass. The same goes for movies. Yeah, there are hearing-impaired people who'd need them, same goes for foreigners/immigrants wanting to learn the language, but nooo - the few German series that are subtitled are also the most boring/least interesting.

C'mon, fellow Germans, would you voluntarily watch 'Lindenstraße', 'Schwarzwaldklinik' or 'In aller Freundschaft' when there are much better series like 'Türkisch für Anfänger', 'Edel und Starck', 'Berlin, Berlin', 'Großstadtrevier', 'Stromberg', 'Doctor's Diary' (the last one has never been subtitled on German TV, and the DVD boxsets also don't have any subtitles, and all my hearing girlfriends rave about the series to me - yeah, I'm not bitter at all, do you notice any jealousy??) Anyway, if the series has been aired on RTL, SAT1 etc., yeah, there will NEVER be any subtitles - okay, well, 'Alarm für Cobra 11' did have a boxset with subtitles which was quite a surprise to me, with series aired on ARD etc. you *might* have more luck. But otherwise... yeah. It sucks to be deaf and living in Germany when you want to watch what everyone else watches, too. The more popular German soap operas also never get subtitled. I'm not a fan, but I know people who'd love to watch 'Marienhof', 'Unter uns', 'Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten' or 'Alles was zählt', but can't. 

That aside, a great series is 'Im Angesicht des Verbrechens', the boxset I've got is with subtitles in German, English, Spanish, Polish and Russian (languages available are German and French). I'd recommend it without reservation! English title is 'In Face of the Crime', apparently. Max Riemelt (who plays Marek Gorski) is also one of my favorite actors, though Ronald Zehrfeld is also not too bad. Ah, found an IMDB link with an English summary - [here!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1223917/synopsis)

Also, you might have luck with any of the newer Tatort box sets - I've got the 'Thiel/Boerne-Box Vol. 2', which has three episodes with subtitles, and there are bound to be some more out there (protip: look for 'Untertitel für Hörgeschädigte', meaning subtitles for the hearing impaired), just forget about getting the old Tatort episodes with subtitles (no Schimanski afaik, woe is me).

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"&gt; This is not correct. I am an ardent federalist, a conclusion I have come to of my own volition. There are millions of Europeans who feel the same way.

And millions of other Europeans disagree wholeheartedly with your views. Why should those who are in favour of more European integration get their way without all others having their say?

&gt;Of course, part of European integration has been facilitated by political leaders artificially putting forth a pan-European identity. This is a necessity for a federal state to function.

There is no harm done if somebody promotes their ideas in a democratic society. Rather than that, I - and others - take issue with people who skip the ""discussion"" part and move directly on to ""legislation"".

&gt;The EU is a confederation. Confederations, as decentralized as they are, still need a semblance of unity to operate, lest they risk collapse. This unity is a result of decades of integration, fostered by Europeans from all walks of life.

What unity precisely? Where are our star-spangled banners in Athens? If you ever see one, they're aflame. Everywhere I look, I see disunity and petty squabbles among national leaders.

Any civil unity among European nationals seems to me to stem from a shared distrust of their own governments (as well as the European one) and a general dissatisfaction with the current crisis.

In these terms, we are experiencing a sense of unity, but one that is negatively connoted towards opposing the current state of affairs, rather than of a positive, pro-Euroepan spirit. In particular, this unity seems to be temporary in nature, and not one that grew out of a long history of integration.

&gt;The issue of surrendering sovereignty has more to do with political leaders than the electorate. The electorate has very little say in the EU because political leaders have kept it that way, so as to retain as much national sovereignty as possible.

I agree. It serves as a rather proficient scapegoat that way. On the other hand, I wouldn't be surprised if many high officials in Brussels are satisfied with how things are.

&gt;You don't need to surrender sovereignty to make the EU more democratic, but it does make it a lot easier.

How is this relevant? It sounds as if democracy should be an optional result, rather than one of our founding principles.

&gt;The current EU could make the Commission an outgrowth of the legislature, like most other parliamentary systems, and the President of the European Council could be popularly elected. There has been an idea set forth of merging the posts of the Commission President and President of the European Council. This is an interesting idea because it would create a single, more powerful, executive of the EU. The problem is that without this President's mandate coming for direct election or parliamentary support, it is undemocratic. As such, it would make more sense to either directly elect a super-president (which would also serve to foster more pan-European identity), or to keep the posts separate, one elected, one an outgrowth of the legislature. Surrendering sovereignty to Brussels does not make the EU more democratic. What it does is create favorable circumstances to make the EU more democratic.

I agree with you, but I still question whether or not we lose sight of what we should see as the most important issue here. Your response alone talks of the various levels of ease as to which democracy can be introduced, as well as the political neccessities to make democracy function.

Regardless the fact that further integration might very well be opposed by the very people who want more democracy, I'd like to point out the very nature of our discussion: we are asking ourselves how the European Union must change to allow for a true democratic government.

To me, this sentence alone robs any EU-mandated legislation from any representative power. We are democratic nations. To have anybody have any non-democratic authority over us, no matter the realpolitical implications, goes directly against the very core on which any member state of the EU is built.

This shouldn't be an automatic death sentence to the EU, but it should push the question of democratic representation within the EU on the top agenda of anybody who seriously beliefs the Union to be a valuable contribution to the nations of Europe.

And yet, it is treated as an optional side-dish to be warmed-up once the financial sector is dealt with and European dominance successfully secured.

After this has happened, after all, no democratic change will actually decide upon the fate of the Union. It'll be inevitable by then, just as it was so often in is history. This turns any democratic structure into nothing but show.

&gt;National leaders are the biggest obstacle to federalism. 

I disagree. It might just be that a majority of Europeans simply do not want federalism. And they might not want it in the future either, and they might not believe that it is the best way to tackle future problems.",0,1337947546,null,0,1337947796,0,c4s7by3,t3_u2zla,t1_c4s7by3,t1_c4s6c9f,null,1428997628,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

Swedish is also quite similar to both, but not as much as Norwegian and Danish are to each other, so it's not as easy to understand from a Norwegian or Danish point of view. 

And, of course since Sweden has almost the same population as Denmark and Norway combined, there's a bigger audience for Swedish in Sweden. And while it is true that alot of people in Finland speak good Swedish, I don't know how that will be appreciated by the Finnsh people id you try to seak Swedish to them. It is probably better to speak English than Swedish in Finland. The Finns just don't really like Swedish.

Concerning your question though, I'm not really sure. 

I have no problem understanding Swedish, but that's because I live near Sweden and often visit there. In southern/western Norway, or anywhere people don't  really need to be able to understand Swedish they generally won't understand a lot of it either.

As for Danish, I can't see how the Danes even understand eacother when they talk. It's no problem reading it, but when someone speaks it it's just like another language. But it's possible though, if they try to speak slowly and clearly. 

I think it would be easier for a Norwegian to understand someone Austrian speaking Danish than someone Danish speaking Danish, though, so it might work.

I'm not really sure what is easiest for Swedes or Danes to understand. I guess that also depends where in Sweden or Denmark you are, and who you are talking to. 

And as for media, sure theres a bit more in Swedish as it has more speakers, but I don't think theres a lack of media you could use for learning Danish or Norwegian.

I guess which one you want to learn basically just boils down to you're personal preferations. Of course I would recommend Norwegian, as I think it sounds the best, but that's my opinion, and I'm Norwegian so of course I would like my own language best. And it also goes without saying that Norway is the best and most beautiful country. :)

&gt; EBU Director General Ingrid Deltenre has driven home the importance to democracy of a free and independent media, at the Center for Global Dialogue &amp; Cooperation (CGDC) annual meeting, in Vienna. 

&gt;Speaking on the theme of 'Democracy versus Economic Power', Ms Deltenre said strong and independent media were a ""watchdog"", and ""one of the cornerstones of a modern democracy"".

Indeed, a true watchdog. The juxtaposition of that with the fact that the song contest is being held in Azerbaijan, a country known for political repression and not being a cornerstone of democracy is just hilarious.",0,1337954318,null,0,false,0,c4s8808,t3_u3ba4,t1_c4s8808,t1_c4ryr5t,null,1428998042,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; €150bn

The €150bn figure is yet another one, in this case it's the latest total. Bloomberg had decided to go with what had been payed at the end of 2011 when they calculated those €15bn for Germany. Back then, total payouts had only been [€52.9bn by the EZ and €20.1bn by the IMF](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu_borrower/greek_loan_facility/index_en.htm), a total of €73bn.

I've made the distinction between past and future payouts quite clear, I think. It's one of those points I consider intentionally misleading, because they put Germany's share of payouts of a past date in relation to the total program including future payments.

&gt; It's completely wrong to add ""€100bn default on debt held by banks"".

It certainly is, if you're trying to make the point that this is a transfer from Eurozone tax payers to the banks of one country in particular, since taxpayers didn't pay for those €100bn (well, they partially did through the recapitalization program for Greek banks), banks did.

&gt; These money were not held by banks only, and many bondholders bought old bonds at low prices, making a decent profit.

Most of it was held by banks (and insurance companies and retirement funds, but they are included in those figures). The ones held by speculators had been bought off banks that wanted to get Greek bonds off their balance sheet and took the expected loss during the sale. €197bn of claims held by the private sector were reduced by 53.5%. Some may have sold their bonds preemptively for less, in which case speculators made a profit, some may have outsmarted market and got more for their bonds while they still could. But on average, they had to write off half of the face value one way or the other.

Whether those €100bn should be included in the €340bn total depends on how you look at it. The other €240bn at least theoretically will have to be repaid, to they're still technically claims. The €100bn from the default have been written off, this is an actual reduction, no matter how the rest will played out.  
If I understood you correctly, you don't want to count it because you believe it's not money that Greece received -- but technically, Greece received it in form of Greek bonds.

&gt; Personally, I would add France to the mix.

Weren't you the guy who had insisted to look at the bailout contributions on a per capita or per GDP basis?

I don't know if this is a regional thing or something, because most of the people I know actually do answer that question honestly. (I'm a Midwesterner.) In fact, it's a pet peeve of mine when people try to brush it off.

Ironically, here in Europe is where I've found that people don't care about my answering that question honestly. I've been living in Bulgaria for two years and I can barely eke out a sentence before people move the conversation along. I don't know if it's because everyone is just excited to talk to ""the American"" or if my Bulgarian speech is so slow that they think I've finished talking, but no one seems to really care about my day even though I'm constantly asked about it.

As for niceness, my take-away from my time here is that Bulgarians are much closer to their neighbors/coworkers, while Americans are much nicer when it comes to complete strangers.

As for the two being closer socially, I think it'd be nice for Americans to be less crazy about scheduling everything. I can't speak about Europe in general, but here in Bulgaria, people can show up on my doorstep without invitation and bam - three hour of chatting, football on TV, and hard liquor. But it'd be nice for Bulgarians to understand that when something *is* actually scheduled, it's not okay to run late and keep people waiting - and that when late, it's polite to at least call, because it's unexpected (though now, after two years here, it's become expected).",0,1337955077,null,0,false,0,c4s8cew,t3_u3wp1,t1_c4s8cew,t1_c4s64sp,null,1428998109,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

This amount isn't a loan, official or unofficial. It's a reduction of some of Greece's debt, held by private bondholders, via a bond swap with these people/institutions. It's not a matter of how person X or newspaper Y wants to ""count"" it. What happened is perfectly clear, the details are found in my previous comment.

No, I agree with jailing politicians who abuse their powers and falsify important government papers for their gain. Timoshenko is jailed because she has falsified the government decision.

&gt; I don't see how you can really justify saying this. She made an agreement with Russia which got the gas turned back on, solved the crisis, removed the bill which Gazprom were trying to force upon Ukraine, and gave a 1 year discount before a price rise to market rates.

Well, the trick is that according to this gas deals Ukraine now pays around $500 per 1000 m³. It is now cheaper for Ukraine to purchase russian gas from Germans! There was another trick: the take-or-pay clause. Ukraine had to purhcase around 50 billions m³ of gas each year or pay 300% of the unused quota.

Now, when the prises rise as they do in this case the demand shrinks. Instead of buying 50 billions Ukraine now buys not more than 10 billions m³. You can do the math to see that this was not an ordinary commercial deal. It was a complete and total capitulation of Ukraine. Ukrainian industry had to go broke in several years and purchased by Gazprom thugs for cheap.

[More info here](http://ukr-nationalism.livejournal.com/1790033.html).

&gt; Yanukovych is the man in power, and he's hardly pro-west.

He is extremely hardly pro-Russian as well. If you look beyond fairy tales mass-media tell about Ukraine, then you can notice that under his rule Ukraine implemented unprecedented number of very important reforms required to get closer to the European Union.

Ukraine under his rule implements very rapid measures to change balance of power in the region and, what is more important: *diversify sources of energy*.

Personally, I think we should run a 'Let Scotland remain in the UK' referendum in England / Wales / N Ireland at the same time as the Scottish one.

Edit: I should clarify as to why. An opinion that I'm starting to regularly see, and I share in some aspects, is resentment towards Scotland. They seem to the casual observer to have everything better than England. Better NHS. Lower / non-existent tuition fees (as compared to south of the border, with rates of up to £12,000 a year and climbing), better public transport, etc etc. And due to the West Lothian question, Scottish ministers (and Welsh and N Irish, but that's beside the point) can vote on English matters while we can't vote on theirs.

In times of economic struggle, people will dig in history to find excuses for everything. Sarrazin tries this; the Kosovarians blame in Osmanic invasion, the Greeks blame the German invasion for their misery.

It is true though that the feeling of guilt for WW2 and the Nazi crimes is still a big driving force in German politics. Maybe most german politicians nowadays over-emphasize the role of the EU and the € for keeping peace. They think that Germany should not take more leadership in the EU. They are willing to sacrifice German interests to please France, because the French-German friendship is considered very important.

Some german politicians think that their neighbours will forget about the war and the Holocaust just if Germany continues to be the paymaster. This will of course never happen, because this crimes will and may never be forgotten. This issue will only be solved when there is a new generation of politicians with international experience who know that the Germans are no Nazis anymore and whose German counterparts know that Germany has become a respected and liked country.

EBU is a club for national public broadcasters. The broadcasters pay money to be part of EBU, for EuroNews and whatnot. The song contest is just one more thing on that bunch, open for all paying members. 

Azerbaijan has paid the membership fees for 20 years, you can't really kick them out for winning a song contest.. and wanting the big prize for it.

&gt;EBU should have certain criteria for entering the Eurovision Song Contest, and one of them should be that a participating country must be able to guarantee the safety of all participants from all countries, regardless of sexuality, religion or nationality.

I've yet to hear of a piece of news where any Eurovision visitor to Baku would have had bodily ill happen to him due to religious or political reasons, so on that front Azerbaijan is doing very well indeed.

&gt;That would probably rule out all the sad little back-alley countries that are incapable of or unwilling to get with the fucking program.
And lose EBU half the countries paying its membership fees.

I really sympathise, I do. But Eurovision Song Contest isn't the Olympics, the Ice Hockey or Soccer Championships where the host country bid against other countries promising special laws and a lot of money (also in bribes). The host country only has to have a public broadcaster and the winner of the last year's competition. Nothing less, nothing more.

It's basically a careful evaluation of the costs of a (controlled) Eurozone breakup, concluding those costs are too high, and further concluding that deeper integration is preferable, even if only grudgingly so, because of the inherent dangers of a European superstate.

Finally, two instruments are suggested: stronger Eurowide bank control by a single regulator, and a limited mutualisation of European debt (with a strong emphasis on 'limited'). This being the Economist (which I have quite a bit of respect for, by the way), and not, say, the Guardian, the details of those two suggestions and their motivations are comparably moderate, in an editorial tradition that I propose calling  ""enlightened Euroscepticism"" :-)

Here's my question: I've argued against Eurobonds in the past, but I'm also trying to stay open-minded about the possibility of a **limited** mutualisation of European debt. To me, that's obviously a more defensible demand than unconditional Eurobonds. But I personally don't entirely catch the details yet: the idea seems to be to mutualize the debt **above** some percentage, floating around seems to be ""60%"". But is there some mechanism that prevents countries from simply racking up higher debts in the future, on top of the current debt (since ""above 60%"" doesn't include an upper limit)? Or is the idea to buy, in one big sweep, the **current** and **only** the current debt above 60%, in which case countries that (hypothetically) continue overspending won't be protected by further mutualization?

Yeah, that would work well. Things like that can easily backfire if something unforeseen happens. They did their best.

&gt;Yes, but ""pulling strings"" (i.e. exercising corruption) is not an official security guarantee, and foreign ministries in Europe still discourage gay citizens to travel there for the competition.

Even the interviewed activist grudgingly said that the president did his best on this one. One would think that in places like Azerbaijan the president ""pulling strings"" and something being ""official"" has very little difference in people's minds. You might think different. The locals, even the president's enemies, seem to think otherwise.

&gt;Yes, that's the main point of it. But it kind of ruins the fun when half your fan base is brutally beaten up, or when people's basic human rights are violated. So let's just ignore it? Bullshit.

We aren't ignoring the human rights. After all, reporters are doing documentaries, the problems are highlighted, the fact that we are having this discussion and talking about corruption and how this week is so very special for homosexuals not being beaten up, should tell you something.

I don't actually think that the Eurovision Song Contest is a primary source of information about life in Western Europe, even in Azerbajdjan. ;-)

&gt; They go to internet and read about Azerbaijan as seen by foreigners. And they think; ""that isn't us; that shouldn't be us"".

Anyway, we actually agree about the importance of focusing on these issues.

The difference maybe is in things like street signs and such, which are mainly in Catalan in Barcelona, but they're similar enough languages to understand most of each other when written (pronunciation is a different matter, however). 

Around one third to one half of the people of Barcelona use Spanish exclusively as their everyday language ([link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Miracle#Rural_exodus)^1 ), and the rest speak Spanish just as well too, so there is no absolute must to learn Catalan either.

^1 : the link does not explain it fully: during the sixties there was an exodus from more rural areas like andalusia and extremadura to more urbanized areas like Madrid, Bilbao or Barcelona. The economic reason being obvious, the Franco dictatorship also wanted to quell the resistance of Catalan and Basque people to fully embrace Spanish language and tradition. It was a half-half victory, the struggle continues nowadays with catalan nationalists who want to restore catalan traditions while centralists want them not to resist spanish (castilian and andalusian mainly) traditions. The former are slowly advancing their goals and the latter are noisier everyday. Recently bullfighting was completely banned in Barcelona (and if someone thinks that's killing culture they should see with their eyes how an innocent animal is tortured and almost bleeded to death before the coup-de-grace).

It's not up to me, it's up to the opinion of a majority of the Scottish people (though, whether a majority of voters is needed, or a minimum amount of the electorate, like 1979, this time will be debated hotly). 

Personally, I would rather there was just increased devolution. Seperating the debts (not just sovereign debt, but the bailed out bank of Scotland liabilities), the nuclear deterrent (based in Scotland), the military (Scotland will want bits of it, and future naval contracts) and the public sector in general would be an absolute nightmare of bitter recriminations.

Edit: Oh and the other big argument will be the maritime border. Scottish nationalists believe that the 1999 change to make the maritime border perpendicular along the coast instead of on the 55 degrees line of latitude (as was decided in the 60s) was a plot to rob them of fishing and oil in the event of independence.

If the Scottish people want independence then that is up to the Scottish people and England has no say in this - England taking a vote to kick Scotland out is not what I am talking about and, indeed, would be ridiculous. In fact I think we are on the same page here, because you correctly state that if England wants independence we should elect a party that has that as its goal - my question is, why is this not more of a mainstream issue within English politics? And, to be clear, I aim my question at my fellow English, not at the Scots. I completely support Scotland's right to a referendum on their independence and we in England should not get a say in that. We can however have a say in our own national independence or devolution, and I hope that this will become an area for intelligent debate within mainstream politics. 

The West Lothian question is entirely an issue for Westminster, and the fact that it has remained undealt with for so long is to me an indicator of the general apathy amongst the English electorate towards the matter. This was really the point I was trying to make in my initial post - as an Englishman I am frustrated that despite the fact that there is clearly a very lively and passionate debate about Scottish independence and national identity going on in Scotland, it has not sparked a similar debate here in England about our national identity. 

Personally, I am not pro-independence for England. However, I can understand why Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may vote for independence at some point in my lifetime. Thus independence may be forced upon us, and I think now would be a good time for us to start seriously considering this issue.

the first is pretty obvious, clubs have loud banging music to dance and pubs mostly dark areas with seats to hang out. most clubs have those areas as well.

botellón (the big bottle may be a rough translation) is buying alcohol and soft drinks from cheap establishments (alcohol is not limited to liquour stores and bars, you can buy it from any general store or supermarket) and mixing them, then share between the ones who paid. It's usually done while hanging out on the street (which causes lots of problems for neighbors, so most places are banning it except dedicated areas) and before going into the club, mostly to save money (around 3€ for two drinks, well below 8€ that would cost at the club)

daytime parties are scarce, unless you know some rich boy whose father owns an apartment near the sea or a yacht. usually people just go to the beach and hang around bars having a snack (vermut they call it sometimes, from the Vermouth drink.

there are also local festivities in many towns around summer, there you can find concert parties and such, but they're usually 3-6 days each place. The ""Festa Major"" of Barcelona is the 24th of September though (La Mercè)

there are also privately organized parties at clubs that accept paid entrance (around 10€ with a drink), mostly they overlap with normal club activity I think. Never been to any of these, they do many of them in Ibiza.

And well, there are normal concerts at places like razzmatazz and drinking pubs of diverse themes (heavy metal and such)

Scotland is about 10% of the population, leaving about the same GDP per capita still.

Yet Canada's population is treated better in most categories than the US.

Presumably, yes. They have no problem with an open UK border, so I don't see why a Schegen Area-type border would be a problem.

I'll go in the following order: clarifications, what won't change, and what will change.

*To clarify:* I am making up the term ""Canadian model."" When one says, ""Nordic model"" they cannot just be talking about Norway, Sweden, and Finland's social policies, because those social policies are informed by the geographic and domestic make up of those nations. If you want to say, ""Scotland will have a better social democracy!"" say that, don't say, ""Nordic model"" because the nordic model is only possible because of these states' geographic location.

I say Canadian model because the Canadian social welfare system is a very well-developed system, but it is informed by the nation's subservience to the US economy, just as any Scottish nation's welfare system *would have to be*.

*To clarify more*: Scotland and England, because they have such a huge economic disparity in size, cannot share the same currency for the same reason that the Euro should not exist: there can be no fiscal union without monetary union. Any ""Bank of Britain"" will always, always, always care more about England then Scotland, just like the ECB cares more about Germany. This will, someday, *fuck the Scots up*. If they have their own currency, it'll be all fine and dandy, in this regard after Britannia's internal trade slows down a wee bit.

*What will not change*: Scotland will still participate in America's ""adventure's"" as Europeans call them. Its foreign policy will still be, more or less, dictated by Washington, or, perhaps worse, London or Brussels. It will not get the oil that it so desire, and what it does get will not be as big a benefit as they think it is .

*What will change*: They get their own team at the Olympics. *They will lose 11 billion dollars a year.

Just a quick calculation:

&gt;From http://www.oilofscotland.org/: The UK Union costs Scotland £34.5 million a day (from not being able to keep oil)

&gt;From [The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/3644010/The-Union-of-England-and-Scotland-is-over.html): At least £11 billion of English money heads for Edinburgh each year,


A quick calculation shows you that there is *very little* change in Scottish revenue because of independence.


**I'm going to repost the following section so it isn't junked by my first, rather crass, comment.**

What us Americans have to understand is that the Scottish issue is a case of emotions and emotions alone. When you do the economic math, it generally sides towards Union, but *that doesn't take in account the emotional baggage*. This emotional baggage, this historical, cultural, familial little-brothership weighs heavily on the Scots. England gets to claim it was part of the Roman Empire, that it has London, that it was *literally* the center of the civilized world. Scotland gets to say that it was a land of barbarians who got adopted. In the United States, we don't have to deal with this historical baggage. The biggest weight on our national historical consciousness is the Civil War (as seen through racism and the permanently underclassed Southern states)... *that was only 150 years ago* but the Scottish-English feud goes back centuries more. If I were a Scott, and I found it absolutely impossible to feel proud about bring British, like the loudest Scotts are, then I'd probably have a longing for independence, too. I'd have a longing to say, after a decade or two, ""Who said so!"" after the Scottish Empire recolonizes India and destroys Neo-Hitler.



The Economist says this, and I think this is the perfect answer:

&gt; ""If Scots really want independence for political or cultural reasons, they should go for it. National pride is impossible to price. But if they vote for independence they should do so in the knowledge that their country could end up as one of Europe’s vulnerable, marginal economies.""

England gets to claim it was part of the Roman Empire, that it has London, that it was *literally* the center of the civilized world. Scotland gets to say that it was a land of barbarians who got adopted. In the United States, we don't have to deal with this historical baggage. The biggest weight on our national historical consciousness is the Civil War (as seen through racism and the permanently underclassed Southern states)... *that was only 150 years ago* but the Scottish-English feud goes back centuries more. If I were a Scott, and I found it absolutely impossible to feel proud about bring British, like the loudest Scotts are, then I'd probably have a longing for independence, too. I'd have a longing to say, after a decade or two, ""Who said so!"" after the Scottish Empire recolonizes India and destroys Neo-Hitler.



The Economist says this, and I think this is the perfect answer:

&gt; ""If Scots really want independence for political or cultural reasons, they should go for it. National pride is impossible to price. But if they vote for independence they should do so in the knowledge that their country could end up as one of Europe’s vulnerable, marginal economies.""

**tl;dr: Its emotions, stupid (which make you, any non-British person, ineligible to truly answer).**

I've never been to New York but I don't imagine that it's terribly different from Paris in *some* ways.

But yes, if you learn no other French before you go on your trip, learn to say ""hello"" and ""thank you"" (which you probably already know) and ""do you speak English?"" in French.

Also if you are good at charades and have an open mind and sense of humor, that always helps.  Lol.  There was a bakery down the street that had these wonderful little creations called mini beignets that were filled with jelly, chocolate, or creme... and I don't think the lady spoke a bit of english.  The first few mornings after this discovery were interesting.  Five of us, half awake and freezing cold, slinking in and almost having to play charades with her to communicate what we wanted... it was hilarious!  She seemed to think it was pretty funny too.  After a few times it went a lot smoother b/c she remembered us and our orders.

Everyone we came into contact with was either very nice and helpful once you had greeted them in French, or just business like as you find in places in the US too.  But never rude or anything like that.

Our country is not built on letting the misfortunate die, thanks for twisting that. We were built on limited government where the states have power too. But now, they twist the elestic clause, and in this case, the interstate commerce clause to get us to do whatever they want. Soon, they will claim that babies are interstate commerce because the heart monitor came from another state, and then they will be able to control something so basic to human life, and so personal that no one ever wishes the government ever got its fingers into. And NO I do not believe that will actually happen. That's just a direction we could take. Reddit itself posted today ""Drones over US being armed with weapons today.""

I'm no conspiracy theorist. The only reason we aren't further down government control is because if they go slowly, we won't fight back.

true,mojojo42,SCOT,Scotland,"I don't really think it's the business of the English either - that is what independence means after all. Ireland or the US hardly required the UK's permission before becoming independent, and it's not something that is ""granted"".

Negotiating how independence is implemented will obviously require a discussion between Scotland and the UK (England, Wales, and Northern Ireland - not just England!).

There will be no nationalism or terrorism in Northern Ireland as a result. Scottish independence is about economic and political control, not about the kind of suppression that Éire experienced (which is not to justify terrorism, simply to say that has never been a factor in Scottish politics).

Scotland does have the infrastructure for independence. From outside the UK it's not always obvious, however the Scottish and English/Welsh/NI legal systems are (and always have been) different. This has had an impact on a whole range of things: the police and criminal justice systems are separate, the health service is separate, the government is separate, etc.

In general things are harmonised to make sure that we do function pretty much in parallel, but there are a large number of differences between them. E.g., Scotland introduced a smoking ban a year before England and is about to introduce a minimum price for alcohol. In Scotland a conviction requires two or more pieces of corroborating evidence, in England and Wales this is not the case. In Scotland medical prescriptions are free, in England they are not.

The current system is the Scottish government has control over many aspects of running Scotland, but does not have the power to collect taxes (all taxes are sent to the UK, who then decide what %ge to release back to the Scottish government to spend).

true,mojojo42,SCOT,Scotland,"Most people believe that Scotland would not need to re-apply to the EU; like the rUK (rest-of-UK), they would inherit the UK's current status. There is no real mechanism within the EU for a member state to split into two member states, but it's clear it would be beneficial to all three parties (Scotland, rUK, and the EU) so I am pretty sure a way would be found (there certainly is no appetite within Scotland to leave the EU - Scotland is much less Eurosceptic than parts of England).

The SNP (current Scottish government, the main pro-independence party) were originally (pre-crisis) in favour of joining the Eurozone. However their current policy is that we would continue to use the pound, and only consider the Euro if it made sense.

Practically speaking that means using the pound until such time as the rUK decide to switch to the Euro - there is an enormous amount of cross-border trade between Scotland and rUK, so keeping on the same currency as them probably makes more sense (there's a lot of trade with the Eurozone too of course, but having to carry two currencies in your wallet when taking the train somewhere wouldn't be a popular choice).

Scotland would remain inside the [Common Travel Area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Travel_Area), and would not join Schengen. Again primarily to ease the process - if we joined Schengen then we'd need to set up passport controls at the border with England, which is simply unnecessary (although this is a favourite scare story of the right-wing UK media).

The impact on UK politics would be significant in the short term, but these things come and go.

The military is probably the trickiest to split but it's hardly impossible - some assets will become Scottish, most won't, and there will be a negotiation to determine what makes sense for both countries.

That negotiation will involve a bit of give-and-take on both sides. Removing nuclear weapons from Scotland is a long-standing SNP policy (and one that has a lot of sympathy beyond the SNP), but obviously they can't be moved until there's somewhere to move them to. So some kind of long-term leasing arrangement will be needed whereby Faslane is rented to the rUK.

Separating debts is not as hard as you think - there may be some that are considered ""national"" debts rather than UK-wide, however probably not that many (the problem with saying ""Bank of Scotland has Scotland in the name so you get that debt"" is trying to back-date all the revenue that BoS paid to the treasury: if historical debt is split up based on a name, so should assets surely). The ones that are UK-wide can be split per-capita, per-GDP, traded off against something else (Scotland promises not to lease Faslane to China if rUK promises to do something else in return), etc.

I don't think this is the case at all. America has a particularly romantic view of Scottish independence (e.g., Braveheart), but that really doesn't match the current debate on independence.

Independence is much more about continuing the process of devolution. Scotland has had a separate government since 1999, and in general people think it works well. However that government is limited in its powers, particularly so economically.

There are also major differences in direction between the two governments - Scotland currently generates 35% of its electricity from renewables and has a target of 100% for 2020. The UK target for 2020 is 15%. Scotland introduced a smoking ban a year before the rest of the UK, and looks set to introduce minimum alcohol pricing first too. Medical prescriptions are free in Scotland but not in England, etc.

The Economist article was a bit of a hatchet job IMO (the insulting magazine cover didn't help), as you could easily rewrite that as ""their country could end up as one of Europe's newest, most exciting economies"" (we contribute slightly more to the UK in revenue than we receive in expenditure, but there's a persistent myth in the UK that Scotland is somehow subsidised by the rest of the UK).

Yes, we need reforms to separate investment banking from the traditional banking, and to make sure banks don't get ""too big to fail"". But this wouldn't have prevented this. Putting money into (supposedly) secure government bonds is the opposite of high-risk, high gain speculation. Greek ten-year bonds between when they joined the Eurozone and 2007 on average yielded only 0.27% more than German ones, so they barely beat inflation.   
What banks (traditionally) do is to take an aggregate of many small short term deposits and turn them into long term credit.

I think in general they would prefer us inside: there's no reason to lose an existing trading partner and some countries may enjoy tweaking rUK's nose after the recent boycott of the Eurozone rescue plan. As such I think a way would be found.

The other side of it is what would happen to the rUK? The UK entered the EU as a union of four countries (Scotland, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland), so if you remove one of those countries is the UK still the UK? Should it inherit the same relationship to the EU, even though that relationship was entered into in combination with a country that's no longer part of it?

I don't think anyone would seriously propose making the rUK re-apply for membership, and I think Scotland would be treated the same way. At least in the short term, allowing Scotland some of the flexibility that the UK has had over issues like the Eurozone would go a long way to helping Scotland participate in the EU (as, in the long term, Scotland is perhaps more likely to be a ""good EU citizen"" than the UK - the EU is widely seen as a force for good here).

Dutch is closely related to German and English and is said to be between them. Apart from not having undergone the High German consonant shift, Dutch—like English—has mostly abandoned the grammatical case system, is relatively unaffected by the Germanic umlaut, and has levelled much of its morphology. Dutch historically has three grammatical genders, but this distinction has far fewer grammatical consequences than in German. Dutch shares with German the use of subject–verb–object word order in main clauses and subject–object–verb in subordinate clauses. Dutch vocabulary is mostly Germanic and contains the same Germanic core as German and English, while incorporating more Romance loans than German and fewer than English.



also, as a native german speaker, I can confirm this.
I don't speak any dutch, but I can understand many words (not only nouns, also verbs), but I have to concentrate very much on the speaker.

Ciò che avevo scritto è ancora attuale, con l'unica aggiunta che il Parlamento Europeo deciderà se ratificare o no l'ACTA fra il 3 e il 5 luglio, mentre dal 31 maggio prossimo in poi le commissioni del Parlamento Europeo decideranno se approvare i rapporti proposti.

Contro l'ACTA, la cosa migliore da fare è scrivere una lettera o una mail al proprio europarlamentare.

Quanto al CISPA, è [un disegno di legge americano](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr3523rfs/pdf/BILLS-112hr3523rfs.pdf) [PDF] che permetterebbe la creazione di una rete fra governo e compagnie private (p.es. gli ISP) per l'adozione di misure cautelative e per lo scambio di informazioni allo scopo di sconfiggere il cybercrimine (dove per ""cybercrimine"" s'intende in sostanza quanto descritto [in questo atto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act)). Ora, quale sia il limite di queste ""misure"", quanto personali siano queste ""informazioni"" e chi siano queste compagnie, non è molto chiaro, ed è questo che preoccupa molti.

Da quel che ho capito, il CISPA potrebbe danneggiare anche noi europei a seconda di come viene interpretato il testo. Posso preoccuparmi, per esempio, se per connettermi a Wikileaks il mio segnale passa per un server americano; se poi anche i fornitori di servizi Internet vengono coinvolti (leggi: Google, Facebook, Reddit), la situazione si fa più grave.

I'm from Sweden, my girlfriend is from Poland, we're paid in pounds but have some expenses in zloty and kronor, my employer is an American company, my work is primarily in the German market... the potential impacts of switching to the euro, staying with the pound or going with some other option are considerable and hard to predict.

In general terms I think Scotland could benefit from self-determination and that there is nothing wrong with an EU consisting of many small countries rather than a few large countries. However, there will always be a large degree of uncertainty about a change like this so it may be a safer choice to remain part of the UK.

Also for those who see the world through the lens of the realist model (where the international is in a state of anarchy) there is an obvious advantage to being a large nation with strong armed forces and nuclear weapons. 

This strikes me as somewhat short-sighted though, as an anti-EU UK of 62m will have far less influence on the world stage in decades to come than the far larger EU. Additionally we've already been down the road of strong nation states and seen Europe devastated repeatedly.

For others, seeing perhaps a constructivist or liberal world order, size and strength becomes less relevant as international interactions take place in a framework of rivalry (such as marketplace competition) or amity (such as pooling of sovereignty for absolute gains without concern about relative gains) rather than enmity. This renders military strength increasingly irrelevant and a burden due to the incredible cost of modern weapon systems.

In this context the Scandinavian model is perhaps more relevant. As small countries they have focused on generous international aid to build goodwill rather than carry a big stick in US or Russian style. There is a lot of cultural affinity between the Scandinavian countries and Scotland, although there are also notable differences.

edit: this sounded a little bit harsh. what I was trying to say is that the experience of the unification has to be analyzed properly, and France and the south should understand this. for example privatization was one reason for the deindustrialization of east germany. furthermore, spending alone will never create economic activity, and in the worst case only maintains broken business models, as we can see in the German Ruhr area with its heavily subsized coal mining.

From what I know from my Greek friends is that they all want the country to change the structures, to make government more efficient. But without any perspective, they will likely not be able to work on these reforms.

true,amelin,null,null,"I had a look again at the [yes site](http://www.yesscotland.net/ten_things), these are their ten facts to support the case for independence:

- Being independent means that the people of Scotland will be in charge of Scotland’s future. Together, we care most about our nation, so nobody else is going to do as good a job of making Scotland a success. 
- If Scotland votes yes, the first independent parliament will be elected in 2016 – we will get the government we vote for, unlike today, with a government in London the majority of voters in Scotland did not support. 
- Scotland more than pays her way in the UK. We get 9.3% of UK spending, but contribute 9.6% of UK taxes. We are in a stronger financial position than the rest of the UK, to the tune of £510 per person last year - that's over £1000 for each Scottish household. As an independent country, this money would stay in Scotland.
- Scotland already pays for all the government services we need as an independent country - we don't have to start from scratch. However, the money will be spent in Scotland, rather than London, creating thousands of Scottish jobs.
- With independence we'll save on some UK spending - so the initial start up costs will be met by the £250 million annual saving from the UK's existing nuclear weapons and the £50 million annual saving by no longer paying for politicians at Westminster.
- Scotland would remain part of the EU. EU law doesn't allow for Scotland to be unilaterally kicked out on independence. And, EU law also makes clear that Scotland can't be forced to join the euro. We will continue to use the pound, just as we do today.
- Scotland has 25% of the EU's offshore wind and tidal energy potential. By 2020 our renewable energy could be generating £2 billion a year of exports and by 2050 our renewable energy could be worth £14 billion a year.
- Scotland doesn't need oil to become independent, but our oil and gas resource is worth over £1 trillion and gives us a safety net for the future. Last year saw record investment in the North Sea and in October, BP said they expected North Sea oil and gas to flow for at least another 40 years.
- The UK government doesn't include oil and gas when it talks about Scotland's finances. But, if you do include oil and gas in our national accounts, we would be the 6th wealthiest nation per capita in developed world.

same goes actually for many English words of germanic origin - so if you have 
house (E), huis (D), Haus (G), then also mouse (E), muis, Maus (G). However 
English has had quite some more changes and in particularly many more words of non-germanic origin, so this sort of tricks get you much further from Dutch to 
German, where you can quite often guess what the German word is if you know the Dutch one. Mind you this probably only works if you already have quite an extensive vocabulary in Dutch. This sort of guesswork leads to a lot of Dutch people attempting to speak German and making a right mess of it - as quite often the guess is wrong, 
or has a subtly different meaning.

Now for grammar, German is a bit more complicated in terms of declension, i.e. words changing due to function in the sentence (subject, direct object, indirect object, depending on pronoun) - which Dutch doesn't do - and gender. In Dutch there's only two genders to worry about (""de"" and ""het"" words for common and neutral gender) whereas German has three: Masculine, Feminine and Neutral. One trick is that most words that are neutral in Dutch are neutral in German as well (het boek, das Buch). Another trick that comes to mind is that usually when Dutch uses the verb ""zijn"" to form the perfect tense, it is the same in German (same as in Dutch the perfect is formed with either ""to be"" or ""to have"" as an auxillary verb).

However there are also a lot of areas where we differ: Scotland has long-standing problems with public health, excessive drinking, and chronic unemployment.

true,mojojo42,SCOT,Scotland,"I think there will be a lot of noise in the media, but I don't think any serious politician would act on it (i.e., there will be no punitive legislation created by rUK to ""punish"" Scotland).

I don't know what EU legislation you have been reading, but it is my understanding that while there is no fast track (new states must meet the criteria and enter the Eurozone), similarly there is no precedent (no existing member state has split into two before).

As such this is a new situation, and may require a new solution. Given the unique measures being drawn up to handle Greece, I don't think it would be beyond the EU to come up with a solution here either.

It's in the interests of Scotland/rUK/EU that Scotland be engaged with the EU within it, rather than outside it, and the simplest way for that to happen is for both Scotland and rUK to ""join"" as some kind of ""derived state"" rather than the full-blown application process.

""The English"" (surely the rUK?) do not have a veto over Scotland joining. In fact I do wonder if someone will raise the issue of the UK's current relationship to the EU - should the rUK have the same relationship as the UK does, given that one of the countries which helped form that relationship is no longer part of the UK?

It's an interesting thought experiment. If, one day, Wales and NI also became independent (Wales possibly, NI exceedingly unlikely I'd have thought) then would the UK simply be England? Does England get to inherit all of the UK's current relationships?

Spain has explicitly stated that they are not concerned about Scotland acting as a precedent. The [Spanish Foreign Minister](http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/304495) has said that ""Spain would have nothing to say, just that this does not affect us.

The problem is really from the Euro itself. The 'major institutions' basically tricked the German public into thinking that they could have a currency union without a fiscal union.

I read the Maastricht Treaty in full, it was long, and long ago, and it was life-changingly boring, but the criteria for accession were set in stone, and there was no quick way through it.  Even with Scotland's guaranteed passing of the acquis due to the incorporation of Scottish/UK/EU law, it still has to undergo the full accession process.

Anyone who tells you otherwise without showing you a letter from the European Commission highlighting the passage of text showing how that Scotland doesn't have to re-apply, is thinking very wishfully, at best.  

The EU countires with historical separatist movements don't have to veto anything these days, Scotland has no instant right to EU membership, because nobody ever wrote any such facility into any EU treaty, because the countries with seperatist movements had civil servants, who were vigilant against letting such things into EU law.

I'm English but I don't want Scotland to leave the Union because it seems a backward step on the path to a United Federation of Planets but I'm not emotionally vested either way, but I don't think the Scottish public is being given the full picture of quite how difficult the technocratic side of creating a brand new political and legal national indentity will be",0,1338048543,null,0,1338049792,0,c4smbmz,t3_u4ub8,t1_c4smbmz,t1_c4slqgs,null,1429004820,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

As I said above, I do not think Scotland would automatically retain official membership immediately, as negotiations would have to take place as to what the relationship of Scotland and the EU would be.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I know a lot of former Stasi-Members, from Wachregiment Feliks Dzierzynski to Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung. Of course the differ in how they behaved according to their unit. The Wachregiment was more or less a military part (guard bataillon) and mot people there behaved like normal soldiers. Some of my Judo coaches where sergeants in the WRFD, one was for some time a bodyguard of Margot Honecker in Berlin and Wandlitz. 

HVA-People and those guiding IMs where trained to behave like normal people, they should not draw any attention to them. 

If you want to sound somewhat realistic, have a look at the following video: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BishkLwWTnE
a teaching movie from the MfS about an so called ""operativer Vorgang"", which is just the official name for a case to investigate. 

If you need some specific terms, look them up on 
http://www.ddrlexikon.de/
or http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprachgebrauch_in_der_DDR

But don't exaggerate their use. 

If you want to see East German police officers, watch some Polizeiruf 110 on Youtube, but make sure they are from 1989 or earlier. Polizeiruf was the only crime investigation series in the GDR and features several officers who solve a case per episode. The series pretty much shows how the government wanted to see their own police officers. 

For the Stasi-Agents: some times people where interrogated by Stasi officers and they did not know they where Stasis. They often used official legends of being police officers (or regular army officers when the border patrol or army was involved). So it was completely normal for some to be under surveillance by Stasi without knowing until they read there files in the stasi-archive. 

My mother was allowed to travel to West Germany in 1987 to visit her uncles and aunts. My Granfather - her father - was born in west germany and met my Grandma during WW2 so he settled down in what later would become East Germany after being released from PoW. 

In the 1990s my Mom read her files in the stasi archive and she was shocked to see how many of her co-workers worked as IM for Stasi and sold little ""secrets"" to their officers. 
My dad also got into some minor trouble during his tour of duty in the East German army in the mid 1970s. He often smuggled in some Beer or Schnaps in his army truck and sometimes got caught. Later he learned that he was interrogated by Stasi officers, not only plain vanilla army officers. And he was really frightened when he learned that, because of the army prison in Schwedt. 


If you want more hints or some tips, I need more context. Especially if the agents act openly as stasi, why are you beeing arrested, which period of GDR are we talking about and so on.

On the other hand, Greece and Germany are completely different nations: they have little shared history, culture or language, and thus they cannot relate to each other very well. Therefore, Germans find it difficult to spend similar amounts of money to help out the people of Greece.

This faliure to relate is the key problem with the eurozone and indeed with the whole idea of a united Europe. Monetary union works elsewhere, such as in the US, because people in one part of the country are willing the help out people in another part. Even in India, a land of 300 individual languages, monetary union works, since there is a common culture and a common history. Why? Because they share all these things that Europe simply does not.

This dual education system supplies the *Mittelstand* with the required well trained workforce.  Additionally, those countries using the dual education system (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Netherlands and so on) have usually a very low unemployment rate among young people (age 16-25).

Many countries are interested in that system, for example I have been training Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai vocational teachers in an UN project to establish dual education system vocational schools in south east asia. But it cannot be simply transfered to another country and different culture.

In Greece they cut government spending very hard, for example pensions were sometimes halved and public sector pay was cut. This decreased people's spending in a very large sector, which was bad for the recovering economy. Further the Greek government did NOT reduce the tax burden, they added new corporate taxes while raising existing ones, they raised VAT and added new luxury taxes. This then decreased spending even more. So everything becomes more expensive while people continually have less to spend, so how does this help the economy?

These measures were a requirement for getting new loans for the Greek government. And to make matters worse, AFTER Greece got these loans their rating was reduced (because they loaned so much), which increased interest on these loans. This put them in a position were their governments income was continually decreasing while suddenly having a lot more expenses. So now they have put themselves, or have been put, in a situation where they cannot get out by themselves (without causing even more damage to the economy).

I do agree with your idea of an EU-of-small-countries. Obviously France/Germany/rUK will continue to dominate as today, but I would like to see Scotland be present as 1 voice among 28 rather than 8% of 1 voice among 27.

The counter to the strong state argument is that the UK has been closely tied to the US militarily for some time now. That is as much political as anything else, but the Iraq war was deeply unpopular in Scotland (and in the rest of the UK, to be sure). As such an independent Scotland may have participated in the early stages, as many countries did, but would not have had the means (nor the desire) to get sucked into the quagmire with the UK/US.

Nuclear weapons are not very popular in Scotland - the cost a lot of money, and who are we seriously going to fire them at? The fact that all of the UK's weapons were placed in Scotland is a bit annoying, although that is largely geographical (access to the deep ocean) than out of spite (poll tax).

Greater participation in the EU would benefit both Scotland our neighbours (including rUK) I think, and I think ""losing"" Scotland would force rUK to go through a period of introspection and hopefully decide to engage more with the rest of Europe.

In terms of your last point, ""any other region"", there is something to be said for giving regions self-government. However Scotland is not a region, it is a country (Sweden did not become a region when it joined the EU, it's still Sweden - similarly with Scotland and the UK).

The important thing to remember is that you are not voting for the specifics of how independence is implemented - that is for future UK and Scottish governments to decide, and parties will need to make their case to the voters as to which implementation is best.

true,Vespasianus,NETH,The Netherlands,"I will go so far as to say yes, this is the best era ever to exist. 

I'm living in the states till august and people here frequently gripe about how much better life was in the 1950s. You could support your whole family on a factory job and the wife could stay at home bla bla bla. 

Yes it was great, if you were a heterosexual white male in a western country.

______

Now I shall address your other points:

&gt;*Are we better off with mobile telephones and smartphones, with which we're reachable 24/7 by anyone and anywhere.*
 
**YES**. You are not reachable by anyone and by no means anywhere. You have the choice to decline to communicate with someone. In fact you can choose not to own one altogether like my S.O. (to my eternal frustration). I use my mobile devices extensively. I have a tablet I carry with me to work with 50-or-so medical reference books and drug formularies. It will automatically alert me to drug interactions, give me treatment options for diseases and allow me to finish my discharge/surgical notes wherever I am.

How would I have done this in the past? I would have spent 1000s of hours looking for patient charts, drug formularies and internal med references (which may well have been out of date) and my hand would be cramped constantly by writing (likely illegible) notes. 

My phone gives similar benefits plus a GPS. I went to uni in Brussels (IMHO one of the least navigable cities to ever exist) and a GPS would have made my life remarkably easier. 

I won't prattle on on this. The point is, mobile phones are a luxury you can choose to live with or without.

______

&gt;*Are we better off in a world where we have to arrange seeing friends well in advance, because no one has time and it's culturally no longer allowed to just drop in.*

In the Netherlands it has always been kind of rude to just show up at someone's door. Now I can send an SMS to my friend if I'm nearby instead of possibly interrupting her whilst she's doing something.

_____

&gt;*Are we better off than our parents, in a time where we can communicate online and have the internet, but the system is also (ab)used by megacorps and banks to suck more value out of it.*

Before banks and mega-corporations exploiting the world there were colonial powers (*you and I both belong to them, and on the GOOD end of it I might add*). Before that there were dukes, counts, princes, kings, emperors and warlords. Mega-corporations may be annoying but this has always existed and likely always will.

______

&gt; *Are we better in a time where affordable housing is becoming more utopic if you don't inherit it and commute times for an ever increasing part of the population reaches over 2hrs daily (I did 3h30 a day for a while, it blows), a time where in ever more families no parent has enough time for their child etc.*

You seem to be under the impression that this was not the case in the past. People in farm villages still had to bring their goods to market. People in cities still had to go to their jobs. When I was in secondary school I used to bike 15km each way and thought nothing of it. My current commute (via train) is 45 minutes. It's not necessarily better or worse now overall but I will add that it's likely more comfortable (imagine your commute but this time on a horse-drawn carriage.)

______

&gt; *Our culture has become so money-centered, that we're forgetting other parts of life and we're slowly losing basic rights as well while 'advancing'.* 

The empires of the past didn't run on candyfloss. Money has always been at the centre of things, and always will be until we manage to create a post-scarcity society. The Lowlands, Flanders in particular, have always been rather rich compared to the rest of Europe.

Looking around I see some minor rights infringed upon from time to time but you should really think about your life in a historical context when you contemplate these things.

____

&gt;*That Western society has vastly improved the standard of living is beyond doubt, but where do you draw the line. I feel we're losing more than gaining nowadays.*

I agree with your opinion on out standard of living but frankly, as far as your other points go, you have 'no legs to stand on' so-to-speak.

Please travel to less wealthy parts of the world. Read about history. Every time I hear a fellow westerner complain like this I just laugh because it can and has been so much worse in every regard.

______

P.S. Sorry for the gigantic reply. I never once downvoted you though. This is an argument I commonly have IRL.

They will be used as some kind of hostage against you to get information. 

If you are arrested, you will be sent to http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoheneck_(Gefängnis), the only prison for female political prisoners. In this prison the wardens will try to break you using several forms of torture like solitary confinement and other things. Just think of Bradley Manning and how he is currently treated.

So when you are released from prison, you will have some kind of PTSD. And when you are about to confront your sister keep in mind that she definitely knew what will happen to you when she betrays you.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Does she seriously expect that Greece who just had its economy destroyed be the IMF and ECB

Greece destroyed its own economy for spending way more than what it could sustain for years. Don't blame a long time structural problem on the banks trying to get you back on your feet.

&gt;to pay back its debt immediately at these INSANE interest rates?

Firstly, nobody is demanding you to pay everything right now. What everyone wants is your economy not sinking anymore, while you continue to spend more than what you earn, that is simply impossible.

As for the interest rates, if you don't agree with them, then you shouldn't have asked for the loans. If you agreed to them voluntarily, what are you complaining about now? You don't just agree to something, get the benefits and then change your mind about your obligations.

&gt;How does she expect greece to pay back all this debt that was pushed onto them by astronomical interest, during what is becoming a great depression in greece?

The debt wasn't pushed onto Greece, the interest was accepted by the Greeks when they could just say no. Interest isn't what got you so deep, it was your low productivity and your astronomical spending.

Everyone else has to pay interest, otherwise nobody be interested in lending. If you really hate interest rates, then you should have just stopped asking for loans and either cut all spending or defaulted, which I doubt would have been a better scenario for you.

btw, had you kept your spending in check and not tried to fool everyone with accounting fraud, you probably would be paying less interest right now.

&gt;Its pretty sad how germany can go and murder tens of millions of people and be forgiven immediately of all there debts and thievery

Again with WW2? They were nazis, they weren't a free country under Hitler, did you know that? And they're all gone now, are you seriously trying to excuse a democratic Greek government series of fuck-ups on the economy by saying post-WW2 Germany had to be forgiven much of the harm it caused?

Are you also going to start blaming Belgians for the Congo Free State or the Spanish for the conquest of the Incas and saying that because they weren't as a people punished for those acts, you should also not have to pay for the debts you accumulated?

Or do you think punishing post-WW2 Germany like post-WW1 Germany was with the Treaty of Versailles would have been the right thing to do?

&gt;Greek people are already on the edge and too prideful to sit idly by as these banking cunts try to destroy the country.

If Greeks are on the edge, they have nobody but their governments to blame, because it was them who continued to spend more than what they should and ignoring the consequences.

Now you're all having to deal with those consequences all at once and it's not pretty, but it's certainly not the fault of the rest of the EU or the fault of those who trust in you and are giving you money to pay for your debt, that's just scapegoating and demagogy, the ""banking cunts"" aren't destroying your country, if it wasn't for them you'd now have no money at all! Those who are to blame are those you spent it all away, though I still suggest you to focus more in getting your shit together and trying to recover from all this before trying to bring those to blame to justice.",0,1338064927,null,0,1338065151,0,c4sozov,t3_u61eh,t1_c4sozov,t1_c4sngjf,null,1429006077,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

&gt;it is only after people see the long-term effects of government policies that they realize they were wrong.

That shouldn't be the case. A government should be accountable, and should be open.

true,slashasdf,NETH,The Netherlands,"Yes, adults should absolutely take responsibility for their decisions, but I believe people would make more rational decisions in elections if they were better informed about the consequences of their decisions and the decisions their politicians make. The problem is that governing a country is increasingly becoming more and more complex, this isn't easy for a regular person to keep track of.

This then creates a situation where politicians know their voters don't fully understand issues, so they can often twist the story and lie to get reelected and/or push their own issues forward. Their decisions are often also influenced by lobbyists and nepotism. Further, I agree that governments and politicians should be accountable, even after they have left office.

So while I don't believe people can always make properly informed decisions while voting for politicians, there should at least be made an effort to inform these voters more. But a higher responsibility lies with the politicians who are making the real decisions.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Depends on, a lot of people had no problem with the government, some had problems. 
On the material side of life, you got everything you needed, the rent for an appartment was very low, basic food was cheap and you could by beer and booze whenever you needed it. You did not have to worry about loosing your job, no one was jobless here. You did not have to pay for medical treatment. 

On the other hand you could not travel to the west, and even traveling to the east was sometimes a problem, especially when you were considered to be a troublemaker. 

If you understood how the system worked, you could use it for your advantage and enjoy it. 

Keep in mind, within a single year, almost over night and unexpected to almost every one, the whole political system broke down and 17 million people had to get used to a complete new and different political system and society. A lot of people lost everything they had. 

Some of my fathers classmates lost their jobs in 1990/91 in the fishing industry, shipbuilding and farming and have been jobless since then. There are places with an official unemployment rate of 20-25% where people will never ever have a job before they go into retirement. The inofficial unemployment rates are above 30-35% in some places. 

My hometown had a population of 18.500 people in 1990 and lost more than 6000 jobs within 6 month in 1991. That had a devastating impact on peoples life, families and whole parts of that town. 

So it is understandable that people live in Ostalgia and want the GDR back. ""Democracy"" and freedom of speech won't feed my children, like Manic Street Preachers sung ;-)

On the other hand you have people who had problems with the government for political reasons. Some classmates of my mother were excelled in school (EOS) but were not allowed to study because of political or religious reasons (being a church member could be a reason) or because their parents already had studied. 
Others  were bothered by the fact they could not travel freely. 

And there are of course some people who made a lot of profit after the wall came down and made some money. Though not as much as some Russian *bisinessmeny*. 


So it highly depends on who you ask and where they live. Berlin is a place that lost a lot due to second World War and after the Wall came down. And some parts of Berlin are now being highly gentrified, which causes a lot of problems and even hatred among the old people who lived there.

Scott created a company, before he became governor, which provides walk-in drug testing. When he became governor, he passed his shares in the company to his wife.

This is detailed [here, in a story ending in a comment about the shares](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0911/62977.html) and [here, in a story about how the law was temporarily blocked on the basis that it breaks fourth amendment rights, with commentary from the judge about how the law is not cost effective and its formulation deliberately ignored studies showing that it would not be cost-effective](http://colorlines.com/archives/2011/10/federal_judge_blocks_florida_law_requiring_welfare_applicants_pass_drug_tests.html).

Even worse: Most of the tourism takes place on the islands and these depend on ferries. So when Greece introduces its own money and starts to devaluing it (or better: the international markets will do that for them), the relative cost of oil in relationship to to the average income will rise rapidly, making life on the islands very, very difficult. Most of the islands also rely on diesel-powered power-plants for their electricity, so that makes it even more interesting.

* London is cool but overrated in my opinion some nicer, and MUCH cheaper places to eat/stay further north. Also in terms of motorcycle accessibility I don't think it's the best for mobility as London is basically designed around public transport.
* In terms of scenery the Yorkshire Moors and the Scottish Highlands are my favourite places (some people say North Wales, but it is about as well connected as the 3rd World in some areas **seriously** )
* Food really depends on what you like. Almost everything can be found in London. However the best fish and meat can be found in Scotland. For more specific places I would recommend [Arbroath Smokies,](http://www.arbroathsmokies.net/) [Salvo's](http://www.salvos.co.uk/) in Leeds and [Cookies](http://www.salthouse.org.uk/) in Norfolk (favourite restaurant of Stephen Fry no less)
*  I would just fit in adrenaline type stuff around your travels there is stuff to do everywhere. Though there are lots of bike trails around Ben Nevis that I can recommend first hand.
*   The 'how people live' section is best fulfilled in the most rural of the UK  such as North Wales, North/East Scotland, the coast all around the UK is always a good place to look.

Nothing wrong with that. It's a song contest. Not a geography exam. The Eurovision Song Contest is an annual competition held among active member countries of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). 
And that's it. If you're a member of EBU, you can participate. 
No need to overanalyze there. And no need to kick anyone out of EBU.

Besides, nothing stops you from creating your own ""real"" European song contest for ""real"" Europeans with ""real"" European participants with ethnic background checks and whatnot.

An article on the same topic but written for an international audience would be very different, there's much more to it than a translation.  

That said, sometimes newspapers translate articles that are of exceptional importance, even if they don't usually provide translations.
