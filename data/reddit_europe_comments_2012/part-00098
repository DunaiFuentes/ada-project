true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"Actually the average Joe does understand that printing money causes inflation which causes him to have less value for his money. Actually the problem with average Joes are that they don't understand that not all printing of money causes inflation. For example now in the Euroarea without ECB interventions we would be having deflation running around, and that causes damages too.

But lets go back to why printing money is better option than loaning money to troubled states. The good thing about printing money is that it is transparent, everybody knows what is being done, and in what scale. Compare this to loaning money where there hangs great uncertainty over debt, for example lets ask a simple question, how much debt does the Finnish state has? There are basically two answers to this, the total amount, and the amount minus money loaned via ESM and ESFS. So which is it, the one or the other - and this here is the problem, there is no definitive answer, and thus there is added uncertainness in the market. There is also added uncertainness on what are the limits of the Finnish state, where does it say no more, again more uncertainness for the markets. Not to mention that the common people are mixed up on how much the state owns and what is the financial position of the state. Not good I would say.

Of course it is another question on should there be any bailouts, but in my honest opinion a single market and single currency without authority and ability to bailout troubled states and banks and other financial institutions isn't an area that is going to survive long term. There will always be crises, we need to have mechanism to cope with them. Today in trouble are mainly southern states, however there is no guarantees that for example Germany wouldn't be in trouble someday. For example I'm seeing alarms on the state of long term German economy, there is too much debt (82%) coupled with unmanageable energy policies (no nuclear, only subsidies wind and solar) coupled with too low birth rates (who is going to work and pay the pensions), etc... What we need to do is to have ways to deal with even bailouts of big states like Germany, otherwise there is no future for the Eurozone/EU.",0,1343679738,null,0,false,0,c5lph76,t3_xduuq,t1_c5lph76,t1_c5lnrvv,null,1429509724,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Tu appelles ça anti-gauche? C'est plutôt gauche et révolutionnaire, non? Il y a sûrement un sentiment de révolution dans le film, de Catwoman qui méprise les riches au début et attend la révolution, et aussi de Bane qui fait se soulever le peuple pauvre contre le 1%. J'ai trouvé plutôt extrême gauche, toi non? Ou est-ce que c'est parce que Bane ""parle"" pour la révolution et que Batman (un des 1%) l'attaque? Puisque Bane ne parle que de ses propres intérêts et il représente pas le gauche du tout.  J'ai du mal à comprendre ce que tu veux dire par anti-gauche.

Le Batwing, c'est sûr que c'est peu réaliste (presque 1150km/h selon un redditeur). Mais... c'est Batman, qui fait un moto de sa bagnole et qui se fait enlever par avion en plein centre ville. Sa technologie en Dark Knight n'est pas vraiment plus crédible que DKR, à mon avis (les lunettes à sonar qui surveille toutes les communications de Gotham? allez...). 

Il y a eu des incohérences en effet. Mais ça me dérange pas personnellement. J'ai trouvé que c'était peut-être moins bien tourné que les autres films de Nolan (The Prestige, Dark Knight) mais pas pitoyable ou risible. Les seuls trucs qui m'ont dérangé, c'était plutôt des petites tournures de phrase cucul la praline, et le fait que Bane est éclipsé par Talia.

Il y a pas mal de films qui sont indirectement touchés par le 11 septembre, ce qui est inéluctable, mais chercher un lien plus profond que quelques images de l'île enfumé est difficile je pense (sans parler de ""hey, sept 11th redux, we fucking win this time bitch!""). C'est pas 24h Chrono. Je vois plus de références à Dickens et son Le conte de deux cités dans la pauvreté et les riches, l'inégalité, etc. Et à part ça, la réalisation du personnage de Batman lui-même.

D'ailleurs, pour ma part, je voulais que ce soit encore plus sombre que le 2eme. J'aurais préféré que le désespoir se ressentait plus: le mort d'Alfred/Fox/Gordon, et le mort ou la chute de Batman. Le fait que la ""révolution"" a eu une durée aussi courte, et que le bombe est ce qu'il faut arrêter à tout prix, ça m'a déçu un peu. J'attendais quelque chose désespérée et qui fait peur genre Dark Knight + Requiem for a Dream. En gros c'était plus Hollywood que ce que je voulais (mais on doit s'y attendre).",0,1343684081,null,0,1343684679,0,c5lqmxy,t3_xemm2,t1_c5lqmxy,t1_c5lpjq3,null,1429510268,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

I guess we'll have to work harder and to stick to our commitments. Besides, it's not something we're meant to pay in a year. Even if the economy stagnated for 20 years, 5% a year for 20 years would be enough to pay for 100% of our GDP in debt. And nobody ever pays its debts fully, we're only required 60% of GDP.

We aren't exactly rich but it would be swell if we managed to pull a Lannister and pays our debts. We need to if we want to remain competitive and prosperous on the long run.

Thankfully we're not the US and I don't really foresee a civil war over slavery. Oh, and that argument is also for a stronger central state. You basically said if it were the states who hold the power and not the capital in DC, they wouldn't have that issue.

-Un Bane impressionant. On sent une bête furieuse et féroce à chaque fois qu'il se bat. Il fait peur. Point Noir: il méritait mieux que de se faire tuer comme une merde par Catwoman... (incroyablement décevant)

-Michael Caine n'apparait que dans 3 ou 4 scènes, mais il est incroyablement captivant/émouvant á chaque fois.

-Les sauts dans le temps (8 ans, puis 2 mois... etc) bien que necessaires ne ""passent pas"". Hop je fais rien depuis 8 ans, hop je me remet à marcher, hop on me casse le dos, hop je reviens tranquille depuis l'autre bout du monde dans un Gotham ""encerclé"" par l'armée...

-le cliché du Batman qui se sacrifie en prenant la bombe avec lui (évidemment t'as beau être multi-millionaire, c'est toujours l'auto pilote qui ne marche pas!!)

-J'ai senti le rôle de Marion Cotillard moyennement écrit

-J'ai plutôt aimé l'interprétation de Catwoman. A part peut-être la partie ""romance"" avec Wayne durant la fin.

-Black qui ""devine"" l'identitée de Batman parcequ'il l'a vu dans ses yeux ? Baaaah...

-Niveau politique, oui c'est assez anti-anarchiste/terroriste, bon... ca a quelques bonnes pistes de réflexion mais bien sur ca termine par la victoire des gentils... 

-La scène d'intro, bien qu'on l'ai vu y'a quelques mois reste la plus impressionante à mon goût...

How much money has Europe made from the web economy, vs how much it would have made if it had been a walled garden? I think (although I can't find sources, so be wary!) that it's made far more money by sharing it than otherwise.

Also, it was a very unusual case as it was invented under the auspices of CERN. Not only do scientists in particle physics tend to share as much as possible, to get the field to thrive, but by doing so effectively the whole damn world 'owes' CERN hundreds of billions of Swiss francs for their free invention. A very clever way to browbeat politicians into funding it (as well as being factually true).

Now, examples one and two are extremely good ones, and what bothers me about examples one and two is that they are both British; I agree they're true, and _that's_ what's horrible! It's something us Brits complain about, but that doesn't necessarily make it true; however, it seems it really is true :-(

We shouldn't either forget that the EU already has structural and cohesion funds that benefit less developed and wealthy member states. The good thing about these funds are that receiving member states have to put their own money too into projects, thus ensuring that at least some economic thought is put into these.

Lastly, wealth transfers in my honest opinion are form of admitting that some states and places won't ever catch up, and this is pretty foreign idea to me.

Romania is a [semi-presidential system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-presidential_system). The President and Prime Minister are both pretty powerful, and they have to work together despite being voted in at different times and through different mechanisms (the President is elected by direct vote, the PM is approved into office and responsible to the Parliament, whose members are themselves elected at a different time). In a system like this, of course there will be conflicts between the President and the Parliament majority, and in extreme cases when they can't find common ground there has to be a way to diffuse these conflicts.

The bottom line is that the Constitutional Court of Romania ruled that this impeachment process was legal. Also, the official reasons for the impeachment refer to the President exceeding his Constitutional limits, not the people's dissatisfaction with him.

So in my view, the statement that the impeachment was illegal is disputed and is itself a tool in the political war. Even the EU's reaction may have a lot of politics in it.

I actually understand how the Euro is more important. I can't imagine what will happen if it collapses.

german riot police is the last in the european union that does not have name tags.


German riot police is the last in europe without a penaltycatalogue (Strafkatalog) and only has a penalty catalogue (Bußgeldkatalog).

While civilized cops in civilized countries actually do have to fear jailtime for the commited crimes, german cops still get early pensions (Frühpension) or a minor slap on the hand.

From the riot cops that I know personally (hundertschaft berlin, hunderschaft eutin)  I get told all the time to just run away when I see some of their kind because the vast majority of riot cops joined those forced FOR THE RIOT and not like civilized beings to help others.

Let's jsut start with a simple criminalcode (Strafgesetzbuch) that says how long a cop has to go to jail for any extreme violence. that would already be a huuughe improvement.

Während unsere Nachbarn (außer Osten) bereits kostensloses Internet in Bibliotheken hatte, englischsprachige Webseiten ansurfte und wusste was FTP ist, konnten Deutsche kaum Videotext bedienen.

Dieser Fehler ist von der Regierung konsequent weitergeführt worden, indem man nach der Einführung von DSL sich über mehr als 10 Jahre selbst abgefeiert hat.Die Mehrheit der ""Hochgeschwindigkeits-Internetnutzer"" in Deutschland leiden unter einem ""bis zu 16MBit"" DSL, welches defacto kaum 2MBit bedient.

Das macht sich in der Wirtschaft genauso bemerkbar wie im E-Sport oder eben der digitalen Weiterentwicklung der Bevölkerung.
Auch Franzosen sprechen äußerst inakzeptabel Englisch, aber die Bevölkerung ist digital deutlich weiterentwickelt gegenüber Deutschland.

As for what we're going to call the language... well, that's also complicated. You see, in the Balkans we always joke around about needing a translator to speak with one another, but the truth is that the languages are virtually identical. Some words are different (like the names of the months, and other small things), but other than that the languages are completely the same. It would be a lot like giving one of the many accents in Britain its own name to distinguish its status as a separate language. It's silly, right? The only reason it makes sense in the case of Serbia and Croatia is that they're separate nation-states. Pretty flimsy, but hey, that's the way it is. 

Whenever I meet someone that can speak Croatian, or talk about that region of the Balkans, I always say that they speak *our* language, ephasizing that it belongs to all of us. I never say Serbian or Croatian as I am careful not to offend, which is still sadly possible. And I never-ever say Serbo-Croatian, as that sounds even stupider. At least, I think so.

The international community, at least the linguists, seem to lean towards that term. It's clunky but at least it's politically correct and emphasises that from a purely linguistic point of view, there are a few dialects of the same language spread across the territory of both countries. None of them are that far from any other to outright call them a separate language, so there is no ""Croatian"" dialect and a ""Serbian"" dialect, there is a set of Croatian dialects and a set of Serbian dialects. As the countries are trying to regulate a literary language based on the dialects in their respective countries, we might see a divergence to a separate Croatian and a separate Serbian language but such processes take time.

But then we're completely ignoring Bosnian which is yet still just a set of dialects of Serbo-Croato-Bosnian. Add a few more and I guess it'll just be easier to change the rules of what a language is.

&gt; It would be a lot like giving one of the many accents in Britain its own name to distinguish its status as a separate language. It's silly, right?

Scots is a topic for the same debate, with some people claiming it is a language separate from English, and with others saying it's just a weird way to pronounce English with some special vocabulary on top.

&gt; As for Albania... Unless the Kosovo situation gets resolved, I don't think we'll ever see Albania and Serbia on friendly terms in our lifetime.

I know this is a touchy subject, especially that you're Serbian, but I think the solution of just not giving Kosovo to either of the countries is the only sane approach that's currently implementable. I think the power is imbalanced to favour the ethnic Albanians and it's a problem that needs to be resolved as soon as possible, but otherwise there is no solution that will not favour either of the countries. Both have claims in the area, depending on whom you ask both have *legitimate* claims and giving the place to either will leave the other butt-hurt, so why not just say ""screw it"" and give it to neither? Instead of dividing the people into Serbs and Albanians, the Kosovan government should encourage a separate Kosovan identity and help the people feel proud to be simply Kosovans of this or that ancestry. The international community distrusts both governments and feels neither can realistically guarantee the necessary protections for whoever becomes the minority, and we're really trying to be independent arbiters, you know.

&gt; And Macedonia/Greece? I understand where Greece is coming from

Me too. I also understand where Macedonia is coming from. The problem is that both countries are stuck in the past too much, instead of looking to the future. Yes, the region was Macedonia for a while, Hellada for a while, then back again, sometimes both, then not then yeah and trying to solve it now, through rigid, political and administrative boundaries is just pointless.

Hence why, apart from throwing money at their economies so they don't collapse and take all of us down with them, eurozone/EU or not, we're also forcing regulations on them to fix the root cause, instead of just treating the symptoms. Now, they're being angry we're forcing regulations on top of them with the euromonies but they don't seem to mind the hand-outs. It can't work this way and I think we should be helping the countries willing to take on reform, and the people there need to realise those reforms must be implemented. Otherwise we just stop the money, no bullshit. Wall them off and let them fix their own problems if they don't want help.

I'm very happy to help Spain. Apart from a few incidents, they seem to be actually trying to get back on their feet. Their problems were caused by a housing bubble, not policy, and now when we force reforms on them, they are (hesitantly, but still) implementing them. For Spain, it's just a classic case of ""shit happens"" and it's important to help them as they're a big chunk of the European economy.

On the other hand we have Greece which lied about their economic performance to get euro *despite public opposition* (ringing any bells, my Estonian?), widespread (almost casual) corruption, generations of bad policy, the effects of which were all hidden from view until now (yet they were always very real) and generally brought it upon itself. Now, it's easy to blame the people, but I doubt they've had much choice. True, they got very used to their cosy socialism, but who wouldn't, when you're being lied to that everything's fine? I mean, they've managed to fool *the EU*, what's a few million lay citizens? Now the Greek people are pissed off at EU for the regulations and at their government for bending over to the pressure. No wonder, it's not *their* fault. However, they seem to forget that we're not trying to pressure them because we want to show how powerful we are and we want to make the Greek/Portuguese/Spanish/Italian people miserable. Apart from forcing reforms, we're chucking *fucktons* of money into their shitty economies, precisely so that the people don't end up too miserable.

One good thing that will come out of this whole shitty situation is that it'll show if such massive political constructs that European Union and Eurozone are are at all viable in the long term. It was all fine and candy when the economies were booming, the old countries got a lot of growth thanks to free trade and open borders, they helped patch each other up here and there and then thrown trucks of money at the new countries to help them get up to the Western standards. The first time I went to visit Poland (a few years after it joined the EU) I was amazed at how the country's changed. The place is cleaner, there are new roads, new train tracks, renovated buildings and all. Granted, I didn't remember much from before I've moved out, but I've always had that sense of a dirty, fucked up place that I nevertheless loved as home. When I came back, it was all gone.

Now we have a crisis and it's a big test, whether in our weakest moment this whole union thing will survive. The South is in big trouble and they're dragging us all down with them but if we don't help them they *will* drag the rest of us down. Blind chucking of the money won't work, the reforms themselves will make people miserable, they need both the money and the reforms. You can give a man a fish and they'll eat for a day (blind handouts) or teach them to fish (the reforms), but if they don't have a lake or a river nearby, their new skill is useless.

I hope the EU can be tougher on forcing the regulations and reforms, and I'm looking up to Germany to stay strict and keep this place together.

While in reality they are just thieves that should have been purged from politics with iron and fire long ago. But the EU always squeals if anyone ever is treated roughly and withing such conditions you simply cannot implement a law-and-order policy, you cannot stamp out the hotbeds of corruption.

This is why you can't do anything, not until something really changes philosophically in the EU and will see results more important that methods. 

Now if for example the EU would accept the reintroduction of capital punishment and accept the summary execution of corrupted people like they do in China then corruption could be ended quickly.  But in the current liberal political climate it is impossible.

So you see Italy, Hungary, South and East faces contradicting requirements from the EU: ""get things in order"" and ""play nice, democratic, liberal, human rights"". It is not possible. In reality if it was allowed to shoot the 1000 worst corrupted people in every country in the head things could be brought into order but not before that.",0,1343742869,null,0,false,0,c5m1qh5,t3_xfz55,t1_c5m1qh5,t1_c5m0ck1,null,1429515568,-5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-5

Communism sucked. This whole post-communist democratic capitalist revolution thing sucked. Everything afterwards sucked. It still sucks as hard as ever. I know that. I can't see it first-hand since I'm not there but I read enough news and talk to enough people to know.

The East might be having nice market capitalism, free, democratic elections, but the people are still the same. A few countries broke apart, some got renamed but the people stayed. And *people* don't change that fast. Revolutions are quick, but they're also brutal.

&gt; On top of everything, we joined the Eurozone at the worst time, and it swetp our feet out from under us. 

Yeah, ""you"" picked literally (and I mean literally literally, not figuratively), *the worst* possible moment for joining the eurozone. I take it there wasn't any referendum on that either.

&gt; the people that lead you can't solve all the problems.

I can see how people from post-communist countries can have a hard time wrapping their mind around the idea that the government isn't some all-powerful entity that ""knows best"", even if that's just the propaganda. I'm surprised that people in the West trust their governments so much, with the net effect being the same.

&gt; But thanks for taking the time to explain. It's all interesting to know.

Well, I only explained my point of view. I don't necessarily know everything. I just find it doubtful that it's the *individual people* of Spain or Italy or Greece which are at fault here. We can't be angry at them, just as we can't be angry at our grandparents that communism happened. The individuals have no say and for the most part they just want to carry on a peaceful life.

Ce genre de messages passe fréquemment, pour bien faire comprendre au peuple US que les méchants c'est ""les autres"".
La preuve en est que, suite au refus de la France de participer à la dernière invasion Irakienne (devenant ainsi les ""ennemis"" des USA, allant jusqu'au boycott de certains produits estampillés FR),  certains ""méchants"" de films, originalement de nationalité américaine, se sont retrouvés d'un coup Français ...

Ca reste un block buster! Gros effets spéciaux, gros casting, grosse histoire (même si tu sembles un peu refroidi sur ce point) et finalement, grosse trilogie qui se termine de la même façon qu'elle a commencé : par du gros spectacle.

Otherwise, who does that leave in Italy? Monti, someone who was supposedly untouched by 'politics' was succesful initially (but then almost anyone would have been better than Silvio) but it now seems even he can't do that much about many of Italy's deeper problems, and he growing increasingly unpopular.

Grillo? He doesn't seem to be much more than a populist demagogue, (rightly) criticising the politicians but not really offering anything in return.

Italy already tried overturning the entire political class, and voting for a man who claimed to offer an alternative to the decades of corruption and *transformismo*, and who was that? Silvio Berlusconi.

The coverage (in Germany) is best at Telekom (especially in east-germany), O2 and Vodafone are quite the same.

The reason why I did not say anything about eplus is, that they just ""rent"" their infrastructure to other companies. Eplus will be the cheapest but their internet speed will be quite low and the coverage will also be much weaker than on vodafone , telekom or O2. 

So, if you only want to call people i think you would go with an eplus powered provider quite good but as you are a redditor i would suggest you a prepaid vodafone or O2 deal because they have a the fastest internet and are cheaper than the telekom.

Look, you clearly don't understand simple concepts such as fiscal constraints, which makes this discussion obviously limited to the superficial level. The major burden for public expenditures lies in welfare provisioning, but restructuring the public sector does not equate to dismantling it. Instead, it has to be tuned according to the fiscal capacity of the country. However, being the utter fucking moron that you are, you manage to single-handedly complain about over-taxation and refuse to even acknowledge that the current public sector is unsustainable, despite the fact that all the available data does not support your silly world view. Where the fuck do you think the money to pay for public expenses comes from, asshat? When taxes are cut the economy doesn't even adjust instantly, even if you did it slowly you'd have a huge fiscal shortfall as has always been the case in Portugal for more than a decade despite successive pro-aggregate demand policies. Even then, a boost in demand through an increase in the ""purchasing power"" of the ""poorer classes"" would aggravate the external position of the country, considering how it's not competitive internationally. This shit isn't even about austerity, it's about common fucking sense, if there's an external imbalance you are financing consumption with foreign debt, moron. Until external competitiveness is restored, ""cures"" like yours only serve to accelerate the rate of bankruptcy, maybe then you'd understand that opposition to scaling the public sector shouldn't be dogma, since it's better to have less than nothing. It's also funny that you suggest increasing the purchasing power of the ""poorer"" classes, as if that hadn't been tried by multiple governments in the last decade, with atrocious results in terms of external balance and, consequently, anemic economic growth followed by a crumbling fiscal position.

Do you even know what a rhetorical question is, idiot? It was meant as a mere assertion, since what you said is obviously linked to the necessary restructuring process that the public sector needs to undertake and which I had previously alluded. I guess you're the one that needs to get some actual skills in order to develop some semblance of reading comprehension.

You did not enumerate the BIG spending problems. Let's see, possible cost recoupments from the public-private partnerships don't cover the CURRENT budget short-fall, let alone an hypothetical scenario where taxes are lowered. The other issue, fighting corruption is yet again something that cannot be solved overnight, let alone by moaning about spending cuts, nor have many progresses been made - which was my whole point, too bad you failed to grasp that. However, that's just another public sector correction that needs to take place in order to stop rent seekers from capturing wealth. I guess you were too busy going berserk over the mere mention of touching the public sector in order to actually think. Oops.

There is indeed a theoretical tax rate that maximizes tax revenue, I'm familiar with the Laffer curve. Too bad, you do not know whether it has been surpassed. Why? Tax revenues decrease in a recession, period. Is the reduction of tax revenues because of an excessive burden or due to economic slowdown? Since the economic slowdown wasn't a byproduct of the hypothetical excessive tax burden, you would require more information to make an assertion. Guess what, you are talking out of your ass. Oops again.

Are you daft? Where did I say that ""aimless tax increases"" and ""cutting pennies"" was the optimal solution. Can you read? I mentioned RESTRUCTURING the public sector. Don't extrapolate bullshit based on your petty hatred. 

You are delusional, go look at the data and stop relying on neat fantasies. There will be no Deus Ex Machina to save you from corruption, claiming the public sector as untouchable only furthers the interests that feed off the state.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"A lot of people here don't seem to understand how this works, so I'll try and cover it for you.

1. Greece issues bonds to investors saying ""give me this much money, youll get so and so percent interest and then the lump sum back on the maturation date"".
2. Some people get scared that Greece is going to default, so they sell the issued bonds on the *secondary market*. 
3. The ECB apparently bought these bonds on the secondary market at a 30% discount of the maturation amount.
4. Greece still has to repay the original amount.

Why?

Well, if Greece were to repay only what the ECB paid for it, financial markets would be screaming 'default' and chaos would erupt everywhere. Why would the ECB buy it?

Wrong, the adjustments that are required for the PPPs as a whole are not enough the cover the budget shortfall, unless you consider complete and unlawful expropriation an alternative. Which is insane, for a couple of reasons.

The public sector is everything that covers revenues and expenditures of the Portuguese state, social expenses just happen to represent a large volume that is more easily alienable while maintaining social stability. In case you haven't noticed, I was the one that mentioned merely touching the public sector, you attacked me as if I had ever advocated abolishing social provisioning.

As far as the ECB is concerned, this is a eurozone problem, not necessarily an EU problem, and that's why it needs the concerted action of the heads of states to approve of something like this.

Germany is really close, Bavaria and Muchen are full of things to see and do. Innsbruck in Austria is even closer, just outside the border, nice city surrounded by mountains (they have a casino too). In Switzerland there are really nice views and plenty of wonderful mountains and lakes. Southern France will be crowded of tourists in this period but full of amazing cities to visit, Aix en Provence and Avignon are closer and very beautiful. 

I'd suggest to hit Germany/Austria, since it'll be more different than Italy, southern France landscapes and villages can be more related to their Italian counterpart (it's Mediterranean after all, baby!).

Don't know about eurail pass, better ask at a train station (if you can find a nice english speaking ticket seller). Sometimes Trenitalia has good deals on trains that are hard to spot on their official website. Just tell the guy/girl where you'd like to go and if there are some promotions or discount, maybe some weekend promotions/special night fares. 

Give a look at Ryanair, train tickets got expensive lately and sometimes plane fares are 50% cheaper than trains, just chose shitty departure times and you can save a lot!
