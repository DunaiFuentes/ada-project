Now, I have little opinion on whether Israel should have been created in the first place mainly because I lack the perspective to comment on what would have happened if it had not been but to say that a whole people need to ""grow up"" because they disagree with an intervention by a 3rd party that permanently affected their lives for the worse seems very dismissive. 

On the stolen land thing, imagine Denmark invade the north of England saying they have a historical claim to the land from the brief line of Danish kings in Anglo-Saxon history. Would it make sense to say that as long as they held onto that land for 1 generation so that no-one alive can remember the invasion that the British government needs to grow up and accept the Danish occupation? I certainly wouldn't stand for it and I would be very surprised if you would too. The Israeli claim is pretty much identical except its about 1000 years longer ago. It may be true that after one generation of people the difficulty of removing people once again to disassemble Israel is impractical but that does not mean that I, or anyone else cannot look back at history and point out the failures and successes in policy that led to the current situation.

The Senora that we rented a room from was from Mozambique. In conversation I asked to take a picture with her so I send it to my parents. She responded hesitantly and she asked ""Will it bother them that I am black?"" She clearly was aware that people in Spain are not comfortable with black people and assumed that my white American parents would share the same negative attitude. I gladly showed her a picture of my white dad with my black step-mom. 

While I remember reading an article that touched on the subject that many of the African futbol teams didn't like playing in Spain because the fans would make racist and derogatory remarks. 

Those are just a couple of examples that pop to mind. 

In the U.S. African Americans went from being called niggers, to colored, to black, and now African American. This demonstrates the evolution of the sensitising of the American public. Spain is currently at African Spaniards are coloreds.

The problem with hiring people isn't paying people their wages, after all, you don't hire people if you are not going to make profit from them. The problem in French is that you can't get rid of people when they aren't making profit for the company, and thus companies won't hire people as they don't want or can't take the risk of keeping the same people for ages.

For example the company I work for, just fired 20 and layoff 40 people after co-operation negotiations had ended, however just moments after announcing this, they also put an hiring advertisement for 17 new jobs. In France our company would have already gone bankrupt.
 
Actually what this new offer will actually do is to give hidden subsidies for companies. Why so? Because only companies that would have hired new people even without subsidies are the only ones who are going to hire them with subsidies.

Growing up in America, since my skin is slightly darker than others, I have been called a ""spick"", ""dirty Mexican"" ""filthy immigrant"", and an ""illegal alien"" amongst many other names. Spaniards aren't the racist ones. As a matter of fact, on one of my recent trips to Madrid, we were leaving the east end of the city to visit family in one of the smaller towns and passed a building with a giant banner that read ""no whites allowed"" referring to the Spaniards. The Africans in Spain are the actual racists. 

I was approached while leaving the train station in Madrid by an African gentlemen and was offered drugs. He even asked me in English, although I look and dressed 100% Spanish. Almost every African I saw was selling drugs. At the same time, people were sitting and eating, drinking, and talking with black Spaniards.

Why didn't you assume she had a mistaken view of the mainstream American views on race? You will find many Spaniards, particularly the left-wing America-phobic variety, believe stereotypical redneck racism to be the norm in the US.

&gt;In the U.S. African Americans went from being called niggers, to colored, to black, and now African American. This demonstrates the evolution of the sensitising of the American public. Spain is currently at African Spaniards are coloreds.

I would hardly call the fact that Spain hasn't jumped on the euphemism treadmill as a sign of racism. America has complex historical connotations for words such as _nigger_ (slavery) and _coloured_ (segregation), and I would question that people have replaced _black_ for _African American_ in colloquial speach; there appears to be some backlash against that save for technical usages. 

In Spain, on the contrary, the great majority of black people are recent immigrants from Africa. There are no complex sensibilities to tiptoe around, no long-term fight for civil rights or for recognition, and no shared culture between them that has resulted in a specific sociological group. They are just recently arrived people who happen to be _negro_ (the colour) in Spanish. To find that racist is failing to recognize that American historical perspectives and sensibilities are not applicable globally. 

As an example of the opposite effect, the usage of the word _español_ vs. _castellano_ to refer to the Spanish language carries a strong connotation when being contrasted with other languages of Spain such as Catalan or Basque. Calling Spanish _español_ in this context implies a certain Spanish nationalism and despise for regional languages. However, I would be extremely naïve if I were to assume that a comment by an American on /r/linguistics was  being contemptuous of Catalan because it referred to _Spanish_ instead of _Castillian_.

true,L11,null,null,"&gt; Just to name one example, the Spanish national basketball team in the Beijing Olympics posed for their press photo all holding their fingers over their eyes, emulating the ""slanty eyes"" of asians. Nobody at the time thought this might be wrong or insulting. Only after being slammed by international media did they wake up and apologise for their actions, probably wondering why everyone made such a big deal of it.

I was pretty shocked when this happened too but for the opposite reason, because I couldn't understand how imitating a racial feature and/or making cultural references out of your own race and culture (with no disrespectful purposes, of course) could be something offensive by default. Years later I found out this is very common for the US people (I don't know where you are from, just saying) but not for people from other countries. Personally I can't find racist a Filipino rocking an afro wig or a Russian woman dressed as a proper Chapolera from head to toe or a Japanese wearing a flamenco custome and singing a ranchera just for the hell of it - I might find it ignorant in this case, but not racist.
Sometimes you have to put things in context because your values and standards are not the same everywhere. For example, if 10-15 years ago somebody from the US went to see the Spanish Cavalcade of Magi they would freak out after seeing a *white* man with his face painted black. And fair enough, they would inmediatly relate it to the blackface, the minstrel shows and all that, but in Spain that concern doesn't even exist, it's not part of its history and culture. And this applies to the racial features thing, in Spain making the slanty eyes gesture (which is not necessarily directed at Asian people only) is a reference to that physical feature, nothing less, nothing more.

&gt; Obviously, there are exceptions to this, and some Spaniards are genuinely accepting and non-racist. But they are definitely in a minority, especially in the younger generations. Oddly, the older generations appear more tolerant, but that may be down to the level of education where they do not publicly disclose their prejudiced views.

Totally disagree. Young people is way more open and accepting than older generations, hands down. I especially have faith in today's little kids since they are able to experience diversity from day one. Older generations is something you should not bother about, they are a a total lost case. Spain has a long way to go to progress as a society and sadly it's going to take more time than we really wish for many many reasons.",0,1346496802,null,0,false,0,c61vdfc,t3_z50al,t1_c61vdfc,t1_c61o1sh,null,1429789656,6,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,6

Another side of this is that we become hyper-sensitive to others lack of consideration about these issues.  The slanty eyes poses are very common in Spain, not only with older uneducated people.

Even if I don't find the original painting and the use of it offensive either, it would be interesting to see if there are other non-offensive ways to approach the slavery ages or if it's something you simply shouldn't discuss.

About Spain, yes, Spain is racist. I can think of other countries that are in the same or even a higher level (US, Korea or Dominican Republic for example) but that doesn't make it any better, denying the truth won't solve anything; Spanish society needs to acknowledge the issue and work on it from its roots. Spanish history is not easy and probably it developed in some kind of not-so-hidden racism that it's showing off with the actual crisis, also in politics which is disgusting.

true,kyr004,CYPR,Cyprus,"Reasons why Turkey is acting like a total bully in the region and reacting in a disgusting manner:

1. Republic of Cyprus government already promised that around 15%-20% of any wealth gained from tapping the gas will go to the Turkish Cypriot community, since they too are members of the Republic of Cyprus. They are Cypriots who come under the protection of the Republic of Cyprus and not a foreign country, Turkey. 15%-20%, because that is the proportion of Turkish Cypriots on the island. So everyone gets a fair amount. Turkey is pissed off because it will not get any money, and rightfully so, because that shelf of offshore area belongs exclusively to the jurisdiction of ""Republic of Cyprus"". Turkey has NO CLAIM to it. Turkey is also pissed off because the Republic of Cyprus is taking care of its Turkish citizens, something very embarrassing for the government of Turkey, who for so long has tried to portray Republic of Cyprus as a ""foreign enemy"". 

2. The Turkish ""drilling"" is an absolute joke and there is no possible way they will find any natural gas. They are drilling over land (which makes it very hard to dig deep - they can only drill 20% of what Noble Energy can drill), using laughably unsophisticated technology, and basically they are only drilling to avoid embarassment and save face. ""If the Greeks can do it so can we"". Meanwhile, the Republic of Cyprus hired Noble Energy, one of the most professional names in this industry, who are drilling in the correct region, over water, and can drill over 10,000 metres. They are an American company and have the expertise and equipment to drill correctly, unlike the Turks. They are so much infinitely more likely to find gas than the Turks.

3. The 150,000 illegal Turkish settlers brought by Turkey from Anatolia, who have been ilegally occupying refugees' homes for 38 years, deserve nothing of the money potentially gained from drilling. They have no right to be in Cyprus. They are the people who voted for a nationalist leader in occupied Cyprus (Eroglu), they are the people who insist on Turkey being involved in every Cyprus matter, they are the people who support the bully in the region, they are the people who are the political voting weight, outnumbering Turkish Cypriots, and causing tension in the region.

Es ist ein freies Forum und jeder darf sagen, was er will. Klar, volle Zustimmung. Ich halte es aber für wichtig, dass man darüber nach denkt was man postet oder ob man es gleich lassen kann. Das Niveau eines freien Forums lebt von der Diszipilin der Poster. Wenn hier eine Hivemind-Meinung abgegeben wird und man dafür natürlich geupvotet wird, dann schadet das unserem Subreddit, schlichtweg weil es zur Vereinfachung speziell bei Diskussionen (die wir hier ja sowieso nicht haben, aber gut) einlädt.

Nochmal zur subjektiven Wahrnehmung und warum sie so problematisch ist. Sie macht es uns zu einfach eine Stellung einzunehmen, die viel zu problematisch ist. Frauen können nicht Autofahren gehört da schon zu den harmloseren, es zieht sich aber durch die Bank weg, dass die subjektive Wahrnehmung dazu führt, dass Menschen anders handeln. Z. B. sind sie nervös mit einer Frau am Fahrersitz zu fahren, aufgrund ihrer subjektiven Wahrnehmung und der übernommenen subjektiven Wahrnehmung von anderen. Das führt dann dazu, das Menschen Schiss haben, die U-Bahn zu benutzen, weil sie ja ins Krankenhaus geprügelt werden, obwohl ihnen noch nie so etwas passiert ist und die Einzelfälle, in denen so etwas passiert, medial aufgeblasen werden (um noch mal auf die Veranwortung von Medien zurückzukommen).

true,timoleon,FRNK,Franken,"&gt;Dass Tausende von ihnen tagtäglich der irrwitzigsten antisemitischen Hetze ausgesetzt sind durch iranische, türkische und arabische Medien, die sie per Satellit im Wohnzimmer in Berlin, München und Hamburg konsumieren? 

Da eben liegt das Dilemma: 

bei einer demonstrativ pro-jüdische Haltung würde man prompt als anti-palästinensisch, anti-arabisch, anti-türkisch etc. verdammt.

&gt;ist eine große und bewusste Bereitschaft zur Zivilcourage, zur Solidarität und zum bedingungslosen

Gegen wen?  Für wen?  

Welche Minderheit ist solidaritätswürdiger als die anderen, welcher Hass bekämpfenswerter?

Und nebenbei: ""*bedingungslos*"" ist politisch ein ebenso zweifelhaftes Adjektiv wie ""*alternativlos*"".  

Bedenken und Widerspruch im voraus abzuwürgen ist eine zweifelhaft Taktik bei der Suche nach Unterstützung.

&gt;Mit Kippa, Krav Maga und einer überfälligen Welle der Solidarität der deutschen Politik und Gesellschaft, 

Warum muss Deutschland sich ""unbedingt"" die Konflikte anderer Länder importieren? 

Dabei gibt es für niemanden etwas zu gewinnen, aber für alle viel zu verlieren.

Sérieusement.

Au lieu de laisser-faire les lobbies, laisser-faire les usagers, utilisateurs, consommateurs, producteurs, face à cet immense marché qu'est Internet. En termes culturels, l'urgence n'est pas là. En termes culturels, il n'y a d'ailleurs pas d'urgence ; la production culturelle se construit d'elle-même. De Homère à Baudelaire, on a jamais eu besoin de technocrates pour s'occuper de tout ça.

Tout cela est un non-problème. C'est une non-question. Abolissons l'HADOPI, laissons-faire, laissons les vieilles institutions mourir d'elles-mêmes. Le droit de propriété intellectuelle est utile dans certains domaines, mais on voit bien qu'il s'agit d'un frein à l'innovation, et même à la diffusion culturelle ou des idées, à force d'être considéré comme L'Elément majeur de toute politique culturelle, intellectuelle et scientifique.

Même dans l'industrie, les brevets ne sont pas les plus importants pour protéger/favoriser l'innovation. Les guerres de brevets illustrent juste une façon sale de mener une guerre commerciale, et il faudrait que je vous retrouve l'étude si cela vous tente, mais il n'y a que dans la pharmacie, la chimie et l'ingénierie génétique que les brevets sont le moyen le plus utilisé pour protéger/favoriser l'innovation.

Franchement, c'est triste d'imaginer que l'HADOPI, coûteuse et inutile, ne soit pas encore dans le caniveau.

C'est la logique de l'Etat français, hein, depuis un bail, dès qu'il s'agit d'espaces culturels et de lobbies.

We bought a (roughly) 2,300sft home here in the US, which is considered humongous. The first question from my aunt was ""how are you going to keep THAT clean?"", because Germans consider help with cleaning their house either as frivolous/arrogant, or as a failure. Besides, they also are very intent on keeping their privacy and don't want strangers roaming their house all the time. And yes, most everything is smaller in Germany, inlcuding garages. The suburban McMansions, where the garages take up the entire front of the home and then there is a little side entrance, are ugly and vulgar. Architecturally, the attempt is made to integrate them into the front, or side, of the house much better. 

Bonus round: The fact that I have a huge water heater in my basement here in the US, constantly keeping the water at a certain temperature, boggles my (Geman) familiy's mind. It's considered wasteful when there are more efficient ways to do it. Which I will as soon as get an integrated solar heating system up that also heats my warm water. Don't get me started on using the dryer all the time instead of hanging laundry out to dry....

AC: a) there hasn't been a historic need to cool your houses in Europe - which may change with global warming since the summers recently have been much hotter, b) to ""temperate"" your house, you open what's called ""a window"" there, c) German are very sensitive to what's called ""Durchzug"", meaning they can't stand a cold draft in any form for very long and almost every single German I know in the US despises AC for that reason, including myself. Many joking conversations with my friends led me to conclude that this is an insurmountable cultural difference ;) There are places, were you can't live without AC, of course, like Texas of Florida, but that's not the point of this exemplification.

true,flyingkangaroo,null,null,"I have never understood my own Western culture's fascination for modern medical techniques and drugs. It's as if people believe that doctors hold the key for maintaining and preserving excellent health. Maybe it's just because I have never had enough money to make visiting doctors a part of my routines... but I have learned that under normal circumstances, given the right life habits and the right kind of diet, the human body is designed to take care of itself quite well. It doesn't get sick arbitrarily. Rather, it's only when you're not taking care of yourself that you put yourself at risk of illness and disease. 

I'm not a woman, and so I've never experienced pregnancy... but I'm sure there are unique ways one needs to learn to maintain one's health and well-being during the early months of pregnancy as well. To just take the latest shiny new drug off the shelf, in order to try to beat morning sickness doesn't strike me as reflecting very good judgement.

Worse yet, I know senior citizens who regularly take a raft of fifteen or twenty different drugs for various things. Again, it seems to reflect very poor judgement on their part. Logically each drug by itself imposes risks, and when mixing and matching there can be even more risks. 

My mother was the editor of a medical journal when I was a teen... and I became very jaded during those years as I saw the process by which research is done and trends in the medical world are established. It's kind of like what they say about how legislation is made in Washington DC - ""It's like making sausage - it's not a pretty sight to see.""

I value what doctors do to patch people up after accidents... we've had some serious ones in my family. Furthermore, I understand the importance people place on last ditch efforts to save people's lives. It's a human thing to rage against the dying of the light.

12:03 : Un beau mille, c'est pas pro, ça, Sylvain. On a pas vu les ombres chinoises :(

16:54 : Enchainement magnifique entre un sujet sur Michel Polac et le générique des Snorkies, une petite danse de Sylvain en prime.

What I mean is that we might not use the ideal words for some things, but it's never used in anything that can be related to something negative. It's just that sometimes is stupid to overthink what words are you going to use just in case somebody gets offended, I mean, when I'm talking to a black person, do I have to overthink it and think, hey should I call him ""african man""?

there are so many things wrong with that sentence. First, it was something suggested one of the asian sponsors, so so much for complete ignorance of other cultures.

Some people do get offended, I get that, but only because it's taboo in some countries for white people to do racial gestures or because in those countries, those gestures have a meaning *associated with them*. 

As you have seen here, japanese TV makes a video doing exactly the same thing, making use of white's characteristics. In the american TV show Heroes a Japanese guy jokingly says that all whites look alike. Do I get offended because of this? of course not, it appeals to some real racial features, it suggests nothing offensive nor insulting. I find them funny even. I see Chris Rock or David Chapelle making fun of whites all fucking day long and it cracks me up.

Getting offended over that gesture? A bunch of utter and complete bullshit. Calling them racists no less, for doing it? please. Some people *reeeeeally* need to take a fucking chill pill over race.

I once read an interview with a German woman who used to live in the GDR, and she claimed that it was very sad how people became obsessed with income and money, whereas before they never had to think about either. Their future was predictable. 

I'm not defending the old regimes but I think its an interesting phenomenon. The Czech Communist Party is getting close to becoming the country's largest political party according to some polls. And Die Linke still does very well in Germany's eastern states.

I think if you're in a situation where banning mutilating the genitals of children causes nationwide outrage to the point where it would be an overall negative effect you need to take a good long think about if that is a nation you should care about the stability of.

But I don't believe that. I personally think Germany to be one of the greatest countries in the world, but this is one of it's serious flaws (which it shares with much of the world of course). But if such a ban took place, in future decades it would be seem as a great step forward for humanity, we will look back on mutilating the genitals of children and think ""wow, we were fucking barbarians in 2012"".

Now please don't take this part personally as I'm using the example as it's familiar and accessible - and a great piece of human history that no members of modern society *should* even feel guilty about. But instead it is something that the whole world should have learned a great lesson from.

What makes me saddest of all is that in part Germany's WW2 guilt has stopped a lot of people from speaking out against it, sympathising with Jewish traditions, for example.

The entire thing is ass-backwards bullshit - WW2 was a time in which the German people went along with and en masse stood by while great atrocities were carried out against people. To use that as a justification to *not* act now is absolutely insane! That is simply what is happening again now - people are justifying crimes against humanity, the life-long physical and psychological scarring of these vulnerable people on the basis that it might harm society *as it stands*. It's all for fucking status quo. If anything was learned in the last century it should be that you *do not just let shit like this happen no matter what the consequences*.

If it destabilizes society then so fucking be it, it's a better outcome than having stood by and done nothing. It's better than slipping into the abyss where you no longer have a nation that is *worth* saving because of what you have allowed it to become.

A line was uttered in Norway regarding circumcision banning too. ""We can't be the first country to do it."" People want it to happen but who will be brave and take the first step? I had high hopes that Germany being such a great country would be the first domino that would cause change across Europe over the decades to come, but it seems it is not to be. It seems almost that the fact of Germany's history is almost a barrier to stop it happening, when everything else about Germany could see it done. A strong, progressive country that has a chance to alter the course of the future for billions of children who will otherwise suffer terribly.

If Germany doesn't take that first step, who else will? The current position of Germany holds some power and, with that, responsibility to do the right thing. Even in the face of some potential trouble it may cause.

I have to ask anyway - *specifically* what do you think would happen if it was totally criminalised and prosecutions began. What would happen in a week, a month, a year, or 10 years in your opinion? I can hardly think of a circumstance worse than what is happening now...

""Oh no, rape is done in private and victims suffer more that way - we should legalise rape and let people do it openly on the streets - then we can help the victims in case they need medical treatment, etc!""

It's complete nonsense - it's just a big fallacy that people keep repeating and it seems at first glance to be reasonable, but the entirely of human civilisation shows that it's not the case. And removing any sort of possibility of prosecution for rape *would* increase the occurrence of it.

FGM is a brilliant example too - it being illegal and made illegal in more countries recently has reduced occurrences of it and also social acceptability of it. Yes, it has driven the practise underground, but it has also meant that people don't speak openly about it and peer pressure to have it done reduces *massively*. Numbers are falling and one day we will be free of it. When *that* has happened no one would *dream* of suggesting the practise start again! The only reason these things perpetuate is because they already happen and because nothing is done to stop them.

Nothing short of making it illegal will change that, and as much as Egozid suggests we find another solution, unless they can present one then there is no reason to assume there *even is* another possible solution. Not everything has a nice simple easy solution that everyone will be happy with. It's a fallacy of the bleeding hearts that there is always another way that doesn't involve any negatives against anyone whatsoever.

You need a state-issued photo ID that proves you are 21 or older; in some states, the legal drinking age might still be 18 (e.g., I think that's the legal drinking age in Louisiana).  As an alternative, you can be a local who knows which stores will sell to teenagers or underage college students, or get a buddy who is 21 to buy for you, or pay a homeless guy to buy it.

&gt;Some advocates say all use is medicinal.

That's a fair point.

I will just state my point very simply and briefly.  I think marijuana should be legal.  If you get relief from it, great; you should be able to buy it like you can buy coffee or alcohol.  If, for a certain person, it is used solely to have a good time, that is fine with me, too; it is certainly safer than celebrating with booze, cigars, cocaine, or opiates.

&gt;I wonder who we're really trying to protect from what.

We're trying to protect the government, medical authorities, and all people who have taken a stance against marijuana due to their personal moral beliefs from having to admit a mistake.  Many of them sided with prohibition because of a ""yuck"" factor that people with Lutheran-derived morals feel about taking substances just to feel pleasure.

Arguably we are also protecting the police, prosecutors, and the prison industry from budget cuts, but I think the first explanation I gave is the main reason, since Americans have shown no hesitation to cut the government's budget in order to cut taxes, even when that has severely damaged large interest groups (e.g., education budget cuts which affect school employees, the parents of kids who go to public schools, and the industries that build and supply public schools, which are collectively probably bigger than the prison industry).",0,1346550858,null,0,false,0,c625if2,t3_z6i7y,t1_c625if2,t1_c62556q,null,1429794500,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

This cover was intended for the Spanish market, and in Spain American slavery is just a historical fact with no more emotional load than any other part of History where humans suffered at the hands of other humans (which is basically all of it).

I find that many Americans somehow believe their own racial sensitivities and taboos are relevant globally. This reminds me, for instance, of the [controversy surrounding the Australian KFC ad](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/jan/06/kfc-advertisement-accused-of-racism) where an Australian cricket fan surrounded by West Indian (i.e. Caribbean) fans makes friends by producing a bucket of fried chicken. Fried chicken has no racial connotations in Australia, and the black people didn't represent African Americans. However, Americans insisted on taking an egocentric view of the advertisement and considering it racist. This wasn't a mere misunderstanding to be resolved after it was explained that black people and fried chicken have no connection in Australia. Here's a ten minute clip of The Young Turks (an American political talk show) insisting that the ad was racist [even after having the whole issue explained](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_StDMpVhDk).

I don't know if this is due to the American population's relative cultural isolation from the rest of the developed World, making them fail to understand that other countries don't share their own social and historical wounds, or if it's due some kind of assumed cultural hegemony and a subconscious arrogant belief that American culture and norms must be applied everywhere. Maybe it's a bit of both.

In any case, don't be surprised that Australians and Spaniards take offence at Americans coming over and telling them such an such cultural or entertainment object aimed for their own internal market is intrinsically racist because it would be considered offensive in the US.

* I think that western countries should assimilate immigrants, like the US has done. US after all is a mono-culture. However the one unique thing about America is that it is country founded on idea, either you believe in the US constitution or you don't. In Europe we have defined our self's via language, religion, race, etc... If we want to assimilate immigrants, then we have more or less have to throw out at least race. In my opinion religion goes out too, as European societies are modern societies. So for example being Finnish becomes more a question of language, set of beliefs and values, patterns and models of actions, etc...
* I think that our western civilization is going on a transformation to being a global civilization, a global culture so to say. And as it spreads around the globe, the whole globe will start to look the same, however the values on which this global civilization is being founded are not old values of west, but values of modernity, capitalism, consumerism, individualism, etc.. Just look at our western societies, they are very much different than they were say 50 or 100 years ago, they have transformed much.

true,LurksOn1stDates,SLOV,Slovenia,"If you put aside what they did to the aborigines in the past, modern day Australia is probably the closest to the success multiculturalism can bring. Reasons why I think it works there:

* they have a highly selective immigration policy and bring in only the type of people they need - mostly highly skilled workers who are well educated and are therefore more likely to integrate into their socio-cultural environment better, more likely to find a job and support their family, less likely to end up resorting to crime

* they are relatively isolated from the rest of the world which makes it easier to control their borders for illegal immigrants

I think the major share of the blame for today's tensions between different cultures in Europe within nations lies with the post WWII governments. Their immigrant policies have been too lose and they were too naive in thinking they're just bringing in workforce instead of actual people (Germany being the prime example here). Furthermore, there has been no longterm vision with how they are going to integrate the immigrants. They built social housing and let the immigrants fill them up, not realizing they're basically ghettoizing them. How is a Turkish family in the 60's going to integrate into German society if all their neighbours in their block of flats are Turks? How is an Algerian family going to integrate into French society surrounded by Morrocans and Tunisians? The immigrants were offered all the benefits of the welfare state, but no terms of service. So when you're put in front of a choice of going back to Turkey and work for low wages or enjoy welfare benefits in the immigrant bubble in the middle of Germany, what do you pick?

Today, the discourse regarding multiculturalism revolves mostly around Islam and Muslim extremists, how Islam itself is a threat to European values and democracy. The ones who pull the short end of the straw here are not the imams in Pakistan, Iran or wherever calling for burnings of flags and killings of western imperialists, but the average Muslim immigrants in London, Marseille, Berlin, Stockholm, Copenhagen etc., who moved away in search of a better life, and in a lot of cases, to flee from the above mentioned aggressive retorics and oppressive regimes. There's no denying that a lot of criminal offenders come from an immigrant background, but you have to look at the context of things. They are being brought up in a secluded immigrant environment, go to schools that are predominantly filled with immigrants, most of them coming from a poor financial background. How are they supposed to fit in?

You suggest, that humans from different cultures eventually end up slaughter each other (you did not say this literally, I know). I'd like to have a discussion about multiculturalism, but with a different premise. First of all:

* what is a different cultural background? Language? There are countless countries with multiple official languages. Not all of them having a conflict with that. Religion? Protestant &amp; Catholic are living together peacefully in Germany, while there have been problems in Ireland. It is hard to say, when people are having a different culture. Spanish and French are having different cultures, but when they are together in a third country, they may find out, that they are pretty similar.

* What does living together mean? In Canada the French and English speaking population live in separate areas. In New York you will find all cultures of the world in a tiny area. How close do they have to be, that multiculturalism starts.

* How many of one culture are at one place ? Are there just two viewpoints crashing (with a rivalry who is the dominant one) or are there truly multiple cultures and everyone knows he belongs to a minority (e.g. New York)

true,Snoxhall,null,null,"I think your friend couldn't be more wrong. It is not good to compare parties by their name only. The German conservative (CDU) party is as leftist as the democrats in the US. They are in favour of high taxes (although not as high as demanded by other parties), a strong welfare state and regulation of markets and labour (again not as much as other parties). Imagine a situation where the democrats would be the ""rightist"" ones in the political spectrum.

To call the FDP libertarian might be true, but is very misleading if you omit the political situation in Germany. While they are generally in favour of lowering taxes and labour regulation, I don't think this can be compared to the situation in the US.

Your friend probably cited the ""Agenda 2010"" reforms that were enacted by the SPD (social democrats) in the early 2000s. Again I think he misunderstood the problems in Germany. The aim of these reforms was to make the huge German welfare state viable in the future, especially as Germany was not very competitive internationally at this time. While the merits of these reforms are (almost) undisputed, I would cite three eqally important points that helped Germany in this crisis:

1. At least since the 2000s the German unions agreed not to raise wages in Germany, basically a tradeoff that led to more less well paid jobs.

2. In the immediate aftermath of the banking crisis of 2007, there was a programm called Kurzarbeit (short work(ing hours)), where the government paid part of the wages of workers who otherwise would have been laid off because of a sudden drop in demand. After the global economy got started again, German companies could immendiatly fulfill demand (especially with exports to Asia), because they still had their qualified workers.

3. Often overlooked, Germany profited by the weakness of the other Euro countries. If Germany had had its own currency, the exchange rate would have skyrocketed and made exports much less likely (that's what happened to Switzerland). Lower exchange rates are vitally important to the German economy that is based on manufacturing and exports.

As this is already a long post here some short answers to your Questions:

What are the popular political movements in Germany?

At the moment we have 5 parties in the national parliament:

Die Linke (the left): basically socialist, i.e. high taxes, high regulation, maximum welfare state, strengthening of demand while ignoring deficits. Socially (gays, drugs etc. very liberal)

SPD (social democrats): basically the same as above while much less extreme. When in government almost no difference to the CDU.

Die Grünen (the greens): Originally an one issue party, now part of the establishment. In terms of economics similar to the CDU but concentrating on green business. Socially very liberal and outspoken. Privacy is very important. Originally anti-war.

CDU (conservative) and CSU (batshit crazy populist bavarians): medium taxes, medium regulation and supply based economic policies (i.e. German products have to be cheap, which means lower wages). Socially conservative (still against gay marriage etc.) 

FDP (liberals/libertarians): low taxes, low regulation, pro big business, pro ""wall street"". Socially rather liberal (they have forgotten about this though). Very little success at the moment.

The Pirates are emerging, but I am absolutely no expert on this, so maybe someone else can describe them.

Does Germany got a strong conservative and libertarian movement?

No. While CDU/CSU and FDP are in power at the moment, they are no movement like the Tea Party. Gladly.

Is that the key of Germanys sucess?

No. The success in Germany is based on the very things the Tea Party opposes. Government interference and stimuli. And many other reasons.

How are the other parties doing?

Quite good. Actually the FDP will perhaps not be represented in the next parliament.

What are their stances?

I tried to explain (poorly) above.

 Is there a general consenous among the population of what direction Germany should go? 

I think yes, but others may disagree. ""Right"" and ""Left"" in Germany are not arguing whether we should have Communism or unregulated Capitalism but whether the richest should pay 46% or 52% (again oversimplification). I think renewable energy, strong welfare state and participation in Europe are gerneral consensus, albeit there is a lot of disagreement on details.

TL;DR: No Tea Party in Germany. Almost every German party is the exact opposite of the Tea Party. No, the German success in the last years is built on the politics of the social democrats and sound measures during the banking crisis.

Now I am preparing for the incoming shitstorm of all the German redditors that I have angered. Sorry for the long reply.

Trust me, American cities are very diverse.  What you are noticing is the level of integration we've achieved, not an absence of cultural differences.

Also, you keep coming back to whites and blacks.  Yes, black Americans are locals and, with rare exceptions such as parts of Louisiana, they have basically the same culture as white Americans.  

When I think of multiculturalism in America, I think of Hispanics and Asians.  You are underestimating the number of Vietnamese in my city.  There are parts of downtown where all the street signs are in English and Vietnamese, and many of the store signs are only in Vietnamese.  Vietnamese people are one of the largest ethnic groups in Houston.  Hispanics, many of them from Mexico or central/south America, are the largest ethnic group.  There is a huge Mexican influence in Texas.

We don't have problems across ethnic groups at the same level as France does at this time.   Two decades ago, you would have been completely correct.  I can't say how France should deal with Muslim radicals; it's not my country and I'm not intimately familiar with the situation over there.

One thing I did realise, is that people tend to pronounce ""durch"" as some sort of /dujx/, with a really soft R which actually seems to turn into a semivocalic /j/.

However, these are just my impressions and you seem to know more than I do, so I might be (and probably am) quite wrong :P

true,Theemuts,NETH,The Netherlands,"The exact nuances are hard to explain, I have to agree with Zeurpiet on that, but I'll give a rough description of the current Dutch political climate.

Like most other countries, especially in Europe, there are quite some parties here (13 in total). The previous government consisted of the Liberty and Democracy Party (VVD) and the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA); the Freedom Party (PVV) tolerated this construction to reach a majority of seats in our House of Representatives.

The CDA has been one of the largest political parties here for many years. These last few years, their popularity has greatly decreased. The party is currently having an identity crisis.

A few months ago, when new austerity measured were discussed, the PVV decided to no longer tolerate the minority construction. Politicians often blame the PVV that this was in very bad taste and a move that hurt our economy. 

Some blame, however, is directed at the VVD because people fear that austerity will destroy the social safety net. Especially the Socialist Party (SP) is very vocal about this. During last week's debate, however, their party leader didn't perform too well, whereas the Labour Party's (PvdA) leader performed very well. After this debate, we saw a shift in the polls: the popularity of the SP decreased, the popularity of the PvdA increased.

true,Gro-Tsen,null,null,"First of all, you should be aware that we Europeans (or at any rate, we Frenchmen) do not ""date"" in the way Americans use the term.  What I mean by this is that there does not exist such a rigid set of social conventions about the process: so if you're American, and particularly if you're a heterosexual American male, you should beware of taking for granted such rules as ""guy is in charge"" or ""guy pays for the bill"" or ""on first date do &lt;this-or-that&gt;, do not do &lt;this-or-that&gt;"" — I'm not saying you should assume the contrary, either, I'm just saying you shouldn't assume too much (or worry too much).  Now maybe I'm just stating the obvious, and maybe you used the word ""date"" without any specific preconceptions, but it can't hurt to point this out: if other-person has lived in Paris for years and you're just visiting, it makes so much more sense for other-person to suggest where you should go to.

Second point: ""fun and different"" is very much in the eye of the beholder.  I've lived in Paris for 15 years (and within 30km of Paris for just about all my life), yet I've never been on top of the Eiffel tower, I've never been on top of the Arc de Triomphe, I've never been to the Musée d'Orsay, and I've been only a couple of times at the Louvre of the Invalides.  All precisely because *I live here* and it's the sort of things tourists do, but locals often do not, unless they're accompanying a tourist.  I really wouldn't mind going to the Eiffel tower with a friend who happens to be visiting Paris for the first time.  Maybe your friend would think the same thing[#].  It's impossible to say without further information.

Take a look at [this remarkable map of Paris](http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/4671584999/in/set-72157624209158632/): the places marked in red are where the tourists take pictures, the places marked in blue are where locals take pictures.  Now make up your mind as to whether you want to go to the ""red"" or the ""blue"" places. :-)

If you want to walk in a park (which would make sense because the weather will be sunny and warm this Tuesday), there are three I can recommend which are very nice and less banal than the Luxembourg / Parc Monceau / etc.  Namely: the Parc André Citroën (in the south-west of Paris, near métro Balard), the Jardins de Bercy / Yitzhak-Rabin (in the south-east, between métro Bercy and Cour Saint-Émilion) and the Parc Clichy-Batignolles / Martin Luther King (in the north-west near métro Brochant, not to be confused with the older square des Batignolles which is right next to it).  All three are modern parks, arranged in the 90's by talented urbanist gardeners, few tourists visit them (which is a shame, really), and even Parisians don't all know about them (even more of a shame).  The parc Clichy-Batignolles isn't fully completed yet, I think (but there's already a large part that is).  The Jardins de Bercy are also interesting in that they lead to Bercy-Village (at their south-east end), which is a small pedestrian ""village"", a sort of outdoor shopping mall with plenty of restaurants and a cinema.  The Parc André-Citroën is a sort of maze of colorful little sub-parks organized around a central lawn.

Also somewhat in the same style, there's the promenade plantée, which someone else mentions in this thread (that's not really a park, it's a ""planted walkway"" mostly above the avenue Daumesnil), and the parc de la Villette (in the north-east: rather similar to the three parks I mentioned, but more widely known).

I spent my weekdays in Montpellier, where I did my internship, but my weekends were mostly spent somewhere else in the region. 

To start, here are two helpful websites (in English): 
http://www.creme-de-languedoc.com/Languedoc/index.php
http://en.sunfrance.com/organize_your_stay/visitor_attractions

It's going to be HOT in September. Lots of sun, so bring lots of sunscreen and keep hydrated. Be ready to speak a lot of French, especially if you are not in a large city. What exactly are you looking on doing? City seeing, more outdoors type activities, sitting on the beach, experiencing the southern culture?

The region has a lot of different things to see and do. You can go to the numerous beaches, which the first link does a nice review of them. There's even the famous nudist one, Cap d'Adge, which you have to pay 5 euros to enter. I would say it's a most-do, as the beach is the nicest I've been to in the region and it was a cool experience. Languedoc-Roussillon is also the world's largest wine producing region in the world, so there are many, many vineyards. I would try to visit one - the wines are nice and the landscape around the vineyard is spectacular. There's a good amount to see in the larger cities - Montpellier, Sète, Perpignan, Carcassonne, Nîmes, Pézenas. You have to try the seafood in the area because it is damn good. There's also the ""tielle sétoise"" that you should try when in Sète. 

You should see their version of ""bullfighting."" It's not really bullfighting at all. There's a flower pinned on the bull and the person runs around and tries to take the flower off. Here's the link (it's in French): http://www.ffcc.info/

We have about 20 parties to vote for, the most important (roughly from left to right)
Socialist (SP), Animal (PvdD), Labour (PvdA), Green (GL), Reforming liberal (D'66), Centrist General Christian (CDA), Orthodox Protestant (CU), Liberal conservative (VVD), Orthodox Protestant Calvist (SGP), a merger between split offs from PVV and VVD (DPK) and extreme right (PVV) 

We have the line pro Europe (D'66), some Europe (VVD, CDA, PvdA, GL, CU), less Europe (SP), out of Europe PVV. 

We have the austerity line, very much (VVD), mostly so (D'66, CDA, CU, GL), not at all (PVV, SP).

I cannot even remember how the parties are with respect to medical costs, but everybody wants lower costs while keeping care level. This is clearly tied in with privatization, sometimes seen as solution for health care costs, sometimes as part of the cause. Writing this makes me realize I don't know half of it.

To get a working government, you need half of the votes. Probably this will need 3 to 5 parties to combine and agree on main lines and details. You cannot just combine the big parties, there are some frictions which preclude this

PVV hates everything on the left, especially PvdA.

PVV was big in the last election, but messed up. Bad choice of candidates, three groups have split off and begun own party. Broke the last government, which does not sit well with VVD and CDA which made the government. Many people saw this coming, so PVV won't be first choice for anybody. 

D'66 and SGP have so much disagreement, they won't be able to cooperate

VVD is fear mongering the SP, won't be able to cooperate easily. 

CDA has shrunken from big (largest or second largest) to 5th or 6th. They went from centrist to right wing the last couple of years and seem to want to be centrist again. They have to walk a fine line to keep the remaining voters and grow again. 

PvdA lost a lot of voters but seems to be regaining with a new leader. Still, they are being forced to show a good socialist face in order to keep voters from SP, while being centrist enough to play with VVD. VVD has the same with PVV. Show to be different and reasonable.

It's difficult to say. Last year was the 150th years anniversary of birth of Italy. In some towns (especially in Turin, Florence and Rome -former capitals and actual capital-) the emotional involvement was very high.. in some other parts of Italy it wasn't so. in this two years 2011/12 a lot of books about risorgimento were stamped. Very few of them were historically meaningful. Most of them were simply rubbish: written for a partisan audience they reflect italian people nowaday ""virtues"": passing the buck each other for contemporary problems, conspiracionist, generalized. In my experience: risorgimento is seen as an important phase of Italian history. some errors were made of course but the pros win against the cons.

&gt;What's your view of Mazzini, Cavour, Garibaldi et al?

1. Mazzini: a naive terrorist with good ideas. too rigid in his opinions maybe.

2. Cavour: he didn't want to unify whole Italy. however he was sure a good prime minister. He knew how the work has to be done. Too egocentric. useful.

3. Garibaldi: he was the italian virtue. loved by european public opinion. despite being a Republican he accepted to fight under the Savoy to unify Italy. Being only a soldier he wasn't a politician or a thinker. He management of Sicily during his dictatorship is the proof.



&gt;Do you view yourselves as a united nation these days?

Italians are not very patriotic or nationalist (which in my opinion is good).. maybe we feel more linked to the little homeland, to the town, to our own bell tower.. but Italy was yet considered one single nation since it was divided in little city-state and only fools think Italy should be divided.

Reading about your 6-month residence here, it will be difficult for you to get a company to connect your home. Do you have any flatmate? Maybe you can arrange something with him.

Also, about the Spanish ISPs...

- Jazztel: tradicional DSL2+ service, 30 MB. Crappy, not recommended. But they're the cheapest solution, and they don't lock you in a contract where you must be paying in the ISP for a fixed amount of time (normally is a year).

- Telefónica/Movistar: DSL2+ (10-30MB) and fiber service (50 MB and 100MB, the country's fastest). But totally not recommended, Movistar's customer service is just useless and they play with you and your money. Also, very expensive.

- ONO: 12-50 MB fiber, a bit expensive but their service is good. Your building has to be prepared to receive filter (almost every block in Barcelona is ready). No 1-year contract required, but if you accept it they give you 15 MB of free bandwidth.

it's a bit less cool. Well, saying that is not very helpful if your cruise company doesn't offer you to guide you to this island. You won't have the time to do it by your own means in 8 hours. If they propose you that, you should definitely do it. If not, well, too bad... But don't be disappointed, you will enjoy Toulon as well :)

So if you are by yourselves in downtown Toulon, you should just go in the city and visit. The Place de la Liberté is a nice area, you may enjoy to visit the cathedral and the old city. There are a lot of shops in the area. The harbor is nice too, if you're into military ships you will definitely enjoy it. Plus you can take a little train that will give you a tour of the city with comments. It won't rock you world but I think it's nice. Take your time to find a little restaurant and enjoy Provence cuisine. Another nice thing to do is to take the cable car wich will lead you to the Mont Faron. The mountain dominates the city and the view is amazing. Plus there is a WW2 memorial, celebrating the ally landing in Provence. And if the weather is good, well, the beach is always an option!

And in Portugal, minorities are not persecuted, true, but we have a huge problem with making them fit with the locals. This happened because of our older policies, which created huge ghettos and threw every minority there. Those places obviously became problematic spots spread around the country, where criminality and conflicts prevail. After this huge failure, we tried to integrate Romanians, Africans and other minorities. Another failure, since them refused to be integrated, because the felt unwanted outside their community. This is a very sensible issue right now, because as the crisis spreads to the middle-class, racist and xenophobic uproars start to become more frequent, a dangerous thing to any country, especially one that embraces so many different cultures. Blaming immigrants for the problems we created ourselves is childish, but a common thing for the growing far-right voices in the political stage.

Another problem with this suburbanization of minorities is that it decreases their chances of success in school and cripples their ability to find jobs.
