true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes, but taxation doesn't simply mean redistribution, it is not a one-way street taxing only the rich and giving it only to the poor. 

Sweden has high VAT (25%), really high income tax 57% on the average but not used for capital gains, which are taxed at a lower 30% rate. This sounds a whole lot like not really targeting the rich (who are interested in capital gains) hard but more like also taxing the middle-class hard and even the poor, the VAT through the purchases. These sounds like a balanced tax system, not a redistributive one?

Other stuff.

I have just got a co-op apartment in Vienna, Austria. The government paid about 20% of the building costs. This is about 2 years of my income tax back. I am not rich, not poor, typically middle-class. The apartment itself is typically middle-classy. This financing is available up to roughly upper-middle-class status, I could get promoted from my already fairly good job and still get it. Question: was the financing of this apartment a redistribution? I think not. I think Sweden has many such stuff as well.",0,1346341566,null,0,false,0,c60zfu3,t3_z1j4d,t1_c60zfu3,t1_c60z3tg,null,1429774336,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

First of all, you have to keep in mind that italian risorgimento is extremely peculiar in comparison to the rest of Europe's risorgimentos (many academics believe it should not even be referred to as risorgimento). Among the many factors of its peculiarity, one of the most important is that, unlike in other countries, in Italy we did not have the massive push provided by common people to the risorgimental cause. The whole thing was way driven from above (politicians and intellectuals instead of simple folks). This had severe ripercussions on the whole process, whose effects are still well alive today.

Thus said, the way risorgimento is taught in school is, not so surprisingly, very poor. What students are given is very often an oleography of this bygone era when a bunch of brave heroes fought for the greater good and everyone lived happily ever after. The complexities of this phenomenon are constantly overlooked by books and teachers, resulting in an awful lot of people who exit school confusingly knowing that Cavour and Garibaldi put Italy togehter and nothing more. 

As for seeing ourselves as a united nation these days, my answer is yes. Sure, we are the proud home of municipal chauvinism and the rivalries between towns, cities, regions are huge. Still, I'd say that our national feeling stands strong. Only, it stands strong thanks to events other than risorgimento. Think of how WW1 brought together for the first time in history italians from all over the country to fight and die side by side in order to defend this mysterious and unknown to many entity called ""homeland"".

He toppled a functioning (certainly not favourable or anything close to it) cabinet, simply because of a populist opinion and without regards for the position of The Netherlands in the Euro. 

The party with economic overlaps are the neo-liberals (VVD). Other center parties probably prefer socialist compromises over working with Wilders. However Wilders has shown that his party is willing to compromise on practically every single promise to their constituency, to the point of non-existence, simply to be in a position of power. Some parties might take advantage of this to come up with a similar solution as we had (It is not likely this will happen).

It was a gamble for him to step into the previous majority, because if this cabinet worked out, he might have continued on this success. Quite paradoxically he toppled the cabinet himself. After pulling stunts like opening a website to report Polish 'criminals', that came here because of the euro zone opening up. A foolish move that didn't sat right by his voters. (These voters I claim were ignorant to his right-extremism before this.)

Most of Wilders his votes were because of his populism, mostly the populism that fitted within the socialist egalitarianism mind-set of the Dutch. This and his anti-Muslim rhetoric. But since Muslims are not causing any issues and extremism is essentially non-existent in The Netherlands. Breivik happening in Norway, who saw Wilders as a big contributor to his ideals. The Arab Spring showing Muslims as people with the same ideals and dreams about freedom. He simply removed his anti-Muslim as a focal point, instead is now using anti-EU rhetoric in much the same way.

He starts to become quite transparent, his far-right extremism and fascistic ideals become more and more apparent. He hasn't achieved anything, he hasn't improved discussion, etc. He has become sort of a non-figure, which we grant some platform because of our politeness and hard to understand tolerance absurdum.

So, the probability is low. I'm actually kind of surprised that he still has this many votes. To my mind worrying. I for instance have to excuse myself here, when I call the PVV a fascist far-right extremism party. Even though the title describes what it is, people still treat this as 'my opinion'. But he is a charismatic leader, who does not have a democratic party, and he excludes a complete part of society (Muslims). With many more undeniable facets like nationalism as basis for his anti-EU sentiment. 

Thankfully [this link](http://www.destentor.nl/nieuws/algemeen/show/11604323/Wilders,-Hitler-en-Breivik-op-prent-Bennie-Jolink.ece) shows that we are not all fooled. You'll see Hitler, Wilders and Breivik painted by a Dutch Singer, who want to use it as a background for his concerts. Wilders was of course not amused.

true,Kit_Emmuorto,vaticano,,"The whole idea of risorgimento started spreading among the elites in the beginning of the 1820's, fueled by the greeks revolting against the ottoman empire. 

You have to consider that european intellectuals of the early XIX century had a mindset coming straight from the 700's culture, i.e. a culture whose cornerstone was a kind of feticism for everything classical. So, being Greece the cradle of everything classical, intellectuals from all around Europe felt the moral obligation of repaying this debt they felt to have towards Greece (which, said today, is a little funny). So, many people (including some italians as well) actually went to fight and die for the sake of greek independence. 

The events in Greece spread very quickly and set Europe on fire. That happened because the majority of european countries by then had already begun developing some kind of national self-awareness, which provided fertile ground to the risorgimental ideas to settle and grow. This did not happen for Italy, though. The reasons why are many, and they involve different factors. To summarize, people in MittelEurope and northern Europe (for example Norway, whose risorgimento is also quite peculiar) were more educated and urbanized. Also, they stood against one single hostile entity revolting against whom was, in the end, easier.

Italian people, on the other hand, were the opposite. Large sectors of population could not read (keep in mind that Italy has been endemically illiterate until the half of the XX century) and had no idea of what a nation even was. Also, those people were accustomed of things being the way they had always been, so many of them simply did not see any reason to change them. This was especially true in the south, where a widespread anti-northern, particolaristic sentiment was fueled by local rulers and by the church (which had huge influence on people and, more poignantly, had everything to lose from the unification, as we shall see). This led to grotesque events like [Pisacane's expedition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Pisacane) with the liberator ending up slughtered by the liberated.

Attention: not all happened because of how backwards the folks were. Intellectuals and elites played their part as well, by failing spectacularly to get in touch with the people and gain their support. Instead, they sided with the strongest player - i.e. the Savoia - in order to make it quick. This lead to a series of political mistakes - for example the way they dealt with Rome - which created a lot of unnecessarily bad aftermath.

As for today, there is a huge divide between North and South which, albeit shaped and fueled mainly by events in the XX century, has its roots in the risorgimento. At every local elections in the south, you are sure to come across some minor party which calls itself ""neo-borbonical party"" or something similar, and it has to mean something, hasn't it?

There has been a moderate amount written on the subject, most of it very damning.

In addition to that, the *market"" isn't exactly making things easier for southern Europe since it is not trusting the countries - a bad circle. I wish I could solve it.

My cousin live in the countryside. They have one bus/day, if you call ahead. So either you can get there, or go home......

Anyway, a perhaps somewhat naive question, but why haven't you called for reforms then? I'm being honest, that can't be changed by anyone but the Italians. The problem is not the new tax on fuel, the problem is that you have a shitty public transport system that the Italians haven't build out or reformed. Shouldn't the question be then - why haven't we done that and what can you do to change it? 

But was what the Italians thinking when you voted for Berlusconi, debt, tax evasion, non reforms etc. I mean, sometings got to give, don't you think? 120 % debt, that didn't come from nowhere, and Italians are not ignorant, you have a lot if brilliant economists. Why did you borrow money then? BBC calls your decade with Berlusconi the ""lost decade"". I mean, the fault is no ones but Italy's, I'm sorry to say.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; But is this prescription realistic? Spain was, in fact, running a fiscal surplus in the run-up to the crisis; everyone at the time thought they were being responsible. If there is a ""next time,"" they will likely learn from this and they will lean even harder against the boom. But will they know exactly how hard to push back? Can a parliament react swiftly and responsibly enough to actively manage the macroeconomy?

The crisis was making for long. When you are a middle sized country in Europe and you use most of the concrete in the continent, more than countries like Germany and France combined, then you know that there is a big bubble brewing. The thing is that in Spain politicians, business men, bankers and unions were all in bed, there was money for everybody, most probably knew that the boom would end, but few knew how far the economy had distorted itself.

&gt; I don't think so--this is, after all, why the politically independent central bank run by technocrats was invented!

Independent central bank wouldn't have prevented the boom. Lets say that Spain wasn't in the Euro, that it had its own currency, now what would have happened in 2000s...

* Dot.com crash and 9/11 would have happened, leading the Fed to flood global markets with cheap money
* Germany, France, Netherlands, Finland, etc... would have still had small recessions, leading the ECB to flood European markets with money.
* Pension funds and baby boomer's would still have had more money and time to spend, leading them to seek second homes from south.
* Spain would have been flooded by cheap loans denominated in foreign currencies.
* After the crash of 2008, people and companies indebted with foreign currency loans would have started to default due to increased loan costs, devaluation of Spanish currency would have crashed the economy as hard or even harder.
* IMF would have had to rescue not only Latvia, Lithuania and Hungary, but also Spain too because the Spanish central bank would have soon been speculated out of markets.

No. The only way to prevent crisis in Spain would have been that the state would have intervened and restricted the economy from over heating. Much could have achieved if the Cajas would have been regulated - do remember the saving banks originated banking crisis in the US.

Je me souviens m'être pris la tête avec un gusse de F.O. qui distribuait des tracts à la sortie de mon ancien travail.
Je lui bassinais que ce qu'il faisait était complètement débile pour l'environnement, en lui montrant les mecs qui balancaient ses papiers dans une poubelle toute proche sans l'avoir lu (poubelle qui dégueulait déja de ces tracts)

sa réponse : ""c'est du papier recyclé, ça détruit pas la nature""

J'ai pensé aux usines de retraitement de papier, aux machines utilisées, à l'énergie consommée, et je me suis retenu de l'insulter, préférant m'en aller devant sa bêtise (enfin, son ignorance) crasse.

Le fait est que, pour se donner bonne conscience, on affiche partout un joli logo vert marqué ""fabriqué à partir de papier recyclé"" ou bien je ne sais plus quel blabla expliquant que l'arbre qui a été coupé pour faire ce papier à vu un autre arbre replanté.
Ces boniments servant juste à laver l'honneur des publicitaires et autres imprimeurs de papier me font rire bien jaune. L'argument ""consommez green"" n'est ni plus ni moins qu'une nouvelle vague, un simple moule dans lequel doivent rentrer les vendeurs en toute sorte pour être ""politiquement et écologiquement corrects"", en tentant d'une manière tout à fait déguisée et fausse de se montrer interessés par l'avenir de notre pauvre planète qui se meurt.
De belles larmes de crocodiles de marchands de consommables, ne pensant finalement que par chiffre, que par C.A., que par (pour certains) CAC40 et actionnaires.
Toute l'énergie utilisée pour venir vomir dans nos boites ou sur nos voitures des promotions et des réclames, allant de la découpe de l'arbre jusqu'au camion livrant les prospectus, toute la pollution générée par cette chaîne de fabrication de l'envie de consommer PLUS, personne ne le voit. Pas plus que le cycle polluant de la fabrication d'un de ces produits de consommation.

Non, tout ce que l'on voit, c'est un joli logo vert en bas de page qui nous fait nous rappeler que ""ouf, le vendeur est éco-responsable""...

On baigne dans une hypocrisie de mauvais gout, une décadence consommatrice morbide.

No and no. The so called 'anarchists' are a way overhyped part of greek politics and culture. There are a few hundreds of them that are only seen when they trade blows and rocks with the riot police in major demonstrations. There used to be actual anarchists, remnants of the resistance against the military junta from the 70's (just like in most parts of Europe a few decades earlier); nowadays they are mostly police/political agent provocateurs and some misguided kids. The most harm they do is break a few store windows and cause everyone's bus to be late in downtown Athens. Everyone knows that, and the media themselves, even the right-wing outlets have stopped refering to them as ""anarchists"" years ago. They just call them ""the hooded ones"".

Anyway, there are all kinds on idiots in Greece, especially in politics. How does that make a nazi party less of an issue in your opinion?

true,zakk,ITAL,Italy,"&gt; Anyway, a perhaps somewhat naive question, but why haven't you called for reforms then?

In every program of every party who run in any election in the latest 25 years, reforms played a key role. Once in charge they always struggled to make the reforms we need, and in the end all parties (centre-left and centre-right) gave up. Man, we had a taxi driver revolt because the government wanted to sell more taxi licenses; and in the end no new taxi license were sold!

To make a reform someone has to lose some of their privileges, in Italy no-one wants to do that and we are very good at lobbying (very very powerful trade unions who often influence the political scene.)

&gt; I mean, the fault is no ones but Italy's, I'm sorry to say.

No, not all Italy is to blame! I blame the people who governed Italy in the last 25 year; and no, they are not direct expression of what the people want, democracy (maybe in Italy more than in other countries) is faulty in many ways.

&gt; * The answer given most often in interviews and in press reports as to why, despite demands made for commercial technology transfers and other unfair trade practices in China, US industry continues to invest heavily in China is that one cannot not be in China lest a competitor get a foothold. US high-tech firms seem willing to pay the price in technology transfers - in exchange for limited market access.

&gt; * Despite several years of high-level investment in China, however, survey data and press reports indicate that relatively few US companies are realizing profits or even a return on their investments in China.

&gt; * According to experts and executives interviewed for this study, the transfer of advanced US technology is the price of market access in China for US high-tech companies.

&gt; * Unless significant changes are made to China’s current investment regulations and import/export policies, US commercial technology transfers to China are likely to continue, potentially enhancing Chinese competitiveness in high-technology industry sectors such as aerospace and electronics. The US-China trade imbalance may continue to worsen in the short term as commercial offset demands and foreign-invested enterprise exports increase and in the long term as China’s plans to develop indigenous capabilities in both basic and advanced technology industries are implemented. 

Or [this article](http://economyincrisis.org/content/china-forcing-train-technology-transfer):

&gt; Since the early 1990s, China has been in development of a high-speed railway system in their country. In 2003 China abandoned efforts to independently build super-fast trains and instead entered into joint ventures with foreign companies to finish completion of the railway. Executives of the international companies involved, however, claim that China forced them to transfer their technology in order to gain access to the Chinese market. This is not the first in a series of claims in which manufacturers state that China forced the relinquishment of proprietary information before any contract would be signed.

&gt; He Huawu, chief engineer at the Ministry of Railways in China, did confirm that China’s trains are based on foreign technology, and greatly modified by Chinese engineers. He pretend though that the transfer of technology was not forced. 

&gt; [---]

&gt; A report released by The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said China was abusing the allure of its vast market to push foreign companies to transfer their latest technologies to Chinese competitors. This was a “blueprint for technology theft on a scale the world has never seen before,” it said.

The electoral success of Islamist parties is great. Now it's up to them how they are going to figure out how to place Islamic values (Sharia law) into the context of the modern world. 

We're hearing a lot of anti-rhetoric. But this is because there is now a real prospect of the Islamic countries uniting and forming a Union. They already share a language (Arabic) and Islam is the perfect ideology to accomplish this. With 1 billion people, they will have more power than the EU or US because they practically hold the worlds oil supply. And if they apply the Islamic banking rules, they will never have the financial problems like we are having. They will flourish, power to them.

If all these dictators weren't installed by the west, we probably would have had such a Union already.

So be careful when you read empty anti-Islamic propaganda, because the powers that be (Those who feed of this capitalist system today) know that [economic regulations in the Muslim world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_banking) will never allow for them to get the same foothold there. There is no gambling allowed for instance.

I'm not afraid of all this and I think the people will find solutions for the difficult problems they will face. Sure, we will not agree on everything. But I'm positive about the future for these states. Julian Assange, through wikileaks had the chance to talk to people involved in his talkshow ""The world tomorrow"". You might find it interesting.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, yes and no. I must say I am much more familiar with the Swedish banking crises than the Icelandic one, so forgive me any mistakes.

In Sweden, it was caused by a housing bubble, bad oversight of the banks and decades of overspending, bad deciscions on the governments part, etc. As usual, not just one single reason, even though I think the housing was the one that ""caused"" it. 

With regards to Iceland I wonder if they had any oversight, it seems not just bad oversight, but none at all.

Sweden didn't have to bail out all banks, but some of the biggest. SEB, our biggest bank, did not need to be bailed out.

Iceland, as far as I've understand, have had to bail out all three of their banks, and when I look at the amount of money, I once again wonder what sort of banking controls Iceland had - percentagewise is staggering, what have the banks been doing? I think it's the biggest collapse, ever. 

Sweden spent, in one year (it went on for 2-3 years) 4 % of our GDP, but we got collateral, shares, ownership, and in the end that turned out to be so profitable, so I actually think the Swedish government makes money out of it (they still own a large part of Nordea for example). 

That of course, remains to be seen for the Icelandic people, it's not immediate. The same goes for if they are going to change their banking system (we did) and the way they oversee their banks, change their policy/politics etc. A lot of good thing came out of it for us, and probably will for Iceland as well. 

The huge difference I was commenting on before that the Swedish government went in and made sure that all ""ordinary"" people who had money in the banks, would not loose it, up to a certain amount. We have that as a sort of bank guarantee as well. Also, we got no money from any other country, Swedes  paid for the Swedish banks.

The Icelandic people voted no to replace the money for the around half million people who had place their savings in Icesave, thus making 500 000 people loosing their money (honestly, pre crises a 5 % interest rate was not that big of a deal, they didn't know it was a pyramid scheme, it's not George Soros we are talking about here). Thus, UK and the Netherlands were *forced* to pay so that their citizens/organisations wouldn't be impoverished and loose their savings. Sweden didn't force any other country to do that.

On the other hand, I can understand the Icelandic people up to a point as well. The debt was enormous, and half a million people is more than the whole Icelandic population. However, I hardly think it's fair to stick someone else with the bill, one could at least start with some sort of plan etc. 

Also, perhaps it is a bit water under the bridge, but one of the reason Iceland could do this is that they are a small country, and UK and NL are reasonably well off. Had it been Bulgaria, the people would have just lost their saving (again). That is not how banks should operate, and Iceland is responsible for letting their banks run wild like a pyramid scheme, just like Germany is responsible for their banks, US for theirs, Sweden for theirs, etc. Thus, I hate that people take Iceland as an inspiration to ""stick it"" to the bankers (not Iceland's fault though). Most of the people in that mess were not bankers (and they have money in several banks and countries anyway), and the people who admire Iceland conveniently forget that they stuck UK/NL with a bill for 500 000 people (I know that they are starting to pay back, but still, it is a few years ago). If someone did the same to Spanish banks, it would probably 15 million ""ordinary people"" that needed to be bailed out, and I don't think Spain can do that. That said, I think the EU bank save is very, very, badly done.

Did I get anything wrong about the Icelandic bank save?

But to be honest with you, it's easy to get from city to city by either train or bus.  

I think all of the places mentioned elsewhere in this thread are great, but I would also add Cordoba to the list.  It's a small city but it's beautiful and I really like it there.

true,PointAndClick,NETH,The Netherlands,"Democracy is democracy. There is no 'European democracy', we don't apply a special sauce to democracy. You have elections and you fill the seats in parliament according to the votes. It's really simple. There is no difference between the democracy in Tunesia and the democracy in France. It's the same as calling an apple a European apple because it grew in Europe. It doesn't make it more or less of an apple.

To say that Muslims look at democracy differently is exactly this empty anti-rhetoric I was talking about. And then to say 'and increasing' it's also expressing this anti-Islamic empty rhetoric. The nazis also said that the Jews were planning on taking over the world, it's just hollow phrases that people throw into the world for you to worry about. 

25% Of the world population is Islamic. Are you really willing to say that one quarter of the human population is having a completely different view on what the perfect ideals and freedom look like? They want war, poverty, inequality, destroy human rights, kill their neighbours, eradicate all resources from the planet. What is it exactly that makes them soooo different that these differences are something that I should worry about in terms of compatibility? Seriously, what exactly?

I was the one who warned you for empty rhetoric and it was well aimed at you, because you don't see it even when it comes out of your own keyboard. You really have to come with some examples and fill this emptiness, otherwise you're just forwarding this right-wing bullshit without ever engaging in a meaningful debate.

This whole Wilders chapter in The Netherlands has made me way to educated about this issue. Because I want to have an opinion that is well informed. I found practically every of his anti-Islam arguments extremely shortsighted and to put bluntly: pure crap. Wilders agenda is a pure zionist one. He is dedicated to 'the struggle of Israel', all his ideology is aimed at this countries ability to continue its expansion. This includes portraying Muslims as terrorists, because this is remarkably helpful when dealing with mostly the Muslim Palestinians. That's where Wilders anti-Islamic ideology is born, not from any concern with the EU or The Netherlands. He really has something to fight for and his ideology is in his heart. In that sense I respect him more than the people who bought his ideas about the Eu being under some kind of threat from the Muslims. These people don't have a true ideology with true ideals, they are just getting swept up by a really smart game of a truly ideological driven leader. 

There never has been a real threat from Muslims for the EU, never has been, that's not where the ideology comes from. So I don't accept these empty words about a certain percentage of Muslims living here. And them somehow not understanding our democracy and that they are incapable of living here because of their believes. I don't accept that empty crap people are buying into. Quite on the contrary, all my reading about Muslims, their faith and engaging in debates with them has completely eradicated my fears. I now have a healthy respect for Muslims and the struggle for this respect is a much more honorable one than the struggle for eradicating Islam in Europe and hoping that 25% of the world will just be like ""no problem"".

Ma définition de l'art, c'est avant tout de créer une œuvre dont le but est de provoquer des émotions chez le spectateur, des émotions pures, pas un simple dégoût ou le fait de trouver pathétique un excès de vulgarité inutile.

People here is so obsessed by the WWII civil war occurred after Mussolini lost his power that everything else is almost ignored; all we talk about is Fascists and Communists.

&gt;How is the topic taught in Italy?

Poorly. It's just a boring collection of places, battles and names focused on showing how heroic we was and how evil our enemies were. Little to no in-depth examination of critical matters such as how we became a kingdom under a french minor aristocratic family (the Savoys), how the Church survived as an independent monarchy or why the newborn government chose to pillage the South and leave it behind basically letting the former Bourbons' vassals turn into nowadays Mafia.

So it can be a good indicator. But not necessarily. And we should not focus on Pisa. That being said. Good or bad education is not all in the money. What hurts American High School education is the focus on testing IMHO. Because a lot of money comes from good testing scores. But what is education for anyways. Other people could argue the purpose of education is doing good in standardized tests. This is absolutely debateble. 

Bottom line is we don't know which country has a better High School education. Personally I believe it mostly depends on the individual school and the individual teacher. No matter which country you are in. Except for the standardized test debacle. But that is not all about money, but rather how it got distributed and what was focused on, not about how much money was spent in total.

We both know that this is not the whole truth. While you can get a decent education at a German university (though it really lags behind the US), you can also get a decent education at any community college in the US for much less money. Also the top universites have extended scholarship programs that inlcude about 50% of their students or even more. So only a small portion of the students pay the full price. A lot get a full ride for academic excellence. I heard the top universities wouldn't even need to charge any money anymore. They got so rich through alumni donations, they could pay all their costs forever through interest. That would explain why they give out more and more full scholarschips for excellence.

Most systems have pro's and con's. For Finnish one, I'd say it gives very equal results everywhere. You can go to a rural public school and won't get significantly different results than if you'd go to a semi-private city school. Also, we do a lot to boost the people who do not perform so well. So, the ""worst students"" get decently educated as well. Many say the focus on equality reduces opportunities from the most gifted students, though I'm very sceptical about that.

true,Asyx,NRHW,"North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","I can't speak for the whole of Europe but at least in Germany, we've got a lot more possibilities in schools, universities and professions.

At first, there are 3 high school degrees. They are done on 3 different schools as well. You could say that those schools are for bad, medium and good pupils. So instead of always being a bad student because the stuff you learn is too hard for you or always being the best and bored, you can learn stuff in ways that are appropriated for you. Of course you can change the school to a lower one or higher one (the latter is pretty uncommon. You'd much rather upgrade your degree in your last year). 

Different jobs also require different degrees. A craftsman can find a job with the lowest high school degree and he only learnt the stuff he needs for those jobs. But more of that later. 

So after high school, there's college. College is like a high school (the highest high school does college degrees as well) in Germany but more focused on what you want to do as a profession which means that you can take courses that are actually useful. Or, if you already know what you want to do later in life, you can do industry focused degrees. I've done a computer science college degree which is probably the first 2 or 3 semesters in university. So college allows you to do better jobs as well. 

And finally for the academic part: Universities! We've got 2 big kinds of universities. The normal university which is focused on research and theory (so basically how to create new stuff) and requires the college degree you've done at a high school (it's called Abitur) and the university of applied science which is focused on the industry and how to use existing stuff. So that's the end about your education. But what if you don't want to study?

After every school degree, you could do a professional education. That's a degree for one profession made at a company (mostly. I've done mine with my college degree at a college) with marks (grades in the US?) and everything. You also get paid while doing this. 

So the main difference is that you've got a lot mor variety in Germany and the possibility to get a higher education (or being a professional of some sort) without being good in school. You don't have to deal with the academic stuff. You can do your 10 years of primary and high school and then do whatever job you like or decide to get 1 step further into college or even university. 

We Germans love paper and credentials. A professional education is worth more than any kind of working experience just because you can proof your skills with a degree instead of 5 lines on a CV.  Those separating has the advantage that you've got comparable degrees and pupils learn on their own pace and can easier be supported or challenged since the differences between pupils in classes are not as big as they could be on a high school. 

But I think two aspects are also very important. European countries are small. We are used to look outside. Half an hour by train and I am in the Netherlands. Other language, other culture, other everything. But not a lot of people. It is very easy for those people to get in touch with other cultures and learn from them just because they are in your WoW guild or stuff like that. So in the same way you learn about other states from people you meat on the Internet, so do we about other countries and from other countries and that stuff is mostly what people see as an obvious difference. It's not always the education system. 

Little example: American talk show with stupid (she was a bit dumb) blonde American moderator. 2 Brits (the crazy emo guy from IT crowd) were guests. She was talking about how she never knew how close some island state was (I think it was puerto rico) and that she thinks it's kind of hard to remember the location of some countries and those Brits were just like ""meh"" and she was like "":o you don't think so? Why is it easy for you"" and the Brits again ""Because we were schooled in England"". I mean you don't have to learn such things in school. It's easy to learn those kind of things just by talking to people over the Internet but since you Americans are everywhere and never had to look across your borders, you probably don't care as much as we do. 

Everything I've said about school might not be accurate outside of north Rhine Westphalia since education is state business and not federal business. 

I also don't know what European countries have professional education or how it works there with school and stuff. I know that the British (or only English) are doing professional education on demand and I also know that the general steps 

Primary school -&gt; High school (or secondary school with sixth form if I remember correctly. That would be like then German Abitur) -&gt; college -&gt; university

Are the same. 

Professional education opinion other European countries for Germans who emmigrate is like instant job and promotion. At least in South European countries like Spain. 

**tl;dr or for people who think it's too confusing because they don't know the education system in general here: More variety for everybody and appropriated difficulty level and teaching methods for everybody because of separation of pupils and possibilities to get proper credentials and degrees apart from Bachelor or Master which allows you to give comparable information about your skill level. Also, Europe is full of small countries. We're used to get in touch with other cultures and just care more by default which results in better knowledge (or more spread knowledge which then looks like better knowledge until you ask the right questions) geographically or culturally which is the obvious deficit Americans like to show when they ask Germans if they'd know Hitler or something similar ridiculous.** ",0,1346399987,null,0,1346404490,0,c61d81i,t3_z4h9z,t1_c61d81i,t3_z4h9z,null,1429780898,19,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,19

The only thing you possibly could have learned from this is how you can input expressions on a calculator, there was no asking why you couldn't evaluate some expression or any question that had multiple solution steps you had to figure out yourself. It was just input -&gt; look at result -&gt; cross off the appropriate box.

In Germany you wouldn't have prefabricated answers and solutions to the problems would have had multiple steps. Often the problem would be part of a bigger problem where you need a certain technique (root/plotting/etc) along the way. At least there was usually some kind of thinking involved in getting the results. Also if it was too easy when using a calculator, calculators would often not be allowed in exams.

true,cactuscat,null,null,"People like to generalise too much and this is far too complex a subject for that. Overall, I don't think the British education system is that good, but it seems to be thought so by others...I haven't been to school elsewhere so I guess I can't really say.

In the UK we have good schools and bad schools. We have state schools (which can be good or bad) and we have private schools. We also still have a few grammar schools - these schools are state funded, but only admit those who score well on an entrance test. A lot of private schools are selective too. There are also special schools for handicapped kids.

I think when foreigners think of British schools, they think of the private schools, which are good, but they also only take the best students anyway. They don't think of the state school on a council estate where a child can spend four years there and learn nothing at all because the teachers don't care, their parents don't care, and no one will stop the bullying or help them with their homework.

 The top universities here are good of course, they work their students hard and also admit only the very best. Then lower down the stack, entrance requirements are more lax and the courses probably easier. I'm not sure that the quality is necessary less, but the demand for places and reputation seems to be less, hence easier admissions. I went to a 'good' university and a friend of mine went to the 'lesser' university in our local area, for the same subject area. Now, I don't know that there is a difference in what we learned and our abilities now. We both got decent jobs. He had more problems with foreign students with poor English language skills but beside that his course had things I would have loved to have included in mine. On the other hand, my course did include more theoretical and academic stuff.

Much of a university's standing seems based on research, which is less important to an undergraduate as far as I can tell (maybe it depends on subject). Considering subjects, some universities are better for some subjects than others, their different departments seem quite independent. 

One big difference in the UK is that we specialise early. At 16 you choose A level subjects, and you study 3-5 subjects in greater detail, ignoring the rest. When you go to university you typically specialise on one subject, although there are many 'joint' degrees where you study two. Of course, there are exceptions. The problem with this is that you have computer science graduates, who got a first (top result) but can't write properly and know nothing about other areas. I think it would be nice to have a broader education in the first year or two of university.

true,Skulder,DENK,Denmark,"I think maybe /r/Teachers or /r/teaching would be a good place to go with this, but I'll try to do what I can here.

I'll try to do a mini AM(a)A here - I'm a Danish teacher.

Teachers college took four years - it wasn't that hard, and although a lot washed out, even more people made it through. Teaching is not an honourable or prestigious job. (The salary isn't awesome either).

Apart from general didactics, psychology and suchlike, I spent two years learning how to teach English, and two years learning how to teach Physics and Chemistry.

In my different employments, I have also taught Biology (7. grade.), Geography (9. grade.) and math (7. and 8. grade).

I can talk about what demands I have to live up to, I can talk about what resources are available to me, and I can talk about how I measure what the student's capable of. 

Ask if you have any questions.

And then I'd like to talk about math.

A written math exam will typically be 4 hours - the students are given one folder with 50 mathematical problems, consisting of the basic four, powers, roots, four or five different percentage-problems, some trig, a single piece of algebra, etc., and the students are given one hour to do this.

These first ones are easy to grade, as they're either wrong or right - they're somewhat like the scantron in that respect.

The other half, which the last three hours used for, are problems.

Typically it's 6 pages of problems, with a theme for each page, and 4-8 questions pr. page.

The theme could be ""Travel"" - I think the 2008 sheet had one where you were given:;

* costs for a car - ownership costs pr. day, expenses pr mile, and mileage + the price of gas.

Then you were told about the Family (mom(42), dad(39), son(12), daughter(3).

An insert of the page contains the prices for train tickets, explaining that it's 50% off for all children under 5, that 1. class is 50% extra, except for seniors which are 30% extra, and that budget travveling is also available at [other price]

A little map is inserted in the corner, and the distance by road from [city1] to [city2] is written there as well.

The questions, then, are very simple. What will it cost the family to travel between the two cities, how much more expensive would it be to travel 1. Class, which is faster, train or car, how much do pensioners save by travelling 1. class, compared to other people, etc.

When I look at the answers, I check 4 things:

* have the student shown that he has gathered all relevant data to make the calculation

* has the student planned out the calculation

* Is the student able to actually make the calculation

* Is the result correct.

These are weighted more or less evenly.  - anyone just writing down the correct results will get 25% correct.

Anyone getting all the results wrong because of a simple mistake, while having done everything else correctly, can still get 75%.

It's done this way because comprehension is seen as more valuable than learning, in the Danish school system.",0,1346405013,null,0,false,0,c61drr4,t3_z4h9z,t1_c61drr4,t3_z4h9z,null,1429781224,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

Please spare me the nationalist rhetoric. The ""educational system"" is not only made up of universities, so please don't accuse me of cherry picking, when you're doing it yourself.

Also, a few great students who study abroad do not make a good educational system. The average level is what defines the system, not the top 1%.

Take for example the international PISA tests. Romanians have below average scores. Check for yourself: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa_test#2009

And that our austerity measures will not be as hard-lined as is expected from us by the EU nations. There is a slight possibility of a ripple-effect through Europe. There also is however, a fine for this behavior to discourage moving away from the agreements. The SP leader has made a bit of a stupid remark 'over my dead body' when asked about that fine. Even though his argument was a lot more subtle, that remark has been picked up and he is portrayed as anti-EU because of that.

His argument was such that he acknowledges the difference between the southern European states and the nordic European states in terms of economic situation. That our solidarity with the southern countries should not be measured simply by our willingness to destroy our economy through austerity measures. (The left economic ideas lean heavily on spending capabilities of the middle class, they want to boost this instead of placing austerity measures on them. They see the spending capabilities as a long term solution and austerity as a short term solution which does more harm than good when not necessary). We can deal with the fine, when we can deal with the fine, but 'over his dead body' that he is going to bullied by this EU agreement. Things has changed since that agreement was made. That was the line of his argument, it's not verbatim.

So in terms of Europe, when we succeed with putting into place this (far-)left party, other countries might follow the example. This is kind of the fear underlying the anti-rhetoric. For as far as I understand it. He's certainly not anti-Europe in a sense that they want out, but Europe is clashing with his socialist economic agenda.

true,multubunu,ROMA,România,"&gt;a few great students who study abroad do not make a good educational system. The average level is what defines the system, not the top 1%.

I have always found that the Romanian school system is geared towards top students at the expense of average students. I have been watching this evolve ever since the early seventies when I started primary school. For instance, I learned of sets in fifth grade, but a couple of years later sets were taught in first grade.

I have an engineering degree (Bucharest), school was very heavy on Maths and Physics but we only had three practical design tests in the whole five years... Folks at Architecture had 12 per semester. I think this illustrates that an otherwise technical school was set up for producing scientists not engineers.

I suppose this tendency has roots in the Soviet teaching system but has gone wrong at some point. For instance there used to be a college degree (subingineri) which should have taken the majority of students (and fed the factories), with a couple percent going to the full degree (equivalent to a MS, intended for research institutes and such), but in the '80s hardly 15% of the students took the lesser degree.

Wherever GD goes there are cameras with reporters hoping they will do something 'extreme' so they can make a big article. However GD is behaving 'good' just because they are constantly under watch. Whatever they do, there will be a camera to record it. So far, they haven't given any major reasons to make the news. That of course does not stop journalists to become 'writers' and create stories. For example, lately they have been using the Iraq immigrant murder case a lot. According to the police, this murder is drug related and has nothing to do with racist motives. Most of the cases you hear on the news labeled as racist attacks are solved by the Greek police. Of course you never hear about the conclusion of these cases. They all turn out to be crimes unrelated to racism and GD. Most of the times are clashes between immigrant gangs. I guess you do not hear that in the news. Yes, often immigrant gangs clash with each other over here. It is not exactly the poor, helpless immigrants picture that the news articles paint. Of course there are very nice and hard working people amongst them but it is easy to see that for many of them their profession of choice is...well... crime! That is not very hard to imagine as Greece has been in a very bad state for the last years. Only a crazy person would come to Greece (over 20% unemployment) 'for a better future'. 

So yes, the article is far from the truth. It is based on rumors and is full of unconfirmed news. If there were GD members patrolling the cities with torches and flags you would definitely see it on video. It is ridiculous to claim so many crimes from GD and never have any proof. Never a cell-phone to take a picture. A passer-by as a witness. My city (not Athens) is full of illegal immigrants and I do not see them scared. They are everywhere, without anyone attacking them.

true,DepravedLibertine,FINL,Finland,"I don't have any experience of the Romanian system or the Swedish one but I have experience of the Finnish system and French system a little. In Finland you have to apply to get to university so it's not a free for all but otherwise it's probably pretty close to the Swedish one. In France I studied at a engineering grand école. The grands écoles are universities that choose their students through tests unlike universities in the regular university network, and they are somewhat elitist.

How I perceived the French system was that it did indeed demand a lot more work than the Finnish system. In Finland the beginner level courses tend to be almost trivially easy to pass. The philosophy is however that a student is there to civilize them selves and it is up to them to aspire to greater knowledge than the bare minimum, even if that's enough to get a degree. As you one's studies progress more is expected and in the end one is expected to produce scientific text of a very high standard.  In France the students were studying hard and the examinations were very difficult. The students were learning difficult math very early in their studies. However, being made to work as hard as possible isn't necessarily the best possible education.

I think the Finnish system is more economical with the students time in the beginning. Maybe a bit too lax at times, but it teaches the important lessons and as a result Finnish engineers are absolutely no worse than the french. Conventional logic would suggest that working as hard as possible get's the best results always. But the Finnish system has shown otherwise. Our results in primary school are just as good as the east-asian fascist parenting systems with the least schools hours in the world pretty much.

Bright people in universities don't necessarily need to be worked to death to reach their potential.

De mon humble avis je pense que reddit ne sera jamais adopté en masse par les français. Tous d’abord, comme il a été remarqué précédemment, le français moyen ne comprend pas assez bien l'anglais pour apprécier le contenu de reddit. De plus Reddit étant principalement un agrégateur de lien, l’utilisateur est à première vus moins a même de trouvé ce qu’il l’intéresse.
Dans un second temps j’ajouterai que l'internaute moyen n'est pas très friand de ce genre d'interface (ce qui est valable aussi pour 4chan qui au premier abord agresse les yeux). 
En revanche corriger moi si je me trompe mais la majeur parti des internaute français ou bien même européen sont plus à même d’apprécier le contenu médiocre de 9gag ou n'importe quelle image board car il n'y que des images d'accès facile a partager.  De plus ces sites paressent assez ""uderground"" pour passer pour un super hipe g33k sur facebook.
Pour finir j'ajouterai que majoritairement le jeune internaute français aime passer son temps sur youtube, 9gag, facebook, jeuxvidéo.com, trollface.fr pour la facilité d'accès au contenu de ces sites.
Pour ma part je trouve sa bien que la majeur parti des internautes soient contenu sur ces quelques sites car brièvement je trouve que se sont des communautés pauvre et médiocre.



**TL;DR :** L'internaute français aime le contenu facile d'accès et ne sont pas à l’aise avec l’anglais. L’internaute est apparemment satisfait du contenu sur ces sites favoris : youtube, jeuxvidéo.com, facebook , 9gag, instagram… Ce qui est toutefois pas un mauvais point, car Reddit restera ""safe"" (ou partiellement) des communauté française médiocre ou troll qui abonde sur le net.

hmmm, first I thought 'regulation' is a name for a legislative act. but this is a comission regulation, so indeed no vote in the parliament on it directly. here it is:

http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:076:0003:0016:EN:PDF

hmm, so it is a regulation based on Directive 2005/32/EC , that was voted on by the parliament. This is common practice, for the detailed implementation of a law to be left to the government.

in any case, this is the text as quoted or paraphrased in the comission regulation that the parliament and council apparently did approve:

&gt; ecodesign requirements shall be set by the Commission for energy using products representing significant volumes of sales and trades, having significant environmental impact and presenting significant potential for improvement in terms of their environmental impact without entailing excessive costs. 

... which seems like a perfectly clear mandate to the Commission precisely to make such decisions as this one, and phasing out the inefficient old lightbulbs.

seems pretty well thought through too:

&gt; The Commission has carried out a preparatory study which analysed the technical, environmental and economic aspects of lighting products typically used in households. The study has been developed together with stakeholders and interested parties from the Community and third countries, and the results have been made publicly available on the EUROPA website of the
Commission.

&gt; The annual electricity consumption related to products subject to this Regulation in the Community has been
estimated to be 112 TWh in 2007, corresponding to 45 Mt CO2 emissions. Without taking specific measures, the consumption is predicted to increase to 135 TWh in 2020. The preparatory studies showed that electricity consumption of products subject to this
Regulation can be significantly reduced.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Thanks for posting this. I would guess the reason is that most schools are funded by local property taxes. Combine that with the de facto segregation in most neighborhoods and the wealth gap that persists between blacks and whites, and the disparity between black and white students starts to make sense. Integrated neighborhoods exist, but they are the minority. In most cases neighborhoods are divided by class and race/ethnicity. 

Public schools in predominantly white neighborhoods are often well funded, and they use that extra money to hire the best teachers, build out their extra-curricular programs, offer additional AP classes. (This was my experience in a wealthy suburb outside of Philadelphia. I think we had 3 black kids in our entire school.) 

Alternatively white students in areas with under-performing public schools just go to private schools. My Aunt lives in a predominantly white neighborhood across the street from a public school. None of the kids from the neighborhood go there. It's a predominantly Black school. All the white kids go to Catholic school in another neighborhood. The black students literally walk several blocks into a white neighborhood to go to school. There isn't a lot of racial tension. People are generally very comfortable with each other, but it still seems pretty weird to me.  

Wealthier black kids go to private schools, or their parents move to districts with good public schools (just like their white counterparts.) This leaves low-income black kids with inner city public schools and white kids with under-funded rural districts. They have to deal with more social problems (poverty, absenteeism, counseling, violence). 

Even the districts that are well funded struggle to deal with all the social problems that begin at home. There are also cultural problems that the Black community faces more often then their white counter-parts: higher incarceration rates, poverty, more single mothers, a belief that doing well in school makes you an Uncle Tom, a lack of family support when it comes to education, a lack of information about early child development/reading/discipline styles etc. All of these things can make it more difficult to teach in a predominantly black school. My cousin tried teaching in an inner city public school, and the kids *and teachers* made her life a living hell...because she was white. The other black teachers didn't want her there, and they provided no support. She also told me some heartbreaking stories about the kids. One kid came to school and his backpack was filled with cockroaches. She had to take him out in the hallway to clean it out without letting the other students see. She's not at an integrated private school, and she's very happy. 

It's common for new teachers to start in these schools and then move on as soon as they gain experience. That's probably another reason for the disparity. Experienced teachers go to wealthier districts/private schools where they have more resources/higher salaries/less social problems. 

It sounds very bleak, but we've actually made a lot of progress on a number of these issues. There have been extensive reforms, a push for charter schools. Things are improving for inner-city students, but I'm not sure it will ever really be equal. In that same city, my college roommate went to a magnet school in the public school system. It was entirely racially integrated, and they achieved very good results.

I feel like a lot of the problems that we face in the US comes from our tendency to shy away from collective solutions. We are still very divided and we don't trust anything to happen at the National level...even instituting reforms at the State level would make people wary. Education is local, and people are afraid to change. 

tldr: Everyone says they want equality, but at the same time they don't want our local schools to have to sacrifice funding, and they don't want to pay more taxes.

Countries like Switzerland and Norway have to implement EU laws as the EU is their biggest trading partner, but have no say in how the actual legislation is created or written since they are outside. Switzerland is particularly interesting in that it has a lot of agreements with the EU, but with a clause that says that should either party reject any legislation that they pushes forward with, all treaties would be cancelled at the will of either party. Some believe this is why Switzerland joined Schengen, whereas it is quite an isolationist society.

It gives some info on immigrant populations in Europe, but it's not necessarily comprehensive. It does show that the US has an average number of dis-advantaged students. We have the 6th 
highest share of students with an immigrant background among oecd countries. however, the share of students 
with an immigrant background explains just 3% of the performance variation between countries. among the 8 
oecd countries that have between 15% and 30% of students with an immigrant background, which includes 
the united States, four show a smaller performance gap for immigrants on PiSa while three show a larger 
performance gap for immigrants than the United States. [29]

[PISA SCORES 2009 different US ethnicities.](http://www.vdare.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/fullsize/images/James_Fulford/121910_ss001c.png)

* This is a pretty controversial chart. I'm not sure how I feel about it. Either it reveals an intense and consistent bias in the PISA testing, or it reveals an intense and rather consistent disparity among American students by ancestry. I haven't really been able to find a similar breakdown of the student populations in other countries.

----------------------

I found some other info below, but it's not well sourced. You can argue with the bloggers conclusions because they don't really line up, but the data is still interesting (assuming it's accurate.)

[**Mean gap between immigrant students and native students**](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-EMpadQx4hM/TRKZ5kB-49I/AAAAAAAAAY8/c_2n4vdbkPk/s1600/immigrant.jpg)

&gt;Australia is the only country with a negative gap, which means Australian immigrants actually score better than natives. Canada is similar. The Australian-Canadian skill based migration system is at work here, generating less inequality (even short term). 

&gt;The other pattern appears to be that the gap is almost constant in the remaining Western European countries. This may be important to keep in mind, whenever people claim that uniquely Swedish policies are causing poor immigrant educational outcomes.

-----------------

&gt;According to the OECD, the United States spends about 50% more per pupil than the average for Western Europe, and 40% more than Japan.

(I imagine this is because of our emphasis on after-school programs/athletics and counseling/social spending that's not really handled by school districts in other countries?) 

---------------

&gt;The simplest thing to do in order to get an apples-to-apples comparison is to at least correct for demography and cultural background. For instance, Finland scores the best of any European country. However first and second generation immigrant students in Finland do not outperform native Swedish, and score 50 points below native Finns.

&gt;The problem is that different countries have different share of immigrants. Sweden in 2009 PISA data had 17%, and Finland 4%. It’s just not fair to the Swedish public school system to demand that they must produce the same outcome, when Sweden has many more disadvantaged students. 

&gt;Similarly schools with African-American students who are plagued by racism, discrimination, crime, broken homes, poverty and other social problems are not necessarily worse just because their students don’t achieve the same results as affluent suburbs of Chicago. In fact, the most reliable data I have seen suggests that American minority schools on average have slightly more money than white schools. It’s just that the social problems they face are too much to overcome for the schools. It is illogical to blame the public school system for things out of its hands. 

I'm not sure it's fair to assume immigrants in Sweden are disadvantaged. We would probably have to look into the demographics to really understand that picture.

[The amazing truth about PISA scores: USA beats Western Europe, ties with Asia.](http://super-economy.blogspot.com/2010/12/amazing-truth-about-pisa-scores-usa.html)

This makes sense, but it also sounds too easy. I bet there's still more going on in terms of funding in American schools. De facto segregation by class and race has to have some affect even if we correct the financial differences. I also don't think it's right to just exclude Black students as if they were equal to an immigrant population. I'm not comfortable letting only white Americans represent America's educational system on the world stage. That kind of thing is really problematic. This is the problem with using test scores to judge these matters. It's so easy to make assumptions based on the numbers, when the reality is much more complicated.

I know that there were/are legitimate banks, but they behaved like a pyramide scheme, they obviously had no cover what so ever for the what they promised and couldn't even pay the money to the ordinary person. It wasn't, of course, a pyramide scheme in the Madoff sense, and I never ment to imply that, sorry. *But*, it was the biggest banking collapse in the world, relative to Icelands size, so it was not an ordinary casualty of the 2008 financial crises, which you are implying, not in any sense. 

Also, if I understand it correctly, all three of the Icelandic banks were affected, which was not a ""normal"" reaction to the financial crises  of 2008, not by any means. Sweden haven't had to bail out any banks, neither has (to my knowledge) Finland and Norway (I think Denmark let one fail, and *might* have bailed out one or two, but I'll let a Dane correct me about that). 

&gt;was there even any control?"".

By that I don't mean to imply that there were *no* control, of course not, but mainly that is might as well have been non existing, if one considered what happened. That is a legitimate question, in particular with regards to the size of the collapse (percentagewise of course). Since you seem to be quite on the edge, I can inform you that people are asking that on a daily basis, with regards to the LIBOR scandal Madoff, and a lot of other banking scandals (or just financial scandals, Enron comes to mind). 

And, if I have understood it correctly (I've checked it now, against Wiki, so my memory has served me right - [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932012_Icelandic_financial_crisis)), Iceland had deragulated its banks in 2001. And, one does not have to be a financial wizard to come to the conclusion that whatever controls that Iceland had, they were not sufficient, and the obviously didn't work. Hence my comment, ""was there even any control"". Honestly, I was a horrendous crash, and I do not see why that comment upsets you so much. 


And, I know what the referendum was about. However, what was left after the referendum was a bill to *the UK and the Dutch* who in no way caused this. Yes, I know that Iceland is paying it off *now*, but that is years afterwards. At the end of the day, the Dutch and the UK was stuck with a bill through no fault of their own, or let the people with money in Icesave, loose their savings.

Just as an example. This morning I did a small shopping and I bought:

3 kg of tomatoes (for salmorejo)  
1/2 kg grapes  
1/2 kg red prunes  
1/2 kg prunes (some other type, don't know how to translate). It was all around 6 euros.

During this summer I've been doing the shopping for my family here in Cadiz and we had to get a lot of fruit and vegetables. Think of 8 adults + 5 children, vegetables and fruits for a few days, I'd spend around 25-30 euros each trip to the grocery store.

Whenever I shop for myself in a supermarket I get food for approximately 2 weeks allowing myself a couple of small luxuries and such and I usually spend about 40-50 euros.

500 euros per month to spend outside rent is enough to live by and allow yourself some luxuries. Don't rule out clubbing so quickly!

Enjoy Madrid. I did but I got fed up with it and I'm currently in Sevilla. I'll be going up there some weekend in October, still haven't decided exactly when, to visit old friends and such.

&gt;[Deviations from the trend line suggest that moderate spending per student 
cannot automatically be equated with poor performance by education systems. 
Spending per student between the ages of six and 15 years in the Czech Republic 
is roughly one-third of, and in Korea roughly one-half of, spending levels in the 
United States, but while both the Czech Republic and Korea are among the top 
ten performers in PISA, the United States performs below the OECD average. 
Similarly, Spain and the United States perform almost equally well, but while 
**the United States spends roughly USD 80 000 per student between the ages 
of six and 15 years, in Spain this ﬁgure is merely USD 47 000.** Countries that 
perform signiﬁcantly higher than would be expected from their spending per student alone include Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, 
Japan, Korea and the Netherlands. Countries that perform signiﬁcantly below 
the level of performance predicted from spending per student include Greece, 
Italy, Mexico, Norway, Portugal, Spain and the United States. In summary, the

prerequisite for the provision of high-quality education, spending alone is not

The Navigo Découverte was created because people complained that there was no anonymity and the transport companies knew exactly where you had been every time you used your pass. So they made an anonymous version of it. And it is available to anyone, whether they live in Paris or not. The downside is that if you lose a Navigo Découverte pass with a monthly subscription on it, all you can do is buy it again.

~~Also, for the people who use Navigo passes to get to work, the Découverte one doesn't give access to the 50% refund by the employer. But I guess that's not a problem for you.~~

So if you're only staying for 3 months, I'd suggest the découverte one, as it will be much easier and faster to get. It will cost you 5€ to get the pass though, while the other one is free.

Anyway, regarding their fiscal deficit, they are transferring something like 9% of their GDP to other regions which will of course make it hard to close the deficit.

The sad thing that I find is that, pretty much anyone whos had an education knows of Ireland. Sure some people think its still in the UK or speaks Irish as a first language - but everyone knows our country.
In Europe, hundreds of millions do not know of Catalonia. Its a nation with a rich history and a vibrant, living language. I'll get slated for this but its more of a nation than Ireland will probably ever be.
 
I'm not sure if I support Catalan independence. I usually dont like such drastic measures, but there is a strong case. Never thought much of it until we had a Catalan genius do a year in my school here in Ireland. He seemed so proud of Catalonia... but he did not have much time for Spain.

The other thing to realize is that education in America is a lot more balkanized that in Europe.  Most European countries have very centralized education systems with curriculum and funding coming down from a central source.  That leads to a consistently high standard.

America has some great schools, but also a lot of god awful ones, which pull down the average.  A high school in one school district can have a 98% graduation rate, while the one in the neighboring district can have a 40% rate.  Why this huge disparity?

A mechanical engineer teaching metal working at a vocational school is pretty common but technically they're ""incompetent"" unless they have completed a few dozen credits of pedagogic studies at a university.

Being ""formally unqualified"" is not as bad as you might think.

Having incompetent (in practice) teachers at vocational schools is another issue and I'm not denying that exists. Vocational/trade schools are the cesspools of the Finnish education system and generally have very low prestige both for students and teachers. Almost no one with a decent GPA goes to a vocational school after finishing the comprehensive school at 15-yo.

I haven't been on this subreddit/Reddit long enough to really have formed an opinion about that. What I do rember seeing though (sorry, don't remember the thread, might not even have been in r/europe) is that people tend to forget that Switzerland has a lot of companies as well, like Netslé, Roché etc, so I'd say that in the case of Switzerland it works the other way around, people forget they are a lot but their banks.

I've heard some racists comments in my life here in spain but nothing as stupid as that. 

Second, the racism against black people (if there is any) it's probably directed towards african people and not african americans or just black people from other countries. Why? Because inmigration. Many people that came from africa are delincuents so people here are tired of dealing with thieves and criminals from there. Of course, african criminals are a tiny part of all the african people that come here, but it happens as it happens everywhere, that inmigrants are all regarded as criminals when something bad happens. This doesn't happen only in Spain, it happens in USA, in UK, France, wherever you are. Second, I'm sorry but I fail to see the racism in that picture. I'm Spanish so I'm going to asume this is something spanish people think: the ""slave attire"" that you all see is no slave attire at all here. Those type of clothes are what spanish people have as the image of african people's clothes. Slave or not. It's a stereotype, but for black people, not for slaves.
To all the people that came here and dealed with a lot of racist comments: you just probably mingled with the wrong people. Ignorant people for sure. I'm 27, and I've never heard something like that from anybody younger than 60. Older people? Yeah, probably sometimes racist, but come on, are you really going to tell me you won't hear those kind of comments from ignorant people in their 70 in the states in the south? Yeah, nope. Honestly I've heard things 100 times worst from american people, and people just call them rednecks and go on with their lifes.

Blatant racism in the media?? Where?? Really, tell me because I'm more of the opinion that nowadays we take so seriously every joke that in Spain now you cannot make a joke without some group protesting for some stupid little reason.

I'm surprised by all the comments here. I mean, I'm not going to say there aren't racist people in Spain, that would be stupid, but from my perspective, there are just as much as in the UK, USA, France, etc... If you see more than what is usual, it's probably because you're hanging around with the wrong people or living in a tiny little town with people that haven't seen a black man ever.

Obviously, there are exceptions to this, and some Spaniards are genuinely accepting and non-racist. But they are definitely in a minority, especially in the younger generations. Oddly, the older generations appear more tolerant, but that may be down to the level of education where they do not publicly disclose their prejudiced views.

I spent 15 years living in Spain, and came to appreciate many aspects of the Spanish culture, but acceptance of foreigners and people of other creeds and races is something that is almost universally absent.",0,1346451803,null,0,false,0,c61o1sh,t3_z50al,t1_c61o1sh,t1_c61nkbj,null,1429786139,-1,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,-1

Maybe a little bit, but I can laugh about it too because I know they don't mean any harm with it and that doesnt mean the whole country is extremely racist.

I don't know if I'm being clear here. I'm not saying Spain isn't racist at all, all I'm saying is we are as racist as the next country. Sadly, you can see discrimination everywhere.

Also das Ding ist - ich seh's so, die Beschneidung gehört illegal, das Ohrenstechen von fünfjährigen aber mindestens ebenso. Religiöse Gründe sehe ich aufgrund der emotionalen Bedeutsamkeit im Grunde wichtiger an als ""sieht halt hübsch aus"" (bitte nicht falsch verstehen, ich bin wirklich, wirklich gegen Beschneidung von Kindern). Ein fünfjähriges Kind hat noch nicht zu entscheiden, was und wie es seinen Körper manipulieren kann. Deshalb entscheidet man in dem Alter auch weder, was man alles isst (Schokolade und Chips, dazu Cola?), noch wie man sich die Haare schneidet (Mitspracherecht ist was anderes). Wenn das kleine Kind ein kleines pinkes Herzchen am Ohr haben will, gibt es dazu Klip-Ohrringe, die nicht gestochen werden müssen. Genauso wird ein Rock nicht an die Hüfte getackert und die Entscheidung des Vaters, das zu unterstützen, hilft individuell dem Kind, das nämlich langfristig lernt, dass Röcke niemandem weh tun und es blöd ist, zu sagen, dass Nagellack nur für Mädchen ist, so wie der Gesellschaft und den vielen, vielen Leuten, die keinen Bock haben, in eine von zwei sehr engen Schubladen gequetscht zu werden.

Ohrringe für Kinder sind allerdings normal geworden, genau wie Beschneidung normal ist. Da dauert es viel länger, den Reflexionsprozess in Gang zu setzen, weil die Reaktion in der Regel ist ""wieso, machen wir doch alle schon seit Ewigkeiten, was ist denn jetzt plötzlich falsch dran?"".

Ich bin übrigens auch dafür, dass man sich als Deutscher noch lange, lange an die Vergangenheit erinnern sollte. Es war eben nicht nur einer allein, der das verbrochen hat, und es leiden heute noch Menschen darunter. Klar macht das keinen Spaß und ist unbequem, außerdem ist's mitunter auch ordentlich kompliziert, aber tja, Pech.
Das heißt andererseits aber nicht, dass man nicht gegen Beschneidung sein kann.

The people who I mixed with considered themselves very liberal and open, but when it came to race, they inexplicably defaulted to an antiquated attitude that pure Spaniards were superior to any and all immigrants to their great nation. This annoyed me greatly because these otherwise intelligent people had such a bigoted world view and could not see past their own prejudices. Of course, this attitude is found in almost every country to a greater or lesser extent, but in Spain it is almost a celebrated opinion.

Choose wisely where you want to live regarding your lifestyle, but if you want the full experience just find something in Paris, you'll pay more but coming from London you won't be disoriented.

Just my opinion.

No. I haven't concluded that. I've concluded that Soupias is an avid GD party supporter. Do you vote for them as well ?

Listen, you came to Spain, you met some spanish people that you thought were liberal but were not, they were probably some old country people, and you just made generalizations to the rest of the country and now all spaniards are extremely racist.

I can totally make a quick google search for ""uk racist incident"" or ""usa racist incident"" and I'm sure I'm going to see a lot of articles about different things, and I've seen a lot of tv from the uk and the usa, and seen a lot of racists jokes on there too. My conclusions are: there are racist people in the uk or france or wherever, just like there are here. Probably not many more or many less. Certainly it's not a celebrated opinion here because I don't see anymore of it here in tv than what I see in american or english television, and you said yourself you can find this attitude in every country to a greater or lesser extent, so...

Untrue. They reimbursed half of mine every month for 7 months while I was there. And I had the découverte. I lost mine once while riding on Vélib and couldn't get the subscription replaced, which was the big downside to having that one and not the one the locals use.
