Let's see...the city center itself is quite small, and you could probably see all the ~touristy bits in a day or two. But if you have an entire week here, you will probably enjoy your time here a lot more. There's a lot to do!

Some highlights:
- Go to Piazza Michelangelo for the sunset and bring some wine with you.

- If you're into the night life, a good summer club here is Flo. There is also YAB and Babylon, as well as Central Park. Don't go to Twice, 21 or Fullup. Trust me. 

- Piazza Santo Spirito at night

- Check out some bars, I like Mostodolce, Kikuya and Monkey Bar

- Check out the Uffizi and really take your time looking at some of the art

- Check out the natural history museum here

- Boboli Gardens for a nice view of the Tuscan hills

- There's a Tuesday market with delicious fresh produce over at the Cascine Park

- To relax, read a book, and have some coffee, check out La Cité Libreriacafè

- Best pizza in Firenze is Gusta Pizza near Santo Spirito (it's always packed, so get there early...it opens at 7PM)

- Best gelato in Firenze is Grom (my personal favorite) or Perché No

- San Lorenzo Leather Market

My favorite thing to do here personally is just to stroll along the Arno and enjoy the view.

Check out what events are going on as well.

You can take some day trips as well, such as:

- Siena
- San Gimignano
- Pisa (not really a fan of this city, but a lot of people want the photos from here)
- Viareggio
- Cinque Terre (absolutely beautiful!)

They also offer wine tasting tours and vespa tours here, although personally I never went on any of those. Some of my friends seemed to enjoy them though.

I provably can tell you a few places where to taste good food. The only thing is that, although I was born and raised in Benidorm, it's been almost 10 years since I left, so many places I remember may be out of business by now :/ I need to do some research and I'll be back to you as soon as I've got some reliable intel.

However, there is a place that I'm sure is still there, as it is one of the most popular places to eat tapas in Benidorm.

The area is commonly called ""La zona de los Vascos"" ( literally the vasc's zone), where you can find a lot, and I mean A LOT of places that serves high quality tapas, wines, ciders, and typical food and drinks in general. It is typical from the north of Spain, though (no paella). I definitely recommend it.

The most famous is called ""La Cava Aragonesa"", but there is another good one called ""Aurrera"".

I think it's important to point that out because it shows that Mr. Weidmann's strongly voiced opinions are not the only ones in Germany.

To the best of my knowledge - and I studied central banking quite a bit - it since very long that the central banks do not inject directly money in the economy ([seigniorage](http://www.economics-ejournal.org/economics/journalarticles/2007-10)). Any liquidity injection now take the form of borrowing.

But when a central bank lend money, it obviously create money out of thin air. So when you see that central bank ""lend"" something, you can read ""print"". The rate of interest of those ""borrowing"" is set inhouse by the ECB, and right now is quite low. So Italy, Span, etc, will, in fact, receive free money.

Does this free money will create inflation? Well I hope so! Right now we're in deflationary times, in other words, we're in a depression (did you notice? :) ). So, what we're doing now it's more similar to a [reflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflation).
Does this free money will create too much inflation? Time will tell, but most likely not.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Let's start to say that what the ECB is doing, it is not a bailout but something more like a quantitative easing. 

Sorry, I didn't make my self clear. I have never said that what they are doing is a bailout. People get angry when you use the acronym PIIGS, I don't have the energy to write out all the name all the time, but let say I mean those countries in the Eurozone with financial problems. I know they are not doing a bailout in the way Greece has been bailed out. 


&gt;But when a central bank lend money, it obviously create money out of thin air. So when you see that central bank ""lend"" something, you can read ""print"". The rate of interest of this ""borrowing"" is set in house by the ECB, and right now is quite low. So Italy, Span, etc, will - in fact - receive free money.

Well, yes, that is correct,(partly) in the way money is created. I pointed that out in another thread, with [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ECB_balance_sheet.png) balance sheet (which I stole over at r/economics). So, more money will be in circulation, and the inflation will increase I agree with you there.

Where you are wrong however is that the money is ""free"" - the money is not free. Inflation carries with it all whole other set of costs, so don't say that there is free money.

What more, Draghi has said, to appease the Germans, that it will be financed by sterilization, ie. borrowing, not by the printing press (I think he means money will not really be created by the printing press). There is no such thing as free loans, and who is going to pay for these loans? Particularely since he has promised it will be ""limitless"". The money to pay for this will not come from the southern states, but from the northern - limitless apparently.

So, I do not understand how you can call it ""free money"", it is not in any sense, there is no such thing.The northern taxpayers will cough up, and they will also suffer from inflation (the inflation will affect the south too, but they will not be tasked with financing Draghi's limitless borrowing). 

What more, ECB's main task is *price stability*, i.e. inflation. What the ECB is doing now is the opposite of that. They are working in very, very grey areas, and while I can understand why they are doing it, one can not keep ignoring and dancing around the law like that. 

The democratic deficit, and the disregard for the charters is a whole different area though, but the way the Eurozone is working now is really showing its true colours, and not in a good way.

It is very quiet, clean, and safe, but definitely not a very exciting city.  I found it very boring when I was young, but now that I am in my 30s and settled down, it's an ideal place to live, if that makes sense.

&gt; Will it be fun for a single 30 year old?

What things do you find fun?  You're here during the [Altstadtfest](http://www.altstadtfest-nue.de/), so there will be a *lot* of people out.  It's not as crowded as during the Christmas Market, but it's still very difficult to get a seat at one of the beer cabins in the evening.

&gt; Is it cosmopolitan and international?

It is ""international"" in that something like 20% of the residents were born outside of Germany, but I wouldn't really describe it as being an ""international city"" like Frankfurt or Berlin, and I definitely wouldn't call it ""cosmopolitan"".  

&gt; Can I get by speaking only a few words in german?

Yes, in the altstadt (which is everything within the city walls) and other tourist areas, you'll be fine.

**Lots of surplus energy**

**Germany is, in spite of turning off their nuclear power plants, increasing its role as net exporter. Clean energy is covering 30% of the domestic consumption.**

The workforce energy bilance (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Energiebilanzen) has presented the energy statistics for the first half of 2012, which is worth reading like every year. In spite of moaning, Germany is keeping its role as net exporter. The scare story that Germany just increases its dependence on foreign nuclear energy wasn't true after all.

[Table 1](http://www.heise.de/bilder/152735/0/1)

The table shows that, although the imports from France are still quite strong, Germany is increasingly exporting to other countries. In sum 10 Billion kWh more have been exported in the first half of 2012 than imported. For comparison: In the first half of 2011, while Germany was running more nuclear plants, 4 Billion kWh have been exported. A year earlier it has been 10,9 Billion kWh. In spite of 1/3 less produced nuclear energy Germany landed on the same export range like before. That's all what's left to say to the fear mongers about security of supply. (sic)

[Table 2](http://www.heise.de/bilder/152735/1/1)

The next graph shows where the surplus is coming from. While the old basic plants produce more or less the same amount of energy to make as much money as possible while they can, the new sustainable energy sources are increasing strongly. With 70 Billion kWh those energy sources now account for 25% of the production. If you deduct export and own consumption the percentage is at nearly 30%.

That means it's time for new horror stories. Missing storage isn't true, how about another song about unreliability? Just now RWE demonstrated how reliable modern stone age plants are (sic). It's a piece of cake if 2,1 gigawatt are missing from one second to another. The nets can handle that hands down. Hamburg had no real problems when the nuclear powerplants Brunsbüttel and Krümmel failed in sequence in June 2007. It would be way worse if the wind turbines would fall down. (BTW: The revenue of wind and solar plants can be calculated with 90% accuracy).

[Table 3](http://www.heise.de/bilder/152735/2/1)

For the end, while we're at statistics, let's have look on the prices of imported crude oil. As you can see, the combination of a high world market price and a not so overpowered Euro has pumped the price up now, higher than the record level of 2008. Considering the economy crisis in the industrial centers it's a remarkable development which shows an increasing scarcity. You could say: Peak oil is near

No. What I'm talking about is making banks Europe companies, in short they would be detached from member states: paying their taxes to the EU, not to member states.

I've found out that some of my favorite bars and restaurants have been closing down since I left :( but, in addition to ""la zona de los vascos"", I can recommend you a couple more places.

First things first:
[Los Vascos](http://goo.gl/maps/pGT9I)

Here is the Vasc area that I mentioned earlier. You can see La Cava Aragonesa and Bar Gorbea. If you walk though the passage in the middle of these two, there are one or two more good places right inside it, and one hundred more in the street at the other side. You also can access it through the street at the right hand side of the view. Just bear in mind that those are mainly pedestrian only. Look for a ""sidreria"" (or cider bar) around the block. I'm sure it has to be at least one left,  where you can taste natural asturian cider. The way they pour the drink into the glasses is pretty peculiar.

Now, two of my favorites. These aren't in the city center, but located a bit more inland, to the north. They are absolutely **not touristic places**, nor fancy, or even appealing at first sight, but here you will find the real deal. They are close to ""El Cruce"", a kind of a landmark in Benidorm (which is is, literally, a crossroad with a lot of trafic lights).

[Bar Pucela](http://goo.gl/maps/vr3xW) is the regular bar/restaurant where local people go to have a coffee and chat, a vermouth with a few olives or a jar of beer with ""pinchos morunos"" (spiced meat skewers) and ""gambas al ajillo"" (garlic prawns).

[Freiduria Los Peces](http://goo.gl/maps/d5S3a) is the typical fried fish bar. Everything in the menu is awesome, but I love the ""chopitos"" (light battered baby squid) and ""pescado en adobo"" (battered fish). May be a bit crowded sometimes, but it's worth it, and you can even ask anything to take away, so you can eat it in the confort of your hotel/apartment. Ah! and for desserts, there is a small ice cream place called La Jijonenca, about 50mtrs down the avenue. You can ask for an ""Horchata"" (vegetable drink made with chufas), or a ""Blanco y Negro"" (iced coffee base with cinnamon and lemon zest infused milk icecream on top).

Finally, if you have a car, you can go here:

http://www.lasfuentesdelalgar.com/home.htm

It is a beautiful place where to expend the whole day. There are a few different restaurants, and yes, you can order a pretty good paella (as far as I remember) and many other rice specialities, as well as meats and fish. Look for the ""where to eat"" link at the website.

Payin the taxes to the EU? Don't you mean the ECB? The EU do not have the Euro, and I will fight to the last of my dying breath not to get any Swedish anything (including banks) to get more caught up in this slowly unfolding, non democratic tragic crash. And - I mean, you do not pay taxes to institutions, you pay them to states. In addition, ECB who is making deals with the banks can not collect their taxes. Also, taxes are set by democratic elected bodies, parlaments, and the ECB is the opposite of that. All of a sudden Draghi insists that Finnish banks have had it to easy, so they need an extra tax. Do you think that is above him, or whomever who is next?

It is not just competition, it is - everything basically to corruption, to rigid labour laws, to to high wages to -well, all of it. Debt is a part of it, but you do not clean up debt by banks going bust. If you look at Sweden or Finland, who has both lowered their national debt, it has happened by growth, paying it off, sensible state finances, building up competitivness on the world market, trust in the system etc......Non of that is happening, at all at the moment in the affected countries,.

At least for now. Sometimes you have to break rules in order to preserve something, and if that something is very valuable to you, then you can afford to break rules quite much.

&gt;  Greece wouldn't take the banking sector with them, not any more, just their own. 

We don't want to do that, because it would take their private sector too. What we want to do is to shield both the banking sector and the private sector so after the state has made a default, new growth can be based on them. Not to mention that it isn't right to punish private individuals and companies from the mistakes of the state.

&gt; Payin the taxes to the EU? Don't you mean the ECB? The EU do not have the Euro, and I will fight to the last of my dying breath not to get any Swedish anything (including banks) to get more caught up in this slowly unfolding, non democratic tragic crash.

Do you think that is above him, or whomever who is next? 

EU or Euroarea, doesn't matter that much. Just replace EU with Euroarea in your mind if I happen to mention EU.

The reason why banks need to pay their taxes to the Euroarea/ECB is that if the ECB/Banking agency is going to cover bank failures, then also benefits of banking must go to the one who is carrying the risks - no risks, no benefits.

Another reason for this is because the Euroarea has moved into SEPA system where the whole area has become one domestic banking area for all Eurozone banks, for consumers it doesn't matter if your banks is Finnish, Spanish or German, it is the same. In essence what has happened is that we have common European banking market, and in time, probably after the current crisis has been solved, there will be a huge merging of European banks into huge Europe wide banks. In this future market risks and tasks are so huge that no member state can answer for them.

Well, then, to me not being part of limitless transfers, and being rules by the democratically elected is important, and I am not about to give that up. But if the Eurozone countries do not care about democracy, laws and think limitless transfers are fine - sure, go ahead by all means. The problem is that you are trying to drag us with you in you non democratic endavours, + you want money for them too. 

&gt;EU or Euroarea, doesn't matter that much. Just replace EU with Euroarea in your mind if I happen to mention EU.

You do know that you have to create a federation for that to happen? That will, even if everyone agrees to that, take years. Also, it *does* matter. The Eurozone is even more non democratic than the EU, so it is important. And, the Eurozone costs more and frankly, makes more stupid decisions (but that might just be because they have more of a chance).

&gt;The reason why banks need to pay their taxes to the Euroarea/ECB is that if the ECB/Banking agency is going to cover bank failures, then also benefits of banking must go to the one who is carrying the risks - no risks, no benefits.

Why? Why not make a proper bank save like in Sweden, and increase the laws? Why make it harder than it is when it's not necessary? 

&gt; In this future market risks and tasks are so huge that no member state can answer for them.

Well, that is not happening yet, and I'd start with the little problem of the depression before that.

&gt;Yes, but it is better to do something, even if that something only has barely satisfiable results, than to do nothing.

Agree, but you said it would solve the crises. I am saying, and this is also one of the reasons I claim that the transfers are permanent, that it doesn't help if you fix a whole floor if you do not have a roof. Many of this countries have neither roof nor floor, so fixing the banks and saying it will be a ""just for this time"" non democratic decision and ""just for this time"" transfers, is just lying to oneself. The ECB just instigated permanent transfers, whom I believe wont solve the issue either, since nothing is being done to solve the real problems at hand. Good luck Finland, you are going to need it.

A nuclear power plant's output cannot be modulated because the nuclear reaction cannot be modulated.

&gt; You can modulate the reaction a bit, and if you cant, then simply dump the excess heat somewhere else than into the generator connected to the grid (for example into coupled hydrogen production plant, if you still want to use it). Hell, dump the excess electricity into resistors, if there is no other option.

It's not that simple. *All* the heat in the water system under pressure that has been added by the nuclear reaction needs to be removed in the course of one cycle. This is water under pressure, hence the temperature can increase far beyond the boiling point of water. If not enough heat has been removed in one cycle the heat increase will be incremental until failure or until emergency shutdown. This is why the generator needs to provide enough load for all the heat in the water to be removed.",0,1347023010,null,0,false,0,c64ru1x,t3_zhydd,t1_c64ru1x,t1_c64rq6n,null,1429840021,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Why can you subtract Luxembourg? Because the country should be treated essentially as a part of Germany in terms of electrical energy, as it has little generation of its own.

However, as appears, German electrical balance has had positive trends recently. The imports were [decreasing after a peak] (http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=83&amp;c=gm&amp;l=en) and the exports remained [steady after a period of growth](http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=gm&amp;v=82).

At the first glance the situation looks healthy. But, if we look at [consumption](http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=81&amp;c=gm&amp;l=en) and [production](http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=79&amp;c=gm&amp;l=en), we shall see that both have reached a plateau in recent years, which I could only attribute to the effect of the economic recession.

What can we conclude?
First, that Germany has no immediate energy crisis, probably due to [increased capital investment in energy generation starting in 2006](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online/link/tabelleErgebnis/43211-0001) in anticipation of the abolition of the nuclear. However, despite the increased investment, the production has reached a plateau, which is not a good sign.

According to Morgan Stanley the Netherlands will be the only core country with economic struggles this year. The prognosis of a mild recovery in 2013 is according to the bank under pressure because of important political decisions before and after the election on 12th of September.

The bank believes that the consumers play a big part in the development of the Dutch economy. ""Netherlanders seem to have more troubles with the necessity of paying back their debt. The uncertainty is also growing because of austerity measures and the weak job market.""

Netherlands also suffer more under a large devaluation of their houses and grumble about the hits against their pension founds due to the financial crisis. They also have the highest mortgage load within the Euro zone. It's not surprising that the biggest part of their income is spent on their rent. According to Morgan Stanley: ""The house market is a potential big danger for the state. The Nationale Hypotheek Garantie (national mortgage guaranty) alone is as big as 24% of the GDP"".

The consumer spendings were decreasing every quarter in 2011 and will decrease further this year. ""Depending on the extent of the austerity measures the state will push a further decrease in 2013 is possible"", says Morgan Stanley. The spendings are further decreases by high energy prices, an announced BTW increase and a weaker job market.

According to the bank the customer trust will stay on a low level. The trust isn't far under the eurozone average, ""but it's weak compared to other core countries""

The museum of natural history may not be huge, but the visit will take some time. And count very long queues if you want to go up the Eiffel tower.

No, you are correct.

No, it does no. But neither does the zones 1-3 pass as CDG is in zone 5. Are you arriving from CDG on the first day too ? If so what you can do is take a zone 1-5 mobilis on the day you arrive and take a single-journey ticket on the next day. If not, only take zones 1-2 on the first day.

It's not only every day racism, when people just go in front of them in line at the supermarket (yes, this is happening to foreigners very often), but foreigners actually get killed just because they are foreigners. More than 150 in Germany since 1990. A lot more get beaten up. 

I know that foreigners also beat up other people (or foreigners as well), but it's a size thing. When you are black and live in a white country, you feel very sensitive about white people complaining about black culture.

true,Eeko,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Something practical is tens of years away.

Umm... No. Today, we have around 400 combined reactor years of experience of running different types of fast breeder reactors. Yes, every one of them have been more or less of ""prototypes"", but that doesn't mean they aren't generating electricity as we speak. Strictly speaking, ""old-fashioned"" reactors being built today (like the one in Olkiluoto 3) are also prototypes of designs not used before. Still, they are bought to generate electricity to the greater grid.

A number of nuclear waste burning fast breeder reactors have already been decommisioned, such as BC-350. BN-600 is operating right now (although it was supposed to be shut down already as well), so is CEFR,  Jōyō and FBTR. Russia and India are building new, bigger prototypes as we speak and there are a few planned to be deployed before 2020. GE Hitachi has already promised to deliver their IFR-based S-PRISM for the UK.

Then there are also the Thorium projects lagging a bit behind. They too can burn existing fuels.

What we have to wait a bit longer (I'd estimate around 10 years if we could ditch our no-nukes paranoia) is to be able to deploy those things en masse. IFR would have been estimated done by now if they wouldn't have been sacked. Their mission included the development of mass-deployable Fast Breeder reactors. It takes a while to get back on track, but the tech is still pretty much closer to completion than any alternative.

Clean coal? Likely impossible, still more than 20 years away. Efficient solar? We won't likely have enough rare minerals for mass-deployment, but still mass-deployability is 100 years away. Fusion? It has been 50 years away since the '50s. ITER is the second prototype. From fast breeders and thorium, we have dozens of prototypes with hundreds of years of running experience. Wind, geothermal... Their scalability is still questioned.

What we have *today*, is a few very solid designs for 3rd generation nuclear plants we can use for the next 10-20 years if needed. The tech most likely to be matured by then is the 4th gen nuclear. If I would have to make the bet on life on this planet on something, I would go with nukes. Hands down.

(
What I'm most sceptical about is whether we would actually start burning the existing nuclear waste in a while, since uranium and thorium are too abundant in Earth's crust. I think it was an MIT study claiming that recycling nuclear fuel won't be economically sensible in the next 50-100 years compared to just running 3 times as many current-gen EPR's as today with freshly mined uranium. 

Just to give an insight into what it really means to measure energy output closer to E = mc^2 than E = ½mv^2 , it's estimated that just the current reserves of depleted uranium ammo of US Army could be used to fuel the entire Earth (with approximately 9 billion people having a western standard of living) for the next 200 years. We have plenty more of nuclear waste, weapons and unmined reserves to be burned. We would really have to start some pretty energy intensive projects in order to get rid of our current nuclear waste. Even tens of thousands of years of radioactive decay might come sooner than our actual need to use it.

""More than 1 million immigrants have arrived in Greece over the course of two decades, contributing significantly to the improvement of the demographic and economic profile of the country. But since 2008, Greece has plummeted into economic turmoil in what may well be the worst recession in recent memory.

In tandem with these devastating financial woes has been an increase in illegal immigration from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, primarily through the country's porous land and sea borders with Turkey. Greece has truly become the gateway to Europe for hundreds of thousands of unauthorized immigrants: In 2010 alone, nearly 133,000 people were apprehended for unauthorized entry or stay in Greece — a number that has decreased since the deployment of specialized Frontex teams in the region in October 2010.

Taken together, the country's recent economic decline, highly porous borders, growing xenophobia, and ineffective legal and institutional framework for the regularization and integration of immigrants have created a fragile environment for the management of immigration.""",0,1347035260,null,0,false,0,c64upl7,t3_zi3u2,t1_c64upl7,t1_c64ulh4,null,1429841375,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Nansen is a great example of this. His tireless help for the people suffering after World War I. His [Nansen passport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nansen_passport) helped almost half a million stateless people find home and migrate to where they wanted to live.

For most of the volume, yes.
 The only waste specific to plants is long life and high-activity waste which accounts for a tiny volume. For example you could fit all that France have ever produced in a pool (although it wouldn't stay in their for long). If you find a solution for one pool, you can easily scale it for two pools.

I think it's probably also a possibility to provide free tests for people that can't afford them. What are you doing when you think you could have a STD and you can afford a test? You pay for it without questioning the price.

I'd say that while the queues are HUGE during the day, they are only long at night ;) However, since it closes rather late, you can probably make it if you put it at the end of your day.

Also if it's the view you're interested in, the one from the top of the Montparnasse tower is nice too and it's less crowded. But then you don't get to tell your friends that you've been to the top of the Eiffel tower :)

&gt; Is it open only during certain period of time or did you mean because of the rush?

I've never been to the Frigos so I don't really know how that works. But my understanding was that you could only visit when there are special exhibitions or when they have an open house. But I may be wrong.

&gt; Any idea on the fare?

Paris &lt;--&gt; CDG by RER: 9.25€.
Mobilis 1-2: 6.40€.
Mobilis 1-5: 15.20€.
single ticket for zone 1 only: 1.70€ or 12.70€ for 10.
So buying a Mobilis 1-5 at CDG would be a little bit cheaper than single journey + Mobilis 1-2.

Note that Mobilis is not the same as Paris Visite. Paris Visite is the one they advertise to tourists. It's a bit more expensive but offers a few discounts on some sights. For you Mobilis is a better deal. The inconvenient is that you can't buy it before coming to Paris, while many websites and tour operators sell Paris Visite throughout the world.",0,1347054450,null,0,false,0,c65000n,t3_zgw8h,t1_c65000n,t1_c64ws1x,null,1429843938,2,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,2

true,leechnerd,null,null,"I'm a foreigner (US) studying in Germany, so I think I can help answer if it hasn't been answered already (and from an American PoV).

&gt; Do you need a Masters Degree to enter a German PhD program? (In the US, you go right into a PhD which takes ~ 5 years, from what I've seen in Germany you need 2 years MS then you do 3 year PhD.)

Absolutely*. One of the strangest things when I came here was that in the US I had just gotten a BSc in engineering, and back there this meant that I knew something and people respected that, enough to make investments in you to fund your PhD for 5+ years you know? Here in Germany having a BSc gets you no respect and you're still viewed as a student who doesn't know much or anything. The reason is complicated but the short version is because Germany 'recently' changed their university system to a 3 year BSc + 2 year MSc program, and prior to that it was a 5 year program culminating in a ""diplom,"" an equivilant to a US MSc. In many fields the mindset is still ""3+2"" so a lot of people view having a BSc as being somewhat of an ""incomplete"" education. IMO the extra year we have in the US for a BSc makes a huge amount of difference and prepares us for academic research for a PhD, but the Germans don't view it that way.

But you might have noticed I wrote absolutely* meaning there's a caveat. So your ""standard"" PhD program in Germany is really more like employment. You sign an employment contract for a project with a lab/institute for X years, and your main work is that project and whatever other institutional matters they want you to do (say TAing). You're a fully recognized employee and take no classes officially (thoughthe professor that employs you, and the professor does employ you directly kinda) might want you to take his classes or some classes to brush up on things, but this would be in an unofficial sense. At the end of your work contract, you're *allowed* to submit a PhD thesis. You don't have to (but then why would you be working there), which can result in a PhD.

The *other* option is a relatively new system in Germany called a Graduate School. This one is more modeled after the US PhD system. Instead of applying to a professor for a specific job, you apply to the graduate school for placement. Graduate schools offer joint MSc+PhD programs, so you can start with your BSc right away. Graduate schools are also typically faster as you won't have teaching duties and your ""job"" is your PhD research.

In both cases you would be paid a salary (traditional PhD) or a stipend (graduate school).

&gt; Do you get payed with a stipend as a German PhD student? In the US, we get $20-$25,000 a year and tuition is waved.

Partially answered but will expand. In Germany tuition doesn't really exist. In my state we pay 0€ tuition (of course there are other fees that add up to a couple hundred per semester), in other states the tuition is 500€ per semester (+fees). It's a huge contrast that we bitch about paying 500€ here vs US students bitching about paying $20000 a year or whatever crazy amount. So that's tuition.

PhD payment is based on the standard TV-L scale set by (I think) the federal government. This means that *everybody* will get paid the same base salary, with differences coming from things like marriage, children, religion, and so on. As a starting first year PhD your net salary will be roughly 1800€ per month after taxes or so, with this amount increasing every year. The really shitty thing about this is that your base salary doesn't get adjusted based on living expenses. So you're doing a PhD in Munich, one of the most expensive cities in Germany? Too bad, you're poorer because you spend more money on rent now than compared to doing a PhD in a cheaper city. Graduate schools on the other hand get paid a stipend, which is untaxed so it's probably more than what you'd get as a regular PhD. On the otherhand, with the stipend you won't be paying into like a pension fund for retirement (yes, you get one too, if you decide to stay).

&gt; Do I have to approach an adviser personally and ask him to take me into his PhD program? 

You will have to visit the website of institutes/labs you are interested in working for and seeing if they have any open positions. If they do, you send *the professor* an application (typical application package includes a CV with your picture on it (weird right?), transcripts, motivation/research interests letter, and letters of recommendation (like, not names of contacts, but actual letters that your references have already written for you—again, weird right?)). If there are no open positions available then you can try to send an unsolicited email, and maybe if your credentials are *that good* then the professor will make a position for you. If you don't have a MSc unfortunately you're just not going to be considered for reasons I already explained. In this case your only choices are 1) apply for a MSc program in Germany (which will be unfunded), or 2) apply for a MSc+PhD combined graduate school program.

Got any questions? Just ask or PM me.

Edit: Saw that you wrote you were lost in all the universities. Since you're not going to get into a PhD program without a MSc, like I said you've got two choices: 1) apply for a regular MSc, or 2) apply for a ""Graduate School."" For the former, maybe if you write on /r/deutschland to ask what the ""best"" schools for chemistry are, they could help you. But to be honest, in Germany there really isn't that much of a distinction between ""most"" of the schools so my advice is honestly choose a city you would like to live in, like Berlin or Hamburg. You can always move to another city to do a PhD once you get ""in"" and finish your MSc. Another thing you can do is look up ""german excellence universitities"" on wikipedia/google and there's a list of what the federal government considers the best performing universities; the new list was posted a few months back. To apply for a graduate school, go to dfg.de and look at the list of funded graduate schools and check them out. DFG is like the NSF of Germany and they fund all/most of the graduate schools.",0,1347056065,null,0,1347057055,0,c650efu,t3_zgbu1,t1_c650efu,t3_zgbu1,null,1429844124,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

Accomodation can cost about 200 a month if you share an apartment with other students in the middle of Valencia. For food, if you just do groceries you might want to save 20 euros a week. Of course if you like going out that changes. A full three course lunch at a cafe can cost you anything from 8-12 euros.

&gt;What did you get up to for fun?

A good place to hit up at the beginning of the night is El Barrio del Carmen. There you will find lots of bars. I recommend [Blanco y Rojo](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Blanco-Y-Rojo-Cocktail-Bar/364910530209831) for amazing cocktails, [Casa Matilde](https://plus.google.com/102347629499710977826/about?gl=es&amp;hl=en) for really cheap shots and [Radio City](http://radiocityvalencia.es/) for dancing and drinking. Either way, there are always people on the street offering discounts for places so there's always lots of different bars to discover.

If discos are more your thing, el Puerto area has all the best clubs. [La 3](http://www.facebook.com/latres.valencia) usually has a really good scene but if mainstream is more your thing there is always [Ánimas](http://www.lasanimasdelpuerto.com/).

&gt;Is it easy to visit the other Major cities? How long does it take to get to Barcelona/Madrid?

You can get a bus ticket to Barcelona or Madrid for around 20 euros. It's a 4 hour trip to Madrid, about 3 hours to Barcelona. You can find more information on that [here](http://www.avanzabus.com/web/destinos-y-estaciones/estaciones-de-autobus/estacion-de-autobuses-de-valencia.html).

I don't go to the Polytechnic University of Valencia but I know quite a few people that do. Be prepared for huge classes and meeting a lot of Spanish party people. People are really open here so don't get taken back when we start asking you lots of questions. We're just trying to be friendly. :)

Also, I recommend learning all the Spanish you can get. I've heard professors there aren't very fluent in English, even if you're in the English course.

I've been trying for so long to hear from a US student in the situation I hope to be in in the future, and though I get a lot of help from some German friends, they are already used to their system.

I've scoured over the DAAD.DE website numerous times, but just end up with 50 browser tabs open and get overwhelmed and X out after a while.  I applied to the DAAD RISE program as an undergrad for two years but wasn't accepted.  

I've never stumbled upon the DFG so I will check out that website.

I had heard Germany was trying to move to a ""graduate school"" type system where you would have a board of advisers vs one single PI.  

I have some serious life decisions to figure out.  Apply for graduate school in the US for next fall...or apply for a MS in Germany.  Going to Germany would be great, but if I found after the 2 year MS that I wanted to return home, I'd have to start a PhD program in the US all over again and put in 5 years probably.  

Were GRE's necessary for acceptance into the programs in Germany?

I wouldn't mind hearing more about your personal journey if you'd be willing to share in comments or PM.  Did you go into a MS program with a US Bachelors, or right into a PhD program?  As much as I like Munich, I'm already $25,000 in debt from my US bachelors, and parents have no money, so I'd need to get a MS funded by a US group like the Rotary club etc or just go into a PhD program with funding.

The #1 question I get asked over here is ""Why did you leave the US, when so many people would do *anything* to get into the US to study?"" This kinda shows when you look at the research based rankings and see that the top 50 are all from the US with some European ones sprinkled here and there. But anyway the graduate school system probably differs from different universities, but as I understand it, there is a board of people who review applicants (like in the US) and if you get in you spend the first years doing course work (like in the US) before choosing your advisor and research. The traditional PhD route you just skip all that (because you already have a MSc) and choose a professor and apply for a specific job (or have one created for you, if you're good enough).

&gt; I have some serious life decisions to figure out. Apply for graduate school in the US for next fall...or apply for a MS in Germany. Going to Germany would be great, but if I found after the 2 year MS that I wanted to return home, I'd have to start a PhD program in the US all over again and put in 5 years probably. 

Why not apply for both? Actually bad news—the ""fall"" semester (actually called winter here) starts in October, next month. So it's probably a bit too late now, unless you mean for next year.

&gt; Were GRE's necessary for acceptance into the programs in Germany?

I only applied to one university here, and they did not require it. It's a known thing here though, so if you did take it and did really awesome it couldn't hurt to send it too, but it won't hurt if you didn't send the results since nobody else will have sent one.

&gt; So hard to chose between a foreign country you've been enthralled with for years...or stay at home where you are more ""secure"". Pretty big leap of faith. So many questions...but I won't bombard you all at once.

It was a huge gamble for me too cause I got accepted to some good universities in the US as well. In the end I took the choice of adventure :).",0,1347063195,null,0,false,0,c6520vg,t3_zgbu1,t1_c6520vg,t1_c651h6v,null,1429844941,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

Forgive me, because I'm not trying to be political about this and  seem disrespectful.  Maybe Obama did have good intentions with his healthcare plan.  But I've seen too much from his administration to actually believe he is one of the good guys.  To be completely honest with you, I see him as a corporatist.  I believe he would rather serve the corporations than the American people.  Even before he was president he voted for the bank bailout (TARP).  At the convention he is touting his auto bailout and how he saved GM.  You will probably say it was about jobs, but I see it as funneling free cash to a shitty corporation.  I see a president violating our civil rights, and expanding our involvement in the middle east where we should no longer be.

Then why did he champion a reform that requires insurance companies to apply 80-85% of your premium payments to actual health care instead of profit or advertising?

Why did his administration establish a consumer protection bureau that has gone after credit card companies for ripping off consumers?

Why has he made it easier for students to get loans?

Let me ask you this: do you think any president could govern while ignoring the needs of large banks and corporations?  Do you think people like you and I would do well if banks weren't loaning money and jobs weren't kept and created in America?  Policies can benefit both business and ordinary people; the two are not mutually exclusive.  There is also nothing wrong with running a business and trying to make a profit.

&gt;I see it as funneling free cash to a shitty corporation.

The cash came with restructuring requirements.  It wasn't free, and if those jobs had been lost, they wouldn't have been replaced by new American companies.  They would have been gone for good.
